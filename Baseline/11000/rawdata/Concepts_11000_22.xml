[[Image:20-sided dice 250.jpg|thumb|200px|A typical twenty-sided die]]
The '''3d20''' system is the [[role-playing game system]] used in ''[[Neuroshima]]'' and ''[[Monastyr]]''. Like the [[d20 System]], it uses twenty-sided [[dice]], but unlike that system it most typically uses three.

==Core mechanic==
#name the skill to be tested and the difficulty level
#roll three twenty sided [[dice]]
#compare all three separate results with the given [[Attribute (role-playing games)|attribute]]
#if at least two of the three results are lower than the attribute modified by the difficulty level, test is successful.

==Details==
When a test is required, the [[Gamemaster]], names the [[Skill (role-playing games)|skill]] which is going to be tested (or a raw [[Attribute (role-playing games)|attribute]], if no skill is available for the activity the [[Player character|character]] is trying to perform). He also sets a difficulty level for the test, which modifies the attribute value (reducing or improving it). Then, the character's skill level is taken into account - if the character does not have any skill levels in the given skill, (in case of [[Neuroshima]]) the difficulty level is raised by one, or (in case of [[Monastyr]]), all the three rolls (not two) have to be lower than the tested attribute. Otherwise, the player can subtract a total of his character's skill levels in that skill from any of the three dice rolls, each separately.

===Special rules===
*'''Suwak''' ("Slider") is a special rule of this game system. It says that when a character has at least four 4 levels in a skill, each time that skill is tested, the difficulty level is automatically lowered by one; if their skill level is 8 or 12, then difficulty is lowered by two or three levels respectively. It's supposed to depict the fact that the more trained a character becomes, the easier those things they trained seem to them. 
*'''Lucky 1''' - each time when making a test roll a player rolls "1" on any dice, he is lucky and manages to perform easily; in the terms of mechanics, the test is treated as if the difficulty level was lower by one. ''Notice:'' if the player rolls two "1's", the test is automatically successful.

'''''A Satire of the Three Estates''''' ([[Middle Scots]]: ''Ane Pleasant Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis''), is a [[satirical]] [[morality play]] in [[Middle Scots]], written by [[makar]] [[David Lyndsay|Sir David Lyndsay]]. The complete play was first performed outside in the playing field at [[Cupar]], [[Fife]] in June 1552 during the Midsummer holiday, where the action took place under Castle Hill. It was subsequently performed in [[Edinburgh]], also outdoors, in 1554. The full text was first printed in 1602 and extracts were copied into the ''[[Bannatyne Manuscript]]''. The ''Satire'' is an attack on the [[Three Estates#The Three Estates|Three Estates]] represented in the [[Parliament of Scotland]] – the clergy, lords and burgh representatives, symbolised by the characters ''Spiritualitie'', ''Temporalitie'' and ''Merchant''. The clergy come in for the strongest criticism. The work portrays the social tensions present at this pivotal moment in [[Scottish history]].

==Synopsis==
A complete version of the play was printed by Robert Charteris as, ''Ane (Pleasant) Satyre of the Thrie Estaits, in Commendation of Vertew and Vituperation of Vyce'', Edinburgh (1602).&lt;ref&gt;"Pleasant" appears in the title on the first page of the play, not on the title-page of Charteris's (1602) edition.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first part there are 27 different characters. In the second part seven more are added. The key characters are; King Humanity, Divine Correction, Sensuality, Spirituality, Temporality, Gude Counsel and Chastity.

The play opens with Diligence delivering a sermon on good kingship. The main character, young King Humanity, then appears and is at first led astray by Sensuality and the Vices. His false counsellors introduce him to a mistress, Sensuality, which is the starting point of his disconnection from the moral way of life. He is then fooled by three disguised liars. Gude Counsel is sent to prison by the liars who already have taken control of King Humanitie's mind. With the beginning of his lecherous new life the king forgets about the moral virtues and can no longer judge properly. He consigns Charity and Verity to the stocks. In the course of the following scenes the audience sees how the three so called Vices (Discretion, Devotion and Sapience) try to get rid of everything and everyone who could be dangerous to them. For instance Lady Chastitie, who is homeless since the church in Scotland is not as it was meant to be, begs for shelter from Spiritualitie, Temporalitie and finally the People but is rejected in each case. In the end when Lady Chastitie is sent to prison by the Vices, Divine Correction enters the stage. This is the moment when the vices know that their time has come to an end and they flee and take away the king’s treasure box. Correction frees Gude Counsel, Chastitie and Vertie. He advises the young king to call a parliament and gives him advice regarding a successful reign.

The second part starts with an interruption. A member of the King's realm, known only as The Poor Man, emerges from the audience, establishes an alliance with John Commonweal to demand reform, and Diligence reappears to announce that the King will seek to improve his realm. Afterwards the Pardoner enters the scene and tries to sell pardoners. Poor Man hears that and buys pardoners worth ‘ane groat’. But Poor Man is not satisfied and gets angry and so they start to argue. In the following scene Diligence opens parliament and King Humanitie, Correction, the king’s courtiers and the virtues enter. The three estates greet the king and parliament is opened. John Commonweal stands up and talks to the King and Correction. He reveals all the failures of the estates. In the course of the following hearing Temporalitie gets punished but as this estate wants to cooperate this is just a short episode. Spiritualitie does not agree on what is said about their estate and fights back. But there are too many accusations against this estate and therefore they also have to give in. The three Vices are imprisoned and sentenced to be hanged. Flatterie tried to get away by betraying his fellows Falsehood and Deceit but this did not work. In the end of the second part the three vices Deceit, Falsehood and Flatterie are allowed to say something before they are hanged. After the execution of the vices  and a rousing speech by Folie, Diligence closes the play and advises the audience to go their ways and enjoy their time.&lt;ref&gt;Edington, Carol, ''Court &amp; Culture in Renaissance Scotland'', pp.221-224&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sixteenth century performances==

===Interlude at Linlithgow, 1540===
[[File:Linlithgowpalace 180609 - 03.jpg|thumb| The 1540 interlude was performed in the hall of [[Linlithgow Palace]]]]
The 1931 edition of Lindsay's works by Douglas Hamer hypothesized different forms of the play.&lt;ref&gt;Hamer, Douglas, ''Works of Sir David Lindsay of the Mount'', vol.2, Scottish Text Society (1931-4), pp.1-8&lt;/ref&gt; The critic John MacQueen proposed the play might have composed by Lindsay as early as 1532 for the court of the young [[James V of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen, ''Ane Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis'', ''SSL''(1965-6), 129-43.&lt;/ref&gt; An early form of the play is recorded in the [[Treasurer of Scotland|royal treasurer's accounts]] and an English agent's report to [[Thomas Cromwell]].&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol.7 (1907), pp.276-7, purchase of costumes in Jan. 1540&lt;/ref&gt; This short play or 'interlude' performed in January 1540 used characters who later appeared in the ''Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis'', and had the same themes.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Spencer Kantrowitz, ''Dramatic Allegory:Ane Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis'', University of Nebraska Press, 1975.  Greg Walker,'Sir David Lindsay's Ane Satire of the Thrie Estaitis,' ''Scottish Literary Journal'', 16.2 (Nov. 1989); Roderick Lyall, ''Ane Satyre of The Thrie Estaitis'', edited with an introduction and commentary, Canongate Classics 18, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter written by the Englishman [[William Eure, 1st Baron Eure|William Eure]] to [[Thomas Cromwell]] on 26 January 1540 gives a description of the interlude.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=76159 ''Letters &amp; Papers Henry VIII'', vol.15 (1894), no.114], link to British History Online, does not include synopsis&lt;/ref&gt; Eure, a Border Warden and Privy Councillor, had spoken to [[Thomas Bellenden of Auchnoule|Sir Thomas Bellenden]] at [[Coldstream]], who described the performance at [[Linlithgow Palace]] before James, his wife [[Mary of Guise]] and his bishops and council on the feast of the Epiphany. As the play turned on the Reformation of the church, Eure obtained a more detailed description from a Scottish contact who saw the play at Linlithgow, and enclosed in his letter the synopsis written by his spy .&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2zYIAQAAMAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Ellis, ed., ''Original Letters relative to British History'', series 3 vol.3 (1846)], pp.279-285&lt;/ref&gt; This description corresponds with the expanded later text of Lindsay's play. A king was shown with his courtiers, Placebo, Picthanke, and Flatterye. A Poor Man made his complaint, and was answered by a Burgess, a Man at Arms and a Bishop, who represented the three estates of the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. The Poor Man mentioned the real events of James V executing both [[Johnnie Armstrong|John Armstrong]] (of Staplegordon; in ballads the Laird o'[[Gilnockie Tower|Gilnockie]]), hanged in July 1530, and 'Sym the Laird,' who was hanged in February 1536.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Jamie, ''James V'', (1998), pp.77-83&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the poor man was described in the spy's synopsis;&lt;blockquote&gt;"After them come a poor Man, who did go up and down the scaffald, making a heavy complaint that he was harried (chased) through the Courtier's place, where through he hade strayled (lost) his house, his wife and children beggyng thair bread, and so of many thousand in Scotland, whiche would make the Kyng's Grace lose of men if his Grace stod neide (required), saying there was no remedy to be gotten, for though he would suite to the King's Grace, he was neither acquainted with Controller nor Treasurer, and without them might no man get no goodness of the King. And after, he spered (asked) for the King, and when he was shewed the Man that was King in the play, he answered and said he was no King, for there was but one King, which made all and governethe all, who is eternal, to whom he and all earthly Kings are but officers, of the which they must make reckoning. And so forth much more to that effect. And then he looked to the King, and said he was not the King of Scotland, for there was another King in Scotland that hanged John Armestrang with his fellowes, and Sym the Larde, and many other more, which had pacified the country, and stanched theft, but he had left one thing undone, which pertained as well to his charge as th'other. And when he was asked what that was, he made a long narration of the oppression of the poor, by the taking of the 'corse presaunte beists' (animals due as [[tithes]] at funerals), and of the harrying of poor men by [[Consistory court|Consistory law]], and of many other abussions of the spiritualitie and Churche, with many long stories and authorities."&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, ed., ''Original Letters relative to British History'', series 3 vol.3 (1846), 283-5 (here modernized)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eure said he had talked with Bellenden, a member of the council of [[James V of Scotland]] about the possibility of a [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation of the 'spirituality' in Scotland]]. The play at Linlithgow had shown the 'naughtiness' of the church. Bellenden said after the play the King spoke to the churchmen in the audience asking them to reform their factions and manner of living, otherwise he would send six of them into England to his uncle, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0dI_AAAAcAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Pinkerton, John, ''The History Of Scotland From The Accession Of The House Of Stuart To That Of Mary'', vol.2, (1791), pp.494-497]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Cupar Banns, 1552===
The performance at Cupar on 7 June 1552 was heralded by a short piece called the ''Cupar Banns'' announcing the play, presumably also written by Lindsay.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=86UlAAAAMAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s David Lyndsay's ''Cupar Banns'' in, John Pinkerton, ''Scottish Poems Reprinted From Scarce Editions'', vol.2 (1792)]&lt;/ref&gt; This has three sections of comic drama as a foretaste of the ''Satire''; the Cotter and his wife, Bessy and the Auld Man, and Fynlaw of the Foot Band, introduced by the 'Nuncius' and linked by the Fool. The characters of the three parts are supposed to be members of the ''Satire's'' audience. The ''Banns'' with some stage directions are found only in the ''Bannatyne Manuscript."&lt;ref&gt;Newlyn, Evelyn S., 'Traditions of Myth in The Cupar Banns', in, ''The European Sun'', Tuckwell (1993), pp.355-367&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edinburgh, 1554, and the Charteris synopsis===
Some preparations for the Edinburgh performance on Sunday 14 August 1554 were made by the Burgh Council. [[William MacDowall]] with six carpenters built a stage of boards, a seat for [[Mary of Guise]] and the French ambassador [[Henri Cleutin]], and a 'Convoy House', at the [[Calton Hill|Greenside playfield]], with the [[gallows|gallows, 'jebbettis,']] used in the final scene.&lt;ref&gt;Van Heijnsbergen, Theo, 'Literature in Queen Mary's Edinburgh: the Bannatyne Manuscript', in, ''The Renaissance in Scotland'', Brill (1994), p.206&lt;/ref&gt; The town council paid the wages of 12 minstrels, and after the play treated the actors to dinner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/edinburghrecord01edingoog#page/n150/mode/2up Adam, Robert, ed., ''Edinburgh Records: The Burgh Accounts'', vol.1 (1899), p.110]: ''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer'', vol.10 (1913), p.232:[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=58529 Marwick, ed., ''Extracts from the Records of the Burgh of Edinburgh, 1528-1557'', (1871), entries from 1554] via British History Online, (The other play event mentioned on 15 June 1554 was the entry of Guise as Regent)&lt;/ref&gt;

The printer Henry Charteris mentioned the Edinburgh performance in his introduction to Lindsay's ''Warkis'' (1568), saying how the clergy were surprised by the play and considered taking revenge. Charteris gave this summary of the ''Satire'';&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the play, playit beside Edinburgh, in the presence of the Quene Regent, and ane greit part of the nobilitie, with ane exceeding greit nowmber of pepill. lestand fra 9 houris afoir none till 6 houris at evin, quhair, amangis mony baith grave materis and merie trickis, he brocht in ane Bischop, ane Persone (Parson), ane Freir, and ane Nun, deckit up in their papisticall ornamentis and maner of raiment. And theirefter broicht in King Correction, quha reformand sindie deformities in his realme, passit to the tryall of the Clergie. And findand thame to be altogether Idiotis, unworthie of ony functioun ecclesiasticall, dicernit thame to be degradit of their dignateis, and spulzeit (deprived) of their offices, quhilk beand executit, thay war fund bot verray fulis, hypocrites, flatteris &amp; nouchtie persones."&lt;ref&gt;Hamer, Douglas, ''Works of David Lindsay'', vol.1, STS (1931), p.398&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Bannatyne Manuscript'' contains only selected "merry interludes" from the 1554 Greenside performance, the copyist George Bannatyne omitted the "grave matter" because the church had been reformed in reality in the 1560 [[Scottish Reformation Parliament]], and he noted, "the samyne abuse is weill reformit in Scotland." Stage directions in the ''Bannatyne Manuscript'' mention the settings of "houses", the "King's seat" and "palyeoun" tent, and props for the scene of the Poor Man and the [[Indulgence|Pardoner]], "Heir thay feight togeddir and the puir man sall cast doun the burd and cast the [[relic|rillickis]] in the watter."&lt;ref&gt;Tod Ritchie, W. ed., ''Banntyne Manuscript'', 4 vols., STS: ''Facsimile Bannatyne Manuscript'', NLS / Scolar Press (1980), f.182: Pinkerton, ed., ''Scottish Poems: the Bannatyne Interludes'', (1792), pp.23, 80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern performances==
The play's first complete modern production occurred on August 24, 1948, at the Edinburgh Festival with a modernised text by [[Robert Kemp (playwright)|Robert Kemp]] and directed by [[Tyrone Guthrie]], featuring [[Stanley Baxter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/sta/search/detaile.cfm?EID=9621 University of Glasgow Scottish Theatre Archive, 1948 production]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simon Callow]] and [[Fulton Mackay]] acted in a 1973 Edinburgh Festival production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/sta/search/detaile.cfm?EID=16770 University of Glasgow Scottish Theatre Archive, 1973 production]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Thrie Estaitis banner 1982.JPG|thumb|300p|New College, Edinburgh was the venue for the 1982 production]]

Mary McCluskey directed a performance by young people in July 1996 as part of Scottish Youth Theatre's Summer Festival. The script was translated into modern Scots by Fiona McGarry, and the play was performed in the round in The Cottier Theatre, Glasgow, with an original score.

[[John McGrath (playwright)|John McGrath]] adapted the play as a contemporary morality ''A Satire of the Four Estaites'', which was presented by [[Wildcat Theatre Company]] at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre as part of the [[Edinburgh International Festival]], also in 1996.&lt;ref name=mcgrath&gt;From the programme to the production.&lt;/ref&gt; This production opened on 16 August 1996 and starred [[Sylvester McCoy]].&lt;ref name=mcgrath/&gt;

The play was quoted at the opening of the new [[Scottish Parliament]], a mark illustrating its importance to modern Scots.

A new performance at Linlithgow Palace and [[Stirling Castle]] based on the story of the 1540 interlude took place in 2013 using a cast drawn from stage and screen.  In Linlithgow an open-air stage was erected on the Peel looking out across the loch for the performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/performing-arts/play-that-shook-king-returns-to-linlithgow-palace-1-2783441 ''Scotsman Newspaper'': Plans for 40-player presentation of the ''Satire'' at Linlithgow Peel, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The ''Satire'' is notable for being one of the earliest recorded instances of ''[[fuck]],'' predating any English language forms but preceded in the [[Scots language]] by the [[makar]] [[William Dunbar]] (Oxford English Dictionary entry.)

==Excerpt from the 1602 text==
A complete version of the play was printed in 1602, see external links for an edition of the text. In this extract Diligence meets the Pauper, who begins his complaint, including the practice of the parish priest claiming livestock at funerals which was mentioned in the 1540 interlude, (Lines 1954-2028);&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Fitzedward, ed., ''Ane Satire'', EETS, pp.459-252&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rodoljub Šabić.jpg|thumb|Rodoljub Šabić, Commissioner for Information and protection of personal data]]
'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Serbia]], access to public information is guaranteed in the Constitution and protected by the Law on free Access to Information of Public Importance adopted in 2003 and amended in 2007 and 2009. 
The '''scope of the right''' entails that everyone in Serbia has the right to access to information of public importance and to be informed whether public authorities hold specific information, whether such information is already accessible, and to obtain a copy of the requested information.&lt;ref name="Serbia Commissioner for Information"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poverenik.rs/en/contents-of-the-right.html| title= Contents of the right regarding access to information of public importance |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= 17 February 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Commissioner for Information of Public Importance and Protection of personal data is the authority entitled by law to monitor the respect of obligations entailed by this Law.

==Legal framework==
Serbia is considered among the countries with the best regulatory framework regarding access to information of public relevance: the Global Right to Information Rating, compiled by NGOs AccessInfo and Centre for Law and Democracy, ranks the country in the second position in its global ranking assessing the quality of legislative frameworks regulating FOI across the world.&lt;ref name="RTI Rating"&gt;{{cite web |date=2016 |title=Global Right to Information Rating |url=http://www.rti-rating.org/view_country/?country_name=Serbia |access-date= 17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right of access to public information is defined in Article 51 of the [[Constitution of Serbia]], which establishes the right of everybody to be informed about issues of public importance and the deriving obligation of state bodies and public organizations to guarantee the access to such information.&lt;ref name= "Serbian Constitution"&gt;{{cite constitution |article= 51 |section= II |country= Serbia |language= en |ratified=2006 |url=http://www.srbija.gov.rs/cinjenice_o_srbiji/ustav.php?change_lang=en |accessdate=17 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to access to information of public relevance is translated into national law by the Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance adopted in 2003 and amended in 2007 and 2009.&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poverenik.rs/en/pravni-okvir-pi/laws-pi/881-zakon-o-slobodnom-pristupu-informacijama-od-javnog-znacaja-preciscen-tekst-sl-glasnik-rs-12004-5407-10409-i-3610.html | title=Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance |access-date= 17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope of the law is valued positively especially inasmuch as it extends the right to access to information '''to all natural person''', notwithstanding their citizenship, temporary or permanent residence in the country.&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt;

Moreover, the right to access information applies to the executive, legislative and judicial bodies, State-owned enterprises, as well as other public authorities and private bodies that perform a public function or that receive significant public funding are also obliged to disclose information of public relevance (Art. 3).&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt;

Requests should be lodged in written form, with no need for the applicant to specify the reason for the request.&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt;
The public authority shall reply without delay and within 15 days at the latest. If the requested information entails consequences for the protection of a person's life or freedom, public health and the environment, the time span at the disposal of authorities is reduced to 48 hours.&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt; In cases in which the document contains information that the public has no legitimate interest to know, the applicant has the right to access to other parts of the documents.

Limitations to the right to access to information are defined in Article 9 of the Law, establishing that legitimate limitation may derive if the requested information exposes to risk the life, health, safety or another vital interest of a person; if it obstacles the work of the judiciary; if it threatens national defense, national and public safety, international relations or the government's ability to manage the national economic processes. Finally, classified information are excluded from the right.&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt;

The authority in charge of monitoring the respect of the Law is the '''Commissioner for Information of Public Importance'''. The Commissioner is an independent, second-level appeal instance: if a public authority does not respond to the request within the deadline, the applicant may lodge a complaint with the Commissioner, except in cases prescribed by this Law (Art.16).&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt;

The Commissioner is entitled by Law to issue decisions on disputed cases, and his/her decisions should be enforced by the Government of the Republic of Serbia if necessary (Art 28).&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt; The Commissioner is appointed by the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia on proposal of the Committee of the National Assembly responsible for information. The position of the Commissioner for Information has been held since 2004 by Rodoljub Šabić, who was appointed for an initial 7-years term and then re-elected in 2011.

Aside from examining individual complaints related to violations of the right to free access to information, the Commissioner also addresses citizens’ requests asking how to exercise their right to information, provides to state authorities opinions about the implementation of the law, trainings for law implementation and takes part in activities related to the EU accession process.

It has been noted that a significant '''limitation of the right''' set forth in the Constitution is due to the restrictions applied to the admissibility of complaints against first instance decisions: a complaint is not admissible if “lodged against decisions of the National Assembly, the President of the Republic, the Government of the Republic of Serbia, the Supreme Court of Serbia, the Constitutional Court and the Republic Public Prosecutor” (Art. 22).&lt;ref name="Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedominfo.org/2004/11/serbian-parliament-adopts-access-law/ FreedomInfo.org]{{Retrieved|access-date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==

Since the adoption of the Law on Access to Information in 2004, a significant increase in the number of requests has been registered by the entitled Commissioner, pointing to the positive fact that the right is increasing being used by citizens and media professionals in Serbia. At the same time, the increasing number of complaints filed to the Commissioner demonstrates the reluctancy by authorities to timely and fully comply with the obligation established by the Law on access to information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/Serbia/Serbia-the-hard-fight-for-information-177372 |title=Serbia: the hard fight for information |last=Maja|first=Poznatov |date=13 February 2017 |website=balcanicaucaso.org |publisher=Beta / Osservatorio Balcani Caucaso Transeuropa |access-date=24 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its annual report for 2015, the Commissioner for Information notes some limitation to the effective implementation of the law. These have to do, according to the Commissioner, particularly with insufficient accountability for violations of the Law and inefficient mechanisms of enforcement of the Commissioner’s decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poverenik.rs/images/stories/dokumentacija-nova/izvestajiPoverenika/2015/IZVESTAJ2015/engrezime.pdf |title= Summary of the report on the implementation of the law on Free Access to Information|last=Commissioner for Information in Serbia |date=2016 |access-date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the implementation of the Law on Access to Information in Serbia and its impact on the exercise of journalism, Freedom House has noted in 2016 that “Despite the existence of the 2004 Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance, authorities frequently obstruct journalists’ efforts to obtain public information”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2016/serbia |title= Freedom of the press in Serbia|last=Freedom House |date=2016 |access-date=19 February 2017|quote=“Despite the existence of the 2004 Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance, authorities frequently obstruct journalists’ efforts to obtain public information”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concern over implementation, alignment with European standards, endowment of resources to the Commissioner for Information and enforcement of his decisions is highlighted also by the [[European Union]] in its annual report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/pdf/key_documents/2016/20161109_report_serbia.pdf |title= EU Serbia Progress Report 2016| date=2016 |access-date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Youth Initiative for Human Rights v. Serbia===
A landmark case by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] related to the right to access to information in Serbia. 
In 2006, the Belgrade-based NGO [[Youth Initiative for Human Rights]] (YIHR) filed a request to the Serbian [[Security Intelligence Agency]] demanding information concerning the use of electronic surveillance measures by that agency in 2005. 
The Agency denied access to the requested information twice, first on grounds of secrecy and then, after a binding decision by the Commissioner for Information stating that the information should be made public, by declaring that it did not hold the requested information.&lt;ref name=Voohroof&gt;{{cite web| url=https://strasbourgobservers.com/2013/07/08/article-10-of-the-convention-includes-the-right-of-access-to-data-held-by-intelligence-agency/#more-2125 |title=Article 10 of the Convention includes the right of access to data held by an intelligence agency |last=Voorhoof |first=Dirk |date=8 July 2013 |website=Strasbourg Observer |access-date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

YIHR appealed to the European Court of Human Rights under [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 6]] and [[Article_10_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights|Article 10]] of the Convention.
In June 2013, the verdict of the ECtHR defined “unpersuasive” the argument used by the Agency according to which it did not hold the information requested and found that the restrictions imposed by the Serbian intelligence agency were not justified by domestic law and hence constituted a violation of article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.&lt;ref name=Voohroof/&gt;

The Fifth Chapter of the [[Vaisheshika Sutra]]s of [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kanada]] deals with the notion of action and the connected concept of effort; and also deals with the various special phenomenon of nature to the supersensible force, called '''Adrishta'''.

==Meaning==

The [[Sanskrit]] term, '''Adrishta''' ([[Sanskrit]]: अदृष्ट), as an adjective means - not seen, unseen, unobserved, unforeseen, unknown, invisible, unexpected, not experienced, destiny, fate, luck,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%83%E0%A4%B7%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9F&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; not permitted or sanctioned, illegal, virtue or vice as the eventual cause of pleasure or pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=Vaman Shivram Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|page=55|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.0.apte.637240}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hindu philosophy]] it refers to the unseen force, and the invisible results of works which accrue to a person; it refers to the Doctrine of [[Apurva]].

==Mimamsa concept==

Adrishta, literally meaning unseen, in the [[Mīmāṃsā|Mimamsa]] context refers to the invisible result of a ritual that accrues to a person, and in the [[Vaisheshika]] context, synonymous with [[Adharma]], to the equally invisible negative karmic accrual, as the unknown quality of things and of the soul, and brings about the cosmic order and arranges for soul according to their merits or demerits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Hinduism|author=Constance Jones|publisher=Infobase Publishing|pages=8–9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=adrishta&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lT0wEWy7ig&amp;sig=cazEv9VfyWuy32F4imKECrWlPBU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YG9bU9DgOIWnrAeczIGYDw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=adrishta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adrishta is all the elements which are not known and verified with the help of the five senses, and which can be realized through mind, intelligence and soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religious Basis of Hindu Beliefs|author=Bhojraj Dwivedi|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wmqKuHFWWgC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=adrishta&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IrKnuRnRCS&amp;sig=J9q02x_ebfpcLF43aOAc8DkBZLg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6m5bU9O0FcmUrge_soCABA&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=adrishta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each successive birth or incarnation and its possibilities are determined by the Adrishta and Samskara acquired in the previous incarnations – Adrishta and Samskara, without which the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] has never been, because its series of incarnations never began. Adrishta is Potential worth which must have been acquired in a human state to relate to a human state; it gives unity to the multiplicity and infinite variety of beings, and of the things under their control, it binds them into a single system and an organic whole. Prashasta hints that the existence of the Universe itself though not due to Brahma’s Adrishta is not free from Adrishta (Moral merit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Hindu Realism|author=Jagdisha Chandra Chaterji|publisher=Jain Publishing|pages=110, 115, 123, 172|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j6Ii6Fsb7gAC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=adrishta&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JNGcdtRHFZ&amp;sig=MxnCYFPi4huzMG845kpRZHwl41Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aGxbU7GDHMaQrQfwLA&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=adrishta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; All current actions and planned future actions get planted in Adrishta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Light on Relationships: The Synatry of Indian Astrology|author=Hart Defouw|publisher=Weiser Books|page=254|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQqP0LLIRR8C&amp;pg=PA254&amp;lpg=PA254&amp;dq=adrishta&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GX0N0wlo9_&amp;sig=XGCz068DwsqRfvuqu6nIqaowChc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mG5bU4Udgo-tB4f4gcAP&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=adrishta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vaisheshika concept==

The term Vaisheshika, appearing only once in Vaisheshika Sutra X.ii.7 and meaning characteristic or distinguishing, according to [[Pāṇini]] (Sutra IV.iii.87) is derived from the word Vishesha meaning species, distinction, difference, excellence or superiority. Uluka, who was before the birth of [[Gautama Buddha]] and is commonly known as [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kanada]], compiled the Vaisheshika sutras. Gautama who founded the [[Nyaya]] School came later. The term Adrishta appears in Vaisheshika Sutra V.i.15:

: मणिगमनं सूच्यभिसर्पणमदृष्टकारणकम् |

: "The movement of the jewel (and) the approach of the needle, (both) have adrishtam (the invisible consequences of previous acts) as their cause."

The reason of the movement of the jewel is not a particular volition but the efficient cause is the merit of the former possessor or the demerit of the thief. The non-combative cause is its conjunction with soul possessing adrishta (or results of actions in previous states of existence) and the combinative cause is the jewel. Adrishta is also the cause of attraction of the needle towards a loadstone (magnet). Owing to adrishta is the upwards flaming of fire, the sideward motion of air and the actions of atoms at the beginning of creation. Kanada, later on, tells us that even action in earth results from impulse, impact, and conjunction with the conjunct and is caused by Adrishta (Vaisheshika Sutra V.ii.1-2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sacred Books of the Hindus Vol.VI - The Vaisheshika Sutras of Kanada 1923 Ed.|publisher=Sudhindra Nath Basu|pages=157–161|url=https://archive.org/details/thevaiasesikasut00kanauoft }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The fruits or rewards of [[yajna]]s or sacrifice are not dispensed by any beneficent God. [[Apurva]] bestows the reward on the sacrificer. Apurva is the essential link between work and its result; it is a positive and unseen force created by an act that leads to the attainment of the fruit of action. This is the view of [[Jaimini]] though not implicitly mentioned by him but accepted by [[Prabhākara|Prabhakara]] and [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa|Kumarila]] as one the fundamental tenets of their respective schools. Later on, it came to be said that Apurva is the function of God. Kumarila insists that fruits of [[karma]]s accrue in this very life and not in some future life. Bharat Mitra, who lived long before [[Śābara|Sabara]] who lived long before Kumarila, does not accept Apurva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bhartrmitra|publisher=Vishal Agarwal|url=http://vishalagarwal.bharatvani.org/articles/acharyas/bhartrmitra/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Patanjali]] tells us –

: क्लेशमूलः कर्माशयो दृष्टादृष्टजन्मवेदनीयः ([[Yoga Sutras]] II.12)

Apurva is an epistemic mechanism that indicates knowledge of causal links between acts and their consequences. Sabara discusses this concept in his commentary on the Vaisheshika Sutras, and even claims that by the word ''codana'' ([[Sanskrit]]: चोदन -meaning precept or rule -the performative element of an injunction) [[Jaimini]] really meant Apurva; it is mentioned by Jaimini in passing, as part of purvapaksha argument in Mimamasa Sutra I.ii.9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Scripture and Knowledge: An Essay on Religious Epistemology|author=Shlomo Biderman|publisher=BRILL|pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iag4ian2gf0C&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213&amp;dq=apurva+jaimini+sutras&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OKJscyxm7C&amp;sig=XozsecUlzBCE0NsTrIdo0hrJOOM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4bhbU_u3O8OArgeNpIFw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=apurva%20jaimini%20sutras&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

The early Mimamsakas believed in an adrishta that was the result of performing [[karma]]s and saw no need for an [[Ishvara]] in their system. However, the Atomic Theory which teaches that the world is produced by the successive formation of compounds due to the aggregation of atoms resulting from the motion of atoms, the primary motion brought about by the unseen the Adrishta residing in the primary atoms and residing in the individual souls is rejected by the followers of the [[Vedanta]] (Uttara Mimamsa) schools:
: उभयथापि न कर्मातस्तदभावः | ([[Brahma Sutras]] II.ii.12)
"In either case (viz the Adrishta, the unseen principle, inhering either in the atoms or in the soul) the activity (of the atoms) is not (possible), therefore the negation of that (viz of creation through the combination of atoms)."

The Nyaya-Vaisheshika systems of philosophy derive the conception of [[moksha]] from the [[Upanishads]] but require a highly developed stage of logical thought, and care more for the instrument of knowledge than for knowledge itself. The Mimamsa system by the very nature of its ritualistic problems does not have much in common with Upanishadic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya vidya Bhavan|pages=139–140|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33205">'''Archaeological looting in Iraq''' took place on the aftermath of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|US-led invasion of Iraq]] in 2003. The chaos following war has provided the opportunity to pillage everything that is not nailed down.  The period between April 8, 2003 when the staff vacated [[National Museum of Iraq]] and April 16, 2003 when US forces arrived in sufficient numbers to “restore some semblance of order.” Some 15,000 cultural artifacts disappeared in that time.

==History==
Looting of ancient artifacts has a long tradition. As early as 1884, laws passed in Mesopotamia about moving and destroying antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of WW1, British-occupied Mesopotamia had created protections for archeological sites where looting was beginning to become a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They established an absolute prohibition on exporting antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The British Museum was responsible for the sites and museums across Iraq during this time period. [[Gertrude Bell]], well known for drawing the Iraq borders, excavated many sites around Iraq and created what is now the [[National Museum of Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

By the mid 1920s the black market for antiquities was growing and looting began in all sites where antiquities could be found. After Iraq was independent of Britain the absolute ban on antiquity exports was lifted. Until the mid 1970s Iraq was one of very few countries to not prohibit external trade in antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made Iraq attractive to looters and black market collectors from around the globe. The result of the first [[Gulf War]] was that at least 4000 artifacts were looted from Iraq sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Uprisings that followed the war also resulted in 9 of 13 regional museums being looted and burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was just a preview for what would once again happen after the 2003 war. Since the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], archaeological looting has become an even greater problem. Though some sites, such as [[Ur]] and [[Nippur]], were officially protected by US and Coalition forces, most were not. 

[[Saddam Hussein]] treasured his national heritage immensely and acted to defend these sites and the artifacts within them. Hussein came into power in 1979 as the fifth president of Iraq. He believed that the past of Iraq was important to his national campaign and his regime actually doubled the national budget for archeology and heritage creating museums and protecting sites all over Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn’t until his party the [[Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-dominated faction)|Ba'ath Party]] was under pressure in the 1990s that looting become a large problem once again for Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000 looting had become so rampant that the workers of the sites were even looting their own workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the fall of Saddam's government on 9 April 2003, archaeological sites were left completely open to looting.

==Failure to protect before the 2003 Invasion ==

Before the 2003 invasion by US and Coalition forces, the US government created a post-war plan for Iraq. The US has been heavily criticized in the media and academic writings for not adequately planning protections for culture and antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lawrence Rothfield, former director of the Cultural Policy Center at the [[University of Chicago]] and associate professor of English and comparative literature, this looting of the National Museum of Iraq and of hundreds of archaeological sites around the country was not prevented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of war planning it was Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] who decided on a fast invasion with fewer troops, resulting in inadequate protection of buildings and cultural sites.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} 

American troops and commanders did not prioritize security for cultural sites around Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peacekeeping was seen as a lesser job than physically fighting in combat and President Bush’s suspension of former president Clinton’s policies for peacekeeping not only backed up this thought but also made the US’s duties to restore public order unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; American troops in Iraq didn’t trust Iraqi power of any kind meaning that instead of using and training Iraqi police, the US military took matters of security and policing into their own hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially the US would act as peacekeepers to train a national army and police force. Special Forces teams would work with regional warlords to keep control of their territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allowing warlords to police their own areas has been credited with being a disastrous plan for the archaeological sites in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Arthur Houghton had an interest and some expertise in cultural heritage and was one of the first to wonder what the pre-war plan was for Iraqi culture. He had worked in the State Department as a Foreign Service officer, as an international policy analyst for the White house and also served at an acting curator for the Getty Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In late spring 2002, Houghton was approached by Ashton Hawkins, former Executive Vice President and Counsel to the Trustees of the Metropolitan Museum, and was asked to find out what was being done by officials to secure heritage sites in the upcoming war in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houghton could find no one designated with the task of protection and preservation of culture in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There had been a secret Future of Iraq Project since October 2001, with clearance from the Pentagon. However, even under this Project no specific person had taken up responsibility of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even archaeological organizations in the US hadn’t noticed the issue until late 2002. Likewise when the US Agency for Cultural Development (USAID) met with estimated 150 NGO’s not one brought up protection of cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] had in fact, after the Gulf War in 1991, attempted to go into Iraq and assess the damage to cultural sites but they were not allowed to enter the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO then focused, for the next decade, on reconstruction after the fact rather than prevention measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the US military, Civil Affairs (CA) forces were important to the protection of culture and, as they were mostly reservists, included experts in a variety of areas including archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was to spread the expertise among fighting forces in order to warn them of cultural sites in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, CA was left out of  pre-war planning until January 2003, when it was too late to be of any real significant help. The CA had to prioritize the small amount of CA troops to what they thought was necessary, which inevitably wasn’t culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CA did, however, pull the only two archaeologists in Civil Affairs to be on a culture team, Maj. Chris Varhola and Capt. William Sumner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These two men, however, in the end were sent to other places when the conflict began. Varhola was needed to prepare for the refugee crises that never arrived and Sumner was reassigned to guard a zoo after pushing his advisor too hard on antiquities issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any protection of culture, sites or buildings was stopped due to the priorities of other matters. Essentially no one who had archaeological expertise was senior enough to get anything done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another branch of the US government that had interest in culture was the Foreign Area Offices (FAO). Unfortunately though, they were focused on customs and attitudes rather than archaeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Something that was accomplished was the creation of a no-strike list created by Maj. Varhola just like two archaeologists before him had done during the 1991 Gulf War which had a great outcome of saving antiquities from bombing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One piece of international law that is important for this conflict is the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, this Convention states that parties in conflict must “under take to prohibit, prevent and, if necessary, put a stop to any form of theft, pillage or misappropriation of, and any act of vandalism directed against, cultural property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;” This provision was constructed for the parties actually in combat within the war and not civilians within their own state. As the upcoming years would prove, there are exceptions to this Convention and they would result in Americans firing on the Iraq National Museum. 

By fall 2002, post-war planning was sporadic and improvised. The cultural planning aspect needed to have leadership that it never got.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deputy Assistant under the Security of Defense, Joseph Collins, recalls some forces spent more time working on projects that ended up not being needed like a refugee crises plan. He says he can’t remember if there was even an organizational plans to solve specific issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first known effort by cultural interests to contact US officials was October 2002. After a meeting of powerful players in culture, Houghton sent a letter asking for departments to tell forces to avoid damaging monuments, soldiers were to respect the integrity of sites, and lastly to work quickly to get the antiquities services in Iraq up and running again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, the [[Archaeological Institute of America]] (AIA) also sent a similar letter to the Pentagon in December 2002 asking for governments to take action to prevent looting in the aftermath of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; As 2002 came to an end the media and government were only broadcasting the good done by the troops in not destroying cultural heritage themselves but not on the looting done by people in Iraq and the Americans duty to protect the antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Large scale looting ==

When the looting of the National Iraq Museum became known, experts from around the globe started planning to remedy the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGuire Gibson, one of the leading archaeologists and experts on Mesopotamia explained to the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) that the looted museum artifacts were only a small part of what archaeological digs around the country held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps 25 thousand of an estimated half million sites were registered. ORHA had no resources to address this problem. Gibson had suggested helicopter surveys to determine the scale of looted sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 24, 2003, looting had taken place in [[Umma]], Umm al-Hafriyat, Umm al-Aqarib, Bismaya, Larsa, and Bad-tibira, most of were unguarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most looting was by workers once employed by the now disbanded State Board of Antiquities and Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local tribe was guarding the World Heritage Site of Hatra although others were unsupervised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By May 2003, international work began on the already looted museum but not on other sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US military conducted a raid in May on Umma where they found hundreds of trenches with many looters all over the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 7, the Bush Administration replaced Gen. Jay Garner with L. Paul Bremer who was given more power and banned high-ranking Ba’ath Party members from government jobs and disbanded the remains of the Iraqi army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any guards at archeological sites were unpaid for months and they were not allowed to carry guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, instead of dealing with civilian looters, these unarmed guards were dealing with large mobs of armed people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

At the end of May 2003, it finally became clear how badly the sites were looted when a trip sponsored by National Geographic went out to assess the damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a northern and southern team to assess the post-conflict damage by land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found the famous sites such as Babylon, Hatra, Nimrud and Ur were under US military control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lesser known sites were completely unguarded and the responsible Civil Affairs teams didn’t even know where they were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every place the National Geographic team saw, except one that was guarded by barbed wire, had been damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gibson was part of the northern National Geographic team and he sent  a report to the White House science advisor John Marburger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other archeological experts in both the US and Britain were waiting for invitations to go to Iraq and help. After Gibson’s report they were given invitations to create a team in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Early July 2003, UNESCO revealed that looting was still happening at sites across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other military services such as Japanese and Dutch troops offered assistance but were ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 8, a new security guard force known as the Iraqi Facility Protection Service (FPS) was established to protect sites all around the country in co-operation with the US military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, the State Department announced it was forming a group to assist in the rebuilding of Iraq’s cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

These announcements had no effect on the looting and illegal export of artifacts. McGuire Gibson on September 11, 2003 wrote  to a military geographer, "The continuing destruction of sites all over southern Iraq and the theft of thousands of artifacts every week, with no visible effort on part of the US authorities, makes the question of ethical behaviour by museums pointless. Your unit of the Pentagon is capable of demonstrating the location and expansion of illegal digging. Are you at least doing that much?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

[[File:Hrs 081225 sod hia.jpg|left|thumb|Recovered artifacts on display in late 2008]]

It is impossible to discover exactly how much destruction to archeological sites has happened since the 2003 invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 2004, US military maps still did not show archeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archeologist Elizabeth Stone purchased satellite images of the seven thousand square kilometers in Iraq that contain many known sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; She counted 1,837 new holes by comparing 2001-2002 with 2003 images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looters concentrated on sites that had the most marketable artifacts. Estimates of the number of looted artifacts from 2003-2005 are from 400,000 to 600,000 items. This number is 30-40 times greater than the number of artifacts stolen from the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Britain alone between 2004-2006 seized 3-4 tons of plundered artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some artifacts have been recovered by accident. An archeologist was watching a home decorating show when he saw a second century stone head from Hatra sitting on the decorator’s mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The illegal black market for goods became so saturated that prices in the market were  going down after 2003 according to an antiquities researcher specializing in illicit dealings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Revenue from looted antiquities is estimated by the Archeological Institute of America to amount to between $10 to $20 million annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrorist and rebel groups have a long history of using stolen artifacts to finance their operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the end of 2003, 1,900 Iraqi antiquities had been confiscated from bordering countries: 1,450 in Jordan, 36 in Syria, 38 in Kuwait and 18 in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Marine Corps reservist Matthew Boulay witnessed illicit trading even on U.S. military bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flea markets authorized by the camp commanders included a booth with antiquities for $20, $40 or $100 each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boulay asked Gibson and was told that these artifacts were real. Gibson asked Boulay to ask the base commander to stop these sales. When Boulay informed his platoon commander he got a “cease and desist” order forbidding any more emails about the issue to anyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other institutes from America and around the world have contributed to protect sites in Iraq but this is still not enough. The US started teaching military personnel headed for Iraq the importance of cultural heritage and site preservation, but not how to stop civilian looting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donny George who was an employee at the Iraq National Museum was appointed to Director of Museums in 2004, and by summer 2006, a force of 1,400 guards were situated at sites around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothfield|first1=Lawrence|title=The Rape of Mesopotamia|date=2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sites affected==

*[[Adab (city)|Adab]] – an ancient city plagued by hundreds of looters.
* [[Babylon]] – saw the construction of "a 150-hectare camp for 2,000 troops. In the process the 2,500-year-old brick pavement to the [[Ishtar Gate]] was smashed by tanks and the gate itself damaged. The archaeology-rich subsoil was bulldozed to fill sandbags, and large areas covered in compacted gravel for helipads and car parks. Babylon is being rendered archaeologically barren".&lt;ref&gt;([[Simon Jenkins]] in [[The Guardian]], 8 June 2007).[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,2098272,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hatra]] – looters with stonecutters have stolen elements of friezes and reliefs straight off the ancient architecture here.
* [[Isin]] – over two hundred looters' pits are organized around the former site of the Temple of [[Nintinugga|Gula]]; countless artifacts have been removed from the site here, including innumerable [[cuneiform]] tablets, [[cylinder seal]]s, and [[Votive deposit|votive tablets]], some of which could sell for as much as $30,000.
* [[Nimrud]] – home of the palace of [[Assurnasirpal II]] and described by the [[Old Testament]] as the "principal city" of [[Assyria]], Nimrud is one of the few sites that is militarily protected. However, weeks before the arrival of the site's US guards, looters attacked the friezes and statues with stonecutting tools, stealing images distinctly belonging to Nimrud, and thus unmistakenly known to any potential buyers to be stolen; the items have been sold, presumably, nevertheless. Those few looters that managed to break into this site despite its protection have given every indication that they know precisely what they are looking for, where to find it, and how to get at it. Like many looters throughout Iraq and across the world, they have presumably been hired to obtain specific images; this separates them from the looters who dig up and sell whatever they can find.
* [[Nineveh]] – one of the more thoroughly researched sites, experts have little difficulty identifying objects stolen from Nineveh. The site was severely looted and damaged nevertheless after the first Gulf War, and chunks of its unique and ancient friezes have appeared on the European and American art markets.
* [[Nippur]] – the great [[ziggurat]] here has only three major looters' pits cut into it, which are the first in over forty years of valuable research and excavation.
* [[Umma]] – looters descended upon the site as soon as Coalition bombing began; the site is now pockmarked with hundreds of ditches and pits. When archaeologists "tried to remove vulnerable carvings from the ancient city of Umma to Baghdad, they found gangs of looters already in place with bulldozers, dump trucks and AK47s".[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,2098272,00.html]
* [[Ur]] – one of the few sites protected by a US military presence. According to [[Simon Jenkins]], "its walls are pockmarked with wartime shrapnel and a blockhouse is being built over an adjacent archaeological site".[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,2098272,00.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11913">{{about|authority as a concept of political philosophy||}}

'''Authority''' is the [[Legitimacy (political)|right]] to exercise [[Power (social and political)|power]], which can be formalized by a [[State (polity)|state]] and exercised by way of judges, appointed executives of government, or the ecclesiastical or priestly appointed representatives of a God or other [[deity|deities]]. 

A governing body may be labelled an authority e.g. the [[Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority]] or the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]]. ''Authority'' can also mean the right to complete an action or execute an order.

In [[government]], ''authority'' is often used interchangeably with ''power''. However, their meanings differ: while ''power'' is the ability to order or accomplish a goal or to influence others, ''authority'' refers to a claim of [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]], the justification and right to exercise that power. For example, while a [[Crowd|mob]] may have the power to punish a criminal by beating or [[lynching]], the [[rule of law]] indicates that only a [[court]] of law has the authority to determine and refer a criminal for punishment. In this sense, authority is a matter of not only the ability or power to [[Decision-making|make decisions]], but the right to make these decisions and execute them with commensurate power. Appropriate authority is the basis of good government in the [[Republicanism|republican]] conception of government, which finds much of its theoretical origins in [[ancient Rome]].

== History ==
[[Ancient history|Ancient]] understandings of authority trace back to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and draw later from Catholic ([[Thomism|Thomistic]]) thought and other [[Tradition|traditional]] understandings. In more modern terms, forms of authority include transitional authority exhibited in for example [[Cambodia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC)|last=Widyono|first=Benny|date=Oct 2014|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; public authority in the form of [[Popular Power|popular power]], and, in more administrative terms, bureaucratic or managerial techniques. In terms of bureaucratic governance, one limitation of the governmental agents of the executive branch, as outlined by George A. Krause, is that they are not as close to the popular will as elected representatives are.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Legislative Delegation of Authority to Bureaucratic Agencies|last=Krause|first=George A.|date=2010|work=The Oxford Handbook of American Bureaucracy|access-date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|editor-last=Durant|editor-first=Robert F.|location=New York, NY|page=524}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claims of authority can extend to national or individual [[sovereignty]], which is broadly or provisionally understood as a claim to political authority that is [[Legitimation|legitimated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Sovereignty|last=Glanville|first=Luke|date=|work=The Oxford Handbook of the Responsibility to Protect|access-date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|editor-last=Bellamy|editor-first=Alex J.|location=New York, NY|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historical applications of authority in political terms include the formation of the city-state of [[Geneva]], and experimental treatises involving the topic of authority in relation to education include ''[[Emile, or On Education|Emile]]'' by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. As David Laitin defines, authority is a key concept to be defined in determining the range and role of political theory, science and inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laitin|first=David|date=1998|title=Toward a Political Science Discipline: Authority Patterns Revisited|url=|journal=Comparative Political Studies|volume=31|issue=4|pages=423-443|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relevance of a grounded understanding of authority includes the basic foundation and formation of political, civil and/or ecclesiastical institutions or representatives. In recent years, however, authority in political contexts has been challenged or questioned.

== Political philosophy ==
There have been several contributions to the debate of [[political authority]]. Among others, [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Alexandre Kojève]] and [[Carl Schmitt]] have provided some of the most remarkable texts.

In [[political philosophy]], the jurisdiction of political authority, the location of [[sovereignty]], the balancing of freedom and authority,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hegel on Freedom and Authority|last=Cristi|first=Renato|publisher=University of Wales Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=Cardiff, Wales|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the requirements of political obligations have been core questions from the time of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] to the present. Most [[democracy|democratic]] societies are engaged in an ongoing discussion regarding the legitimate extent of the exercise of [[government]]al authority. In the [[United States]], for instance, there is a prevailing belief that the political system as instituted by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] should accord the populace as much freedom as reasonable, and that government should limit its authority accordingly, known as [[limited government]].

In the discussion regarding the legitimacy of political authority, there are two beliefs at the respective ends of the spectrum. The first is the belief in the absolute freedom of the individual, otherwise known as [[Philosophical anarchism|political anarchism]]. The second is the belief that there must be a central authority in the form of a sovereign that claims ownership and control over the masses. This belief is known as [[statism]]. Sovereignty, in modern terms, can refer either to the adherence to a form of sovereign rule or the individual sovereignty, or autonomy, of a nation-state. The argument for political anarchy and anti-statism is made by [[Michael Huemer]] in his book ''[[The Problem of Political Authority]]''. On the other side, one of the main arguments for the legitimacy of the state is some form of the “[[Social contract|social contract theory]]” developed by [[Thomas Hobbes]] in his 1668 book, [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|''Leviathan'']], or by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in his political writings on [[The Social Contract|the social contract]]. 

== Sociology ==
Since the emergence of the [[social sciences]], authority has become a subject of research in a variety of [[empirical]] settings: the family (parental authority), small groups (informal authority of [[leadership]]), intermediate organizations such as schools, churches, armies, industries and bureaucracies (organizational and bureaucratic authorities), and society-wide or inclusive organizations, ranging from the most primitive tribal society to the modern nation-state and intermediate organization (political authority).

The definition of authority in contemporary social science remains a matter of debate. [[Max Weber]] in his essay "[[Politics as a Vocation]]" (1919) divided legitimate authority into [[Authority (sociology)|three types]]. Others, like [[Howard Bloom]], suggest a parallel between authority and [[Veneration of the dead|respect/reverence for ancestors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== The United States ==
The understanding of political authority and the exercise of [[Political power in the United States over time|political powers]] in the American context traces back to the writings of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], including the arguments put forward in ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' by [[James Madison]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and the First Chief Justice of the United States [[John Jay]], and later speeches by the 16th President of the United States [[Abraham Lincoln]]. "Our government rests in public opinion," President Abraham Lincoln said in 1856 Related to the Authority of the Sanatana Kingdom .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lincoln Speeches|last=Guelzo|first=Allen C.|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1854 Speech at Peoria, Illinois, Lincoln espoused "the proposition that each man should do precisely as he pleases with all which is exclusively his own," a principle existing "at the foundation of the sense of justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lincoln Speeches|last=Guelzo|first=Allen C.|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sense of personal ownership and stewardship was integral to the practice of [[Limited government|self-government]] as Abraham Lincoln saw it by a [[Republicanism|Republican]] nation and its people. This was because, as Abraham Lincoln also declared, "No man is good enough to govern another man, without that other's consent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lincoln Speeches|last=Guelzo|first=Allen C.|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carbon Process Management (CPM)''' is a management process which promotes environmental effectiveness in organizations. It is designed to maximize efficiencies in the consumption of resources that contribute to climate change. When implemented effectively, CPM techniques can reduce operating costs, realizing gains in [[brand equity]], competitive advantage and stakeholder value. Initially introduced by [[First Carbon Solutions]], CPM uses [[Kaizen|Japanese kaizen]] philosophy which continuously improves workplace practices to reduce wastage, this is combined [[Business process management|business process management (BPM)]] which increases efficiency. Governments who resorts to legal mechanisms and regulation to deal with the risks of climate change, techniques such as CPM are directed towards a corporate approach in helping reduce [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas emissions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Carbon management and sustainability  | url=http://www.firstcarbonsolutions.com/ | work= First Carbon Solutions | accessdate=2010-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Outsourcing 2010: Green growth, public sector deals and rise of the SME |url=http://www.silicon.com/technology/it-services/2010/01/12/outsourcing-2010-green-growth-public-sector-deals-and-rise-of-the-sme-39745317/ |work=Silicon, a CBS Interactive Limited |accessdate=2010-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323065152/http://www.silicon.com/technology/it-services/2010/01/12/outsourcing-2010-green-growth-public-sector-deals-and-rise-of-the-sme-39745317/ |archivedate=2010-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Going green |url=http://www.bworldonline.com/main/content.php?id=5871 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221516/http://www.bworldonline.com/main/content.php?id=5871 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-09-23 |work=Business World Online |accessdate=2010-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= What is your carbon footprint?  | url= http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=551149&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=85 | work=Philippine Star | accessdate=2010-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Causality''' (also referred to as '''causation''',&lt;ref&gt;'The action of causing; the relation of cause and effect' [[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''cause and effect''') is what connects one process (the ''cause'') with another process or state (the ''[[Result|effect]]''),{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} where the first is partly responsible for the second, and the second is partly dependent on the first. In general, a process has many causes,&lt;ref&gt;

 | quote = Multiple causation has been defended, and even taken for granted, by the most diverse thinkers [...]  simple causation is suspected of artificiality on account of its very simplicity. Granted, the assignment of a single cause (or effect) to a set of effects (or causes) may be a superficial, nonilluminating hypothesis. But so is usually the hypothesis of simple causation. Why should we remain satisfied with statements of causation, instead of attempting to go beyond the first simple relation that is found?

which are said to be causal [[factor (disambiguation)|factor]]s for it, and all lie in its [[past]] (more precise: none lie in its future). An effect can in turn be a cause of, or causal factor for, many other effects, which all lie in its [[future]]. Causality is [[metaphysics|metaphysically]] prior to notions of [[time and space]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Robb|Robb, A.A.]] (1911). ''Optical Geometry of Motion'', W.

[[Aristotelian philosophy]] uses the word "cause" to mean "explanation" or "answer to a why question", including [[Aristotle]]'s material, formal, efficient, and final "causes"; then the "cause" is the [[Explanandum|explanans]] for the [[explanandum]]. In this case, failure to recognize that different kinds of "cause" are being considered can lead to futile debate. Of [[Four causes|Aristotle's four explanatory modes]], the one nearest to the concerns of the present article is the "efficient" one.

The topic of causality remains a staple in [[contemporary philosophy]].

==Concept==

===Metaphysics===
The nature of cause and effect is a concern of the subject known as [[metaphysics]].

====Ontology====
A general metaphysical question about cause and effect is what kind of [[entity]] can be a cause, and what kind of entity can be an effect.

One viewpoint on this question is that cause and effect are of one and the same kind of entity, with causality an asymmetric relation between them. That is to say, it would make good sense grammatically to say either "''A'' is the cause and ''B'' the effect" or "''B'' is the cause and ''A'' the effect", though only one of those two can be actually true. In this view, one opinion, proposed as a metaphysical principle in [[process philosophy]], is that every cause and every effect is respectively some process, event, becoming, or happening.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead, A.N.]] (1929). ''Process and Reality. An Essay in Cosmology. Gifford Lectures Delivered in the University of Edinburgh During the Session 1927–1928'', Macmillan, New York, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK.&lt;/ref&gt; An example is 'his tripping over the step was the cause, and his breaking his ankle the effect'. Another view is that causes and effects are 'states of affairs', with the exact natures of those entities being less restrictively defined than in process philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Malet Armstrong|Armstrong, D.M.]] (1997). ''A World of States of Affairs'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|0-521-58064-1}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;89, 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another viewpoint on the question is the more classical one, that a cause and its effect can be of different kinds of entity. For example, in Aristotle's efficient causal explanation, an action can be a cause while an [[enduring]] object is its effect. For example, the generative actions of his parents can be regarded as the efficient cause, with Socrates being the effect, Socrates being regarded as an enduring object, in philosophical tradition called a 'substance', as distinct from an action.

====Epistemology====
Since causality is a subtle metaphysical notion, considerable effort is needed to establish knowledge of it in particular empirical circumstances.

====Geometrical significance====
Causality has the properties of antecedence and contiguity.&lt;ref name="Born"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sklar"/&gt; These are topological, and are ingredients for space-time geometry. As developed by [[Alfred Robb]], these properties allow the derivation of the notions of time and space.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Robb|Robb, A.A.]] (1936). [https://archive.org/details/geometryoftimean032218mbp ''Geometry of Time and Space''], Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Jammer]] writes "the Einstein postulate ... opens the way to a straightforward construction of the causal topology ... of Minkowski space."&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Jammer|Jammer, M.]] (1982). 'Einstein and quantum physics', pp. 59–76 in ''Albert Einstein: Historical and Cultural Perspectives; the Centennial Symposium in Jerusalem'', edited by G. Holton, Y. Elkana, Princeton University Press, Princeton NJ, {{ISBN|0-691-08299-5}}, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Causal efficacy propagates no faster than light.&lt;ref&gt;Naber, G.L. (1992). ''The Geometry of Minkowski Spacetime: An Introduction to the Mathematics of the Special Theory of Relativity'', Springer, New York, {{ISBN|978-1-4419-7837-0}}, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the notion of causality is metaphysically prior to the notions of time and space. In practical terms, this is because use of the relation of causality is necessary for the interpretation of empirical experiments. Interpretation of experiments is needed to establish the physical and geometrical notions of time and space.

===Necessary and sufficient causes===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Causes of schizophrenia]] --&gt;
{{hatnote|A similar concept occurs in logic, for this see [[Necessary and sufficient conditions]]}}

Causes may sometimes be distinguished into two types: necessary and sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;Epp, Susanna S.: "Discrete Mathematics with Applications, Third Edition", pp. 25–26. Brooks/Cole – Thomson Learning, 2004. {{ISBN|0-534-35945-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third type of causation, which requires neither necessity nor sufficiency in and of itself, but which contributes to the effect, is called a "contributory cause."

;Necessary causes: If ''x'' is a necessary cause of ''y'', then the presence of ''y'' necessarily implies the prior occurrence of ''x''. The presence of ''x'', however, does not imply that ''y'' will occur.&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Sufficient causes: If ''x'' is a sufficient cause of ''y'', then the presence of ''x'' necessarily implies the subsequent occurrence of ''y''. However, another cause ''z'' may alternatively cause ''y''. Thus the presence of ''y'' does not imply the prior occurrence of ''x''.&lt;ref name="CR"/&gt;
;Contributory causes: For some specific effect, in a singular case, a factor that is a contributory cause is one among several co-occurrent causes. It is implicit that all of them are contributory. For the specific effect, in general, there is no implication that a contributory cause is necessary, though it may be so. In general, a factor that is a contributory cause is not sufficient, because it is by definition accompanied by other causes, which would not count as causes if it were sufficient. For the specific effect, a factor that is on some occasions a contributory cause might on some other occasions be sufficient, but on those other occasions it would not be merely contributory.&lt;ref name="Riegelman"&gt;{{Cite journal

[[J. L. Mackie]] argues that usual talk of "cause" in fact refers to '''INUS''' conditions ('''i'''nsufficient but '''n'''on-redundant parts of a condition which is itself '''u'''nnecessary but '''s'''ufficient for the occurrence of the effect).&lt;ref name="Mackie"&gt;Mackie, John L. The Cement of the Universe: A study in Causation. Clarendon Press, Oxford, England, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; An example is a short circuit as a cause for a house burning down. Consider the collection of events: the short circuit, the proximity of flammable material, and the absence of firefighters. Together these are unnecessary but sufficient to the house's burning down (since many other collections of events certainly could have led to the house burning down, for example shooting the house with a flamethrower in the presence of oxygen and so forth). Within this collection, the short circuit is an insufficient (since the short circuit by itself would not have caused the fire) but non-redundant (because the fire would not have happened without it, everything else being equal) part of a condition which is itself unnecessary but sufficient for the occurrence of the effect. So, the short circuit is an INUS condition for the occurrence of the house burning down.

===Contrasted with conditionals===
{{more citations needed|section|reason=Want to read more, want to examine source|date=January 2017}} 
[[Indicative conditional|Conditional]] statements are ''not'' statements of causality. An important distinction is that statements of causality require the antecedent to precede or coincide with the consequent in time, whereas conditional statements do not require this temporal order. Confusion commonly arises since many different statements in English may be presented using "If ..., then ..." form (and, arguably, because this form is far more commonly used to make a statement of causality). The two types of statements are distinct, however.

For example, all of the following statements are true when interpreting "If ..., then ..." as the material conditional:

# ''If Barack Obama is president of the United States in 2011, then Germany is in Europe.''
# ''If George Washington is president of the United States in 2011, then &lt;arbitrary statement&gt;.''

The first is true since both the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and the [[consequent]] are true. The second is true in [[sentential logic]] and indeterminate in natural language, regardless of the consequent statement that follows, because the antecedent is false.

The ordinary [[indicative conditional]] has somewhat more structure than the material conditional. For instance, although the first is the closest, neither of the preceding two statements seems true as an ordinary indicative reading. But the sentence:

* ''If Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon did not write Macbeth, then someone else did.''
intuitively seems to be true, even though there is no straightforward causal relation in this hypothetical situation between Shakespeare's not writing Macbeth and someone else's actually writing it.

Another sort of conditional, the [[counterfactual conditional]], has a stronger connection with causality, yet even counterfactual statements are not all examples of causality. Consider the following two statements:

# ''If A were a triangle, then A would have three sides.''
# ''If switch S were thrown, then bulb B would light.''

In the first case, it would not be correct to say that A's being a triangle ''caused'' it to have three sides, since the relationship between triangularity and three-sidedness is that of definition. The property of having three sides actually determines A's state as a triangle. Nonetheless, even when interpreted counterfactually, the first statement is true. An early version of Aristotle's "four cause" theory is described as recognizing "essential cause". In this version of the theory, that the closed polygon has three sides is said to be the "essential cause" of its being a triangle.&lt;ref name="Graham 1987"/&gt; This use of the word 'cause' is of course now far obsolete. Nevertheless, it is within the scope of ordinary language to say that it is essential to a triangle that it has three sides.

A full grasp of the concept of conditionals is important to [[understanding]] the literature on causality. In everyday language, loose conditional statements are often enough made, and need to be interpreted carefully.

===Questionable cause===
{{Main|Questionable cause}}

Fallacies of questionable cause, also known as causal fallacies, ''non-causa pro causa'' (Latin for "non-cause for cause"), or false cause, are [[informal fallacy|informal fallacies]] where a cause is incorrectly identified.

==Theories==
{{Main|Causal model}}

===Counterfactual theories===
{{Main|Counterfactual conditional}}

Subjunctive conditionals are familiar from ordinary language. They are of the form, if A ''were'' the case, then B ''would'' be the case, or if A ''had been'' the case, then B ''would have been'' the case. Counterfactual conditionals are specifically subjunctive conditionals whose antecedents are in fact false, hence the name. However the term used technically may apply to conditionals with true antecedents as well.

Psychological research shows that people's thoughts about the causal relationships between events influences their judgments of the plausibility of counterfactual alternatives, and conversely, their [[counterfactual thinking]] about how a situation could have turned out differently changes their judgments of the causal role of events and agents. Nonetheless, their identification of the cause of an event, and their counterfactual thought about how the event could have turned out differently do not always coincide.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, R.M.J. (2005). ''The Rational Imagination: How People Create Counterfactual Alternatives to Reality.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; People distinguish between various sorts of causes, e.g., strong and weak causes.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G. &amp; Johnson-Laird, P.N. (1976). Language and Perception. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Research in the [[psychology of reasoning]] shows that people make different sorts of inferences from different sorts of causes, as found in the fields of cognitive linguistics&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, G., &amp; Johnson, M. (2003). ''Metaphors we live by''. University of Chicago press.&lt;/ref&gt; and accident analysis&lt;ref&gt;Branford, K. (2007). ''An investigation into the validity and reliability of the AcciMap approach''. Doctoral dissertation, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huang, H. (2015). ''Development of New Methods to Support Systemic Incident Analysis.'' Doctoral dissertation, Queen Mary University of London.&lt;/ref&gt; for example.

In the philosophical literature, the suggestion that causation is to be defined in terms of a counterfactual relation is made by the 18th-century Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]]. Hume remarks that we may define the relation of cause and effect such that "where, if the first object had not been, the second never had existed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hume|first1=David|title=An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding|date=1748|location=Sec. VII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More full-fledged analysis of causation in terms of counterfactual conditionals only came in the 20th century after development of the possible world semantics for the evaluation of counterfactual conditionals. In his 1973 paper "Causation," [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] proposed the following definition of the notion of ''causal dependence'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=David|title=Causation|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=1973|volume=70|issue=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:An event E ''causally depends'' on C if, and only if, (i) if C had occurred, then E would have occurred, and (ii) if C had not occurred, then E would not have occurred.

Causation is then defined as a chain of causal dependence. That is, C causes E if and only if there exists a sequence of events C, D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... D&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;, E such that each event in the sequence depends on the previous.

Note that the analysis does not purport to explain how we make causal judgements or how we reason about causation, but rather to give a metaphysical account of what it is for there to be a causal relation between some pair of events. If correct, the analysis has the power to explain certain features of causation. Knowing that causation is a matter of counterfactual dependence, we may reflect on the nature of counterfactual dependence to account for the nature of causation. For example, in his paper "Counterfactual Dependence and Time's Arrow," Lewis sought to account for the time-directedness of counterfactual dependence in terms of the semantics of the counterfactual conditional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=David|title=Counterfactual Dependence and Time's Arrow|journal=Nous|date=1979|volume=13|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; If correct, this theory can serve to explain a fundamental part of our experience, which is that we can only causally affect the future but not the past.

===Probabilistic causation===
{{Main|Probabilistic causation}}
Interpreting causation as a [[Determinism|deterministic]] relation means that if ''A'' causes ''B'', then ''A'' must ''always'' be followed by ''B''. In this sense, war does not cause deaths, nor does [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] cause [[cancer]] or [[emphysema]]. As a result, many turn to a notion of probabilistic causation. Informally, ''A'' ("The person is a smoker") probabilistically causes ''B'' ("The person has now or will have cancer at some time in the future"), if the information that ''A'' occurred increases the likelihood of ''B''s occurrence. Formally, P{''B''|''A''}≥ P{''B''} where P{''B''|''A''} is the conditional probability that ''B'' will occur given the information that ''A'' occurred, and P{''B''}is the probability that ''B'' will occur having no knowledge whether ''A'' did or did not occur. This intuitive condition is not adequate as a definition for probabilistic causation because of its being too general and thus not meeting our intuitive notion of cause and effect.  For example, if ''A'' denotes the event "The person is a smoker," ''B'' denotes the event "The person now has or will have cancer at some time in the future" and ''C'' denotes the event "The person now has or will have emphysema some time in the future," then the following three relationships hold: P{''B''|''A''} ≥ P{''B''}, P{''C''|''A''} ≥ P{''C''} and P{''B''|''C''} ≥ P{''B''}.  The last relationship states that knowing that the person has emphysema increases the likelihood that he will have cancer.  The reason for this is that having the information that the person has emphysema increases the likelihood that the person is a smoker, thus indirectly increasing the likelihood that the person will have cancer.  However, we would not want to conclude that having emphysema causes cancer. Thus, we need additional conditions such as temporal relationship of ''A'' to ''B'' and a rational explanation as to the mechanism of action. It is hard to quantify this last requirement and thus different authors prefer somewhat different definitions.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Causal calculus===
When experimental interventions are infeasible or illegal, the derivation of cause effect relationship from observational studies must rest on some qualitative theoretical assumptions, for example, that symptoms do not cause diseases, usually expressed in the form of missing arrows in [[causal graphs]] such as [[Bayesian network]]s or [[path analysis (statistics)|path diagrams]]. The theory underlying these derivations relies on the distinction between ''conditional probabilities'', as in &lt;math&gt;P(cancer|smoking)&lt;/math&gt;, and ''interventional probabilities'', as in &lt;math&gt;P(cancer|do(smoking))&lt;/math&gt;. The former reads: "the probability of finding cancer in a person known to smoke, having started, unforced by the experimenter, to do so at an unspecified time in the past", while the latter reads: "the probability of finding cancer in a person forced by the experimenter to smoke at a specified time in the past". The former is a statistical notion that can be estimated by observation with negligible intervention by the experimenter, while the latter is a causal notion which is estimated in an experiment with an important controlled randomized intervention. It is specifically characteristic of [[quantum mechanics|quantal phenomena]] that observations defined by incompatible variables always involve important intervention by the experimenter, as described quantitatively by the Heisenberg [[uncertainty principle]].{{Vague|date=June 2016}} In classical [[thermodynamics]], [[thermodynamic process|processes]] are initiated by interventions called [[thermodynamic operation]]s. In other branches of science, for example [[astronomy]], the experimenter can often observe with negligible intervention.

The theory of "causal calculus"&lt;ref name=Pearl&gt;Pearl, Judea (2000). ''Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference'', Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; permits one to infer interventional probabilities from conditional probabilities in causal [[Bayesian network]]s with unmeasured variables. One very practical result of this theory is the characterization of [[confounding variables]], namely, a sufficient set of variables that, if adjusted for, would yield the correct causal effect between variables of interest. It can be shown that a sufficient set for estimating the causal effect of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is any set of non-descendants of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; that &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-separate &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; after removing all arrows emanating from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. This criterion, called "backdoor", provides a mathematical definition of "confounding" and helps researchers identify accessible sets of variables worthy of measurement.

===Structure learning===
While derivations in causal calculus rely on the structure of the causal graph, parts of the causal structure can, under certain assumptions, be learned from statistical data. The basic idea goes back to [[Sewall Wright]]'s 1921 work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = S | year = | title = Correlation and Causation | url = | journal = Journal of Agricultural Research | volume = 20 | issue = 7| pages = 557–585 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Path analysis (statistics)|path analysis]]. A "recovery" algorithm was developed by Rebane and Pearl (1987)&lt;ref&gt;Rebane, G. and Pearl, J., "The Recovery of Causal Poly-trees from Statistical Data", ''Proceedings, 3rd Workshop on Uncertainty in AI'', (Seattle) pp. 222–228, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; which rests on Wright's distinction between the three possible types of causal substructures allowed in a [[directed acyclic graph]] (DAG):

# &lt;math&gt;X \rightarrow Y \rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;X \leftarrow Y \rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;X \rightarrow Y \leftarrow Z&lt;/math&gt;

Type 1 and type 2 represent the same statistical dependencies (i.e., &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; are independent given &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;) and are, therefore, indistinguishable within purely [[cross-sectional data]]. Type 3, however, can be uniquely identified, since &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; are marginally independent and all other pairs are dependent. Thus, while the ''skeletons'' (the graphs stripped of arrows) of these three triplets are identical, the directionality of the arrows is partially identifiable. The same distinction applies when &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; have common ancestors, except that one must first condition on those ancestors. Algorithms have been developed to systematically determine the skeleton of the underlying graph and, then, orient all arrows whose directionality is dictated by the conditional independencies observed.&lt;ref name="Pearl" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spirites, P. and Glymour, C., "An algorithm for fast recovery of sparse causal graphs", ''Social Science Computer Review'', Vol. 9, pp. 62–72, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spirtes, P. and Glymour, C. and Scheines, R., ''Causation, Prediction, and Search'', New York: Springer-Verlag, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Verma, T. and Pearl, J., "Equivalence and Synthesis of Causal Models", ''Proceedings of the Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence'', (July, Cambridge, Massachusetts), pp. 220–227, 1990. Reprinted in P. Bonissone, M. Henrion, L.N. Kanal and J.F.\ Lemmer (Eds.), ''Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence 6'', Amsterdam: Elsevier Science Publishers, B.V., pp. 225–268, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative methods of structure learning search through the ''many'' possible causal structures among the variables, and remove ones which are strongly incompatible with the observed [[correlation]]s. In general this leaves a set of possible causal relations, which should then be tested by analyzing time series data or, preferably, designing appropriately controlled [[experiment]]s. In contrast with Bayesian Networks, [[path analysis (statistics)|path analysis]] (and its generalization, [[structural equation model]]ing), serve better to estimate a known causal effect or to test a causal model than to generate causal hypotheses.

For nonexperimental data, causal direction can often be inferred if information about time is available. This is because (according to many, though not all, theories) causes must precede their effects temporally. This can be determined by statistical [[time series]] models, for instance, or with a statistical test based on the idea of [[Granger causality]], or by direct experimental manipulation. The use of temporal data can permit statistical tests of a pre-existing theory of causal direction. For instance, our degree of confidence in the direction and nature of causality is much greater when supported by [[cross-correlation]]s, [[ARIMA]] models, or [[Cross-spectrum|cross-spectral analysis]] using vector time series data than by [[cross-sectional data]].

===Derivation theories===
Nobel Prize laureate [[Herbert A. Simon]] and philosopher [[Nicholas Rescher]]&lt;ref name="SimRes"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simon | first1 = Herbert | last2 = Rescher | first2 = Nicholas | year = 1966 | title = Cause and Counterfactual | url = | journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 323–340 | doi=10.1086/288105}}&lt;/ref&gt; claim that the asymmetry of the causal relation is unrelated to the asymmetry of any mode of implication that contraposes. Rather, a causal relation is not a relation between values of variables, but a function of one variable (the cause) on to another (the effect). So, given a system of equations, and a set of variables appearing in these equations, we can introduce an asymmetric relation among individual equations and variables that corresponds perfectly to our commonsense notion of a causal ordering. The system of equations must have certain properties, most importantly, if some values are chosen arbitrarily, the remaining values will be determined uniquely through a path of serial discovery that is perfectly causal. They postulate the inherent serialization of such a system of equations may correctly capture causation in all empirical fields, including physics and economics.

===Manipulation theories===
Some theorists have equated causality with manipulability.&lt;ref name="Collingwood"&gt;Collingwood, R. (1940) ''An Essay on Metaphysics.'' Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gasking"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gasking | first1 = D | year = 1955 | title = Causation and Recipes | url = | journal = Mind | volume = 64 | issue = 256| pages = 479–487 | doi=10.1093/mind/lxiv.256.479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MenPrice"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Menzies | first1 = P. | last2 = Price | first2 = H. | year = 1993 | title = Causation as a Secondary Quality | url = | journal = British Journal for the Philosophy of Science | volume = 44 | issue = 2| pages = 187–203 | doi=10.1093/bjps/44.2.187| citeseerx = 10.1.1.28.9736 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vonWright"&gt;von Wright, G. (1971) ''Explanation and Understanding.'' [[Cornell University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; Under these theories, ''x'' causes ''y'' only in the case that one can change ''x'' in order to change ''y''. This coincides with commonsense notions of causations, since often we ask causal questions in order to change some feature of the world. For instance, we are interested in knowing the causes of crime so that we might find ways of reducing it.

These theories have been criticized on two primary grounds. First, theorists complain that these accounts are [[Begging the question|circular]]. Attempting to reduce causal claims to manipulation requires that manipulation is more basic than causal interaction. But describing manipulations in non-causal terms has provided a substantial difficulty.

The second criticism centers around concerns of [[anthropocentrism]]. It seems to many people that causality is some existing relationship in the world that we can harness for our desires. If causality is identified with our manipulation, then this intuition is lost. In this sense, it makes humans overly central to interactions in the world.

Some attempts to defend manipulability theories are recent accounts that don't claim to reduce causality to manipulation. These accounts use manipulation as a sign or feature in causation without claiming that manipulation is more fundamental than causation.&lt;ref name="Pearl" /&gt;&lt;!-- Pearl, Judea (2000) ''Causality'', Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-77362-8&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;Woodward, James (2003) ''Making Things Happen: A Theory of Causal Explanation''. [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-515527-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process theories===
Some theorists are interested in distinguishing between causal processes and non-causal processes (Russell 1948; Salmon 1984).&lt;ref name="Salmon"&gt;Salmon, W. (1984) ''Scientific Explanation and the Causal Structure of the World''. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;Russell, B. (1948) ''Human Knowledge''. Simon and Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; These theorists often want to distinguish between a process and a [[pseudo-process]]. As an example, a ball moving through the air (a process) is contrasted with the motion of a shadow (a pseudo-process). The former is causal in nature while the latter is not.

Salmon (1984)&lt;ref name="Salmon" /&gt; claims that causal processes can be identified by their ability to transmit an alteration over space and time. An alteration of the ball (a mark by a pen, perhaps) is carried with it as the ball goes through the air. On the other hand, an alteration of the shadow (insofar as it is possible) will not be transmitted by the shadow as it moves along.

These theorists claim that the important concept for understanding causality is not causal relationships or causal interactions, but rather identifying causal processes. The former notions can then be defined in terms of causal processes.

===Science===
For the scientific investigation of efficient causality, the cause and effect are each best conceived of as temporally transient processes.

Within the conceptual frame of the [[scientific method]], an investigator sets up several distinct and contrasting temporally transient material processes that have the structure of [[experiment]]s, and records candidate material responses, normally intending  to determine causality in the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949). ''Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance'', Oxford University Press, Oxford UK, p. 18: "... scientific work will always be the search for causal interdependence of phenomena."&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, one may want to [[know]] whether a high intake of [[carrot]]s causes humans to develop the [[bubonic plague]]. The quantity of carrot intake is a process that is varied from occasion to occasion. The occurrence or non-occurrence of subsequent bubonic plague is recorded. To establish causality, the experiment must fulfill certain criteria, only one example of which is mentioned here. For example, instances of the hypothesized cause must be set up to occur at a time when the hypothesized effect is relatively unlikely in the absence of the hypothesized cause; such unlikelihood is to be established by empirical evidence. A mere observation of a [[correlation does not imply causation|correlation]] is not nearly adequate to establish causality. In nearly all cases, establishment of causality relies on repetition of experiments and probabilistic reasoning. Hardly ever is causality established more firmly than as more or less probable. It is often most convenient for establishment of causality if the contrasting material states of affairs are fully comparable, and differ through only one variable factor, perhaps measured by a real number. Otherwise, experiments are usually difficult or impossible to interpret.

In some sciences, it is very difficult or nearly impossible to set up material states of affairs that closely test hypotheses of causality. Such sciences can in some sense be regarded as "softer".

====Physics====
{{Main|Causality (physics)}}

One has to be careful in the use of the word cause in physics. Properly speaking, the hypothesized cause and the hypothesized effect are each temporally transient processes. For example, force is a useful concept for the explanation of acceleration, but force is not by itself a cause. More is needed. For example, a temporally transient process might be characterized by a definite change of force at a definite time. Such a process can be regarded as a cause. Causality is not inherently implied in [[equations of motion]], but postulated as an additional [[constraint (classical mechanics)|constraint]] that needs to be satisfied (i.e. a cause always precedes its effect). This constraint has mathematical implications&lt;ref name=kinsler2011&gt;

Causality is one of the most fundamental and essential notions of physics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein|Einstein, A.]] (1910/2005). 'On Boltzmann’s Principle and some immediate consequences thereof', unpublished manuscript of a 1910 lecture by Einstein, translated by B. Duplantier and E. Parks, reprinted on pp. 183–199 in ''Einstein,1905–2005, Poincaré Seminar 2005'', edited by  T. Damour, O. Darrigol, B. Duplantier, V. Rivasseau, Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, {{ISBN|3-7643-7435-7}}, from ''Einstein, Albert: The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein'', 1987–2005, Hebrew University and Princeton University Press; p. 183: "All natural science is based upon the hypothesis of the complete causal connection of all events."&lt;/ref&gt; Causal efficacy cannot propagate faster than light. Otherwise, reference coordinate systems could be constructed (using the [[Lorentz transform]] of [[special relativity]]) in which an observer would see an effect precede its cause (i.e. the postulate of causality would be violated).

Causal notions appear in the context of the flow of mass-energy. For example, it is commonplace to argue that causal efficacy can be propagated by waves (such as electromagnetic waves) only if they propagate no faster than light. Wave packets have [[group velocity]] and [[phase velocity]]. For waves that propagate causal efficacy, both of these must travel no faster than light. Thus light waves often propagate causal efficacy but [[matter wave|de Broglie waves]] often have phase velocity faster than light and consequently cannot be propagating causal efficacy.

Causal notions are important in general relativity to the extent that the existence of an arrow of time demands that the universe's semi-Riemannian manifold be orientable, so that "future" and "past" are globally definable quantities.

====Engineering====
A [[causal system]] is a [[system]] with output and internal states that depends only on the current and previous input values. A system that has ''some'' dependence on input values from the future (in addition to possible past or current input values) is termed an '''acausal''' system, and a system that depends ''solely'' on future input values is an [[anticausal system]]. Acausal filters, for example, can only exist as postprocessing filters, because these filters can extract future values from a memory buffer or a file.

====Biology, medicine and epidemiology====
[[Austin Bradford Hill]] built upon the work of [[David Hume|Hume]] and [[Karl Popper|Popper]] and suggested in his paper "The Environment and Disease: Association or Causation?" that aspects of an association such as strength, consistency, specificity and temporality be considered in attempting to distinguish causal from noncausal associations in the epidemiological situation. (See [[Bradford-Hill criteria]].) He did not note however, that temporality is the only necessary criterion among those aspects. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are increasingly used in epidemiology to help enlighten causal thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chiolero|first=A|author2=Paradis, G |author3=Kaufman, JS |title=Assessing the possible direct effect of birth weight on childhood blood pressure: a sensitivity analysis|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|date=1 January 2014|volume=179|issue=1|pages=4–11|pmid=24186972|doi=10.1093/aje/kwt228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psychology====
{{Main|Causal reasoning}}
Psychologists take an empirical approach to causality, investigating how people and non-human animals detect or infer causation from sensory information, prior experience and [[innatism|innate knowledge]].

;Attribution
[[Attribution theory]] is the [[theory]] concerning how people explain individual occurrences of causation. [[Attribution (psychology)|Attribution]] can be external (assigning causality to an outside agent or force—claiming that some outside thing motivated the event) or internal (assigning causality to factors within the person—taking personal [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] or [[accountability]] for one's actions and claiming that the person was directly responsible for the event). Taking causation one step further, the type of attribution a person provides influences their future behavior.

The intention behind the cause or the effect can be covered by the subject of [[action (philosophy)|action]]. See also [[accident]]; [[blame]]; [[intent (law)|intent]]; and responsibility.

;Causal powers
Whereas [[David Hume#Causation|David Hume]] argued that causes are inferred from non-causal observations, [[Immanuel Kant]] claimed that people have innate assumptions about causes. Within psychology, [[Patricia Cheng]] (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cheng | first1 = P.W. | year = 1997 | title = From Covariation to Causation: A Causal Power Theory | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 104 | issue = 2| pages = 367–405 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.104.2.367}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to reconcile the Humean and Kantian views. According to her power PC theory, people filter observations of events through a basic belief that causes have the power to generate (or prevent) their effects, thereby inferring specific cause-effect relations.

;Causation and salience
Our view of causation depends on what we consider to be the relevant events. Another way to view the statement, "Lightning causes thunder" is to see both lightning and thunder as two perceptions of the same event, viz., an electric discharge that we perceive first visually and then aurally.

;Naming and causality
David Sobel and Alison Gopnik from the Psychology Department of UC Berkeley designed a device known as ''the blicket detector'' which would turn on when an object was placed on it. Their research suggests that "even young children will easily and swiftly learn about a new causal power of an object and spontaneously use that information in classifying and naming the object."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gopnik |first1=A |first2=David M. |last2=Sobel |title=Detecting Blickets: How Young Children Use Information about Novel Causal Powers in Categorization and Induction |journal=Child Development |date=September–October 2000 |volume=71 |issue=5 |pages=1205–1222 |doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00224 |pmid=11108092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Perception of launching events
Some researchers such as Anjan Chatterjee at the University of Pennsylvania and Jonathan Fugelsang at the University of Waterloo are using neuroscience techniques to investigate the neural and psychological underpinnings of causal launching events in which one object causes another object to move. Both temporal and spatial factors can be manipulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Straube |doi=10.3389/fnhum.2010.00028 |pmid=20463866 |title=Space and time in perceptual causality |year=2010 |journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience |first1=B |last2=Chatterjee |first2=A |volume=4 |page=28 |pmc=2868299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

See [[Causal Reasoning (Psychology)]] for more information.

====Statistics and economics====
[[Statistics]] and [[economics]] usually employ pre-existing data or experimental data to infer causality by regression methods. The body of statistical techniques involves substantial use of [[regression analysis]]. Typically a linear relationship such as

:&lt;math&gt;y_i = a_0 + a_1x_{1,i} + a_2x_{2,i} + ... + a_kx_{k,i} + e_i&lt;/math&gt;

is postulated, in which &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; is the ''i''th observation of the dependent variable (hypothesized to be the caused variable), &lt;math&gt;x_{j,i}&lt;/math&gt; for ''j''=1,...,''k'' is the ''i''th observation on the ''j''th independent variable (hypothesized to be a causative variable), and &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; is the error term for the ''i''th observation (containing the combined effects of all other causative variables, which must be uncorrelated with the included independent variables). If there is reason to believe that none of the &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt;s is caused by ''y'', then estimates of the coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_j&lt;/math&gt; are obtained. If the null hypothesis that &lt;math&gt;a_j=0&lt;/math&gt; is rejected, then the alternative hypothesis that &lt;math&gt;a_{j} \ne 0 &lt;/math&gt; and equivalently that &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; causes ''y'' cannot be rejected. On the other hand, if the null hypothesis that &lt;math&gt;a_j=0&lt;/math&gt; cannot be rejected, then equivalently the hypothesis of no causal effect of &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; on ''y'' cannot be rejected. Here the notion of causality is one of contributory causality as discussed [[Causality#Necessary and sufficient causes|above]]: If the true value &lt;math&gt;a_j \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, then a change in &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; will result in a change in ''y'' ''unless'' some other causative variable(s), either included in the regression or implicit in the error term, change in such a way as to exactly offset its effect; thus a change in &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; is ''not sufficient'' to change ''y''. Likewise, a change in &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; is ''not necessary'' to change ''y'', because a change in ''y'' could be caused by something implicit in the error term (or by some other causative explanatory variable included in the model).

The above way of testing for causality requires belief that there is no reverse causation, in which ''y'' would cause &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt;. This belief can be established in one of several ways. First, the variable &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; may be a non-economic variable: for example, if rainfall amount &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; is hypothesized to affect the futures price ''y'' of some agricultural commodity, it is impossible that in fact the futures price affects rainfall amount (provided that cloud seeding is never attempted). Second, the [[instrumental variables]] technique may be employed to remove any reverse causation by introducing a role for other variables (instruments) that are known to be unaffected by the dependent variable. Third, the principle that effects cannot precede causes can be invoked, by including on the right side of the regression only variables that precede in time the dependent variable; this principle is invoked, for example, in testing for [[Granger causality]] and in its multivariate analog, [[vector autoregression]], both of which control for lagged values of the dependent variable while testing for causal effects of lagged independent variables.

Regression analysis controls for other relevant variables by including them as regressors (explanatory variables). This helps to avoid false inferences of causality due to the presence of a third, underlying, variable that influences both the potentially causative variable and the potentially caused variable: its effect on the potentially caused variable is captured by directly including it in the regression, so that effect will not be picked up as an indirect effect through the potentially causative variable of interest.

Given the above procedures, coincidental (as opposed to causal) correlation can be probabilistically rejected if data samples are large and if regression results pass [[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] tests showing that the correlations hold even for data that were not used in the regression.

===Metaphysics===
The [[determinism|deterministic]] world-view holds that the history of the [[universe]] can be exhaustively represented as a [[chain of events|progression of events]] following one after as cause and effect.&lt;ref name="Sklar"&gt;Sklar, L. (1995). Determinism, pp. 117–119 in ''A Companion to Metaphysics'', edited by Kim, J. Sosa, E., Blackwell, Oxford UK, pp. 177–181.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] version of this holds that there is no such thing as "[[free will]]". [[Compatibilism]], on the other hand, holds that determinism is compatible with, or even necessary for, free will.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, G. (1995). Free will, pp. 175–182 in ''A Companion to Metaphysics'', edited by Kim, J. Sosa, E., Blackwell, Oxford UK, pp. 177–181.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Management===
[[File:Ishikawa Fishbone Diagram.svg|thumb|Used in management and engineering, an [[Ishikawa diagram]] shows the factors that cause the effect. Smaller arrows connect the sub-causes to major causes.]]
For quality control in manufacturing in the 1960s, [[Kaoru Ishikawa]] developed a cause and effect diagram, known as an [[Ishikawa diagram]] or fishbone diagram. The diagram categorizes causes, such as into the six main categories shown here. These categories are then sub-divided. Ishikawa's method identifies "causes" in brainstorming sessions conducted among various groups involved in the manufacturing process. These groups can then be labeled as categories in the diagrams. The use of these diagrams has now spread beyond quality control, and they are used in other areas of management and in design and engineering. Ishikawa diagrams have been criticized for failing to make the distinction between necessary conditions and sufficient conditions. It seems that Ishikawa was not even aware of this distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gregory | first1 = Frank Hutson | year = 1992 | title = Cause, Effect, Efficiency &amp; Soft Systems Models, Warwick Business School Research Paper No. 42 |issn=0160-5682 | url = | journal = Journal of the Operational Research Society | volume = 44 | issue = 4| pages = 333–344 | doi=10.1057/jors.1993.63| title-link = s:Cause, Effect, Efficiency &amp; Soft Systems Models }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanities===

====History====
In the discussion of history, events are sometimes considered as if in some way being agents that can then bring about other historical events. Thus, the combination of poor harvests, the hardships of the peasants, high taxes, lack of representation of the people, and kingly ineptitude are among the ''causes'' of the [[French Revolution]]. This is a somewhat [[Plato]]nic and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] view that [[Concretization|reifies]] causes as [[Ontology|ontological entities]]. In Aristotelian terminology, this use approximates to the case of the ''efficient'' cause.

Some philosophers of history such as Arthur Danto have claimed that "explanations in history and elsewhere" describe "not simply an event—something that happens—but a change".&lt;ref&gt;Danto, Arthur (1965) ''Analytical Philosophy of History'', 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many practicing historians, they treat causes as intersecting actions and sets of actions which bring about "larger changes", in Danto's words: to decide "what are the elements which persist through a change" is "rather simple" when treating an individual's "shift in attitude", but "it is considerably more complex and metaphysically challenging when we are interested in such a change as, say, the break-up of feudalism or the emergence of nationalism".&lt;ref&gt;Danto, Arthur (1965) ''Analytical Philosophy of History'', 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the historical debate about causes has focused on the relationship between communicative and other actions, between singular and repeated ones, and between actions, structures of action or group and institutional contexts and wider sets of conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitson, Mark (2014) ''History and Causality'', 86–116.&lt;/ref&gt; John Gaddis has distinguished between exceptional and general causes (following Marc Bloch) and between "routine" and "distinctive links" in causal relationships: "in accounting for what happened at Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, we attach greater importance to the fact that President Truman ordered the dropping of an atomic bomb than to the decision of the Army Air Force to carry out his orders."&lt;ref&gt;Gaddis, John L. (2002), ''The Landscape of History: How Historians Map the Past'', 64.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also pointed to the difference between immediate, intermediate and distant causes.&lt;ref&gt;Gaddis, John L. (2002), ''The Landscape of History: How Historians Map the Past'', 95.&lt;/ref&gt; For his part, Christopher Lloyd puts forward four "general concepts of causation" used in history:  the "metaphysical idealist concept, which asserts that the phenomena of the universe are products of or emanations from an omnipotent being or such final cause"; "the empiricist (or Humean) regularity concept, which is based on the idea of causation being a matter of constant conjunctions of events"; "the functional/teleological/consequential concept", which is "goal-directed, so that goals are causes"; and the "realist, structurist and dispositional approach, which sees relational structures and internal dispositions as the causes of phenomena".&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, Christopher (1993) ''Structures of History'', 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Law ====
{{Main|Causation (law)}}
According to [[law]] and [[jurisprudence]], '''legal cause''' must be demonstrated to hold a [[defendant]] liable for a [[crime]] or a [[tort]] (i.e. a civil wrong such as negligence or trespass). It must be proven that causality, or a "sufficient causal link" relates the defendant's actions to the criminal event or damage in question. Causation is also an essential legal element that must be proven to qualify for remedy measures under [[international trade law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dukgeun Ahn &amp; William J. Moon, Alternative Approach to Causation Analysis in Trade Remedy Investigations, ''Journal of World Trade''|ssrn=1601531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theology===
Note the concept of omnicausality in [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] theology, which is the belief that God has set in motion all events at the dawn of time; he is the determiner and the cause of all things. It is therefore an attempt to rectify the apparent [[incompatibilism|incompatibility]] between determinism and the existence of an [[omnipotence|omnipotent god]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Hindu philosophy===
{{See also|Karma}}

[[Vedic period]] (c. 1750–500 BCE) literature has karma's Eastern origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krishan|first1=Y.|title=The Vedic Origins of the Doctrine of Karma|journal=South Asian Studies|date=6 August 2010|volume=4|issue=1|pages=51–55|doi=10.1080/02666030.1988.9628366}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karma is the belief held by [[Sanathana Dharma]] and major religions that a person's actions cause certain effects in the current life and/or in future [[reincarnation|life]], positively or negatively. The various philosophical schools ([[darsanas]]) provide different accounts of the subject. The doctrine of '''satkaryavada''' affirms that the effect inheres in the cause in some way. The effect is thus either a real or apparent modification of the cause. The doctrine of '''asatkaryavada''' affirms that the effect does not inhere in the cause, but is a new arising. See [[Nyaya]] for some details of the theory of causation in the Nyaya school. In [[Brahma Samhita]], Brahma describes Krishna as the prime cause of all causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://vedabase.net/bs/5/1/en | title=Brahma Samhita, Chapter 5: Hymn to the Absolute Truth | publisher=Bhaktivedanta Book Trust | accessdate=19 May 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507215250/http://vedabase.net/bs/5/1/en | archive-date=7 May 2014 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-18-13.html Bhagavad-gītā 18.14] identifies five causes for any action (knowing which it can be perfected): the body, the individual soul, the senses, the efforts and the supersoul.

According to [[Monier Monier-Williams|Monier-Williams]], in the [[Nyāya]] causation theory from Sutra I.2.I,2 in the [[Vaisheshika]] philosophy, from causal non-existence is effectual non-existence; but, not effectual non-existence from causal non-existence. A cause precedes an effect.  With a threads and cloth metaphors, three causes are:
	
# Co-inherence cause: resulting from substantial contact, 'substantial causes', threads are substantial to cloth, corresponding to Aristotle's material cause.	
# Non-substantial cause: Methods putting threads into cloth, corresponding to Aristotle's formal cause.
# Instrumental cause:  Tools to make the cloth, corresponding to Aristotle's efficient cause.

Monier-Williams also proposed that  Aristotle's and the Nyaya's causality are considered conditional aggregates necessary to man's productive work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=co7Mkn2SUQ8C | title=Indian Wisdom or Examples of the Religious, Philosophical and Ethical Doctrines of the Hindus | publisher=Oxford | author=Williams, Monier | year=1875 | location=London | page=81 | isbn=9781108007955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist philosophy===
{{See also|Pratītyasamutpāda}}

The general or universal definition of pratityasamutpada (or "dependent origination" or "dependent arising" or "interdependent co-arising") is that everything arises in dependence upon multiple causes and conditions; nothing exists as a singular, independent entity. A traditional example in Buddhist texts is of three sticks standing upright and leaning against each other and supporting each other. If one stick is taken away, the other two will fall to the ground.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Causality in the [[Chittamatrin]] Buddhist school approach, [[Asanga]]'s (c. 400 CE) mind-only Buddhist school, asserts that objects cause consciousness in the mind's image. Because causes precede effects, which must be different entities, then subject and object are different. For this school, there are no objects which are entities external to a perceiving consciousness. The Chittamatrin and the [[Yogachara]] [[Svatantrika]] schools accept that there are no objects external to the observer's causality.  This largely follows the [[Nikayas]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hopkins|first1=Jeffrey|title=Meditation on Emptiness|date=15 June 1996|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0861711109|page=367|edition=Rep Sub}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lusthaus|first1=Dan|title=What is and isn't Yogācāra|url=http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro.html|website=Yogacara Buddhism Research Associations|publisher=Yogacara Buddhism Research Associations: Resources for East Asian Language and Thought, A.

The [[Abhidharmakośakārikā#Karma|Abhidharmakośakārikā]] approach is [[Vasubandhu]]'s [[Abhidharma]] commentary text in the [[Sarvāstivāda]] school (c. 500 CE).  It has four intricate causal conditioning constructions with the: 1) root cause, 2) immediate antecedent, 3) object support, and 4) predominance. Then, the six causes are: 1) instrumentality (kāraṇahetu), deemed the primary factor in result production; 2) simultaneity or coexistence, which connects phenomena that arise simultaneously; 3) homogeneity, explaining the homogenous flow that evokes phenomena continuity; 4) association, which operates only between mental factors and explains why consciousness appears as assemblages to mental factors; 5) dominance, which forms one's habitual cognitive and behaviorist dispositions; and 6) fruition, referring to whatever is the actively wholesome or unwholesome result. The four conditions and six causes interact with each other in explaining phenomenal experience: for instance, each conscious moment acts both as the homogenous cause, as well as the immediate antecedent consciousness condition rise, and its concomitants, in a subsequent moment.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The [[Vaibhashika]] (c. 500 CE) is an [[early buddhist school]] which favors direct object contact and accepts simultaneous cause and effects. This is based in the consciousness example which says, intentions and feelings are mutually accompanying mental factors that support each other like poles in tripod.  In contrast, simultaneous cause and effect rejectors say that if the effect already exists, then it cannot effect the same way again.

===Baha’i===

The Baha'i concept of causation has been a unifying force for this young religion.  The belief in a common biological and ideological ancestry has made it possible for Baha'is to recognize Buddha, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad.  Unfortunately, this has led to the systematic persecution of Baha'is by many caliphates.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Lake, [https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-30/iran-s-secret-shunning-of-a-minority-faith "Iran's Secret Shunning of a Minority Faith"], ''Bloomberg'', January 30, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aristotelian====
{{Main|Four causes|Potentiality and actuality}}

[[Aristotle]] identified four kinds of answer or explanatory mode to various "Why?" questions. He thought that, for any given topic, all four kinds of explanatory mode were important, each in its own right. As a result of traditional specialized philosophical peculiarities of language, with translations between ancient Greek, Latin, and English, the word 'cause' is nowadays in specialized philosophical writings used to label Aristotle's four kinds.&lt;ref name="Graham 1987"&gt;Graham, D.W. (1987). [http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198243151.do#.UhqWXr5-8dE ''Aristotles's Two Systems''], Oxford University Press, Oxford UK, {{ISBN|0-19-824970-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisdomsupreme.com/dictionary/aristotles-four-causes.php&lt;/ref&gt; In ordinary language, there are various meanings of the word cause, the commonest referring to efficient cause, the topic of the present article.

* [[Material cause]], the material whence a thing has come or that which persists while it changes, as for example, one's mother or the bronze of a statue (see also [[substance theory]]).&lt;ref name="Soccio2011"&gt;{{cite book |first=D.J. |last=Soccio |year=2011 |title=Archetypes of Wisdom: An Introduction to Philosophy, 8th Ed.: An Introduction to Philosophy |publisher=Wadsworth |isbn=9781111837792 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zxVH9h-HDXYC&amp;pg=PA167 |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Formal cause]], whereby a thing's dynamic ''form'' or static ''shape'' determines the thing's properties and function, as a human differs from a statue of a human or as a statue differs from a lump of bronze.&lt;ref name="sep-aristotle-causality"&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrea |last=Falcon |editor=Edward N. Zalta |year=2012 |title=Aristotle on Causality |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Winter 2012 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/aristotle-causality/#FouCauSciNat |quote=In the ''Physics'', Aristotle builds on his general account of the four causes by developing explanatory principles that are specific to the study of nature. Here Aristotle insists that all four modes of explanation are called for in the study of natural phenomena, and that the job of "the student of nature is to bring the why-question back to them all in the way appropriate to the science of nature" (''Phys.'' 198 a 21–23). The best way to understand this methodological recommendation is the following: the science of nature is concerned with natural bodies insofar as they are subject to change, and the job of the student of nature is to provide the explanation of their natural change. The factors that are involved in the explanation of natural change turn out to be matter, form, that which produces the change, and the end of this change. Note that Aristotle does not say that all four explanatory factors are involved in the explanation of each and every instance of natural change. Rather, he says that an adequate explanation of natural change may involve a reference to all of them. Aristotle goes on by adding a specification on his doctrine of the four causes: the form and the end often coincide, and they are formally the same as that which produces the change (''Phys.'' 198 a 23–26).}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Efficient cause]], which imparts the first relevant ''movement'', as a human lifts a rock or raises a statue. This is the main topic of the present article.
* [[Final cause]], the criterion of completion, or the [[Telos (philosophy)|end]]; it may refer to an action or to an inanimate process. Examples: Socrates takes a walk after dinner for the sake of his health; earth falls to the lowest level because that is its nature.

Of Aristotle's four kinds or explanatory modes, only one, the 'efficient cause' is a cause as defined in the leading paragraph of this present article. The other three explanatory modes might be rendered material composition, structure and dynamics, and, again, criterion of completion. The word that Aristotle used was {{math|αἰτία}}. For the present purpose, that Greek word would be better translated as "explanation" than as "cause" as those words are most often used in current English. Another translation of Aristotle is that he meant "the four Becauses" as four kinds of answer to "why" questions.&lt;ref name="Graham 1987"/&gt;

Aristotle assumed efficient causality as referring to a basic fact of experience, not explicable by, or reducible to, anything more fundamental or basic.

In some works of Aristotle, the four causes are listed as (1) the essential cause, (2) the logical ground, (3) the moving cause, and (4) the final cause. In this listing, a statement of essential cause is a demonstration that an indicated object conforms to a definition of the word that refers to it. A statement of logical ground is an argument as to why an object statement is true. These are further examples of the idea that a "cause" in general in the context of Aristotle's usage is an "explanation".&lt;ref name="Graham 1987"/&gt;

The word "efficient" used here can also be translated from Aristotle as "moving" or "initiating".&lt;ref name="Graham 1987"/&gt;

Efficient causation was connected with [[Aristotelian physics]], which recognized the [[four classical elements|four elements]] (earth, air, fire, water), and added the [[Aether (classical element)|fifth element]] (aether). Water and earth by their intrinsic property ''gravitas'' or heaviness intrinsically fall toward, whereas air and fire by their intrinsic property ''levitas'' or lightness intrinsically rise away from, Earth's center—the motionless center of the universe—in a straight line while accelerating during the substance's approach to its natural place.

As air remained on Earth, however, and did not escape Earth while eventually achieving infinite speed—an absurdity—Aristotle inferred that the universe is finite in size and contains an invisible substance that held planet Earth and its atmosphere, the [[sublunary sphere]], centered in the universe. And since celestial bodies exhibit perpetual, unaccelerated motion orbiting planet Earth in unchanging relations, Aristotle inferred that the fifth element, ''aither'', that fills space and composes celestial bodies intrinsically moves in perpetual circles, the only constant motion between two points. (An object traveling a straight line from point ''A'' to ''B'' and back must stop at either point before returning to the other.)

Left to itself, a thing exhibits ''natural motion'', but can—according to [[Aristotelian metaphysics]]—exhibit ''enforced motion'' imparted by an efficient cause. The form of plants endows plants with the processes nutrition and reproduction, the form of animals adds locomotion, and the form of humankind adds reason atop these. A rock normally exhibits ''natural motion''—explained by the rock's material cause of being composed of the element earth—but a living thing can lift the rock, an ''enforced motion'' diverting the rock from its natural place and natural motion. As a further kind of explanation, Aristotle identified the final cause, specifying a purpose or criterion of completion in light of which something should be understood.

Aristotle himself explained,

{{Quotation|''Cause'' means

(a) in one sense, that as the result of whose presence something comes into being—e.g., the bronze of a statue and the silver of a cup, and the classes which contain these [i.e., the '''material cause'''];

(b) in another sense, the form or pattern; that is, the essential formula and the classes which contain it—e.g. the ratio 2:1 and number in general is the cause of the octave—and the parts of the formula [i.e., the '''formal cause'''].

(c) The source of the first beginning of change or rest; e.g. the man who plans is a cause, and the father is the cause of the child, and in general that which produces is the cause of that which is produced, and that which changes of that which is changed [i.e., the '''efficient cause'''].

(d) The same as "end"; i.e. the final cause; e.g., as the "end" of walking is health. For why does a man walk? "To be healthy", we say, and by saying this we consider that we have supplied the cause [the '''final cause'''].

(e) All those means towards the end which arise at the instigation of something else, as, e.g., fat-reducing, purging, drugs and instruments are causes of health; for they all have the end as their object, although they differ from each other as being some instruments, others actions [i.e., necessary conditions].|Metaphysics, Book 5, section 1013a, translated by Hugh Tredennick&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D5%3Asection%3D1013a Aristotle. Aristotle in 23 Volumes, Vols.17, 18, translated by Hugh Tredennick. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1933, 1989.] (hosted at perseus.tufts.edu.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aristotle further discerned two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. All causes, proper and accidental, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic. The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects are assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, and actual effects to operating causes.

Averting [[infinite regress]], Aristotle inferred the first mover—an [[unmoved mover]]. The first mover's motion, too, must have been caused, but, being an unmoved mover, must have moved only toward a particular goal or desire.

====Middle Ages====
In line with Aristotelian cosmology, [[Thomas Aquinas]] posed a hierarchy prioritizing Aristotle's four causes: "final &gt; efficient &gt; material &gt; formal".&lt;ref name="The Thomist article"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Thomist|author=William E. May|title=Knowledge of Causality in Hume and Aquinas|date=April 1970|accessdate=6 April 2011|url=http://www.thomist.org/journal/1970,%20vol.%2034/April/1970%20April%20A%20May%20web.htm|volume=34|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501095157/http://www.thomist.org/journal/1970%2C%20vol.%2034/April/1970%20April%20A%20May%20web.htm|archivedate=1 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas sought to identify the first efficient cause—now simply ''[[first cause]]''—as everyone would agree, said Aquinas, to call it ''God''. Later in the Middle Ages, many scholars conceded that the first cause was God, but explained that many earthly events occur within God's design or plan, and thereby scholars sought freedom to investigate the numerous ''secondary causes''.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

====After the Middle Ages====
&lt;!--[[David Hume]] links here--&gt;
{{See also|Humean definition of causality}}
For Aristotelian philosophy before Aquinas, the word cause had a broad meaning. It meant 'answer to a why question' or 'explanation', and Aristotelian scholars recognized four kinds of such answers. With the end of the [[Middle Ages]], in many philosophical usages, the meaning of the word 'cause' narrowed. It often lost that broad meaning, and was restricted to just one of the four kinds. For authors such as [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], in the field of political thinking, and [[Francis Bacon]], concerning [[science]] more generally, Aristotle's moving cause was the focus of their interest. A widely used modern definition of causality in this newly narrowed sense was assumed by [[David Hume]].&lt;ref name="The Thomist article"/&gt; He undertook an epistemological and metaphysical investigation of the notion of moving cause. He denied that we can ever perceive cause and effect, except by developing a habit or custom of mind where we come to associate two types of object or event, always contiguous and occurring one after the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=David|last=Hume|title= A Treatise of Human Nature|origyear=1739|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=342&amp;Itemid=28|editor-last=Selby-Bigge|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Part III, section XV of his book ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'', Hume expanded this to a list of eight ways of judging whether two things might be cause and effect. The first three:

:1. "The cause and effect must be contiguous in space and time."
:2. "The cause must be prior to the effect."
:3. "There must be a constant union betwixt the cause and effect. 'Tis chiefly this quality, that constitutes the relation."
And then additionally there are three connected criteria which come from our experience and which are "the source of most of our philosophical reasonings":
:4. "The same cause always produces the same effect, and the same effect never arises but from the same cause. This principle we derive from experience, and is the source of most of our philosophical reasonings."
:5. Hanging upon the above, Hume says that "where several different objects produce the same effect, it must be by means of some quality, which we discover to be common amongst them."
:6. And "founded on the same reason": "The difference in the effects of two resembling objects must proceed from that particular, in which they differ."
And then two more:
:7. "When any object increases or diminishes with the increase or diminution of its cause, 'tis to be regarded as a compounded effect, deriv'd from the union of the several different effects, which arise from the several different parts of the cause."
:8. An "object, which exists for any time in its full perfection without any effect, is not the sole cause of that effect, but requires to be assisted by some other principle, which may forward its influence and operation."

In 1949, physicist [[Max Born]] distinguished determination from causality. For him, determination meant that actual events are so linked by laws of nature that certainly reliable predictions and retrodictions can be made from sufficient present data about them. For him, there are two kinds of causation, which we may here call nomic or generic causation, and singular causation. Nomic causality means that cause and effect are linked by more or less certain or probabilistic general laws covering many possible or potential instances; we may recognize this as a probabilized version of criterion 3. of Hume mentioned just above. An occasion of singular causation is a particular occurrence of a definite complex of events that are physically linked by antecedence and contiguity, which we may here recognize as criteria 1. and 2. of Hume mentioned just above.&lt;ref name="Born"&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7286">In [[mathematics]], a '''complex differential form''' is a [[differential form]] on a [[manifold]] (usually a [[complex manifold]]) which is permitted to have [[complex number|complex]] coefficients.

Complex forms have broad applications in [[differential geometry]].  On complex manifolds, they are fundamental and serve as the basis for much of [[algebraic geometry]], [[Kähler metric|Kähler geometry]], and [[Hodge theory]].  Over non-complex manifolds, they also play a role in the study of [[almost complex structure]]s, the theory of [[spinor]]s, and [[CR structure]]s.

Typically, complex forms are considered because of some desirable decomposition that the forms admit.  On a complex manifold, for instance, any complex ''k''-form can be decomposed uniquely into a sum of so-called '''(''p'',''q'')-forms''': roughly, wedges of ''p'' [[exterior derivative|differentials]] of the holomorphic coordinates with ''q'' differentials of their complex conjugates.  The ensemble of (''p'',''q'')-forms becomes the primitive object of study, and determines a finer geometrical structure on the manifold than the ''k''-forms.  Even finer structures exist, for example, in cases where [[Hodge theory]] applies.

==Differential forms on a complex manifold==
Suppose that ''M'' is a [[complex manifold]].  Then there is a local [[coordinate system]] consisting of ''n'' complex-valued functions ''z''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;,...,z&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; such that the coordinate transitions from one patch to another are [[holomorphic function]]s of these variables.  The space of complex forms carries a rich structure, depending fundamentally on the fact that these transition functions are holomorphic, rather than just [[smooth manifold|smooth]].

===One-forms===
We begin with the case of one-forms.  First decompose the complex coordinates into their real and imaginary parts: ''z''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;=''x''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;+''iy''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt; for each ''j''.  Letting
:&lt;math&gt;dz^j=dx^j+idy^j,\quad d\bar{z}^j=dx^j-idy^j,&lt;/math&gt;
one sees that any differential form with complex coefficients can be written uniquely as a sum
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^n\left(f_jdz^j+g_jd\bar{z}^j\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Let &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;1,0&lt;/sup&gt; be the space of complex differential forms containing only &lt;math&gt;dz&lt;/math&gt;'s and &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;0,1&lt;/sup&gt; be the space of forms containing only &lt;math&gt;d\bar{z}&lt;/math&gt;'s.  One can show, by the [[Cauchy–Riemann equations]], that the spaces &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;1,0&lt;/sup&gt; and &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;0,1&lt;/sup&gt; are stable under holomorphic coordinate changes.  In other words, if one makes a different choice ''w''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; of holomorphic coordinate system, then elements of &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;1,0&lt;/sup&gt; transform [[tensor]]ially, as do elements of &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;0,1&lt;/sup&gt;.  Thus the spaces &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;0,1&lt;/sup&gt; and &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;1,0&lt;/sup&gt; determine complex [[vector bundle]]s on the complex manifold.

===Higher-degree forms===
The wedge product of complex differential forms is defined in the same way as with real forms.  Let ''p'' and ''q'' be a pair of non-negative integers &amp;le; ''n''.   The space &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;p,q&lt;/sup&gt; of (''p'',''q'')-forms is defined by taking linear combinations of the wedge products of ''p'' elements from &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;1,0&lt;/sup&gt; and ''q'' elements from &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;0,1&lt;/sup&gt;.  Symbolically,
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega^{p,q}=\Omega^{1,0}\wedge\dotsb\wedge\Omega^{1,0}\wedge\Omega^{0,1}\wedge\dotsb\wedge\Omega^{0,1}&lt;/math&gt;
where there are ''p'' factors of &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;1,0&lt;/sup&gt; and ''q'' factors of &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;0,1&lt;/sup&gt;.  Just as with the two spaces of 1-forms, these are stable under holomorphic changes of coordinates, and so determine vector bundles.

If ''E''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; is the space of all complex differential forms of total degree ''k'', then each element of ''E''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; can be expressed in a unique way as a linear combination of elements from among the spaces &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;p,q&lt;/sup&gt; with ''p''+''q''=''k''.  More succinctly, there is a [[direct sum of vector bundles|direct sum]] decomposition
:&lt;math&gt;E^k=\Omega^{k,0}\oplus\Omega^{k-1,1}\oplus\dotsb\oplus\Omega^{1,k-1}\oplus\Omega^{0,k}=\bigoplus_{p+q=k}\Omega^{p,q}.&lt;/math&gt;
Because this direct sum decomposition is stable under holomorphic coordinate changes, it also determines a vector bundle decomposition.

In particular, for each ''k'' and each ''p'' and ''q'' with ''p''+''q''=''k'', there is a canonical projection of vector bundles
:&lt;math&gt;\pi^{p,q}:E^k\rightarrow\Omega^{p,q}.&lt;/math&gt;

===The Dolbeault operators===
The usual exterior derivative defines a mapping of sections &lt;math&gt; d: \Omega^{r} \to \Omega^{r+1}&lt;/math&gt; via
:&lt;math&gt; d(\Omega^{p,q}) \subseteq \bigoplus_{r + s = p + q + 1} \Omega^{r,s}&lt;/math&gt;
The exterior derivative does not in itself reflect the more rigid complex structure of the manifold.

Using ''d'' and the projections defined in the previous subsection, it is possible to define the '''Dolbeault operators''':
:&lt;math&gt;\partial=\pi^{p+1,q}\circ d:\Omega^{p,q}\rightarrow\Omega^{p+1,q},\quad \bar{\partial}=\pi^{p,q+1}\circ d:\Omega^{p,q}\rightarrow\Omega^{p,q+1}&lt;/math&gt;
To describe these operators in local coordinates, let
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\sum_{|I|=p,|J|=q}\ f_{IJ}\,dz^I\wedge d\bar{z}^J\in\Omega^{p,q}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''I'' and ''J'' are [[multi-index|multi-indices]].  Then
:&lt;math&gt;\partial\alpha=\sum_{|I|,|J|}\sum_\ell \frac{\partial f_{IJ}}{\partial z^\ell}\,dz^\ell\wedge dz^I\wedge d\bar{z}^J&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\partial}\alpha=\sum_{|I|,|J|}\sum_\ell \frac{\partial f_{IJ}}{\partial \bar{z}^\ell}d\bar{z}^\ell\wedge dz^I\wedge d\bar{z}^J.&lt;/math&gt;

The following properties are seen to hold:
:&lt;math&gt;d=\partial+\bar{\partial}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\partial^2=\bar{\partial}^2=\partial\bar{\partial}+\bar{\partial}\partial=0.&lt;/math&gt;

These operators and their properties form the basis for [[Dolbeault cohomology]] and many aspects of [[Hodge theory]].

===Holomorphic forms===
For each ''p'', a '''holomorphic ''p''-form''' is a holomorphic section of the bundle &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;''p,0''&lt;/sup&gt;.  In local coordinates, then, a holomorphic ''p''-form can be written in the form

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\sum_{|I|=p}f_I\,dz^I&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt; f_I &lt;/math&gt; are holomorphic functions.  Equivalently, the (''p'',0)-form &amp;alpha; is holomorphic if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\partial}\alpha=0.&lt;/math&gt;
The [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] of holomorphic ''p''-forms is often written &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;, although this can sometimes lead to confusion so many authors tend to adopt an alternative notation.

In order to distinguish this notion of ''dhamma'' from the Indian conception where the term ''dharma'' meant reality (''atman''), in an ontological sense, the Buddha utilised the conception of result or consequence or fruit (''attha'', Sk.

For [[Sikh]]s, the word ''dharm'' means the path of righteousness and proper religious practice.&lt;ref name=rinehart138/&gt;

The word ''dharma'' was already in use in the [[historical Vedic religion]], and its meaning and conceptual scope has evolved over several millennia.&lt;ref name=phph/&gt; The [[antonym]] of dharma is ''[[adharma]]''.

==Etymology==
[[File:Dhamma inscription.jpg|thumb|The [[Prakrit]] word "''Dha-ṃ-ma''"/[[wikt:𑀥𑀁𑀫|𑀥𑀁𑀫]] ([[Sanskrit]]: Dharma [[wikt:धर्म#Sanskrit|धर्म]]) in the [[Brahmi script]], as inscribed by Emperor [[Ashoka]] in his [[Edicts of Ashoka]] (3rd century BCE).]]
The [[Classical Sanskrit]] noun ''dharma'' ([[wikt:धर्म#Sanskrit|धर्म]]) or the [[Prakrit]] Dhaṃma ([[wikt:𑀥𑀁𑀫|𑀥𑀁𑀫]]) are a derivation from the root ''dhṛ'', which means "to hold, maintain, keep",{{refn|group=note|name="Monier Williams"|Monier Williams, ''A Sanskrit Dictionary'' (1899): "to hold , bear (also bring forth) , carry , maintain , preserve, keep , possess , have , use , employ , practise , undergo"&lt;ref&gt;Monier Willams.&lt;/ref&gt;}} and takes a meaning of "what is established or firm", and hence "law". It is derived from an older [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''n''-stem ''dharman-'', with a literal meaning of "bearer, supporter", in a [[Historical Vedic religion|religious sense]]  conceived as an aspect of [[Rta]].{{sfn|Day|1982|pp=42–45}}

In the [[Rigveda]], the word appears as an ''n''-stem, ''{{IAST|dhárman-}}'', with a range of meanings encompassing "something established or firm" (in the literal sense of prods or poles). Figuratively, it means "sustainer" and "supporter" (of deities). It is semantically similar to the Greek ''[[Themis]]'' ("fixed decree, statute, law").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brereton|first=Joel P.|date=December 2004|title=Dhárman In The Rgveda|journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy|language=English|volume=32|issue=5–6|pages=449–489|doi=10.1007/s10781-004-8631-8|issn=0022-1791|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Classical Sanskrit]], the noun becomes thematic: ''{{IAST|dharma-}}''.

The word ''dharma'' derives from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root 
*''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/dʰer-|*dʰer-]]'' ("to hold"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-first=Helmut |editor-last=Rix |editor-link=Helmut Rix |title=Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben |year=2001 |language=German |page=145 |publisher=Dr. Ludwig Reichert Verlag |edition=2nd |location=Wiesbaden|title-link=Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben }}&lt;/ref&gt; which in Sanskrit is reflected as class-1 root{{clarify|date=January 2018|What is a "class-1 root"? I find no article on that topic and no mention of it in the article about Sanskrit. Does that correspond with the numbering in the "Sonority hierarchy" section of the "Proto-Indo-European root" article?}} ''[[wikt:धरति#Sanskrit|dhṛ]]''. Etymologically it is related to [[Avestan language|Avestan]] dar- ("to hold"), Latin ''[[wikt:firmus#Latin|firmus]]'' ("steadfast, stable, powerful"), Lithuanian ''[[wikt:derėti#Lithuanian|derė́ti]]'' ("to be suited, fit"), Lithuanian ''dermė'' ("agreement")&lt;ref&gt;Karl Brugmann, ''Elements of the Comparative Grammar of the Indo-Germanic languages'',  Volume III, B. Westermann &amp; Co., New York, 1892, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''darna'' ("harmony") and [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''[[wikt:дръжати#Old Church Slavonic|drъžati]]'' ("to hold, possess").
*Classical Sanskrit word ''dharmas'' would formally match with Latin o-stem ''[[wikt:firmus#Latin|firmus]]'' from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''dʰer-mo-s'' "holding", were it not for its historical development from earlier Rigvedic n-stem.

In Classical Sanskrit, and in the [[Vedic Sanskrit]] of the [[Atharvaveda]], the stem is thematic: ''{{IAST|dhárma-}}'' ([[Devanāgarī]]: धर्म). In [[Prakrit]] and [[Pāli]], it is rendered ''dhamma''. In some [[Indo-Aryan languages#Contemporary languages|contemporary Indian languages]] and dialects it alternatively occurs as ''dharm''.

;Ancient translations
When the [[Mauryan Empire|Mauryan Emperor]] [[Ashoka]] wanted in the 3rd century BCE to translate the word "Dharma" (he used [[Prakrit]] word ''[[Dhamma|Dhaṃma]]'') into Greek and Aramaic, he used the Greek word ''[[Eusebeia]]'' (εὐσέβεια,  piety, spiritual maturity, or godliness) in the [[Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription]] and the [[Kandahar Greek Edict of Ashoka|Kandahar Greek Edicts]], and the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word ''Qsyt'' ("Truth") in the [[Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hiltebeitel |first1=Alf |title=Dharma: Its Early History in Law, Religion, and Narrative |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=9780195394238 |pages=36–37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4NF8pYxdvIC&amp;pg=PA36 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Dharma is a concept of central importance in [[Indian philosophy]] and [[Indian religions|religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dhand|first=Arti|date=17 December 2002|title=The Dharma of Ethics, the Ethics of Dharma: Quizzing the Ideals of Hinduism|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9795.00113/abstract|journal=Journal of Religious Ethics|language=en|volume=30|issue=3|page=351|doi=10.1111/1467-9795.00113|issn=1467-9795|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has multiple meanings in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is difficult to provide a single concise definition for ''dharma'', as the word has a long and varied history and straddles a complex set of meanings and interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. B. Van Buitenen, "Dharma and Moksa", ''Philosophy East and West'', Volume 7, Number 1/2 (April–July 1957), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no equivalent single-word synonym for ''dharma'' in western languages.&lt;ref name=lraw&gt;See:

There have been numerous, conflicting attempts to translate ancient Sanskrit literature with the word ''dharma'' into German, English and French. The concept, claims Paul Horsch,&lt;ref name=paulhorsch/&gt; has caused exceptional difficulties for modern commentators and translators. For example, while Grassmann's&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Grassmann, ''Worterbuch zum Rig-veda'' (German Edition), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120816367}}&lt;/ref&gt; translation of Rig-veda identifies seven different meanings of dharma, [[Karl Friedrich Geldner]] in his translation of the Rig-veda employs 20 different translations for dharma, including meanings such as "law", "order", "duty", "custom", "quality", and "model", among others.&lt;ref name=paulhorsch/&gt; However, the word ''dharma'' has become a widely accepted [[loanword]] in English, and is included in all modern unabridged English dictionaries.

The root of the word ''dharma'' is "dhri", which means "to support, hold, or bear". It is the thing that regulates the course of change by not participating in change, but that principle which remains constant.&lt;ref name=stevenrosen&gt;Steven Rosen (2006), ''Essential Hinduism'', Praeger, {{ISBN|0-275-99006-0}}, pp. 34–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Monier-Williams, the widely cited resource for definitions and explanation of Sanskrit words and concepts of Hinduism, offers&lt;ref&gt;see:

Yet, each of these definitions is incomplete, while combination of these translations do not convey the total sense of the word. In common parlance, ''dharma'' means "right way of living" and "path of rightness".&lt;ref name=stevenrosen/&gt;

The meaning of the word ''dharma'' depends on the context, and its meaning has evolved as ideas of Hinduism have developed through history. In the earliest texts and ancient myths of Hinduism, ''dharma'' meant cosmic law, the rules that created the universe from chaos, as well as rituals; in later [[Vedas]], [[Upanishads]], [[Puranas]] and the [[Indian epic poetry|Epics]], the meaning became refined, richer, and more complex, and the word was applied to diverse contexts.&lt;ref name=phph&gt;see:

In certain contexts, ''dharma'' designates human behaviours considered necessary for order of things in the universe, principles that prevent chaos, behaviours and action necessary to all life in nature, society, family as well as at the individual level.&lt;ref name="ODWR-Dharma" /&gt;&lt;ref name=phph/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see:

* ''[[Britannica Concise Encyclopedia]]'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="ODWR-Dharma"}} ''Dharma'' encompasses ideas such as duty, rights, character, vocation, religion, customs and all behaviour considered appropriate, correct or morally upright.&lt;ref&gt;see:

As with ''dharma'', the word ''adharma'' includes and implies many ideas; in common parlance, adharma means that which is against nature, immoral, unethical, wrong or unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;see:

According to the authoritative book ''[[History of Dharmasastra (P.V. Kane)|History of Dharmasastra]]'', in the hymns of the Rigveda the word dharma appears at least fifty-six times, as an adjective or noun. According to Paul Horsch,&lt;ref name=paulhorsch&gt;Horsch, Paul, "From Creation Myth to World Law: the Early History of Dharma", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', December 2004, Volume 32, Issue 5-6, pp. 423–448.&lt;/ref&gt; the word dharma has its origin in the myths of Vedic Hinduism. The Brahman (whom all the gods make up), claim the hymns of the Rig Veda, created the universe from chaos, they hold (dhar-) the earth and sun and stars apart, they support (dhar-) the sky away and distinct from earth, and they stabilise (dhar-) the quaking mountains and plains.&lt;ref name=paulhorsch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RgVeda 6.70.1, 8.41.10, 10.44.8, for secondary source see [[Karl Friedrich Geldner]], Der Rigveda in Auswahl (2 vols.), Stuttgart; and [[Harvard Oriental Series]], 33–36, Bd. 1–3: 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; The gods, mainly [[Indra]], then deliver and hold order from disorder, harmony from chaos, stability from instability – actions recited in the Veda with the root of word dharma.&lt;ref name=phph/&gt; In hymns composed after the mythological verses, the word dharma takes expanded meaning as a cosmic principle and appears in verses independent of gods. It evolves into a concept, claims Paul Horsch,&lt;ref name=paulhorsch/&gt; that has a dynamic functional sense in [[Atharvaveda]] for example, where it becomes the cosmic law that links cause and effect through a subject. Dharma, in these ancient texts, also takes a ritual meaning. The ritual is connected to the cosmic, and "dharmani" is equated to ceremonial devotion to the principles that gods used to create order from disorder, the world from chaos.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Horsch, "From Creation Myth to World Law: the Early History of Dharma", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', December 2004, Volume 32, Issue 5-6, pp. 430–431.&lt;/ref&gt; Past the ritual and cosmic sense of dharma that link the current world to mythical universe, the concept extends to ethical-social sense that links human beings to each other and to other life forms. It is here that dharma as a concept of law emerges in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;P. Thieme, Gedichte aus dem Rig-Veda, Reclam Universal-Bibliothek Nr. 8930, pp. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Horsch, "From Creation Myth to World Law: the Early History of Dharma", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', December 2004, Volume 32, Issue 5-6, pp. 430–432.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dharma and related words are found in the oldest Vedic literature of Hinduism, in later Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, and the Epics; the word dharma also plays a central role in the literature of other Indian religions founded later, such as Buddhism and Jainism.&lt;ref name="phph"/&gt; According to Brereton,&lt;ref name=jbrereton/&gt; ''Dharman'' occurs 63 times in [[Rigveda|Rig-veda]]; in addition, words related to Dharman also appear in Rig-veda, for example once as dharmakrt, 6 times as ''satyadharman'', and once as ''dharmavant'', 4 times as ''dharman'' and twice as ''dhariman''. 

[[Indo-European studies|Indo-European]] parallels for "Dharma" are known, but the only Iranian equivalent is Old Persian ''darmān'' "remedy", the meaning of which is rather removed from [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] ''dhárman'', suggesting that the word "Dharma" did not have a major role in the [[Indo-Iranian period|Indo-Iranian]] period, and was principally developed more recently under the Vedic tradition.&lt;ref name=jbrereton&gt;Joel Brereton (2004), "Dharman in the RgVeda", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'',  Vol. 32, [https://www.academia.edu/5993798/Dh_rman_In_The_Rgveda pp. 449–489]. "There are Indo-European parallels to dhárman (cf. Wennerberg 1981: 95f.), but the only Iranian equivalent is Old Persian darmān ‘remedy’, which has little bearing on Indo-Aryan dhárman. There is thus no evidence that IIr. *dharman was a signiﬁcant culture word during the Indo-Iranian period." (p.449) "The origin of the concept of dharman rests in its formation. It is a Vedic, rather than an Indo-Iranian word, and a more recent coinage than many other key religious terms of the Vedic tradition. Its meaning derives directly from dhr ‘support, uphold, give foundation to’ and therefore ‘foundation’ is a reasonable gloss in most of its attestations." (p.485)&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is thought that the ''[[Daena]]'' of [[Zoroastrianism]], also meaning the "eternal Law" or "religion", is related to Sanskrit "Dharma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morreall |first1=John |last2=Sonn |first2=Tamara |title=The Religion Toolkit: A Complete Guide to Religious Studies |date=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781444343717 |page=324 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aM461tmUDe4C&amp;pg=PT324 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideas in parts overlapping to ''Dharma'' are found in other ancient cultures: such as Chinese [[Tao]], Egyptian [[Maat]], Sumerian [[Me (mythology)|Me]].&lt;ref name="stevenrosen"/&gt;

===Eusebeia and dharma===
&lt;!-- "Merit § Merit-making in Buddhist societies" links here --&gt;
[[File:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|220px|The [[Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription]] is from Indian [[Emperor Asoka]] in 258 BC, and found in [[Afghanistan]]. The inscription renders the word ''Dharma'' in Sanskrit as [[Eusebeia]] in Greek, suggesting ''dharma'' in ancient India meant spiritual maturity, devotion, piety, duty towards and reverence for human community.&lt;ref name=paulhacker/&gt;]]
In mid-20th century, an inscription of the Indian [[Emperor Asoka]] from the year 258 BC was discovered in Afghanistan, the [[Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription]]. This rock inscription contains [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] text. According to [[:de:Paul Hacker|Paul Hacker]],&lt;ref name=paulhacker/&gt; on the rock appears a Greek rendering for the Sanskrit word dharma: the word [[eusebeia]].&lt;ref name=paulhacker&gt;Paul Hacker (1965), "Dharma in Hinduism", ''[[Journal of Indian Philosophy]]'', Volume 34, Issue 5, pp. 479–496 (English translated version by Donald R. Davis (2006)).&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars of Hellenistic Greece explain eusebeia as a complex concept. Eusebia means not only to venerate gods, but also spiritual maturity, a reverential attitude toward life, and includes the right conduct toward one's parents, siblings and children, the right conduct between husband and wife, and the conduct between biologically unrelated people. This rock inscription, concludes Paul Hacker,&lt;ref name=paulhacker/&gt; suggests dharma in India, about 2300 years ago, was a central concept and meant not only religious ideas, but ideas of right, of good, of one's duty toward the human community.&lt;ref&gt;[[Etienne Lamotte]], Bibliotheque du Museon 43, Louvain, 1958, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rta, maya and dharma===
The evolving literature of Hinduism linked ''dharma'' to two other important concepts: ''Ṛta'' and ''Māyā''. [[Ṛta]] in Vedas is the truth and cosmic principle which regulates and coordinates the operation of the universe and everything within it.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Holdrege (2004), "Dharma" in: Mittal &amp; Thursby (Editors) The Hindu World, New York: Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-21527-7}}, pp. 213–248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=koller/&gt; [[Māyā]] in Rig-veda and later literature means illusion, fraud, deception, magic that misleads and creates disorder,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0800/mw__0844.html Māyā] Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, {{ISBN|978-8120603691}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus is contrary to reality, laws and rules that establish order, predictability and harmony. Paul Horsch&lt;ref name=paulhorsch/&gt; suggests Ṛta and dharma are parallel concepts, the former being a cosmic principle, the latter being of moral social sphere; while Māyā and dharma are also analogous concepts, the former being that which corrupts law and moral life, the later being that which strengthens law and moral life.&lt;ref name=koller&gt;Koller, J. M. (1972), "Dharma: an expression of universal order", ''Philosophy East and West'', 22(2), pp. 136–142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Northrop, F. S. C. (1949), "Naturalistic and cultural foundations for a more effective international law", ''Yale Law Journal'', 59, pp. 1430–1441.&lt;/ref&gt;

Day proposes dharma is a manifestation of Ṛta, but suggests Ṛta may have been subsumed into a more complex concept of dharma, as the idea developed in ancient India over time in a nonlinear manner.{{sfn|Day|1982|pp=42–44}} The following verse from the [[Rigveda]] is an example where ''rta'' and dharma are linked:
{{quote|O Indra, lead us on the path of Rta, on the right path over all evils...|[[Mandala 10|RV 10]].133.6}}

==Hinduism==
{{Hinduism small}}
Dharma is an organising principle in Hinduism that applies to human beings in solitude, in their interaction with human beings and nature, as well as between inanimate objects, to all of cosmos and its parts.&lt;ref name=stevenrosen/&gt; It refers to the order and customs which make life and universe possible, and includes behaviours, rituals, rules that govern society, and ethics.&lt;ref name="ODWR-Dharma" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="ODWR-Dharma"}} Hindu dharma includes the religious duties, moral rights and duties of each individual, as well as behaviours that enable social order, right conduct, and those that are virtuous.&lt;ref&gt;"Dharma", ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', 6th Ed. (2013), Columbia University Press, Gale, {{ISBN|978-0787650155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dharma, according to Van Buitenen,&lt;ref name=vanbuitenen&gt;J. A. B. Van Buitenen, "Dharma and Moksa", ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. – Jul., 1957), pp. 33–40&lt;/ref&gt; is that which all existing beings must accept and respect to sustain harmony and order in the world. It is neither the act nor the result, but the natural laws that guide the act and create the result to prevent chaos in the world. It is innate characteristic, that makes the being what it is. It is, claims Van Buitenen, the pursuit and execution of one's nature and true calling, thus playing one's role in cosmic concert. In Hinduism, it is the dharma of the bee to make honey, of cow to give milk, of sun to radiate sunshine, of river to flow.&lt;ref name=vanbuitenen/&gt; In terms of humanity, dharma is the need for, the effect of and essence of service and interconnectedness of all life.&lt;ref name=stevenrosen/&gt;&lt;ref name=paulhacker/&gt;

In Hinduism, ''dharma'' includes two aspects – ''[[sanātana dharma]]'', which is the overall, unchanging and abiding principals of dharma and is not subject to change, and ''[[yuga dharma]]'', which is valid for a [[yuga]], an epoch or age as established by Hindu tradition.

===In Vedas and Upanishads===
The [[Dharma#History|history section]] of this article discusses the development of dharma concept in Vedas. This development continued in the Upanishads and later ancient scripts of Hinduism. In Upanishads, the concept of dharma continues as universal principle of law, order, harmony, and truth. It acts as the regulatory moral principle of the Universe. It is explained as law of righteousness and equated to ''[[satya]]'' (Sanskrit: सत्यं, truth),&lt;ref name=chjo/&gt;&lt;ref name=paulh/&gt; in hymn 1.4.14 of Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, as follows:

{{quote| 
धर्मः तस्माद्धर्मात् परं नास्त्य् अथो अबलीयान् बलीयाँसमाशँसते धर्मेण यथा राज्ञैवम् ।&lt;br&gt;
यो वै स धर्मः सत्यं वै तत् तस्मात्सत्यं वदन्तमाहुर् धर्मं वदतीति धर्मं वा वदन्तँ सत्यं वदतीत्य् एतद्ध्येवैतदुभयं भवति ।।

Nothing is higher than dharma. The weak overcomes the stronger by dharma, as over a king. Truly that dharma is the Truth (''Satya''); Therefore, when a man speaks the Truth, they say, "He speaks the Dharma"; and if he speaks Dharma, they say, "He speaks the Truth!" For both are one.|[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]|1.4.xiv&lt;ref name=chjo&gt;[[Charles Johnston (Theosophist)|Charles Johnston]], The Mukhya Upanishads: Books of Hidden Wisdom, Kshetra, {{ISBN|978-1495946530}}, p. 481, for discussion: pp. 478–505.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=paulh&gt;Horsch, Paul (translated by Jarrod Whitaker), "From Creation Myth to World Law: The early history of Dharma", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', Vol 32, pp. 423–448, (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===In the Epics===
The Hindu religion and philosophy, claims [[Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Sr.|Daniel Ingalls]],&lt;ref&gt;Daniel H. H. Ingalls, "Dharma and Moksa", ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. – Jul., 1957), pp. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; places major emphasis on individual practical morality. In the Sanskrit epics, this concern is omnipresent.

In the Second Book of [[Ramayana]], for example, a peasant asks the King to do what dharma morally requires of him, the King agrees and does so even though his compliance with the law of dharma costs him dearly. Similarly, dharma is at the centre of all major events in the life of Rama, Sita, and Lakshman in Ramayana, claims Daniel Ingalls.&lt;ref name=danielingalls&gt;Daniel H. H. Ingalls, "Dharma and Moksa", ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (April – July 1957), pp. 41–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Each episode of Ramayana presents life situations and ethical questions in symbolic terms. The issue is debated by the characters, finally the right prevails over wrong, the good over evil. For this reason, in Hindu Epics, the good, morally upright, law-abiding king is referred to as "dharmaraja".&lt;ref&gt;The Mahābhārata: Book 11: The Book of the Women; Book 12: The Book of Peace, Part 1 By Johannes Adrianus Bernardus Buitenen, James L. Fitzgerald p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mahabharata]], the other major Indian epic, similarly, dharma is central, and it is presented with symbolism and metaphors. Near the end of the epic, the god Yama, referred to as dharma in the text, is portrayed as taking the form of a dog to test the compassion of Yudishthira, who is told he may not enter paradise with such an animal, but refuses to abandon his companion, for which decision he is then praised by dharma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m17/m17003.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 17: Mahaprasthanika Parva: Section 3|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value and appeal of the Mahabharata is not as much in its complex and rushed presentation of metaphysics in the 12th book, claims Ingalls,&lt;ref name=danielingalls/&gt; because Indian metaphysics is more eloquently presented in other Sanskrit scriptures; the appeal of Mahabharata, like Ramayana, is in its presentation of a series of moral problems and life situations, to which there are usually three answers given, according to Ingalls:&lt;ref name=danielingalls/&gt; one answer is of [[Bhima]], which is the answer of brute force, an individual angle representing materialism, egoism, and self; the second answer is of [[Yudhishthira]], which is always an appeal to piety and gods, of social virtue and of tradition; the third answer is of introspective [[Arjuna]], which falls between the two extremes, and who, claims Ingalls, symbolically reveals the finest moral qualities of man. The Epics of Hinduism are a symbolic treatise about life, virtues, customs, morals, ethics, law, and other aspects of dharma.&lt;ref&gt;There is considerable amount of literature on dharma-related discussion in Hindu Epics: of Egoism versus Altruism, Individualism versus Social Virtues and Tradition; for examples, see:
* Johann Jakob Meyer (1989), Sexual life in ancient India, {{ISBN|8120806387}}, Motilal Banarsidass, pp. 92–93; Quote – "In Indian literature, especially in Mahabharata over and over again is heard the energetic cry – Each is alone. None belongs to anyone else, we are all but strangers to strangers; (...), none knows the other, the self belongs only to self. Man is born alone, alone he lives, alone he dies, alone he tastes the fruit of his deeds and his ways, it is only his work that bears him company. (...) Our body and spiritual organism is ever changing; what belongs, then, to us? (...) Thus, too, there is really no teacher or leader for anyone, each is his own Guru, and must go along the road to happiness alone. Only the self is the friend of man, only the self is the foe of man; from others nothing comes to him. Therefore what must be done is to honor, to assert one's self..."; Quote – "(in parts of the epic), the most thoroughgoing egoism and individualism is stressed..."
* Raymond F. Piper (1954), "In Support of Altruism in Hinduism", ''Journal of Bible and Religion'', Vol. 22, No. 3 (Jul., 1954), pp. 178–183
* J Ganeri (2010), A Return to the Self: Indians and Greeks on Life as Art and Philosophical Therapy, Royal Institute of Philosophy supplement, 85(66), pp. 119–135.&lt;/ref&gt; There is extensive discussion of dharma at the individual level in the Epics of Hinduism, observes [[Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Sr.|Ingalls]]; for example, on free will versus destiny, when and why human beings believe in either, ultimately concluding that the strong and prosperous naturally uphold free will, while those facing grief or frustration naturally lean towards destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel H. H. Ingalls, "Dharma and Moksa", ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. – Jul., 1957), pp. 44–45; Quote – "(...)In the Epic, free will has the upper hand. Only when a man's effort is frustrated or when he is overcome with grief does he become a predestinarian (believer in destiny)."; Quote – "This association of success with the doctrine of free will or human effort (purusakara) was felt so clearly that among the ways of bringing about a king's downfall is given the following simple advice: 'Belittle free will to him, and emphasise destiny.{{'"}} (Mahabharata 12.106.20).&lt;/ref&gt; The Epics of Hinduism illustrate various aspects of dharma, they are a means of communicating dharma with metaphors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Huston Smith]], The World Religions, {{ISBN|978-0061660184}}, HarperOne (2009); For summary notes: [http://staff.gps.edu/montgomery/World%20Religions/Faiths/hinduism/Background%20to%20Hindu%20Literature.htm Background to Hindu Literature] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040922160422/http://staff.gps.edu/montgomery/World%20Religions/Faiths/hinduism/Background%20to%20Hindu%20Literature.htm |date=2004-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===According to 4th century Vatsyayana===
According to [[Klaus Klostermaier]], 4th century Hindu scholar [[Vātsyāyana]] explained dharma by contrasting it with adharma.&lt;ref name=klausk&gt;Klaus Klostermaier, A survey of Hinduism, SUNY Press, {{ISBN|0-88706-807-3}}, Chapter 3: "Hindu dharma".&lt;/ref&gt; Vātsyāyana suggested that dharma is not merely in one's actions, but also in words one speaks or writes, and in thought. According to Vātsyāyana:&lt;ref name=klausk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jha, Nyayasutras with Vatsyayana Bhasya, 2 vols, Oriental Books (1939).&lt;/ref&gt;

# Adharma of body: hinsa (violence), steya (steal, theft), pratisiddha maithuna (sexual indulgence with someone other than one's partner)
# Dharma of body: dana (charity), paritrana (succor of the distressed) and paricarana (rendering service to others)
# Adharma from words one speaks or writes: mithya (falsehood), parusa (caustic talk), sucana (calumny) and asambaddha (absurd talk)
# Dharma from words one speaks or writes: satya (truth and facts), hitavacana (talking with good intention), priyavacana (gentle, kind talk), svadhyaya (self study)
# Adharma of mind: paradroha (ill will to anyone), paradravyabhipsa (covetousness), nastikya (denial of the existence of morals and religiosity)
# Dharma of mind: daya (compassion), asprha (disinterestedness), and sraddha (faith in others)

===According to Patanjali Yoga===
In the Yoga system the dharma is real; in the Vedanta it is unreal.&lt;ref name="The yoga-system of Patanjali"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft The yoga-system of Patanjali] The ancient Hindu doctrine of concentration of mind, embracing the mnemonic rules, called Yoga-sutras, James Haughton Woods (1914), Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Dharma is part of [[yoga]], suggests Patanjali; the elements of Hindu dharma are the attributes, qualities and aspects of yoga.&lt;ref name="The yoga-system of Patanjali"/&gt; Patanjali explained dharma in two categories: ''yama'' (restraints) and ''niyama'' (observances).&lt;ref name=klausk/&gt;

The five yama, according to Patanjali, are: abstain from injury to all living creatures ([[ahimsa]]), abstain from falsehood (satya), abstain from unauthorised appropriation of things-of-value from another (acastrapurvaka), abstain from coveting or sexually cheating on your partner, and abstain from expecting or accepting gifts from others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft The yoga-system of Patanjali] Yoga-sutras, James Haughton Woods (1914), Harvard University Press, pp. 178–180.&lt;/ref&gt; The five yama apply in action, speech and mind. In explaining yama, Patanjali clarifies that certain professions and situations may require qualification in conduct. For example, a fisherman must injure a fish, but he must attempt to do this with least trauma to fish and the fisherman must try to injure no other creature as he fishes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft The yoga-system of Patanjali] Yoga-sutras, James Haughton Woods (1914), Harvard University Press, pp. 180–181.&lt;/ref&gt;

The five niyama (observances) are cleanliness by eating pure food and removing impure thoughts (such as arrogance or jealousy or pride), contentment in one's means, meditation and silent reflection regardless of circumstances one faces, study and pursuit of historic knowledge, and devotion of all actions to the Supreme Teacher to achieve perfection of concentration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft The yoga-system of Patanjali] Yoga-sutras, James Haughton Woods (1914), Harvard University Press, pp. 181–191.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources===
Dharma is an empirical and experiential inquiry for every man and woman, according to some texts of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=paulhacker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kumarila, Tantravarttika, Anandasramasamskrtagranthavalih, Vol. 97, pp. 204–205; For an English Translation, see Jha (1924), Bibliotheca Indica, Vol. 161, Vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Apastamba|Apastamba Dharmasutra]] states:

{{quote| ''Dharma'' and ''Adharma'' do not go around saying, "That is us." Neither do gods, nor gandharvas, nor ancestors declare what is ''Dharma'' and what is ''Adharma''.| ''Apastamba Dharmasutra''&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Olivelle|Olivelle, Patrick]]. ''Dharmasūtras: The Law Codes of Ancient India''. Oxford World Classics, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other texts, three sources and means to discover dharma in Hinduism are described. These, according to [[:de:Paul Hacker|Paul Hacker]], are:&lt;ref name=ph79/&gt; First, learning historical knowledge such as Vedas, Upanishads, the Epics and other Sanskrit literature with the help of one's teacher. Second, observing the behavior and example of good people. The third source applies when neither one's education nor example exemplary conduct is known. In this case, "[[atmatusti]]" is the source of dharma in Hinduism, that is the good person reflects and follows what satisfies his heart, his own inner feeling, what he feels driven to.&lt;ref name=ph79&gt;Paul Hacker (1965), "Dharma in Hinduism", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', Volume 34, Issue 5, pp. 487–489 (English translated version by Donald R. Davis (2006)).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dharma, life stages and social stratification===
{{main article|Ashrama (stage)|Puruṣārtha|l1=Āśrama}}
Some texts of Hinduism outline ''dharma'' for society and at the individual level. Of these, the most cited one is ''[[Manusmriti]]'', which describes the four ''Varnas'', their rights and duties.&lt;ref name=alfh&gt;[[Alf Hiltebeitel]] (2011), ''Dharma: Its Early History in Law, Religion, and Narrative'', {{ISBN|978-0195394238}}, Oxford University Press, pp. 215–227.&lt;/ref&gt; Most texts of Hinduism, however, discuss ''dharma'' with no mention of ''Varna'' ([[Caste system in India|caste]]).&lt;ref&gt;Thapar, R. (1995), The first millennium BC in northern India, Recent perspectives of early Indian history, 80–141.&lt;/ref&gt; Other dharma texts and Smritis differ from Manusmriti on the nature and structure of Varnas.&lt;ref name=alfh/&gt; Yet, other texts question the very existence of varna. [[Bhrigu]], in the Epics, for example, presents the theory that dharma does not require any varnas.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas R. Trautmann (1964), "On the Translation of the Term Varna", ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient'', Vol. 7, No. 2 (Jul., 1964), pp. 196–201.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, medieval India is widely believed to be a socially stratified society, with each social strata inheriting a profession and being endogamous. Varna was not absolute in Hindu dharma; individuals had the right to renounce and leave their Varna, as well as their [[Ashrama (stage)|asramas]] of life, in search of moksa.&lt;ref name=alfh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see:
* Van Buitenen, J. A. B. (1957). "Dharma and Moksa". ''Philosophy East and West'', Volume 7, Number 1/2 (April – July 1957), pp. 38–39
* Koller, J. M. (1972), "Dharma: an expression of universal order", ''Philosophy East and West'', 22(2), pp. 131–144.&lt;/ref&gt; While neither Manusmriti nor succeeding Smritis of Hinduism ever use the word varnadharma (that is, the dharma of varnas), or varnasramadharma (that is, the dharma of varnas and asramas), the scholarly commentary on Manusmriti use these words, and thus associate dharma with varna system of India.&lt;ref name=alfh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kane, P.V. (1962), History of Dharmasastra (Ancient and Medieval Religious and Civil Law in India), Volume 1, pp. 2–10.&lt;/ref&gt; In 6th century India, even Buddhist kings called themselves "protectors of varnasramadharma" – that is, dharma of varna and asramas of life.&lt;ref name=alfh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olivelle, P. (1993). ''The Asrama System: The history and hermeneutics of a religious institution'', New York: [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

At the individual level, some texts of Hinduism outline [[Ashrama (stage)|four āśrama]]s, or stages of life as individual's dharma. These are:&lt;ref&gt;Alban G. Widgery, "The Principles of Hindu Ethics", ''International Journal of Ethics'', Vol. 40, No. 2 (Jan., 1930), pp. 232–245.&lt;/ref&gt; (1) [[Brahmacharya|brahmacārya]], the life of preparation as a student, (2) [[Grihastha|gṛhastha]], the life of the householder with family and other social roles, (3) [[Vanaprastha|vānprastha]] or aranyaka, the life of the forest-dweller, transitioning from worldly occupations to reflection and renunciation, and (4) [[sannyāsa]], the life of giving away all property, becoming a recluse and devotion to moksa, spiritual matters.

The four stages of life complete the four human strivings in life, according to Hinduism.&lt;ref name=jkkpwg/&gt; Dharma enables the individual to satisfy the striving for stability and order, a life that is lawful and harmonious, the striving to do the right thing, be good, be virtuous, earn religious merit, be helpful to others, interact successfully with society. The other three strivings are [[Artha]] – the striving for means of life such as food, shelter, power, security, material wealth, etc.; [[Kama]] – the striving for sex, desire, pleasure, love, emotional fulfillment, etc.; and [[Moksa]] – the striving for spiritual meaning, liberation from life-rebirth cycle, self-realisation in this life, etc. The four stages are neither independent nor exclusionary in Hindu dharma.&lt;ref name=jkkpwg&gt;see:

===Dharma and poverty===
Dharma while being necessary for individual and society, is dependent on poverty and prosperity in a society, according to Hindu dharma scriptures. For example, according to Adam Bowles,&lt;ref name=adambowles&gt;Adam Bowles (2007), Dharma, Disorder, and the Political in Ancient India, Brill's Indological Library (Book 28), {{ISBN|978-9004158153}}, Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] 11.1.6.24 links social prosperity and ''dharma'' through water. Waters come from rains, it claims; when rains are abundant there is prosperity on the earth, and this prosperity enables people to follow Dharma – moral and lawful life. In times of distress, of drought, of poverty, everything suffers including relations between human beings and the human ability to live according to dharma.&lt;ref name=adambowles/&gt;

In Rajadharmaparvan 91.34-8, the relationship between poverty and dharma reaches a full circle. A land with less moral and lawful life suffers distress, and as distress rises it causes more immoral and unlawful life, which further increases distress.&lt;ref name=adambowles/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Derrett, J. D. M. (1959), "Bhu-bharana, bhu-palana, bhu-bhojana: an Indian conundrum", Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, 22, pp. 108–123.&lt;/ref&gt; Those in power must follow the raja dharma (that is, dharma of rulers), because this enables the society and the individual to follow dharma and achieve prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Gonda]], "Ancient Indian Kingship from the Religious Point of View", ''Numen'', Vol. 3, Issue 1 (Jan., 1956), pp. 36–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dharma and law===
{{main article|Hindu law}}
The notion of ''dharma'' as duty or propriety is found in India's ancient legal and religious texts. In Hindu philosophy, justice, social harmony, and happiness requires that people live per dharma. The [[Dharmashastra]] is a record of these guidelines and rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gächter|first=Othmar|title=Anthropos|journal=Anthropos institute|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The available evidence suggest India once had a large collection of dharma related literature (sutras, shastras); four of the sutras survive and these are now referred to as Dharmasutras.&lt;ref name=polivelle/&gt; Along with laws of Manu in Dharmasutras, exist parallel and different compendium of laws, such as the laws of Narada and other ancient scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Davis, Jr., "A Realist View of Hindu Law", ''Ratio Juris''. Vol. 19 No. 3 September 2006, pp. 287–313.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lariviere, Richard W. (2003), The Naradasmrti, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass&lt;/ref&gt; These different and conflicting law books are neither exclusive, nor do they supersede other sources of dharma in Hinduism. These Dharmasutras include instructions on education of the young, their rites of passage, customs, religious rites and rituals, marital rights and obligations, death and ancestral rites, laws and administration of justice, crimes, punishments, rules and types of evidence, duties of a king, as well as morality.&lt;ref name=polivelle&gt;Patrick Olivelle (1999), ''The Dharmasutras: The law codes of ancient India'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-283882-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{anchor|Buddhism}}
{{Buddhism}}
In Buddhism ''dharma'' means cosmic law and order,&lt;ref name="ODWR-Dharma" /&gt; but is also applied to the teachings of the Buddha.&lt;ref name="ODWR-Dharma" /&gt; In [[Buddhist philosophy]], ''dhamma/dharma'' is also the term for "[[phenomena]]".&lt;ref name="david"/&gt; In East Asia, the translation for dharma is [[wiktionary:法|法]], pronounced ''fǎ'' in Mandarin, ''choe ཆོས་'' in Tibetan, ''beop'' in Korean, ''hō'' in Japanese, and ''pháp'' in Vietnamese. However, the term dharma can also be transliterated from its original form.  

===Buddha's teachings===
&lt;!--"Sacca-kiriya" links here. Please adjust link there if this section is removed or renamed. Thanks.--&gt;
For practicing Buddhists, references to "dharma" (''dhamma'' in Pali) particularly as "the Dharma", generally means the teachings of the Buddha, commonly known throughout the East as Buddha-Dharma. It includes especially the discourses on the fundamental principles (such as the [[Four Noble Truths]] and the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]), as opposed to the parables and to the poems.

The status of Dharma is regarded variably by different Buddhist traditions. Some regard it as an ultimate truth, or as the fount of all things which lie beyond the "[[three realms]]" (Sanskrit: ''tridhatu'') and the "wheel of becoming" (Sanskrit: ''[[bhavachakra]]''), somewhat like the pagan Greek and Christian [[logos]]: this is known as ''[[Dharmakaya]]'' (Sanskrit). Others, who regard the Buddha as simply an enlightened human being, see the Dharma as the [[essence]] of the "84,000 different aspects of the teaching" (Tibetan: ''chos-sgo brgyad-khri bzhi strong'') that the Buddha gave to various types of people, based upon their individual propensities and capabilities.

Dharma refers not only to the sayings of the Buddha, but also to the later traditions of interpretation and addition that the various [[schools of Buddhism]] have developed to help explain and to expand upon the Buddha's teachings. For others still, they see the Dharma as referring to the "truth", or the ultimate reality of "the way that things really are" (Tib. Cho).

The Dharma is one of the [[Three Jewels]] of Buddhism in which practitioners of Buddhism seek refuge, or that upon which one relies for his or her lasting happiness. The Three Jewels of Buddhism are the [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], meaning the mind's perfection of enlightenment, the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]], meaning the teachings and the methods of the Buddha, and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], meaning the monastic community who provide guidance and support to followers of the Buddha.

===Chan Buddhism===
Dharma is employed in [[Ch'an]] in a specific context in relation to transmission of authentic doctrine, understanding and bodhi; recognised in [[Dharma transmission]].

==Jainism==
{{Main article|Dharma (Jainism)}}
[[File:Jain Prateek Chihna.svg|thumb|140px|Jainism]]

The word Dharma in Jainism is found in all its key texts. It has a contextual meaning and refers to a number of ideas. In the broadest sense, it means the teachings of the Jinas,&lt;ref name="ODWR-Dharma" /&gt; or teachings of any competing spiritual school,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John E. |last=Cort|title=Jains in the World: Religious Values and Ideology in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PZk-4HOMzsoC&amp;pg=PA192 |year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803037-9|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; a supreme path,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter B.

The term ''dharma'' also has a specific [[ontology|ontological]] and soteriological meaning in Jainism, as a part of its theory of six [[dravya (Jainism)|dravya]] (substance or a reality). In the Jain tradition, existence consists of ''jiva'' (soul, atman) and ''ajiva'' (non-soul), the latter consisting of five categories: inert non-sentient atomic matter (pudgala), space (akasha), time (kala), principle of motion (dharma), and principle of rest (adharma).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John E. |last=Cort|title=Open Boundaries: Jain Communities and Cultures in Indian History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WWfnXbVWjKcC |year=1998|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-3786-5|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dundas2003p93"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas|authorlink=Paul Dundas|title=The Jains|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93 |year=2003|edition=2|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415266055|pages=93–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term ''dharma'' to mean motion and to refer to an ontological sub-category is peculiar to Jainism, and not found in the metaphysics of Buddhism and various schools of Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Dundas2003p93"/&gt;

The major [[Jain text]], ''Tattvartha Sutra'' mentions ''Das-dharma'' with the meaning of "ten righteous virtues". These are forbearance, modesty, straightforwardness, purity, truthfulness, self-restraint, austerity, renunciation, non-attachment, and celibacy.{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=128}} Acārya Amṛtacandra, author of the Jain text, ''Puruṣārthasiddhyupāya'' writes:{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=22}}
{{quote|A right believer should constantly meditate on virtues of dharma, like supreme modesty, in order to protect the soul from all contrary dispositions. He should also cover up the shortcomings of others.|''Puruṣārthasiddhyupāya'' (27)}}

==Sikhism==
[[File:Khanda Orange.jpg|thumb|140px|Sikhism]]
{{main article|Sikhism}}
For [[Sikh]]s, the word ''Dharm'' means the path of righteousness and proper religious practice.&lt;ref name=rinehart138&gt;Rinehart, Robin (2014), in Pashaura Singh, Louis E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8294">An '''economic input-output life-cycle assessment''', or '''EIO-LCA''' involves the use of aggregate sector-level data to quantify the amount of environmental impact that can be directly attributed to each sector of the economy and how much each sector purchases from other sectors in producing its output. Combining such data sets can enable accounting for long chains (for example, building an automobile requires energy, but producing energy requires vehicles, and building those vehicles requires energy, etc.), which somewhat alleviates the scoping problem of traditional [[Life-cycle assessment]]s. EIO-LCA analysis traces out the various economic transactions, resource requirements and environmental emissions (including all the various manufacturing, transportation, mining and related requirements) required for producing a particular product or service.

EIO-LCA relies on sector-level averages that may or may not be representative of the specific subset of the sector relevant to a particular product. To the extent that the good or service of interest is representative of a sector, EIOLCA can provide very fast estimates of full supply chain implications for that good or service.

==Background==
Economic input-output analysis was developed by the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]]-winning economist [[Wassily Leontief]]. It quantifies the interrelationships among sectors of an economic system, enabling identification of direct and indirect economic inputs of purchases. This concept was extended by including data about environmental and energy analysis from each sector to account for [[supply chain]] environmental implications of economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson, C. T., Lave, L. B., and Matthews, H. S. (2005) ''Environmental Life Cycle Assessment of Goods and Services: An Input-Output Approach'', Resources for the Future Press. {{ISBN|978-1-933115-24-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Input-output transactions tables, which track flows of purchases between sectors, are collected by the federal government in the United States. EIO works as follows: If &lt;math&gt;X_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; represents the amount that sector &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; purchased from sector &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in a given year and &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; is the "final demand" for output from sector &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., the amount of output purchased for consumption, as opposed to purchased by other businesses as supplies for more production), then the total output &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; from sector &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; includes output to consumers plus output sold to other sectors:

&lt;math&gt;x_i = y_i + \sum_jX_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

If we define &lt;math&gt;A_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; as the normalized production for each sector, so that &lt;math&gt;A_{ij} = X_{ij}/x_j&lt;/math&gt;, then

&lt;math&gt;x_i = y_i + \sum_jA_{ij}x_j&lt;/math&gt;

In vector notation

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y} + \mathbf{Ax}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y} = (\mathbf{I - A})\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = (\mathbf{I - A})^{-1}\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;

This result indicates that knowing only the final demand from each sector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; and the normalized IO matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, one can calculate the total implied production &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; from each sector of the economy. If data are available on a particular emissions release (or other attribute of interest) from each sector of the economy, then a matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; can be compiled to represent various releases (columns) per $ output from each sector (rows). Total additional emissions &lt;math&gt;\Delta \mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; associated with additional final demand of &lt;math&gt;\Delta \mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; can then be calculated as:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{R}^T\Delta\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{R}^T(\mathbf{I - A})^{-1}\Delta\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;

This simple result enables very quick analysis, taking into account releases associated with the entire supply chain requirements needed to provide a specific final demand, on average. The equations are based on average data in the current economy, but they can be used to make predictions for marginal changes in output (such as one more unit of a particular product) if 
# average output and marginal output are assumed to be sufficiently close (i.e., the impact of ''one more unit'' = the impact of ''the average unit''), and
# the marginal change in final output &lt;math&gt;\Delta \mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; is representative of the product of interest (ex: if the product will use electricity from wind energy exclusively, then using the electricity sector, which is dominated by coal, would yield a poor estimate).

Finally, if the researcher has estimates for valuation of [[externality]] costs associated with each item in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; (or, alternatively, if weighting coefficients are available that represent the relative importance of each item in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;, using [[ecological indicator]]s, for example) then the externality costs (or weights) per unit of releases could be compiled into a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{m}&lt;/math&gt; in order to calculate the scalar "environmental impact metric" &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta m = \mathbf{m}^T\Delta\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{m}^T\mathbf{R}^T\Delta\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{m}^T\mathbf{R}^T(\mathbf{I - A})^{-1}\Delta\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;

Generally there is wide uncertainty associated with estimates of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{m}&lt;/math&gt;, so such aggregation should be done only with care, including [[sensitivity analysis]]. Typically, researchers examine specific elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; rather than attempting to aggregate.

The big picture result is that by collecting data on average economic sector transactions &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and average sector emissions &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;, it is possible to make quick predictions about the full supply chain emissions associated with a product of interest by representing the product as marginal changes in production from relevant sectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Software==
Researchers at the Green Design Institute of [[Carnegie Mellon University]] began developing a web-based tool for performing an EIO-LCA in the 1990s.  The underlying software&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eiolca.net www.eiolca.net]&lt;/ref&gt; traces out the various economic transactions, resource requirements and environmental emissions associated with the production of a particular product or service. The model captures all the various manufacturing, transportation, mining and related requirements to produce a product or service. For example, one might wish to trace out the implications of purchasing $ 46,000 of reinforcing steel and $ 104,000 of concrete for a kilometer of roadway pavement. Environmental implications of these purchases can be estimated using EIO-LCA. The current (2002) model is based upon the Department of Commerce's 428 sector industry input-output model of the US economy.

In 2018, VitalMetrics Group, an environmental consultancy, developed a web-based Spend Analysis Tool&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vitalmetricsgroup.com/sustainability-tools/ www.vitalmetricsgroup.com/sustainability-tools/]&lt;/ref&gt; for quantifying the environmental impacts associated with an organization’s entire upstream supply chain. It is compliant with the approach for quantifying spend-based impacts defined in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain Accounting and Reporting Standard. The tool utilizes the Comprehensive Environmental Data Archive (CEDA)&lt;ref&gt;Suh, S., 2005: Developing Sectoral Environmental Database for Input-Output Analysis: Comprehensive Environmental Data Archive of the U.S., Economic Systems Research, 17 (4), 449 – 469] https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09535310500284326&lt;/ref&gt;, a peer-reviewed EIO-LCA database with a base year of 2014. CEDA represents 389 industrial sectors, the commodities and the linkages between them, and over 2,700 environmental exchanges arising from them, including extraction of various natural resources, water consumption, land use, and emissions to air, water and soil.

In [[political theory|political]] and [[sociology|sociological]] theory, the '''elite''' (French ''élite'', from [[Latin]] ''eligere'') are a small group of powerful people who hold a [[economic inequality|disproportionate amount of wealth]], [[privilege (social inequality)|privilege]], [[political power]], or skill in a society.

==Elitist privilege==
According to Mills, men receive the education necessary for [[elitism|elitist]] privilege to obtain their background and contacts, allowing them to enter three branches of the power elite, which are;
*The Political Leadership: Mills contended that since the end of [[World War II]], corporate leaders had become more prominent in the political process, with a decline in central decision-making for professional politicians. 
*The Military Circle: In Mills' time a heightened concern about warfare existed, making top military leaders and such issues as defense funding and personnel recruitment very important. Most prominent corporate leaders and politicians were strong proponents of military spending. 
*The Corporate Elite: According to Mills, in the 1950s when the military emphasis was pronounced, it was corporate leaders working with prominent military officers who dominated the development of policies. These two groups tended to be mutually supportive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doob|first=Christopher|title=Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society|year=2013|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-205-79241-2|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mills|first=Charles W.|title=The Power Elite|year=1956|pages=274–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mills, the governing elite in the United States primarily draws its members from political leaders, including the president, and a handful of key cabinet members, as well as close advisers, major corporate owners and directors, and high-ranking military officers.&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Power elite|editor=Ritzer, George |editor2=Ryan, J. Michael|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Sociology|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4051-8353-6|page=466|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz4wU64f_JYC&amp;pg=PA466|author1=Powell, Jason L.  |author2=Chamberlain, John M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups overlap and elites tend to circulate from one sector to another, consolidating power in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Jason L. (2007) "power elite" in George Ritzer (ed.) ''The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology'',  Blackwell Publishing, 2007, pp. 3602-3603&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the [[ruling class]], a social formation based on heritage and social ties, the power elite is characterized by the organizational structures through which its wealth is acquired. According to Mills, the power elite rose from "the managerial reorganization of the propertied classes into the more or less unified stratum of the corporate rich".&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Wright Mills|Mills, Charles W]]. ''The Power Elite'', p 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Domhoff further clarified the differences in the two terms: "The upper class as a whole does not do the ruling. Instead, class rule is manifested through the activities of a wide variety of organizations and institutions...Leaders within the upper class join with high-level employees in the organizations they control to make up what will be called the power elite".&lt;ref&gt;[[G. William Domhoff|Domhoff, William G]], ''Who Rules America Now?'' (1997), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Marxist]] theoretician [[Nikolai Bukharin]] anticipated the [[elite theory]] in his 1929 work, ''Imperialism and World Economy'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kevin|first1=Carson|title=Kevin Carson Wikipedia|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Carson}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=December 2017}} "present-day state power is nothing but an entrepreneurs' company of tremendous power, headed even by the same persons that occupy the leading positions in the banking and syndicate offices".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolai Bukharin|Bukharin, Nikolai]]. ''Imperialism and World Economy'' (1929)
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Power elite ==
The ''power elite'' is a term used by American sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]] to describe a relatively small, loosely connected group of individuals who dominate American policy making. This group includes bureaucratic, corporate, intellectual, military, [[media mogul|media]], and government elites who control the principal institutions in the United States and whose opinions and actions influence the decisions of the policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;power elite. (n.d.). The American Heritage® New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy, Third Edition. Retrieved January 18, 2015, from Dictionary.com website: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/power%20elite&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis for membership of a power elite is institutional power, namely an influential position within a prominent private or public organization.&lt;ref name="Doob 2013 38" /&gt; A study of the French corporate elite has shown that social class continues to hold sway in determining who joins this elite group, with those from the upper-middle class tending to dominate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maclean|first=Mairi|last2=Harvey|first2=Charles|last3=Kling|first3=Gerhard|date=2014-06-01|title=Pathways to Power: Class, Hyper-Agency and the French Corporate Elite|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0170840613509919|journal=Organization Studies|language=en|volume=35|issue=6|pages=825–855|doi=10.1177/0170840613509919|issn=0170-8406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study (published in 2002) of power elites in the United States under President [[George W. Bush]] (in office 2001-2009) identified 7,314 institutional positions of power encompassing 5,778 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dye|first=Thomas
|title= Who's Running America? The Bush Restoration, 7th edition
| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0-ntAAAAMAAJ
| year= 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later study of U.S. society noted demographic characteristics of this elite group as follows:

; '''Age''' : Corporate leaders aged about 60; heads of [[foundation (nonprofit)|foundations]], law, education, and civic organizations aged around 62; government employees aged about 56.
; '''Gender''' : Men contribute roughly 80% in the political realm whereas women contribute roughly only 20% in the political realm. In the economic denomination, {{as of|October 2017|lc=on}}, only 32 (6.4%) of the fortune 500 CEOs are women.&lt;ref name="Fortune 500"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fortune 500 list|url=http://beta.fortune.com/fortune500/list|website=Fortune|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; '''Ethnicity''' : [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|White Anglo-Saxons]] dominate in the power elite, with [[Protestants]] representing about 80% of the top business leaders, and about 73% of members of Congress. {{as of|October 2017}}, only 4 of the fortune 500 CEOs are African American.&lt;ref name="Fortune 500" /&gt; In similarly low proportions, {{as of|October 2017|lc=on}}, 10 of the fortune 500 CEOs are [[Latino]], and 2% are Asian.&lt;ref name="Fortune 500" /&gt;
; '''Education''' : Nearly all the leaders have a college education, with almost half graduating with advanced degrees. About 54% of the big-business leaders, and 42% of the government elite graduated from just 12 prestigious [[universities]] with large [[Endowment fund|endowments]].
; '''Social clubs''' : Most holders of top positions in the power elite possess exclusive membership to one or more [[social clubs]]. About a third belong to a small number of especially prestigious clubs in major cities like [[London]], [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], [[Boston]], and [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impacts on economy==

In the 1970s an organized set of policies promoted reduced [[tax]]es, especially for the wealthy, and a steady erosion of the welfare safety net.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins and Eckert 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with legislation in the 1980s, the wealthy banking community successfully lobbied for reduced regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Francis 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wide range of financial and social capital accessible to the power elite gives their members heavy influence in economic and political decision making, allowing them to move toward attaining desired outcomes. Sociologist Christopher Doob gives a hypothetical alternative, stating that these elite individuals would consider themselves the overseers of the national economy. Also appreciating that it is not only a moral, but a practical necessity to focus beyond their group interests. Doing so would hopefully alleviate various destructive conditions affecting large numbers of less affluent citizens.&lt;ref name="Doob 2013 38"/&gt;

==Global politics and hegemony==
Mills determined that there is an "inner core" of the power elite involving individuals that are able to move from one seat of institutional power to another. They therefore, have a wide range of knowledge and interests in many influential organizations, and are, as Mills describes, "professional go-betweens of economic, political, and military affairs".&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Wright Mills|Mills, Charles W]]. ''The Power Elite'', p 288.&lt;/ref&gt; Relentless expansion of [[capitalism]] and the globalizing of economic and military power, binds leaders of the power elite into complex relationships with [[nation states]] that generate global-scale class divisions. Sociologist [[Manuel Castells]] writes in ''[[The Rise of the Network Society]]'' that contemporary globalization does not mean that "everything in the global economy is global".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castells|first=Manuel|title=The Rise of the Network Society|year=1996|publisher=Blackwell Publishers Ltd.|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-1557866172|pages=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, a global economy becomes characterized by fundamental social inequalities with respect to the "level of integration, competitive potential and share of the benefits from economic growth".&lt;ref name="CastellsManuel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Castells|first=Manuel|title=The Rise of the Network Society|year=1996|publisher=Blackwell Publishers Ltd.|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-1557866172|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castells cites a kind of "double movement"  where on one hand, "valuable segments of territories and people" become "linked in the global networks of value making and wealth appropriation", while, on the other, "everything and everyone" that is not valued by established networks gets "switched off...and ultimately discarded".&lt;ref name="CastellsManuel" /&gt; The wide-ranging effects of [[global capitalism]] ultimately affect everyone on the planet, as economies around the world come to depend on the functioning of global financial markets, technologies, trade and labor.

In [[category theory]], an abstract branch of [[mathematics]], an '''equivalence of categories''' is a relation between two [[Category (mathematics)|categories]] that establishes that these categories are "essentially the same". There are numerous examples of categorical equivalences from many areas of mathematics. Establishing an equivalence involves demonstrating strong similarities between the mathematical structures concerned. In some cases, these structures may appear to be unrelated at a superficial or intuitive level, making the notion fairly powerful: it creates the opportunity to "translate" theorems between different kinds of mathematical structures, knowing that the essential meaning of those theorems is preserved under the translation.

If a category is equivalent to the [[dual (category theory)|opposite (or dual)]] of another category then one speaks of
a '''duality of categories''', and says that the two categories are '''dually equivalent'''.

An equivalence of categories consists of a [[functor]] between the involved categories, which is required to have an "inverse" functor. However, in contrast to the situation common for [[isomorphism]]s in an algebraic setting, the composition of the functor and its "inverse" is not necessarily the identity mapping. Instead it is sufficient that each object be ''[[natural transformation|naturally isomorphic]]'' to its image under this composition. Thus one may describe the functors as being "inverse up to isomorphism". There is indeed a concept of [[isomorphism of categories]] where a strict form of inverse functor is required, but this is of much less practical use than the ''equivalence'' concept.

==Definition==
Formally, given two categories ''C'' and ''D'', an ''equivalence of categories'' consists of a functor ''F'' : ''C'' → ''D'', a functor ''G'' : ''D'' → ''C'', and two natural isomorphisms ε: ''FG''→'''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; and η : '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;→''GF''. Here ''FG'': ''D''→''D'' and ''GF'': ''C''→''C'', denote the respective compositions of ''F'' and ''G'', and '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''C''→''C'' and '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''D''→''D'' denote the ''identity functors'' on ''C'' and ''D'', assigning each object and morphism to itself. If ''F'' and ''G'' are contravariant functors one speaks of a ''duality of categories'' instead.

One often does not specify all the above data. For instance, we say that the categories ''C'' and ''D'' are ''equivalent'' (respectively ''dually equivalent'') if there exists an equivalence (respectively duality) between them. Furthermore, we say that ''F'' "is" an equivalence of categories if an inverse functor ''G'' and natural isomorphisms as above exist. Note however that knowledge of ''F'' is usually not enough to reconstruct ''G'' and the natural isomorphisms: there may be many choices (see example below).

==Equivalent characterizations==
A functor ''F'' : ''C'' → ''D'' yields an equivalence of categories if and only if it is simultaneously:
* [[full functor|full]], i.e. for any two objects ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of ''C'', the map Hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) → Hom&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;(''Fc''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''Fc''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) induced by ''F'' is [[surjective]];
* [[faithful functor|faithful]], i.e. for any two objects ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of ''C'', the map Hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) → Hom&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;(''Fc''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''Fc''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) induced by ''F'' is [[injective]]; and
* [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective (dense)]], i.e. each object ''d'' in ''D'' is isomorphic to an object of the form ''Fc'', for ''c'' in ''C''.
This is a quite useful and commonly applied criterion, because one does not have to explicitly construct the "inverse" ''G'' and the natural isomorphisms between ''FG'', ''GF'' and the identity functors. On the other hand, though the above properties guarantee the ''existence'' of a categorical equivalence (given a sufficiently strong version of the [[axiom of choice]] in the underlying set theory), the missing data is not completely specified, and often there are many choices. It is a good idea to specify the missing constructions explicitly whenever possible.
Due to this circumstance, a functor with these properties is sometimes called a '''weak equivalence of categories'''. (Unfortunately this conflicts with terminology from [[homotopy type theory]].)

There is also a close relation to the concept of [[adjoint functors]]. The following statements are equivalent for functors ''F'' : ''C'' → ''D'' and ''G'' : ''D'' → ''C'':
* There are natural isomorphisms from ''FG'' to '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt; to ''GF''.
* ''F'' is a left adjoint of ''G'' and both functors are full and faithful.
* ''G'' is a right adjoint of ''F'' and both functors are full and faithful.
One may therefore view an adjointness relation between two functors as a "very weak form of equivalence". Assuming that the natural transformations for the adjunctions are given, all of these formulations allow for an explicit construction of the necessary data, and no choice principles are needed. The key property that one has to prove here is that the ''counit'' of an adjunction is an isomorphism if and only if the right adjoint is a full and faithful functor.

==Examples==
* Consider the category &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; having a single object &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and a single morphism &lt;math&gt;1_{c}&lt;/math&gt;, and the category &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; with two objects &lt;math&gt;d_{1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; and four morphisms: two identity morphisms &lt;math&gt;1_{d_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;1_{d_{2}}&lt;/math&gt; and two isomorphisms &lt;math&gt;\alpha \colon d_{1} \to d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta \colon d_{2} \to d_{1}&lt;/math&gt;.  The categories &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent; we can (for example) have &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; map &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;d_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; map both objects of &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and all morphisms to &lt;math&gt;1_{c}&lt;/math&gt;.
* By contrast, the category &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; with a single object and a single morphism is ''not'' equivalent to the category &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; with two objects and only two identity morphisms as the two objects therein are ''not'' isomorphic.
* Consider a category &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; with one object &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, and two morphisms &lt;math&gt;1_{c}, f \colon c \to c&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;1_{c}&lt;/math&gt; be the identity morphism on &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and set &lt;math&gt;f \circ f = 1&lt;/math&gt;.  Of course, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to itself, which can be shown by taking &lt;math&gt;1_{c}&lt;/math&gt; in place of the required natural isomorphisms between the functor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}_{C}&lt;/math&gt; and itself.  However, it is also true that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; yields a natural isomorphism from &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}_{C}&lt;/math&gt; to itself.  Hence, given the information that the identity functors form an equivalence of categories, in this example one still can choose between two natural isomorphisms for each direction.
* The category of sets and [[partial function]]s is equivalent to but not isomorphic with the category of [[pointed set]]s and point-preserving maps.&lt;ref name="KoslowskiMelton2001"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Jürgen Koslowski and Austin Melton|title=Categorical Perspectives|year=2001|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-8176-4186-3|page=10|author=Lutz Schröder|chapter=Categories: a free tour}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Consider the category &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of finite-[[dimension of a vector space|dimensional]] [[real number|real]] [[vector space]]s, and the category &lt;math&gt;D = \mathrm{Mat}(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; of all real [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] (the latter category is explained in the article on [[additive category|additive categories]]).  Then &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent: The functor &lt;math&gt;G \colon D \to C&lt;/math&gt; which maps the object &lt;math&gt;A_{n}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; to the vector space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; and the matrices in &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; to the corresponding linear maps is full, faithful and essentially surjective.
* One of the central themes of [[algebraic geometry]] is the duality of the category of [[affine scheme]]s and the category of [[commutative ring]]s.  The functor &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; associates to every commutative ring its [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]], the scheme defined by the [[prime ideal]]s of the ring.  Its adjoint &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; associates to every affine scheme its ring of global sections.
* In [[functional analysis]] the category of commutative [[C*-algebra]]s with identity is contravariantly equivalent to the category of [[compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]]s.  Under this duality, every compact Hausdorff space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is associated with the algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and every commutative C*-algebra is associated with the space of its [[maximal ideal]]s.  This is the [[Gelfand representation]].
* In [[lattice theory]], there are a number of dualities, based on representation theorems that connect certain classes of lattices to classes of [[topology|topological spaces]].  Probably the most well-known theorem of this kind is ''[[Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras]]'', which is a special instance within the general scheme of ''[[Stone duality]]''.  Each [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is mapped to a specific topology on the set of [[lattice theory|ultrafilters]] of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.  Conversely, for any topology the clopen (i.e. closed and open) subsets yield a Boolean algebra.  One obtains a duality between the category of Boolean algebras (with their homomorphisms) and [[Stone space]]s (with continuous mappings). Another case of Stone duality is [[Birkhoff's representation theorem]] stating a duality between finite partial orders and finite distributive lattices.
* In [[pointless topology]] the category of spatial locales is known to be equivalent to the dual of the category of sober spaces.
* For two [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]] ''R'' and ''S'', the [[product category]] ''R''-'''Mod'''×''S''-'''Mod''' is equivalent to (''R''×''S'')-'''Mod'''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* Any category is equivalent to its [[skeleton (category theory)|skeleton]].

==Properties==
As a rule of thumb, an equivalence of categories preserves all "categorical" concepts and properties. If ''F'' : ''C'' → ''D'' is an equivalence, then the following statements are all true:
* the object ''c'' of ''C'' is an [[initial object]] (or [[terminal object]], or [[zero object]]), [[if and only if]] ''Fc'' is an [[initial object]] (or [[terminal object]], or [[zero object]]) of ''D''
* the morphism α in ''C'' is a [[monomorphism]] (or [[epimorphism]], or [[isomorphism]]), if and only if ''Fα'' is a monomorphism (or epimorphism, or isomorphism) in ''D''.
* the functor ''H'' : ''I'' → ''C'' has [[limit (category theory)|limit]] (or colimit) ''l'' if and only if the functor ''FH'' : ''I'' → ''D'' has limit (or colimit) ''Fl''. This can be applied to [[equaliser (mathematics)|equalizers]], [[product (category theory)|product]]s and [[coproduct]]s among others. Applying it to [[kernel (category theory)|kernel]]s and [[cokernel]]s, we see that the equivalence ''F'' is an [[Regular category#Exact sequences and regular functors|exact functor]].
* ''C'' is a [[cartesian closed category]] (or a [[topos]]) if and only if ''D'' is cartesian closed (or a topos).

Dualities "turn all concepts around": they turn initial objects into terminal objects, monomorphisms into epimorphisms, kernels into cokernels, limits into colimits etc.

If ''F'' : ''C'' → ''D'' is an equivalence of categories, and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are two inverses of ''F'', then ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are naturally isomorphic.

If ''F'' : ''C'' → ''D'' is an equivalence of categories, and if ''C'' is a [[preadditive category]] (or [[additive category]], or [[abelian category]]), then ''D'' may be turned into a preadditive category (or additive category, or abelian category) in such a way that ''F'' becomes an [[additive functor]]. On the other hand, any equivalence between additive categories is necessarily additive. (Note that the latter statement is not true for equivalences between preadditive categories.)

An '''auto-equivalence''' of a category ''C'' is an equivalence ''F'' : ''C'' → ''C''. The auto-equivalences of ''C'' form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under composition if we consider two auto-equivalences that are naturally isomorphic to be identical. This group captures the essential "symmetries" of ''C''. (One caveat: if ''C'' is not a small category, then the auto-equivalences of ''C'' may form a proper [[class (set theory)|class]] rather than a [[Set (mathematics)|set]].)

The '''principal of generic views''' in the study of [[cognition]] stipulates that the interpretation made by an observer of a distal phenomenon should be such as to not require that the observer be in a special position to,  or relationship with, the phenomenon in question.  The principal is a fairly general account of the inductive bias that allows an observer to reconstruct distal phenomena from an impoverished proximal datum.  This principle has been advanced particularly in vision research as an account of how, for example, three-dimensional structure is extracted from an inadequate two-dimensional projection.

The principal of generic views has been discussed by Richards&lt;ref&gt;Knill, D. C., &amp; Richards, W., eds., ''Perception as Bayesian Inference'' ([[Cambridge]]: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=tcx-XfmXegUC&amp;pg=PA478 p. 478].&lt;/ref&gt; and Hoffman&lt;ref&gt;Gefter, A., [https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/04/the-illusion-of-reality/479559/ "The Case Against Reality"], ''[[The Atlantic]]'', Apr. 25, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|''Suppose in reality there’s a resource, like water, and you can quantify how much of it there is in an objective order—very little water, medium amount of water, a lot of water. Now suppose your fitness function is linear, so a little water gives you a little fitness, medium water gives you medium fitness, and lots of water gives you lots of fitness—in that case, the organism that sees the truth about the water in the world can win, but only because the fitness function happens to align with the true structure in reality. Generically, in the real world, that will never be the case. Something much more natural is a bell curve—say, too little water you die of thirst, but too much water you drown, and only somewhere in between is good for survival. Now the fitness function doesn’t match the structure in the real world. And that’s enough to send truth to extinction. For example, an organism tuned to fitness might see small and large quantities of some resource as, say, red, to indicate low fitness, whereas they might see intermediate quantities as green, to indicate high fitness. Its perceptions will be tuned to fitness, but not to truth. It won’t see any distinction between small and large—it only sees red—even though such a distinction exists in reality.''—Donald D. Hoffman to Amanda Gefter|group=n}}, and has been given a sophisticated [[Thomas Bayes|Bayesian]] formalization by Freeman{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}.

==Relation to Bayesian inference==
Another expression of the generic views principal is that the inference of distal structure should be such that the inference would remain substantially the same if the "position" of the observer were moderately altered (perturned).  If the inference made would have been qualitatively or categorically different under a perturbation of the observer, then the inference does not satisfy the '''generic views assumption''', and should be rejected.  (The question of what constitutes a qualitative or categorical difference is an interesting point of detail.)  On this view, it can be argued that the principal of generic views is nothing more than an inference based on the maximum [[posterior probability]] (MAP) which accounts for aspects of observation.  Thus, we infer the distal phenomenon which possess the highest probability of having generated the observations in question, and this probability incorporates (in addition to relevant priors) both the likelihood of the distal phenomenon generating certain observable signals, and the likelihood of the observer transducing those signals in a manner consistent with the observations.  On such an analysis (and with various assumptions invoked), one can obtain a behavior approximating the generic views principal.

'''HHole for Mannheim (2006-∞)''' is a permanent multimedia installation in the "Athene-Trakt" of the [[:de:Kunsthalle Mannheim|Kunsthalle Mannheim]]&lt;ref name="Kunsthalle Mannheim 1907-2007"&gt;{{cite book | title=100 Yahre Kunsthalle Mannheim 1907-2007 | publisher=Kunsthalle Mannheim | year=2007 | isbn=978-3-89165-210-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; created by [[NatHalie Braun Barends]].

The Kunsthalle is {{asof|2015}} under reconstruction. Following a court decision of the Landgericht Mannheim, the installation will likely not be rebuilt afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/kunsthalle-muss-mannheimer-loch-nicht-wieder-installieren-13556651.html|title=Landgericht weist Klage ab: Kunsthalle muss „Mannheimer Loch“ nicht wieder installieren|trans-title=|author=|date=24 April 2015|publisher=|access-date=26 January 2017|via=FAZ.NET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Landgericht Mannheim decided that the right of the owner of the building (even if against the signed loan contracts) overrides  the copyright and the property of the artist, to allow the city to build the new €70 millions museum. It is to appreciate that the artist, in order to protect the fundamental right of artistic freedom, property right and copyright will go on to the next instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/kunst-und-architektur/article140084472/Und-ich-sage-dieses-Loch-ist-Kunst.html|title=Mannheimer Loch: Ist es nichts?

== Description ==
HHole for Mannheim (2006-∞) has been conceived as a permanent, conceptual, site specific, developing artwork in progress.&lt;ref name="NatHalie Braun Barends - Light Art Life"&gt;{{cite book | title=NatHalie Braun Barends - Light Art Life | publisher=Art Space | year=2007 | location=Berlin/New York/Santiago | isbn=978-3-941494-00-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It consists of seven holes which pass through the Athene Trakt that unites the old (Billing-Bau) and the new building (Mitzlaff-Bau) of the Mannheim Kunsthalle.

The natural light flows from the topmost hole above the museum rooftop, through the holes in the floors below, meeting the light projected upwards from a Gobo projector located at the lowest floor. At the rooftop, a custom designed laser light (also used by astronomers to point at stars), projects into the universe the artist's symbol of the HMap. The natural and the artificial lights meet again symbolically at the antipodes of the museum, close to New Zealand at 49° 28′ 56.68″ S, 171° 31′ 29.63″ E.

Seven rooms contain the seven holes, starting from above: Infinite Room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hn2b.net/HHole/7-infinite/infinite.php-page=text.htm|title=Infinite Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phoenix Room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hn2b.net/HHole/6-phoenix/phoenix.php-page=text.htm|title=Phoenix Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflection Room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hn2b.net/HHole/5-reflection/reflection.php-page=text.htm|title=Reflection Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silence Room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hn2b.net/HHole/4-silence/silence.php-page=text.htm|title=Silence Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treasure Room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hn2b.net/HHole/3-treasure/treasure.php-page=text.htm|title=Treasure Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ground Room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hn2b.net/HHole/2-ground/ground.php-page=text.htm|title=Ground Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Earth Room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hn2b.net/HHole/1-earth/earth.php-page=text.htm|title=Earth Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each room hosts different installations, with videos, HHole specially designed acrylic furniture, waterfall, living tree, pool, and telephone to connect each level.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3072">'''Hard spheres''' are widely used as model particles in the [[statistical mechanics|statistical mechanical]] theory of fluids and solids. They are defined simply as impenetrable spheres that cannot overlap in space. They mimic the extremely strong ("infinitely elastic bouncing") repulsion that atoms and spherical molecules experience at very close distances. Hard spheres systems are studied by analytical means, by [[molecular dynamics]] simulations, and by the experimental study of certain [[colloid]]al model systems.

==Formal definition==

Hard spheres of diameter &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; are particles with the following pairwise interaction potential:

:&lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{r}_1,\mathbf{r}_2)=\left\{ \begin{matrix}0 &amp; \mbox{if}\quad |\mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf{r}_2| \geq \sigma \\ \infty &amp; \mbox{if}\quad|\mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf{r}_2| &lt; \sigma \end{matrix} \right. &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_2&lt;/math&gt; are the positions of the two particles.

==Hard-spheres gas==

The first three [[virial coefficient]]s for hard spheres can be determined analytically

:{|
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{B_2}{v_0}&lt;/math&gt;||=||&lt;math&gt;4{\frac{}{}}&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{B_3}{{v_0}^2}&lt;/math&gt;||=|| &lt;math&gt;10{\frac{}{}}&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{B_4}{{v_0}^3}&lt;/math&gt;||=|| &lt;math&gt;-\frac{712}{35}+\frac{219 \sqrt{2}}{35 \pi}+\frac{4131}{35 \pi} \arccos{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}\approx 18.365&lt;/math&gt; 
|}

Higher-order ones can be determined numerically using [[Monte Carlo integration]]. We list

:{|
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{B_5}{{v_0}^4}&lt;/math&gt;||=|| &lt;math&gt;28.24 \pm 0.08&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{B_6}{{v_0}^5}&lt;/math&gt;||=|| &lt;math&gt;39.5 \pm 0.4&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{B_7}{{v_0}^6}&lt;/math&gt;||=|| &lt;math&gt;56.5 \pm 1.6&lt;/math&gt;
|}
A table of virial coefficients for up to eight dimensions can be found on the page [http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/Hard_sphere:_virial_coefficients Hard sphere: virial coefficients].

The hard sphere system exhibits a fluid-solid phase transition between the [[packing density|volume fractions]] of freezing &lt;math&gt;\eta_\mathrm{f}\approx 0.494&lt;/math&gt; and melting &lt;math&gt;\eta_\mathrm{m}\approx 0.545&lt;/math&gt;. The pressure diverges at random close packing &lt;math&gt;\eta_\mathrm{rcp}\approx 0.644&lt;/math&gt; for the metastable liquid branch and at close packing &lt;math&gt;\eta_\mathrm{cp}=\sqrt{2}\pi/6 \approx 0.74048&lt;/math&gt; for the stable solid branch.

==Hard-spheres liquid==

The [[static structure factor]] of the hard-spheres liquid can be calculated using the [[Percus–Yevick approximation]].

'''''Hauling''''' is a 2010 [[documentary film]] on poor families who work as recyclers in [[Sao Paulo]], [[Brazil]].

==Plot==
The recycling underworld of Sao Paulo, Brazil is the background to this documentary centering on Claudieni, father to 27 children. In his green VW bus, he visits the Santa Efigenia neighborhood of Sao Paulo to recycle plastic, cardboard, and computers and other electronic equipment. He and his family represent the lower class of people who are discriminated against by other strata of society.

The film will have its U.S. West Coast premiere at the [[San Francisco Green Film Festival]] in March 2011.{{Update after|2011|04|01}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5393">In [[computer science]], and in particular [[functional programming]], a '''hylomorphism''' is a [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]] function, corresponding to the [[function composition|composition]] of an [[anamorphism]] (which first builds a set of results; also known as 'unfolding') followed by a [[catamorphism]] (which then [[fold (higher-order function)|folds]] these results into a final [[return value]]). Fusion of these two recursive computations into a single recursive pattern then avoids building the intermediate data structure. This is an example of [[deforestation (computer science)|deforestation]], a program optimization strategy. A related type of function is a '''metamorphism''', which is a catamorphism followed by an anamorphism.

==Formal definition==

A hylomorphism &lt;math&gt;h : A \rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt; can be defined in terms of its separate anamorphic and catamorphic parts.

The anamorphic part can be defined in terms of a [[arity|unary]] function &lt;math&gt;g : A \rightarrow B \times A&lt;/math&gt; defining the list of elements in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; by repeated application (''"unfolding"''), and a [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] &lt;math&gt;p : A \rightarrow \text{Boolean}&lt;/math&gt; providing the terminating condition.

The catamorphic part can be defined as a combination of an initial value &lt;math&gt;c \in C&lt;/math&gt; for the fold and a binary [[Operation (mathematics)|operator]] &lt;math&gt;\oplus : B \times C \rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt; used to perform the fold.

Thus a hylomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;
h\,a = \begin{cases}
 c &amp; \mbox{if } p\,a
 \\b \oplus h\,a' \,\,\,where \,(b, a') = g\,a &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
 \end{cases}
 &lt;/math&gt;
may be defined (assuming appropriate definitions of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; &amp; &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;).

===Notation===
An abbreviated notation for the above hylomorphism is &lt;math&gt;h = [\![(c, \oplus),(g, p)]\!]&lt;/math&gt;.

==Hylomorphisms in practice==

===Lists===
[[List (computing)|Lists]] are common data structures as they naturally reflect linear computational processes.  These processes arise in repeated ([[Iteration|iterative]]) function calls.  Therefore, it is sometimes necessary to generate a temporary list of intermediate results before reducing this list to a single result.

One example of a commonly encountered hylomorphism is the canonical [[factorial]] function.

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
factorial :: Integer -&gt; Integer
factorial n
  | n == 0 = 1
  | n &gt; 0 = n * factorial (n - 1)
&lt;/source&gt;

In the previous example (written in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], a [[purely functional programming language]]) it can be seen that this function, applied to any given valid input, will generate a linear call tree [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a list. For example, given ''n'' = 5 it will produce the following:

 factorial 5 = 5 * (factorial 4) = 120
 factorial 4 = 4 * (factorial 3) = 24
 factorial 3 = 3 * (factorial 2) = 6
 factorial 2 = 2 * (factorial 1) = 2
 factorial 1 = 1 * (factorial 0) = 1
 factorial 0 = 1

In this example, the anamorphic part of the process is the generation of the call tree which is isomorphic to the list &lt;code&gt;[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]&lt;/code&gt;. The catamorphism, then, is the calculation of the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of the [[element (mathematics)|elements]] of this list. Thus, in the notation given above, the factorial function may be written &lt;math&gt;\text{factorial} = [\![(1,\times),(g, p)]\!]&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;g\ n = (n, n - 1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p\ n = (n = 0)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Trees===

However, the term 'hylomorphism' does not apply solely to functions acting upon isomorphisms of lists. For example, a hylomorphism may also be defined by generating a non-linear call tree which is then collapsed. An example of such a function is the function to generate the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[term (mathematics)|term]] of the [[Fibonacci sequence]].

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 fibonacci :: Integer -&gt; Integer
 fibonacci n
   | n == 0 = 0
   | n == 1 = 1
   | n &gt; 1 = fibonacci (n - 2) + fibonacci (n - 1)
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Image:Fib 4.png|thumb|300px|Call tree for &lt;code&gt;fibonacci 4&lt;/code&gt;.]]

This function, again applied to any valid input, will generate a call tree which is non-linear. In the example on the right, the call tree generated by applying the &lt;code&gt;fibonacci&lt;/code&gt; function to the input &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt;.

This time, the anamorphism is the generation of the call tree isomorphic to the tree with [[leaf node]]s &lt;code&gt;0, 1, 1, 0, 1&lt;/code&gt; and the catamorphism the [[summation]] of these leaf nodes.

'''Industrial ecology''' ('''IE''') is the study of [[material flow|material]] and [[energy flow (ecology)|energy flows]] through industrial systems.  The [[global economy|global]] [[industrial economy]] can be modelled as a network of industrial processes that extract resources from the [[Earth]] and transform those resources into [[Commodity|commodities]] which can be bought and sold to meet the needs of humanity.  Industrial ecology seeks to quantify the material flows and document the industrial processes that make modern society function.  Industrial ecologists are often concerned with the impacts that industrial activities have on the [[Natural environment|environment]], with use of the planet's supply of [[natural resources]], and with problems of [[waste disposal]].  Industrial ecology is a young but growing multidisciplinary field of research which combines aspects of [[engineering]], [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[toxicology]] and the [[Outline of natural science|natural sciences]].

Industrial ecology has been defined as a "systems-based, multidisciplinary discourse that seeks to understand emergent behaviour of complex integrated human/natural systems".&lt;ref name="OntologiesOfIE"/&gt;  The field approaches issues of [[sustainability]] by examining problems from multiple perspectives, usually involving aspects of sociology, the [[natural environment|environment]], [[economy]] and [[technology]].  The name comes from the idea that the analogy of natural systems should be used as an aid in understanding how to design sustainable industrial systems.&lt;ref name="StrategiesForManufacturing"/&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:IndustrialSymbiosisWasteHeatExchange.png|250px|right|thumb|Example of [[Industrial Symbiosis]].  Waste steam from a [[Waste incineration|waste incinerator]] (right) is piped to an [[Ethanol fuel|ethanol plant]] (left) where it is used as in input to their production process.]]
Industrial ecology is concerned with the shifting of industrial process from linear (open loop) systems, in which resource and capital investments move through the system to become waste, to a closed loop system where wastes can become inputs for new processes.

Much of the research focuses on the following areas:&lt;ref name="is4ieHistory"/&gt;
* [[Material flow analysis|material]] and energy flow studies ("[[industrial metabolism]]")
* [[dematerialization (economics)|dematerialization]] and [[Low-carbon economy|decarbonization]]
* technological change and the environment
* [[life cycle assessment|life-cycle planning, design and assessment]]
* [[Design for Environment|design for the environment ("eco-design")]]
* [[Extended producer responsibility| extended producer responsibility ("product stewardship")]]
* [[Eco-industrial park| eco-industrial parks ("industrial symbiosis") ]]
* product-oriented environmental policy
* [[eco-efficiency]]

Industrial ecology seeks to understand the way in which industrial systems (for example a factory, an [[ecoregion]], or national or global economy) interact with the [[biosphere]].  Natural ecosystems provide a metaphor for understanding how different parts of industrial systems interact with one another, in an "ecosystem" based on resources and [[infrastructural capital]] rather than on [[natural capital]]. It seeks to exploit the idea that natural systems do not have waste in them to inspire [[sustainable design]].

Along with more general [[energy conservation]] and material conservation goals, and redefining [[commodity markets]] and [[product stewardship]] relations strictly as a [[service economy]], industrial ecology is one of the four objectives of [[Natural Capitalism]].  This strategy discourages forms of amoral purchasing arising from ignorance of what goes on at a distance and implies a [[political economy]] that values [[natural capital]] highly and relies on more [[instructional capital]] to design and maintain each unique industrial ecology.

==History==
[[File:View from Asnaes power station Kalundborg Denmark.jpg|300px|right|thumb|View of [[Kalundborg Eco-industrial Park]]]]
{{Main|History of industrial ecology}}

Industrial ecology was popularized in 1989 in a ''[[Scientific American]]'' article by [[Robert Frosch]] and Nicholas E. Gallopoulos.  Frosch and Gallopoulos' vision was "why would not our industrial system behave like an [[ecosystem]], where the wastes of a species may be [[natural resource|resource]] to another species? Why would not the outputs of an industry be the inputs of another, thus reducing use of [[raw material]]s, [[pollution]], and saving on [[waste]] treatment?"&lt;ref name="StrategiesForManufacturing"/&gt;  A notable example resides in a Danish industrial park in the city of [[Kalundborg Eco-industrial Park|Kalundborg]].  Here several linkages of [[byproduct]]s and [[waste heat]] can be found between numerous entities such as a large power plant, an oil refinery, a pharmaceutical plant, a plasterboard factory, an enzyme manufacturer, a waste company and the city itself.&lt;ref name="KalundborgCentre"/&gt; Another example is the Rantasalmi EIP in Rantasalmi, Finland. While this country has had previous organically formed EIP's, the park at Rantasalmi is Finland's first planned EIP.

The scientific field Industrial Ecology has grown quickly in recent years. The Journal of Industrial Ecology (since 1997), the [[International Society for Industrial Ecology]] (since 2001), and the journal Progress in Industrial Ecology (since 2004) give Industrial Ecology a strong and dynamic position in the international scientific community.  Industrial Ecology principles are also emerging in various policy realms such as the concept of the [[Circular Economy]] that is being promoted in China. Although the definition of the Circular Economy has yet to be formalized, generally the focus is on strategies such as creating a circular flow of materials, and cascading energy flows. An example of this would be using waste heat from one process to run another process that requires a lower temperature. The hope is that strategy such as this will create a more efficient economy with fewer pollutants and other unwanted by-products.&lt;ref name="CircularEconomy"/&gt;

== Principles ==
One of the central principles of Industrial Ecology is the view that societal and technological systems are bounded within the [[biosphere]], and do not exist outside it.  [[Ecology]] is used as a ''metaphor'' due to the observation that natural systems reuse materials and have a largely closed loop cycling of nutrients.  Industrial Ecology approaches problems with the hypothesis that by using similar principles as ''natural systems, industrial systems'' can be improved to reduce their impact on the natural environment as well. The table shows the general metaphor.

IE examines societal issues and their relationship with both technical systems and the environment. Through this ''[[holistic]] view '', IE recognizes that solving problems must involve understanding the connections that exist between these systems, various aspects cannot be viewed in isolation. Often changes in one part of the overall [[system]] can propagate and cause changes in another part. Thus, you can only understand a problem if you look at its parts in relation to the whole. Based on this framework, IE looks at environmental issues with a ''[[systems thinking]]'' approach. A good IE example with these societal impacts can be found at the [[Blue Lagoon (geothermal spa)|Blue Lagoon]] in Iceland. The Lagoon uses super-heated water from a local geothermal power plant to fill mineral-rich basins that have become recreational healing centers. In this sense the industrial process of energy production uses its wastewater to provide a crucial resource for the dependent recreational industry.

Take a city for instance. A city can be divided into commercial areas, residential areas, offices, services, infrastructures, and so forth. These are all sub-systems of the 'big city’ system. Problems can emerge in one sub-system, but the solution has to be global. Let’s say the price of housing is rising dramatically because there is too high a demand for housing. One solution would be to build new houses, but this will lead to more people living in the city, leading to the need for more infrastructure like roads, schools, more supermarkets, etc. This system is a simplified interpretation of reality whose behaviors can be ‘predicted’.

In many cases, the systems IE deals with are complex systems. [[Complex systems|Complexity]] makes it difficult to understand the behavior of the system and may lead to rebound effects. Due to unforeseen behavioral change of users or consumers, a measure taken to improve environmental performance does not lead to any improvement or may even worsen the situation.

Moreover, ''life cycle thinking'' is also a very important principle in industrial ecology. It implies that all environmental impacts caused by a product, system, or project during its life cycle are taken into account. In this context life cycle includes
*[[Raw material]] extraction
*[[Material processing]]
*Manufacture
*Use
*Maintenance
*Disposal
The transport necessary between these stages is also taken into account as well as, if relevant, extra stages such as [[reuse]], [[Remanufacturing|remanufacture]], and [[recycle]].
Adopting a life cycle approach is essential to avoid shifting environmental impacts from one life cycle stage to another. This is commonly referred to as problem shifting. For instance, during the re-design of a product, one can choose to reduce its weight, thereby decreasing use of resources. However, it is possible that the lighter materials used in the new product will be more difficult to dispose of. The environmental impacts of the product gained during the extraction phase are shifted to the disposal phase. Overall environmental improvements are thus null.

A final important principle of IE is its ''integrated approach'' or ''[[Multidisciplinary approach|multidisciplinarity]]''. IE takes into account three different disciplines: social sciences (including economics), technical sciences and environmental sciences. The challenge is to merge them into a single approach.

==Examples==
The [[Kalundborg]] industrial park is located in Denmark. This industrial park is special because companies reuse each other's waste (which then becomes by-products). For example, the Energy E2 [[Asnæs Power Station]] produces [[gypsum]] as a by-product of the electricity generation process; this gypsum becomes a resource for the BPB Gyproc A/S which produces plasterboards.&lt;ref name="KalundborgCentre"/&gt; This is one example of a system inspired by the biosphere-technosphere metaphor: in ecosystems, the waste from one organism is used as inputs to other organisms; in industrial systems, waste from a company is used as a resource by others.

Apart from the direct benefit of incorporating waste into the loop, the use of an eco-industrial park can be a means of making renewable energy generating plants, like [[Photovoltaic system|Solar PV]], more economical and environmentally friendly. In essence, this assists the growth of the [[renewable energy industry]] and the environmental benefits that come with replacing fossil-fuels.&lt;ref name="PearcePhotovoltaic"/&gt;

Additional examples of industrial ecology include:
*Substituting the fly ash byproduct of coal burning practices for cement in concrete production&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Michael. "Optimizing the Use of Fly Ash in Concrete." Portland Cement Association&lt;/ref&gt;
*Using second generation biofuels. An example of this is converting grease or cooking oil to biodiesels to fuel vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.extension.org/pages/28000/used-and-waste-oil-and-grease-for-biodiesel|title=Used and Waste Oil and Grease for Biodiesel - eXtension|author=|date=|website=extension.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*South Africa's National Cleaner Production Center (NCPC) was created in order to make the region's industries more efficient in terms of materials. Results of the use of sustainable methods will include lowered energy costs and improved waste management. The program assesses existing companies to implement change.&lt;ref&gt;http://ncpc.co.za&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future directions==
The [[ecosystem]] metaphor popularized by [[Robert Frosch|Frosch]] and Gallopoulos&lt;ref name="StrategiesForManufacturing" /&gt; has been a valuable creative tool for helping researchers look for novel solutions to difficult problems.  Recently, it has been pointed out that this metaphor is based largely on a model of classical ecology, and that advancements in understanding ecology based on [[complexity science]] have been made by researchers such as [[C. S. Holling]], [[James J. Kay]],&lt;ref name="OnComplexityTheory"/&gt; and further advanced in terms of contemporary ecology by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levine | first1 = S.

.&lt;ref name="ABMAndIE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ApplyingABMinIE"/&gt;

[[Exergy]] analysis is performed in the field of industrial ecology to use energy more efficiently.&lt;ref name="ExergyUsefulConcept"/&gt; The term ''exergy'' was coined by [[Zoran Rant]] in 1956, but the concept was developed by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|J. Willard Gibbs]]. In recent decades, utilization of exergy has spread outside physics and engineering to the fields of industrial ecology, [[ecological economics]], [[systems ecology]], and [[energetics]].

== Other examples ==

Another great example of industrial ecology both in practice and in potential is the Burnside Cleaner Production Centre in [[Burnside, Nova Scotia]]. They play a role in facilitating the 'greening' of over 1200 businesses that are located in Burnside, Eastern Canada's largest industrial park. The creation of waste exchange is a big part of what they work towards, which will promote strong industrial ecology relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newcity.ca/Pages/industrial_ecology.html|title=Industrial Ecology: From Theory to Practice|author=|date=|website=newcity.ca|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Números hiperreales.png|450px|thumb|Infinitesimals (ε) and infinites (ω) on the hyperreal number line (ε = 1/ω)]]

In [[mathematics]], '''infinitesimals''' are things so small that there is no way to measure them. The insight with exploiting infinitesimals was that entities could still retain certain specific properties, such as [[angle]] or [[slope]], even though these entities were quantitatively small.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/continuity/#1&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''infinitesimal'' comes from a 17th-century [[New Latin|Modern Latin]] coinage ''infinitesimus'', which originally referred to the "[[Infinity|infinite]][[Ordinal number (linguistics)|-th]]" item in a sequence.  
Infinitesimals are a basic ingredient in the procedures of infinitesimal [[calculus]] as developed by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], including the [[law of continuity]] and the [[transcendental law of homogeneity]]. In common speech, an infinitesimal object is an object that is smaller than any feasible measurement, but not zero in size—or, so small that it cannot be distinguished from zero by any available means. Hence, when used as an adjective, "infinitesimal" means "extremely small".  To give it a meaning, it usually must be compared to another infinitesimal object in the same context (as in a [[derivative]]).  Infinitely many infinitesimals are summed to produce an [[integral]].

The concept of infinitesimals was originally introduced around 1670 by either [[Nicolaus Mercator]] or [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation

I. SCIAMVS 2 (2001), 9–29.&lt;/ref&gt; In his formal published treatises, Archimedes solved the same problem using the [[method of exhaustion]].  The 15th century saw the work of [[Nicholas of Cusa]], further developed in the 17th century by [[Johannes Kepler]], in particular calculation of area of a circle by representing the latter as an infinite-sided polygon. [[Simon Stevin]]'s work on decimal representation of all numbers in the 16th century prepared the ground for the real continuum. [[Bonaventura Cavalieri]]'s method of indivisibles led to an extension of the results of the classical authors.  The method of indivisibles related to geometrical figures as being composed of entities of [[codimension]] 1. [[John Wallis]]'s infinitesimals differed from indivisibles in that he would decompose geometrical figures into infinitely thin building blocks of the same dimension as the figure, preparing the ground for general methods of the integral calculus.  He exploited an infinitesimal denoted [[1/∞]] in area calculations.

The use of infinitesimals by Leibniz relied upon heuristic principles, such as the law of continuity: what succeeds for the finite numbers succeeds also for the infinite numbers and vice versa; and the transcendental law of homogeneity that specifies procedures for replacing expressions involving inassignable quantities, by expressions involving only assignable ones. The 18th century saw routine use of infinitesimals by mathematicians such as [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]]. [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]] exploited infinitesimals both in defining [[continuous function|continuity]] in his ''[[Cours d'Analyse]]'', and in defining an early form of a [[Dirac delta function]].  As Cantor and Dedekind were developing more abstract versions of Stevin's continuum, [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]] wrote a series of papers on infinitesimal-enriched continua based on growth rates of functions.  Du Bois-Reymond's work inspired both [[Émile Borel]] and [[Thoralf Skolem]].  Borel explicitly linked du Bois-Reymond's work to Cauchy's work on rates of growth of infinitesimals.  Skolem developed the first non-standard models of arithmetic in 1934.  A mathematical implementation of both the law of continuity and infinitesimals was achieved by [[Abraham Robinson]] in 1961, who developed [[non-standard analysis]] based on earlier work by [[Edwin Hewitt]] in 1948 and [[Jerzy Łoś]] in 1955.  The [[hyperreal number|hyperreals]] implement an infinitesimal-enriched continuum and the [[transfer principle]] implements Leibniz's law of continuity. The [[standard part function]] implements Fermat's [[adequality]].

[[Vladimir Arnold]] wrote in 1990:
:Nowadays, when teaching analysis, it is not very popular to talk about infinitesimal quantities. Consequently present-day students are not fully in command of this language. Nevertheless, it is still necessary to have command of it.&lt;ref&gt;Arnolʹd, V. I. ''Huygens and Barrow, Newton and Hooke. Pioneers in mathematical analysis and catastrophe theory from evolvents to quasicrystals''. Translated from the Russian by Eric J. F. Primrose. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, 1990. p.&amp;nbsp;27&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the infinitesimal==
The notion of infinitely small quantities was discussed by the [[Eleatic School]]. The [[Greek mathematics|Greek]] mathematician [[Archimedes]] (c.287 BC–c.212 BC), in ''[[The Method of Mechanical Theorems]]'', was the first to propose a logically rigorous definition of infinitesimals.&lt;ref&gt;Archimedes, ''The Method of Mechanical Theorems''; see [[Archimedes Palimpsest]]&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Archimedean property]] defines a number ''x'' as infinite if it satisfies the conditions |''x''|&gt;1, |''x''|&gt;1+1, |''x''|&gt;1+1+1, ..., and infinitesimal if ''x''≠0 and a similar set of conditions holds for ''x'' and the reciprocals of the positive integers. A number system is said to be Archimedean if it contains no infinite or infinitesimal members.

The English mathematician [[John Wallis]] introduced the expression 1/∞ in his 1655 book ''Treatise on the Conic Sections''. The symbol, which denotes the reciprocal, or inverse, of&amp;nbsp;[[∞]], is the symbolic representation of the mathematical concept of an infinitesimal. In his ''Treatise on the Conic Sections'' Wallis also discusses the concept of a relationship between the symbolic representation of infinitesimal 1/∞ that he introduced and the concept of infinity for which he introduced the symbol&amp;nbsp;∞. The concept suggests a [[thought experiment]] of adding an infinite number of [[parallelogram]]s of infinitesimal width to form a finite area.  This concept was the predecessor to the modern method of integration used in [[integral calculus]]. The conceptual origins of the concept of the infinitesimal 1/∞ can be traced as far back as the Greek philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]], whose [[Zeno's dichotomy paradox]] was the first mathematical concept to consider the relationship between a finite interval and an interval approaching that of an infinitesimal-sized interval.

Infinitesimals were the subject of political and religious controversies in 17th century Europe, including a ban on infinitesimals issued by clerics in Rome in 1632.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Infinitesimal: How a Dangerous Mathematical Theory Shaped the Modern World|author=[[Amir Alexander]]|isbn=978-0374176815|year=2014|publisher=Scientific American / Farrar, Straus and Giroux}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the invention of calculus mathematicians were able to calculate tangent lines using [[Pierre de Fermat]]'s method of [[adequality]] and [[René Descartes]]' [[method of normals]].  There is debate among scholars as to whether the method was infinitesimal or algebraic in nature.  When [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] invented the [[Infinitesimal calculus|calculus]], they made use of infinitesimals, Newton's ''[[fluxion (mathematics)|fluxions]]'' and Leibniz' ''[[differential (infinitesimal)|differential]]''. The use of infinitesimals was attacked as incorrect by [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]] in his work ''[[The Analyst]]''.&lt;ref&gt;George Berkeley, ''The Analyst; or a discourse addressed to an infidel mathematician''&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematicians, scientists, and engineers continued to use infinitesimals to produce correct results. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the calculus was reformulated by [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Karl Weierstrass]], [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]], [[Dedekind]], and others using the [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit]] and [[set theory]].  
While the followers of Cantor, Dedekind, and Weierstrass sought to rid analysis of infinitesimals, and their philosophical allies like [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]] declared that infinitesimals are ''pseudoconcepts'', [[Hermann Cohen]] and his [[Marburg school]] of [[neo-Kantianism]] sought to develop a working logic of infinitesimals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Mormann]]; [[Mikhail Katz]]. Infinitesimals as an issue of neo-Kantian philosophy of science. [[International Society for the History of Philosophy of Science|HOPOS]]: The Journal of the International Society for the History of Philosophy of Science 3 (2013), no. 2, 236–280. {{doi|10.1086/671348}}. {{JSTOR|10.1086/671348}}. {{arXiv|1304.1027}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mathematical study of systems containing infinitesimals continued through the work of [[Tullio Levi-Civita|Levi-Civita]], [[Giuseppe Veronese]], [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]], and others, throughout the late nineteenth and the twentieth centuries, as documented by [[Philip Ehrlich]] (2006).  In the 20th century, it was found that infinitesimals could serve as a basis for calculus and analysis; see [[hyperreal number]].

==First-order properties==
In extending the real numbers to include infinite and infinitesimal quantities, one typically wishes to be as conservative as possible by not changing any of their elementary properties. This guarantees that as many familiar results as possible are still available. Typically ''elementary'' means that there is no [[quantification (logic)|quantification]] over [[set (mathematics)|sets]], but only over elements. This limitation allows statements of the form "for any number x..." For example, the axiom that states "for any number&amp;nbsp;''x'', ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''" would still apply. The same is true for quantification over several numbers, e.g., "for any numbers&amp;nbsp;''x'' and ''y'', ''xy''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''yx''."  However, statements of the form "for any ''set''&amp;nbsp;''S''&amp;nbsp;of numbers&amp;nbsp;..." may not carry over. Logic with this limitation on quantification is referred to as [[first-order logic]].

The resulting extended number system cannot agree with the reals on all properties that can be expressed by quantification over sets, because the goal is to construct a non-Archimedean system, and the Archimedean principle can be expressed by quantification over sets. One can conservatively extend any theory including reals, including set theory, to include infinitesimals, just by adding a countably infinite list of axioms that assert that a number is smaller than 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 and so on. Similarly, the [[Complete metric space|completeness]] property cannot be expected to carry over, because the reals are the unique complete ordered field up to isomorphism.

We can distinguish three levels at which a nonarchimedean number system could have first-order properties compatible with those of the reals:

# An [[ordered field]] obeys all the usual axioms of the real number system that can be stated in first-order logic. For example, the [[commutativity]] axiom ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'' holds.
# A [[real closed field]] has all the first-order properties of the real number system, regardless of whether they are usually taken as axiomatic, for statements involving the basic ordered-field relations +,&amp;nbsp;×, and&amp;nbsp;≤. This is a stronger condition than obeying the ordered-field axioms.  More specifically, one includes additional first-order properties, such as the existence of a root for every odd-degree polynomial. For example, every number must have a [[cube root]].
# The system could have all the first-order properties of the real number system for statements involving ''any'' relations (regardless of whether those relations can be expressed using&amp;nbsp;+,&amp;nbsp;×, and&amp;nbsp;≤). For example, there would have to be a [[sine]] function that is well defined for infinite inputs; the same is true for every real function.

Systems in category 1, at the weak end of the spectrum, are relatively easy to construct, but do not allow a full treatment of classical analysis using infinitesimals in the spirit of Newton and Leibniz. For example, the [[transcendental functions]] are defined in terms of infinite limiting processes, and therefore there is typically no way to define them in first-order logic. Increasing the analytic strength of the system by passing to categories&amp;nbsp;2 and&amp;nbsp;3, we find that the flavor of the treatment tends to become less constructive, and it becomes more difficult to say anything concrete about the hierarchical structure of infinities and infinitesimals.

==Number systems that include infinitesimals==

===Formal series===

====Laurent series====
An example from category 1 above is the field of [[Laurent series]] with a finite number of negative-power terms. For example, the Laurent series consisting only of the constant term 1 is identified with the real number&amp;nbsp;1, and the series with only the linear term&amp;nbsp;''x'' is thought of as the simplest infinitesimal, from which the other infinitesimals are constructed. Dictionary ordering is used, which is equivalent to considering higher powers of&amp;nbsp;''x'' as negligible compared to lower powers. [[David O. Tall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jonhoyle.com/MAAseaway/Infinitesimals.html |title=Infinitesimals in Modern Mathematics |publisher=Jonhoyle.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713115815/http://www.jonhoyle.com/MAAseaway/Infinitesimals.html |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to this system as the super-reals, not to be confused with the [[superreal number]] system of Dales and Woodin. Since a Taylor series evaluated with a Laurent series as its argument is still a Laurent series, the system can be used to do calculus on transcendental functions if they are analytic. These infinitesimals have different first-order properties than the reals because, for example, the basic infinitesimal&amp;nbsp;''x'' does not have a square root.

====The Levi-Civita field====
The [[Levi-Civita field]] is similar to the Laurent series, but is algebraically closed. For example, the basic infinitesimal x has a square root. This field is rich enough to allow a significant amount of analysis to be done, but its elements can still be represented on a computer in the same sense that real numbers can be represented in floating point.&lt;ref&gt;Khodr Shamseddine, "Analysis on the Levi-Civia Field: A Brief Overview," http://www.uwec.edu/surepam/media/RS-Overview.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transseries====
The field of [[transseries]] is larger than the Levi-Civita field.&lt;ref&gt;G. A. Edgar, "Transseries for Beginners," http://www.math.ohio-state.edu/~edgar/preprints/trans_begin/&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a transseries is:

:&lt;math&gt;e^\sqrt{\ln\ln x}+\ln\ln x+\sum_{j=0}^\infty e^x x^{-j},&lt;/math&gt;

where for purposes of ordering ''x'' is considered infinite.

===Surreal numbers===
Conway's [[surreal numbers]] fall into category 2. They are a system designed to be as rich as possible in different sizes of numbers, but not necessarily for convenience in doing analysis. Certain transcendental functions can be carried over to the surreals, including logarithms and exponentials, but most, e.g., the sine function, cannot{{fact|date=May 2017}}&lt;!--this seems dubious, see [https://mathoverflow.net/questions/91337/uniformizing-the-surcomplex-unit-circle] In any case, to make the assertion clear, one should be make precise what it is to be expected from such extensions --&gt;. The existence of any particular surreal number, even one that has a direct counterpart in the reals, is not known a priori, and must be proved.{{clarify|date=May 2017}}

===Hyperreals===
{{Main article|Hyperreal number}}
The most widespread technique for handling infinitesimals is the hyperreals, developed by [[Abraham Robinson]] in the 1960s. They fall into category 3 above, having been designed that way so all of classical analysis can be carried over from the reals. This property of being able to carry over all relations in a natural way is known as the [[transfer principle]], proved by [[Jerzy Łoś]] in 1955.  For example, the transcendental function sin has a natural counterpart *sin that takes a hyperreal input and gives a hyperreal output, and similarly the set of natural numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; has a natural counterpart &lt;math&gt;^*\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, which contains both finite and infinite integers. A proposition such as &lt;math&gt;\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \sin n\pi=0&lt;/math&gt; carries over to the hyperreals as &lt;math&gt;\forall n \in {}^*\mathbb{N}, {}^*\!\!\sin n\pi=0&lt;/math&gt; .

===Superreals===
The [[superreal number]] system of Dales and Woodin is a generalization of the hyperreals. It is different from the super-real system defined by [[David O. Tall|David Tall]].

===Dual numbers===
{{Main article|Dual number}}
In [[linear algebra]], the [[dual number]]s extend the reals by adjoining one infinitesimal, the new element ε with the property ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 (that is, ε is [[nilpotent]]). Every dual number has the form ''z'' = ''a'' + ''b''ε with ''a'' and ''b'' being uniquely determined real numbers.

One application of dual numbers is [[automatic differentiation]]. This application can be generalized to polynomials in n variables, using the [[Exterior algebra]] of an n-dimensional vector space.

===Smooth infinitesimal analysis ===
{{Main article|Smooth infinitesimal analysis}}
[[Synthetic differential geometry]] or [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]] have roots in [[category theory]]. This approach departs from the classical logic used in conventional mathematics by denying the general applicability of the [[law of excluded middle]] – i.e., ''not'' (''a'' ≠ ''b'') does not have to mean ''a'' = ''b''. A ''nilsquare'' or ''[[nilpotent]]'' infinitesimal can then be defined. This is a number ''x'' where ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 is true, but ''x'' = 0 need not be true at the same time.  Since the background logic is [[intuitionistic logic]], it is not immediately clear how to classify this system with regard to classes 1, 2, and 3.  Intuitionistic analogues of these classes would have to be developed first.

==Infinitesimal delta functions==
[[Cauchy]] used an infinitesimal &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; to write down a unit impulse, infinitely tall and narrow Dirac-type delta function &lt;math&gt;\delta_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\int F(x)\delta_\alpha(x) = F(0)&lt;/math&gt; in a number of articles in 1827, see Laugwitz (1989).  Cauchy defined an infinitesimal in 1821 (Cours d'Analyse) in terms of a sequence tending to zero.  Namely, such a null sequence becomes an infinitesimal in Cauchy's and [[Lazare Carnot]]'s terminology.

Modern set-theoretic approaches allow one to define infinitesimals via the [[ultrapower]] construction, where a null sequence becomes an infinitesimal in the sense of an equivalence class modulo a relation defined in terms of a suitable [[ultrafilter]]. The article by Yamashita (2007) contains a bibliography on modern [[Dirac delta function]]s in the context of an infinitesimal-enriched continuum provided by the [[hyperreal number|hyperreals]].

==Logical properties==
The method of constructing infinitesimals of the kind used in nonstandard analysis depends on the [[Model theory|model]] and which collection of [[axiom]]s are used. We consider here systems where infinitesimals can be shown to exist.

In 1936 [[Anatoly Maltsev|Maltsev]] proved the [[compactness theorem]]. This theorem is fundamental for the existence of infinitesimals as it proves that it is possible to formalise them. A consequence of this theorem is that if there is a number system in which it is true that for any positive integer ''n'' there is a positive number ''x'' such that 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1/''n'', then there exists an extension of that number system in which it is true that there exists a positive number ''x'' such that for any positive integer ''n'' we have 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1/''n''. The possibility to switch  "for any" and "there exists" is crucial. The first statement is true in the real numbers as given in [[ZFC]] [[set theory]] : for any positive integer ''n'' it is possible to find a real number between 1/''n'' and zero, but this real number depends on ''n''. Here, one chooses ''n'' first, then one finds the corresponding ''x''. In the second expression, the statement says that there is an  ''x'' (at least one), chosen first, which is between 0 and 1/''n'' for any ''n''. In this case ''x'' is infinitesimal. This is not true in the real numbers ('''R''') given by ZFC. Nonetheless, the theorem proves that there is a model (a number system) in which this is true. The question is: what is this model? What are its properties? Is there only one such model?

There are in fact many ways to construct such a [[dimension|one-dimensional]] [[linear order|linearly ordered]] set of numbers, but fundamentally, there are two different approaches:

: 1) Extend the number system so that it contains more numbers than the real numbers.

: 2) Extend the axioms (or extend the language) so that the distinction between the infinitesimals and non-infinitesimals can be made in the real numbers themselves.

In 1960, [[Abraham Robinson]] provided an answer following the first approach. The extended set is called the [[Hyperreal number|hyperreals]] and contains numbers less in absolute value than any positive real number. The method may be considered relatively complex but it does prove that infinitesimals exist in the universe of ZFC set theory. The real numbers are called standard numbers and the new non-real hyperreals are called [[Non-standard analysis|nonstandard]].

In 1977 [[Edward Nelson]] provided an answer following the second approach. The extended axioms are IST, which stands either for [[Internal set theory]] or for the initials of the three extra axioms: Idealization, Standardization, Transfer. In this system we consider that the language is extended in such a way that we can express facts about infinitesimals. The real numbers are either standard or nonstandard. An infinitesimal is a nonstandard real number that is less, in absolute value, than any positive standard real number.

In 2006 Karel Hrbacek developed an extension of Nelson's approach in which the real numbers are stratified in (infinitely) many levels; i.e., in the coarsest level there are no infinitesimals nor unlimited numbers. Infinitesimals are in a finer level and there are also infinitesimals with respect to this new level and so on.

==Infinitesimals in teaching==
Calculus textbooks based on infinitesimals include the classic ''[[Calculus Made Easy]]'' by [[Silvanus P. Thompson]] (bearing the motto "What one fool can do another can"&lt;ref&gt;Available online at 
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33283&lt;/ref&gt;) and the German text ''Mathematik fur Mittlere Technische Fachschulen der Maschinenindustrie'' by R Neuendorff.&lt;ref&gt;R Neuendorff (1912) ''Lehrbuch der Mathematik fur Mittlere Technische Fachschulen der Maschinenindustrie'', Verlag Julius Springer, Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt; Pioneering works based on [[Abraham Robinson]]'s infinitesimals include texts by [[Stroyan]] (dating from 1972) and [[Howard Jerome Keisler]] ([[Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach]]). Students easily relate to the intuitive notion of an infinitesimal difference 1-"[[0.999...]]", where  "0.999..." differs from its standard meaning as the real number 1, and is reinterpreted as an infinite terminating extended decimal that is strictly less than 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ely |first=Robert |year=2010 |title=Nonstandard student conceptions about infinitesimals |journal=[[Journal for Research in Mathematics Education]] |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=117–146 |jstor=20720128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.umt.edu/tmme/vol7no1/TMME_vol7no1_2010_article1_pp.3_30.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121207075126/http://www.math.umt.edu/tmme/vol7no1/TMME_vol7no1_2010_article1_pp.3_30.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another elementary calculus text that uses the theory of infinitesimals as developed by Robinson is ''Infinitesimal Calculus'' by Henle and Kleinberg, originally published in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Infinitesimal Calculus|last=Henle|first=James|last2=Kleinberg|first2=Eugene|publisher=The MIT Press, rereleased by Dover}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors introduce the language of first order logic, and demonstrate the construction of a first order model of the hyperreal numbers.  The text provides an introduction to the basics of integral and differential calculus in one dimension, including sequences and series of functions.  In an Appendix, they also treat the extension of their model to the ''hyperhyper''reals, and demonstrate some applications for the extended model.

==Functions tending to zero==
In a related but somewhat different sense, which evolved from the original definition of "infinitesimal" as an infinitely small quantity, the term has also been used to refer to a function tending to zero.  More precisely, Loomis and Sternberg's ''Advanced Calculus'' defines the function class of infinitesimals, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{I}&lt;/math&gt;, as a subset of functions &lt;math&gt;f:V\to W&lt;/math&gt; between normed vector spaces by &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{I}(V,W) = \{f:V\to W\ |\ f(0)=0, 
(\forall \epsilon&gt;0) (\exists \delta&gt;0)
\ \backepsilon\ ||\xi||&lt;\delta\implies
||f(\xi)||&lt;\epsilon\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;/blockquote&gt;as well as two related classes &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{O},\mathfrak{o}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Big O notation|Big-O notation]]) by &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{O}(V,W) = \{f:V\to W\ |\ f(0)=0,\ (\exist r&gt;0,c&gt;0)\ \backepsilon\  
||\xi||&lt; r \implies ||f(\xi)||\leq c||
\xi||\}&lt;/math&gt;, and&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{o}(V,W) = \{f:V\to W\ |\ f(0)=0,\ \lim_{||\xi||\to 0} ||f(\xi)|| / ||\xi|| = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/LoomisL.H.SternbergS.AdvancedCalculusRevisedEditionJonesAndBartlett|title=Advanced Calculus|last=Loomis|first=Lynn Harold|last2=Sternberg|first2=Shlomo|publisher=World Scientific|year=2014|isbn=978-981-4583-92-3|location=Hackensack, N.J.|pages=138–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The set inclusions &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{o}(V,W)\subsetneq\mathfrak{O}(V,W)\subsetneq\mathfrak{I}(V,W)&lt;/math&gt;generally hold.  That the inclusions are proper is demonstrated by the real-valued functions of a real variable &lt;math&gt;f:x\mapsto |x|^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g:x\mapsto x &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;h:x\mapsto x^2 &lt;/math&gt;:  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;f,g,h\in\mathfrak{I}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R}),\  g,h\in\mathfrak{O}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R}),\ 
h\in\mathfrak{o}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;f,g\notin\mathfrak{o}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f\notin\mathfrak{O}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;As an application of these definitions, a mapping &lt;math&gt;F:V\to W&lt;/math&gt; between normed vector spaces is defined to be differentiable at &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in V&lt;/math&gt; if there is a &lt;math&gt;T\in\mathrm{Hom}(V,W)&lt;/math&gt; [i.e, a bounded linear map &lt;math&gt;V\to W&lt;/math&gt;] such that &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;[F(\alpha+\xi)-F(\alpha)]-T(\xi)\in \mathfrak{o}(V,W)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;in a neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  If such a map exists, it is unique; this map is called the ''differential'' and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;dF_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;This notation is not to be confused with the many other distinct usages of ''d'' in calculus that are all loosely related to the classical notion of the differential as "taking an infinitesimally small piece of something": ''(1)'' in the expression&lt;math&gt;\int f(x)\, d\alpha(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d\alpha(x)&lt;/math&gt; indicates Riemann-Stieltjes integration with respect to the integrator function &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;; ''(2)'' in the expression &lt;math&gt;\int f\, d\mu&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d\mu&lt;/math&gt; symbolizes Lebesgue integration with respect to a measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;; ''(3)'' in the expression &lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbf{R}^n} f\; dV&lt;/math&gt;, ''dV'' indicates integration with respect to volume; ''(4)'' in the expression &lt;math&gt;dx^{i_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^{i_n}&lt;/math&gt;, the letter ''d'' represents the exterior derivative operator, and so on....&lt;/ref&gt; coinciding with the traditional notation for the classical (though logically flawed) notion of a differential as an infinitely small "piece" of ''F''.  This definition represents a generalization of the usual definition of differentiability for vector-valued functions of (open subsets of) Euclidean spaces.

==Array of random variables==
Let &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})&lt;/math&gt; be a [[probability space]] and let &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. An array &lt;math&gt;\{X_{n,k}:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}\mid 1\le k\le k_{n}\}&lt;/math&gt; of [[random variable]]s is called infinitesimal if for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, we have:&lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite journal |last=Barczyk|first=Adam |last2=Janssen|first2=Arnold |last3=Pauly|first3=Markus |year=2011 |title=The Asymptotics of L-statistics for non-i.i.d. variables with heavy tails|journal=[[Probability and mathematical statistics]] |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=285–299}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\max_{1\le k\le k_{n}}\mathbb{P}\{\omega\in\Omega\mid \vert X_{n,k}(\omega)\vert\geq\epsilon\}\to 0\text{ as } n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt; 
The notion of infinitesimal array is essential in some central limit theorems and it is easily seen by monotonicity of the expectation operator that any array satisfying [[Lindeberg's condition]] is infinitesimal, thus playing an important role in [[Central limit theorem#Lindeberg CLT|Lindeberg's Central Limit Theorem]] (a generalization of the [[central limit theorem]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3506">An '''integrative level''', or '''level of organization''', is a set of phenomena [[emergence|emerging]] from pre-existing phenomena of a lower level. The levels concept is an intellectual framework for structuring reality. It arranges all material entities and all processes in the universe into a hierarchy based on how complex the entity's organization is. When arranged this way, each entity is three things at the same time: It is made up of parts from the previous level below. It is a whole in its own right. And it is a part of the whole that is on the next level above. Typical examples include [[life]] emerging from non-living substances, and [[consciousness]] emerging from [[nervous system]]s. 

==Levels==
The main levels usually acknowledged are those of [[matter]], [[life]], [[mind]], and [[society]]. These are called ''strata'' in [[Nicolai Hartmann]]'s ontology. They can be further analyzed into more specific ''layers'', such as those of particles, atoms, molecules, and rocks forming the material stratum, or those of cells, organisms, populations, and ecosystems forming the life stratum.

The sequence of levels is often described as one of increasing [[complexity]], although it is not clear whether this is always true: for example, [[parasitism]] emerges on pre-existing organisms, although parasites are often simpler than their originating forms.

==Philosophies==

Ideas connected to integrative levels can be found in the works of both [[materialism|materialist]] philosophers,  and [[Idealism|anti-materialist]] ones.

'''Introspection''' is the examination of one's own [[conscious]] [[thought]]s and [[feeling]]s.&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;{{cite book | first=D. P. | last=Schultz |author2=Schultz, S. E. | title= A history of modern psychology (10th ed.) | year=2012| publisher= Wadsworth, Cengage Learning | isbn=978-1-133-31624-4 | url= | location= Belmont, CA | pages= 67–77, 88–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[psychology]], the process of introspection relies exclusively on observation of one's [[Mental representation|mental state]], while in a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] context it may refer to the examination of one's [[soul]]. Introspection is closely related to [[human self-reflection]] and is contrasted with [[observation|external observation]].

Introspection generally provides a privileged access to one's own mental states,&lt;ref&gt;W. Seager,[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123738738000712, Encyclopedia of ''Consciousness' ']&lt;/ref&gt; not mediated by other sources of knowledge, so that individual experience of the mind is unique. Introspection can determine any number of mental states including: sensory, bodily, cognitive, emotional and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;W. Seager,[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123738738000712, Encyclopedia of ''Consciousness'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Introspection has been a subject of philosophical discussion for thousands of years. The philosopher [[Plato]] asked, "…why should we not calmly and patiently review our own thoughts, and thoroughly examine and see what these appearances in us really are?"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', 155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J Perner et al (2007). "''Introspection &amp; remembering''". Synthese. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; While introspection is applicable to many facets of philosophical thought it is perhaps best known for its role in [[epistemology]], in this context introspection is often compared with [[perception]], [[reason]], [[memory]], and [[testimony]] as a source of [[knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;Epistemology. (2005). In ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Retrieved from http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/#SOU&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychology==

===Wundt===
It has often been claimed that [[Wilhelm Wundt]], the father of modern psychology, was the first to adopt introspection to [[experimental psychology]]&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; though the methodological idea had been presented long before, as by 18th century German philosopher-psychologists such as [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]] or [[Johann Nicolaus Tetens]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Thomas Sturm, ''Kant und die Wissenschaften vom Menschen'' (Paderborn: Mentis, 2009), ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Wundt's views on introspection must be approached with great care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Danziger | first1 = Kurt | year = 1980 | title = The History of Introspection Reconsidered | url = | journal = Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 241–262 | doi=10.1002/1520-6696(198007)16:3&lt;241::aid-jhbs2300160306&gt;3.0.co;2-o}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wundt was influenced by notable [[physiology|physiologists]], such as [[Gustav Fechner]], who used a kind of controlled introspection as a means to study human [[sense|sensory]] organs. Building upon the pre-existing use of introspection in physiology, Wundt believed the method of introspection was the ability to observe an experience, not just the logical reflection or speculations which some others interpreted his meaning to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asthana|first=Hari Shanker|date=June 2015|title=Wilhelm Wundt|url=|journal=Psychological Studies|volume=60|pages=244–248|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wundt imposed exacting control over the use of introspection in his experimental laboratory at the [[University of Leipzig]],&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; making it possible for other scientists to [[reproducibility|replicate]] his experiments elsewhere, a development that proved essential to the development of psychology as a modern, [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] scientific discipline. Such exact purism was typical of Wundt and he instructed all introspection observations be performed under these same instructions "1) the Observer must, if possible, be in a position to determine beforehand the entrance of the process to be observed. 2) the introspectionist must, as far as possible, grasp the phenomenon in a state of strained attention and follow its course. 3) Every observation must, in order to make certain, be capable of being repeated several times under the same conditions and 4) the conditions under which the phenomenon appears must be found out by the variation of the attendant circumstances and when this was done the various coherent experiments must be varied according to a plan partly by eliminating certain stimuli and partly by grading their strength and quality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asthana|first=Hari Shanker|date=June 2015|title=Wilhelm Wundt|url=|journal=Psychological Studies|volume=60|pages=244–248|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Titchener===
[[Edward B. Titchener|Edward Titchener]] was an early pioneer in experimental psychology and student of Wilhelm Wundt.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; After earning his doctorate under the tutelage of Wundt at the University of Leipzig, he made his way to [[Cornell University]] where he established his own laboratory and research.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; When Titchener arrived at Cornell in 1894, psychology was still a fledgling discipline, especially in the United States, and Titchener was a key figure in bringing Wundt's ideas to America. However, Titchener misrepresented some of Wundt's ideas to the American psychological establishment, especially in his account of introspection which, Titchener taught, only served a purpose in the [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] analysis of [[consciousness]] into its various parts,&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; while Wundt saw it as a means to [[Quantitative research|quantitatively]] measure the whole of conscious experience.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; Titchener was exclusively interested in the individual components that comprise conscious experience, while Wundt, seeing little purpose in the analysis of individual components, focused on synthesis of these components. Ultimately Titchener's ideas would form the basis of the short-lived psychological theory of [[Structuralism (psychology)|structuralism]].&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;

===Historical misconceptions===
American [[historiography]] of introspection, according to some authors,&lt;ref name="Costal 2006 634–654"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Costal|first=A|title='Introspectionism' and the mythical origins of scientific psychology|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|year=2006|volume=15|issue=4|pages=634–654|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2006.09.008|pmid=17174788}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clegg 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clegg|first=Joshua|title=Self-observation in the social science|year=2013|publisher=Transaction|location=New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt; is dominated by three misconceptions. In particular, historians of psychology tend to argue 1) that introspection once was the dominant method of psychological inquiry, 2) that behaviorism, and in particular [[John B. Watson]], is responsible for discrediting introspection as a valid method, and 3) that scientific [[psychology]] completely abandoned introspection as a result of those critiques.&lt;ref name="Costal 2006 634–654"/&gt; Yet, introspection has not been the dominant method. It is believed to be so because [[Edward B. Titchener|Edward Titchener]]'s student [[Edwin G. Boring]], in his influential historical accounts of experimental psychology privileged Titchener's views while giving little credit to original sources.&lt;ref name="Costal 2006 634–654"/&gt; Introspection has been critiqued by many other psychologists, including [[Wilhelm Wundt]], and [[Knight Dunlap]] who in his article "[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Dunlap/introspection.htm ''The Case Against Introspection'']", presents an argument against self-observation that is not primarily rooted in behaviorist epistemology. Introspection is still widely used in psychology, but under different names, such as self-report surveys, interviews and fMRIs.&lt;ref name="Clegg 2013"/&gt; It is not the method but rather its name that has been dropped from the dominant psychological vocabulary.

===Recent developments===
{{See also|Introspection illusion}}
Partly as a result of Titchener's misrepresentation, the use of introspection diminished after his death and the subsequent decline of structuralism.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; Later psychological movements, such as [[functional psychology|functionalism]] and [[behaviorism]], rejected introspection for its lack of scientific [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] among other factors.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; Functionalism originally arose in direct opposition to structuralism, opposing its narrow focus on the elements of consciousness&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; and emphasising the purpose of consciousness and other psychological behavior. Behaviorism's objection to introspection focused much more on its unreliability and [[objectivity (science)|subjectivity]] which conflicted with behaviorism's focus on measurable behavior.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences |editor-first=Robert Andrew |editor-last=Wilson |editor2=Keil, Frank C. | url = https://books.google.com/?id=-wt1aZrGXLYC&amp;printsec=frontcover | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780262731447 |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more recently established [[cognitive psychology]] movement has to some extent accepted introspection's usefulness in the study of psychological phenomena, though generally only in experiments pertaining to internal thought conducted under experimental conditions. For example, in the "[[think aloud protocol]]", investigators cue participants to speak their thoughts aloud in order to study an active thought process without forcing an individual to comment on the process itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hayes | first1 = S. C. | year = 1986 | title = The case of the silent dog—Verbal reports and the analysis of rules: A review of Ericsson and Simon's Protocol Analysis: Verbal Reports as Data1 | url = | journal = Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 351–363 | doi = 10.1901/jeab.1986.45-351 | pmc = 1348244 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in the 18th century authors had criticized the use of introspection, both for knowing one's own mind and as a method for psychology. [[David Hume]] pointed out that introspecting a mental state tends to alter the very state itself; a German author, [[Christian Gottfried Schütz]], noted that introspection is often described as mere "inner sensation", but actually requires also attention, that introspection does not get at unconscious mental states, and that it cannot be used naively - one needs to know what to look for. [[Immanuel Kant]] added that, if they are understood too narrowly, introspective experiments are impossible. Introspection delivers, at best, hints about what goes on in the mind; it does not suffice to justify knowledge claims about the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Thomas Sturm, ''Kant und die Wissenschaften vom Menschen'' (Paderborn: Mentis, 2009), ch.s 2 and 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the idea continued to be discussed between [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Auguste Comte]]. 
Recent psychological research on [[cognition]] and [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]] has asked people to report on their mental processes, for instance to say why they made a particular choice or how they arrived at a judgment. In some situations, these reports are clearly [[confabulation|confabulated]].&lt;ref name="telling"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nisbett|first=Richard E.|author2=Timothy D. Wilson|year=1977|title=Telling more than we can know: Verbal reports on mental processes|journal=Psychological Review|volume=84|issue=3|pages=231–259|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.84.3.231 }}, reprinted in {{cite book|title=Social cognition: key readings|editor=David Lewis Hamilton|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-86377-591-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, people justify choices they have not in fact made.&lt;ref name="something"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Petter|last=Johansson|author2=Lars Hall |author3=Sverker Sikström |author4=Betty Tärning |author5=Andreas Lind |title=How something can be said about telling more than we can know: On choice blindness and introspection |year=2006 |journal= Consciousness and Cognition |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=673–692 |doi=10.1016/j.concog.2006.09.004|pmid=17049881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such results undermine the idea that those verbal reports are based on direct introspective access to mental content. Instead, judgements about one's own mind seem to be [[inference]]s from overt behavior, similar to judgements made about another person.&lt;ref name="telling" /&gt; However, it is hard to assess whether these results only apply to unusual experimental situations, or if they reveal something about everyday introspection.&lt;ref name="knowing_more"&gt;{{cite journal|last=White |first=Peter A.|year=1988 |journal=British Journal of Psychology |volume=79| title=Knowing more about what we can tell: 'Introspective access' and causal report accuracy 10 years later|issue=1|pages=13–45|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1988.tb02271.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of the [[adaptive unconscious]] suggests that a very large proportion of mental processes, even "high-level" processes like goal-setting and decision-making, are inaccessible to introspection.&lt;ref name="annreview"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Timothy D.|author2=Elizabeth W. Dunn|year=2004|title=Self-Knowledge: Its Limits, Value, and Potential for Improvement|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=55|pages=493–518|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.55.090902.141954|pmid=14744224}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Indeed, it is questionable how confident researchers can be in their own introspections.

One of the central implications of dissociations between consciousness and meta-consciousness is that individuals, presumably including researchers, can misrepresent their experiences to themselves. Jack and Roepstorff assert, '...there is also a sense in which subjects simply cannot be wrong about their own experiential states.' Presumably they arrived at this conclusion by drawing on the seemingly self-evident quality of their own introspections, and assumed that it must equally apply to others. However, when we consider research on the topic, this conclusion seems less self-evident. If, for example, extensive introspection can cause people to make decisions that they later regret, then one very reasonable possibility is that the introspection caused them to 'lose touch with their feelings'. In short, empirical studies suggest that people can fail to appraise adequately (i.e. are wrong about) their own experiential states.

Another question in regards to the veracious accountability of introspection is  if researchers lack the confidence in their own introspections and those of their participants, then how can it gain legitimacy? Three strategies  are accountable: identifying behaviors that establish credibility, finding common ground that enables mutual understanding, and developing a trust that allows one to know when to give the benefit of the doubt.
That is to say, that words are only meaningful if validated by one's actions; When people report strategies, feelings or beliefs, their  behaviors must correspond with these statements if they are to be believed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(02)01970-8 | volume=6 | issue=9 | title=Establishing a legitimate relationship with introspection | journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences | pages=371–372| year=2002 | last1=Schooler | first1=Jonathan W. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when their introspections are uninformative, people still give confident descriptions of their mental processes, being "unaware of their unawareness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Timothy D.|author2=Yoav Bar-Anan|date=August 22, 2008|title=The Unseen Mind|journal=Science|volume=321|pages=1046–1047|doi=10.1126/science.1163029|pmid=18719269|issue=5892 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon has been termed the ''introspection illusion'' and has been used to explain some [[cognitive bias]]es&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pronin|first=Emily|date=January 2007|title=Perception and misperception of bias in human judgment|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=11|issue=1|pages=37–43|issn=1364-6613|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2006.11.001|pmid=17129749}}&lt;/ref&gt; and belief in some [[paranormal]] phenomena.&lt;ref name="selfismagic"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wegner|first=Daniel M.|title=Are we free?: psychology and free will|editor=John Baer |editor2=[[James C.

For example, people generally see themselves as less [[conformity|conformist]] than others, and this seems to be because they do not introspect any urge to conform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pronin|first=Emily|author2=Jonah Berger |author3=Sarah Molouki |year=2007|title=Alone in a Crowd of Sheep: Asymmetric Perceptions of Conformity and Their Roots in an Introspection Illusion|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=92|issue=4|pages=585–595|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.4.585|pmid=17469946 |url=https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1400&amp;context=marketing_papers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reliable finding is that people generally see themselves as [[bias blind spot|less biased than everyone else]], because they are not likely to introspect any biased thought processes.&lt;ref name="blindspot"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pronin|first=Emily|author2=Matthew B. Kugler|date=July 2007|title=Valuing thoughts, ignoring behavior: The introspection illusion as a source of the bias blind spot|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=43|issue=4|pages=565–578|issn=0022-1031|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2006.05.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These introspections are misleading, however, because biases work [[unconscious mind|sub-consciously]].

One experiment tried to give their subjects access to others' introspections. They made audio recordings of subjects who had been told to say whatever came into their heads as they answered a question about their own bias.&lt;ref name="blindspot" /&gt; Although subjects persuaded themselves they were unlikely to be biased, their introspective reports did not sway the assessments of observers. When subjects were explicitly told to avoid relying on introspection, their assessments of their own bias became more realistic.&lt;ref name="blindspot" /&gt;

==In religion==

===Christianity===
In [[Eastern Christianity]] some concepts addressing human needs, such as sober introspection ''([[nepsis]]''), require watchfulness of the human heart and the conflicts of the human ''[[nous]]'', heart or mind. [[Noesis|Noetic]] understanding can not be achieved by rational or discursive thought (i.e. systemization).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===Jainism===
[[Jainism|Jains]] practise ''[[pratikraman]]'' ([[Sanskrit]] "introspection"), a process of repentance of wrongdoings during their daily life, and remind themselves to refrain from doing so again. Devout Jains often do Pratikraman at least twice a day.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

=== Hinduism ===
Introspection is encouraged in schools such as [[Advaita Vedanta]]; in order for one to know their own true nature, they need to reflect and introspect on their true nature -- which is what [[meditation]] is. Especially, [[Swami Chinmayananda]] emphasised the role of introspection in five stages, outlined in his book "Self Unfoldment."

==In fiction==
Introspection (also referred to as Rufus dialogue, interior monologue, self-talk) is the fiction-writing [[mode (literature)|mode]] used to convey a character's thoughts. As explained by Renni Browne and Dave King, "One of the great gifts of literature is that it allows for the expression of unexpressed thoughts…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Renni | last=Browne |author2=King, David | title= Self-Editing for Fiction Writers: How to Edit Yourself into Print | year=2004| publisher= HarperCollins Publishers Inc. | isbn=978-0-06-054569-7 | url= | location= New York, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nancy Kress, a character's thoughts can greatly enhance a story: deepening characterization, increasing tension, and widening the scope of a story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kress|first=Nancy|year=2003|title=Make "Em Think|journal=Writer's Digest|volume=|issue=August|page=38|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As outlined by Jack M. Bickham, thought plays a critical role in both [[Scene (drama)|scene]] and [[sequel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jack M. | last=Bickham | title=Scene &amp; Structure | year=1993 | publisher=Writer's Digest Books | isbn=978-0-89879-551-6 | url= | location= Cincinnati, OH |pages= 12–22, 50–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Both [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern]] and [[Western philosophy|Western]] philosophers have studied the concept in great detail. [[Philosophy of mind]] deals with the concept of intuition.

===Eastern philosophy===
In the East intuition is mostly intertwined with [[religion]] and [[spirituality]], and various meanings exist from different religious texts.&lt;ref name="eastern"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leaman |first1=Oliver   |title=Eastern Philosophy: Key Readings |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=FLuEAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 December 2014 |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn= 0-415-17357-4 |pages=5–40 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinduism====
In Hinduism various attempts have been made to interpret the [[Vedas|Vedic]] and other esoteric texts.

For [[Sri Aurobindo]]  intuition comes under the realms of knowledge by identity, he describes the psychological plane in human (often referred to as mana in [[sanskrit]]) has two arbitrary nature, the first being imprinting of psychological experiences which is constructed through sensory information (mind seeking to become aware of external world). The second nature being the action when it seeks to be aware of itself, resulting in humans being aware of their existence or aware of being angry &amp; aware of other emotions, he terms this second nature is knowledge by identity.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=68|ps=}}
He finds that at present as the result of evolution the mind has accustomed itself to depend upon certain physiological functioning and their reactions as its normal means of entering into relation with outer material world, as a result when we seek to know about external world the dominant habit is through arriving at truth about things via as much as senses convey to us.  However, with  knowledge by identity which we currently only gives the awareness of human beings existence can be extended further to outside of ourselves resulting in intuitive knowledge.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|pp=69-71|ps=}}

He finds this intuitive knowledge was common to older humans ([[Vedic]]) and later was taken over by [[reason]] which currently organises our perception, thoughts and actions resulting in from Vedic to metaphysical philosophy and later to experimental science. he finds that this process which seems to be a decent, is actual a circle of progress.  As a lower faculty is being pushed to take up as much from a higher way of working.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=75|ps=}} He finds when self-awareness in mind is applied to own-self and the outer (other-Self), results in luminous self-manifest identity, the reason also converts itself into the form of the self-luminous intuitional knowledge.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=72|ps=}}&lt;ref name="Integral yoga"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Aurobindo |first1=  Sri  |title=The synthesis of yoga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ex6cSqqBSwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=799–800|publisher=Sri Aurobindo ashram trust |location=Pondicherry |isbn= 978-0-9415-2465-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=7|ps=}}

[[Rajneesh|Osho]] believed consciousness of human beings to be in increasing order from basic animal [[instinct]]s to intelligence and intuition, and humans being constantly living in that conscious state often moving between these states depending on their affinity and he also suggests living in the state of intuition is one of the ultimate aims of humanity.&lt;ref name="osho"&gt;{{cite book |last1= osho |first1=  Bhagwan  |title=Intuition: Knowing Beyond Logic |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=zyBfk5V5HRkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=osho+on+intuition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y8maVNOMEInzPJHLgbgN&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=24 December 2014 |pages=10–20|publisher=osho international foundation |location=New York |isbn= 0-312-27567-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Advaita]] vedanta (a school of thought) takes intuition to be an experience through which one can come in contact with and experience [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name="advaita"&gt;{{cite book |last1= M.

====Buddhism====
Buddhism finds intuition being a faculty in the mind of immediate knowledge and puts the term intuition beyond mental process of conscious [[thinking]], as the conscious intellect cannot necessarily access subconscious information, or render such information into a communicable form.&lt;ref name="Sumedho"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buddhismnow.com/2013/08/07/buddha-by-ajahn-sumedho/|title=Buddha, by  Ajahn Sumedho|work=Buddhism now}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Zen Buddhism]] various techniques have been developed to help develop ones intuitive capability, such as [[koans]] – the resolving of which leads to states of minor enlightenment ([[satori]]).

In Islam there are various scholars with varied interpretation of intuition (often termed as hads ([[Arabic]]: حدس), hitting correctly on a mark), sometimes relating the ability of having intuitive knowledge to [[prophet]]hood. 
[[Shahab al-Din Yahya ibn Habash Suhrawardi|Siháb al Din-al Suhrawadi]], in his book ''Philosophy Of Illumination'' (ishraq) finds that intuition is a knowledge acquired through illumination and is mystical in nature and also suggests mystical contemplation ([[mushahada]]) on this to bring about correct judgments.&lt;ref name="Islam1"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Lawson |first1=  Todd  |title=Reason and Inspiration in Islam: Theology, Philosophy and Mysticism in Muslim Thought |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bq9zSbNr8gIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=210–225|publisher=I.B touris co ltd |location=London |isbn=1-85043-470-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Ibn Sīnā]] finds the ability of having intuition as a "prophetic capacity" and terms it as a knowledge obtained without intentionally acquiring it. He finds that regular knowledge is based on imitation while intuitive knowledge as based on intellectual certitude.&lt;ref name="Islam2"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Kalin |first1=  Ibrahim  |title=Knowledge in Later Islamic Philosophy: Mulla Sadra on Existence, Intellect, and Intuition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H6EGwDLio0QC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=155–160|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western philosophy===
In the West, intuition does not appear as a separate field of study, and early mention and definition can be traced back to [[Plato]]. In his book ''[[Plato Republic|Republic]]'' he tries to define intuition as a fundamental capacity of human [[reason]] to comprehend the true nature of [[reality]].&lt;ref name="Plato"&gt;{{cite web |title=Plato: Education and the Value of Justice |url=http://www.philosophypages.com/hy/2h.htm |accessdate= |last = Kemerling|first = Garth|date = 12 November 2011|website = Philosophy Pages }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his works ''[[Meno (Plato)|Meno]]'' and ''[[Phaedo (Plato)|Phaedo]]'', he describes intuition as a pre-existing knowledge residing in the "soul of eternity," and a phenomenon by which one becomes conscious of pre-existing knowledge. He provides an example of mathematical truths, and posits that they are not arrived at by reason. He argues that these truths are accessed using a knowledge already present in a dormant form and accessible to our intuitive capacity. This concept by Plato is also sometimes referred to as [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]. The study was later continued by his [[Neo-platonism|followers]].&lt;ref name="Meno"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klein |first1= Jacob |title=A Commentary on Plato's Meno|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Commentary_on_Plato_s_Meno.html?id=HXI2lcrSsxIC&amp;redir_esc=y |accessdate=22 December 2014 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-43959-3 |pages=103–127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', [[René Descartes|Descartes]] refers to an intuition as a pre-existing knowledge gained through rational reasoning or discovering truth through contemplation. This definition is commonly referred to as [[logical intuition|rational intuition]].&lt;ref name="Descartes"&gt;{{cite book |last1= L. Mursell |first1=James |title=The Philosophical Review  |series=4 |volume=28 |publisher= Duke University Press |location=USA |pages=391–401 |chapter=The Function of Intuition in Descartes' Philosophy of Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later philosophers, such as [[David Hume|Hume]], have more ambiguous interpretations of intuition. Hume claims intuition is a recognition of relationships (relation of time, place, and causation) while he states that "the resemblance" (recognition of relations) "will strike the eye" (which would not require further examination) but goes on to state, "or rather in mind" – attributing intuition to power of mind, contradicting the theory of [[empiricism]].&lt;ref name="hume"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Hume|first1=David |title=A Treatise of Human Nature: Being an Attempt to introduce the experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3RIusIRd2q8C|accessdate=23 December 2014  |publisher=The Floating Press  |isbn= 9781775410676|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;{{cite book |last1=  A. Johnson|first1= Oliver|title=The Mind of David Hume: A Companion to Book I of A Treatise of Human Nature |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=fMjhcXhrv48C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=david+hume+on+intuition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lDorBgwuhQ&amp;sig=4X0cOWxYQunqi8k_8rb5R5W8lbA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ai-ZVJy8HcWHPbeQgYAB&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 December 2014  |publisher=The Floating Press |isbn= 0-252-02156-8|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]] finds intuition is thought of as basic sensory information provided by the [[cognitive]] faculty of sensibility (equivalent to what might loosely be called [[perception]]). Kant held that our [[mind]] casts all of our external intuitions in the form of [[space]], and all of our internal intuitions ([[memory]], thought) in the form of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|url= https://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=5144&amp;pageno=35|title= Critique of Pure Reason|publisher= gutenberg.org|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intuitionism]] is a position advanced by [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer]] in [[philosophy of mathematics]] derived from Kant's claim that all [[mathematics|mathematical knowledge]] is knowledge of the pure forms of the intuition – that is, intuition that is not empirical. [[Intuitionistic logic]] was devised by [[Arend Heyting]] to accommodate this position (and has been adopted by other forms of [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]] in general). It is characterized by rejecting the [[law of excluded middle]]: as a consequence it does not in general accept rules such as [[double negation elimination]] and the use of [[reductio ad absurdum]] to prove the existence of something.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Intuitions are customarily appealed to independently of any particular theory of how intuitions provide evidence for claims, and there are divergent accounts of what sort of mental state intuitions are, ranging from mere spontaneous judgment to a special presentation of a necessary truth.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lynch "Trusting Intuitions", in P. Greenough and M. Lynch (ed) ''Truth and Realism'', pp. 227-38.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in recent years a number of philosophers, especially [[George Bealer]] have tried to defend appeals to intuition against [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quinean]] doubts about [[conceptual analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Bealer "Intuition and The Autonomy of Philosophy" in M. Depaul and W. Ramsey (eds) ''Rethinking Intuition: The Psychology of Intuition and Its Role In Philosophical Inquiry'' 1998, pp. 201-239.&lt;/ref&gt; A different challenge to appeals to intuition has recently come from [[experimental philosophy|experimental philosophers]], who argue that appeals to intuition must be informed by the methods of social science.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The [[metaphilosophy|metaphilosophical]] assumption that philosophy depends on intuitions has recently been challenged by some philosophers. [[Timothy Williamson]] has argued that intuition plays no special role in philosophy practice, and that skepticism about intuition cannot be meaningfully separated from a general [[skepticism]] about judgment. On this view, there are no qualitative differences between the methods of philosophy and common sense, the sciences or mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Timothy (2008) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=YN2KGBgKwOcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false The Philosophy of Philosophy]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==

===Freud===
According to Sigmund [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], knowledge could only be attained through the intellectual manipulation of carefully made observations and rejected any other means of acquiring knowledge such as intuition, and his findings could have been an analytic turn of his mind towards the subject.&lt;ref name="Freud"&gt;{{cite book |last1=  Walker Punerr|first1= Helen |title=Sigmund Freud: His Life and Mind |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=386tCTzeb28C&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=intuition+sigmund+freud&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1DqgVLCrJcvfPYeWgLAK&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=28 December 2014  |publisher=Transaction Publishers |pages=197–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jung===
In [[Carl Jung]]'s theory of the [[Human ego|ego]], described in 1916 in ''[[Psychological Types]]'', intuition is an "irrational function", opposed most directly by sensation, and opposed less strongly by the "rational functions" of thinking and feeling. Jung defined intuition as "perception via the unconscious": using sense-perception only as a starting point, to bring forth ideas, images, possibilities, ways out of a blocked situation, by a process that is mostly unconscious.&lt;ref name=ptypes /&gt;

Jung said that a person in whom intuition is dominant, an "intuitive type", acts not on the basis of rational judgment but on sheer intensity of perception. An extraverted intuitive type, "the natural champion of all minorities with a future", orients to new and promising but unproven possibilities, often leaving to chase after a new possibility before old ventures have borne fruit, oblivious to his or her own welfare in the constant pursuit of change. An introverted intuitive type orients by images from the unconscious, ever exploring the psychic world of the [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]], seeking to perceive the meaning of events, but often having no interest in playing a role in those events and not seeing any connection between the contents of the psychic world and him- or herself. Jung thought that extraverted intuitive types were likely entrepreneurs, speculators, cultural revolutionaries, often undone by a desire to escape every situation before it becomes settled and constraining—even repeatedly leaving lovers for the sake of new romantic possibilities. His introverted intuitive types were likely mystics, prophets, or cranks, struggling with a tension between protecting their visions from influence by others and making their ideas comprehensible and reasonably persuasive to others—a necessity for those visions to bear real fruit.&lt;ref name=ptypes&gt;C.G. Jung. ''Psychological Types''. Bollingen Series XX, Volume 6, Princeton University Press, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern psychology===
In more-recent psychology, intuition can encompass the ability to know valid solutions to problems and [[decision making]]. For example, the [[recognition primed decision]] (RPD) model explains how people can make relatively fast decisions without having to compare options. [[Gary A. Klein|Gary Klein]] found that under time pressure, high stakes, and changing parameters, experts used their base of experience to identify similar situations and intuitively choose feasible solutions. Thus, the RPD model is a blend of intuition and analysis. The intuition is the pattern-matching process that quickly suggests feasible courses of action. The [[analysis]] is the mental simulation, a conscious and deliberate review of the courses of action.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Gary. ''Intuition At Work''. Random House, NY, NY. January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Instinct]] is often misinterpreted as intuition and its reliability considered to be dependent on past knowledge and occurrences in a specific area. For example, someone who has had more experiences with children will tend to have a better instinct about what they should do in certain situations with them. This is not to say that one with a great amount of experience is always going to have an accurate intuition.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Sadler-Smith. Inside Intuition. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intuitive abilities were quantitatively tested at Yale University in the 1970s. While studying [[nonverbal communication]], researchers noted that some subjects were able to read nonverbal facial cues before reinforcement occurred.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini, J Daood, MC Giannini, R Boniface, PG Rhodes. Intellect versus intuition--dichotomy in the reception of nonverbal communication.Journal of General Psychology. 99:19-24,1978.&lt;/ref&gt; In employing a similar design, they noted that highly intuitive subjects made decisions quickly but could not identify their rationale. Their level of accuracy, however, did not differ from that of non intuitive subjects.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini, ME Barringer, MC Giannini, RH Loiselle. Lack of relationship between handedness and intuitive and intellectual (rationalistic) modes of information processing. Journal of General Psychology. 111:31-37 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colloquial usage==
Intuition, as a gut feeling based on experience, has been found to be useful for business leaders for making judgement about people, culture and strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epubs.scu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&amp;context=gcm_pubs|title=Australian Elite Leaders, Intuition and Effectiveness |publisher=epubs.scu.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement officers often claim to observe suspects and immediately "know" that they possess a weapon or illicit narcotic substances, which could also be action of [[instinct]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/concept-creep/477939/|title=Why Americans Are So Sensitive to Harm|first=Conor|last=Friedersdorf|date=|website=theatlantic.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often unable to articulate why they reacted or what prompted them at the time of the event, they sometimes retrospectively can plot their actions based upon what had been clear and present danger signals. Such examples liken intuition to "[[Feeling#Stomach feeling|gut feelings]]" and when viable illustrate [[preconscious]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J. Pinizzotto, PhD, Edward F. Davis, MA, and Charles E. Miller III [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Emotional%2Frational+decision+making+in+law+enforcement-a0114370262 Emotional/rational decision making in law enforcement] (Federal Bureau of Investigation), ''Free Online Library'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
[[Intuition Peak]] in [[Antarctica]] is so named "in appreciation of the role of scientific intuition for the advancement of human knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=134566 Intuition Peak.] SCAR [[Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liberalism''' is a [[Political philosophy|political]] and [[moral philosophy]] based on [[liberty]] and [[Egalitarianism|equality]].&lt;ref&gt;"liberalism In general, the belief that it is the aim of politics to preserve individual rights and to maximize freedom of choice."

Liberalism became a distinct [[Political movement|movement]] in the [[Age of Enlightenment]], when it became popular among [[Western world|Western]] philosophers and economists. Liberalism sought to replace the [[Norm (social)|norms]] of [[Nobility|hereditary privilege]], [[state religion]], [[absolute monarchy]], the [[divine right of kings]] and [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditional conservatism]] with [[representative democracy]] and the [[rule of law]]. Liberals also ended [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] policies, [[Legal monopoly|royal monopolies]] and other [[Trade barrier|barriers to trade]], instead promoting free markets.&lt;ref name="Gould, p. 3"/&gt; Philosopher [[John Locke]] is often credited with founding liberalism as a distinct tradition, arguing that each man has a [[Natural and legal rights|natural right]] to [[life, liberty and property]],&lt;ref&gt;"All mankind [...] being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions", John Locke, ''Second Treatise of Government''&lt;/ref&gt; adding that governments must not violate these [[rights]] based on the [[social contract]]. While the [[Gladstonian liberalism|British liberal tradition]] has emphasised expanding democracy, [[Liberalism and radicalism in France|French liberalism]] has emphasised rejecting [[authoritarianism]] and is linked to [[Nationalism|nation-building]].&lt;ref name="Kirchner, p. 3"&gt;Kirchner, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

These changes, along with other factors, helped to create a sense of crisis within [[Islam]], which continues to this day, leading to [[Islamic revivalism]]. Before 1920, the main ideological opponent of [[classical liberalism]] was [[conservatism]], but liberalism then faced major ideological challenges from new opponents: [[fascism]] and [[communism]]. However, during the 20th century liberal ideas also spread even further—especially in Western Europe—as [[Liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] found themselves on the winning side in both world wars.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Conway.

In Europe and North America, the establishment of [[social liberalism]] (often called simply "[[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]]" in the United States) became a key component in the expansion of the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/schleslib.html "Liberalism in America: A Note for Europeans"] by [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] (1956) from: ''The Politics of Hope'' (Boston: Riverside Press, 1962). "Liberalism in the U.S. usage has little in common with the word as used in the politics of any other country, save possibly Britain."&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[Liberal Party|liberal parties]] continue to wield power and influence [[Liberalism by country|throughout the world]]. However, liberalism still has challenges to overcome in Africa and Asia. The fundamental elements of [[Modernity|contemporary society]] have liberal roots. The early waves of liberalism popularised economic individualism while expanding [[constitution]]al [[government]] and [[parliament]]ary authority.&lt;ref name="Gould, p. 3"&gt;Gould, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Liberals sought and established a constitutional order that prized important [[Civil liberties|individual freedoms]], such as  [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of association]]; an [[Independence of the judiciary|independent judiciary]] and public [[Jury trial|trial by jury]]; and the abolition of [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] privileges.&lt;ref name="Gould, p. 3"/&gt; Later waves of modern liberal thought and struggle were strongly influenced by the need to expand civil rights.&lt;ref name="Worell470"&gt;Worell, p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt; Liberals have [[Advocacy|advocated]] gender and racial equality in their drive to promote civil rights and a [[Civil rights movements|global civil rights movement]] in the 20th century achieved several objectives towards both goals. Continental European liberalism is divided between [[moderate]]s and [[Progressivism|progressives]], with the moderates tending to [[elitism]] and the progressives supporting the universalisation of fundamental institutions, such as [[universal suffrage]], [[Universal access to education|universal education]] and the expansion of [[Property|property rights]]. Over time, the moderates displaced the progressives as the main guardians of continental European liberalism.&lt;ref name="Kirchner, p. 3"/&gt;

== Etymology and definition ==
Words such as [[wikt:Liberal|liberal]], [[wikt:Liberty|liberty]], [[wikt:Libertarianism|libertarian]] and [[libertine]] all trace their history to the Latin ''[[wikt:Liber|liber]]'', which means "[[wikt:Free|free]]".&lt;ref name="Gross, p. 5"&gt;Gross, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first recorded instances of the word "liberal" occurs in 1375, when it was used to describe the [[liberal arts]] in the context of an education desirable for a free-born man.&lt;ref name="Gross, p. 5"/&gt; The word's early connection with the classical education of a medieval university soon gave way to a proliferation of different denotations and connotations. "Liberal" could refer to "free in bestowing" as early as 1387, "made without stint" in 1433, "freely permitted" in 1530 and "free from restraint"—often as a pejorative remark—in the 16th and the 17th centuries.&lt;ref name="Gross, p. 5"/&gt; In 16th century [[Kingdom of England|England]], "liberal" could have positive or negative attributes in referring to someone's generosity or indiscretion.&lt;ref name="Gross, p. 5"/&gt; In ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', [[William Shakespeare]] wrote of "a liberal villaine" who "hath [...] confest his vile encounters".&lt;ref name="Gross, p. 5"/&gt; With the rise of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the word acquired decisively more positive undertones, being defined as "free from narrow prejudice" in 1781 and "free from bigotry" in 1823.&lt;ref name="Gross, p. 5"/&gt; In 1815, the first use of the word "liberalism" appeared in English.&lt;ref&gt;Kirchner, pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, the ''[[Liberalism and radicalism in Spain|liberales]]'', the first group to use the liberal label in a political context,&lt;ref&gt;Colton and Palmer, p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt; fought for decades for the implementation of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|1812 Constitution]]. From 1820 to 1823 during the ''[[Trienio Liberal]]'', [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|King Ferdinand VII]] was compelled by the ''liberales'' to swear to uphold the Constitution. By the middle of the 19th century, "liberal" was used as a politicised term for parties and movements worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Emil J. Kirchner, ''Liberal Parties in Western Europe'', "Liberal parties were among the first political parties to form, and their long-serving and influential records, as participants in parliaments and governments, raise important questions [...]", Cambridge University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|978-0-521-32394-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the meaning of the word "liberalism" began to diverge in different parts of the world. According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'': "In the United States, liberalism is associated with the welfare-state policies of the New Deal programme of the Democratic administration of Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt, whereas in Europe it is more commonly associated with a commitment to limited government and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic policies".&lt;ref&gt;"Liberalism", ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in the United States the ideas of [[individualism]] and ''laissez-faire'' economics previously associated with classical liberalism became the basis for the emerging school of [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] thought&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard121.html ''The Libertarian Heritage: The American Revolution and Classical Liberalism]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and are key components of [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]].

Unlike Europe and Latin America, the word "liberalism" in North America almost exclusively refers to social liberalism. The dominant Canadian party is the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] and the United States' [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] is usually considered liberal.&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, p. 142. "After a dozen years of centre-left Liberal Party rule, the Conservative Party emerged from the 2006 parliamentary elections with a plurality and established a fragile minority government."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, pp. 106–07. [Talking about the Democratic Party] "Its liberalism is for the most part the later version of liberalism – modern liberalism."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, p. 3. "Modern liberalism occupies the left-of-center in the traditional political spectrum and is represented by the Democratic Party in the United States."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Liberalism—both as a political current and an intellectual tradition—is mostly a modern phenomenon that started in the 17th century, although some liberal philosophical ideas had precursors in [[classical antiquity]] and in [[History of China#Imperial China|Imperial China]].&lt;ref name="BevirSAGE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FungCambridge"/&gt; The [[List of Roman Emperors|Roman Emperor]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] praised, "the idea of a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly government which respects most of all the freedom of the governed".&lt;ref&gt;Antoninus, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have also recognised a number of principles familiar to contemporary liberals in the works of several [[Sophism|Sophists]] and in the ''Funeral Oration'' by [[Pericles]].&lt;ref name="Young, pp. 25–6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=25–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal philosophy symbolises an extensive intellectual tradition that has examined and popularised some of the most important and controversial principles of the modern world. Its immense scholarly and academic output has been characterised as containing "richness and diversity", but that diversity often has meant that liberalism comes in different formulations and presents a challenge to anyone looking for a clear definition.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Major themes ===
{{Individualism sidebar|expanded=Philosophies}}
Though all liberal doctrines possess a common heritage, scholars frequently assume that those doctrines contain "separate and often contradictory streams of thought".&lt;ref name="Young, p. 24"/&gt; The objectives of [[List of liberal theorists|liberal theorists and philosophers]] have differed across various times, cultures and continents. The diversity of liberalism can be gleaned from the numerous adjectives that liberal thinkers and movements have attached to the very term "liberalism", including [[Classical liberalism|classical]], [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]], [[Economic liberalism|economic]], [[Social liberalism|social]], [[welfare state]], [[Ethics|ethical]], [[Humanism|humanist]], [[Deontological ethics|deontological]], [[Perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionist]], [[Democracy|democratic]] and [[institution]]al,  to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these variations, liberal thought does exhibit a few definite and fundamental conceptions. At its very root, liberalism is a philosophy about the meaning of humanity and society.

Political philosopher [[John Gray (philosopher)|John Gray]] identified the common strands in liberal thought as being individualist, egalitarian, [[meliorism|meliorist]] and [[Universalism|universalist]]. The individualist element avers the ethical primacy of the human being against the pressures of social [[collectivism]], the egalitarian element assigns the same [[Morality|moral]] worth and status to all individuals, the meliorist element asserts that successive generations can improve their sociopolitical arrangements and the universalist element affirms the moral unity of the human species and marginalises local [[Culture|cultural]] differences.&lt;ref name="Gray, p. xii"&gt;Gray, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; The meliorist element has been the subject of much controversy, defended by thinkers such as [[Immanuel Kant]] who believed in human progress while suffering criticism by thinkers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who instead believed that human attempts to improve themselves through social [[cooperation]] would fail.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, pp. 33–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the liberal temperament, Gray claimed that it "has been inspired by scepticism and by a fideistic certainty of divine revelation&amp;nbsp;[...] it has exalted the power of reason even as, in other contexts, it has sought to humble reason's claims".{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The liberal philosophical tradition has searched for validation and justification through several intellectual projects. The moral and political suppositions of liberalism have been based on traditions such as natural rights and [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian theory]], although sometimes liberals even requested support from scientific and religious circles.&lt;ref name="Gray, p. xii"/&gt; Through all these strands and traditions, scholars have identified the following major common facets of liberal thought: believing in equality and [[individual liberty]], supporting private property and individual rights, supporting the idea of limited constitutional government, and recognising the importance of related values such as [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], [[toleration]], autonomy, [[bodily integrity]] and [[Consent of the governed|consent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classical and modern ===
Enlightenment philosophers are given credit for shaping liberal ideas. These ideas were first drawn together and systematized as a distinct [[ideology]] by the English philosopher [[John Locke]], generally regarded as the father of modern liberalism.&lt;ref name="Delaney, p. 18"&gt;Delaney, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Godwin et al., p. 12"&gt;Godwin et al., p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hobbes]] attempted to determine the purpose and the justification of governing authority in a post-civil war England. Employing the idea of a state of nature—a hypothetical war-like scenario prior to the state—he constructed the idea of a social contract that individuals enter into to guarantee their security and in so doing form the State, concluding that only an absolute sovereign would be fully able to sustain such a peace. Hobbes had developed the concept of the social contract, according to which individuals in the anarchic and brutal state of nature came together and voluntarily ceded some of their individual rights to an established state authority, which would create laws to regulate social interactions. Whereas Hobbes advocated a strong monarchical authority (the [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]), Locke developed the then radical notion that government acquires [[Consent of the governed|consent from the governed]] which has to be constantly present for the government to remain legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;Copleston, pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; While adopting Hobbes's idea of a state of nature and social contract, Locke nevertheless argued that when the monarch becomes a tyrant, it constituted a violation of the social contract, which bestows life, liberty and property as a natural right. He concluded that the people have a right to overthrow a tyrant. By placing life, liberty and property as the supreme value of law and authority, Locke formulated the basis of liberalism based on social contract theory. To these early enlightenment thinkers, securing the most essential amenities of life—[[liberty]] and [[private property]] among them—required the formation of a "sovereign" authority with universal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His influential ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Two Treatises]]'' (1690), the foundational text of liberal ideology, outlined his major ideas. Once humans moved out of their [[State of nature|natural state]] and formed societies, Locke argued as follows: "Thus that which begins and actually constitutes any [[State (polity)|political society]] is nothing but the consent of any number of freemen capable of a majority to unite and incorporate into such a society. And this is that, and that only, which did or could give beginning to any lawful government in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Locke, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; The stringent insistence that lawful government did not have a [[supernatural]] basis was a sharp break with the dominant theories of governance which advocated the divine right of kings&lt;ref&gt;Forster, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; and echoed the earlier thought of [[Aristotle]]. One political scientist described this new thinking as follows: "In the liberal understanding, there are no citizens within the regime who can claim to rule by natural or supernatural right, without the consent of the governed".&lt;ref&gt;Zvesper, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke had other intellectual opponents besides Hobbes. In the ''First Treatise'', Locke aimed his guns first and foremost at one of the doyens of 17th century English conservative philosophy: [[Robert Filmer]]. Filmer's ''Patriarcha'' (1680) argued for the [[divine right of kings]] by appealing to [[Bible|biblical]] teaching, claiming that the authority granted to [[Adam]] by [[God]] gave successors of Adam in the male line of descent a right of dominion over all other humans and creatures in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Copleston, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Locke disagreed so thoroughly and obsessively with Filmer that the ''First Treatise'' is almost a sentence-by-sentence refutation of ''Patriarcha''. Reinforcing his respect for consensus, Locke argued that "conjugal society is made up by a voluntary compact between men and women".&lt;ref name="Kerber, p. 189"&gt;Kerber, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke maintained that the grant of dominion in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] was not to [[Male privilege|men over women]], as Filmer believed, but to humans over animals.&lt;ref name="Kerber, p. 189"/&gt; Locke was certainly no [[feminism|feminist]] by modern standards, but the first major liberal thinker in history accomplished an equally major task on the road to making the world more pluralistic: the integration of women into [[social theory]].&lt;ref name="Kerber, p. 189"/&gt;

[[File:Areopagitica 1644bw gobeirne.png|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'' (1644) argued for the importance of [[freedom of speech]]]]
Locke also originated the concept of the [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, p. 29 ("It took [[John Locke]] to translate the demand for liberty of conscience into a systematic argument for distinguishing the realm of government from the realm of religion.")&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the social contract principle, Locke argued that the government lacked authority in the realm of individual conscience, as this was something rational people could not cede to the government for it or others to control. For Locke, this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience, which he argued must therefore remain protected from any government authority.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; He also formulated a general defence for [[religious toleration]] in his ''Letters Concerning Toleration''. Three arguments are central: (1) earthly judges, the state in particular, and human beings generally, cannot dependably evaluate the truth-claims of competing religious standpoints; (2) even if they could, enforcing a single "[[Supremacism#Religious|true religion]]" would not have the desired effect because belief cannot be compelled by [[Religious violence|violence]]; (3) coercing religious uniformity would lead to more social disorder than allowing diversity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alister McGrath|McGrath, Alister]]. 1998. ''Historical Theology, An Introduction to the History of Christian Thought.'' Oxford: Blackwell Publishers. pp. 214–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke was also influenced by the liberal ideas of [[Presbyterian]] politician and poet [[John Milton]], who was a staunch advocate of freedom in all its forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Heinrich | last = Bornkamm | language = German | contribution = Toleranz. In der Geschichte des Christentums | title = Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart | year = 1962}}, 3. Auflage, Band VI, col. 942&lt;/ref&gt; Milton argued for [[disestablishment]] as the only effective way of achieving broad [[Religious toleration|toleration]]. Rather than force a man's conscience, government should recognise the persuasive force of the gospel.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, William Bridges. ''A Milton Encyclopedia, Volume 8'' (East Brunswick, NJ: Associated University Presses, 1980). pp. 71, 72. {{ISBN|0-8387-1841-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As assistant to [[Oliver Cromwell]], Milton also took part in drafting a constitution of the [[Independent politician|independents]] (''Agreement of the People''; 1647) that strongly stressed the equality of all humans as a consequence of democratic tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = W | last = Wertenbruch | contribution = Menschenrechte | title = Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart | language = German | place = Tübingen, DE | year = 1960}}, 3. Auflage, Band IV, col. 869&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Areopagitica]]'', Milton provided one of the first arguments for the importance of freedom of speech—"the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties". His central argument was that the individual is capable of using reason to distinguish right from wrong. To be able to exercise this right, everyone must have unlimited access to the ideas of his fellow men in "[[Marketplace of ideas|a free and open encounter]]" and this will allow the good arguments to prevail.

In a natural state of affairs, liberals argued, humans were driven by the instincts of survival and [[self-preservation]] and the only way to escape from such a dangerous existence was to form a common and supreme power capable of arbitrating between competing human desires.&lt;ref name="Young 30"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This power could be formed in the framework of a [[civil society]] that allows individuals to make a voluntary social contract with the sovereign authority, transferring their natural rights to that authority in return for the protection of life, liberty and property.&lt;ref name="Young 30" /&gt; These early liberals often disagreed about the most appropriate form of government, but they all shared the belief that liberty was natural and that its restriction needed strong justification.&lt;ref name="Young 30" /&gt; Liberals generally believed in limited government, although several liberal philosophers decried government outright, with [[Thomas Paine]] writing "government even in its best state is a necessary evil".&lt;ref name="Young, p. 31"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the project to limit the powers of government, various liberal theorists such as [[James Madison]] and [[Montesquieu]] conceived the notion of [[separation of powers]], a system designed to equally distribute governmental authority among the [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[Legislature|legislative]] and [[Judiciary|judicial]] branches.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 31" /&gt; Governments had to realise, liberals maintained, that poor and improper governance gave the people authority to overthrow the ruling order through any and all possible means, even through outright violence and [[revolution]], if needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary liberals, heavily influenced by social liberalism, have continued to support limited [[Constitution#Governmental constitutions|constitutional government]] while also advocating for [[Social services|state services]] and [[Provisioning|provisions]] to ensure equal rights. Modern liberals claim that formal or official guarantees of individual rights are irrelevant when individuals lack the material means to benefit from those rights and call for a [[Economic interventionism|greater role for government]] in the administration of economic affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=32–33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Early liberals also laid the groundwork for the separation of church and state. As heirs of the Enlightenment, liberals believed that any given social and political order emanated [[Consent of the governed|from human interactions]], not from [[Divine law|divine will]].&lt;ref name="Gould, p. 4"&gt;Gould, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Many liberals were openly hostile to [[religious belief]] itself, but most concentrated their opposition to the union of religious and political authority, arguing that faith could prosper on its own, without official sponsorship or administration by the state.&lt;ref name="Gould, p. 4"/&gt;

Beyond identifying a clear role for government in modern society, liberals also have obsessed over the meaning and nature of the most important principle in liberal philosophy, namely liberty. From the 17th century until the 19th century, liberals (from [[Adam Smith]] to [[John Stuart Mill]]) conceptualised liberty as the absence of interference from government and from other individuals, claiming that all people should have the freedom to develop their own unique abilities and capacities without being sabotaged by others.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mill's ''[[On Liberty]]'' (1859), one of the classic texts in liberal philosophy, proclaimed, "the only freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way".&lt;ref name="Young, p. 33"/&gt; Support for ''laissez-faire'' [[capitalism]] is often associated with this principle, with [[Friedrich Hayek]] arguing in ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' (1944) that reliance on free markets would preclude totalitarian control by the state.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thomashillgreen.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Thomas Hill Green]] was an influential [[List of liberal theorists|liberal philosopher]] who in ''Prolegomena to Ethics'' (1884) established the first major foundations for what later became known as [[positive liberty]] and in a few years his ideas became the [[Liberal welfare reforms|official policy]] of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in [[Liberalism in the United Kingdom|Britain]], precipitating the rise of social liberalism and the modern [[welfare state]]]]
The development into maturity of classical liberalism took place before and after the French Revolution [[Liberalism in the United Kingdom|in Britain]] and was based on the following core concepts: [[classical economics]], [[free trade]], ''laissez-faire'' government with minimal intervention and taxation and a [[balanced budget]]. Classical liberals were committed to individualism, liberty and equal rights. Writers such as [[John Bright]] and [[Richard Cobden]] opposed both aristocratic privilege and property, which they saw as an impediment to the development of a class of [[yeoman]] farmers.&lt;ref name="Vincent, pp. 29–30"&gt;Vincent, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 19th century, a new conception of liberty entered the liberal intellectual arena. This new kind of liberty became known as [[positive liberty]] to distinguish it from the prior [[negative liberty|negative version]] and it was first developed by [[British philosophy|British philosopher]] [[Thomas Hill Green]]. Green rejected the idea that humans were driven solely by [[self-interest]], emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of our [[moral character]].&lt;ref name="Adams, pp. 54–5"&gt;Adams, pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; In a very profound step for the future of modern liberalism, he also tasked society and political institutions with the enhancement of individual freedom and identity and the development of moral character, will and reason and the state to create the conditions that allow for the above, giving the opportunity for genuine [[choice]].&lt;ref name="Adams, pp. 54–5"/&gt; Foreshadowing the new liberty as the freedom to act rather than to avoid suffering from the acts of others, Green wrote the following: {{quote|If it were ever reasonable to wish that the usage of words had been other than it has been [...] one might be inclined to wish that the term 'freedom' had been confined to the [...] power to do what one wills.&lt;ref&gt;Wempe, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Rather than previous liberal conceptions viewing society as populated by selfish individuals, Green viewed society as an organic whole in which all individuals have a [[duty]] to promote the [[common good]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas spread rapidly and were developed by other thinkers such as [[Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse]] and [[John A. Hobson]]. In a few years, this ''New Liberalism'' had become the essential social and political programme of the Liberal Party in Britain&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; and it would encircle much of the world in the 20th century. In addition to examining negative and positive liberty, liberals have tried to understand the proper relationship between liberty and democracy. As they struggled to expand [[Universal suffrage|suffrage rights]], liberals increasingly understood that people left out of the [[Voting|democratic decision-making process]] were liable to the "[[tyranny of the majority]]", a concept explained in Mill's ''On Liberty'' and in ''[[Democracy in America]]'' (1835) by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]].&lt;ref name="Young, p. 36"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a response, liberals began demanding proper safeguards to thwart majorities in their attempts at suppressing the [[Minority rights|rights of minorities]].&lt;ref name="Young, p. 36"/&gt;

Besides liberty, liberals have developed several other principles important to the construction of their philosophical structure, such as equality, pluralism and toleration. Highlighting the confusion over the first principle, [[Voltaire]] commented that "equality is at once the most natural and at times the most chimeral of things".&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; All forms of liberalism assume in some basic sense that individuals are equal.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In maintaining that people are naturally equal, liberals assume that they all possess the same right to liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=39–40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, no one is inherently entitled to enjoy the benefits of liberal society more than anyone else and all people are [[Equality before the law|equal subjects before the law]].&lt;ref name="Young, p. 40"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this basic conception, liberal theorists diverge on their understanding of equality. American philosopher [[John Rawls]] emphasised the need to ensure not only equality under the law, but also the equal distribution of material resources that individuals required to develop their [[Motivation|aspirations]] in life.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 40"/&gt; Libertarian thinker [[Robert Nozick]] disagreed with Rawls, championing the former version of [[Equal opportunity|Lockean equality]] instead.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 40"/&gt;

To contribute to the development of liberty, liberals also have promoted concepts like pluralism and toleration. By pluralism, liberals refer to the proliferation of opinions and beliefs that characterise a stable [[social order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=42–43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many of their competitors and predecessors, liberals do not seek conformity and homogeneity in the way that people think. In fact, their efforts have been geared towards establishing a governing framework that [[Conflict resolution|harmonises and minimises conflicting views]], but still allows those views to exist and flourish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For liberal philosophy, pluralism leads easily to toleration. Since individuals will hold diverging viewpoints, liberals argue, they ought to uphold and respect the right of one another to disagree.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 44"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the liberal perspective, toleration was initially connected to [[religious toleration]], with [[Baruch Spinoza]] condemning "the stupidity of religious persecution and ideological wars".&lt;ref name="Young, p. 44"/&gt; Toleration also played a central role in the [[Kantianism|ideas of Kant]] and John Stuart Mill. Both thinkers believed that society will contain different conceptions of a good ethical life and that people should be allowed to make their own choices without interference from the state or other individuals.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 44"/&gt;

=== Liberal economic theory ===
{{main|Economic liberalism}}
[[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, was to provide most of the ideas of economics at least until the publication of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''Principles'' in 1848.&lt;ref name="Mills, pp. 63, 68"&gt;Mills, pp. 63, 68&lt;/ref&gt; Smith addressed the motivation for economic activity, the causes of [[Pricing|prices]] and the [[distribution of wealth]] and the [[Economic policy|policies]] the state should follow in order to maximise [[wealth]].&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 64"&gt;Mills, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith wrote that as long as [[Supply and demand|supply, demand]], [[price]]s and [[Competition (economics)|competition]] were left free of government regulation, the pursuit of material self-interest, rather than altruism, would maximise the wealth of a society&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KpWg1DYxRTwC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=%22public+good%22&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=%22public%20good%22 The Wealth of Nations]'', Strahan and Cadell, 1778&lt;/ref&gt; through profit-driven production of goods and services. An "[[invisible hand]]" directed individuals and firms to work toward the nation's good as an unintended consequence of efforts to maximise their own gain. This provided a moral justification for the accumulation of wealth, which had previously been viewed by some as sinful.&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 64"/&gt;

Smith assumed that workers could be [[Salary|paid]] as low as was necessary for their survival, which was later transformed by [[David Ricardo]] and [[Thomas Robert Malthus]] into the "[[iron law of wages]]".&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; His main emphasis was on the benefit of free internal and [[international trade]], which he thought could increase wealth through specialisation in production.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; He also opposed restrictive [[trade preference]]s, state grants of [[Monopoly|monopolies]] and [[employers' organisation]]s and [[trade union]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Government should be limited to defence, [[public work]]s and the [[administration of justice]], financed by [[Income tax|taxes based on income]].&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was one of the progenitors of the idea, which was long central to classical liberalism and has resurfaced in the [[globalisation]] literature of the later 20th and early 21st centuries, that free trade promotes peace.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's economics was carried into practice in the 19th century with the lowering of tariffs in the 1820s, the repeal of the [[Poor Relief Act 1662|Poor Relief Act]] that had restricted the mobility of labour in 1834 and the end of the rule of the [[East India Company]] over India in 1858.&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 69"&gt;Mills, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Smith's legacy, [[Say's law]], Malthus theories of population and Ricardo's iron law of wages became central doctrines of classical economics.&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 76"&gt;Mills, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Baptiste Say]] challenged Smith's [[labour theory of value]], believing that prices were determined by utility and also emphasised the critical role of the entrepreneur in the economy. However, neither of those observations became accepted by British economists at the time. Malthus wrote ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' in 1798,&lt;ref&gt;Mills, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; becoming a major influence on classical liberalism. Malthus claimed that population growth would outstrip food production because population grew geometrically while food production grew arithmetically. As people were provided with food, they would reproduce until their growth outstripped the food supply. Nature would then provide a check to growth in the forms of vice and misery. No gains in income could prevent this and any welfare for the poor would be self-defeating. The poor were in fact responsible for their own problems which could have been avoided through self-restraint.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several liberals, including Adam Smith and Richard Cobden, argued that the free exchange of goods between nations would lead to world peace.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gartzke, "Economic Freedom and Peace," in ''Economic Freedom of the World: 2005 Annual Report'' (Vancouver: Fraser Institute, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Smith argued that as societies progressed the spoils of war would rise, but the costs of war would rise further, making war difficult and costly for industrialised nations.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Doyle, ''Ways of War and Peace: Realism, Liberalism, and Socialism'' (New York: Norton, 1997), p. 237 ({{ISBN|0-393-96947-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Cobden believed that military expenditures worsened the welfare of the state and benefited a small but concentrated elite minority, summing up British [[imperialism]], which he believed was the result of the economic restrictions of mercantilist policies. To Cobden and many classical liberals, those who advocated peace must also advocate free markets.

[[Utilitarianism]] provided the [[Legitimacy (political)|political justification]] for the implementation of [[economic liberalism]] by British governments, which was to dominate economic policy from the 1830s. Although utilitarianism prompted legislative and administrative reform and John Stuart Mill's later writings on the subject foreshadowed the welfare state, it was mainly used as a justification for ''laissez-faire''.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The central concept of utilitarianism, which was developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]], was that [[public policy]] should seek to provide "the greatest happiness of the greatest number". While this could be interpreted as a justification for state action to [[Poverty reduction|reduce poverty]], it was used by classical liberals to justify inaction with the argument that the net benefit to all individuals would be higher.&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 76"&gt;Mills, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophy proved to be extremely influential on government policy and led to increased Benthamite attempts at government [[social control]], including [[Robert Peel]]'s [[Metropolitan Police]], [[prison reform]]s, the [[workhouse]]s and [[History of psychiatric institutions|asylums]] for the mentally ill.

==== Keynesian economics ====
{{main|Keynesian economics}}
[[File:Keynes 1933.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Maynard Keynes]] was one of the most influential economists of modern times and whose ideas, which are still [[2008–09 Keynesian resurgence|widely felt]], formalized modern [[liberal economic]] policy]]

During the [[Great Depression]], the definitive liberal response to it was given by the English economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883–1946). Keynes had been "brought up" as a classical liberal, but especially after World War I became increasingly a welfare or social liberal.&lt;ref&gt;See studies of Keynes by, e.g., [[Roy Harrod]], [[Robert Skidelsky]], Donald Moggridge, and [[Donald Markwell]].&lt;/ref&gt; A prolific writer, among many other works, he had begun a theoretical work examining the relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pressman|first=Steven|title=Fifty Great Economists|year=1999|isbn=0-415-13481-1|pages=96–100|publisher=London: Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Keynes was deeply critical of the British government's [[austerity]] measures [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|during the Great Depression]]. He believed that [[budget deficit]]s were a good thing, a product of [[recession]]s. He wrote: "For Government borrowing of one kind or another is nature's remedy, so to speak, for preventing business losses from being, in so severe a slump as to present one, so great as to bring production altogether to a standstill".&lt;ref name="Cassidy2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cassidy|first=John|title=The Demand Doctor|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of the Great Depression in 1933, Keynes published ''The Means to Prosperity'', which contained specific policy recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter cyclical public spending. ''The Means to Prosperity'' contains one of the first mentions of the [[multiplier effect]].&lt;ref name="Skid30s"&gt;{{cite book|last=Skidelsky|first=Robert|title=John Maynard Keynes: 1883–1946: Economist, Philosopher, Statesman|year=2003|isbn=0-330-488678|pages=494–500, 504, 509–510|publisher=Pan MacMillan Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keynes's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', was published in 1936&lt;ref&gt;Keith Tribe, ''Economic careers: economics and economists in Britain, 1930–1970'' (1997), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; and served as a theoretical justification for the [[Economic interventionism|interventionist policies]] Keynes favoured for tackling a recession. The ''General Theory'' challenged the earlier [[neo-classical economics|neo-classical economic]] paradigm, which had held that provided it was unfettered by government interference, the [[Market (economics)|market]] would naturally establish [[full employment]] equilibrium. [[Classical economics|Classical economists]] had believed in [[Say's law]], which simply put states that "[[supply creates its own demand]]" and that in a [[free market]] workers would always be willing to lower their wages to a level where employers could profitably offer them jobs. An innovation from Keynes was the concept of [[Sticky (economics)|price stickiness]], i.e. the recognition that in reality workers often refuse to lower their wage demands even in cases where a classical economist might argue it is [[rationality|rational]] for them to do so. Due in part to price stickiness, it was established that the interaction of "[[aggregate demand]]" and "[[aggregate supply]]" may lead to stable unemployment equilibria and in those cases it is the state and not the market that economies must depend on for their salvation. The book advocated activist economic policy by government to stimulate demand in times of high unemployment, for example by spending on public works. In 1928, he wrote: "Let us be up and doing, using our idle resources to increase our wealth. [...] With men and plants unemployed, it is ridiculous to say that we cannot afford these new developments. It is precisely with these plants and these men that we shall afford them".&lt;ref name="Cassidy2011"/&gt; Where the market failed to properly allocate resources, the government was required to stimulate the economy until private funds could start flowing again—a "prime the pump" kind of strategy designed to boost [[industrial production]].&lt;ref&gt;Colton and Palmer, p. 808.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liberal feminist theory ===
{{main|Liberal feminism}}
[[File:Mary Wollstonecraft by John Opie (c. 1797).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mary Wollstonecraft]], widely regarded as the pioneer of [[liberal feminism]]]]
[[Liberal feminism]], the dominant tradition in [[History of feminism|feminist history]], is an [[Individualism|individualistic]] form of [[feminist theory]] which focuses on women's ability to maintain their equality through their own actions and choices. Liberal feminists hope to eradicate all barriers to [[gender equality]], claiming that the continued existence of such barriers eviscerates the individual rights and freedoms ostensibly guaranteed by a liberal social order.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that society holds the false belief that women are by nature [[Gender inequality|less intellectually and physically capable]] than men; thus it tends to [[Sexism|discriminate against women]] in the [[Sexism in academia|academy]], the forum and the [[Occupational sexism|marketplace]]. Liberal feminists believe that "female subordination is rooted in a set of customary and legal constraints that blocks women's entrance to and success in the so-called public world". They strive for sexual equality via political and legal reform.&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosemarie 1989"&gt;Tong, Rosemarie. 1989. Feminist Thought: A Comprehensive Introduction. Oxon, United Kingdom: Unwin Human Ltd. Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

British [[List of women philosophers|philosopher]] [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759–1797) is widely regarded as the pioneer of liberal feminism, with ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) expanding the boundaries of liberalism to include women in the political structure of liberal society.&lt;ref&gt;Falco, pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; In her writings such as ''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'', Wollstonecraft commented on society's view of the woman and encouraged women to use their voices in making decisions separate from decisions previously made for them. Wollstonecraft "denied that women are, by nature, more pleasure seeking and pleasure giving than men. She reasoned that if they were confined to the same cages that trap women, men would develop the same flawed characters. What Wollstonecraft most wanted for women was personhood".&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosemarie 1989"/&gt;

[[John Stuart Mill]] was also an early proponent of feminism. In his article ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' (1861, published 1869), Mill attempted to prove that the legal subjugation of women is wrong and that it should give way to perfect equality.&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mill: critical assessments, Volume 4, By [[John Cunningham Wood]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mill, J.S. (1869) [http://www.constitution.org/jsm/women.htm ''The Subjection of Women''], Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that both sexes should have equal rights under the law and that "until conditions of equality exist, no one can possibly assess the natural differences between women and men, distorted as they have been. What is natural to the two sexes can only be found out by allowing both to develop and use their faculties freely".&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart (1869). The Subjection of Women (1869 first ed.). London: Longmans, Green, Reader &amp; Dyer. Retrieved 10 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Mill frequently spoke of this imbalance and wondered if women were able to feel the same "genuine unselfishness" that men did in providing for their families. This unselfishness Mill advocated is the one "that motivates people to take into account the good of society as well as the good of the individual person or small family unit".&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosemarie 1989"/&gt; Similar to Mary Wollstonecraft, Mill compared sexual inequality to slavery, arguing that their husbands are often just as abusive as masters and that a human being controls nearly every aspect of life for another human being. In his book ''The Subjection of Women'', Mill argues that three major parts of women's lives are hindering them: society and gender construction, education and marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill-moral-political/|title=Mill's Moral and Political Philosophy|last=Brink|first=David|date=9 October 2007|website=|publisher=Stanford University|access-date=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Equity feminism]] is a form of liberal feminism discussed since the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Social Feminism |first=Naomi |last=Black |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=kDYqAAAAYAAJ |year=1989 |publisher=Cornell University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Halfmann&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Q83kxhOsgxYC&amp;pg=PA79 |title=Industry and Politics in West Germany: Toward the Third Republic |editor-first=Peter J. |editor-last=Katzenstein |chapter=3.

=== Social liberal theory ===
{{main|Social liberalism}}
[[File:Jean Charles de Sismondi.png|thumb|upright|[[Sismondi]] in 1819 wrote the first critique of the free market from a liberal perspective]]
[[Jean Charles Léonard Simonde de Sismondi]]'s ''Nouveaux principes d'économie politique, ou de la richesse dans ses rapports avec la population'' (1819) represents the first comprehensive liberal critique of early capitalism and laissez-faire economics, and his writings, which were studied by [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Karl Marx]] among many others, had a profound influence on both liberal and socialist responses to the failures and contradictions of industrial society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stewart |first1=Ross E. |title=Sismondi's Forgotten Ethical Critique of Early Capitalism |journal=Journal of Business Ethics |date=1984 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=227–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spiegel |first1=Henry William |title=The Growth of Economic Thought |date=1991 |publisher=Duke University Press |pages=302–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gareth"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stedman Jones, Gareth |editor1-last=Aprile |editor1-first=Sylvie |editor2-last=Bensimon |editor2-first=Fabrice |title=La France et l'Angleterre au XIXe siècle.

The ideal of the [[Self-made man|self-made individual]], who through hard work and talent could make his or her place in the world, seemed increasingly implausible. A major political reaction against the changes introduced by [[industrialisation]] and ''laissez-faire'' capitalism came from conservatives concerned about social balance, although [[socialism]] later became a more important force for change and reform. Some [[Victorian literature|Victorian writers]], including [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Carlyle]] and [[Matthew Arnold]], became early influential critics of social injustice.&lt;ref name="Richardson, pp. 36–37"&gt;Richardson, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

New liberals began to adapt the old language of liberalism to confront these difficult circumstances, which they believed could only be resolved through a broader and more interventionist conception of the state. An equal right to liberty could not be established merely by ensuring that individuals did not physically interfere with each other, or merely by having laws that were impartially formulated and applied. More positive and proactive measures were required to ensure that every individual would have an [[equal opportunity]] of success.&lt;ref name='eatwell'&gt;{{cite book|last=Eatwell|first=Roger|author2=Wright, Anthony|title=Contemporary political ideologies|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=1999|isbn=9780826451736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PSM V03 D380 John Stuart Mill.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[On Liberty]]'' greatly influenced the course of 19th century liberalism]]
[[John Stuart Mill]] contributed enormously to liberal thought by combining elements of classical liberalism with what eventually became known as the new liberalism. Mill's 1859 ''[[On Liberty]]'' addressed the nature and limits of the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] that can be legitimately exercised by society over the [[individual]].&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart ''On Liberty'' Penguin Classics, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-14-144147-4}} pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; He gave an impassioned defence of free speech, arguing that free [[discourse]] is a [[necessary condition]] for intellectual and social progress. Mill defined "[[social liberty]]" as protection from "the tyranny of political rulers". He introduced a number of different concepts of the form tyranny can take, referred to as social tyranny and [[tyranny of the majority]], respectively. Social liberty meant limits on the ruler's power through obtaining recognition of political liberties or rights and by the establishment of a system of "[[constitutional]] checks".&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart ''On Liberty'' Penguin Classics, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-14-144147-4}} pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

His definition of liberty, influenced by [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[Josiah Warren]], was that the [[individual]] ought to be free to do as he wishes unless he harms others.&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mill (1806–1873), "The Contest in America". Harper's New Monthly Magazine. Volume 24. Issue 143. pp. 683–684. Harper &amp; Bros. New York. April 1862.

Another early liberal convert to greater government intervention was [[Thomas Hill Green]]. Seeing the effects of alcohol, he believed that the state should foster and protect the social, political and economic environments in which individuals will have the best chance of acting according to their consciences. The state should intervene only where there is a clear, proven and strong tendency of a liberty to enslave the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, P. P., "T. H. Green and State Action: Liquor Legislation", ''History of Political Thought'', 6 (1985), 517–50. Reprinted in A. Vincent, ed., ''The Philosophy of T. H. Green'' (Aldershot: Gower, 1986), pp. 76–103&lt;/ref&gt; Green regarded the national state as legitimate only to the extent that it upholds a system of rights and obligations that is most likely to foster individual self-realisation.

The New Liberalism or social liberalism movement emerged about 1900 in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Freeden]], ''The New Liberalism: An Ideology of Social Reform'' (Oxford UP, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; The New Liberals, which included intellectuals like L. T. Hobhouse and [[John A. Hobson]], saw individual liberty as something achievable only under favorable social and economic circumstances.&lt;ref name="adams"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|title=Political Ideology Today (Politics Today)|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|isbn=0719060206|year=2001|location=Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their view, the poverty, squalor and ignorance in which many people lived made it impossible for freedom and individuality to flourish. New Liberals believed that these conditions could be ameliorated only through collective action coordinated by a strong, welfare-oriented and interventionist state.&lt;ref&gt;The Routledge Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, p. 599&lt;/ref&gt; It supports a [[mixed economy]] that includes both [[public property|public]] and private property in [[capital good]]s.&lt;ref name="Stanislao G.

[[Classical liberalism]] advocates [[free trade]] under the rule of law.  [[Anarcho-capitalism]] goes one step further, with law enforcement and the courts being provided by private companies.  Various theorists have espoused legal philosophies similar to anarcho-capitalism. One of the first liberals to discuss the possibility of [[privatizing]] protection of individual liberty and property was France's [[Jakob Mauvillon]] in the 18th century. Later in the 1840s, [[Julius Faucher]] and [[Gustave de Molinari]] advocated the same. In his essay ''The Production of Security'', Molinari argued: "No government should have the right to prevent another government from going into competition with it, or to require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this commodity". Molinari and this new type of anti-state liberal grounded their reasoning on liberal ideals and classical economics. Historian and libertarian [[Ralph Raico]] argues that what these liberal philosophers "had come up with was a form of individualist anarchism, or, as it would be called today, anarcho-capitalism or market anarchism".&lt;ref&gt;Raico, Ralph (2004) [https://www.mises.org/story/1787 ''Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th century''] Ecole Polytechnique, [http://www.crea.polytechnique.fr/index.htm Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee], Unité associée au CNRS&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the liberalism of Locke, which saw the state as evolving from society, the anti-state liberals saw a fundamental conflict between the voluntary interactions of people, i.e. society; and the institutions of force, i.e. the state. This society versus state idea was expressed in various ways: natural society vs. artificial society, liberty vs. authority, society of contract vs. society of authority and industrial society vs. militant society, just to name a few.&lt;ref name="Molinari-1849"&gt;Molinari, Gustave de (1849) [http://praxeology.net/GM-PS.htm The Production of Security] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QjP50k9o?url=http://praxeology.net/GM-PS.htm |date=31 July 2007 }} (trans. J. Huston McCulloch). Retrieved 15 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-state liberal tradition in Europe and the United States continued after Molinari in the early writings of [[Herbert Spencer]] as well as in thinkers such as [[Paul Émile de Puydt]] and [[Auberon Herbert]]. However, the first person to use the term anarcho-capitalism was [[Murray Rothbard]], who in the mid-20th century synthesized elements from the [[Austrian School]] of economics, classical liberalism and 19th-century American [[individualist anarchist]]s [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Benjamin Tucker]] (while rejecting their [[labor theory of value]] and the norms they derived from it).&lt;ref&gt;"A student and disciple of the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, Rothbard combined the laissez-faire economics of his teacher with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state he had absorbed from studying the individualist American anarchists of the 19th century such as Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker." Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought, 1987, {{ISBN|978-0-631-17944-3}}, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favor of [[Self-ownership|individual sovereignty]], [[private property]] and [[free markets]]. Anarcho-capitalists believe that in the absence of [[statute]] (law by [[decree]] or [[legislation]]), society would improve itself through the discipline of the free market (or what its proponents describe as a "[[voluntary society]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Morris |first=Andrew |authorlink= |editor-first=Ronald |editor-last=Hamowy |editor-link=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC |year=2008 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]] |location= Thousand Oaks, CA |doi=10.4135/9781412965811.n8 |isbn= 978-1-4129-6580-4 |oclc=750831024| lccn = 2008009151 |pages=13–14 |quote= |ref= |chapter=Anarcho-Capitalism |title= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stringham51&gt;Edward Stringham, ''Anarchy and the law: the political economy of choice,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=nft4e62nicsC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=anarcho-capitalism+libertarian&amp;sa=X&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8#v=onepage&amp;q=anarcho-capitalism%20libertarian p. 51].&lt;/ref&gt;

In an anarcho-capitalist society, [[law enforcement]], [[court]]s and all other security services would be operated by privately funded competitors rather than centrally through [[taxation]]. [[Money]], along with all other [[goods and services]], would be [[free banking|privately and competitively provided]] in an [[open market]]. Therefore, personal and economic activities under anarcho-capitalism would be regulated by victim-based [[dispute resolution organizations]] under [[tort]] and [[contract]] law, rather than by statute through centrally determined punishment under political monopolies.&lt;ref name="libertarianpapers"&gt;[http://libertarianpapers.org/articles/2011/lp-3-3.pdf "Review of Kosanke's Instead of Politics – Don Stacy"] Libertarian Papers VOL. 3, ART.

[[File:John Locke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Locke]] was the first to develop a liberal philosophy, including the [[Right to property|right to private property]] and the [[consent of the governed]]]]
Isolated strands of liberal thought had existed in [[Western philosophy]] since the [[Ancient Greeks]] and in [[Eastern philosophy]] since the [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] period. These ideas were first drawn together and systematized as a distinct ideology, by the English philosopher [[John Locke]], generally regarded as the father of modern liberalism.&lt;ref name="Delaney, p. 18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Godwin et al., p. 12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FungCambridge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fung|first1=Edmund S.

These ideas began to coalesce at the time of the [[English Civil War]]s. The [[Levellers]], a radical political movement, during the war called for [[Freedom of religion in the United Kingdom|freedom of religion]], frequent convening of parliament and equality under the law. The impact of these ideas steadily increased during the [[Early modern Britain|17th century in England]], culminating in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which enshrined [[parliamentary sovereignty]] and the [[right of revolution]] and led to the establishment of what many consider the first modern, liberal state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oc-uXxPXfmwC|title=1688: The First Modern Revolution|author=Steven Pincus|year=2009|publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-15605-7 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of liberalism continued throughout the 18th century with the burgeoning Enlightenment ideals of the era. This was a period of profound intellectual vitality that questioned old traditions and influenced several [[Monarchies in Europe|European monarchies]] throughout the 18th century. Political tension between England and its [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] grew after 1765 and the [[Seven Years' War]] over the issue of [[No taxation without representation|taxation without representation]], culminating in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] of a new republic, and the resulting [[American Revolutionary War]] to defend it. After the war, the leaders debated about how to move forward. The [[Articles of Confederation]], written in 1776, now appeared inadequate to provide security, or even a functional government. The [[United States in Congress Assembled|Confederation Congress]] called a [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787, which resulted in the writing of a new [[Constitution of the United States]] establishing a [[Federation|federal]] government. In the context of the times, the Constitution was a republican and liberal document.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p. 701.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Milan Zafirovski|title=Liberal Modernity and Its Adversaries: Freedom, Liberalism and Anti-Liberalism in the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNlT9Qho0tAC|year=2007|publisher=Brill|pages=237–38|isbn=90-04-16052-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains the oldest liberal governing document in effect worldwide.

In Europe, liberalism has a long tradition dating back to the 17th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;German songs like ''[[Die Gedanken sind frei]]'' (''Thoughts Are Free'') can be dated even centuries before that.&lt;/ref&gt; The French Revolution began in 1789. The two key events that marked the triumph of liberalism were the [[abolition of feudalism in France]] on the night of 4 August 1789, which marked the collapse of feudal and old traditional rights and privileges and restrictions as well as the passage of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jon Meacham|title=Thomas Jefferson: President and Philosopher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tvBMBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT131|year=2014|publisher=Random House|page=131|isbn=9780385387514}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the French brought to Western Europe the liquidation of the [[Feudalism|feudal system]], the liberalization of [[property law]]s, the end of [[Manorialism|seigneurial dues]], the abolition of [[guild]]s, the legalization of [[divorce]], the disintegration of [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|Jewish ghettos]], the collapse of the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]], the final end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the elimination of church courts and religious authority, the establishment of the [[metric system]] and equality under the law for all men.&lt;ref&gt;Colton and Palmer, pp. 428–29.&lt;/ref&gt; His most lasting achievement, the [[Napoleonic code|Civil Code]], served as "an object of emulation all over the globe",&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; but it also perpetuated further discrimination against women under the banner of the "natural order".&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, pp. 98–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development into maturity of classical liberalism took place before and after the French Revolution in Britain.&lt;ref name="Vincent, pp. 29–30"/&gt; [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, was to provide most of the ideas of economics at least until the publication of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''Principles'' in 1848.&lt;ref name="Mills, pp. 63, 68"/&gt; Smith addressed the motivation for economic activity, the causes of prices and the distribution of wealth and the policies the state should follow in order to maximise wealth.&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 64"&gt;Mills, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The [[radicalism (historical)|radical liberal movement]] began in the 1790s in England and concentrated on parliamentary and electoral reform, emphasizing natural rights and [[popular sovereignty]]. Radicals like [[Richard Price]] and [[Joseph Priestley]] saw parliamentary reform as a first step toward dealing with their many grievances, including the treatment of [[English Dissenters|Protestant Dissenters]], the slave trade, high prices and high taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Liberalism and conservatism in Latin America|Latin America]], liberal unrest dates back to the 18th century, when liberal agitation in Latin America led to [[Latin American wars of independence|independence]] from the imperial power of Spain and Portugal. The new regimes were generally liberal in their political outlook and employed the philosophy of [[positivism]], which emphasized the truth of modern science, to buttress their positions.&lt;ref&gt;Arturo Ardao, "Assimilation and transformation of positivism in Latin America". ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1963): 515–522. [http://pics3441.upmf-grenoble.fr/articles/cult/assimilation_and_transformation_of_positivism_in_latin_america.pdf Online]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212190612/http://pics3441.upmf-grenoble.fr/articles/cult/assimilation_and_transformation_of_positivism_in_latin_america.pdf|date=12 February 2015}}; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2707981 also in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, a [[American Civil War|vicious war]] ensured the integrity of the nation and the abolition of slavery in the [[Southern United States|South]]. Historian Don Doyle has argued that the Union victory in the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865) gave a major boost to the course of liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Don H. Doyle, ''The Cause of All Nations: An International History of the American Civil War'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

During 19th and early 20th century in the Ottoman Empire and Middle East, liberalism influenced periods of reform such as the [[Tanzimat]] and [[Al-Nahda]]; the rise of secularism, constitutionalism and nationalism; and different intellectuals and religious group and movements, like the [[Young Ottomans]] and [[Islamic Modernism]]. Prominent of the era were [[Rifa'a al-Tahtawi]], [[Namık Kemal]] and [[İbrahim Şinasi]]. However, the reformist ideas and trends did not reach the common population successfully as the books, periodicals and newspapers were accessible primarily to intellectuals and segments of an emerging middle class while many [[Muslim]]s saw them as foreign influences on the [[Liberalism and progressivism in the Muslim world|world of Islam]]. That perception complicated reformist efforts made by Middle Eastern states.&lt;ref name="Abdelmoula"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abdelmoula|first1=Ezzeddine|title=Al Jazeera and Democratization: The Rise of the Arab Public Sphere|year=2015|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=1317518470|pages=50–52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vP7qBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roderic.

[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|The iconic painting ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]], a tableau of the [[July Revolution]] in 1830]]
[[Abolitionism|Abolitionist]] and [[suffrage]] movements spread, along with representative and democratic ideals. France established an [[French Third Republic|enduring republic]] in the 1870s. However, nationalism also spread rapidly after 1815. A mixture of liberal and nationalist sentiment in [[Liberalism and radicalism in Italy|Italy]] and Germany brought about the unification of the two countries in the late 19th century. A liberal regime came to power in Italy and ended the secular power of the Popes. However, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] launched a counter crusade against liberalism. [[Pope Pius IX]] issued the ''[[Syllabus of Errors]]'' in 1864, condemning liberalism in all its forms. In many countries, liberal forces responded by [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expelling the Jesuit order]]. By the end of the nineteenth century, the principles of classical liberalism were being increasingly challenged and the ideal of the self-made individual seemed increasingly implausible. Victorian writers like [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Carlyle]] and [[Matthew Arnold]] were early influential critics of social injustice.&lt;ref name="Richardson, pp. 36–37"/&gt;

Liberalism gained momentum in the beginning of the 20th century. The bastion of [[autocracy]], the [[Nicholas II|Russian Tsar]], was overthrown in the [[February Revolution|first phase]] of the [[Russian Revolution]]. The Allied victory in the [[First World War]] and the collapse of four empires seemed to mark the triumph of liberalism across the European continent, not just among the [[Allies of World War I|victorious allies]], but also in Germany and the newly created states of [[Eastern Europe]]. Militarism, as typified by Germany, was defeated and discredited. As Blinkhorn argues, the liberal themes were ascendant in terms of "cultural pluralism, religious and ethnic toleration, national self-determination, free market economics, representative and responsible government, free trade, unionism, and the peaceful settlement of international disputes through a new body, the [[League of Nations]]".

In the Middle East, liberalism led to constitutional periods, like the Ottoman [[First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|First]] and [[Second Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|Second Constitutional Era]] and the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution|Persian constitutional period]], but it declined in the late 1930s due the growth and opposition of [[Islamism]] and [[Pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] [[Arab nationalism|nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurzman|first1=Charles|title=Liberal Islam: A Source Book|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195116224|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4n8HSe9SfXMC&amp;pg=PA10|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moaddel1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moaddel|first1=Mansoor|title=Islamic Modernism, Nationalism, and Fundamentalism: Episode and Discourse|year=2005|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226533336|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dk6BLopmn3gC&amp;pg=PA4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lapidus"&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Islamic Societies |last=Lapidus |first=Ira Marvin |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=0521779332 |page=496 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3mVUEzm8xMC&amp;pg=PA496}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LorentzIran"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lorentz|first1=John H.|title=The A to Z of Iran|year=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=1461731917|page=224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oV9WwxXbCB8C&amp;pg=PA224|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LindgrenRoss"/&gt; However, there were various examples of intellectuals who advocated liberal values and ideas.

In the United States, [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberalism]] traces its history to the popular presidency of [[Franklin D.

Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Alterman, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the definitive liberal response to the Great Depression was given by the British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], who had begun a theoretical work examining the relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pressman|first=Steven|title=Fifty Great Economists|year=1999|isbn=0-415-13481-1|pages=96–100|publisher=London: routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worldwide Great Depression, starting in 1929, hastened the discrediting of liberal economics and strengthened calls for state control over economic affairs. Economic woes prompted widespread unrest in the European political world, leading to the rise of [[fascism]] as an ideology and a movement arrayed against both liberalism and [[communism]], especially in [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Heywood, pp. 218–26.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of fascism in the 1930s eventually culminated in [[World War II]], the deadliest conflict in human history. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] prevailed in the war by 1945 and their victory set the stage for the [[Cold War]] between the [[Communist state|Communist]] [[Eastern Bloc]] and the liberal [[Western Bloc]].

[[Liberalism in Iran|In Iran]], liberalism enjoyed wide popularity. In April 1951, the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]] became the governing coalition when democratically elected [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]], a liberal nationalist, took office as the [[Prime Minister of Iran|Prime Minister]]. However, his way of governing entered in conflict with Western interest and he was removed from power in a [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|coup on 19 August 1953]].

Among the various regional and national movements, the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States during the 1960s strongly highlighted the liberal efforts for [[Social equality|equal rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie and Weisbrot, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Society]] project launched by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B.

[[File:Nizhny Novgorod. Anti-Corruption Rally (26 March 2017).jpg|thumb|[[2017 Russian protests]], organized by Russia's liberal opposition]]
The Cold War featured extensive ideological competition and several [[proxy war]]s, but the widely feared [[World War III]] between the Soviet Union and the United States never occurred. While communist states and liberal democracies competed against one another, an [[1973 oil crisis|economic crisis]] in the 1970s inspired a move away from [[Keynesian economics]], especially under [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the United Kingdom and [[Ronald Reagan]] in the United States. This trend, called "[[neoliberalism]]" by its opponents, lasted through the 1980s and the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Meanwhile, nearing the end of the 20th century communist states in Eastern Europe [[Revolutions of 1989|collapsed precipitously]], leaving liberal democracies as the only major forms of government in the West.

At the beginning of World War II, the number of democracies around the world was about the same as it had been forty years before.&lt;ref&gt;Colomer, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1945, liberal democracies spread very quickly, but then retreated. In ''The Spirit of Democracy'', Larry Diamond argues that by 1974 "dictatorship, not democracy, was the way of the world" and that "barely a quarter of independent states chose their governments through competitive, free, and fair elections". Diamond goes on to say that democracy bounced back and by 1995 the world was "predominantly democratic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Larry Diamond|title=The Spirit of Democracy: The Struggle to Build Free Societies Throughout the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vx3JTGSB5JcC&amp;pg=PA7|year=2008|publisher=Henry Holt|page=7|isbn=978-0-8050-7869-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom in the World 2016|publisher=Freedom House|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2016?gclid=COLduYD4ys4CFVUvgQodDPkNvw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberalism has drawn both criticism and support in its history from various ideological groups. Less friendly to the goals of liberalism has been [[conservatism]]. [[Edmund Burke]], considered by some to be the first major proponent of modern conservative thought, offered a blistering critique of the French Revolution by assailing the liberal pretensions to the power of rationality and to the natural equality of all humans.&lt;ref name="Grigsby, p. 108"&gt;Grigsby, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some confusion remains about the relationship between social liberalism and [[socialism]], despite the fact that many variants of socialism distinguish themselves markedly from liberalism by [[anti-capitalism|opposing capitalism]], [[hierarchy]] and [[private property]]. Socialism formed as a group of related yet divergent ideologies in the 19th century such as [[Christian socialism]], [[communism]] (with the writings of [[Karl Marx]]) and [[social anarchism]] (with the writings of [[Mikhail Bakunin]]), the latter two influenced by the [[Paris Commune]]. These ideologies—as with liberalism and conservatism—fractured into several major and minor movements in the following decades.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, pp. 119–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx rejected the foundational aspects of liberal theory, hoping to destroy both the state and the liberal distinction between society and the individual while fusing the two into a collective whole designed to overthrow the developing capitalist order of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Koerner, pp. 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, socialist parties and ideas remain a political force with varying degrees of power and influence on all continents leading national governments in many countries.

[[Vladimir Lenin]] stated that—in contrast with [[Marxism]]—liberal science defends [[wage slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Selsam|first1=Howard|last2=Martel|first2=Harry|authorlink1=Howard Selsam|title=Reader in Marxist Philosophy|year=1963|publisher=[[International Publishers]]|isbn=0717801675|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CsoSQ6vD8fUC&amp;pg=PA37|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lenin|first1=Vladimir|authorlink1=Vladimir Lenin|title=On Culture and Cultural Revolution|date=2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CsoSQ6vD8fUC&amp;pg=PA37|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|isbn=1434463524|page=34|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some proponents of liberalism like [[George Henry Evans]], [[Silvio Gesell]] and [[Thomas Paine]] were critics of wage slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/history/paine4.html Social Security Online History Pages]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Junius P.|authorlink1=Junius P.

In the same vein, conservatives have also attacked what they perceive to be the reckless liberal pursuit of progress and material gains, arguing that such preoccupations undermine traditional social values rooted in community and continuity.&lt;ref&gt;Koerner, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few variations of conservatism, like [[liberal conservativism]], expound some of the same ideas and principles championed by classical liberalism, including "small government and thriving capitalism".&lt;ref name="Grigsby, p. 108"/&gt;

[[Social democracy]], an ideology advocating progressive modification of [[capitalism]], emerged in the 20th century and was influenced by socialism. Broadly defined as a project that aims to correct through government reformism what it regards as the intrinsic defects of capitalism by reducing inequalities,&lt;ref&gt;Lightfoot, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; social democracy was also not against the state. Several commentators have noted strong similarities between social liberalism and social democracy, with one political scientist even calling American liberalism "bootleg social democracy" due to the absence of a significant social democratic tradition in the United States that liberals have tried to rectify.&lt;ref&gt;Susser, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Another movement associated with modern democracy, [[Christian democracy]], hopes to spread [[Catholic social teaching|Catholic social ideas]] and has gained a large following in some European nations.&lt;ref&gt;Riff, pp. 34–36.&lt;/ref&gt; The early roots of Christian democracy developed as a reaction against the [[industrialisation]] and [[urbanisation]] associated with ''laissez-faire'' liberalism in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Riff, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these complex relationships, some scholars have argued that liberalism actually "rejects ideological thinking" altogether, largely because such thinking could lead to unrealistic expectations for human society.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fascism and ideology#Liberalism|Fascists accuse liberalism]] of materialism and a lack of spiritual values.&lt;ref name="massaschussetts1"&gt;Marvin Perry, Myrna Chase, Margaret Jacob, James R. Jacob. ''Western Civilization: Ideas, Politics, and Society – From 1600, Volume 2''. 9th ed. Boston, Massaschussetts: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company, 2009 pp. 760.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, fascism opposes liberalism for its [[materialism]], [[rationalism]], [[individualism]] and [[utilitarianism]].&lt;ref name="revolution1994"&gt;Sternhell, Zeev, Mario Sznajder and Maia Ashéri. ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'' (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1994) 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascists believe that the liberal emphasis on individual freedom produces national divisiveness,&lt;ref name="massaschussetts1"/&gt; but many fascists agree with liberals in their support of [[private property rights]] and a [[market economy]].&lt;ref name="revolution1994"/&gt;

Scholars have praised the influence of liberal internationalism, claiming that the rise of [[globalisation]] "constitutes a triumph of the liberal vision that first appeared in the eighteenth century" while also writing that liberalism is "the only comprehensive and hopeful vision of world affairs".&lt;ref&gt;Venturelli, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="775">In algebra, a '''locally compact field''' is a [[topological field]] whose topology forms a [[locally compact space]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Functional Analysis and Valuation Theory|first=Lawrence|last=Narici|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|year=1971|isbn=9780824714840|pages=21–22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dSGMFF3viGkC&amp;pg=PA21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (in particular, it is a Hausdorff space). Examples are discrete fields and [[local field]]s such as the field of complex numbers and the ''p''-adic fields. Since one can always give discrete topology to a field, any field can be turned into a locally compact field.

A '''video mashup''' (also written as '''video mash-up''') combines multiple pre-existing [[video]] sources with no discernible relation with each other into a unified video.  These are [[derivative work]]s as defined by the United States Copyright Act {{UnitedStatesCode|17|101}}, and as such, may find protection from [[copyright|copyright claims]] under the doctrine of [[fair use]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmsimpact.org/sites/default/files/online_best_practices_in_fair_use.pdf |format=PDF |title=Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Online Video |date=June 2008 |publisher=American University |website=Center for Media &amp; Social Impact}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of mashup videos include [[movie trailer]] [[remixes]], [[Vidding|vids]], [[YouTube Poop]], Wishfie Reaction Videos&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stuff.tv/in/hot-stuff/apps/send-group-greetings-all-your-pals-wishfie|title=Send group greetings to all your pals with Wishfie|work=Stuff|access-date=2017-09-16|language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[supercut]]s.&lt;ref name="EFF"&gt;{{cite web |title=In the matter of exemption to prohibition on circumvention of copyright protection systems for access control technologies |url=https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/2012_dmca_exemption_requests_Final_1.pdf |format=PDF |website=Electronic Frontier Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/08/04/tech-diary-video-mashups-a-new-kind-of-art/|title=Tech Diary: Video Mashups — a New Kind of Art|author=Andy Jordan|work=WSJ|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music videos ==
* The first type is a derivative music video, which is the most common one, by recombining two or more pre–existing materials together into a new one. These materials usually are prevailing music videos, but also includes separate songs, videos, and still images .&lt;ref name="ing.unibs.it"&gt;http://www.ing.unibs.it/~sbenini/pub/papers/CRB-11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to Navas, it can be a regressive type, for its promotional purpose.&lt;ref name="remixtheory.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://remixtheory.net/?p=444|title=Remix Theory  » Archivio   » Regressive and Reflexive Mashups in Sampling Culture, 2010 Revision,  by Eduardo Navas|publisher=|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The second type is slightly different from the first. It allows the users record their own track – either sung or played on an instrument – and then combine it with other tracks from internet together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/business/small-business/fl-saloote-music-startup-20141105-story.html|title=Saloote music video mashup app debuts from Fort Lauderdale - Sun Sentinel|author=South Florida Sun-Sentinel|date=5 November 2014|work=Sun-Sentinel.com|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

These two types of music video mashup are usually edited to match the rhythm of the song, and seeking to show a particular aesthetic style.And towards to a celebrative communication.&lt;ref name="ing.unibs.it"/&gt;

* The third one is a music video created from bits and pieces from various YouTube performances clipped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/5785106/you-must-watch-the-youtube-mashup-masters-triumphant-return|title=You Must Watch the YouTube Mashup Master's Triumphant Return|author=Brian Barrett|publisher=Gawker Media|work=Gizmodo|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now a widespread or traditional type, which stresses the participant feature of remix culture. According to the clarification of mashup by Navas, it could be the reflexive mashup, for it beyond the limitation of common music video, and eliminate the distance in geography and nationalities.&lt;ref name="remixtheory.net"/&gt;

The last two types are typical use-generated contents in the age of Web2.0,which reflects the more participation in mashup or remix culture.{{fact|date=August 2017}}

== Political videos ==
Political video mashups are a primary example of citizen-generated content. These mashups allow the creator to form new meanings by juxtaposing two pieces of original source material, for example, someone may take footage of a politician's speech and 'mash it up' with footage from a popular reality television show. This form of mashup, according to Richard L. Edwards and Chuck Tryon, can be accepted as allegories of citizen empowerment. According to their article 'Political Video Mashups as Allegories of Citizen Empowerment', the videos are empowering because the users become more literate with online and offline information they receive daily; they become more active when it comes to interpreting meaning and also realising how a speech may have been manipulated.&lt;ref name="journals.uic.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2617/2305|title=Political video mashups as allegories of citizen empowerment - Edwards - First Monday|publisher=|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online videos such as political mashups are starting to take on a serious role within the politics of the United States of America. In the 2008 elections (often referred to as the 'YouTube elections') more than 40% of voters watched video content relating to the elections online. Now that the internet is so widely accessible it enables the user to make and find digestible content; political mashup videos can make a serious speech more humorous, accessible and understandable. However, because anybody can create these mashups, it is important to remember that the original meaning could have been violated. Edwards and Tryon mention that parody has become the most important form of critical intertextuality.&lt;ref name="journals.uic.edu"/&gt; Often, the creator of a political mashup will completely flip the meaning in order to make it funny, some mashup artists choose to make an entirely manufactured meaning from source material. Notable examples of political mashup videos and artists can be found below.

== Trailers ==
Trailer mashups also known as recut trailers, involve collecting multiple pieces of film footage from one or multiple movies and editing them to create a new trailer. Trailer mashups are often created for a movie that does not exist or to change the genre of an existing film. Trailer mashups existence and popularity can be credited to convergence culture and the Web 2.0 infrastructure, allowing films to be easily accessed and shared online on video sharing websites such as YouTube.

Film has long been a read-only medium, it was only meant to be watched. With the expansion of YouTube and other video sharing websites over the years it has allowed film to be transformed into a read-write form of media. Digital files can now be accessed, edited and uploaded onto the internet. Free editing software is widely accessible so anyone with access to digital movie files can create a trailer mashup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mastersofmedia.hum.uva.nl/2012/09/13/mash-up-trailers-and-youtube-birth-of-a-new-media-object/|title=Mash-up trailers and YouTube: “birth” of a new media object|work=Masters of Media|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trailer mashups are not only a user generated form of digital creativity but a way to create anticipation for future releases, working in tandem with current movie trailers. Movie trailers are designed to give minimal plot detail and to create hype and anticipation. Fan made trailer mashups allow the audience to perform their own cinematic spin on current movie footage. This allows the trailer to focus on a specific actor or portion of the film. It could even change the plot or genre of the film entirely. The user generated trailer mashup allows for the creator disregard advertising and promotion paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/360/284|title=Fake and fan film trailers as incarnations of audience anticipation and desire - Williams - Transformative Works and Cultures|publisher=|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supercuts ==
The term [[supercut]] was first created by [[Andy Baio]]. Also known as supercut video mashups, they focus on the phrases and devices that are repeated in movies and TV and repeat them in a comic effect. The video content adds context to these clichés, and presents them in a new light, or inspire a moratorium on them.{{fact|date=August 2017}}

The supercut first appeared a year after YouTube was created. In 2006, an audience that would turn out to grow to more than six million watched CSI: Miami’s David Caruso don a pair of sunglasses after making a glib remark about a victim. In the video Caruso keeps doing that same action for seven minutes. The clip was perhaps the most prominent supercut before the term was even invented, and that was not by accident. It was because of the way the creator edited away to the screaming finale of the opening credits in between each iteration, establishing a jokey rhythm and a perennial callback. Details like these are key in the supercut genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcocreate.com/1682740/a-modern-genre-how-to-make-a-supercut|title=A Modern Genre: How To Make A Supercut|date=12 December 2013|work=Co.Create|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Web application videos ==
According to Eduardo Navas,&lt;ref&gt;Navas, E. (2010). Regressive and reflexive mashups in sampling culture. Mashup Cultures, 157-177.&lt;/ref&gt; web application mashups is a type of Regenerative Remix that developed with an interest to extend the functionality of software for specific purposes. Usually combinations of pre-existing sources brought together.The emergence of the web application mashups is for practical purposes. However, Navas recognizes that the reflexive mashups also can be used for entertainment and the most typical example is [[Vine (service)|Vine]].{{fact|date=August 2017}}

Vine is the most used video app in the market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore |first=Robert |url= https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/06/771378/ |title=TechCrunch – Vine Takes Early Command In The Mobile Video Market Over Viddy, Socialcam And Others Despite Low Adoption |publisher= techcrunch.com |date=March 6, 2013 |accessdate=April 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which for creating 6-second looping videos, prioritizes the visual. To better understand the creative capabilities of Vine’s limitations, we analyze its formal elements. The interface centers on a timeline: the video recording begins as the user touches the screen of their mobile device, and the recording takes place only so long as they’re touching the screen. Given this touch-and-hold interface, there’s no post-production editing: edits can be made by letting go of the touch before the end of the six seconds, framing a new shot, and then touching again to capture the next image in the montage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/imr/2013/11/05/rhythm-aesthetics-vine-contemporary-mobile-moving-image-production-practices|title=Rhythm Aesthetics: Vine &amp; contemporary mobile moving image production practices|publisher=|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to montages==
*For [[Sergei Eisenstein]],&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein, S. (1949) ‘A Dialectic Approach to Film Form’ in Film Form. New York: HBJ Books, pp. 45-64.&lt;/ref&gt; 'montage is an idea that arises from the collision of independent shots-shots even opposite to one another to form the "dramatic" principle and means of unrolling an idea with the help of single shots: the "epic" principle'.
*Eisenstein managed to compress time and space of videos through his skills at editing and it influences the basic principles of video mashup.
*[[Soviet montage theory|Montage]] creates conflict of art by:
**'''[[Being]]''': It is an everlasting form of friction between ''two contradictory opposites''.
**'''[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|Synthesis]]''': It comes to be from the opposition between thesis and antithesis (is used in writing or speech when two opposites are introduced for ''contrasting effect'').
*[[Conflict (process)|Conflict]] in art is divided by:
# '''Social Mission''': To make ‘real’ the contradictions of '''Being''' and help form intellectual concepts.
# '''[[Nature]]''': Natural existence Vs creative tendency. Application the principals of rational logic to art.
# '''[[Methodology]]''': The collision of organic form Vs. the logical of rational form creates the dialect of the art- form.
*'''Visual counterpoints''' in the moving image (cinema)
# '''Spatial counterpoint''' of graphic art
# '''Temporal counterpoint''' of music
A precedent for video mashups can be discovered in the montage films of Eisenstein.

==Notable examples==
'''[[Hillary 1984]]''' - In March 2007 ''Hillary 1984'', a mashup of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[1984 (advertisement)|''1984'' launch commercial]] for the [[Macintosh]] with footage of [[Hillary Clinton]] used in the place of [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]], [[Viral video|went viral]] in the early stages of the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008|race for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination]]. The video was produced in support of [[Barack Obama]] by Phil de Vellis, an employee of [[Blue State Digital]], but was made without the knowledge of either [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|Obama's campaign]], or his employer: de Vellis stated that he made the video in one afternoon at home using a Mac and some software. Political commentators including [[Carla Marinucci]] and [[Arianna Huffington]], as well as de Vellis himself, suggested that the video demonstrated the way technology had created new opportunities for individuals to make an impact on politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Political-video-smackdown-Hillary-1984-2609651.php |title=Political video smackdown / 'Hillary 1984': Unauthorized Internet ad for Obama converts Apple Computer's '84 Super Bowl spot into a generational howl against Clinton's presidential bid |last=Marinucci |first=Carla|author-link=Carla Marinucci|date=18 March 2007 |website=[[SFgate.com]] |access-date=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/who-created-hillary-1984-_b_43978.html?guccounter=1|title=Who Created “Hillary 1984”?

'''[[Cassetteboy]]''' - Their videos mainly focus on comedy, but many have a political message within them. For example, ''Cameron’s Conference Rap'' (which uses clips of David Cameron set to the beat of [[Eminem]]’s ''Lose Yourself''), ''Cassetteboy vs Nick Griffin vs Question Time'' and ''Cassetteboy vs The News''. However, not all have such a strong political emphasis. 
In an interview, Mike (one of the two people behind the channel) talks about how mash-up is an accessible practice, saying “It’s not an easy thing to do, but you don’t need very much to do it. You don’t need a camera or a microphone. You just need some footage and these days we’re drowning in digital content.”&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/oct/10/cassetteboy-david-cameron-mashup-copyright|title=Cassetteboy: 'David Cameron won't be pleased by our video'|author=Frances Perraudin|work=the Guardian|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[YouTube Rewind]]''' - YouTube Rewind is a yearly video series produced and released by YouTube, starting in 2010. It is a mash-up of various videos that went viral on the website in the previous year. The series started by simply placing clips of the videos next to one another in a countdown style, but then changed to a mash-up of both video and music, using YouTube stars to reference the videos. It does not have a political or informative stance, but rather one that is celebratory of the website and the people who are active on it.

'''What’s the Mashup?''' - What’s the Mashup? is a YouTube channel which began in 2014, with 100+ mashup videos as of 2018&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5wpkffQSa3_jZqCGQagypg&lt;/ref&gt;. France-based channel mashes videos for comedic effect, often taking dialogue from one film or television show, and dubbing that dialogue over chronological footage from another film or television show.&lt;ref&gt;http://media.wix.com/ugd/66a20d_09ba05f6de1a4ee5a34a17644557f93b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cinema Cereal''' - Cinema Cereal is a YouTube channel which began in 2011, with 250+ mashup videos as of 2018&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/user/CloudyEdenProduction&lt;/ref&gt;. American-based channel mashes videos for either comedic or dramatic effect, often cutting (or "spooning") two different scenes from two different films, and converging them into one continuous narrative scene.

== Copyright issues==
Mashup videos are increasingly popular online. When the mashup creators remix two or more videos or music from various sources e.g. TV, film, music etc., they may not be aware of the copyright of the original source. Without the permission of copyright owner, mashup video artists may violate the copyright law and charged by criminal copyright infringement. If they violate the law, their videos will be forced to take down on YouTube. YouTube can ban their accounts and they are forbidden to post anything online. In a more serious case, the copyright owners reserve their rights to sue the mashup artists and they may have a maximum punishment of five years in jail and large fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/186753/article.html|title=Mashup Artist Calls for Changes in Copyright Law|date=12 January 2010|work=PCWorld|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an obstacle that hinders mashup artists to develop mashup video more. The original copyright law is written in 1980s or even earlier and it did not include the possibilities of copyright infringement exist in digital era. Therefore, mashup artists and public suggests a reform of copyright law regarding on remix culture and mashup videos in order to give more freedom for mashup artists to create their work.

===United States===
In the United States, the Copyright Act of 1976 acts as the basis of copyright law to protect the rights of the original creators. It protects the original works of authorship. To some extent, it allows artists to reproduce the work and create derivative works of the original work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102|title=17 U.S. Code § 102 - Subject matter of copyright: In general|work=LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fair use is a limitation and exception to the copyright law. According to the ''[[Hofstra Law Review]]'', “If mashup artists could prove that they use others’ songs or clips to criticize, comment, or teach, then mashup artists might be able to use the copyrighted material without authorization." &lt;ref&gt;http://law.hofstra.edu/pdf/academics/journals/lawreview/lrv_issues_v39n02_cc-2-harper-final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Courts in the United States balance four factors when considering fair use:

# Purpose and character of the use (including: commercial nature, non-profit education purposes)
# Nature of the copyrighted work
# Amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole
# Effect of the use upon the potential market or value of the copyrighted work

In 2012, video mashup artist [[Jonathan McIntosh]] spoke before the [[United States Copyright Office]] to advocate for exemptions to the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kravets|first1=David|title=FEDS CONSIDERING ALLOWING DVD-ENCRYPTION CRACKING|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/05/dvd-encryption-hacking|accessdate=6 July 2017|publisher=Wired|date=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act#Previous_exemptions | final rulemaking]] stated an exemption for: "Motion pictures (including television shows and videos), as defined in 17 U.S.C. 101, where circumvention is undertaken solely in order to make use of short portions of the motion pictures for the purpose of criticism or comment in limited instances."

===United Kingdom===
Starting from Wednesday 1 October 2014, the new EU law becomes effective in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/parody-mashup-videos-made-legal-under-new-law-9763600.html|title=Parody videos made legal under new law|author=Kashmira Gander|date=29 September 2014|work=The Independent|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an amendment to the Copyright, Design and Patents Act 1988. It is now legal for people to use “limited amount” of copyrighted material in online video for the purposes of “parody, caricature or pastiche” without the consent of the copyright holder, only if their work do not convey a discriminatory message, or compete with the original. A judge will decide whether the video is funny enough to classify as a parody and if it violates the law.

Although the mashup video is now legal in practice, it does not affect YouTube’s terms of service. The most famous example in Britain is the Cassetteboy. Cassetteboy’s videos can be shown on TV channels now but sometimes YouTube can take down their videos if they violate the copyright of the music or clips in their videos.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

At the end of 1981, by invitation of the French Government Meena represented the Afghan resistance movement at the [[French Socialist Party]] Congress. The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] delegation at the Congress, headed by [[Boris Ponamaryev]], left the hall as participants cheered when Meena started waving a victory sign.&lt;ref name="rawa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawa.org/meena.html|title=Biography of Martyred Meena, RAWA's founding leader|publisher=RAWA |accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary inline|date=November 2015}}

== Personal life ==
Kamal was married to [[Afghanistan Liberation Organization]] leader [[Faiz Ahmad]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Brodsky, Anne E.]] ''With all our strength : the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan''. [[New York City]]: [[Routledge]], 2003. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; who was murdered by agents of [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] on November 12, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110710160918/http://web.e-ariana.com/ariana/eariana.nsf/allDocs/AC9DD311C800E73C87256CCF005E323F?OpenDocument Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, CIA Op and Homicidal Thug]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womeninwar.org/CMann_afghanwomanhood.pdf Models and Realities of Afghan Womanhood: A Retrospective and Prospects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313114943/http://www.womeninwar.org/CMann_afghanwomanhood.pdf |date=2012-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They had three children, whose whereabouts are unknown.

==Assassination==
Kamal was [[Assassination|assassinated]] in [[Quetta]], [[Pakistan]] on February 4, 1987. Reports vary as to who the assassins were, but are believed to have been agents of the Afghan Intelligence Service [[KHAD]], the Afghan [[secret police]], or of fundamentalist [[Mujahideen]] leader [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]].&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1973184.stm|title=BBC News - SOUTH ASIA - Afghan activist's killers hanged|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
In a special issue of the [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] on November 13, 2006, included Meena among "60 Asian Heroes" and wrote that "Although she was only 30 when she died, Meena had already planted the seeds of an Afghan women's rights movement based on the power of knowledge." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/asia/2006/heroes/in_meena.html TIME Magazine | 60 Years of Asian Heroes: Meena] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112202432/http://www.time.com/time/asia/2006/heroes/in_meena.html |date=January 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RAWA says of her "Meena gave 12 years of her short but brilliant life to struggle for her homeland and her people. She had a strong belief that despite the darkness of illiteracy, ignorance of fundamentalism, and corruption and decadence of sell outs imposed on our women under the name of freedom and equality, finally that half of population will be awaken and cross the path towards freedom, democracy and women's rights. The enemy was rightly shivering with fear by the love and respect that Meena was creating within the hearts of our people. They knew that within the fire of her fights all the enemies of freedom, democracy and women would be turned to ashes."&lt;ref name="rawa.org"/&gt;{{Primary inline|date=November 2015}}

An enduring quote from Meena states:&lt;ref name="Gioseffi2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Orr2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tamra Orr|title=We Visit Afghanistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLyXBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36|date=15 September 2011|publisher=Mitchell Lane Publishers, Incorporated|isbn=978-1-61228-102-5|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meta''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]]&lt;!--[[preposition]] and [[prefix]]--&gt; ''[[wikt:meta-|meta-]]'' μετά- meaning "after" or "beyond") is a prefix used in [[English language|English]] to indicate a concept which is an [[abstraction]] behind another concept, used to complete or add to the latter.

==Original Greek meaning==
In [[Greek (language)|Greek]], the prefix ''meta-'' is generally less esoteric than in [[English (language)|English]]; Greek ''meta-'' is equivalent to the [[Latin language|Latin]] words ''post-'' or ''ad-''. The use of the prefix in this sense occurs occasionally in [[English language|scientific English]] terms derived from [[Greek (language)|Greek]]. For example: the term ''[[Metatheria]]'' (the name for the [[clade]] of [[marsupial]] [[mammals]]) uses the prefix ''meta-'' in the sense the ''[[Metatheria]]'' occur on the tree of life adjacent to the ''[[Theria]]'' (the [[placental mammals]]).

==Epistemology==
{{anchor|About}}
In [[epistemology]], and often in common use, the prefix ''meta-'' is used to mean ''about (its own category)''. For example, [[metadata]] are data about data (who has produced them, when, what format the data are in and so on). In a database, [[metadata]] are also data about data stored in a data dictionary and describe information (data) about database tables such as the table name, table owner, details about columns, – essentially describing the table.   Also, [[metamemory]] in psychology means an individual's [[knowledge]] about whether or not they would remember something if they concentrated on recalling it. The modern sense of "an X about X" has given rise to concepts like "[[meta-cognition]]" (i.e. cognition about cognition), "[[meta-emotion]]" (i.e. emotion about emotion), "[[meta-discussion]]" (i.e. discussion about discussion), "[[meta-joke]]" (i.e. joke about jokes), and "[[metaprogramming]]" (i.e. writing programs that manipulate programs).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In a [[rule-based system]], a [[wiktionary:metarule|metarule]] is a rule governing the application of other rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/158976.158989 |title=The Use of Meta-rules in Rule Based Legal Computer Systems|first1=Uri J.|last1=Schild |first2=Shai|last2=Herzog |work=Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law |series=ICAIL '93|date=1993|location=Amsterdam, The Netherlands|pages=100–109|doi=10.1145/158976.158989|publisher = [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On higher level of abstraction==
Any subject can be said to have a ''[[metatheory]]'', a theoretical consideration of its properties, such as its [[wikt:foundation|foundation]]s, [[wikt:method|method]]s, [[wikt:form|form]] and [[utility]], on a higher level of abstraction. In linguistics, a grammar is considered as being expressed in a [[metalanguage]], language operating on a higher level to describe properties of the plain language (and not itself).

==Etymology==
The prefix comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[preposition]] and [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] ''meta-'' (μετά-), from μετά,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmeta%2F μητά], 
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; which meant "after", "beside", "with", "among" (with respect to the preposition, some of these meanings were distinguished by [[case marking]]). Other meanings include "beyond", "adjacent" and "self", and it is also used in the form μητα- as a prefix in Greek, with variants μετ- before vowels and μεθ- "meth-" before [[aspirated vowel]]s.

The earliest form of the word "meta" is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] ''me-ta'', written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&amp;wid=417|work=Palaeolexicon.com|title=The Linear B word me-ta}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek preposition is [[cognate]] with the Old English preposition [[wikt:mid#Etymology 1|''mid'']] "with", still found as a prefix in ''midwife''. Its use in English is the result of [[back-formation]] from the word "metaphysics". In origin ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' was just the title of one of the principal works of [[Aristotle]]; it was so named (by [[Andronicus of Rhodes]]) because in the customary ordering of the works of Aristotle it was the book following ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]''; it thus meant nothing more than "[the book that comes] after [the book entitled] ''Physics''". However, even Latin writers misinterpreted this as entailing metaphysics constituted "the science of what is beyond the physical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=metaphysics|title=Metaphysics|work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Aristotle's ''Metaphysics'' enunciates considerations of natures above physical realities, which one can examine through this particular part of philosophy, e.g., the existence of God. The use of the prefix was later extended to other contexts based on the understanding of metaphysics to mean "the science of what is beyond the physical".

==Quine and Hofstadter==

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cites uses of the meta- prefix as "beyond, about" (such as meta-economics and meta-philosophy) going back to 1917. However, these formations are parallel to the original "metaphysics" and "metaphysical", that is, as a prefix to general nouns (fields of study) or adjectives. Going by the ''OED'' citations, it began being used with specific nouns in connection with mathematical logic sometime before 1929. (In 1920 [[David Hilbert]] proposed a research project in what was called "[[metamathematics]].")

A notable early citation is [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s 1937 use of the word "metatheorem",&lt;ref&gt;Willard Van Orman Quine, "Logic Based on Inclusion and Abstraction", The ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'', Vol. 2, No. 4, pp.&amp;nbsp;145–152, December 1937&lt;/ref&gt; where meta- has the modern meaning of "an X about X". (Note earlier uses of "meta-economics" and even "metaphysics" do not have this doubled conceptual structure – they are about or beyond X but they do not themselves constitute an X).

[[Douglas Hofstadter]], in his 1979 book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' (and in the sequel, ''[[Metamagical Themas]]''), popularized this meaning of the term. The book, which deals with  [[self-reference]] and [[strange loop]]s, and touches on Quine and his work, was influential in many computer-related subcultures and may be responsible for the popularity of the prefix, for its use as a solo term, and for the many recent coinages which use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Meta-Musings|last=Cohen|first=Noam|date=Sep 5, 1988|work=The New Republic|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hofstadter uses meta as a stand-alone word, as an adjective and as a directional preposition ("going meta," a term he coins for the old rhetorical trick of taking a debate or analysis to another level of abstraction, as when somebody says "This debate isn't going anywhere"). This book may also be responsible for the association of "meta" with strange loops, as opposed to just abstraction.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The sentence "This sentence contains thirty-six letters," and the sentence which embeds it, are examples of "metasentences" referencing themselves in this way.

'''Mobbing''', as a sociological term, means [[bullying]] of an individual by a group, in any context, such as a [[family]], [[peer group]], [[school]], [[workplace]], [[neighborhood]], [[community]], or online.

When it occurs as [[emotion]]al [[abuse]] in the workplace, such as ‘ganging up’ by co-workers, [[Hierarchy|subordinate]]s or [[Superior (hierarchy)|superior]]s, to force someone out of the workplace through [[rumor]], [[innuendo]], [[intimidation]], [[humiliation]], [[discrediting]], and [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolation]], it is also referred to as malicious, nonsexual, nonracial / racial, general [[harassment]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mobbing: Emotional Abuse in the American Workplace'' by Noa Davenport, Ruth D. Schwartz and Gail Pursell Elliott.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of the concept ==
[[Konrad Lorenz]], in his book entitled ''[[On Aggression]]'' (1966), first described mobbing among birds and animals, attributing it to instincts rooted in the [[Darwinian]] struggle to thrive (see [[animal mobbing behavior]]). In his view, most humans are subject to similar innate impulses but capable of bringing them under rational control.&lt;ref name="Westhues"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.uwaterloo.ca/~kwesthue/mobbing.htm|title=Workplace Mobbing in Academe|website=arts.uwaterloo.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenz's explanation for his choice of the English word Mobbing was omitted in the English translation by Marjorie Kerr Wilson. According to [[Kenneth Westhues]], Lorenz chose the word mobbing because he remembered in the collective attack by birds, the old German term ''hassen auf'', which means "to hate after" or "to put a hate on" was applied and this emphasised "the depth of antipathy with which the attack is made" rather than the English word mobbing which emphasised the collective aspect of the attack.&lt;ref&gt; Westhues, Kenneth.(2007) [http://www.kwesthues.com/graz0701.htm Mobbing a Natural Fact], Adapted and revised from "Mobbing am akademischen Arbeitsplatz," a lecture given in the Society for Sociology at the University of Graz, Austria, on 23 January 2007, Retrieved on 17 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1970s, the Swedish physician {{Interlanguage link multi|Peter-Paul Heinemann|sv|3=Peter-Paul Heinemann|vertical-align=sup}} applied Lorenz's conceptualization to the collective aggression of children against a targeted child.&lt;ref name="Westhues" /&gt;

In the 1980s, professor and practising psychologist [[Heinz Leymann]] applied the term to ganging up in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Westhues" /&gt; 

In 2011, anthropologist Janice Harper published an essay in [[The Huffington Post]] suggesting that some of the anti-bully approaches effectively constitute a form of mobbing by using the label "bully" to dehumanize, encouraging people to shun and avoid people labeled bullies, and in some cases, sabotage their work or refuse to work with them, while almost always calling for their exclusion and termination from employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/janice-harper/the-bully-label-has-to-go_b_1068456.html|title=The Bully Label Has to Go|first=Janice|last=Harper|date=1 November 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cause ==
Janice Harper followed her Huffington Post essay with a series of essays in both The Huffington Post&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/janice-harper|title=Janice Harper - HuffPost|website=www.huffingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in her column, Beyond Bullying: Peacebuilding at Work, School and Home in Psychology Today&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beyond-bullying|title=Beyond Bullying|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; that argued that mobbing is a form of group aggression innate to primates, and that those who engage in mobbing are not necessarily "evil" or "psychopathic," but responding in a predictable and patterned manner when someone in a position of leadership or influence communicates to the group that someone must go. For that reason, she indicated that anyone can and will engage in mobbing, and that once mobbing gets underway, just as in the animal kingdom it will almost always continue and intensify as long as the target remains with the group. She subsequently published a book on the topic&lt;ref name="amazon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Mobbed-What-When-They-Really/dp/0692693335/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=|title=Mobbed!: What to Do When They Really Are Out to Get You|first=Janice Harper|last=Ph.D|date=24 August 2013|publisher=Backdoor Press|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she explored animal behavior, organizational cultures and historical forms of group aggression, suggesting that mobbing is a form of group aggression on a continuum of structural violence with genocide as the most extreme form of mob aggression.

== In the workplace ==
{{main article|Workplace bullying}}
British anti-bullying researchers [[Andrea Adams]] and [[Tim Field]] have used the expression "workplace bullying" instead of what Leymann called "mobbing" in a workplace context. They identify mobbing as a particular type of bullying that is not as apparent as most, defining it as "an emotional assault. It begins when an individual becomes the target of disrespectful and harmful behavior. Through [[innuendo]], rumors, and public discrediting, a hostile environment is created in which one individual gathers others to willingly, or unwillingly, participate in continuous malevolent actions to force a person out of the workplace."&lt;ref name="amwork"&gt;Davenport NZ, Schwartz RD &amp; Elliott GP [http://www.mobbing-usa.com Mobbing, Emotional Abuse in the American Workplace], 3rd Edition 2005, Civil Society Publishing. Ames, IA,&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams and Field believe that mobbing is typically found in work environments that have poorly organised production or working methods and incapable or inattentive management and that mobbing victims are usually "exceptional individuals who demonstrated intelligence, competence, creativity, integrity, accomplishment and dedication".&lt;ref name="amwork" /&gt;

In contrast, Janice Harper&lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt; suggests that workplace mobbing is typically found in organizations where there is limited opportunity for employees to exit, whether through tenure systems or contracts that make it difficult to terminate an employee (such as universities or unionized organizations), and/or where finding comparable work in the same community makes it difficult for the employee to voluntarily leave (such as academic positions, religious institutions, or military). In these employments, efforts to eliminate the worker will intensify to push the worker out against his or her will through shunning, sabotage, false accusations and a series of investigations and poor reviews. Another form of employment where workers are mobbed are those that require the use of uniforms or other markers of group inclusion (law enforcement, fire fighting, military), organizations where a single gender has predominated, but the other gender is beginning to enter (STEM fields, fire fighting, military, nursing, teaching, and construction). Finally, she suggests that organizations where there are limited opportunities for advancement can be prone to mobbing because those who do advance are more likely to view challenges to their leadership as threats to their precarious positions. Harper further challenges the idea that workers are targeted for their exceptional competence. In some cases, she suggests, exceptional workers are mobbed because they are viewed as threatening to someone, but some workers who are mobbed are not necessarily good workers. Rather, Harper contends, some mobbing targets are outcasts or unproductive workers who cannot easily be terminated, and are thus treated inhumanely to push them out. While Harper emphasizes the cruelty and damaging consequences of mobbing, her organizational analysis focuses on the structural, rather than moral, nature of the organization. Moreover, she views the behavior itself, which she terms workplace aggression, as grounded in group psychology, rather than individual psychosis—even when the mobbing is initiated due to a leader's personal psychosis, the dynamics of group aggression will transform the leader's bullying into group mobbing—two vastly distinct psychological and social phenomena.

Shallcross, Ramsay and Barker consider workplace "mobbing" to be a generally unfamiliar term in some English speaking countries. Some researchers claim that mobbing is simply another name for bullying. Workplace mobbing can be considered as a "virus" or a "cancer" that spreads throughout the workplace via [[gossip]], [[rumour]] and [[unfounded accusations]]. It is a deliberate attempt to force a person out of their workplace by [[humiliation]], general [[harassment]], [[emotional abuse]] and/or [[terrorism|terror]]. Mobbing can be described as being "ganged up on." Mobbing is executed by a leader (who can be a manager, a co-worker, or a subordinate). The leader then rallies others into a systematic and frequent "mob-like" behaviour toward the victim.&lt;ref&gt;Shallcross, L, Ramsay, S, &amp; Barker M, (2008) [http://www.lindas.internetbasedfamily.com/f/SHALLCROSS_LINDA1.pdf Workplace Mobbing: Expulsion, Exclusion, and Transformation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713045605/http://www.lindas.internetbasedfamily.com/f/SHALLCROSS_LINDA1.pdf |date=13 July 2011 }}, retrieved 17 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobbing as "downward bullying" by superiors is also known as "bossing", and "upward bullying" by colleagues as "staffing", in some European countries, for instance, in German-speaking regions.&lt;ref&gt;Oberhofer, P [http://www.business-wissen.de/artikel/bossing-und-staffing-mobbing-zwischen-chef-und-mitarbeitern/ Bossing und Staffing], retrieved 25 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological and health effects ===
Victims of workplace mobbing frequently suffer from: [[adjustment disorders]], somatic symptoms, [[psychological trauma]] (e.g., trauma [[tremor]]s or sudden onset [[selective mutism]]), [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), and [[major depression]].&lt;ref name="CPV"&gt;Hillard JR [http://www.innovations-training.com/0804CP_Article4.pdf Workplace mobbing: Are they really out to get your patient?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509035009/http://www.innovations-training.com/0804CP_Article4.pdf |date=9 May 2010 }} Current Psychiatry Volume 8 Number 4 April 2009 Pages 45–51&lt;/ref&gt;

In mobbing targets with PTSD, Leymann notes that the "mental effects were fully comparable with PTSD from war or prison camp experiences." Some patients may develop alcoholism or other substance abuse disorders. Family relationships routinely suffer. Workplace targets and witnesses may even develop brief psychotic episodes [[occupational psychosis]] generally with paranoid symptoms. Leymann estimated that 15% of suicides in Sweden could be directly attributed to workplace mobbing.&lt;ref name="CPV" /&gt;

== At school ==
{{See also|School bullying}}
Following on from the work of Heinemann, Elliot identifies mobbing as a common phenomenon in the form of group bullying at school. It involves 'ganging up' on someone using tactics of [[rumor]], [[innuendo]], [[discrediting]], [[Social rejection|isolating]], [[intimidating]], and above all, making it look as if the targeted person is responsible ([[victim blaming]]).&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;Elliott GP [https://books.google.com/books?id=QHm5dqvPLSwC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PR8&amp;dq=mobbing+bully+checklist ''School Mobbing and Emotional Abuse: See it – Stop it – Prevent it with Dignity and Respect'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== In academia ==
{{See also|Bullying in academia}}
[[Kenneth Westhues]]' study of mobbing in [[academia]] found that [[vulnerability]] was increased by personal differences such as being a foreigner or of a different sex; by working in fields such as music or literature which have recently come under the sway of less objective and more [[post-modern]] scholarship; financial pressure; or having an aggressive superior.&lt;ref name="west" /&gt; Other factors included [[envy]], [[heresy]] and [[campus politics]].&lt;ref name="west"&gt;{{citation |url=http://uv-net.uio.no/wpmu/hedda/2007/05/13/workplace-bullying-in-the-academic-world/ |title=Workplace Bullying in the Academic World? |date=13 May 2007 |publisher=Higher Education Development Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724185410/http://uv-net.uio.no/wpmu/hedda/2007/05/13/workplace-bullying-in-the-academic-world/ |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Checklists ==
Sociologists and authors have created checklists and other tools to identify mobbing behaviour.&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Westhues2"&gt;Westhues K. [http://arts.uwaterloo.ca/~kwesthue/checklist.htm Checklist of Mobbing Indicators] 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kohut MR [https://books.google.com/books?id=aSREF06T2ZQC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA169 ''The Complete Guide to Understanding, Controlling, and Stopping Bullies &amp; Bullying at Work: A Complete Guide for Managers, Supervisors, and Co-Workers'']&lt;/ref&gt; Common approaches to assessing mobbing behavior is through quantifying frequency of mobbing behavior based off a given definition of the behavior or through quantifying what respondents believe encompasses mobbing behavior. These are referred to as "self-labeling" and "behavior experience" methods respectively.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steffgen|first1=Georges|last2=Sischka|first2=Philipp|last3=Schmidt|first3=Alexander|last4=Kohl|first4=Diane|last5=Happ|first5=Christian|title=The Luxembourg Workplace Mobbing Scale|journal=European Journal of Psychological Assessment|date=2016|doi=10.1027/1015-5759/a000381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limitations of some mobbing examination tools are:
* Participant exhaustion due to examination length
* Limited sample exposure resulting in limited result generalizability
* Confounding with constructs that result in the same affect as mobbing but are not purposely harmful 

Common Tools used to measure mobbing behavior are:
* Leyman Inventory of Psychological Terror&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leymann|first1=Heinz|title=Leymann Inventory of Psychological Terror|journal=Tübingen: Deutsche Gellschaft für Verhaltenstherapie Verlag.|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; (LIPT)

The [http://www.kwesthues.com/wami.pdf Waterloo Anti-Mobbing  Instruments (WAMI)] created by [[Kenneth Westhues]] contains a 16 item checklist to identify the signs of mobbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwesthues.com/wami.pdf |title=Conference Summary |format=PDF |date=2004 |accessdate=2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Counteracting Mobbing ==
From an organizational perspective, it has been suggested that mobbing behavior can be curtailed by acknowledging behaviors as mobbing behaviors and that such behaviors result in harm and/or negative consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sperry|first1=Len|title=Workplace mobbing and bullying: a consulting psychology perspective and overview|journal=Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research|date=2009|volume=61|issue=3|pages=165-168|doi=10.1037/a0016936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Precise definitions of such traits are critical due to ambiguity of unacceptable and acceptable behaviors potentially leading to unintentional mobbing behavior. Attenuation of mobbing behavior can further be enhanced by developing policies that explicitly address specific behaviors that are culturally accepted to result in harm or negative affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duffy|first1=Maureen|title=Preventing workplace mobbing and bullying with effective organizational consultation, policies, and legislation|journal=Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research|date=2009|volume=61|issue=3|pages=242-262|doi=10.1037/a0016783}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This provides a framework from which mobbing victims can respond to mobbing. Lack of such a framework may result in a situation where each instance of mobbing is treated on an individual basis with no recourse of prevention. It may also indicate that such behaviors are warranted and within the realm of acceptable behavior within an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferris|first1=Patricia|title=The role of the consulting psychologist in the prevention, detection, and correction of bullying and mobbing in the workplace|journal=Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research|date=2009|volume=61|issue=3|pages=169-189|doi=10.1037/a0016783}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct responses to grievances related to mobbing that are handled outside of a courtroom and training programs outlining antibully-countermeasures also demonstrate a reduction in mobbing behavior.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3784">In [[hydrology]], '''moisture recycling''' or '''precipitation recycling''' refer to the process by which a portion of the [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitated]] [[water]] that [[evapotranspiration|evapotranspired]] from a given area contributes to the precipitation over the same area. Moisture recycling is thus a component of the [[hydrologic cycle]]. The ratio of the locally derived precipitation (&lt;math&gt;P_{L}&lt;/math&gt;) to total precipitation (&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;) is known as the '''recycling ratio''', &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\rho = P_{L}/P&lt;/math&gt;.

The recycling ratio is a diagnostic measure of the potential for interactions between [[Surface-water hydrology|land surface hydrology]] and regional [[climate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koster|first1=R.|last2=Jouzel|first2=J.|last3=Suozzo|first3=R.|last4=Russell|first4=G.|last5=Broecker|first5=W.|last6=Rind|first6=D.|last7=Eagleson|first7=P.|title=Global sources of local precipitation as determined by the Nasa/Giss GCM|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|date=February 1986|volume=13|issue=2|pages=121–124|doi=10.1029/GL013i002p00121|bibcode=1986GeoRL..13..121K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trenberth|first1=Kevin E.|title=Atmospheric Moisture Recycling: Role of Advection and Local Evaporation|journal=Journal of Climate|date=May 1999|volume=12|issue=5|pages=1368–1381|doi=10.1175/1520-0442(1999)012&lt;1368:amrroa&gt;2.0.co;2|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/1520-0442(1999)012%3C1368:AMRROA%3E2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brubaker|first1=Kaye L.|last2=Entekhabi|first2=Dara|last3=Eagleson|first3=P.

The recycling ratio for the entire world is one, and for a single point is zero. Estimates for the recycling ratio for the [[Amazon basin]] range from 24% to 56%, and for the [[Mississippi river|Mississippi basin]] from 21% to 24%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterandclimate.org/MoistureWeb/Overview_Paper.htm Moisture recycling] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116022258/http://www.waterandclimate.org/MoistureWeb/Overview_Paper.htm |date=January 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of moisture recycling has been integrated into the concept of the [[precipitationshed]]. A precipitationshed is the upwind ocean and land surface that contributes evaporation to a given, downwind location's precipitation. In much the same way that a watershed is defined by a topographically explicit area that provides surface runoff, the precipitationshed is a statistically defined area within which evaporation, traveling via moisture recycling, provides precipitation for a specific point.

'''Organic unity''' is the idea that a thing is made up of interdependent parts. For example, a body is made up of its constituent organs, and a society is made up of its constituent social roles.

Organic unity was propounded by the philosopher [[Plato]] as a theory of literature. He explored the idea in such works as ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', and ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]''. But it was [[Aristotle]], one of Plato's students, who advanced the idea and discussed it more explicitly.

In ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE), Aristotle describes organic unity by explaining how writing relies internally on narration and drama to be cohesive; but without balance between the two sides, the work suffers. The main theme of organic unity relies on a free spirited style of writing and by following any guidelines or genre-based habits, the true nature of a work becomes stifled and unreliable on an artistic plane.&lt;ref&gt;(Encyclopædia Britannica)&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of organic unity gained popularity through the [[New Critics]] movement. [[Cleanth Brooks]] (1906–94) played an integral role in modernizing the organic unity principle. Using the poem ''The Well Wrought Urn'' as an example, Brooks related the importance of a work’s ability to flow and maintain a theme, so that the work gains momentum from beginning to end. Organic unity is the common thread that keeps a theme from becoming broken and disjointed as a work moves forward.&lt;ref&gt;(Brooks)&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, a '''pair of pants''' is a [[Surface (topology)|surface]] which is homeomorphic to the three-holed sphere. The name comes from considering one of the removed disks as the waist and the two others as the cuffs of a [[Trousers|pair of pants]].

Pairs of pants are used as building blocks for compact surfaces in various theories. Two important applications are to [[hyperbolic geometry]], where decompositions of [[closed surface]]s into pairs of pants are used to construct the [[Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates]] on [[Teichmüller space]], and in [[Topological quantum field theory]] where they are the simplest non-trivial [[cobordism]]s between 1-dimensional manifolds.

== Pants and pants decomposition ==

=== Pants as topological surfaces ===

[[File:Pants in the plane.png|thumb|A pair of pants as a plane domain (in blue, with the boundary in red)]]

As said in the lede a pair of pants is any surface which is homeomorphic to a sphere with three holes, which formally are three open disks with pairwise disjoint closures removed from the sphere. Thus a pair of pants is a compact surface of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] zero with three boundary components. 

The [[Euler characteristic]] of a pair of pants is equal to -1. Among all surfaces of negative Euler characteristic it has the maximal one; the only other surface with this property is the punctured torus (a [[torus]] minus an open disk).

=== Pants decompositions ===

[[File:Pants decomposition genus2.png|thumb|Two different pants decompositions for the surface of genus 2]]

The importance of the pairs of pants in the study of surfaces stems from the following property: define the complexity of a connected compact surface &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of [[Surface (topology)#Classification of closed surfaces|genus]] &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; boundary components to be &lt;math&gt;\xi(S) = 3g - 3 + k&lt;/math&gt;, and for a non-connected surface take the sum over all components. Then the only surfaces with negative Euler characteristic and complexity zero are disjoint unions of pairs of pants. Furthermore, for any surface &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and any [[simple closed curve]] &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; which is not [[Homotopy|homotopic]] to a boundary component, the compact surface obtain by cutting &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; along &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; has a complexity that is strictly less than &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. In this sense pairs of pants are the only "irreducible" surfaces among all surfaces of negative Euler characteristic.

By an immediate recursion this implies that for any surface there is a system of simple closed curves which cut the surface into pairs of pants. This is called a ''pants decomposition'' for the surface, and the curves are called the ''cuffs'' of the decomposition. Of course there is no unicity in the decompositions obtained by this method, but by quantifying the argument one sees that all pants decomposition of a given surface have the same number of curves which is exactly the complexity.{{sfn|Ratcliffe|2006|loc=Theorem 9.7.1}} For connected surfaces a pants decomposition has exactly &lt;math&gt;2g - 2 + k&lt;/math&gt; pants.

A collection of simple closed curves on a surface is a pants decomposition if and only if they are disjoint, no two of them are homotopic and none is homotopic to a boundary component, and the collection is maximal for these properties.

=== The pants complex ===

[[File:Pants moves.png|thumb|Elementary moves between pants decomposition]]

A given surface has infinitely many distinct pants decompositions (we understand two decompositions to be distinct when they are not homotopic). One way to try to understand the relations between all these decompositions is the ''pants complex associated to the surface''.  This is a graph with vertex set the pants decompositions of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, and two vertices are joined when they are related by an elementary move, which is one of the two following operations:
*take a curve &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in the decomposition in a one-holed torus and replace it by a curve in the torus intersecting it only once ; 
*Take a curve &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in the decomposition in a four-holed sphere and replace it by a curve in the sphere intersecting it only twice.

The pants complex is connected{{sfn|Hatcher|Thurston|1980}} (meaning any two pants decompositions are related by a sequence of elementary moves) and has infinite diameter (meaning that there is no upper bounds on the number of moves needed to get from one decomposition to the other). In the particular case when the surface has complexity 1, the pants complex is isomorphic to the [[Farey graph]]. 

The action of the [[mapping class group]] on the pants complex is of interest for studying this group. For example, Allen Hatcher and William Thurston have used it to give a proof of the fact that it is [[Finitely presented group|finitely presented]].

== Pants in hyperbolic geometry ==

===Moduli space of hyperbolic pants===

The interesting hyperbolic structures on a pair of pants are easily classified.{{sfn|Ratcliffe|2006|loc=Theorem 9.7.3}}

:''For every &lt;math&gt;(\ell_1, \ell_2, \ell_3) \in ]0, +\infty[&lt;/math&gt; there is a hyperbolic surface &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; which is homeomorphic to a pair of pants and whose boundary components are [[totally geodesic]] and of lengths &lt;math&gt;\ell_1, \ell_2, \ell_3&lt;/math&gt;. Such a surface is uniquely determined by the &lt;math&gt;\ell_i&lt;/math&gt;up to isometry. ''

By taking the length of a cuff to be equal to zero one obtains a complete metric on the pair of pants minus the cuff, which is replaced by a [[Cusp neighborhood|cusp]]. This structure is of finite volume.

=== Pants and hexagons ===

The geometric proof of the classification in the previous paragraph is important to understand the structure of hyperbolic pants. It proceeds as follows: given an hyperbolic pair of pants with totally geodesic boundary the three geodesic arcs joining the cuffs pairwise and which are perpendicular to them at their ends are uniquely determined, and are called the ''seams'' of the pants.

Cutting the pants along the seams one gets two right-angled hyperbolic hexagons which have three alternate sides of matching lengths. The following lemma can be proven with elementary hyperbolic geometry.{{sfn|Ratcliffe|2006|loc=Theorem 3.5.14}}

:''If two right-angled hyperbolic hexagons have each three alternate sides of the same length then they are isometric to each other.''

So we see that the pair of pants is the [[Double (manifold)|double]] of a right-angled hexagon along alternate sides. Since the isometry class of the hexagon is also uniquely determined by the lengths of the sides that were not glued the classification of pants follows from that of hexagons.

When a length of one cuff is zero one replaces the corresponding side in the right-angled hexagon by an ideal vertex.

=== Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates ===
{{Main article | Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates}}

A point in the Teichmüller space of a surface &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is represented by a pair &lt;math&gt;(M, f)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a complete hyperbolic surface and &lt;math&gt;f: S \to M&lt;/math&gt; a diffeomorphism.

If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; has a pants decomposition by curves &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i&lt;/math&gt; then one can parametrise Teichmüller pairs by the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates which are defined as follows. The ''cuff lengths'' &lt;math&gt;\ell_i&lt;/math&gt; are simply the lengths of the closed geodesics homotopic to the &lt;math&gt;f(\gamma_i)&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''twist parameters'' &lt;math&gt;\tau_i&lt;/math&gt; are harder to define. They correspond to how much one turns when gluing two pairs of pants along &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i&lt;/math&gt;: this defines them modulo &lt;math&gt;\ell_i\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt;. One can refine the definition (using either analytic continuation{{sfn|Imayoshi|Taniguchi|1992|p=63}} or geometric techniques) to obtain twist parameters valued in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; (roughly, the point is that when one makes a full turn one changes the point in Teichmüller space by precomposing &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with a [[Dehn twist]] around &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i&lt;/math&gt;).

=== The pants complex and the Weil-Petersson metric ===

One can define a map from the pants complex to Teichmüller space, which takes a pants decomposition to an arbitrarily chosen point in the region where the cuff part of the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates are bounded by a large enough constant. It is a [[quasi-isometry]] when Teichmüller space is endowed with the [[Weil-Petersson metric]], which has proven useful in the study of this metric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Brock | first=Jeff | chapter=Pants decompositions and the Weil-Petersson metric | title=Complex Manifolds and Hyperbolic Geometry | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pairs of pants and Schottky groups ===

These structures correspond to [[Schottky groups]] on two generators (more precisely, if the quotient of the [[hyperbolic plane]] by a Schottky group on two generators is homeomorphic to the interior of a pair of pants then its convex core is an hyperbolic pair of pants as described above, and all are obtained as such).

== 2-dimensional cobordisms ==
{{Main article | Topological quantum field theory}}

[[File:Stef57 Cobordisme en dim 1.jpg|thumb|This [[Link (knot theory)|link]] cobordism between the [[Hopf link]] and the [[unlink]] is topologically a pair of pants.]]

A cobordism between two n-dimensional closed manifolds is a compact (n+1)-dimensional manifold whose boundary is the disjoint union of the two manifolds. The category of cobordisms of dimension n+1 is the category with objects the closed manifolds of dimension n, and morphisms the cobordisms between them (note that the definition of a cobordism includes the identification of the boundary to the manifolds). Note that one of the manifolds can be empty; in particular a closed manifold of dimension n+1 is viewed as an endomorphism of the empty set. One can also compose two cobordisms when the end of the first is equal to the start of the second. A n-dimensional topological quantum field theory (TQFT) is a monoidal functor from the category of n-cobordisms to the category of complex vector space (where multiplication is given by the tensor product).

In particular, cobordisms between 1-dimensional manifolds (which are unions of circles) are compact surfaces whose boundary has been separated into two disjoint unions of circles. Two-dimensional TQFTs correspond to [[Frobenius algebra]]s, where the circle (the only connected closed 1-manifold) maps to the underlying vector space of the algebra, while the pair of pants gives a product or coproduct, depending on how the boundary components are grouped – which is commutative or cocommutative. Further, the map associated with a disk gives a counit (trace) or unit (scalars), depending on grouping of boundary, which completes the correspondence.

'''Parallel thinking''' is a term coined by [[Edward de Bono]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward De Bono, ''Parallel thinking: from Socratic thinking to de Bono thinking'', Viking 1994 {{ISBN|0-670-85126-4}}, page x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=frame&gt;David Moseley, Vivienne Baumfield, Julian Elliott, ''Frameworks for thinking: a handbook for teaching and learning'', Cambridge University Press 2005, {{ISBN|0-521-84831-8}}, page 135&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel thinking is described as a constructive alternative to: "adversarial thinking"; [[debate]]; and the approaches exemplified by Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle (whom de Bono refers to as the "Greek gang of three" (GG3) &lt;ref&gt;Edward de Bono coined the term "The gang of three" to refer to three Greek philosophers: Socrates, Plato and Aristotle - [https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/apr/24/highereducationprofile.academicexperts see Guardian article April 24th 2007] &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Edward De Bono, ''Parallel thinking: from Socratic thinking to de Bono thinking'', Viking 1994
{{ISBN|0-670-85126-4}}, page 36–38&lt;/ref&gt;). In general parallel thinking is a further development of the well known [[lateral thinking]] processes, focusing even more on explorations—looking for ''what can be'' rather than for ''what is''.

==Definition==
Parallel thinking is defined as a thinking process where focus is split in specific directions. When done in a group it effectively avoids the consequences of the [[adversarial]] approach (as used in courts).

In adversarial debate, the objective is to [[Proof (truth)|prove]] or [[disprove]] statements put forward by the parties (normally two). This is also known as the [[dialectic]] approach. In Parallel Thinking, practitioners put forward as many statements as possible in several (preferably more than two) parallel tracks. This leads to ''exploration'' of a subject where all participants can contribute, in parallel, with knowledge, facts, feelings, etc.

Crucial to the method is that the process is done in a disciplined manner, and that all participants play along and contribute ''in parallel''. Thus each participant must stick to the specific track.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6071">'''ParoleWatch''' was a privately run website started in 1997 that provided public access to data on convicted felons in New York State who were coming up for parole review. The project's aim was to let citizens "communicate their views on would-be parolees to the New York State Parole Board."&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.wired.com/politics/law/news/1997/12/8838|title=Web Watchers Track, Trip Up Parolees|work=Wired|accessdate=2011-01-23|date=December 3, 1997| last=Lindsey| first=Daryl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
"ParoleWatch will not be the first such site" with information on potential parolees, ''The New York Times'' reported in April 1997. "For almost a year, the New Jersey State Parole Board has published on the Web a list of inmates eligible for parole. But ParoleWatch might well be the first parole Web site published by a private organization."&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{Cite news|title=New York Group Planning to Use Web Site To Notify Public on Felons' Parole Status|work=The New York Times|date=April 17, 1997|last=Mendels| first=Pamela}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for the [[Murder of Polly Klaas|KlaasKids Foundation]], ParoleWatch's founder predicted that "Eventually people in every state will be just a few mouse-clicks away from this kind of data."&lt;ref name="klaaskids"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.klaaskids.org/1998/Winter1998.pdf | title=Keeping America's "Most Unwanted" Behind Bars | accessdate=2011-01-30 | author=Diamond, Joe | date=Winter 1998 | work=Klaas Action Review | publisher=KlaasKids Foundation | pages=3 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216214825/http://klaaskids.org/1998/Winter1998.pdf | archivedate=2010-12-16 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ParoleWatch was organized by the anti-crime group Take Back New York, and grew out of the group's grass-roots efforts to block the parole of a convicted murderer.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt; The [[New York State Department of Correctional Services]] provided the data for ParoleWatch.

''The New York Times'' wrote that the project had "prominent supporters." New York divorce lawyer [[Raoul Felder]] served as chairman of ParoleWatch's advisory board, "which also includes several well-known victims' rights advocates."&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;

Felder told ''The Times'' "he backed the project because too often victims receive no notification when offenders are up for parole. 'There is a blank spot in the criminal justice system,' Felder said. 'We put these guys away. They get out and the victims usually have no way of knowing when they get out.' ParoleWatch, he said, 'gives them a fair shot.'&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;

According to the ''New York Post'', one effect of ParoleWatch was to turn parole reform into a national issue.&lt;ref name="nyp"&gt;{{cite news | title=Don't Parole Joel | author=New York Post editorial board | date=1997-12-23 | publisher=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In his book ''The Control Revolution: How the Internet is Putting Individuals in Charge and Changing the World We Know'', [[Andrew L. Shapiro]] said that ParoleWatch "demonstrates much of what is possible when it comes to individuals using interactive technology to transform politics -- and what might go wrong. ... ParoleWatch does a real public service by giving citizens access to data about violent offenders and their release dates." But it prompted "people to 'take action'...based on a very limited view of each case."&lt;ref name="control"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Control Revolution: How the Internet is Putting Individuals in Charge and Changing the World We Know|last=Shapiro|first=Andrew|year=1999|pages=150–153|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] had voiced similar criticisms when ParoleWatch was launched. In an interview with ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', Take Back New York Executive Director Joe Diamond responded to the ACLU's objections by "conced[ing] that Parolewatch 'is not overly concerned with the prisoner's point of view.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/1997/08/6347 |work=Wired | title=Scans: Scarlet Letters from Cyberspace|accessdate=2017-04-28 |date=August 26, 1997 |last=Richtel |first=Matt |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106104343/http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/1997/08/6347 |archivedate=November 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shapiro wrote that, as a victims' rights organization, ParoleWatch was "fully entitled to express its views on crime and safety" and that law-and-order advocates have always "had the ability to lobby parole boards." In Shapiro's view, however, there was a danger "in ParoleWatch's sophisticated harnessing of new technology. It uses the pinpoint accuracy of a computer database to match citizens in certain neighborhoods with felons who might be released there, and it relies on the Net's interactivity to give folks a free and easy way to voice their opposition -- without having to take time to become well informed, let alone to hear the views of others."

Some of the criticism of ParoleWatch was more tongue-in-cheek. "A better name for the Web site address is www.rotinjail.com," said activist attorney [[Ron Kuby]].&lt;ref name=nydn&gt;{{cite news|last=Fenner|first=Austin|title=Web used to monitor those up for parole|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=February 23, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rights}}
A '''patient's bill of rights''' is a list of guarantees for those receiving medical care. It may take the form of a law or a non-binding declaration. Typically a patient's [[bill of rights]] guarantees patients information, fair treatment, and [[autonomy]] over medical decisions, among other rights.

==United Kingdom==

In the UK, the [[Patient's Charter]] was introduced and revised in the 1990s. It was replaced by the [[NHS Constitution for England]].

==United States==
In the [[United States]] there have been a number of attempts to enshrine a patient's bill of rights in law, including a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] rejected by Congress in 2001.

===Bill of 2001===
[[File:Patients Bill of Rights Ron Klink.jpg|thumb|A rally for the patients' bill of rights proposed in 2001, with [[Bill Clinton]], [[Joe Hoeffel]], [[Ron Klink]], [[Ed Rendell]], and [[Chaka Fattah]].]]
The [[United States Congress]] considered a bill designed to safeguard patients' rights in 2001. The "Bipartisan Patient Protection Act" ([https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/senate-bill/1052 S.1052]), sponsored by Senators [[Edward Kennedy]] and [[John McCain]],  contained new rules for what [[health maintenance organization]]s had to cover and granted new rights for patients to sue in state or federal courts, if they are denied needed care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Bipartisan Patients' Bill Of Rights Act| last=Dubno| first=Dan| publisher=CBS| date=June 18, 2001| accessdate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] passed differing versions of the proposed law. Although both bills would have provided patients key rights, such as prompt access to [[emergency care]] and [[medical specialist]]s, only the Senate-passed measure would provide patients with adequate means to enforce their rights.  The Senate's proposal would have conferred a broad array of rights on patients. It would have ensured that patients with health care plans had the right to:
*have their medical decisions made by a doctor;
*see a medical specialist;
*go to the closest emergency room;

The bill was passed by the US Senate by a vote of 59–36 in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Senate Vote #220 in 2001. S. 1052 (107th): Bipartisan Patient Protection Act |website=GovTrack |url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/107-2001/s220 |access-date=3 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was then amended by the House of Representatives and returned to the Senate. However, it ultimately failed.

===Industry resistance===

[[Wendell Potter]], former senior executive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/Health/story?id=7911195&amp;page=1 |title=How Insurance Companies Hurt Policyholders - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2009-06-24 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Cigna]] turned whistleblower, has written that the insurance industry has worked to kill "any reform that might interfere with insurers' ability to increase profits" by engaging in extensive and well-funded, anti-reform campaigns. The industry, however, "goes to great lengths to keep its involvement in these campaigns hidden from public view," including the use of "front groups." Indeed, in a successful 1998 effort to kill the Patient Bill of Rights then,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"the insurers formed a front group
called the Health Benefits Coalition to kill efforts to pass a
Patients Bill of Rights. While it was billed as a broad-based business
coalition that was led by the [[National Federation of Independent Business]] and included the [[United States Chamber of Commerce|U.S. Chamber of Commerce]], the Health
Benefits Coalition in reality got the lion’s share of its funding and
guidance from the big insurance companies and their trade
associations. Like most front groups, the Health Benefits Coalition was set up and run out of one of Washington’s biggest P.R. firms. The P.R. firm
provided all the staff work for the Coalition. The tactics worked. Industry allies in Congress made sure the Patients’ Bill of Rights would not become law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Potter |first=Wendell |url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2009/09/15/potter_pr/index.html |title=How corporate P.R. works to kill healthcare reform |publisher=Salon.com |date=2009-09-15 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===AAPS proposal===
{{Unreferenced section |date=September 2016}}
Some have cited differences between [[negative and positive rights|positive rights]] and [[political freedom|personal freedoms]]. Asserting that medical care "must be rendered under conditions that are acceptable to both patient and physician," the [[Association of American Physicians and Surgeons]] adopted a list of patient freedoms in 1990, which was modified and adopted as a 'patients' bill of rights' in 1995:

"All patients should be guaranteed the following freedoms:

*To seek consultation with the physician(s) of their choice;
*To contract with their physician(s) on mutually agreeable terms;
*To be treated confidentially, with access to their records limited to those involved in their care or designated by the patient;
*''To use their own resources to purchase the care of their choice;''
*''To refuse medical treatment even if it is recommended by their physician(s);''
*''To be informed about their medical condition, the risks and benefits of treatment and appropriate alternatives;''
*''To refuse third-party interference in their medical care, and to be confident that their actions in seeking or declining medical care will not result in third-party-imposed penalties for patients or physicians;''
*''To receive full disclosure of their insurance plan in plain language, including:''
#''CONTRACTS: A copy of the contract between the physician and health care plan, and between the patient or employer and the plan;''
#''INCENTIVES: Whether participating physicians are offered financial incentives to reduce treatment or ration care;''
#''COST: The full cost of the plan, including copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles;''

'''Physis''' (Greek: {{lang|grc|φύσις|italic=yes}} ''phusis'') is a Greek [[theology|theological]], [[philosophy|philosophical]], and [[science|scientific]] term usually translated into English as "[[nature (philosophy)|nature]]".

The term is central to [[Greek philosophy]], and as a consequence to [[Western philosophy]] as a whole.
In [[pre-Socratic]] usage, ''phusis'' contrasted with {{lang|grc|νόμος}} ''nomos'' "law, human convention"
Since  [[Aristotle]], however, the ''physical'' (the subject matter of ''[[physics]]'', properly  {{lang|grc|τὰ φυσικά}} "natural things") has more typically  been juxtaposed to the ''[[metaphysics|metaphysical]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Discussed in Aristotle's works so titled, ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' "Physis, translated since the Third Century B.C. usually as "nature" and less frequently as "essence", means one thing for the presocratic philosophers and quite another thing for Plato." Welch, Kathleen Ethel. "Keywords from Classical Rhetoric: The Example of Physis." Rhetoric Society Quarterly 17.2 (1987): 193-204. Print.
The Pontifical Academy of Sciences. ''Evolving Concepts of Nature''. Proceedings of the Plenary Session, 24–28 October 2014, Acta 23, Vatican City, 2015. [http://www.casinapioiv.va/content/accademia/en/publications/acta/acta23.html link].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-socratic usage ==
The word φύσις is a verbal noun based on [[:wikt:φύω|φύω]] "to grow, to appear" ([[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/bʰuH-|cognate]] with English "to be"). In [[Homeric Greek]] it is used quite literally, of the manner of growth of a particular species of plant.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Odyssey]]'' 10.302-3:  {{lang|grc|ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοι '''φύσιν''' αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε}}. (So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its '''nature'''.) ''[[Odyssey]]''  (ed. A.T. Murray).&lt;/ref&gt;  

In [[pre-Socratic philosophers|pre-Socratic]] philosophy, beginning with [[Heraclitus]], ''phusis'' in keeping with its etymology of "growing, becoming" is always used in the sense of the "natural" ''development'', although the focus might lie either with the origin, or the process, or the end result of the process. There is some evidence that by the 6th century BC, beginning with the [[Ionian School (philosophy)|Ionian School]], the word could also be used 
in the comprehensive sense, as referring to "''all'' things", as it were "Nature" in the sense of "[[Universe]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Naddaf, ''The Greek Concept of Nature'', SUNY Press, 2005, p. 3.
Guthrie, W. K. C., ''Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'' (volume 2 of his ''History of Greek Philosophy''), Cambridge UP, 1965.{{page needed|date=December 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Sophist]] tradition, the term stood in opposition to ''[[:wikt:nomos|nomos]]'' ({{lang|grc|νόμος}}), "[[law]]" or "[[convention (norm)|custom]]", in the debate on which parts of human existence are natural, and which are due to convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dunkie |first1=Roger |title=The Classical Origins of Western Culture: The Core Studies 1 Study Guide |url=http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/studyguide/studygde.htm |accessdate=30 January 2012 |series=Brooklyn College Core Curriculum Series |date=1986 |publisher=[[Brooklyn College]] |location=[[Brooklyn, NY]]  |chapter=Philosophical background of the 5th Century B.C. |chapterurl=http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/studyguide/sophists.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The contrast of ''phisis'' vs. ''[[:wikt:nomos|nomos]]'' could be applied to any subject, much like the modern contrast of "[[nature vs. nurture]]".

== In Plato's Laws ==
In book 10 of ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'', Plato criticizes those who write works ''peri phuseōs''. The criticism is that such authors tend to focus on a purely "naturalistic" explanation of the world, ignoring the role of "intention" or ''technē'', and thus becoming prone to the error of naive [[History_of_atheism#Classical_Greece_and_Rome|atheism]]. Plato accuses even [[Theogony|Hesiod]] of this, for the reason that the gods in Hesiod "grow" out of primordial entities after the physical universe had been established.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Naddaf, ''The Greek Concept of Nature'' (2005), 1f.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Because those who use the term mean to say that nature is the first creative power; but if the soul turns out to be the primeval element, and not fire or air, then in the truest sense and beyond other things the soul may be said to exist ''by'' nature; and this would be true if you proved that the soul is older than the body, but not otherwise."
::— Plato's Laws, Book 10(892c) – ''translation by Benjamin Jowett''

== Aristotle ==
Aristotle sought out the definition of "physis" to prove that there was more than one definition of "physis", and more than one way to interpret nature. "Though Aristotle retains the ancient sense of "physis" as growth, he insists that an adequate definition of "physis" requires the different perspectives of the [[four causes]] (aitia): material, efficient, formal, and final."&lt;ref name="Rhetoric Reclaimed"&gt;Atwill, Janet. "The Interstices of Nature, Spontaneity, and Chance." Rhetoric Reclaimed: Aristotle and the Liberal Arts Tradition. Ithaca, NY: Cornell UP, 1998. N. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that nature itself contained its own source of matter (material), power/motion (efficiency), form, and end (final). A unique feature about Aristotle's definition of "physis" was his relationship between art and nature. Aristotle said that "physis" (nature) is dependent on [[techne]] (art). "The critical distinction between art and nature concerns their different efficient causes: nature is its own source of motion, whereas techne always requires a source of motion outside itself."&lt;ref name="Rhetoric Reclaimed" /&gt; What Aristotle was trying to bring to light, was that art does not contain within itself its form or source of motion. Consider the process of an acorn becoming an oak tree. This is a natural process that has its own driving force behind it. There is no external force pushing this acorn to its final state, rather it is progressively developing towards one specific end ([[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]).


==Biblical usage==
Though φύσις was often used in Hellenistic philosophy, it is used only 14 times in the New Testament (10 of those in the writings of Paul).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balz|first1=Horst Robert|title=Exegetical dictionary of the New Testament|publisher=[[William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company]]|location=Michigan1994|isbn=9780802828033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its meaning varies throughout Paul's writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verbrugge|first1=Verlyn D.|title=New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology|date=2000|publisher=[[Zondervan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; One usage refers to the established or natural order of things, as in ''Romans 2:14'' where Paul writes "For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by ''nature'' do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Romans|2:14|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Danker|first1=Frederick W.|title=A Greek-English lexicon of the New Testament and other early Christian literature|date=2014|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another use of φύσις in the sense of "natural order" is ''Romans 1:26'' where he writes "the men likewise gave up ''natural'' relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another".&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Romans|1:26-1:27|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Danker|first1=Frederick W.|title=A Greek-English lexicon of the New Testament and other early Christian literature|date=2014|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''1 Corinthians 11:14'', Paul asks "Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Corinthians|11:13|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balz|first1=Horst Robert|title=Exegetical dictionary of the New Testament|publisher=William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company|location=Michigan1994|isbn=9780802828033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This use of φύσις as referring to a "natural order" in ''Romans 1:26'' and ''1 Corinthians 11:14''  may have been influenced by [[Stoicism]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Greek philosophers, including [[Aristotle]] and the Stoics are credited with distinguishing between man-made laws and a [[natural law]] of universal validity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of the Classical World|date=2007|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192801463.001.0001/acref-9780192801463-e-1250.|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Gerhard Kittel]] states that the Stoic philosophers were not able to combine the concepts of νόμος (law) and φύσις (nature) to produce the concept of "natural law" in the sense that was made possible by [[Judeo-Christian]] theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kittel|first1=Gerhard|title=Theological Dictionary of the New Testament|publisher=Eerdman's Publishing Company|location=Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline theology]] of [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] by [[Grace in Christianity|grace]], Paul writes in ''Ephesians 2:3'' that "we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by ''nature'' children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. In the next verse he writes, "by grace you have been saved." &lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Ephesians|2:3-2:4|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verbrugge|first1=Verlyn D.|title=New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology|date=2000|publisher=Zondervan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage in patristic theology ==
Theologians of the early Christian period differed in the usage of this term. In [[School of Antioch|Antiochene]] circles, it connoted the humanity or divinity of Christ conceived as a concrete set of characteristics or attributes. In [[Alexandrian School|Alexandrine]] thinking, it meant a concrete individual or independent existent and approximated to [[hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]] without being a synonym.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, J.N.D. ''Early Christian Doctrines'' A&amp;C Black(1965) p.318&lt;/ref&gt;  While it refers to much the same thing as [[ousia]] it is more empirical and descriptive focussing on function while ousia is metaphysical and focuses more on reality.&lt;ref name="GiPT"&gt;Prestige, G.L. ''God in Patristic Thought'', SPCK (1964), p.234&lt;/ref&gt; Although found in the context of the [[Trinity|Trinitarian debate]], it is chiefly important in the [[Christology]] of [[Cyril of Alexandria]].&lt;ref name="GiPT"/&gt;

== Modern usage ==
The Greek adjective ''phusikos'' is represented  in various forms in modern English:
As ''[[physics]]'' "the study of nature", as ''[[:wikt:physical|physical]]'' (via Middle Latin ''physicalis'') referring both to physics (the study of nature, the material universe) and to the [[human body]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=physical |title=Physical |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |accessdate=20 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[physiology]] (''physiologia'') is of 16th-century coinage ([[Jean Fernel]]). The term ''physique'', for "the bodily constitution of a person", is a 19th-century loan from French. 

In medicine the suffix ''-physis'' occurs in such compounds as ''[[symphysis]]'', ''[[epiphysis]]'', and a few others, in the sense of "a growth". The physis also refers to the "[[Epiphyseal plate|growth plate]]", or site of growth at the end of long bones.

This includes violence against religious institutions, people, objects, or events when the violence is motivated to some degree by some religious aspect of the target or by the precepts of the attacker. Religious violence does not refer exclusively to acts committed by religious groups, but includes acts committed by secular groups against religious groups.

Violence is a very broad concept and it is also difficult to define since it can be used against non-human objects.&lt;ref name="Houben Kooji" /&gt; Furthermore, the term can denote a wide variety of experiences such as blood shedding, physical harm, forcing against personal freedom, passionate conduct or language, or emotions such as fury and passion.&lt;ref name="Ralph Tanner" /&gt;

Religion is a complex and problematic concept.&lt;ref name="50 great1" /&gt; It is a modern western-compartmentalized concept that was not found anywhere before the 1500s and despite it being recently invented, there is no scholarly consensus over what a religion is.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald" /&gt;&lt;ref name="50 great1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nongbri" /&gt; In general, religion is conceived as an abstraction which entails beliefs, doctrines, and sacred places even though the ancient cultures that wrote Holy Scriptures (e.g. Bible, Quran, etc) did not have such a concept in their holy scriptures, language, or history.&lt;ref name="Nongbri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="50 great1" /&gt; Decades of anthropological, sociological, and psychological research have shown that the assumption that religious beliefs and values are tightly integrated in an individual's mind or that religious practices and behaviors follow directly from religious beliefs, is actually rare. People’s religious ideas are fragmented, loosely connected, and context-dependent just like in all other domains of culture and life.&lt;ref name="chaves"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chaves|first1=Mark|title=SSSR Presidential Address Rain Dances in the Dry Season: Overcoming the Religious Congruence Fallacy|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|date=March 2010|volume=49|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01489.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, religions, ethical systems, and societies rarely promote violence as an end in itself since violence is universally undesirable.&lt;ref name="Houben Kooji"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Houben|editor1-first=Jan|editor2-last=van Kooji|editor2-first=Karel|title=Violence Denied : Violence, Non-violence and the Rationalization of Violence in South Asian Cultural History|date=1999|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden ; Boston ; Köln|isbn=9004113444|pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, there is a universal tension between the general desire to avoid violence and the acceptance of justifiable uses of violence to prevent a "greater evil" that permeates all cultures.&lt;ref name="Houben Kooji" /&gt; Religious violence, like all violence, is a cultural process that is context-dependent and very complex.&lt;ref name=Rowley2 /&gt; Oversimplifications of religion and violence often lead to misguided understandings and exaggerations of causes for why some people commit violence and why most do not commit violence.&lt;ref name=Rowley2 /&gt; Religious violence is primarily the domain of the violent "actor", which may be distinguished between individual and collective forms of violence. Overall, religious violence is perpetrated for a wide variety of [[ideology|ideological]] reasons and is generally only one of the contributing social and political factors that leads to unrest.

Studies of supposed cases of religious violence often conclude that violence is strongly driven by ethnic animosities rather than by religious worldviews.&lt;ref name="Omar"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Omar|editor1-first=Irfan|editor2-last=Duffey|editor2-first=Michael|title=Peacemaking and the Challenge of Violence in World Religions|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9781118953426|page=1|ref=Omar Peacemaking|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, scholars have questioned the very concept of "religious violence" and the extent to which religious, political, [[War#Economic|economic]], or [[ethnic conflict|ethnic]] aspects of a conflict are even meaningful.&lt;ref name="Cavanaugh myth"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Myth of Religious Violence|first=William|last=Cavanaugh |publisher=Oxford University Press US,|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some observe that the very concept of "religion" is a modern invention and not something that is universal across cultures or historical and thereby makes "religious violence" a myth.&lt;ref name="Cavanaugh myth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt; Since all cases of violence and war include social, political, and economic dimensions and since there is no consensus on definitions of "religion" among scholars and no way to isolate "religion" from the rest of the more likely motivational dimensions, it is incorrect to label any violent event as "religious".&lt;ref name="50 great"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morreall|first1=John|last2=Sonn|first2=Tamara|title=50 Great Myths of Religion|date=2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9780470673508|pages=39–44|chapter=Myth 8.

==History of the concept of religion==
{{main|Definition of religion}}

Religion is a [[modern era|modern]] [[Western culture|Western]] concept.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv|first=Timothy|last=Fitzgerald|title=Discourse on Civility and Barbarity|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of religion is not found anywhere before the 1500s.&lt;ref name="50 great1" /&gt; Furthermore, parallel concepts are not found in many cultures and there is no equivalent term for "religion" in many languages.&lt;ref name="50 great1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morreall|first1=John|last2=Sonn|first2=Tamara|title=50 Great Myths of Religion|date=2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9780470673508|pages=12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have found it difficult to develop a consistent definition, with some giving up on the possibility of a definition&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM. (2002). 'Sociological Definitions, Language Games and the "Essence" of Religion'. Method &amp; theory in the study of religion, vol 14, no. 1, pp. 61–83. [http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3073/1/McKinnon_Definition_of_Religion_author_version_no_format.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josephson, Jason Ānanda. (2012) ''The Invention of Religion in Japan.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; and others rejecting the term entirely.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Others argue that regardless of its definition, it is not appropriate to apply it to non-Western cultures.&lt;ref name=dubuisson&gt;Daniel Dubuisson, ''The Western Construction of Religion''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"/&gt;

The modern concept of "religion" as an abstraction which entails distinct sets of beliefs or doctrines is a recent invention in the English language since such usage began with texts from the 17th century due to the splitting of [[Christendom]] during the [[Protestant Reformation]] and more prevalent [[colonization]] or [[globalization]] in the [[Age of Discovery|age of exploration]] which involved contact with numerous foreign and indigenous cultures with non-European languages.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harrison |first1=Peter |title=The Territories of Science and Religion |date=2015 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=022618448X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Religion enlightenment"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Peter|title='Religion' and the Religions in the English Enlightenment|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521892937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient sacred texts like the [[Bible]] and the [[Quran]] did not have a concept of religion in their original languages and neither did their authors or the cultures to which they belonged.&lt;ref name=Nongbri&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nongbri |first1=Brent |title=Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept |date=2013 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=030015416X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="50 great1" /&gt;
It was in the 19th century that the terms "[[Buddhism]]", "[[Hinduism]]", "[[Taoism]]", and "[[Confucianism]]" first emerged.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Invention Japan"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Josephson |first1=Jason Ananda |title=The Invention of Religion in Japan |date=2012 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0226412342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no precise equivalent of "religion" in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and [[Judaism]] does not draw clear distinctions between religious, national, racial, or ethnic identities.&lt;ref&gt;Hershel Edelheit, Abraham J. Edelheit,  [https://www.questia.com/library/book/history-of-zionism-a-handbook-and-dictionary-by-abfaham-j-edelheit-hershel-edelheit.jsp History of Zionism: A Handbook and Dictionary], p.3, citing [[Solomon Zeitlin]], ''The Jews. Race, Nation, or Religion?'' (Philadelphia: Dropsie College Press, 1936).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of violence==

Violence is difficult to define because the term is a "thick concept" in that it broadly carries a descriptive and evaluative components which ranges from harming non-human objects to human self-harm.&lt;ref name="Houben Kooji" /&gt; Ralph Tanner cites the definition of violence in the Oxford English Dictionary as "far beyond (the infliction of) pain and the shedding of blood." He argues that, although violence clearly encompasses injury to persons or property, it also includes "the forcible interference with personal freedom, violent or passionate conduct or language (and) finally passion or fury."&lt;ref name="Ralph Tanner"&gt;{{cite book |title=Violence and Religion: Cross-cultural Opinions and Consequences |author= Ralph E.S. Tanner|publisher=Concept Publishing Company |year=2007 |pages=5–6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3xQXYpfe0cYC&amp;pg=PA5 |isbn= 9788180693762}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, Abhijit Nayak writes:

The word "violence" can be defined to extend far beyond pain and shedding blood. It carries the meaning of physical force, violent language, fury, and, more importantly, forcible interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=International Review of Mission |first=Abhijit |last=Nayak |title=Crusade Violence: Understanding and Overcoming the Impact of Mission Among Muslims |volume=97|issue=386–387|pages=273–291 |date=July–October 2008|publisher=World Council of Churches |doi=10.1111/j.1758-6631.2008.tb00645.x |accessdate=2010-11-23 |url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-10493656/Crusade-violence-understanding-and-overcoming.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terence Fretheim writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

For many people, ... only physical violence truly qualifies as violence. But, certainly, violence is more than killing people, unless one includes all those words and actions that kill people slowly. The effect of limitation to a “killing fields” perspective is the widespread neglect of many other forms of violence. We must insist that violence also refers to that which is psychologically destructive, that which demeans, damages, or depersonalizes others. In view of these considerations, violence may be defined as follows: any action, verbal or nonverbal, oral or written, physical or psychical, active or passive, public or private, individual or institutional/societal, human or divine, in whatever degree of intensity, that abuses, violates, injures, or kills. Some of the most pervasive and most dangerous forms of violence are those that are often hidden from view (against women and children, especially); just beneath the surface in many of our homes, churches, and communities is abuse enough to freeze the
blood. Moreover, many forms of systemic violence often slip past our attention because they are so much a part of the infrastructure of life (e.g., racism, sexism, ageism).&lt;ref name=Fretheim&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Word &amp; World |first=Terence |last=Freitheim |title=God and Violence in the Old Testament |volume=24 |issue=1 |date=Winter 2004 |url=http://www2.luthersem.edu/word&amp;world/Archives/24-1_Violence/24-1_Fretheim.pdf|accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationships between religion and violence==

Charles Selengut characterizes the phrase "religion and violence" as "jarring," asserting that "religion is thought to be opposed to violence and a force for peace and reconciliation. He acknowledges, however, that "the history and scriptures of the world's religions tell stories of violence and war even as they speak of peace and love."&lt;ref name=Selengut&gt;{{cite book |title=Sacred fury: understanding religious violence |first=Charles |last=Selengut|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mOqtEkGlq0cC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=%22sectarian+violence%22+%22religious+violence%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sectarian%20violence%22%20%22religious%20violence%22&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-7425-6084-0 |date=2008-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Matthew Rowley, three hundred contributing causes of religious violence have been discussed by some scholars, however he notes that "violence in the name of God is a complex phenomenon and oversimplification further jeopardizes peace because it obscures many of the causal factors."&lt;ref name=Rowley1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rowley|first1=Matthew|title=What Causes Religious Violence?|journal=Journal of Religion and Violence|date=2014|volume=2|issue=3|pages=361–402|doi=10.5840/jrv20153234}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another piece, Matthew Rowley notes 15 ways to address the complexity of violence, both secular and religious, and notes that secular narratives of religious violence tend to be erroneous or exaggerated due to over simplification of religious people, their beliefs, thinking in false dichotomies, and ignoring complex secular causes of supposed "religious violence". He also notes that when discussing religious violence, one should also note that the overwhelming majority of religious people do not get inspired to engage in violence.&lt;ref name=Rowley2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rowley|first1=Matthew|title=How Should We Respond to Religious Violence?

Ralph Tanner similarly describes the combination of religion and violence as "uncomfortable", asserting that religious thinkers generally avoid the conjunction of the two and argue that religious violence is "only valid in certain circumstances which are invariably one-sided".&lt;ref name=Tanner2007&gt;{{cite book|title=Violence and religion: cross-cultural opinions and consequences|first= Ralph E.

Michael Jerryson argues that scholarship on religion and violence sometimes overlook non-Abrahamic religions. This tendency provides considerable problems, one of which is the support of faulty associations. For example, he finds a persistent global pattern to align religious like Islam as a cause for violence and others like Buddhism as an explanation of peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jerryson|first=Michael|date=2015-05-06|title=Buddhists and Violence: Historical Continuity/Academic Incongruity|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1111/rec3.12152/full|journal=Religion Compass|volume=9|issue=5|pages=141–150, 141|doi=10.1111/rec3.12152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many instances of political violence, religion tends to play a central role. This is especially true of [[terrorism]], which sees violence committed against unarmed noncombatants in order to inspire fear and achieve some political goal. Terrorism expert [[Martha Crenshaw]] suggests that religion is just a mask used by political movements to draw support. Crenshaw outlines two approaches in observing religious violence to view the underlying mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crenshaw|first=Martha|date=1987-12-01|title=Theories of terrorism: Instrumental and organizational approaches|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01402398708437313|journal=Journal of Strategic Studies|volume=10|issue=4|pages=13–31|doi=10.1080/01402398708437313|issn=0140-2390}}&lt;/ref&gt; One approach, called the instrumental approach, sees religious violence as acting as a rational calculation to achieve some political end. Increasing the costs of performing such violence will help curb it. Crenshaw’s alternate approach sees religious violence stemming from the organizational structure of religious communities, with the heads of these communities acting as political figureheads. Crenshaw suggests that threatening the internal stability of these organizations (perhaps by offering a nonviolent alternative) will dissuade religious organizations from performing political violence. A third approach sees religious violence as a result of community dynamics rather than religious duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mv-jBRlsSlcC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=Terrorism+a+Communitarian+Approach&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=knMnTfXJbo&amp;sig=YZBNEWvwT7EAAkUMjcC2xgK-wp4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwie1ZymlpzUAhWEOCYKHTBGCyYQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Terrorism%20a%20Communitarian%20Approach&amp;f=false|title=Building Terrorism Resistant Communities: Together Against Terrorism|last=Ekici|first=S.|last2=Ekici|first2=A.|date=2009|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=9781607500063|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Symbolic interactionism|Systems of meanings]] developed within these communities allow for religious interpretation to justify violence, and so acts like terrorism happen because people are part of communities of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Terror_in_the_Mind_of_God.html?id=lpb1mbaHjGQC|title=Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence|last=Juergensmeyer|first=Mark|date=2003|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520240117|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, religious violence and terrorism are performances designed to inspire an emotional reaction from both those in the community and those outside of it.

While religion can be used as a means of rallying support for violence, religious leaders regularly denounce such manipulations as contrary to the teachings of their belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pope Benedict apologises for Christian violence through the ages after condemning terrorism in the name of religion |author= Ralph E.S.

[[Hector Avalos]] argues that religions create violence over four scarce resources: access to divine will, knowledge, primarily through scripture; sacred space; group privileging; and salvation. Not all religions have or use these four resources. He believes that religious violence is particularly untenable as these resources are never verifiable and, unlike claims to scare resources such a water or land, cannot be adjudicated objectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fighting Words: The Origins of Religious Violence |first=Hector |last=Avalos|publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, New York|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Regina Schwartz]] argues that all monotheistic religions are inherently violent because of an exclusivism that inevitably fosters violence against those that are considered outsiders.&lt;ref name=ReginaSchwartz&gt;{{cite book |title=The Curse of Cain: The Violent Legacy of Monotheism By Regina M. Schwartz |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lawrence Wechsler asserts that Schwartz isn't just arguing that Abrahamic religions have a violent legacy, but that the legacy is actually genocidal in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wechsler |first=Lawrence |title=Mayhem and Monotheism |url=http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/2490/PDF/mayhem.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720030355/http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/2490/PDF/mayhem.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges to the views that religions are violent ==

===Behavioral studies===

Decades of anthropological, sociological, and psychological research have established that "religious congruence" (the assumption that religious beliefs and values are tightly integrated in an individual's mind or that religious practices and behaviors follow directly from religious beliefs or that religious beliefs are chronologically linear and stable across different contexts) is actually rare. People’s religious ideas are fragmented, loosely connected, and context-dependent, as in all other domains of culture and in life. The beliefs, affiliations, and behaviors of any individual are complex activities that have many sources including culture.&lt;ref name="chaves" /&gt;

===Myth of religious violence===

Others such as William Cavanaugh have argued that it is unreasonable to attempt to differentiate "religious violence" and "secular violence" as separate categories. Cavanaugh asserts that "the idea that religion has a tendency to promote violence is part of the conventional wisdom of Western societies and it underlies many of our institutions and policies, from limits on the public role of churches to efforts to promote liberal democracy in the Middle East." Cavanaugh challenges this conventional wisdom, arguing that there is a "myth of religious violence", basing his argument on the assertion that "attempts to separate religious and secular violence are incoherent".
&lt;ref name="Cavanaugh myth2"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Myth of Religious Violence|first=William|last=Cavanaugh |publisher=Oxford University Press US,|year=2009 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cavanaugh asserts:

* Religion is not a universal and transhistorical phenomenon. What counts as "religious" or "secular" in any context is a function of configurations of power both in the West and lands colonized by the West. The distinctions of "Religious/Secular" and "Religious/Political" are modern Western inventions.
* The invention of the concept of "religious violence" helps the West reinforce superiority of Western social orders to "nonsecular" social orders, namely Muslims at the time of publication.
* The concept of "religious violence" can be and is used to legitimate violence against non-Western "Others".
* Peace depends on a balanced view of violence and recognition that so-called secular ideologies and institutions can be just as prone to absolutism, divisiveness, and irrationality.

John Morreall and Tamara Sonn have argued that all cases of violence and war include social, political, and economic dimensions. Since there is no consensus on definitions of "religion" among scholars and no way to isolate "religion" from the rest of the more likely motivational dimensions, it is incorrect to label any violent event as "religious".&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt; They note that since dozens of examples exist from the [[European wars of religion]] that show that people from the same religions fought each other and that people from different religions became allies during these conflicts, the motivations for these conflicts were not about religion.&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt; Jeffrey Burton Russell has argued that the fact that these wars of religion ended after rulers agreed to practice their religions in their own territories, means that the conflicts were more related to political control than about people's religious views.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey Russell" /&gt;

According to Karen Armstrong, so-called religious conflicts such as the Crusades, Spanish Inquisition, and the European wars of religion, were all deeply political conflicts at the core, not religious ones. Especially since people from different faiths constantly became allies and fought each other in no consistent fashion. She notes that the Western concept of separation of church and state, which was advocated first by the Reformer Martin Luther, laid a foundation for viewing society as divided when in reality religion and society were intermixed to the point that no one made such distinction nor was there a defining cut between such experiences in the past. During the Enlightenment, religion began to be seen as an individualistic and private thing and that modern secular ideals like equality of all human beings, intellectual and political liberty were things that were historically promoted in a religious idiom in the past.&lt;ref name="Armstrong Myth"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Armstrong|first1=Karen|title=The Myth of Religious Violence|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/-sp-karen-armstrong-religious-violence-myth-secular|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|date=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;          

Anthropologist Jack David Eller asserts that religion is not inherently violent, arguing "religion and violence are clearly compatible, but they are not identical." He asserts that "violence is neither essential to nor exclusive to religion" and that " virtually every form of religious violence has its nonreligious corollary."&lt;ref name="CruelCreeds1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eller|first=Jack David|title=Cruel Creeds, Virtuous Violence: Religious Violence Across Culture and History|year=2010|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1-61614-218-6 |quote=As we have insisted previously, religion is not inherently and irredeemably violent; it certainly is not the essence and source of all violence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CruelCreeds2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eller|first=Jack David|title=Cruel Creeds, Virtuous Violence: Religious Violence Across Culture and History|year=2010|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1-61614-218-6 |quote=Religion and violence are clearly compatible, but they are not identical. Violence is one phenomenon in human (and natural existence), religion is another, and it is inevitable that the two would become intertwined. Religion is complex and modular, and violence is one of the modules—not universal, but recurring. As a conceptual and behavioral module, violence is by no means exclusive to religion. There are plenty of other groups, institutions, interests, and ideologies to promote violence. Violence is, therefore, neither essential to nor exclusive to religion. Nor is religious violence all alike... And virtually every form of religious violence has its nonreligious corollary.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he argues that religion "may be more a marker of the [conflicting] groups than an actual point of contention between them".&lt;ref name="Anthropology of Religion"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eller|first=Jack David|title=Introducing Anthropology of Religion|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-40896-7|quote=When a pure or hybrid religious group and/or its interests are threatened, or merely blocked from achieving its interests by another group, conflict and violence may ensue. In such cases, although religion is part of the issue and religious groups form the competitors, or combatants, it would be simplistic or wrong to assume the religion is the "cause" of the trouble or that the parties are "fighting about religion". Religion in the circumstances may be more a marker of the groups than an actual point of contention between them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
John Teehan takes a position that integrates the two opposing sides of this debate. He describes the traditional response in defense of religion as "draw(ing) a distinction between the religion and what is done in the name of that religion or its faithful." Teehan argues, "this approach to religious violence may be understandable but it is ultimately untenable and prevents us from gaining any useful insight into either religion or religious violence." He takes the position that "violence done in the name of religion is not a perversion of religious belief... but flows naturally from the moral logic inherent in many religious systems, particularly monotheistic religions...." However, Teehan acknowledges that "religions are also powerful sources of morality." He asserts, "religious morality and religious violence both spring from the same source, and this is the evolutionary psychology underlying religious ethics."&lt;ref name=Teehan&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Teehan |title=In the Name of God: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Ethics and Violence |publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2010 |pages=145–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians such as [[Jonathan Kirsch]] have made links between the European inquisitions, for example, and Stalin's persecutions in the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, McCarthy blacklists, and other secular events as being the same type of phenomenon as the inquisitions.&lt;ref name="Grand Inquisitor's Manual"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirsch|first=Jonathan|title=The Grand Inquisitor's Manual: A History of Terror in the Name of God|year=2009|publisher=HarperOne|isbn=978-0-06-173276-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as [[Robert Pape]], a political scientist who specializes in suicide terrorism, have made a case for secular motivations and reasons as being foundations of most suicide attacks that are oftentimes labeled as "religious".&lt;ref name="Dying to Win"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pape|first=Robert|title=Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism|year=2005|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-8129-7338-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pape compiled the first complete database of every documented suicide bombing during 1980–2003. He argues that the news reports about [[suicide attack]]s are profoundly misleading &amp;mdash; "There is little connection between [[suicide terrorism]] and [[Islamic fundamentalism]], or any one of the world's religions". After studying 315 suicide attacks carried out over the last two decades, he concludes that suicide bombers' actions stem fundamentally from political conflict, not religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pape|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secularism as a response==

Byron Bland asserts that one of the most prominent reasons for the "rise of the secular in Western thought" was the reaction against the religious violence of the 16th and 17th centuries. He asserts that "(t)he secular was a way of living with the religious differences that had produced so much horror. Under secularity, political entities have a warrant to make decisions independent from the need to enforce particular versions of religious orthodoxy. Indeed, they may run counter to certain strongly held beliefs if made in the interest of common welfare. Thus, one of the important goals of the secular is to limit violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Byron |last=Bland |title=Evil Enemies: The Convergence of Religion and Politics |url=http://www.law.stanford.edu/program/centers/scicn/papers/religion_and_political_violence.pdf |date=May 2003 |page=4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202011617/http://www.law.stanford.edu/program/centers/scicn/papers/religion_and_political_violence.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William T. Cavanaugh]] writes that what he calls "the myth of religious violence" as a reason for the rise of secular states may be traced to earlier philosophers, such as Spinoza, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and Voltaire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/historically_speaking/summary/v012/12.2.yerxa.html Interview with William Cavanaugh]&lt;/ref&gt; Cavanaugh delivers a detailed critique of this idea in his 2009 book ''The Myth of Religious Violence: Secular Ideology and the Roots of Modern Conflict''.

==Secular violence==

===Religion and secular===

According to John Carlson, excessive attention is often paid to acts of religious violence compared to acts of secular violence that do occur. This leads to a false essetializing of both religion as being prone to violence and the secular as being prone to peace, despite the abundant examples of secular violence that have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carlson |first1=John |editor1-last=Murphy |editor1-first=Andrew |title=The Blackwell Companion to Religion and Violence |date=2011 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=1405191317 |page=12 |chapter=1.

[[Hector Avalos]] argues that, because religions claim divine favor for themselves, over and against other groups, this sense of righteousness leads to violence because conflicting claims to superiority, based on unverifiable appeals to God, cannot be adjudicated objectively.&lt;ref name=FightingWords /&gt;

Similarly, Eric Hickey writes, "the history of religious violence in the West is as long as the historical record of its three major religions, [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]], with their involved mutual antagonisms and their struggles to adapt and survive the secular forces that threaten their continued existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of murder and violent crime |first=Eric W. |last=Hickey |publisher=SAGE |year=2003 |page=217 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dDOW75aJMR8C&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=Judaism+Christianity+Islam+%22religious+violence%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Judaism%20Christianity%20Islam%20%22religious%20violence%22&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-7619-2437-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Regina Schwartz]] argues that all [[Monotheism|monotheistic religions]], including Christianity, are inherently violent because of an exclusivism that inevitably fosters violence against those who are considered outsiders.&lt;ref name=ReginaSchwartz /&gt; Lawrence Wechsler asserts that Schwartz isn't just arguing that Abrahamic religions have a violent legacy, but that the legacy is actually genocidal in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wechsler|first=Lawrence|title=Mayhem and Monotheism|url=http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/2490/PDF/mayhem.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720030355/http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/2490/PDF/mayhem.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruce Feiler]] writes that "Jews and Christians who smugly console themselves by claiming that Islam is the only violent religion are willfully ignoring their past. Nowhere is the struggle between faith and violence described more vividly, and with more stomach-turning details of ruthlessness, than in the [[Hebrew Bible]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Where God was born: a journey by land to the roots of religion |first=Bruce S. |last=Feiler |publisher=HarperCollins|year=2005 |page=4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aBVoWhUs-HoC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=Judaism+%22violent+religion%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9780060574871 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Tom O'Golo declares that religious [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalists]] who use violence to further their cause contravene the root truth of all faiths:
{{quote|A genuine fundamentalist is also a radical, someone who tries to get the root of the matter. A major weakness of many or perhaps of most radicals is not that they don't dig, but that they don't dig deep enough. Consequently many fundamentalists end up defending or acting upon beliefs which are not really at the heart of their doctrine. For example any religious fundamentalist who harms others in the pursuit of his or her radicalism is strictly out of order because no true religion ever encounters anything but love, tolerance and understanding. 'Thou shalt not kill' is at the heart of all genuine faiths, certainly the three based upon [[Abraham]] and [[God]]. That trio comprehensively condemns intentional harm to others (and to the self as well) for what ever reason. Dying to protect one's faith is acceptable; killing to promote it isn't. Arguably, it is blasphemous to say that God needs an earthly army to fight Its battles, or perform Its revenge. God is quite capable of fighting His own battles.&lt;ref name=Golo&gt;{{cite book|title=Christ? No! Jesus?

Before the 11th century, Christians had not developed a doctrine of "Holy war", whereby fighting itself might be considered a penitential and spiritually meritorious act.&lt;ref name="Peters First"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peters|first1=Edward|title=The First Crusade: The Chronicle of Fulcher of Chartres and Other Source Materials|date=1998|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=0812216563|edition=2|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duffey Christianity" /&gt; Throughout the Middle Ages, force could not be used to propagate religion.&lt;ref name="James Just War"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=James|editor1-last=Murphy|editor1-first=Andrew R.|title=The Blackwell Companion to Religion and Violence|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=1405191317|chapter=21.

Christianity: From Peacemaking to Violence to Home Again}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century, [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] developed a "Just War" concept, whereby limited uses of war would be considered acceptable in order to preserve the peace and retain orthodoxy if it was waged: for defensive purposes, ordered by an authority, had honorable intentions, and produced minimal harm. However, the criteria he used was already developed by Roman thinkers in the past and "Augustine's perspective was not based on the [[New Testament]]."&lt;ref name="Duffey Christianity" /&gt; St. Augustine's "Just War" concept was widely accepted, however, warfare was not regarded as virtuous in any way.&lt;ref name="Peters First" /&gt; Expression of concern for the salvation of those who killed enemies in battle, regardless of the cause for which they fought, was common.&lt;ref name="Peters First" /&gt; In the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]] which began after the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of Rome]], there were increases in the level of violence due to political instability. By the 11th century, the Church condemned this violence and warring by introducing: the "Peace of God" which prohibited attacks on clergy, pilgrims, townspeople, peasants and property; the "Truce of God" which banned warfare on [[Sunday]]s, [[Friday]]s, [[Lent]], and [[Easter]]; and it imposed heavy penances on soldiers for killing and injuring others because it believed that the shedding of other people's blood was the same as shedding the blood of Christ.&lt;ref name="Duffey Christianity" /&gt;
         
During the 9th and 10th centuries, multiple invasions occurred in some regions in Europe and these invasions lead them to form their own armies in order to defend themselves and by the 11th century, this slowly lead to the emergence of the Crusades, the concept of "holy war", and terminology such as "enemies of God".&lt;ref name="Peters First" /&gt; By the time of the Crusades, "Despite all the violence during this period, the majority of Christians were not active participants but were more often its victims" and groups like the [[Franciscans]] were established which used nonviolent means to peacefully dialogue with Muslims.&lt;ref name="Duffey Christianity" /&gt;

Today the relationship between [[Christianity and violence]] is the subject of controversy because one view advocates the belief that Christianity advocates peace, love and compassion while it has also resorted to violence in certain instances.&lt;ref name=ReginaSchwartz/&gt;&lt;ref name=FightingWords&gt;{{cite book |title=Fighting Words: The Origins of Religious Violence |first=Hector |last=Avalos |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, New York |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VolfChristianityAndViolence&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CKaCWCDIKWsC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22Christianity+and+violence%22+-inpublisher:icon&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Christianity%20and%20violence%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon|chapter=Christianity and Violence|first=Miroslav|last=Volf|authorlink=Miroslav Volf|title=War in the Bible and terrorism in the twenty-first century |editor1-first=Richard S.|editor1-last=Hess|editor2-first=E.A.|editor2-last=Martens|publisher=Eisenbrauns|year=2008|isbn=978-1-57506-803-9|pages=1&amp;ndash;17|accessdate=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peace, compassion and forgiveness of wrongs done by others are key elements of Christian teaching. However, Christians have struggled since the days of the [[Church fathers]] with the question of when the use of force is justified (e.g. the [[Just war theory]] of Saint Augustine). Such debates have led to concepts such as just war theory. Throughout history, certain teachings from the [[Old Testament]], the [[New Testament]] and [[Christian theology]] have been used to justify the use of force against [[heretics]], [[sinners]] and external enemies. Heitman and Hagan identify the [[Inquisitions]], [[Crusades]], wars of religion, and [[antisemitism]] as being "among the most notorious examples of Christian violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International encyclopedia of violence research, Volume 2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=sMNbcU7UnywC&amp;pg=PA323&amp;dq=Christianity+antisemitism+%22violent+religion%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Springer|year=2003|isbn=9781402014666}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this list, [[Mennonite]] theologian J. Denny Weaver adds "warrior popes, support of [[capital punishment]], [[corporal punishment]] under the guise of 'spare the rod spoil the child,' [[Christianity and slavery|justifications of slavery]], world-wide [[colonialism]] under the guise of converting people to Christianity, the systemic violence against women who are subjected to the rule of men".{{Synthesis inline|date=May 2011}} Weaver employs a broader definition of violence that extends the meaning of the word to cover "harm or damage", not just physical violence per se. Thus, under his definition, Christian violence includes "forms of systemic violence such as [[poverty]], [[racism]], and [[sexism]]".&lt;ref name=Weaver&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crosscurrents.org/weaver0701.htm#TEXT1|title=Violence in Christian Theology|accessdate=2010-10-27|publisher=Cross Currents|year=2001|author=J. Denny Weaver |quote=I am using broad definitions of the terms "violence" and "nonviolence". "Violence" means harm or damage, which obviously includes the direct violence of killing -- in war, capital punishment, murder --but also covers the range of forms of systemic violence such as poverty, racism, and sexism. "Nonviolence" also covers a spectrum of attitudes and actions, from the classic Mennonite idea of passive nonresistance through active nonviolence and nonviolent resistance that would include various kinds of social action, confrontations and the posing of alternatives that do not cause bodily harm or injury.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian theologians point to a strong [[doctrinal]] and historical imperative against violence that exists within Christianity, particularly [[Jesus]]' [[Sermon on the Mount]], which taught nonviolence and "love of enemies". For example, Weaver asserts that Jesus' pacifism was "preserved in the justifiable war doctrine which declares that all war is sin even when it is occasionally declared to be a necessary evil, and in the prohibition of fighting by monastics and clergy as well as in a persistent tradition of [[Christian pacifism]]".&lt;ref name=Weaver2&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crosscurrents.org/weaver0701.htm#TEXT1|title=Violence in Christian Theology|accessdate=2010-10-27|publisher=Cross Currents|year=2001|author=J.

Many authors highlight the ironical contradiction between Christianity's claims to be centered on "love and peace" while, at the same time, harboring a "violent side". For example, [[Mark Juergensmeyer]] argues: "that despite its central tenets of love and peace, Christianity&amp;mdash;like most traditions&amp;mdash;has always had a violent side. The bloody history of the tradition has provided images as disturbing as those provided by [[Islam]] or [[Sikhism]], and violent conflict is vividly portrayed in the Bible. This history and these biblical images have provided the raw material for theologically justifying the violence of contemporary Christian groups. For example, attacks on abortion clinics have been viewed not only as assaults on a practice that Christians regard as immoral, but also as skirmishes in a grand confrontation between forces of evil and good that has social and political implications.",&lt;ref name="mind"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence|author=Mark Juergensmeyer|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-24011-1|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|19–20}} sometimes referred to as [[spiritual warfare]]. The statement attributed to Jesus "I come not to bring peace, [[but to bring a sword]]" has been interpreted by some as a call to arms to Christians.&lt;ref name="mind"/&gt;

[[Maurice Bloch]] also argues that Christian faith fosters violence because Christian faith is a religion, and religions are by their very nature violent; moreover, he argues that religion and politics are two sides of the same coin&amp;mdash;power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bloch |first=Maurice|year=1992 |title=Prey into Hunter. The Politics of Religious Experience. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that religion and the exercise of force are deeply intertwined, but that religion may pacify, as well as channel and heighten violent impulses &lt;ref&gt;Andrew McKinnon.

[[File:ForwardwithGod.jpg|thumb|right|''Forward with God!'' (1915) by [[Boardman Robinson]].]]
In response to criticism that Christianity and violence are intertwined, Christian apologists such as Miroslav Volf and J. Denny Weaver reject charges that Christianity is a violent religion, arguing that certain aspects of Christianity might be misused to support violence but that a genuine interpretation of its core elements would not sanction human violence but would instead resist it. Among the examples that are commonly used to argue that Christianity is a violent religion, J. Denny Weaver lists "(the) crusades, the multiple blessings of wars, warrior popes, support for capital punishment, corporal punishment under the guise of 'spare the rod and spoil the child,' justifications of slavery, world-wide colonialism in the name of conversion to Christianity, the systemic violence of women subjected to men". Weaver characterizes the counter-argument as focusing on "Jesus, the beginning point of Christian faith,... whose Sermon on the Mount taught nonviolence and love of enemies,; who faced his accusers nonviolent death;whose nonviolent teaching inspired the first centuries of pacifist Christian history and was subsequently preserved in the justifiable war doctrine that declares all war as sin even when declaring it occasionally a necessary evil, and in the prohibition of fighting by monastics and clergy as well as in a persistent tradition of Christian pacifism."&lt;ref name=Weaver /&gt;

[[Miroslav Volf]] acknowledges that "many contemporaries see religion as a pernicious social ill that needs aggressive treatment rather than a medicine from which cure is expected." However, Volf contests this claim that "(the) Christian faith, as one of the major world religions, predominantly fosters violence." Instead of this negative assessment, Volf argues that Christianity "should be seen as a contributor to more peaceful social environments".&lt;ref name=BoardmanLecture&gt;{{cite web |url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=boardman|title=Christianity and Violence |first=Miroslav |last=Volf |year=2002 |accessdate=2010-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volf examines the question of whether Christianity fosters violence, and has identified four main arguments that it does: that religion by its nature is violent, which occurs when people try to act as "soldiers of God"; that monotheism entails violence, because a claim of universal truth divides people into "us versus them"; that creation, as in the [[Book of Genesis]], is an act of violence; and that the intervention of a "new creation", as in the [[Second Coming of Christ|Second Coming]], generates violence.&lt;ref name=VolfChristianityAndViolence /&gt; Writing about the latter, Volf says: "Beginning at least with Constantine's conversion, the followers of the Crucified have perpetrated gruesome acts of violence under the sign of the cross. Over the centuries, the seasons of Lent and Holy Week were, for the Jews, times of fear and trepidation; Christians have perpetrated some of the worst pogroms as they remembered the crucifixion of Christ, for which they blamed the Jews. Muslims also associate the cross with violence; crusaders' rampages were undertaken under the sign of the cross."&lt;ref name="Volf 2008 13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Volf|2008|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each case, Volf concluded that the Christian faith was misused in justifying violence. Volf argues that "thin" readings of Christianity might be used mischievously to support the use of violence. He counters, however, by asserting that "thick" readings of Christianity's core elements will not sanction human violence and would, in fact, resist it.&lt;ref name=VolfChristianityAndViolence2&gt;{{cite web|first=Miroslav |last=Volf |url=

Volf asserts that Christian churches suffer from a "confusion of loyalties". He asserts that "rather than the character of the Christian faith itself, a better explanation of why Christian churches are either impotent in the face of violent conflicts or actively participate in them derives from the proclivities of its adherents which are at odds with the character of the Christian faith." Volf observes that "(although) explicitly giving ultimate allegiance to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, many Christians in fact seem to have an overriding commitment to their respective cultures and ethnic groups."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Social Meaning of Reconciliation |first=Miroslav |last=Volf|url=http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Volf_The%20Social_June%201998.pdf |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mormonism====
{{Main|Mormonism and violence}}

[[Mormonism]] had an early history of violence. This began with religious persecution on the Mormons by well respected citizens, law enforcement, and government officials. Ultimately such persecution lead to several historically well-known acts of violence. These range from attacks on early Mormons, such as the [[Haun's Mill massacre]] following the [[Missouri Executive Order 44|Mormon Extermination Order]] to one of the most controversial and well-known cases of retaliation violence, the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]]. This was the result of an unprovoked response to religious persecution whereby an innocent party traveling through Mormon occupied territory was attacked on September 11, 1857.

[[Islam]] has been associated with violence in a variety of contexts, especially in the context of [[Jihad]]. In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the word ''jihād'' translates into English as "struggle". Jihad appears in the Qur'an and frequently in the idiomatic expression "striving in the way of [[Allah]] ''(al-jihad fi sabil Allah)''".&lt;ref name="Merriam"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor=[[Wendy Doniger]] | encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions | publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] | year=1999 |isbn=0-87779-044-2}},''Jihad'', p. 571&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MIC"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor=[[Josef W. Meri]] | encyclopedia=Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia |publisher=[[Routledge]] | year=2005 | isbn=0-415-96690-6}}, ''Jihad'', p. 419&lt;/ref&gt; The context of the word can be seen in its usage in Arabic translations of the New Testament such as in 2 Timothy 4:7 where St. Paul expresses keeping the faith after many struggles.&lt;ref name="Omar Islam" /&gt; A person engaged in jihad is called a ''[[mujahid]]''; the plural is [[mujahideen]]. Jihad is an important religious duty for Muslims. A minority among the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni scholars]] sometimes refer to this duty as the sixth [[Five Pillars of Islam|pillar of Islam]], though it occupies no such official status.&lt;ref name="jih"&gt;[[John Esposito]](2005), ''Islam: The Straight Path,'' p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Twelver]] [[Shi'a Islam]], however, Jihad is one of the ten [[Practices of the Religion]].

Hashmi, David Miller, ''Boundaries and Justice: diverse ethical perspectives'', Princeton University Press, p.197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khaleel Muhammad, professor of religious studies at San Diego State University, states, regarding his discussion with the critic Robert Spencer, that "when I am told ... that Jihad only means war, or that I have to accept interpretations of the Quran that non-Muslims (with no good intentions or knowledge of Islam) seek to force upon me, I see a certain agendum developing: one that is based on hate, and I refuse to be part of such an intellectual crime."{{cite web |url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~khaleel/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708102707/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~khaleel/ |archivedate=2008-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tension reached a climax on [[September 11th, 2001]] when Islamic terrorists flew hijacked commercial airplanes into the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in New York City and [[The Pentagon]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The “[[War on Terror]]” has triggered [[Islamophobia|anti-Muslim sentiments]] within [[Christendom]] and throughout the rest of the world. [[Al-Qaeda]] is one of the most well known Islamic extremist groups, created by [[Osama bin Laden|Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden]]. Al-Qaeda's goal is to spread the “purest” form of Islam and [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. Based on his interpretation of the Quran, bin Laden needed to do “good” by inflicting terror upon millions of people. Following the terrorist attacks on September 11, bin Laden praised the suicide bombers in his [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/specials/attacked/transcripts/binladentext_121301.html statement]: ''“the great action you did which was first and foremost by the grace of [[Allah]].

Controversies surrounding the subject include disagreements over whether terrorist acts are self-defense or aggression, national self-determination or Islamic supremacy; whether Islam can ever condone the targeting of non-combatants; whether some attacks described as Islamic terrorism are merely terrorist acts committed by Muslims or terrorist acts motivated by nationalism; whether [[Zionism]] and the [[Arab-Israeli Conflict]] are at the root of Islamic terrorism, or simply one cause of it; how much support for Islamic terrorism exists in the Muslim world&lt;ref&gt;Tony Blair, "Speech to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council", {{cite web |url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page9948.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060815061152/http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page9948.asp |archivedate=2006-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and whether support of terrorism is only a temporary phenomenon, a "bubble", now fading away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Third Bubble |author=Thomas L.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Judaism and violence}}

Burggraeve and Vervenne describe the Old Testament as full of violence and as evidence of both a violent society and a violent god. They write that, "(i)n numerous Old Testament texts the power and glory of Israel's God is described in the language of violence." They assert that more than one thousand passages refer to [[Yahweh|YHWH]] as acting violently or supporting the violence of humans and that more than one hundred passages involve divine commands to kill humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Swords into plowshares: theological reflections on peace |first1=Roger |last1=Burggraeve|first2=Marc |last2=Vervenne |publisher=Peeters Publishers |year=1991 |pages=82,109 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=q8KvY0W58eYC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=%22violent+God%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22violent%20God%22&amp;f=false|isbn=9789068313727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of these passages in the [[Old Testament]], some Christian churches and theologians argue that Judaism is a violent religion and that the god of Israel is a violent god. Reuven Firestone asserts that these assertions are usually made in the context of claims that Christianity is a religion of peace and that the god of Christianity is one who only expresses love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Beyond violence: religious sources of social transformation in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam |editor=Heft, James |publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rxiINuHNAIUC&amp;pg=PT96&amp;dq=Judaism+%22violent+religion%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Judaism%20%22violent%20religion%22&amp;f=false|isbn=9780823223350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars such as Deborah Weissman readily acknowledge that "normative Judaism is not pacifist" and that "violence is condoned in the service of self-defense."However, the Talmud prohibits violence of any kind towards one's neighbour. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Co-existence of Violence and Non-Violence in Judaism|url=http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/what/interreligious/cd39-07.html |accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; J. Patout Burns asserts that, although Judaism condones the use of violence in certain cases, Jewish tradition clearly posits the principle of minimization of violence. This principle can be stated as "(wherever) Jewish law allows violence to keep an evil from occurring, it mandates that the minimal amount of violence must be used in order to accomplish one's goal." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=War and its discontents: pacifism and quietism in the Abrahamic traditions |first=J. Patout |last=Burns|publisher=Georgetown University Press |year=1996 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The love of peace and the pursuit of peace, as well as laws requiring the eradication of evil, sometimes using violent means, co-exist in the Jewish tradition.&lt;ref name="Broyde"&gt;Fighting the War and the Peace: Battlefield Ethics, Peace Talks, Treaties, and Pacifism in the Jewish Tradition.

&lt;/ref&gt; because the [[Torah]] states that the Israelites annihilated entire ethnic groups or tribes: the Israelites killed all Amalekites, including men, women, and children ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+15%3A1-20&amp;version=NIV 1 Samuel 15:1–20]); the Israelites killed all men, women, and children in [[The Battle of Jericho|the battle of Jericho]]([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=joshua+6%3A15-21&amp;version=NIV Joshua 6:15–21]), and the Israelites killed all men, women and children of several Canaanite tribes ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=joshua+10%3A28-42&amp;version=NIV Joshua 10:28–42]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Handbook of Genocide Studies'',  Donald Bloxham, A. Dirk Moses, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scholars{{Who|date=May 2015}} believe that these accounts in the Torah are exaggerated or metaphorical.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[Zionism|Zionist]] leaders sometimes used religious references as a justification for the violent treatment of [[Arabs]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;
Saleh Abdel Jawad (2007) "Zionist Massacres: the Creation of the Palestinian Refugee Problem in the 1948 War" in ''Israel and the Palestinian refugees'', Eyal Benvenistî, Chaim Gans, Sari Hanafi (Eds.), Springer, p. 78:
:".. the Zionist movement, which claims to be secular, found it necessary to embrace the idea of 'the promised land' of Old Testament prophecy, to justify the confiscation of land and the expulsion of the [[Palestinians]]. For example, the speeches and letters of [[Chaim Weizman]], the secular Zionist leader, are filled with references to the biblical origins of the Jewish claim to Palestine, which he often mixes liberally with more pragmatic and nationalistic claims. By the use of this premise, embraced in 1937, Zionists alleged that the Palestinians were usurpers in the Promised Land, and therefore their expulsion and death was justified. The Jewish-American writer Dan Kurzman, in his book ''Genesis 1948'' ... describes the view of one of the Deir Yassin's killers: 'The Sternists followed the instructions of the Bible more rigidly than others. They honored the passage (Exodus 22:2): 'If a thief be found ...' This meant, of course, that killing a thief was not really murder. And were not the enemies of Zionism thieves, who wanted to steal from the Jews what God had granted them?' ''

&lt;/ref&gt; On several occasions, Palestinians have been associated with Biblical antagonists, the Amalekites. For example, [[Rabbi]] [[Israel Hess]] has recommended that Palestinians be killed, based on biblical verses such as 1 Samuel 15.&lt;ref&gt;

"Frequently Jewish fundamentalists refer to the Palestinians as the 'Amalekites' ... of today.... According to the Old Testament, the Amalek ... were regarded as the Israelites' inveterate foe, whose 'annihilation' became a sacred duty and against whom war should be waged until their 'memory be blotted out' forever (Ex 17:16; Deut 25:17–19).... Some of the [modern] political messianics insist on giving the biblical commandment to 'blot out the memory of the Amalek' an actual contemporary relevance in the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians. In February 1980, Rabbi [[Israel Hess]] ... published an article [titled] 'The Genocide Commandment in the Torah' ... which ends with the following: 'The day is not far when we shall all be called to this holy war, this commandment of the annihilation of the Amalek'. Hess quotes the biblical commandment ... 'Do not spare him, but kill man and woman, baby and suckling, ox and sheep, camel, and donkey'.... In his book ''On the Lord's Side'' Danny Rubinstein has shown that this notion permeates the [[Gush Emunim]] movement's bulletins [one of which] carried an article ... which reads 'In every generation there is an Amalek.... The Amalekism of our generation finds expression in the deep Arab hatred towards our national revival ...'... Professor Uriel Tal ... conducted his study in the early 1980s ... and pointed out that the totalitarian political messianic stream refers to the Palestinian Arabs in three stages or degrees: ... [stage] (3) the implementation of the commandment of Amalek, as expressed in Rabbi Hess's article 'The Commandment of Genocide in the Torah', in other words 'annihilating' the Palestinian Arabs'"}}

{{Main|Religious war}}

It has been noted that "religious" conflicts are not exclusively based on religious beliefs but should instead be seen as clashes of communities, identities, and interests that are secular-religious or at least very secular.&lt;ref name="Anthropology of Religion" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Irrational Atheist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dying to Win" /&gt;

Some have asserted that attacks are carried out by those with very strong religious convictions such as terrorists in the context of global religious war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/11-24-2002-30919.asp Full text: bin Laden's 'letter to America'] accessed may 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Pape, a political scientist who specializes in [[suicide terrorism]] argues that much of the modern Muslim suicide terrorism is secularly based.&lt;ref name="Dying to Win" /&gt; Although the causes of terrorism are complex, it may be safe to assume that terrorists are partially reassured by the religious views that God is on their side and that He will reward them in [[Heaven]] for punishing unbelievers.&lt;ref name=juerg /&gt;&lt;ref name=chrjhd&gt;[http://www.cbn.com/spirituallife/ChurchAndMinistry/ChurchHistory/Crusades_CanerChristianJihad0505.asp Christian Jihad: The Crusades and Killing in the Name of Christ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709000007/http://www.cbn.com/spirituallife/ChurchAndMinistry/ChurchHistory/Crusades_CanerChristianJihad0505.asp |date=2008-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ritual violence==
{{Further|ritual slaughter|human sacrifice|animal sacrifice}}
Ritual violence may be directed against victims (e.g., [[human]] and nonhuman [[animal sacrifice]] and [[ritual slaughter]]) or self-inflicted ([[Self-flagellation#Association with religion|religious self-flagellation]]).

According to the [[hunting hypothesis]], created by [[Walter Burkert]] in ''[[Homo Necans]]'', [[carnivorous]] behavior is considered a form of violence. Burkett suggests that the anthropological phenomenon of [[religion]] grew out of rituals that were connected with [[hunting]] and the associated feelings of guilt over the violence that hunting required.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, Walter. 1983.

{{Ecological economics|People}}
'''Robert Underwood Ayres''' (born June 29, 1932) is an American-born physicist and economist. His career has focused on the application of physical ideas, especially the laws of [[thermodynamics]], to [[economics]]; a long-standing pioneering interest in material flows and transformations ([[industrial ecology]] or [[industrial metabolism]])—a concept which he originated.&lt;ref name=AyresBio2010/&gt; His most recent work challenges the widely held [[Economic growth|economic theory of growth]].

==Career==
Trained as a physicist at the [[University of Chicago]], [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], and [[King's College London]] (PhD in Mathematical Physics), Ayres has dedicated his professional life to advancing the environment, technology and resource end of the [[sustainability]] agenda. His major research interests include technological change, [[environmental economics]], "industrial metabolism" and "eco-restructuring". He has worked at the [[Hudson Institute]] (1962–67), Resources for the Future Inc (1968) and International Research and Technology Corp (1969–76). From 1979 until 1992 he was Professor of Engineering and Public Policy at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, except for two years (and six summers) on leave at the [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]] (IIASA) in Laxenburg Austria. In 1992 he moved to the international business school [[INSEAD]] in Fontainebleau, France as Sandoz (later Novartis) Professor of Environment and Management. Since his formal retirement in 2000 he has been Jubilee Visiting Professor (2000–2001) and king Karl Gustav XVI professor of environmental science (2004–2005) at [[Chalmers Institute of Technology]] Gothenburg (Sweden). He is currently an Institute Scholar at IIASA.

He remains an active researcher. He has written or co-authored 20 books, edited or coedited another dozen books, written or co-authored more than 200 journal articles and book chapters not to mention many unpublished reports, on subjects ranging from environmental effects of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] to theoretical economics. But most of his life-work is [[interdisciplinary]]. He was a pioneer of a new field, sometimes called Industrial Metabolism or [[Industrial Ecology]]. He has contributed to [[futures studies]], [[technological forecasting]], transportation and energy studies, material flow studies (`dematerialization'), environmental technology, [[environmental economics]], thermodynamics and economics, and the theory of [[economic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/faculty/profiles/rayres/ |title=insead - faculty &amp; research - Robert U. Ayres |publisher=Insead.edu |date=2002-01-01 |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here taken from one of his recent papers are two paragraphs that provide a flavor of his recent work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mainstream economics today is based to a large extent on bad ideas. Economic concepts, from foundational issues like markets, supply and demand and “free trade”,  to money and finance, lack any systematic awareness of the physical process of production or the implications of the Laws of Thermodynamics  for those processes. A corollary, almost worthy of being a separate bad idea on its own, is that energy doesn’t matter (much) because the cost share of energy in the economy is so small that it can be ignored e.g. {Denison, 1984 #6184}. The so-called “production functions” used by all schools of economic thought that build growth models omit any necessary role for energy, as if output could be produced by labor and capital alone—or as if energy is merely a form of man-made capital that can be produced (as opposed to extracted) by labor and capital.

The essential truth missing from economic education today is that energy is the stuff of the universe, that all matter is also a form of energy, and that the economic system is essentially a system for extracting, processing and transforming energy as resources into energy embodied in products and services. This is a thermodynamic process, as the Rumanian economist Georgescu-Roegen said half a century ago (Georgescu-Roegen 1971). The economic process is subject to both the first law of thermodynamics (conservation of mass/energy; nothing can be created or destroyed) and the second law of thermodynamics (increasing entropy; all transformation processes are irreversible). The “first law” implies that the notion of “consumption” as applied to products is misleading: material transformation processes unavoidably generate large quantities of material wastes or residuals {Ayres, 1969 #284;{Ayres, 1989 #424}.  Some of those wastes are merely inconvenient but others are harmful or toxic. The second law says that energy becomes less useful (exergy is destroyed) by every action.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is much more to be said along these lines. Key publications reflecting these (and some other) important ideas are given in the bibliography below.

The '''Signorelli parapraxis''' represents the first and best known example of a [[parapraxis]] and its analysis in [[Freud]]'s ''[[The Psychopathology of Everyday Life]]''. The parapraxis centers on a [[Anomic aphasia|word finding]] problem and the production of substitutes. Freud couldn't recall the name ([[Luca Signorelli|Signorelli]]) of the painter of the [[Orvieto]] frescos and produced as substitutes the names of two painters [[Botticelli]] and [[Boltraffio]]. Freud's analysis shows what associative processes had linked Signorelli to Botticelli and Boltraffio. The analysis has been criticised by linguists and others.
 
==Botticelli - Boltraffio - Trafoi==
One important ingredient in Freud's analysis was the North-Italian village [[Trafoi]] where he received the message of the suicide of one of his patients, struggling with sexual problems. Without Trafoi the substitute Boltraffio rhyming to it would be incomprehensible. Freud links Trafoi to the theme 'death and sexuality', a theme preceding the word finding problem in a conversation Freud had during a trip by train through [[Bosnia-Herzegowina]].
 
The second important ingredient in Freud's analysis is the extraction of an Italian word ''signor'' from the forgotten name Signorelli. ''Herr'', the German counterpart of ''Signor'', is then linked to Herzegowina and the word ''Herr'' occurring, as Freud tells us, in the conversation.

Freud denies the relevance of the content of the frescos. Nevertheless, psychoanalysts have pursued their investigations particularly into this direction, finding however no new explanation of the parapraxis. [[Jacques Lacan]] suggested that the parapraxis may be an act of self-forgetting.

==Trafoi in Kraepelin's dream==
The first critique to Freud came from [[Emil Kraepelin]], who in a postscript to his 1906 monograph on [[dream speech|language disturbances in dreams]], relates a dream involving Trafoi. The dream centers around a neologism ''Trafei'', which Kraepelin links to Trafoi. The dream may be seen as an implicit critique on Freud's analysis. Italian ''trofei'' is associated to ''Trafei'' in the same way as Trafoi (cf. van Ooijen, 1996) and clarifies Kraepelin's dream. The meaning of ''trofei'' reads in German ''Siegeszeichen'' (victory-signs) and this German word together with Latin ''signum'' clearly links to Freud's first name (Engels, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;22-24).

==Sebastiano Timpanaro==
In ''The Freudian Slip'' [[Sebastiano Timpanaro]] discusses Freud's  analysis in chapter 6 "Love and Death at Orvieto." (p.&amp;nbsp;63-81). He in fact doubts, that the name Boltraffio would have played a major role during the parapraxis, as he states: "Boltraffio is a ''Schlimbesserung'' [that is a substitute worse than another substitute]" and adds "the correction goes astray because of incapacity to localize the fault."(p.&amp;nbsp;71). He calls Botticelli an "involuntary banalization" and Boltraffio "a semi-conscious disimproved correction."(p.&amp;nbsp;75). As to the Signor-element in Freud's analysis he puts: "The immediate equivalence Signore= Herr is one thing, the extraction of ''signor'' from Signorelli and of ''Her(r)'' from Herzegowina is another."

==Swales' investigation==
[[Peter Swales (historian)|Peter Swales]] (2003) investigated the historical data and states that Freud probably visited an exposition of Italian masters in [[Bergamo]] mid-September 1898, showing paintings of Signorelli, Botticelli and Boltraffio one next to the other. In his view the paintings at the exposition were the source of the substitute names in the parapraxis. Swales dwells largely on the three paintings. The association of the name Boltraffio to the name [[Da Vinci]], another hypothesis formulated by Swales (because Freud might have seen the statue of Boltraffio at the bottom of the Da Vinci monument on ''[[Piazza della Scala]]'' in [[Milan]] some days before his visit to [[Bergamo]]), is not further pursued by Swales. Although Freud visited Trafoi on the 8th of August 1898, Swales doubts whether Freud received a message on the suicide of one of his patients.

==Freud neglected his own observation==
[[File:Luca signorelli, cappella di san brizio, predica e punizione dell'anticristo 01.jpg|thumbnail|300px|Fresco of the Deeds of the Antichrist]]
Freud in his analysis did not use the fact that he remembered very well a picture of the painter in the lower left corner of one of the frescos. The picture, sort of a signature, was thus a third substitute to the forgotten name Signorelli. The "signature"  can be interpreted as a reference to the Latin verb ''signare'' and this word, instead of Freud's ''signore'', then leads to a simple analysis of the Signorelli parapraxis (Engels, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;66-69). There seems to be no more need for the Bosnia-Hercegovina associations (''Bo'' and ''Herr'') Freud himself introduced. In the alternative to Freud's analysis the suicide message in Trafoi remains an important point to understand the parapraxis (this message being a blow to Freud's [[self-esteem]]). The occurrence of the Signorelli parapraxis ''during'' Freud's trip from Ragusa to [[Trebinje]] (in Herzegowina) is not questioned, as was done by Swales. {{fact|date=June 2016}}

'''Sound art''' is an artistic discipline in which [[sound]] is utilised as a primary [[artistic medium|medium]]. Like many genres of [[contemporary art]], sound art may be [[interdisciplinary]] in nature, or be used in [[Cross-genre|hybrid]] forms. Sound art can be considered as being an element of many areas such as [[acoustics]], [[psychoacoustics]], [[electronics]], [[noise music]], audio [[Recording medium|media]], [[Field recording|found or environmental sound]], soundscapes, explorations of the human body, [[sculpture]], [[architecture]], [[film]] or [[video]] and other aspects of the current discourse of contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn. 2001, {{Page needed|date=May 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western art]], early examples include [[Luigi Russolo]]'s ''[[Intonarumori]]'' or noise intoners, and subsequent experiments by [[Dadaists]], [[Surrealists]], the [[Situationist International]], and in [[Fluxus]] [[happenings]]. Because of the diversity of sound art, there is often debate about whether sound art falls within the domains of [[visual art]] or [[experimental music]] categories, or both.&lt;ref&gt;Licht 2007, {{Page needed|date=May 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other artistic lineages from which sound art emerges are [[conceptual art]], [[minimalism]], [[site-specific art]], [[sound poetry]], [[electro-acoustic music]], [[spoken word]], [[avant-garde]] poetry, and [[experimental theatre]].

==Origin of the term in the United States==
The earliest documented use of the term in the U.S. is from a catalogue for a show called "Sound/Art" at The Sculpture Center in New York City, created by William Hellerman in 1983.  The show was sponsored by "The SoundArt Foundation," which Hellerman founded in 1982.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} The artists featured in the show were: [[Vito Acconci]], Connie Beckley, Bill and Mary Buchen, [[Nicolas Collins]], [[Sari Dienes]] and [[Pauline Oliveros]], Richard Dunlap, [[Terry Fox (artist)|Terry Fox]], William Hellermann, Jim Hobart, [[Richard Lerman]], [[Les Levine]], [[Joe Lewis (artist)|Joe Lewis]], Tom Marioni, [[Jim Pomeroy (artist)|Jim Pomeroy]], Alan Scarritt, [[Carolee Schneeman]], Bonnie Sherk, [[Keith Sonnier]], Norman Tuck, [[Hannah Wilke]], Yom Gagatzi. The following is an excerpt from the catalogue essay by art historian Don Goddard: "It may be that sound art adheres to curator Hellermann's perception that "hearing is another form of seeing,' that sound has meaning only when its connection with an image is understood... The conjunction of sound and image insists on the engagement of the viewer, forcing participation in real space and concrete, responsive thought rather than illusionary space and thought."&lt;ref&gt;Hellerman and Goddard 1983, {{Page needed|date=May 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sound art always takes place in an acoustic context, which may influence interpretation as much as if not more than any associated imagery. Installations of sound art rely on the acoustics of the spaces and reproduction technologies employed as can be exemplified by current practitioners such as Chris Watson.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Sound art in Europe==
===Belgium===
The [[Klankenbos]] (Sound forest) of [[Provinciaal Domein Dommelhof]] is the biggest sound art collection in [[public space]] in Europe. In the forest there are 15 [[sound installation]] pieces by artists such as [[Pierre Berthet]], [[Paul Panhuysen]], [[Geert Jan Hobbijn]] ([[Staalplaat]] Soundsystem), [[Hans van Koolwijk]], and others. Yearly in [[Kortrijk]] there is the sound art festival [[Wilde Westen]] (formerly known as Happy New Ears). In [[Brussels]] there are [[QO2]] and [[Overtoon]], two organisations that run [[artist-in-residence]] programs and organize events. [[Logos Foundation]] from [[Ghent]] is a sound art org run by [[Godfried-Willem Raes]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In [[multilinear algebra]], a '''tensor contraction''' is an operation on a [[tensor]] that arises from the [[natural pairing]] of a finite-[[dimension]]al [[vector space]] and its [[dual vector space|dual]]. In components, it is expressed as a sum of products of scalar components of the tensor(s) caused by applying the [[summation convention]] to a pair of dummy indices that are bound to each other in an expression.  The contraction of a single [[mixed tensor]] occurs when a pair of literal indices (one a subscript, the other a superscript) of the tensor are set equal to each other and summed over. In the [[Einstein notation]] this summation is built into the notation. The result is another [[tensor]] with order reduced by 2.

Tensor contraction can be seen as a generalization of the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]].

== Abstract formulation ==
Let ''V'' be a vector space over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k''. The core of the contraction operation, and the simplest case, is the [[natural transformation|natural]] pairing of ''V'' with its dual vector space ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;. The pairing is the [[linear transformation]] from the [[Component-free treatment of tensors#Definition: Tensor Product of Vector Spaces|tensor product]] of these two spaces to the field ''k'':

: &lt;math&gt; C : V^* \otimes V \rightarrow k &lt;/math&gt;

corresponding to the [[bilinear form]]

: &lt;math&gt; \langle f, v \rangle = f(v) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' is in ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; and ''v'' is in ''V''. The map ''C'' defines the contraction operation on a tensor of type {{nowrap|(1, 1)}}, which is an element of &lt;math&gt;V^* \otimes V &lt;/math&gt;. Note that the result is a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] (an element of ''k''). Using the natural isomorphism between &lt;math&gt;V^* \otimes V &lt;/math&gt; and the space of linear transformations from ''V'' to ''V'',&lt;ref name="natural iso"&gt;Let {{nowrap|L(''V'', ''V'')}} be the space of linear transformations from ''V'' to ''V''. Then the natural map

: &lt;math&gt;V^* \otimes V \rightarrow L(V,V) &lt;/math&gt;

is defined by

: &lt;math&gt;f \otimes v \mapsto g ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{nowrap|1=''g''(''w'') = ''f''(''w'')''v''}}. Suppose that ''V'' is finite-dimensional. If {''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;} is a basis of ''V'' and {''f''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;} is the corresponding dual basis, then &lt;math&gt;f^i \otimes v_j&lt;/math&gt; maps to the transformation whose matrix in this basis has only one nonzero entry, a 1 in the ''i'',''j'' position. This shows that the map is an isomorphism.&lt;/ref&gt; one obtains a basis-free definition of the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]].

In general, a [[tensor]] of type {{nowrap|(''m'', ''n'')}} (with {{nowrap|''m'' ≥ 1}} and {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 1}}) is an element of the vector space

: &lt;math&gt;V \otimes \cdots \otimes V \otimes V^{*} \otimes \cdots \otimes V^{*}&lt;/math&gt;

(where there are ''m'' factors ''V'' and ''n'' factors ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="fulton_harris"&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Fulton |authorlink=William Fulton (mathematician) |first2=Joe |last2=Harris |authorlink2=Joe Harris (mathematician) |title=Representation Theory: A First Course |series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics|GTM]] |volume=129 |publisher=Springer |location=New York |year=1991 |isbn=0-387-97495-4 |pages=471–476 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="warner"&gt;{{cite book |first=Frank |last=Warner |title=Foundations of Differentiable Manifolds and Lie Groups |series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics|GTM]] |volume=94 |publisher=Springer |location=New York |year=1993 |isbn=0-387-90894-3 |pages=54–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Applying the natural pairing to the ''k''th ''V'' factor and the ''l''th ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; factor, and using the identity on all other factors, defines the (''k'', ''l'') contraction operation, which is a linear map which yields a tensor of type {{nowrap|(''m'' − 1, ''n'' − 1)}}.&lt;ref name="fulton_harris"/&gt; By analogy with the {{nowrap|(1, 1)}} case, the general contraction operation is sometimes called the trace.

== Contraction in index notation ==

In [[tensor index notation]], the basic contraction of a vector and a dual vector is denoted by

: &lt;math&gt; \tilde f (\vec v) = f_\gamma v^\gamma &lt;/math&gt;

which is shorthand for the explicit coordinate summation&lt;ref name="physics"&gt;In physics (and sometimes in mathematics), indices often start with zero instead of one. In four-dimensional spacetime, indices run from 0 to 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; f_\gamma v^\gamma = f_1 v^1 + f_2 v^2 + \cdots + f_n v^n &lt;/math&gt;

(where {{math|''v''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are the components of {{math|''v''}} in a particular basis and {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the components of {{math|''f''}} in the corresponding dual basis).

Since a general mixed [[dyadic tensor]] is a linear combination of decomposable tensors of the form &lt;math&gt;f \otimes v&lt;/math&gt;, the explicit formula for the dyadic case follows: let

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T} = T^i{}_j \mathbf{e}_i \otimes \mathbf{e}^j &lt;/math&gt;

be a mixed dyadic tensor. Then its contraction is

: &lt;math&gt; T^i {}_j \mathbf{e}_i \cdot \mathbf{e}^j = T^i {}_j \delta_i {}^j
= T^j{}_j = T^1{}_1 + \cdots + T^n{}_n &lt;/math&gt;.

A general contraction is denoted by labeling one [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] index and one [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] index with the same letter, summation over that index being implied by the [[summation convention]]. The resulting contracted tensor inherits the remaining indices of the original tensor. For example, contracting a tensor ''T'' of type (2,2) on the second and third indices to create a new tensor ''U'' of type (1,1) is written as

: &lt;math&gt; T^{ab} {}_{bc} = \sum_{b}{T^{ab}{}_{bc}} = T^{a1} {}_{1c} + T^{a2} {}_{2c} + \cdots + T^{an} {}_{nc} = U^a {}_c .&lt;/math&gt;

By contrast, let

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T} = \mathbf{e}^i \otimes \mathbf{e}^j &lt;/math&gt;

be an unmixed dyadic tensor. This tensor does not contract; if its base vectors are dotted the result is the contravariant [[metric (mathematics)|metric tensor]],

: &lt;math&gt; g^{ij} = \mathbf{e}^i \cdot \mathbf{e}^j &lt;/math&gt;,

whose rank is 2.

== Metric contraction ==
{{see also|Raising and lowering indices#An example from Minkowski spacetime}}
As in the previous example, contraction on a pair of indices that are either both contravariant or both covariant is not possible in general. However, in the presence of an [[inner product]] (also known as a [[Metric tensor|metric]]) ''g'', such contractions are possible. One uses the metric to raise or lower one of the indices, as needed, and then one uses the usual operation of contraction. The combined operation is known as ''[[metric contraction]]''.&lt;ref name="o'neill"&gt;{{cite book |first=Barrett |last=O'Neill |title=Semi-Riemannian Geometry with Applications to Relativity |location= |publisher=Academic Press |year=1983 |page=86 |isbn=0-12-526740-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application to tensor fields ==

Contraction is often applied to [[tensor fields]] over spaces (e.g. [[Euclidean space]], [[manifold]]s, or [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]]{{fact|date=April 2015}}). Since contraction is a purely algebraic operation, it can be applied pointwise to a tensor field, e.g. if ''T'' is a (1,1) tensor field on Euclidean space, then in any coordinates, its contraction (a scalar field) ''U'' at a point ''x'' is given by

: &lt;math&gt;U(x) = \sum_{i} T^{i}_{i}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Since the role of ''x'' is not complicated here, it is often suppressed, and the notation for tensor fields becomes identical to that for purely algebraic tensors.

Over a [[Riemannian manifold]], a metric (field of inner products) is available, and both metric and non-metric contractions are crucial to the theory. For example, the [[Ricci tensor]] is a non-metric contraction of the [[Riemann curvature tensor]], and the [[scalar curvature]] is the unique metric contraction of the Ricci tensor.

One can also view contraction of a tensor field in the context of modules over an appropriate ring of functions on the manifold&lt;ref name="o'neill"/&gt; or the context of sheaves of modules over the structure sheaf;&lt;ref name="hartshorne"&gt;{{cite book |first=Robin |last=Hartshorne |authorlink=Robin Hartshorne |title=Algebraic Geometry |location=New York |publisher=Springer |year=1977 |isbn=0-387-90244-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; see the discussion at the end of this article.

=== Tensor divergence ===

As an application of the contraction of a tensor field, let ''V'' be a [[vector field]] on a [[Riemannian manifold]] (for example, [[Euclidean space]]). Let &lt;math&gt; V^\alpha {}_{;\beta}&lt;/math&gt; be the [[covariant derivative]] of ''V'' (in some choice of coordinates). In the case of [[Cartesian coordinates]] in Euclidean space, one can write

: &lt;math&gt; V^\alpha {}_{;\beta} = {\partial V^\alpha \over \partial x^\beta}. &lt;/math&gt;

Then changing index β to α causes the pair of indices to become bound to each other, so that the derivative contracts with itself to obtain the following sum:

: &lt;math&gt; V^\alpha {}_{;\alpha} = V^0 {}_{;0} + \cdots + V^n {}_{;n} &lt;/math&gt;

which is the [[divergence]] div ''V''. Then

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{div} V = V^\alpha {}_{;\alpha} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

is a [[continuity equation]] for ''V''.

In general, one can define various divergence operations on higher-rank [[tensor fields]], as follows. If ''T'' is a tensor field with at least one contravariant index, taking the [[covariant differential]] and contracting the chosen contravariant index with the new covariant index corresponding to the differential results in a new tensor of rank one lower than that of ''T''.&lt;ref name="o'neill"/&gt;

== Contraction of a pair of tensors ==

One can generalize the core contraction operation (vector with dual vector) in a slightly different way, by considering a pair of tensors ''T'' and ''U''. The [[tensor product]] &lt;math&gt;T \otimes U&lt;/math&gt; is a new tensor, which, if it has at least one covariant and one contravariant index, can be contracted. The case where ''T'' is a vector and ''U'' is a dual vector is exactly the core operation introduced first in this article.

In tensor index notation, to contract two tensors with each other, one places them side by side (juxtaposed) as factors of the same term. This implements the tensor product, yielding a composite tensor. Contracting two indices in this composite tensor implements the desired contraction of the two tensors.

For example, matrices can be represented as tensors of type (1,1) with the first index being contravariant and the second index being covariant.  Let &lt;math&gt; \Lambda^\alpha {}_\beta &lt;/math&gt; be the components of one  matrix and let &lt;math&gt; \Mu^\beta {}_\gamma &lt;/math&gt; be the components of a second matrix.  Then their multiplication is given by the following contraction, an example of the contraction of a pair of tensors:

: &lt;math&gt; \Lambda^\alpha {}_\beta \Mu^\beta {}_\gamma = \Nu^\alpha {}_\gamma &lt;/math&gt;.

Also, the [[interior product]] of a vector with a [[differential form]] is a special case of the contraction of two tensors with each other.

== More general algebraic contexts ==

Let ''R'' be a [[commutative ring]] and let ''M'' be a finite free [[module (mathematics)|module]] over ''R''. Then contraction operates on the full (mixed) tensor algebra of ''M'' in exactly the same way as it does in the case of vector spaces over a field. (The key fact is that the natural pairing is still perfect in this case.)

More generally, let ''O''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; be a [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] of commutative rings over a [[topological space]] ''X'', e.g. ''O''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; could be the [[structure sheaf]] of a [[complex manifold]], [[analytic space]], or [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]. Let ''M'' be a [[locally free sheaf]] of modules over ''O''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; of finite rank. Then the dual of ''M'' is still well-behaved&lt;ref name="hartshorne"/&gt; and contraction operations make sense in this context.

The '''tetrad test''' is a series of behavioral paradigms in which rodents treated with [[cannabinoids]] such as [[THC]] show effects.&lt;ref&gt;Little, P.J.; Compton, D.R.; Johnson, M.R.; Melvin, L.S.; Martin, B.R. (1988). Pharmacology and stereoselectivity of structurally novel cannabinoids in mice. ''J Pharmacol Exp Ther'' 247: 1046–51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fride, E., A. Perchuk, F. S. Hall, G. R. Uhl, and E. S. Onaivi. 2006. Behavioral methods in cannabinoid research. Pp. 269–290 in E. S. Onaivi, ed. Marijuana and Cannabinoid Research: Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is widely used for screening drugs that induce [[cannabinoid receptor]]-mediated effects in rodents. The four behavioral components of the tetrad are spontaneous activity, catalepsy, hypothermia, and analgesia. Common assays for these behavioral paradigms are as follows:
* Spontaneous activity (or [[hypomotility]]) is determined by an [[Open field (animal test)|open field test]], in which a mouse is placed in a cage with perpendicular grid lines, usually spaced by approx. 1 inch. An experimenter counts the number of line crossings by the mouse in a given amount of time.
* [[Catalepsy]] is determined by the bar test. The mouse is placed on a bar oriented parallel to and approximately 1 inch off of the ground. If the mouse remains immobile on the bar for typically more than 20 seconds, it is considered cataleptic.
* [[Hypothermia]] (reduced body temperature) is determined by using a rectal probe to measure the rectal temperature.
* [[Analgesia]] is usually determined by the [[Hot plate test|hot plate]] or tail immersion test. In the hot plate test, the mouse is placed on a heated plate, typically between 54 and 58°C. An experimenter measures the time it takes for the animal to raise its feet or jump off of the hot plate. In the tail immersion test, the mouse is immobilized and its tail is placed into a warm water bath, typically also between 54 and 58°C. An experimenter measures the time it takes for the mouse to remove its tail from the water bath.

Direct [[cannabinoid receptor 1|CB1]] agonists, such as [[THC]] (the psychoactive component of [[marijuana]]), or [[WIN 55,212-2]], have effects in all components of the tetrad and induce hypomotility, catalepsy, hypothermia, and analgesia in rodents. Accordingly, all true "tetrad effects" are not observed following treatment with [[receptor antagonist|antagonists]] or [[inverse agonist|inverse agonists]] of CB1 such as [[rimonabant]].

The '''revaluation of all values''' or "'''transvaluation'''" is a [[concept]] from the [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|philosophy]] of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].

Elaborating the concept in ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'', Nietzsche asserts that  [[Christianity]], not merely as a religion but also as the predominant moral system of the Western world, inverts nature, and is "hostile to life".  As "the religion of pity", it elevates the weak over the strong, exalting that which is "ill-constituted and weak" at the expense of that which is full of life and vitality.

Nietzsche compares Christianity to [[Buddhism]]. He posits that Christianity is "the struggle against sin", whereas Buddhism is "the struggle against suffering"; to Nietzsche, Christianity limits and lowers humankind by assailing its natural and inevitable instincts as depraved ("[[sin]]"), whereas Buddhism advises one merely to eschew [[dukkha|suffering]]. While Christianity is full of "revengefulness" and "antipathy" (e.g., the [[Last Judgment]]), Buddhism promotes "benevolence, being kind, as health-promoting."  Buddhism is also suggested to be the more "honest" of the two religions, for its being strictly "[[phenomenalism|phenomenalistic]]", and because "Christianity makes a thousand promises but ''keeps none''."  [[Martyrdom]], rather than being a moral high ground or position of strength, is indicative of an "''obtuseness'' to the question of truth."

Similarly, Nietzsche contrasts 19th-century European morality to that of pre-Christian Greek civilization. Because sex is, in Nietzsche's thought, a fundamental affirmation of life, for its being the very process by which human life is created, Christianity's elevation of chastity (including, for example, the story of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]'s virginal pregnancy) is counter to the natural instincts of humanity, and therefore a contradiction of "natural values".{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Nietzsche's enthusiasm for what he called "transvaluation" stemmed from his contempt for Christianity and the entirety of the moral system that flowed from it: indeed, "contempt of man", as Nietzsche states near the end of ''The Antichrist''. Nietzsche perceived the moral framework of Christian civilization to be oppressive:  
* Reproduction derided as sinful
* Life as a mere investment for the hollow promise of an illustrious afterlife
* Death valued over life

Transvaluation would mean the exaltation of life rather than the exaltation of suffering, and an acceptance of every instinct or lust as organic and therefore valid{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}, and so beyond the scope of moral condemnation. What one desires would be merely what one desires, rather than either sinful or pious. What one desires would be the product of stimuli rather than the product of "will".

{{quote|I call Christianity the one great curse, the one great intrinsic depravity, the one great instinct for revenge for which no expedient&amp;nbsp;''(i.e. A means of attaining an end, especially one that is convenient but considered improper or immoral)''&amp;nbsp;is sufficiently poisonous, secret, subterranean, ''petty''&amp;nbsp;—I call it the one immortal blemish of mankind…&lt;br /&gt;

And one calculates time from the ''dies nefastus'' on which this fatality arose—from the ''first'' day of Christianity! ''Why not rather from its last? From today?'' Revaluation of all values!|sign=Nietzsche|source=Conclusion, ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |authorlink=Friedrich Nietzsche |title=The Antichrist |chapter=Conclusion |edition=2005 Cosimo |date=1895 |isbn=978-1-59605-681-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''[[The Revaluation of All Values]]'' was also the working title of a series of four books Nietzsche was planning to write, only the first of which—''The Antichrist''—he ever completed. However, one of his schemas for ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'' used "The Revaluation of All Values" as a subtitle, and it was this scheme that his sister [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] used to assemble his notes into the final book with that title.

In [[philosophy]], a sentence which asserts incomplete truth conditions for a proposition may be regarded as a truism.{{cn|date=June 2017}} An example of such a sentence would be "Under appropriate conditions, the sun rises."  Without contextual support{{spaced ndash}}a statement of what those appropriate conditions are{{spaced ndash}}the sentence is true but incontestable. A statement which is true by definition (for example, the [[Lapalissade]] "If he were not dead, he would still be alive") would also be considered a truism.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

The word may also be used with a different sense in [[rhetoric]], to disguise the fact that a proposition is really just an [[opinion]].{{Example needed}} {{cn|date=June 2017}}

'''Truth''' is most often used to mean being in accord with [[fact]] or [[reality]], or fidelity to an original or standard.&lt;ref name = Merriam-Webster-def&gt;Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary, [http://m-w.com/dictionary/truth truth], 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Truth is also sometimes defined in [[modernity|modern]] contexts as an idea of "truth to self", or [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]].

Truth is usually held to be [[principle of bivalence|opposite]] to [[Falsity|falsehood]], which, correspondingly, can also suggest a logical, factual, or ethical meaning. The [[concept]] of truth is discussed and [[debate]]d in several contexts, including philosophy, art, theology, and science. Most human activities depend upon the concept, where its nature as a concept is assumed rather than being a subject of discussion; these include most of the [[science]]s, [[law]], [[journalism]], and everyday life. Some philosophers view the concept of truth as basic, and unable to be explained in any terms that are more easily understood than the concept of truth itself. To some, truth is viewed as the correspondence of [[language]] or [[thought]] to an independent [[reality]], in what is sometimes called the [[correspondence theory of truth]].

Various theories and views of truth continue to be debated among scholars, philosophers, and theologians.&lt;ref name=PUP32014&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alexis G. Burgess and John P. Burgess|title=Truth|date=March 20, 2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691144016|edition=1st|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9460.html|accessdate=October 4, 2014|format=hardcover|quote=a concise introduction to current philosophical debates about truth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language is a means by which humans convey [[information]] to one another. The method used to determine whether something is a truth is termed a [[criteria of truth|criterion of truth]]. There are varying stances on such questions as what constitutes truth: what things are [[truthbearer]]s capable of being true or false; how to define, identify, and distinguish truth; what roles do faith and empirical knowledge play; and whether truth can be [[Subjectivity|subjective]] or is [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]: [[knowledge relativity|relative]] truth versus [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] truth.

[[File:An angel carrying the banner of "Truth", Roslin, Midlothian.JPG|thumb|left|An angel carrying the banner of "Truth", [[Roslin, Midlothian]]]]
The English word ''[[:wikt:truth|truth]]'' is derived from [[Old English]] ''tríewþ, tréowþ, trýwþ'', [[Middle English]] ''trewþe'', cognate to [[Old High German]] ''triuwida'', [[Old Norse]] ''tryggð''. Like ''[[Troth (disambiguation)|troth]]'', it is a ''[[:wikt:-th|-th]]'' nominalisation of the adjective ''true'' (Old English ''tréowe'').

The English word ''[[:wikt:true|true]]'' is from Old English ([[West Sexaon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]]) ''(ge)tríewe, [[:wikt:treowe|tréowe]]'', cognate to [[Old Saxon]] ''(gi)trûui'', [[Old High German]] ''(ga)triuwu'' ([[Modern German]] ''treu'' "faithful"), [[Old Norse]] ''tryggr'', [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''triggws'',&lt;ref&gt;see [[Holtzmann's law]] for the ''-ww-'' : ''-gg-'' alternation.&lt;/ref&gt; all from a [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*trewwj-'' "having [[good faith]]", perhaps ultimately from PIE *dru- "tree", on the notion of "steadfast as an oak" (e.g., Sanskrit "taru" tree).&lt;ref name="Truth from Online Etymology"&gt;{{cite web|last=Etymology|first=Online|title=Online Etymology|url=http://www.etymonline.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Old Norse ''{{lang|is|trú}}'', "faith, word of honour; religious faith, belief"&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.northvegr.org/zoega/h442.php A Concise Dictionary of Old Icelandic]'', Geir T. Zoëga (1910), Northvegr.org&lt;/ref&gt; (archaic English ''[[:wikt:troth|troth]]'' "loyalty, honesty, good faith", compare ''{{lang|is|[[wikt:Ásatrú|Ásatrú]]}}'').

Thus, 'truth' involves both the quality of "faithfulness, fidelity, loyalty, sincerity, veracity",&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] on ''true'' has "Steadfast in adherence to a commander or friend, to a principle or cause, to one's promises, faith, etc.; firm in allegiance; faithful, loyal, constant, trusty; Honest, honourable, upright, virtuous, trustworthy; free from deceit, sincere, truthful " besides "Conformity with fact; agreement with reality; accuracy, correctness, verity; Consistent with fact; agreeing with the reality; representing the thing as it is; Real, genuine; rightly answering to the description; properly so called; not counterfeit, spurious, or imaginary."&lt;/ref&gt; and that of "agreement with [[fact]] or [[reality]]", in Anglo-Saxon expressed by ''[[:wikt:sōþ|sōþ]]'' (Modern English ''[[:wikt:sooth|sooth]]'').

All Germanic languages besides English have introduced a terminological distinction between truth "fidelity" and truth "factuality". To express "factuality", [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] opted for nouns derived from ''sanna'' "to assert, affirm", while continental [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] (German and Dutch) opted for continuations of ''wâra'' "faith, trust, pact" (cognate to Slavic ''věra'' "(religious) faith", but influenced by Latin ''[[veritas|verus]]''). [[Romance language]]s use terms following the Latin ''[[veritas]]'', while the Greek ''[[aletheia]]'', Russian ''[[:wikt:pravda|pravda]]'' and South Slavic ''istina'' have separate etymological origins.

The question of what is a proper basis for deciding how words, symbols, ideas and beliefs may properly be considered true, whether by a single person or an entire society, is dealt with by the five most prevalent substantive theories of truth listed below. Each presents perspectives that are widely shared by published scholars.&lt;ref name="EPT"&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Supp., "Truth", auth: Michael Williams, pp. 572–73 (Macmillan, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Simon, and Simmons, Keith (eds., 1999), ''Truth'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK. Includes papers by James, Ramsey, Russell, Tarski, and more recent work.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | editor1-last = Hale | editor1-first = Bob| editor2-first = Crispin | doi = 10.1111/b.9780631213260.1999.00015.x | pages = 309–30 | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780631213260 | pmid =  | pmc = | editor2-last = Wright | title = A Companion to the Philosophy of Language}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories other than the most prevalent substantive theories are also discussed. More recently developed "[[deflationary theory of truth|deflationary]]" or "minimalist" theories of truth have emerged as possible alternatives to the most prevalent substantive theories. Minimalist reasoning centres around the notion that the application of a term like ''true'' to a statement does not assert anything significant about it, for instance, anything about its ''nature''. Minimalist reasoning realises ''truth'' as a label utilised in general discourse to express agreement, to stress claims, or to form general assumptions.&lt;ref name = EPT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horwich, Paul, ''Truth'', (2nd edition, 1988),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Field, Hartry, ''Truth and the Absence of Fact'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substantive theories===

====Correspondence theory====
{{Main|Correspondence theory of truth}}
Correspondence theories emphasise that true beliefs and true statements correspond to the actual state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth.: [[Arthur N. Prior]], p. 223 (Macmillan, 1969). Prior uses [[Bertrand Russell]]'s wording in defining correspondence theory. According to Prior, Russell was substantially responsible for helping to make correspondence theory widely known under this name.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of theory stresses a relationship between thoughts or statements on one hand, and things or objects on the other. It is a traditional model tracing its origins to [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosophers such as [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth.: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223–24 (Macmillan, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt; This class of theories holds that the truth or the falsity of a representation is determined in principle entirely by how it relates to "things", by whether it accurately describes those "things." A classic example of correspondence theory is the statement by the thirteenth century philosopher and theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]]: "[[Veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus]]" ("Truth is the adequation of things and [[intellect]]"), which Aquinas attributed to the ninth century [[Neoplatonist]] [[Isaac Israeli ben Solomon|Isaac Israeli]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol. 2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth.: Arthur N. Prior, Macmillan, 1969, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence "Correspondence Theory of Truth", in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''[[Summa Theologiae]]'', I. Q.16, A.2 arg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas also restated the theory as: "A judgment is said to be true when it conforms to the external reality".&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence "Correspondence Theory of Truth", in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] (citing ''De Veritate'' Q.1, A.1–3 and ''[[Summa Theologiae]]'', I. Q.16).&lt;/ref&gt;

Correspondence theory centres heavily around the assumption that truth is a matter of accurately copying what is known as "[[objective reality]]" and then representing it in thoughts, words and other symbols.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' Bradley, F.H., "On Truth and Copying", in Blackburn, ''et al.'' (eds., 1999),''Truth'', 31–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern theorists have stated that this ideal cannot be achieved without analysing additional factors.&lt;ref name=EPT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223 ''ff''. Macmillan, 1969. See especially, section on "Moore's Correspondence Theory", 225–26, "Russell's Correspondence Theory", 226–27, "Remsey and Later Wittgenstein", 228–29, "Tarski's Semantic Theory", 230–31.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, language plays a role in that all languages have words to represent concepts that are virtually undefined in other languages. The [[German language|German]] word ''[[Zeitgeist]]'' is one such example: one who speaks or understands the language may "know" what it means, but any translation of the word apparently fails to accurately capture its full meaning (this is a problem with many abstract words, especially those derived in [[agglutinative languages]]). Thus, some words add an additional parameter to the construction of an accurate [[truth predicate]]. Among the philosophers who grappled with this problem is [[Alfred Tarski]], whose [[semantic theory of truth|semantic theory]] is summarized further below in this article.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223 ''ff''. Macmillan, 1969. See the section on "Tarski's Semantic Theory", 230–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of several of the theories below have gone further to assert that there are yet other issues necessary to the analysis, such as interpersonal power struggles, community interactions, personal biases and other factors involved in deciding what is seen as truth.

====Coherence theory====
{{Main|Coherence theory of truth}}
[[File:Statue of Truth.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walter Seymour Allward]]'s ''Veritas'' (Truth) outside [[Supreme Court of Canada]], [[Ottawa, Ontario]] [[Canada]]]]

For coherence theories in general, truth requires a proper fit of elements within a whole system. Very often, though, coherence is taken to imply something more than simple logical consistency; often there is a demand that the propositions in a coherent system lend mutual inferential support to each other. So, for example, the completeness and comprehensiveness of the underlying set of concepts is a critical factor in judging the validity and usefulness of a coherent system.&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant]], for instance, assembled a controversial but quite coherent system in the early 19th century, whose validity and usefulness continues to be debated even today. Similarly, the systems of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Spinoza]] are characteristic systems that are internally coherent but controversial in terms of their utility and validity.&lt;/ref&gt;  A pervasive tenet of coherence theories is the idea that truth is primarily a property of whole systems of propositions, and can be ascribed to individual propositions only according to their coherence with the whole.  Among the assortment of perspectives commonly regarded as coherence theory, theorists differ on the question of whether coherence entails many possible true systems of thought or only a single absolute system.

Some variants of coherence theory are claimed to describe the essential and intrinsic properties of [[formal system]]s in logic and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Coherence Theory of Truth", auth: Alan R. White, pp. 130–31 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, formal reasoners are content to contemplate [[independence (mathematical logic)|axiomatically independent]] and sometimes mutually contradictory systems side by side, for example, the various [[noneuclidean geometry|alternative geometries]]. On the whole, coherence theories have been rejected for lacking justification in their application to other areas of truth, especially with respect to assertions about the [[Natural environment|natural world]], [[empirical]] data in general, assertions about practical matters of psychology and society, especially when used without support from the other major theories of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Coherence Theory of Truth", auth: Alan R. White, pp. 131–33, ''see'' esp., section on "Epistemological assumptions" (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

Coherence theories distinguish the thought of [[rationalism|rationalist]] philosophers, particularly of [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], and [[G.W.F. Hegel]], along with the British philosopher [[F.H. Bradley]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Coherence Theory of Truth", auth: Alan R. White, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;  They have found a resurgence also among several proponents of [[logical positivism]], notably [[Otto Neurath]] and [[Carl Hempel]].

====Constructivist theory====
{{Main|Constructivist epistemology}}

[[Constructivist epistemology|Social constructivism]] holds that truth is constructed by social processes, is historically and culturally specific, and that it is in part shaped through the power struggles within a community. Constructivism views all of our knowledge as "constructed," because it does not reflect any external "transcendent" realities (as a pure correspondence theory might hold).  Rather, perceptions of truth are viewed as contingent on convention, human perception, and social experience. It is believed by constructivists that representations of physical and biological reality, including [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], and [[gender]], are socially constructed.

[[Giambattista Vico]] was among the first to claim that history and culture were man-made. Vico's [[epistemology|epistemological]] orientation gathers the most diverse rays and unfolds in one axiom—''verum ipsum factum''—"truth itself is constructed". [[Hegel]] and [[Marx]] were among the other early proponents of the premise that truth is, or can be, socially constructed. Marx, like many critical theorists who followed, did not reject the existence of objective truth but rather distinguished between true knowledge and knowledge that has been distorted through power or ideology. For Marx, scientific and true knowledge is "in accordance with the dialectical understanding of history" and ideological knowledge is "an epiphenomenal expression of the relation of material forces in a given economic arrangement".&lt;ref&gt;May, Todd, 1993, Between Genealogy and Epistemology: Psychology, politics in the thought of Michel Foucault' with reference to Althusser and Balibar, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

====Consensus theory====
{{Main|Consensus theory of truth}}

[[Consensus theory of truth|Consensus theory]] holds that truth is whatever is agreed upon, or in some versions, might come to be agreed upon, by some specified group. Such a group might include all human beings, or a [[subset]] thereof consisting of more than one person.

Among the current advocates of consensus theory as a useful accounting of the concept of "truth" is the philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]].&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Habermas, Jürgen, ''Knowledge and Human Interests'' (English translation, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas maintains that truth is what would be agreed upon in an [[ideal speech situation]].&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Habermas, Jürgen, ''Knowledge and Human Interests'' (English translation, 1972), esp. Part III, pp. 187 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the current strong critics of consensus theory is the philosopher [[Nicholas Rescher]].&lt;ref&gt;Rescher, Nicholas, ''Pluralism: Against the Demand for Consensus'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Islamic tradition, this principle is exemplified by the [[hadith]] in which [[Muhammad]] states, "My [[ummah|community]] will never agree upon an error"&lt;ref&gt;Narrated by [http://sunnah.com/tirmidhi/33/10 al-Tirmidhi (4:2167)], ibn Majah (2:1303), Abu Dawood, and others with slightly different wordings.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pragmatic theory====
{{Main|Pragmatic theory of truth}}

The three most influential forms of the ''pragmatic theory of truth'' were introduced around the turn of the 20th century by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]].  Although there are wide differences in viewpoint among these and other proponents of pragmatic theory, they hold in common that truth is verified and confirmed by the results of putting one's concepts into practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol. 5, "Pragmatic Theory of Truth", 427 (Macmillan, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] defines truth as follows:  "Truth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal limit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring scientific belief, which concordance the abstract statement may possess by virtue of the confession of its inaccuracy and one-sidedness, and this confession is an essential ingredient of truth."&lt;ref name="Peirce Truth and Falsity"&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1901), "Truth and Falsity and Error" (in part), pp. 716–20 in [[James Mark Baldwin]], ed., ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'', v. 2. Peirce's section is entitled "''Logical''", beginning on p. 718, column 1, and ending on p. 720 with the initials "(C.S.P.)", see Google Books [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dc8YAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA718 Eprint]. Reprinted, ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 5, pp. 565–73.&lt;/ref&gt;  This statement stresses Peirce's view that ideas of approximation, incompleteness, and partiality, what he describes elsewhere as ''[[fallibilism]]'' and "reference to the future", are essential to a proper conception of truth.  Although Peirce uses words like ''concordance'' and ''correspondence'' to describe one aspect of the pragmatic [[sign relation]], he is also quite explicit in saying that definitions of truth based on mere correspondence are no more than ''nominal'' definitions, which he accords a lower status than ''real'' definitions.

[[William James]]'s version of pragmatic theory, while complex, is often summarized by his statement that "the 'true' is only the expedient in our way of thinking, just as the 'right' is only the expedient in our way of behaving."&lt;ref name=WJP&gt;James, William, ''The Meaning of Truth, A Sequel to 'Pragmatism','' (1909).&lt;/ref&gt;  By this, James meant that truth is a ''quality'', the value of which is confirmed by its effectiveness when applying concepts to practice (thus, "pragmatic").

[[John Dewey]], less broadly than James but more broadly than Peirce, held that [[inquiry]], whether scientific, technical, sociological, philosophical or cultural, is self-corrective over time ''if''  openly submitted for testing by a community of inquirers in order to clarify, justify, refine and/or refute proposed truths.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Dewey, John", auth [[Richard J. Bernstein]], p. 383 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not widely known, a new variation of the pragmatic theory was defined and wielded successfully from the 20th century forward. Defined and named by [[William Ernest Hocking]], this variation is known as "negative pragmatism".  Essentially, what works may or may not be true, but what fails cannot be true because the truth always works.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian, W.S. &amp; Sahakian, M.L., Ideas of the Great Philosophers, New York: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1966, {{LCCN|66-23155}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Feynman]] also ascribed to it: "We never are definitely right, we can only be sure we are wrong."&lt;ref name="FeynmanThe"&gt;Feynman, The Character of Physical Law, New York: Random House, 1994, {{ISBN|0-679-60127-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach incorporates many of the ideas from Peirce, James, and Dewey.  For Peirce, the idea of "... endless investigation would tend to bring about scientific belief ..." fits negative pragmatism in that a negative pragmatist would never stop testing.  As Feynman noted, an idea or theory "... could never be proved right, because tomorrow's experiment might succeed in proving wrong what you thought was right."&lt;ref name="FeynmanThe" /&gt;  Similarly, James and Dewey's ideas also ascribe truth to repeated testing which is "self-corrective" over time.

Pragmatism and negative pragmatism are also closely aligned with the [[coherence theory of truth]] in that any testing should not be isolated but rather incorporate knowledge from all human endeavors and experience.  The universe is a whole and integrated system, and testing should acknowledge and account for its diversity.  As Feynman said, "... if it disagrees with experiment, it is wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Feynman, ''The Character of Physical Law'', p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimalist (deflationary) theories===
{{Main|Deflationary theory of truth}}

Modern developments in the field of philosophy, starting with the relatively modern notion that a theory being old does not necessarily imply that it is completely flawless, have resulted in the rise of a new thesis: that the term ''truth'' does not denote a real property of sentences or propositions. This thesis is in part a response to the common use of ''truth predicates'' (e.g., that some particular thing "...is true") which was particularly prevalent in philosophical discourse on truth in the first half of the 20th century.  From this point of view, to assert that "'2 + 2 = 4' is true" is logically equivalent to asserting that "2 + 2 = 4", and the phrase "is true" is completely dispensable in this and every other context. In common parlance, truth predicates are not commonly heard, and it would be interpreted as an unusual occurrence were someone to utilise a truth predicate in an everyday conversation when asserting that something is true. Newer perspectives that take this discrepancy into account and work with sentence structures that are actually employed in common discourse can be broadly described:
* as ''deflationary'' theories of truth, since they attempt to deflate the presumed importance of the words "true" or ''truth'',
* as ''disquotational'' theories, to draw attention to the disappearance of the quotation marks in cases like the above example, or
* as ''minimalist'' theories of truth.&lt;ref name=EPT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Simon, and Simmons, Keith (eds., 1999), ''Truth'' in the Introductory section of the book.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whichever term is used, deflationary theories can be said to hold in common that "[t]he predicate 'true' is an expressive convenience, not the name of a property requiring deep analysis."&lt;ref name=EPT/&gt; Once we have identified the truth predicate's formal features and utility, deflationists argue, we have said all there is to be said about truth. Among the theoretical concerns of these views is to explain away those special cases where it ''does'' appear that the concept of truth has peculiar and interesting properties. (See, e.g., [[Semantic paradox]]es, and below.)

In addition to highlighting such formal aspects of the predicate "is true", some deflationists point out that the concept enables us to express things that might otherwise require infinitely long sentences. For example, one cannot express confidence in Michael's accuracy by asserting the endless sentence:
:''Michael says, 'snow is white' and snow is white, or he says 'roses are red' and roses are red or he says ... etc.''
This assertion can also be succinctly expressed by saying: ''What Michael says is true''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Kirkham]], [[Theories of Truth: A Critical Introduction]], MIT Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Performative theory of truth====
Attributed to [[P. F. Strawson]] is the performative theory of truth which holds that to say "'Snow is white' is true" is to perform the [[speech act]] of signaling one's agreement with the claim that snow is white (much like nodding one's head in agreement). The idea that some statements are more actions than communicative statements is not as odd as it may seem. Consider, for example, that when the bride says "I do" at the appropriate time in a wedding, she is performing the act of taking this man to be her lawful wedded husband. She is not ''describing'' herself as taking this man, but actually doing so (perhaps the most thorough analysis of such "illocutionary acts" is [[J. L. Austin]], "[[How to Do Things With Words]]"&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Austin, "How to Do Things With Words". Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;).

Strawson holds that a similar analysis is applicable to all speech acts, not just illocutionary ones: "To say a statement is true is not to make a statement about a statement, but rather to perform the act of agreeing with, accepting, or endorsing a statement.  When one says 'It's true that it's raining,' one asserts no more than 'It's raining.'  The function of [the statement] 'It's true that...' is to agree with, accept, or endorse the statement that 'it's raining.'"&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol. 6: ''Performative Theory of Truth'', auth: Gertrude Ezorsky, p. 88 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Redundancy and related theories====
{{Main|Redundancy theory of truth}}

According to the [[redundancy theory of truth]], asserting that a statement is true is completely equivalent to asserting the statement itself.  For example, making the assertion that "&amp;nbsp;'Snow is white' is true" is equivalent to asserting "Snow is white".  Redundancy theorists infer from this premise that truth is a redundant concept; that is, it is merely a word that is traditionally used in conversation or writing, generally for emphasis, but not a word that actually equates to anything in reality.  This theory is commonly attributed to [[Frank P. Ramsey]], who held that the use of words like ''fact'' and ''truth'' was nothing but a [[periphrasis|roundabout]] way of asserting a proposition, and that treating these words as separate problems in isolation from judgment was merely a "linguistic muddle".&lt;ref name="EPT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, F.P. (1927), "Facts and Propositions", Aristotelian Society Supplementary Volume 7, 153–70. Reprinted, pp. 34–51 in F.P. Ramsey, Philosophical Papers, David Hugh Mellor (ed.), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Le Morvan, Pierre. (2004) "Ramsey on Truth and Truth on Ramsey", ''The British Journal for the History of Philosophy'' 12(4), pp. 705–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant of redundancy theory is the disquotational theory which uses a modified form of [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]]'s [[Truth#Semantic theory of truth|schema]]: To say that '"P" is true' is to say that P.  A version of this theory was defended by [[C. J. F. Williams]] in his book ''What is Truth?''.  Yet another version of deflationism is the prosentential theory of truth, first developed by Dorothy Grover, Joseph Camp, and [[Nuel Belnap]] as an elaboration of Ramsey's claims.  They argue that sentences like "That's true", when said in response to "It's raining", are [[prosentence]]s, expressions that merely repeat the content of other expressions.  In the same way that ''it'' means the same as ''my dog'' in the sentence ''My dog was hungry, so I fed it'', ''That's true'' is supposed to mean the same as ''It's raining''—if you say the latter and I then say the former.  These variations do not necessarily follow Ramsey in asserting that truth is ''not'' a property, but rather can be understood to say that, for instance, the assertion "P" may well involve a substantial truth, and the theorists in this case are minimizing only the redundancy or prosentence involved in the statement such as "that's true."&lt;ref name=EPT/&gt;

Deflationary principles do not apply to representations that are not analogous to sentences, and also do not apply to many other things that are commonly judged to be true or otherwise.  Consider the analogy between the sentence "Snow is white" and the character named Snow White, both of which can be true in some sense.  To a minimalist, saying "Snow is white is true" is the same as saying "Snow is white," but to say "Snow White is true" is ''not'' the same as saying "Snow White."

====Philosophical skepticism====
{{see also|Philosophical skepticism|Certainty}}

[[Philosophical skepticism]] is generally any questioning attitude or [[doubt]] towards one or more items of knowledge or belief which ascribe truth to their assertions and propositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R. H. |last=Popkin |title=The History of Skepticism from Erasmus to Descartes (rev. ed. 1968); C. L. Stough, Greek Skepticism (1969); M. Burnyeat, ed., The Skeptical Tradition (1983); B.

[http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/s/skepcont.htm utm.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; It is often directed at domains, such as the [[supernatural]], morality ([[moral skepticism]]), religion (skepticism about the existence of God), or knowledge (skepticism about the possibility of knowledge, or of certainty).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Oxford Handbook of Skepticism|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ozv0lftrUeEC|publisher = Oxford University Press, US|year = 2008|isbn = 9780195183214|language = en|first = John|last = Greco|authorlink=John Greco (philosopher)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formally, skepticism as a topic occurs in the context of philosophy, particularly [[epistemology]], although it can be applied to any topic such as politics, religion, and pseudoscience.

Philosophical skepticism comes in various forms. Radical forms of skepticism deny that knowledge or rational belief is possible and urge us to suspend judgment regarding ascription of truth on many or all controversial matters. More moderate forms of skepticism claim only that nothing can be known with certainty, or that we can know little or nothing about the "big questions" in life, such as whether God exists or whether there is an afterlife. [[Religious skepticism]] is "doubt concerning basic religious principles (such as immortality, providence, and revelation)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of SKEPTICISM|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/skepticism|website = www.merriam-webster.com|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientific skepticism]] concerns testing beliefs for reliability, by subjecting them to [[wikt:systematic|systematic]] investigation using the [[scientific method]], to discover [[empirical evidence]] for them.

===Pluralist theories===
{{Main|Pluralist theories of truth}}
Several of the major theories of truth hold that there is a particular property the having of which makes a belief or proposition true. Pluralist theories of truth assert that there may be more than one property that makes propositions true: ethical propositions might be true by virtue of coherence. Propositions about the physical world might be true by corresponding to the objects and properties they are about.

Some of the pragmatic theories, such as those by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]] and [[William James]], included aspects of correspondence, coherence and constructivist theories.&lt;ref name="Peirce Truth and Falsity"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WJP/&gt; [[Crispin Wright]] argued in his 1992 book ''Truth and Objectivity'' that any predicate which satisfied certain platitudes about truth qualified as a truth predicate. In some discourses, Wright argued, the role of the truth predicate might be played by the notion of superassertibility.&lt;ref&gt;Truth and Objectivity, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Lynch (philosopher)|Michael Lynch]], in a 2009 book ''Truth as One and Many'', argued that we should see truth as a functional property capable of being multiply manifested in distinct properties like correspondence or coherence.&lt;ref&gt;Truth as One and Many (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Most believed theories===
According to a survey of professional philosophers and others on their philosophical views which was carried out in November 2009 (taken by 3226 respondents, including 1803 philosophy faculty members and/or PhDs and 829 philosophy graduate students) 45% of respondents accept or lean towards correspondence theories, 21% accept or lean towards deflationary theories and 14% [[Epistemic theories of truth|epistemic theories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philpapers.org/surveys/results.pl?affil=All+respondents&amp;areas0=0&amp;areas_max=1&amp;grain=medium |title=The PhilPapers Surveys – Preliminary Survey results |website=The PhilPapers Surveys |publisher=Philpapers.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal theories==

===Truth in logic===
{{Main|Logical truth|Criteria of truth|Truth value}}

[[Logic]] is concerned with the patterns in [[reason]] that can help tell us if a [[proposition]] is true or not. However, logic does not deal with truth in the absolute sense, as for instance a [[metaphysics|metaphysician]] does. Logicians use [[formal language]]s to express the truths which they are concerned with, and as such there is only truth under some [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] or truth within some [[logical system]].

A logical truth (also called an analytic truth or a necessary truth) is a statement which is true in all possible worlds&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; or under all possible interpretations, as contrasted to a ''[[fact]]'' (also called a ''[[Analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic claim]]'' or a ''[[Necessary and sufficient condition|contingency]]'') which is only true in this [[World (philosophy)|world]] as it has historically unfolded. A proposition such as "If p and q, then p" is considered to be a logical truth because of the meaning of the [[symbol (formal)|symbols]] and [[well-formed formula|words]] in it and not because of any fact of any particular world. They are such that they could not be untrue.

[[Degree of truth|Degrees]] of [[truth values|truth]] in logic may be represented using two or more discrete values, as with [[principle of bivalence|bivalent logic]] (or [[Boolean logic|binary logic]]), [[three-valued logic]], and other forms of [[finite-valued logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Kretzmann| first=Norman| title=William of Sherwood's Treatise on Syncategorematic Words| chapter=IV, section&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;2.

===Truth in mathematics===
{{Main|Model theory|Proof theory}}

There are two main approaches to truth in mathematics.  They are the ''[[model theory|model theory of truth]]'' and the ''[[proof theory|proof theory of truth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Maddy; ''Realism in Mathematics''; Series: Clarendon Paperbacks; Paperback: 216 pages; Publisher: Oxford University Press, US (October 15, 1992); {{ISBN|019824035X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, with the nineteenth century development of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] mathematical models of logic began to treat "truth", also represented as "T" or "1", as an arbitrary constant.  "Falsity" is also an arbitrary constant, which can be represented as "F" or "0".  In [[propositional logic]], these symbols can be manipulated according to a set of [[axioms]] and [[rules of inference]], often given in the form of [[truth table]]s.

In addition, from at least the time of [[Hilbert's program]] at the turn of the twentieth century to the proof of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] and the development of the [[Church–Turing thesis]] in the early part of that century, true statements in mathematics were [[logical positivism|generally assumed]] to be those statements that are provable in a formal axiomatic system.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott Mendelson; ''Introduction to Mathematical Logic''; Series: Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications; Hardcover: 469 pages; Publisher: Chapman and Hall/CRC; 5 edition (August 11, 2009); {{ISBN|1584888768}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The works of [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Alan Turing]], and others shook this assumption, with the development of statements that are true but cannot be proven within the system.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' Chaitin, Gregory L., ''The Limits of Mathematics'' (1997) esp. 89 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; Two examples of the latter can be found in [[Hilbert's problems]]. Work on [[Hilbert's 10th problem]] led in the late twentieth century to the construction of specific [[Diophantine equations]] for which it is undecidable whether they have a solution,&lt;ref&gt;M. Davis. "Hilbert's Tenth Problem is Unsolvable." ''American Mathematical Monthly'' 80, pp. 233–69, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; or even if they do, whether they have a finite or infinite number of solutions. More fundamentally, [[Hilbert's first problem]] was on the [[continuum hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, Benjamin H.. ''The Honors Class. Hilbert's Problems and Their Solvers'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel and [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] showed that this hypothesis cannot be proved or disproved using the standard [[axiom]]s of [[set theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Chaitin, Gregory L., ''The Limits of Mathematics'' (1997) 1–28, 89 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of some, then, it is equally reasonable to take either the continuum hypothesis or its negation as a new axiom.

Reconsidered assumptions about the essence of truth arose in the wake of Gödel's incompleteness theorems. [[Martin Heidegger]] pointed out that truth may be essentially a matter of letting [[Being and Time|beings]] (entities of any kind, which can include logical propositions)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Heidegger| first=Martin| title=Being and Time| year=1927| url=http://pdf-objects.com/files/Heidegger-Martin-Being-and-Time-trans.-Macquarrie-Robinson-Blackwell-1962.pdf}} See page 39.&lt;/ref&gt; be free to reveal themselves as they are, and stated:
{{quote|“Truth” is not a feature of correct propositions which are asserted of an “object” by a human “subject” and then are “valid” somewhere, in what sphere we know not. Rather, truth is disclosure of beings through which an openness essentially unfolds [''west''].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Heidegger| first=Martin| title=On the Essence of Truth| year=1943| url=https://aphelis.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Martin-Heidegger-On-the-Essence-of-Truth.pdf}} See pages 7-8. The quoted text is translated from the German by John Sallis.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gödel agreed that the ability to perceive the truth of a mathematical or logical proposition is a matter of [[logical intuition|intuition]], an ability he admitted could be ultimately beyond the scope of a formal theory of logic or mathematics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Ravitch| first=Harold| title=On Gödel's Philosophy of Mathematics| year=1998| url=http://www.friesian.com/goedel/chap-2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Solomon| first=Martin| title=On Kurt Gödel's Philosophy of Mathematics| year=1998| url=http://calculemus.org/lect/07logika/godel-solomon.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps best considered in the realm of human [[comprehension (logic)|comprehension]] and communication, but commented:
{{quote|The more I think about language, the more it amazes me that people ever understand each other at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Wang| first=Hao| title=A Logical Journey: From Gödel to Philosophy| publisher=The MIT Press| year=1997| url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0262261251}} (A discussion of Gödel's views on [[logical intuition]] is woven throughout the book; the quote appears on page 75.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Tarski's semantic theory of truth===
{{main|Semantic theory of truth|Tarski's theory of truth}}

The [[semantic theory of truth]] has as its general case for a given language:
:'P' is true if and only if P
where 'P' refers to the sentence (the sentence's name), and P is just the sentence itself.

[[Tarski's theory of truth]] (named after [[Alfred Tarski]]) was developed for formal languages, such as [[formal logic]]. Here he restricted it in this way: no language could contain its own truth predicate, that is, the expression ''is true'' could only apply to sentences in some other language. The latter he called an ''object language'', the language being talked about. (It may, in turn, have a truth predicate that can be applied to sentences in still another language.) The reason for his restriction was that languages that contain their own truth predicate will contain [[Liar paradox|paradoxical]] sentences such as, "This sentence is not true". As a result, Tarski held that the semantic theory could not be applied to any natural language, such as English, because they contain their own truth predicates. [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] used it as the foundation of his [[truth-conditional semantics]] and linked it to [[radical interpretation]] in a form of [[coherentism]].

[[Bertrand Russell]] is credited with noticing the existence of such paradoxes even in the best symbolic formations of mathematics in his day, in particular the paradox that came to be named after him, [[Russell's paradox]]. Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] attempted to solve these problems in ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' by putting statements into a hierarchy of [[type theory|types]], wherein a statement cannot refer to itself, but only to statements lower in the hierarchy.  This in turn led to new orders of difficulty regarding the precise natures of types and the structures of conceptually possible [[type system]]s that have yet to be resolved to this day.

===Kripke's semantic theory of truth===
{{Main|Kripke's theory of truth}}
[[Kripke's theory of truth]] (named after [[Saul Kripke]]) contends that a natural language can in fact contain its own truth predicate without giving rise to contradiction. He showed how to construct one as follows:
* Begin with a subset of sentences of a natural language that contains no occurrences of the expression "is true" (or "is false"). So ''The barn is big'' is included in the subset, but not " ''The barn is big'' is true", nor problematic sentences such as "''This sentence'' is false".
* Define truth just for the sentences in that subset.
* Then extend the definition of truth to include sentences that predicate truth or falsity of one of the original subset of sentences. So "''The barn is big'' is true" is now included, but not either "''This sentence'' is false" nor "'''The barn is big'' is true' is true".
* Next, define truth for all sentences that predicate truth or falsity of a member of the second set. Imagine this process repeated infinitely, so that truth is defined for ''The barn is big''; then for "''The barn is big'' is true"; then for "'''The barn is big'' is true' is true", and so on.

Notice that truth never gets defined for sentences like ''This sentence is false'', since it was not in the original subset and does not predicate truth of any sentence in the original or any subsequent set. In Kripke's terms, these are "ungrounded." Since these sentences are never assigned either truth or falsehood even if the process is carried out infinitely, Kripke's theory implies that some sentences are neither true nor false. This contradicts the [[Principle of bivalence]]: every sentence must be either true or false. Since this principle is a key premise in deriving the [[Liar paradox]], the paradox is dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. "Outline of a Theory of Truth", Journal of Philosophy, 72 (1975), 690–716&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it has been shown by [[Proof sketch for Gödel's first incompleteness theorem|Gödel]] that self-reference cannot be avoided naively, since propositions about seemingly unrelated objects can have an informal self-referential meaning; in Gödel's work, these objects are integer numbers, and they have an informal meaning regarding propositions. In fact, this idea—manifested by the [[diagonal lemma]]—is the basis for [[Tarski's undefinability theorem|Tarski's theorem]] that truth cannot be consistently defined.

It has thus been claimed&lt;ref&gt;Keith Simmons, ''Universality and the Liar: An Essay on Truth and the Diagonal Argument'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1993&lt;/ref&gt; that Kripke's system indeed leads to contradiction: while its truth predicate is only partial, it does give truth value (true/false) to propositions such as the one built in Tarski's proof, and is therefore inconsistent. While there is still a debate on whether Tarski's proof can be implemented to every similar partial truth system, none have been shown to be consistent by [[Consistency proof|acceptable methods]] used in [[mathematical logic]].

===Revision theory of truth===
{{Main|Revision theory#Truth}}

The revision theory of truth, as developed by Anil Gupta and Nuel Belnap, takes truth to be a circular concept whose definition is the set of biconditionals of the form
:'A' is true if and only if A.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta and Belnap (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike Kripke's theory of truth, revision theory can be used with classical logic and can maintain the principle of bivalence.

==Folk beliefs about truth==
The [[truth predicate]] "''P'' is true" has great practical value in human language, allowing us to ''efficiently'' endorse or impeach claims made by others, to emphasize the truth or falsity of a statement, or to enable various indirect ([[Gricean]]) conversational implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scharp|first1=Kevin|title=Replacing truth|date=2013|publisher=Oxford Univ.

Telling what is not true may result in legal and social penalties.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the oldest surviving law text, the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]], lists penalties for false accusations of sorcery or adultery, as well as for committing perjury in court. Even four-year-old children can pass simple "[[Theory of mind#False-belief task|false belief]]" tests and successfully assess that another individual's belief diverges from reality in a specific way;&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, Henry M., David Cross, and Julanne Watson. "Meta‐analysis of theory‐of‐mind development: the truth about false belief." Child development 72.3 (2001): 655-684.&lt;/ref&gt; by adulthood we have strong implicit intuitions about "truth" that form a "folk theory" of truth. These intuitions include:&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Michael P. "Alethic functionalism and our folk theory of truth." Synthese 145.1 (2005): 29-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Capture (''T''-in): If ''P'', then ''P'' is true
* Release (''T''-out): If ''P'' is true, then ''P''
* [[Law of noncontradiction|Noncontradiction]]: A statement can't be both true and false
* Normativity: It is usually good to believe what is true
* False beliefs: The notion that believing a statement doesn't necessarily make it true

Like many folk theories, our folk theory of truth is useful in everyday life but, upon deep analysis, turns out to be technically self-contradictory; in particular, any [[formal system]] that fully obeys Capture and Release semantics for truth (also known as the ''[[T-schema]]''), and that also respects classical logic, is provably [[inconsistent]] and succumbs to the [[liar paradox]] or to a similar contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;Bueno, Otávio, and Mark Colyvan.

==Notable views==
[[File:Truth.jpg|thumb|''La Vérité'' "Truth" by [[Jules Joseph Lefebvre]]]]

===Ancient history===
The ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] origins of the words "true" and "truth" have some consistent definitions throughout great spans of history that were often associated with topics of [[logic]], [[geometry]], [[mathematics]], [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], [[inductive reasoning|induction]], and [[natural philosophy]].

[[Socrates]]', [[Plato]]'s and [[Aristotle]]'s ideas about truth are seen by some as consistent with correspondence theory. In his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Aristotle stated:  "To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true".&lt;ref name=StanfordCorr&gt;David, Marion (2005). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence/#1 "Correspondence Theory of Truth"] in [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] proceeds to say of Aristotle:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] Aristotle sounds much more like a genuine correspondence theorist in the ''Categories'' (12b11, 14b14), where he talks of "underlying things" that make statements true and implies that these "things" (pragmata) are logically structured situations or facts (viz., his sitting, his not sitting). Most influential is his claim in ''De Interpretatione'' (16a3) that thoughts are "likenesses" (homoiosis) of things. Although he nowhere defines truth in terms of a thought's likeness to a thing or fact, it is clear that such a definition would fit well into his overall philosophy of mind. [...]&lt;ref name=StanfordCorr/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Very similar statements can also be found in Plato (Cratylus 385b2, Sophist 263b).&lt;ref name=StanfordCorr/&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], Truth is defined as "unchangeable", "that which has no distortion", "that which is beyond distinctions of time, space, and person", "that which pervades the universe in all its constancy". The human body, therefore is not completely true as it changes with time, for example. There are many references, properties and explanations of truth by Hindu sages that explain varied facets of truth, such as the national motto of [[India]]: "[[Satyameva Jayate]]" (Truth alone wins), as well as "Satyam muktaye" (Truth liberates), "Satya' is 'Parahit'artham' va'unmanaso yatha'rthatvam' satyam" (Satya is the benevolent use of words and the mind for the welfare of others or in other words responsibilities is truth too), "When one is firmly established in speaking truth, the fruits of action become subservient to him ( patanjali yogasutras, sutra number 2.36 ), "The face of truth is covered by a golden bowl. ''Unveil it, O Pusan (Sun), so that I who have truth as my duty (satyadharma) may see it!''" (Brhadaranyaka V 15 1–4 and the brief IIsa Upanisad 15–18), Truth is superior to silence ([[Manusmriti]]), etc. Combined with other words, satya acts as modifier, like "'''ultra'''" or "'''highest'''," or more literally "'''truest'''," connoting '''purity and excellence'''. For example, satyaloka is the "highest heaven' and Satya Yuga is the "golden age" or best of the four cyclical cosmic ages in Hinduism, and so on.

===Middle Ages===

====Avicenna (980–1037)====
In [[early Islamic philosophy]], [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina) defined truth in his work [[Kitab Al-Shifa]] ''[[The Book of Healing]]'', Book I, Chapter 8, as:

''{{quote|What corresponds in the mind to what is outside it.&lt;ref&gt;Osman Amin (2007), "Influence of Muslim Philosophy on the West", ''Monthly Renaissance'' '''17''' (11).&lt;/ref&gt;}}''

[[Avicenna]] elaborated on his definition of truth later in Book VIII, Chapter 6:

''{{Quote|The truth of a thing is the property of the being of each thing which has been established in it.&lt;ref name=Aertsen&gt;Jan A. Aertsen (1988), ''Nature and Creature: Thomas Aquinas's Way of Thought'', p. 152. Brill, {{ISBN|90-04-08451-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}''

However, this definition is merely a rendering of the [[medieval]] Latin translation of the work by Simone van Riet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| author = Simone van Riet
| title = Liber de philosophia prima, sive Scientia divina
| page = 413
| language = Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt; A modern translation of the original Arabic text states:

''{{quote|Truth is also said of the veridical belief in the existence [of something]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| isbn = 978-0-934893-77-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Aquinas (1225–1274)====
Reevaluating Avicenna, and also Augustine and Aristotle, [[Thomas Aquinas]] stated in his ''Disputed Questions on Truth'':

{{quote|A natural thing, being placed between two intellects, is called ''true'' insofar as it conforms to either. It is said to be true with respect to its conformity with the divine intellect insofar as it fulfills the end to which it was ordained by the divine intellect... With respect to its conformity with a human intellect, a thing is said to be true insofar as it is such as to cause a true estimate about itself.&lt;ref&gt;''Disputed Questions on Truth'', 1, 2, c, reply to Obj. 1. Trans. Mulligan, McGlynn, Schmidt, ''Truth'', vol. I, pp. 10–12.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, for Aquinas, the truth of the human intellect (logical truth) is based on the truth in things (ontological truth).&lt;ref&gt;"Veritas supra ens fundatur" (Truth is founded on being). ''Disputed Questions on Truth'', 10, 2, reply to Obj. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, he wrote an elegant re-statement of Aristotle's view in his [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1016.htm Summa I.16.1]:

{{quote|Veritas est adæquatio intellectus et rei. &lt;br&gt; (Truth is the conformity of the intellect and things.)}}  Aquinas also said that real things participate in the act of being of the [[God|Creator God]] who is Subsistent Being, Intelligence, and Truth. Thus, these beings possess the light of intelligibility and are knowable. These things (beings; [[reality]]) are the foundation of the truth that is found in the human mind, when it acquires knowledge of things, first through the [[sense]]s, then through the [[understanding]] and the [[judgement]] done by [[reason]]. For Aquinas, human [[intelligence]] ("intus", within and "legere", to read) has the capability to reach the [[essence]] and [[existence]] of things because it has a non-material, [[Spirituality|spiritual]] element, although some moral, educational, and other elements might interfere with its capability.

====Changing concepts of truth in the Middle Ages====
[[Richard Firth Green]] examined the concept of truth in the later Middle Ages in his ''A Crisis of Truth'', and concludes that roughly during the reign of [[Richard II of England]] the very meaning of the concept changes. The idea of the oath, which was so much part and parcel of for instance [[Romance (heroic literature)|Romance literature]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rock|first=Catherine A.|year=2006|title=Forsworn and Fordone: Arcite as Oath-Breaker in the "Knight's Tale"|journal=[[The Chaucer Review]]|volume=40|issue=4|pages=416–32|jstor=25094334|doi=10.1353/cr.2006.0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; changes from a subjective concept to a more objective one (in [[Derek Pearsall]]'s summary).&lt;ref name=pearsall&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearsall|first=Derek|year=2004|title=Medieval Literature and Historical Enquiry|journal=[[Modern Language Review]]|volume=99|issue=4|pages=xxxi–xlii|jstor=3738608|doi=10.2307/3738608}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas truth (the "trouthe" of ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'') was first "an ethical truth in which truth is understood to reside in persons", in Ricardian England it "transforms...into a [[political truth]] in which truth is understood to reside in documents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fowler|first=Elizabeth|year=2003|title=Rev. of Green, ''A Crisis of Truth''|journal=[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]|volume=78|issue=1|pages=179–82|jstor=3301477|doi=10.1017/S0038713400099310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern age===

====Kant (1724–1804)====
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]

[[Immanuel Kant]] endorses a definition of truth along the lines of the correspondence theory of truth.&lt;ref name=StanfordCorr/&gt; Kant writes in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'': "The nominal definition of truth, namely that it is the agreement of cognition with its object, is here granted and presupposed".&lt;ref name = "Kant-1781"&gt;Kant, Immanuel (1781/1787), ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. Translated and edited by Paul Guyer and Allen W. Wood (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), A58/B82.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kant denies that this correspondence definition of truth provides us with a test or criterion to establish which judgements are true. Kant states in his logic lectures:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] Truth, it is said, consists in the agreement of cognition with its object. In consequence of this mere nominal definition, my cognition, to count as true, is supposed to agree with its object. Now I can compare the object with my cognition, however, only ''by cognizing it''.&lt;!-- I wonder if the original had this cursive... --&gt; Hence my cognition is supposed to confirm itself, which is far short of being sufficient for truth. For since the object is outside me, the cognition in me, all I can ever pass judgement on is whether my cognition of the object agrees with my cognition of the object.

The ancients called such a circle in explanation a ''diallelon''. And actually the logicians were always reproached with this mistake by the sceptics, who observed that with this definition of truth it is just as when someone makes a statement before a court and in doing so appeals to a witness with whom no one is acquainted, but who wants to establish his credibility by maintaining that the one who called him as witness is an honest man. The accusation was grounded, too. Only the solution of the indicated problem is impossible without qualification and for every man. [...]&lt;ref name = "Kant-1801"&gt;Kant, Immanuel (1801), ''The Jäsche Logic'', in ''Lectures on Logic''. Translated and edited by J. Michael Young (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), pp. 557–58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This passage makes use of his distinction between nominal and real definitions. A nominal definition explains the meaning of a linguistic expression. A real definition describes the essence of certain [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] and enables us to determine whether any given item falls within the definition.&lt;ref name = "Vanzo-Kant"&gt;Alberto Vanzo, "Kant on the Nominal Definition of Truth", ''Kant-Studien'', 101 (2010), pp. 147–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant holds that the definition of truth is merely nominal and, therefore, we cannot employ it to establish which judgements are true. According to Kant, the ancient skeptics were critical of the logicians for holding that, by means of a merely nominal definition of truth, they can establish which judgements are true. They were trying to do something that is "impossible without qualification and for every man".&lt;ref name = "Kant-1801" /&gt;

====Hegel (1770–1831)====
[[Georg Hegel]] distanced his philosophy from psychology by presenting truth as being an external self-moving object instead of being related to inner, subjective thoughts. Hegel's truth is analogous to the [[mechanics]] of a material body in motion under the influence of its own inner force. "Truth is its own self-movement within itself."&lt;ref&gt;"Die Wahrheit ist die Bewegung ihrer an ihr selbst." ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', Preface, ¶ 48&lt;/ref&gt; Teleological truth moves itself in the three-step form of [[Dialectic|dialectical triplicity]] toward the final goal of perfect, final, absolute truth. According to Hegel, the progression of philosophical truth is a resolution of past oppositions into increasingly more accurate approximations of absolute truth. [[Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus|Chalybäus]] used the terms "[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis]]", "[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|antithesis]]", and "[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]]" to describe Hegel's dialectical triplicity.  The "thesis" consists of an incomplete historical movement. To resolve the incompletion, an "antithesis" occurs which opposes the "thesis." In turn, the "synthesis" appears when the "thesis" and "antithesis" become [[Aufheben|reconciled]] and a higher level of truth is obtained. This "synthesis" thereby becomes a "thesis," which will again necessitate an "antithesis," requiring a new "synthesis" until a final state is reached as the result of reason's historical movement. History is the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute Spirit]] moving toward a goal. This historical progression will finally conclude itself when the Absolute Spirit understands its own infinite self at the very end of history. Absolute Spirit will then be the complete expression of an infinite [[God]].

====Schopenhauer (1788–1860)====
For [[Arthur Schopenhauer]],&lt;ref&gt;''On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'', §§ 29–33&lt;/ref&gt; a [[judgment]] is a combination or separation of two or more [[concept]]s. If a judgment is to be an expression of [[knowledge]], it must have a [[Principle of sufficient reason|sufficient reason]] or ground by which the judgment could be called true. ''Truth is the reference of a judgment to something different from itself which is its sufficient reason (ground)''. Judgments can have material, formal, transcendental, or metalogical truth. A judgment has ''material'' truth if its concepts are based on intuitive perceptions that are generated from sensations. If a judgment has its reason (ground) in another judgment, its truth is called logical or ''formal''. If a judgment, of, for example, pure mathematics or pure science, is based on the forms (space, time, causality) of intuitive, empirical knowledge, then the judgment has ''transcendental'' truth.

====Kierkegaard (1813–1855)====
When [[Søren Kierkegaard]], as his character ''Johannes Climacus'', ends his writings: ''My thesis was, subjectivity, heartfelt is the truth'', he does not advocate for [[subjectivism]] in its extreme form (the theory that something is true simply because one believes it to be so), but rather that the objective approach to matters of personal truth cannot shed any light upon that which is most essential to a person's life. Objective truths are concerned with the facts of a person's being, while subjective truths are concerned with a person's way of being. Kierkegaard agrees that objective truths for the study of subjects like mathematics, science, and history are relevant and necessary, but argues that objective truths do not shed any light on a person's inner relationship to existence. At best, these truths can only provide a severely narrowed perspective that has little to do with one's actual experience of life.&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript''. Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

While objective truths are final and static, subjective truths are continuing and dynamic. The truth of one's existence is a living, inward, and subjective experience that is always in the process of becoming. The values, morals, and spiritual approaches a person adopts, while not denying the existence of objective truths of those beliefs, can only become truly known when they have been inwardly appropriated through subjective experience. Thus, Kierkegaard criticizes all systematic philosophies which attempt to know life or the truth of existence via theories and objective knowledge about reality. As Kierkegaard claims, human truth is something that is continually occurring, and a human being cannot find truth separate from the subjective experience of one's own existing, defined by the values and fundamental essence that consist of one's way of life.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Michael. ''Kierkegaard'', Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nietzsche (1844–1900)====
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] believed the search for truth, or 'the will to truth', was a consequence of the ''[[will to power]]'' of philosophers. He thought that truth should be used as long as it promoted life and the ''will to power'', and he thought untruth was better than truth if it had this life enhancement as a consequence. As he wrote in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', "The falseness of a judgment is to us not necessarily an objection to a judgment... The question is to what extent it is life-advancing, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps even species-breeding..." (aphorism 4). He proposed the ''will to power'' as a truth only because, according to him, it was the most life-affirming and sincere perspective one could have.

Robert Wicks discusses Nietzsche's basic view of truth as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] Some scholars regard Nietzsche's 1873 unpublished essay, "On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense" ("Über Wahrheit und Lüge im außermoralischen Sinn") as a keystone in his thought. In this essay, Nietzsche rejects the idea of universal constants, and claims that what we call "truth" is only "a mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms." His view at this time is that arbitrariness completely prevails within human experience: concepts originate via the very artistic transference of nerve stimuli into images; "truth" is nothing more than the invention of fixed conventions for merely practical purposes, especially those of repose, security and consistence. [...]&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wicks, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/#EarWri187187 Friedrich Nietzsche – Early Writings: 1872–1876], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  (Spring 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Separately Nietzsche suggested that an ancient, metaphysical belief in the divinity of Truth lies at the heart of and has served as the foundation for the entire subsequent [[Western intellectual tradition]]: "But you will have gathered what I am getting at, namely, that it is still a metaphysical faith on which our faith in science rests—that even we knowers of today, we godless anti-metaphysicians still take ''our'' fire too, from the flame lit by the thousand-year old faith, the Christian faith which was also Plato's faith, that God is Truth; that Truth is 'Divine'..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vf8KETLiKXMC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;lpg=PA201&amp;dq=%22even%20we%20knowers%20of%20today%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22even%20we%20knowers%20of%20today%22&amp;f=false|title=Nietzsche: The Gay Science: With a Prelude in German Rhymes and an Appendix of Songs|first1=Friedrich|last1=Nietzsche|first2=Bernard|last2=Williams|first3=Josefine|last3=Nauckhoff|date=23 August 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780521636452}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wMzu8j4D1SYC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=%22even%20we%20knowers%20of%20today%22#v=onepage&amp;q=god%20is%20truth&amp;f=false|title=Nietzsche: 'On the Genealogy of Morality' and Other Writings Student Edition|first=Friedrich|last=Nietzsche|date=30 October 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9781139461214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heidegger (1889–1976)====
Other philosophers take this common meaning to be secondary and derivative. According to [[Martin Heidegger]], the original meaning and [[essence]] of truth in [[Ancient Greece]] was unconcealment, or the revealing or bringing of what was previously hidden into the open, as indicated by the original Greek term for truth, ''[[aletheia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://aphelis.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Martin-Heidegger-On-the-Essence-of-Truth.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontology.co/heidegger-aletheia.htm|title=Martin Heidegger on Aletheia (Truth) as Unconcealment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this view, the conception of truth as correctness is a later derivation from the concept's original essence, a development Heidegger traces to the [[Latin]] term ''[[veritas]]''.

====Whitehead (1861–1947)====
[[Alfred North Whitehead]], a British mathematician who became an American philosopher, said: "There are no whole truths; all truths are half-truths. It is trying to treat them as whole truths that plays the devil".&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Dialogues'', 1954: Prologue.&lt;/ref&gt;

The logical progression or connection of this line of thought is to conclude that truth can lie, since [[half-truth]]s are deceptive and may lead to a false conclusion.

====Peirce (1839–1914)====
[[Pragmatists]] like [[C. S. Peirce]] take truth to have some manner of essential relation to human practices for inquiring into and [[discovering]] truth, with Peirce himself holding that truth is what human [[inquiry]] would find out on a matter, if our practice of inquiry were taken as far as it could profitably go: "The opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate, is what we mean by the truth..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peirce.org/writings/p119.html|title=How to Make Our Ideas Clear|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nishida (1870–1945)====
According to [[Kitaro Nishida]], "knowledge of things in the world begins with the differentiation of unitary consciousness into knower and known and ends with self and things becoming one again. Such unification takes form not only in knowing but in the valuing (of truth) that directs knowing, the willing that directs action, and the feeling or emotive reach that directs sensing."&lt;ref&gt;John Maraldo, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nishida-kitaro/#2.2 Nishida Kitarô – Self-Awareness], in: ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2005 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fromm (1900–1980)====
[[Erich Fromm]] finds that trying to discuss truth as "absolute truth" is sterile and that emphasis ought to be placed on "optimal truth". He considers truth as stemming from the survival imperative of grasping one's environment physically and intellectually, whereby young children instinctively seek truth so as to orient themselves in "a strange and powerful world". The accuracy of their perceived approximation of the truth will therefore have direct consequences on their ability to deal with their environment. Fromm can be understood to define truth as a functional approximation of reality. His vision of optimal truth is described partly in "Man from Himself: An Inquiry into the Psychology of Ethics" (1947), from which excerpts are included below.

: the dichotomy between 'absolute = perfect' and 'relative = imperfect' has been superseded in all fields of scientific thought, where "it is generally recognized that there is no absolute truth but nevertheless that there are objectively valid laws and principles".

: In that respect, "a scientifically or rationally valid statement means that the power of reason is applied to all the available data of observation without any of them being suppressed or falsified for the sake of a desired result". The history of science is "a history of inadequate and incomplete statements, and every new insight makes possible the recognition of the inadequacies of previous propositions and offers a springboard for creating a more adequate formulation."

: As a result "the history of thought is the history of an ever-increasing approximation to the truth. Scientific knowledge is not absolute but optimal; it contains the optimum of truth attainable in a given historical period." Fromm furthermore notes that "different cultures have emphasized various aspects of the truth" and that increasing interaction between cultures allows for these aspects to reconcile and integrate, increasing further the approximation to the truth.

====Foucault (1926–1984)====
[[File:What-is-truth02.jpg|thumb|''[[John 18:38|Quid Est Veritas?]]'' [[Christ]] and [[Pilate]], by [[Nikolai Ge]].]]

Truth, says [[Michel Foucault]], is problematic when any attempt is made to see truth as an "objective" quality.  He prefers not to use the term truth itself but "Regimes of Truth".  In his historical investigations he found truth to be something that was itself a part of, or embedded within, a given power structure.  Thus Foucault's view shares much in common with the concepts of [[Truth#Nietzsche|Nietzsche]].  Truth for Foucault is also something that shifts through various [[episteme]] throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, M. "The Order of Things", London: Vintage Books, 1970 (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Baudrillard (1929–2007)====
[[Jean Baudrillard]] considered truth to be largely simulated, that is pretending to have something, as opposed to dissimulation, pretending to not have something.  He took his cue from [[iconoclasm|iconoclasts]] who he claims knew that images of God demonstrated that God did not exist.&lt;ref name = "Baudrillard"&gt;Jean Baudrillard. Simulacra and Simulation. Michigan: Michigan University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Baudrillard wrote in "Precession of the Simulacra":
::The [[simulacrum]] is never that which conceals the truth—it is the truth which conceals that there is none.  The simulacrum is true.
::—Ecclesiastes&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard, Jean. [http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html "Simulacra and Simulations", in ''Selected Writings''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040209024621/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html |date=2004-02-09 }}, ed. [[Mark Poster]], [[Stanford University Press]], 1988; 166 ''ff''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard's attribution of this quote to [[Ecclesiastes]] is deliberately fictional. "Baudrillard attributes this quote to Ecclesiastes.  However, the quote is a fabrication (see Jean Baudrillard.  Cool Memories III, 1991–95. London:   Verso, 1997). Editor's note: In Fragments: Conversations With François L'Yvonnet. New York: Routledge, 2004:11, Baudrillard acknowledges this 'Borges-like' fabrication." Cited in footnote #4 in Smith, Richard G., [https://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol2_1/smith.htm#_edn4 "Lights, Camera, Action: Baudrillard and the Performance of Representations"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425060347/https://www2.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol2_1/smith.htm#_edn4 |date=2018-04-25 }}, International Journal of Baudrillard Studies, Volume 2, Number 1 (January 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of simulacra that Baudrillard cited were: that prisons simulate the "truth" that society is free; scandals (e.g., [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]]) simulate that corruption is corrected; Disney simulates that the U.S. itself is an adult place. One must remember that though such examples seem extreme, such extremity is an important part of Baudrillard's theory. For a less extreme example, consider how movies usually end with the bad being punished, humiliated, or otherwise failing, thus affirming for viewers the concept that the good end happily and the bad unhappily, a narrative which implies that the status quo and established power structures are largely legitimate.&lt;ref name = "Baudrillard"/&gt;

==In medicine and psychiatry==
There is controversy as to the truth value of a proposition made in [[bad faith]] self-deception, such as when a [[hypochondriac]] has a complaint with no physical symptom.&lt;ref name=PMREN&gt;"Absent a lesion or a physiological disturbance to account readily for the complaint, the complaint was likely to be regarded as male fide", Post-Modern Reflections on the Ethics of Naming, The Ethics of Diagnosis Philosophy and Medicine, 1992, Volume 40, Section V, 275–300, George Khushf, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/r6735871m3782056/ springerlink.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- "Merge to Self preservation page" template removed - please see Talk page --&gt;
The '''will to life''' or ''Wille zum Leben'' is a psychological force to fight for [[self-preservation]] seen as an important and active process of conscious and unconscious [[reasoning]].{{cn|date=November 2017}} The German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] is the first to give name to this force.

There are significant correlations between the will to live and existential, psychological, social, and physical sources of [[Distress (medicine)|distress]].&lt;ref&gt;"Understanding the Will to Live in Patients Nearing Death". The Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the will to live can be seen as directly impacted by [[hope]].{{cn|date=November 2017}} Many, who overcome [[near-death experience]]s with no explanation, have described the will to live as a direct component of their survival.&lt;ref&gt;No Author (2003). What is the Will to Live. Retrieved from http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-will-to-live.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between the wish to die versus the wish to live is also a unique risk factor for [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Gregory K.; Steer, RA; Henriques, GR; Beck, AT (1977-1979), "The Internal Struggle Between the Wish to Die and the Wish to Live: A Risk Factor for Suicide", American Journal of Psychiatry (Am J Psychiatry) 162 (10): 1977–1979, {{doi|10.1176/appi.ajp.162.10.1977}}, {{PMID|16199851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
In psychology, the will to live is the [[Drive theory|drive]] for self-preservation, usually coupled with [[Expectation (epistemic)|expectations]] for future improvement in one's state in life.&lt;ref&gt;"Will to Live." McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine. 2002. The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. 28 Nov. 2017 https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/will+to+live&lt;/ref&gt; The will to live is an important concept when attempting to understand and comprehend why we do what we do in order to stay alive, and for as long as we can. This can be related to either one's push for survival on the brink of death, or someone who is just trying to find a meaning to continuing their life. Some researchers say that people who have a reason or purpose in life during such dreadful and horrific experiences will often appear to fare better than those that may find such experiences overwhelming.&lt;ref&gt;Frankl, V. E. (1963). In Man's search for meaning. Boston: Beacon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Everyday, people undergo countless types of negative experiences, some to which may be demoralizing, hurtful, or tragic. An ongoing question continues to be what keeps the will to live in these situations. Some people that claim to have experienced instances of the will to live, have many different explanations behind it.&lt;ref&gt;Grohol, J. (2009). The Power of the Will to Live. Psych Central. Retrieved on November 21, 2012, from http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2009/12/28/the-power-of-the-will-to-live&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The will to live is considered to be a very basic drive in humans; but not necessarily the main driving force. In [[psychotherapy]], [[Sigmund Freud]] termed the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]], which is the seeking of [[pleasure]] and avoiding of [[suffering|pain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Viktor Frankl]], after spending time in a German concentration camp, developed psychotherapy called [[logotherapy]], or the "will to meaning". [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] highlights the innate appetite that people possess for love and belonging but before all this there is the very basic and powerful will to live.
Psychologists have established that human beings are a goal-oriented species. In assessing the will to live, it should be borne in mind that it could be augmented or diminished by the relative strength of other simultaneously existent drives. Psychologists generally agree that there is the will to live, the will to pleasure, the will to superiority and the will to connection. There are also usually varying degrees of curiosity with regard to what may be termed the will to identity or establishing meaningful personal responses. The will to live is a platform without which it would not be possible to satisfy the other drives. However, this overlooks the possibility that there is a commonality among all creatures that drives all others urges. And that is the need to reproduce and ensure the preservation of the species.&lt;ref&gt;Oster, C. (). How Do We Define "The Will to Live".

== Similarity to self-preservation ==

Self-preservation is a behavior that ensures the survival of an organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/self-preservation|title=Self-preservation - definition of self-preservation by The Free Dictionary|work=TheFreeDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pain]] and [[fear]] are integral parts of this mechanism. Pain motivates the individual to withdraw from damaging situations, to protect a damaged body part while it heals, and to avoid similar experiences in the future.&lt;ref name= Lynn1984&gt;{{vcite book | author = Lynn B | authorlink = | editor =  Winlow W, Holden AV | others = | title = The neurobiology of pain: Symposium of the Northern Neurobiology Group, held at Leeds on 18 April 1983 | edition = | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester | year = 1984 | pages = | isbn = 0-7190-0996-0 | page = 106 | chapter = Cutaneous nociceptors | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=S7rnAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA106&amp;=true#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most pain resolves promptly once the painful stimulus is removed and the body has healed, but sometimes pain persists despite removal of the stimulus and apparent healing of the body; and sometimes pain arises in the absence of any detectable stimulus, damage or disease.&lt;ref name="Raj_2007"&gt;{{vcite book | author = Raj PP | authorlink = | editor = Niv D, Kreitler S, Diego B, Lamberto A | others = | title = The Handbook of Chronic Pain | edition = | publisher = Nova Biomedical Books | location = | year = 2007 | pages = | isbn = 1-60021-044-9 | oclc = | chapter = Taxonomy and classification of pain | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG4Svh_UL3UC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fear causes the organism to seek safety and may cause a release of [[adrenaline]],&lt;ref name=gleitman&gt;{{Cite book|author= [[Henry Gleitman]], [[Alan J. Fridlund]] and [[Daniel Reisberg]] |title= Psychology |edition= 6 |year= 2004 |publisher= [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]  |isbn= 0-393-97767-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/psychology/fear.html | work=CBC News | title=Fear factors | date=31 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has the effect of increased strength and heightened senses such as hearing, smell, and sight. Self-preservation may also be interpreted figuratively, in regard to the coping mechanisms one needs to prevent emotional trauma from distorting the mind (see: [[defence mechanism]].)

Even the most simple of living organisms (for example, the single-celled bacteria) are typically under intense selective pressure to evolve a response that would help avoid a damaging environment, if such an environment exists. Organisms also evolve while adapting - even thriving - in a benign environment (for example, a marine sponge modifies its structure in response to current changes, in order to better absorb and process nutrients). Self-preservation is therefore an almost universal hallmark of life. However, when introduced to a novel threat, many species will have a self-preservation response either too specialised, or not specialised enough, to cope with that particular threat.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} An example is the [[dodo]], which evolved in the absence of natural predators and hence lacked an appropriate, general self-preservation response to heavy predation by humans and rats, showing no fear of them.

==Correlations==
“Existential, psychiatric, social, and, to a lesser degree, physical variables are highly correlated with the will to live”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chochinov | first1 = H. M. | last2 = Hack | first2 = T. | last3 = Hassard | first3 = T. | last4 = Kristjanson | first4 = L. J. | last5 = McClement | first5 = S. | last6 = Harlos | first6 = M. | year = 2005 | title = Understanding the Will to Live in Patients Nearing Death | url = | journal = Psychosomatics | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 7–10 | doi=10.1176/appi.psy.46.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existential issues found to correlate significantly include hopelessness, the desire for death, sense of dignity, and burden to others. Psychiatric issues found to be strongly associated are such as depression, anxiety, and  lack of concentration. Physical issues that showed the strongest associations were appetite and appearance which did not show the same consistent degree of correlation. The four main predictor variables of the will to live changing over time are anxiety, shortness of breath, depression, and sense of well-being&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chochinov | first1 = H. M. | last2 = Tataryn | first2 = D. | last3 = Clinch | first3 = J. J. | last4 = Dudgeon | first4 = D. | year = 1999 | title = Will to Live in the Terminally Ill | url = | journal = The Lancet | volume = 354 | issue = | pages = 816–819 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(99)80011-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; which correlate with the other variable predictors as well.  Social variables and quality of life measures are shown to correlate significantly with the will to live such as support and satisfaction with support from family, friends, and health care providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chochinov | first1 = H. M. | last2 = Hack | first2 = T. | last3 = Hassard | first3 = T. | last4 = Kristjanson | first4 = L. J. | last5 = McClement | first5 = S. | last6 = Harlos | first6 = M. | year = 2005 | title = Understanding the Will to Live in Patients Nearing Death | url = | journal = Psychosomatics | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 7–10 | doi=10.1176/appi.psy.46.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Findings on the will to live have suggested that psychological variables are replaced by physical mediators of variation as death draws nearer. The will to live has also proven to be highly unstable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chochinov | first1 = H. M. | last2 = Tataryn | first2 = D. | last3 = Clinch | first3 = J. J. | last4 = Dudgeon | first4 = D. | year = 1999 | title = Will to Live in the Terminally Ill | url = | journal = The Lancet | volume = 354 | issue = | pages = 816–819 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(99)80011-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Many studies have been conducted on the theory of the will to live.  Among these studies are subject to the difference in gender and the elderly and also in the terminally ill. One study focused on a simple question that asked about rating one’s will to live and presented the findings that elderly participants reporting a stronger will to live and strengthened or stable will to live survived longer in comparison to those with a weak will to live. This study found that women were able to cope with life-threatening situations, but suggested that the participants could not have been stable and requires future replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chochinov | first1 = H. M. | last2 = Hack | first2 = T. | last3 = Hassard | first3 = T. | last4 = Kristjanson | first4 = L. J. | last5 = McClement | first5 = S. | last6 = Harlos | first6 = M. | year = 2005 | title = Understanding the Will to Live in Patients Nearing Death | url = | journal = Psychosomatics | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 7–10 | doi=10.1176/appi.psy.46.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The second study presented the idea of the will to live in the terminally ill specifically cancer patients termed as older. In this study researchers were able to suggest that patients who had tested as having a low sustained will to live died soonest, as opposed to having a moderate level of the will to live, lived the longest while high will to live could affect individuals in any direction. This study needs future replication that can show the effects of will to live in the terminally ill from different diseases and age categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tataryn | first1 = D. | last2 = Chochoniv | first2 = H. M. | year = 2002 | title = Predicting the trajectory of will to live in terminally ill patients | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033318202703642 | journal = Psychosomatics | volume = 43 | issue = 5| pages = 370–377 | doi=10.1176/appi.psy.43.5.370}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other accounts of the will to live exist in many extreme medical cases, where patients have overcome extraordinary odds to survive. The Holocaust has provided many instances of this phenomenon, and is a good example of this as well.&lt;ref&gt;Goldenberg, J. Retrieved from http://www.councilforrelationships.org/resources/goldenberg-survival.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A proposed mechanism for the will to live is the idea that positive mental thinking tends to lower one’s risk for disease and health complications. One study showed that women who thought positively were more likely to carry more antibodies against certain strains of the flu, thus having a stronger immune system than those who were told to think negative thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Goode, E. (2003, September 02). Power of positive thinking may have a health benefit, study says. Retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/02/health/power-of-positive-thinking-may-have-a-health-benefit-study-says.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Powerful examples of humans having a will to live can be seen in death records throughout history showing that people were more likely to die right after a major holiday, such as Christmas and Thanksgiving, and even birthdays, not actually on or before them, but passing shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;Shimizu, M. &amp; Pelham, B.W. (2008). Postponing a date with the Grim Reaper: Ceremonial events and mortality. Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 30(1), 36-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grohol, J. (2009).

'''Women in positions of power''' are women who hold an occupation that gives them great [[authority]], [[Social influence|influence]], and/or [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]]. Historically, [[Power (social and political)|power]] has been distributed among the sexes disparately. Power and powerful positions have most often been associated with men as opposed to women.&lt;ref name=Hartsock&gt;Hartsock, N. (1990). Foucault on power: a theory for women?. Feminism/postmodernism, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[gender equality]] increases, women hold more and more powerful positions, due to policy and [[social reform]].&lt;ref name=Cockburn&gt;Cockburn, C. (1991). In the way of women: Men's resistance to sex equality in organizations (No. 18). Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accurate and proportional representation of women in social systems has been shown to be important to long-lasting success of the system.&lt;ref name="Renyolds"&gt;Reynolds, A. (1999). Women in the Legislatures and Executives of the World. World Politics, 51(4), 547-573.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a study shows that “absence is not merely a sign of disadvantage and disenfranchisement, but the exclusion of women from positions of power also compounds gender stereotypes and retards the pace of equalization".&lt;ref name="Renyolds" /&gt;

==Position of power==
Occupational power refers to power over coworkers in the field. Positions of power can exist in almost any setting, from small scale, unofficial groups or clubs, all the way to the obvious leaders of nations or CEOs of companies. These more official situations are found in many areas, such as government, industry and business, science and academia, the media, and many other sectors.

==Gender as a factor==
Positions of power and gender are very intertwined. As one study pointed out, “Power differences frequently underlie what appear to be gender differences in behavior; as society is currently configured, power and gender are never independent".&lt;ref name="Yoder"&gt;Yoder, J. D., &amp; Kahn, A. S. (1992). Toward a feminist understanding of women and power. Psychology of Women Quarterly, 16(4), 381-388.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, gender relates to power in the different ways power is acquired, used, and manifested. A 1988 journal article summarizes this relation between gender and power: "the idea that women and men differ in power motivation is reinforced by history and culture. In the history of the west, certainly, women have had less access to most forms of power than have men. Many people believe that men are interested in power and getting power while women are not. Others hold that men and women differ in the ways that they establish, maintain and express power".&lt;ref name=Winter&gt;Winter, D. G., &amp; Barenbaum, N. B. (1985). Responsibility and the power motive in women and men. Journal of Personality, 53(2), 335-355.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, studies have shown that increasing women’s participation in leadership positions decreases corruption, as “women are less involved in bribery, and are less likely to condone bribe taking”.&lt;ref name=Swamy&gt;Swamy, A., Knack, S., Lee, Y., &amp; Azfar, O. (2003). Gender and corruption. Democracy, Governance and Growth, edited by Stephen Knack, 191-224.&lt;/ref&gt; A study on gender and corruption from 2000 also found that “cross-country data show that corruption is less severe where women hold a larger share of parliamentary seats and senior positions in the government bureaucracy, and comprise a larger share of the labor force”.&lt;ref name="Swamy"/&gt;

==Other factors==
In addition to the male-female split in the distribution of positions of power, many other factors play a role in who has power. Race, class, sexuality, age, and other factors all play a significant part in who is in control.&lt;ref name=Zweigenhaft&gt;Zweigenhaft, R. L., &amp; Domhoff, G. W. (1998). Diversity in the power elite: Have women and minorities reached the top? (Vol. 670). New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Acker&gt;Acker, J. (2006). Inequality regimes gender, class, and race in organizations. Gender &amp; Society, 20(4), 441-464.&lt;/ref&gt; These factors play in especially when coupled with the gender difference: research from the Journal of the National Association of Social Workers has found that the “double burden of racism and sexism exacts a toll on their mental health and restricts their opportunities”.&lt;ref name=Gutierrez&gt;Gutierrez, L. M. (1990). Working with women of color: An empowerment perspective. Social work, 35(2), 149-153.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, according to another study, "the degree to which a system successfully includes women can indicate a propensity for the system to include other disenfranchised minorities".&lt;ref name="Renyolds"/&gt;

==Traditional roles and stereotypes==
Traditional roles for men and women in most cultures have relegated women to working in the home primarily. This traditional role of fostering and nurturing others ensued from various sources, but the results are a decrease in the value of work done by women and a decreased ability to work outside the home.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;Miller, J. B. (1982). Women and power (Vol. 1). Stone Center for Developmental Services and Studies, Wellesley College.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pleck&gt;Pleck, J. H. (1977). The work-family role system. Social problems, 417-427.&lt;/ref&gt; This is paired with the societal expectation of the woman to take care of the home and family, and with that the lack of male support in the caretaking of the home. This all leads to the expectation that women have responsibilities in the home and often plays a part in occupational sexism.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pleck /&gt;

Other traditional views of women relegate them to certain occupations. The view of women as caretakers of the family extends beyond the familial unit to others. Women have traditionally been seen as caretakers, of both people and other beings and things&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pleck /&gt; However, this caretaker occupation has most often been a subordinate one, under the direction of a superior, usually a man.&lt;ref name=Lorber&gt;Lorber, J. (1984). Women physicians: Careers, status, and power (Vol. 281). New York: Tavistock Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; The example of the vastly female-dominated nurse occupation, 95% women as of the 2000s,&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;Evans, J., &amp; Frank, B. (2003). Contradictions and tensions: Exploring relations of masculinities in the numerically female-dominated nursing profession. The Journal of Men's Studies, 11(3), 277-292.&lt;/ref&gt; reflects this, as it is the doctors that ultimately are in charge and have the power in the nurse-doctor relationship.&lt;ref name="Lorber"/&gt;

Traditional stereotypes of women make them out to be much more emotional and irrational than men, and thus less suited for many important jobs.&lt;ref name=Barrett&gt;Barrett, L. F., Robin, L., Pietromonaco, P. R., &amp; Eyssell, K. M. (1998). Are women the “more emotional” sex? Evidence from emotional experiences in social context. Cognition &amp; Emotion, 12(4), 555-578.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldenberg&gt;Goldenberg, J. L., &amp; Roberts, T. A. (2013). Throughout the history of the sexes, women have been perceived as inferior to men, but also have been elevated to the status of goddesses on earth. We suggest that these para-doxical biases often associated with women can be linked to an existential need to distance humanity from the natural world. The sources of discrimination against women are most commonly associated with their biological nature. For example, women are devalued for be-ing more emotional than men, less rational, physically weaker, and .... Handbook of experimental existential psychology, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been found that while there is some basis to the stereotype, it does not hold true universally under statistical scrutiny.&lt;ref name="Barrett"/&gt; One survey based in South Africa found that "over 30 per cent ... are of the opinion that women are too emotional to be able to handle high level leadership positions";&lt;ref name=Gouws&gt;9.	Gouws, A., &amp; Kotzé, H. (2007). Women in leadership positions in South Africa: The role of values. Politikon, 34(2), 165-185.&lt;/ref&gt; evidently, stereotypes persist and still take effect.

Studies show that "it is common for stereotypical ideas about women's abilities to perform well in leadership positions to inform people's perceptions about women leaders".&lt;ref name=Gouws /&gt;

==Government==
{{further|Women in government}}

For many years and in most regions of the globe, politics had not allowed women to play a significant role in government. Even in the early 1900s, politics were viewed almost exclusively as the domain of men.&lt;ref name=Paxton&gt;Paxton, P., &amp; Hughes, M. M. (2007). Women, politics, and power: A global perspective. Pine Forge Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, women’s movements and culture-changing events such as World War II gradually increased women’s rights and roles in politics.&lt;ref name="Paxton"/&gt; Many factors go into the degree of female participation in governments across the world. One 1999 study found: "[the] electoral system structure, left party government, the timing of women's suffrage, the share of women in professional occupations, and cultural attitudes toward the role of women in politics each play a role in accounting for variation in the degree of gender inequality in political representation around the world”.&lt;ref name=Kenworthy&gt;Kenworthy, L., &amp; Malami, M. (1999). Gender inequality in political representation: A worldwide comparative analysis. Social Forces, 78(1), 235-268.&lt;/ref&gt; Even still, there are many other factors that play a serious role in female participation in government. There is a significant “perceived liability” to a party of having a female candidate for office, according to a 2005 study.&lt;ref name=Kunovich&gt;Kunovich, S., &amp; Paxton, P. (2005). Pathways to Power: The Role of Political Parties in Women’s National Political Representation1. American Journal of Sociology, 111(2), 505-552.&lt;/ref&gt; Even today, no country in the world has 50% or higher female participation in a national legislature, and 73% of countries have less than 20% female participation.&lt;ref name="Paxton"/&gt;

There are multiple levels of power positions in the government from the local level to the national level. Accordingly, there are different degrees to which women partake in these different levels. For example, studies have found in India that "large scale membership of women in local councils" can be more effective in exerting influence, such as over crime rates, than "their presence in higher level leadership positions".&lt;ref name=Iyer&gt;Iyer, L., Mani, A., Mishra, P., &amp; Topalova, P. (2011). The power of political voice: Women’s political representation and crime in India. Harvard Business School BGIE Unit Working Paper, (11-092).&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is important to have women at all levels of government to ensure the representation as well as enacting of women's interests.&lt;ref name="Renyolds"/&gt;

===Voting===
Women were deprived of exercising political power in every country until granted the right to vote. After earning the right to vote, it often took decades for women to turn out to the polls in numbers proportional to their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=Pintor&gt;Pintor, R. L., &amp; Gratschew, M. (2002). Voter turnout since 1945: a global report.&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. today, women are statistically more likely to vote than men,&lt;ref name="Pintor"/&gt; a pattern that occurs in certain countries, such as Scandinavian countries, while the opposite occurs in others, such as India.&lt;ref name="Paxton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pintor"/&gt; Scandinavian countries are also some of the countries with greatest female representation in government positions.&lt;ref name="Paxton"/&gt; Exercising the right to vote is a reflection of the power women feel they have in their political systems.

Today, women are enfranchised in all countries with a legislature other than Saudi Arabia. A 2006 study demonstrated that “although women have the legal right to vote and stand for elections in almost every country of the world, cultural barriers to women’s use of their political rights, including family resistance and illiteracy, remain”.&lt;ref name="Pintor"/&gt;

===Quotas===
Many countries have instituted quotas dictating a minimum number of women to be given elected positions in governments. In general, the quota system has acted as a fast-track to incorporating greater female representation into the governing systems.&lt;ref name=Tripp&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tripp | first1 = Aili M. | last2 = Kang | first2 = Alice | title = The global impact of quotas on the fast track to increased female legislative representation | journal = [[Comparative Political Studies]] | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 338–361 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0010414006297342 | date = March 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0010414006297342 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several countries, such as Rwanda, which have established quota systems successfully have even recently surpassed traditionally highly gender representative countries based on the quota requirements.&lt;ref name=Tripp /&gt; However, there are still flaws to quota systems and there is some controversy over the effectiveness of representation,&lt;ref name=Dahlerup&gt;{{cite book | last = Dahlerup | first = Drude | title = Women, quotas and politics | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780415375498 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tinker&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Tinker | first = Irene | author-link1 = Irene Tinker | title = Quotas for women in elected legislatures: Do they really empower women? | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 27 | issue = 5 | pages = 531–546 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.wsif.2004.09.008 | date = November 2004 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wsif.2004.09.008 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; as some studies have found actual policy change to be limited.&lt;ref name=Dahlerup /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tinker /&gt;

===International organizations===
International bodies such as the UN have established goals for female representation in governing bodies. Thirty percent of elected position seats was recommended as the critical mass necessary to gain effective policy from female representation.&lt;ref name=Tinker /&gt; However, even these international bodies that promote female empowerment on many scales themselves lack proportional gender representation. On Wikipedia’s [[List of current Permanent Representatives to the United Nations]], of the 192 representatives, only 32 are women, which is only 16.67% female, barely over half of what they recommend for governing bodies. Additionally, of these 32 countries represented by women, only three, the [[United States]], [[Singapore]], and [[Luxembourg]], are considered core countries, making women-represented core countries only an even smaller percentage.

==Industry and business==
{{further|Women CEOs of the Fortune 500|Women in business|Gender representation on corporate boards of directors}}

Most top and high-power positions in businesses and companies are held by men{{where|date=May 2014}}.&lt;ref name=Daily&gt;Daily, C. M., Certo, S. T., &amp; Dalton, D. R. (1999). Research notes and communications a decade of corporate women: Some progress in the boardroom, none in the executive suite. Strategic Management Journal, 20(1), 93-99.&lt;/ref&gt; Women currently hold 4.4 percent of Fortune 500 CEO roles and 4.4 percent of Fortune 1000 CEO roles.&lt;ref name=Catalyst&gt;"Women CEOs of the Fortune 1000". Catalyst. Retrieved 4 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown “a consistent difference favoring men in accessibility to, and utility of, resources for power”.&lt;ref name=Ragins&gt;Ragins, B. R., &amp; Sundstrom, E. (1989). Gender and power in organizations: A longitudinal perspective. Psychological bulletin, 105(1), 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, business and industry worldwide still sees a harsh split between the genders in terms of who has control.&lt;ref name="Daily"/&gt;

However, having women in leadership positions can be in the company’s best interests. Studies have found that gender diversity in top-level boards means broader perspectives and opinions, which result in more comprehensive outcomes.&lt;ref name=EuropeanUnion&gt;European Union. European Commission. Women on Boards - Factsheet 1 The Economic Arguments. Web. 25 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/files/womenonboards/factsheet-general-1_en.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; A study on firms in Denmark found that “the proportion of women in top management jobs tends to have positive effects on firm performance, even after controlling for numerous characteristics of the firm and direction of causality”.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, N., Smith, V., &amp; Verner, M. (2006). Do women in top management affect firm performance? A panel study of 2,500 Danish firms. International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management, 55(7), 569-593.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a 2004 study from Bottom Line found that: “Companies with the highest representation of women on their top management teams experienced better financial performance than companies with the lowest women’s representation”.&lt;ref name="The Bottom Line"&gt;"The Bottom Line: Connecting Corporate Performance and Gender Diversity." Catalyst. Equity in Business Leadership, 15 Jan. 2004. Web. 25 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to try to achieve greater gender equality in workplace leadership positions, the European Union established a goal to have 40% women in non-executive board-member positions in publicly listed companies by 2020.&lt;ref name="Women on Boards"&gt;"Women on Boards: Commission Proposes 40% Objective." EUROPA. European Commission, 14 Nov. 2012. Web. 25 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, many pushed for pay equality for women. Unfortunately, this did not lead to greater employment of women in higher roles. New tactics need to be enacted in order to give employers incentives to hire more women, specifically for management and executive roles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Global Workforce Gender Diversity: It’s Not Happening|url = http://www.greatplacetowork.com/publications-and-events/blogs-and-news/2841-global-workforce-gender-diversity-its-not-happening#sthash.WlfdG0Ps.dpbs|website = www.greatplacetowork.com|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Women make up less than 5% of CEOs at Fortune 500 companies, hold less than 25% of management roles, and just less than 19% of board roles globally.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While CEOs of companies are working toward creating more female employees as leaders, the root of the problem is often not addressed. Discrepancies often occur between qualities of leaders and qualities of women as leaders. Once women are respected and given credibility in the workplace, they will have the ability to occupy higher positions. “A significant body of research shows that for women, the subtle gender bias that persists in organizations and in society disrupts the learning cycle at the heart of becoming a leader.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women Rising: The Unseen Barriers|url = https://hbr.org/2013/09/women-rising-the-unseen-barriers|website = Harvard Business Review|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once this bias is rectified, women will be able to gain leadership positions in their companies and/or organizations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===The glass ceiling===
In the workplace, both in the public and private sector, the opportunities available to women are trumped by a [[glass ceiling]]. The glass ceiling is a phenomenon in which women in the workplace, climb the corporate ladder through with qualifications equal to those of their male counterparts only to find that they cannot proceed past a certain point due to  gender stereotypes and their implications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/reich/reports/ceiling2.pdf Dol.gov "A Solid Investment" Retrieved 20 October 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; These gender stereotypes create barriers for women trying to reach positions of power which is responsible for creating and influencing the glass ceiling effect. The glass ceiling most directly affects those women who spend many years working in an industry to build up achievements and a status of credibility in order to be considered for positions of power within the company or industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/reich/reports/ceiling.pdf Dol.gov "Good for Business" Retrieved 20 October 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; Yet despite their competence, women are not offered top CEO positions because of their sex and existing stereotypes that say that women are not cut out to head such big responsibilities.  However, when these women's achievements are ignored and their success halted because of ignorant stereotypes, they are not the only ones affected. Many young women entering the workforce often look up to these driven women and aspire to achieve many of the same dreams. Yet when these young women witness their mentors and idols failing to achieve their dreams because of gender inequality, a culture begins to develop amongst women where they do not feel worthy of power and struggle with self empowerment.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/margiewarrell/2013/08/04/glass-ceiling-or-glass-cage-breaking-through-the-biggest-barrier-holding-women-back/ Forbes.com Retrieved 20 October 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; This is an immense reason why a lot of women do not chase after positions of power because of a lack of self-worth brought on by gender stereotypes and inequalities.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;

The glass ceiling is continuing to effect women today, but with forced attention on gender equality, women will be able to break through this invisible ceiling and effect change in the corporate world. While companies are shifting toward greater gender diversity in the workplace, it is still necessary to identify and rectify why women are not gaining leadership positions, even though equal pay for equal work exists. Evidence shows that organizations who play an active management role in diversity in the workplace have positive results. Active management in diversity has led to pay equity, more flexible schedules, and equal access to advancement opportunity. Using innovation in the workplace and installing unconventional programs has landed success in employing more women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Academia==
In academia as well, much remains to be accomplished in terms of gender equality. Many departments, especially those in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields, are heavily male-dominated.&lt;ref name=Story&gt;Story, M. O. T., &amp; Academia, W. I. (2005). Women faculty make little progress. Education, 83(44), 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women achieve disproportionately less prestige and success in academia than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;Clark, S. M., &amp; Corcoran, M. (1986). Perspectives in the professional socialization of women faculty: A case of accumulative disadvantage?. Journal of Higher Education.&lt;/ref&gt; They are less likely to be tenured and to receive promotions to more influential or powerful positions.&lt;ref name=Winkler&gt;Winkler, J. A. (2000). Focus Section: Women in Geography in the 21st Century: Faculty Reappointment, Tenure, and Promotion: Barriers for Women. The Professional Geographer, 52(4), 737-750.&lt;/ref&gt; Women in academia also earn a lower income, on average, than their male counterparts, even when adjusted.&lt;ref name="Winkler"/&gt; While hiring of women in academic fields has been on a slight rise, it is mainly in entry-level occupations and not for high-level positions where women are most lacking.&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt; Integrating women more thoroughly into academia may be important to developing future gender equality as well as greater research outcomes.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Highly disproportionate prestige and success outcomes in fields that are seen as being male-dominated may be a consequence of gender socialization that funnel women into specific fields, otherwise known as "care" fields, such as teaching.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Other possible explanations include "overt and subtle sex discrimination, differential interests and preferences for teaching rather than research, lack of sponsorship and collegial networks, and others suggesting accumulative disadvantage in the structure of the occupational career."&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;

== Example of success==
According to the Pew Research Center, after extensive research, the key barrier for why women either are not advancing in their careers or are not being viewed as competitors for top positions in companies is because there are “many interruptions related to motherhood that may make it harder for women”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Women and Leadership|url = http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/01/14/women-and-leadership/|website = Pew Research Center|accessdate = 22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forbes provides scenarios that even if women have full-time jobs, they are still the one responsible for any family dilemmas rather than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Marks|first1 = Gene|title = Why Most Women Will Never Become CEO|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/quickerbettertech/2011/10/31/why-most-women-will-never-become-ceo/|website = Forbes|accessdate = 22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; David White argues that men during the 1960s, as implemented in his study, “being the sole provider for the family gave men a significant amount of power in their homes and contributed to feelings of male superiority”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = White|first1 = David|title = Gender Roles in 1950s America|url = http://the-artifice.com/masculinity-gender-roles-tv-1950s/|website = Study.com|accessdate = 22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economics research states that culture can “transmit values and norms that last for centuries and even millennia” and they have “nothing to substantiate them except handed-down beliefs”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Eswaran|first1 = Mukesh|title = Why We Think the Way We Do about Men, Women and Work|url = https://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/the-lasting-impact-of-the-plow-on-our-attitudes-about-gender-and-work/|website = PBS|accessdate = 22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research indicates that one reason women are not advancing in top positions in businesses is because of gender norms that have perpetuated into the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Contemporary examples==

===Africa===
Most countries in Africa leave women without easy avenues to powerful positions in any area. However, there are some exceptions, such as Rwanda. Rwanda, with their new constitution after the conclusion of the Rwandan Civil War, it was written in that 30% of policy-making positions must be allocated to women.&lt;ref name="Paxton"/&gt; In 2003 with the first election of the new constitution, Rwanda surpassed Sweden to be the country with the highest percentage of women in its parliament with 48.8%.&lt;ref name="Paxton"/&gt;

===Nordic countries===
Norway, Sweden, Finland, and other countries in Scandinavia have had long-established parliaments and have gone through a long, slow process of integrating women into power positions. As a result, Sweden is the country with the second highest rate of female participation in government, behind Rwanda.&lt;ref name="Paxton"/&gt;

===Middle East===
The Middle East is home to some of the most female-oppressive countries, such as Saudi Arabia where women are not allowed to vote{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}. However, some countries, especially more liberal ones such as the United Arab Emirates, many women are making progress toward greater power{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}.

===Latin America===
In terms of leadership ratios, Latin America is one of the most progressive regions in the world when it comes to electing women. One fourth of the legislators in Latin America are women; a higher ratio can only be found in Scandinavia. Latin America also has “more female heads of state than any other area of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meade |first1=Teresa |title=A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to Present |date=2016 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |page=10 |edition=2 |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prime example of integration of women into powerful positions in Latin America is Argentina, the first country in the world to adopt a quota system, requiring 15% female participation in the electoral system in 1990.[17]

The presence of women in Argentine government can also be attributed to the Peronist Feminist Party, instituted by Juan Perón and led by his wife Eva. Following the campaigns of this party, 90% of Argentine woman participated in the 1951 election, and seven women won positions in office. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meade |first1=Teresa |title=A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to Present |date=2016 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |page=204 |edition=2 |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, women have not only been elected to small positions. The previous president of Chile, Michelle Bachelet, is one example. She served as president from 2006 to 2010, and was re-elected in 2013. During that three-year intermission, she became the first executive director of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women. During her presidency, she has championed women’s health and other rights and instituted several reforms to address these issues. Her presidency marked a change in the politics of Chile, as well as Latin America as a whole. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meade |first1=Teresa |title=A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to Present |date=2016 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |page=331 |edition=2 |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other historical examples of female heads of state include Isabel Perón (Argentina, 1974-6), Violeta Chamorro (Nicaragua, 1990-7), Mireya Moscoso de Arias (Panama, 1999-2004), Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (Argentina, 2007-2015), Laura Chinchilla (Costa Rica, 2010-14), and Dilma Rousseff (Brazil, 2011-2016). Despite the high numbers of female politicians, little progress has been made on issues such as gender-based income inequality. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meade |first1=Teresa |title=A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to Present |date=2016 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |isbn=978-1-118-77248-5 |page=11 |edition=2 |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
One of the highly significant things and provisions introduced by the new Companies Act of India, is the mandatory inclusion of at least one woman director to the Board of every prescribed class of companies in India. This provision can be considered as revolutionary initiation by the Government of India, for the purposes of empowerment of the women in the Indian Corporate world thereby strengthening and promoting contributions of women to the economic progress of the country.
