An '''addendum''', in general, is an addition required to be made to a document by its author subsequent to its printing or publication. It comes from the [[Latin]] verbal phrase {{lang|la|addendum est}}, being the [[gerundive]] form of the verb {{lang|la|addere}}&lt;ref&gt;Cassell's Latin Dictionary ed. Marchant &amp; Charles&lt;/ref&gt; ({{literal translation|'give toward'|lk=on}}) meaning "(that which) must be added." {{lang|la|Addenda}} is from the plural form {{lang|la|addenda sunt}}, "(those things) which must be added" (see also [[memorandum]], [[Agenda (meeting)|agenda]], [[corrigenda]]).

==Specific uses==

===In books===
An addendum may explain inconsistencies or expand the existing work or otherwise explain or update the information found in the main work, especially if any such problems were detected too late to correct the main work. For example, the main work could have had already been printed and the cost of destroying the batch and reprinting it deemed too high.  As such, addenda may come in many forms — a separate letter included with the work, [[text file]]s on a digital medium, or any similar carrier. It may serve to notify the reader of errors present, as an [[errata]].

===In contracts and other legal documents===
In other documents, most importantly in legal [[contract]]s, an addendum is an additional document not included in the main part of the contract.  It is an ad hoc item, usually compiled and executed after the main document, which contains additional terms, obligations or information.  An Additional Agreement to a contract is often an addendum to a contract.

It is to be distinguished from other appendices to a contract which may contain additional terms, specifications, provisions, standard forms or other information which have been separated out from the main body of the contract.  These are called:
an '''appendix''' (general term),
an '''annex''' (which includes information, usually large texts or tables, which are independent stand-alone works which have been included in the contract, such as a tax table, or a large excerpt from a book), or an '''exhibit''' (often used in court cases),

Similarly an '''attachment''' is used usually for e-mails, while an '''enclosure''' is used with a paper letter.

Addenda are often used in standard form contracts to make changes or add specific detail.  For example, an addendum might be added to a contract to change a date or add details as to delivery of goods or pricing.  The addendum should be referenced in the contract, or the contract should be referenced in the addendum, so that it is clear  which contract the addendum is modifying.

A '''rider''' is often used to add specific detail and especially specific conditions to a ''standard'' contract such as an insurance contract.  A rider may also be added to [[rider (law)|a piece of legislation]].

'''Schedules''' and '''exhibits''' are sub-categories of addenda, with schedules being related to numerical and time information, such as pricing and time-schedules, and exhibits used for examples of standard forms or additional information necessary for the parties to understand and/or comply with their contractual obligations.  Outside of contract law, exhibits are often used in legal documents filed with a court as part of judicial proceedings such as motions, briefs and the submission of different types of evidence for inclusion in the record of trial of a particular case.

===In legal judgments===
Juries in inquests or trials may amplify or explain their decisions by issuing a commentary known as a '''rider''', as in the prosecution of [[Harold Greenwood (solicitor)|Harold Greenwood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Wilson| first = Colin | authorlink = Colin Wilson| title = Encyclopedia of Murder| year = 1984| isbn = 0-330-28300-6 | publisher = [[Pan Books]]| page = 277}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the inquest of [[Jean Charles de Menezes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/3708063/Jean-Charles-de-Menezes-inquest-Jury-reaches-open-verdict.html |title=Jean Charles de Menezes inquest: Jury reaches open verdict - Telegraph |publisher=telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=2010-10-22 |location=London |first1=Richard |last1=Edwards |first2=Gordon |last2=Rayner |date=2008-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In medical transcription===
Addendum is also used if the medical care staff is inserting additional information about the patient.

===In engineering===
{{also|List of gear nomenclature#Addendum{{!}}Addendum in list of gear nomenclature}}
The addendum is the [[radial distance]] from the [[pitch circle]] of a cogwheel, worm wheel, etc., to the crests of the teeth or ridges. This is also the radial height of a tooth above the pitch circle.

[[Burkina Faso]] is a small, landlocked country north of [[Ghana]] and south of [[Mali]] and [[Niger]]. Economically, it is one of the four or five poorest countries in the world. Culturally, it is extremely rich. In part this is because so few people from Burkina have become Muslim or Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, Christopher D. "Countries of Africa: Burkina Faso," Art and Life in Africa, {{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/toc/countries.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115211048/http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/toc/countries.html |archivedate=2014-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the ancient artistic traditions for which Africa is so well known have been preserved in Burkina Faso because so many people continue to honor the ancestral spirits, and the spirits of nature. In great part they honor the spirits through the use of masks and carved figures. Many of the countries to the north of Burkina Faso had become predominantly Muslim, while many of the countries to the south of Burkina Faso are heavily Christian. In contrast many of the people of Burkina Faso continue to offer prayers and sacrifices to the spirits of nature and to the spirits of their ancestors. The result is that they continue to use the sorts of art that we see in museums in Europe and America.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One of the principal obstacles to understanding the art of Burkina Faso, including that of the Bwa, has been a confusion between the styles of the Bwa, "[[gurunsi]]", and [[Mossi people|Mossi]], and a confusion of the [[Bwa people]] with their neighbors to the west the [[Bobo people]]. This confusion was the result of the use by French colonial officers of Jula interpreters at the turn of the century. These interpreters considered the two peoples to be the same and so referred to the Bobo as "Bobo-Fing" and to the Bwa as "Bobo-Oule."  In fact, these two peoples are not related at all. Their languages are quite different, their social systems are quite different, and certainly their art is quite different. In terms of artistic styles the confusion stems from the fact that the Bwa, "gurunsi'" and Mossi make masks that are covered with red white and black geometric graphic patterns. This is simply the style of the Voltaic or Gur peoples, and also includes the [[Dogon people|Dogon]] and other peoples who speak [[Voltaic languages]].&lt;ref name="uiowa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/Bobo_Bwa/index.htm |title=Art &amp;amp; Life in Africa - The University of Iowa Museum of Art |publisher=uiowa.edu |accessdate=2014-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630060732/http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/Bobo_Bwa/index.htm |archivedate=2013-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mossi Masks==
[[File:Wan-pesego Mask by Mossi people, late 19th or early 20th century.jpg|thumb|Mossi Mask, late 19th or early 20th century. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
Masks occupy an important position in the religious life of the [[Nyonyose]], the ancient farmers and spiritual segment of society among the [[Mossi people]]. The Nakomse (chief class) do not use masks. The use of masks in initiations and funerals is quite typical of all the Voltaic or Gur-speaking peoples, including the Nyonyose, Lela, Winiama, Nouna, Bwaba, and Dogon. Masks appear at burials to observe on behalf of the ancestors that proper burial procedures were carried out. They then appear at several funeral or memorial services held at regular intervals over the years after an elder has died. Masks attend to honor the deceased and to verify that the spirit of the deceased merits admission into the world of ancestors. Without a proper funeral the spirit remains near the home and causes trouble for his/her descendants. Masks are often carved of the wood of ''[[Ceiba pentandra]]'', the faux kapokier. They are carved in three major styles that correspond to the styles of the ancient people who were conquered in 1500 by the invading Nakomse and integrated into a new Mossi society: In the north masks are vertical planks with a round concave or convex face.[[File:Mossi mask.jpg|thumb|A mask at a funeral in the village of Kirsi in 1976.  A black plastic child's doll has been added to the horns to create a karan wemba, to honor a female ancestor.]] In the southwest masks represent animals such as antelope, bush buffalo, and various strange creatures, are painted red, white and black. In the east, around Boulsa [3], masks have tall posts above the face to which fiber is attached, . Female masks have two pairs of round mirrors for eyes, [[File:Mossi Zegedeguin 1977 041.jpg|thumb|Two female Mossi masks of the eastern style at a year-end ceremony in the village of Zegedeguin.]] and small masks, representing Yali, "the child" have two vertical horns. All Nyonyose masks are worn with thick costumes made of the fiber of the wild hemp, ''[[Hibiscus cannabinus]]'', In the old days only the northern Nyonyose in Yatenga and Kaya, and the eastern people around Boulsa allowed their masks to be photographed. The people in the southwest forbade photography because it did not conform to the "yaaba soore", the path of the ancestors. Mask characters include Balinga, the Fulani woman, katre, the hyena, nyaka, the small antelope, Wan pelega, the large antelope, and many others. Now, however, masks from all three areas appear at annual public festivals such festivals as [[SIAO]] (Fr. Salon international de l’Artisanat de Ouagadougou), Week of the Culture, and the Atypical Nights of Koudougou (Les Nuits Atypiques de Koudougou). Each Nyonyose family has its own mask, and they are charged with protecting the masks to this day. Masks are very sacred, and are a link to the spirits of ancestors and of nature.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Roy, Christopher D., "Art of the Upper Volta Rivers," 1987, Paris, Chaffin.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bwa==
The Bwa people live in central Burkina Faso. in years past they have been associated erroneously with the Bobo. In fact they are not related to the Bobo and all, and their languages and culture are quite different. The Bwa people speak a language in the voltaic family of languages, while the Bobo speak a language in the Mande family. The confusion was caused in the past by the inability of the French to distinguish between the two people through their Jula interpreters.

The Bwa people are very similar to other peoples in Burkina Faso in their lack of centralized political authority. Traditionally they have no chiefs. In contrast the Mossi people who live just to the east, have a strong system of chiefs and kings. the result is that while the Mossi are conservative and resistant to change, the Bwa are open-minded and receptive to change.

The Bwa produce several different kinds of masks, including leaf masks dedicated to the god named Dwo, [[File:Leaf masks, Bwa village of Boni, 2006.jpg|thumb|Leaf masks, Bwa village of Boni, 2006]] and wooden masks dedicated to the god Lanle.[[File:Bwa masks, village of Dossi, 1985 2.jpg|thumb|right|Bwa masks, village of Dossi, 1985]] The style of the Bwa is well-known to collectors and scholars around the world. These are wooden masks that represent animals, or tall broad plank masks that represent the spirit Lanle. They are covered with red white and black graphic patterns that represent the religious laws that people in the villages must obey if they are to receive God's blessings. These well-known patterns are not decorative, they are graphic patterns in a system of writing that can be read by anyone in the community who has been initiated. They include black-and-white checkerboards, that look like a target, zig-zag patterns that represent the path of the ancestors, X patterns, and crescents.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Masks are used in a variety of different contexts. They appear at funerals of senior elders both male and female. They appear at initiation's when young men and women are taught the meanings of the masks and the importance of the spirits and enter adult village society. They even appear on market days when their performances attract visitors to the local market, where they are likely to spend more cash, plus helping the economy of the community.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Winiama==

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Nunuma of Winiama maskerdansers TMnr 20031580.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[Winiama]] [[African tribal masks|masked]] dancers.]]
The region southwest of the Mossi Plateau is occupied by a number of autochthonous farmer groups that are referred to collectively by the Mossi, and in most studies, as gurunsi. The singular, gurunga, indicates that the word is of Moré origin (a word of the Moré "-ga, -se" class). The peoples that comprise the so-called gurunsi peoples include the Nuna, Nunuma, Léla, Winiama, Sisala, Kaséna, Nankana, and Kusasé who share similar Gur languages. The Léla speak Lélé, the Nuna speak Nuni, the Winiama speak Winien, and the Kaséna speak Kasem. Most peoples in the area consider gurunsi a pejorative form of address, and much prefer to be called by their ethnic name. For this reason I have used the name gurunsiin italics and only as a convenient "handle". I have used the name Nunuma to refer to the Nuna peoples northwest of the Black Volta, and Nuna for those southeast of the river, because these peoples are closely related but produce masks that differ slightly in style. This distinction may or may not be valid historically and ethnographically. [[File:Bwa masks, village of Dossi, 1985.jpg|thumb|Bush buffalo mask of the Ivo family, village of Ouri, 1985]] 

The major producers of masks are the Léla, Nunuma, and Winiama in the north, and the Nuna in the south. The Sisala also once used masks, but they have virtually disappeared. The Léla, Nunuma, Winiama and Nuna have influenced the styles, use and meaning of masks among their Bwa and Mossi neighbors. Masks carved of wood represent bush spirits, or spirits that take animal forms. These animal forms may be more naturalistic among the Nunuma and Nuna or more stylized among the Léla and Winiama. The animals that occur most frequently are the antelope, buffalo, bush pig, hornbill, hyena, and the serpent. Some masks represent spirits that have no recognizable animal form. Whatever type is represented, masks have large round eyes surrounded by concentric circles, a short snout for animal masks, or a large, protuberant mouth for supernatural spirits. They are covered with geometric patterns painted red, white, and black, repainted every year, except among the Winiama. Some masks are surmounted by a tall plank.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Masks represent protective spirits that can take animal forms or can appear as strange beings. These spirits watch over a family, clan or community, and, if the rules for their propitiation are followed correctly, provide for the fertility, health, and prosperity of the owners. Thus the masks provide for the continuity of life in the gurunsi world. Almost any unusual event can justify consultations with a diviner and the carving of a mask to represent the spirit that is responsible. When the owner of a mask dies the mask may be passed on to his son, or it may be retired to the lineage spirit house where it slowly decays. Years later a diviner may prescribe a new mask in the same form, and the old mask is taken to the local smith who produces a replacement. Then, such old masks often are sold on the antiquities market. Masks appear at numerous events throughout the dry season. They dance to drive evil forces away from the community. They participate in the funerals of male and female elders. Every three, five, or seven years, the most sacred masks of the community participate, including young men's initiations and every seven years in sacrifices to ensure the well-being of the village. Masks may appear for special reasons throughout the year. Entertainment masks appear on almost every market day to dance for the crowds of visitors. The sacred wankr masks do not appear at such popular, public performances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Lobi==
The Lobi people live in southwestern Burkina Faso and northern Ivory Coast and Ghana. They are extremely resistant to any sort of centralized political authority. Instead their communities are based on the laws of God. The central character in every Lobi community is the religious specialist named the Thildar.[[File:Lobi artist with a carved stool, 1984.jpg|thumb|Lobi artist with a carved stool, 1984]] This diviner is responsible for communication with the spirits that govern the community and protect members of each family from accidents, disease, violence, and all of the multiple threats people encounter in the harsh environment of West Africa.

The Lobi represent the nature spirits whom they called Thil with figures that can be carved of wood, modeled from clay, or cast in brass. [[File:Shrine in a Lobi home, village of Dako, Burkina Faso.jpg|thumb|right|Shrine in a Lobi home, village of Dako, Burkina Faso]] These figures are called Boteba, and are usually housed in a dark shrine in the most remote space in the back of the family home. Larger clay figures may be kept outside, where because of the material from which they are made they are safe from theft. Brass figures are often worn on the body by members of the family.

Each of these figures displays different gestures or poses, some of them may have two or even three heads, some female figures carry an infant under one arm. These unique features represent the particular talent or power of the spiritual being that they embody. A figure with two heads is twice as quick to recognize threat and to deal with it. A figure with an infant has the power to bring fertility to the women of the family. A figure holding one arm up blocks the entrance of malevolent spirits to the family home.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Bobo==
In much of the literature on African art the group that lives in the area of Bobo-Dioulasso is called Bobo-Fing. These people call themselves Bobo. They speak a [[Mandé language]]. The Bobo number about 110,000 people, with the great majority in Burkina Faso, although the area occupied by the Bobo extends north into Mali. The Bobo are far from homogeneous. They are an ancient amalgamation of several peoples who have assembled around a number of core clans that do not preserve any oral traditions of immigration into the area. Their language and culture are more closely related to those of their Mandé neighbors to the north, the Bamana and Minianka, than to their Voltaic neighbors thegurunsi and Mossi, but they should be thought of as a southern extension of the Mandé people, that live in what is now Burkina Faso, rather than an intrusive Mandé group that has recently penetrated the region. Although over 41% of Bobo lineages claim a foreign origin, they also claim to be autochthonous.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Bobo creator God is called Wuro. He cannot be described and is not represented by sculpture. Bobo [[cosmogonic myths]], wuro da fere, describe the creation of the world by Wuro and the ordering of his creations, which are placed in basic opposing pairs: man/spirits, male/female, village/bush, domesticated/wild, culture/nature, safety/danger, cold/hot, farmer/blacksmith. The balances between forces as they were created by Wuro are precarious, and it is easy for man, through the simplest daily acts, to pollute his world and throw the forces out of balance. Even farming, in which crops are gathered in the bush and brought into the village, can unbalance the precarious equilibrium between culture/nature, village/bush. The following summary describes the relationship between Wuro, man, and the smith.

The Bobo use masks in three major contexts: masks appear at harvest time in annual rites called birewa dâga. Masks participate in the male initiation, named yele dâga, which is their major function. Finally, they participate in the burial (syebi) and the funeral rites (syekwe) of people who have been killed by Dwo, or of the elder priests of Dwo. This is a secondary function, and not all masks of all Bobo clans attend these rites. Masks seem to participate in funerals much more frequently in the Syankoma area in the south, near Bobo-Dioulasso, than in the north.[[File:Southern_Bobo_antelope_mask.jpg|thumb|right|An antelope mask performs at a funeral in the southern Bobo village of Dofigso, Spring, 1985]] Leaf masks representing the initial and universal form of Dwo serve to integrate the individual into human society and to link the community of man with the natural world; fiber masks fix the individual in a social grouping, dedicated to one of the later forms of Dwo. These masks are important agents of socialization. The significance of these lessons is impressed on each new generation in the major institution of initiation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The different levels of knowledge are explained to Bobo boys in several steps spread out over a period of fifteen years. Masks play an essential role in initiation because they reestablish and reinforce the cosmic order created by Wuro, and restore the balance and the rhythms of the natural world and of the community. Each of the new steps in the initiation is punctuated by important ceremonies when the initiates dance with several types of masks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6908">An '''arts council''' is a government or private [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to promoting the [[art]]s; mainly by funding local artists, awarding prizes, and organizing arts events. They often operate at [[Arms-length management organisation|arms-length]] from the government to prevent political interference in their decisions.

'''Bernard Natan''' (born '''Natan Tannenzaft'''; July 14, 1886&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt; – October&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt; 1942) was a [[France|Franco]]-Romanian film entrepreneur, director and actor of the 1920s and 1930s. He was once said by historians to be one of the earliest (if not the earliest) [[pornographic film]] directors and porn stars,&lt;ref name="Waugh"&gt;Waugh, Thomas. ''Hard To Imagine.'' New York: Columbia University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-231-09998-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slade"&gt;Slade, Joseph. "Bernard Natan: France's Legendary Pornographer." ''Journal of Film and Video.'' 45:2–3 (Summer-Fall 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; although there is now considerable doubt about this.&lt;ref name="CairnsDuane" /&gt; Natan certainly worked in  mainstream cinema from his youngest days, working his way up from projectionist and chemist to cinematographer and producer.&lt;ref name="CairnsDuane" /&gt; He eventually acquired the giant French motion picture studio [[Pathé]] in 1929. Pathé collapsed in 1935, and Natan was convicted of fraud. However, he laid the foundation for the modern film industry in France and helped revolutionize film technology around the world.&lt;ref name="Slade" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Natan was born Natan Tannenzaft (possibly Tanenzapf) to [[Jew]]ish parents in [[Iaşi]],&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt; [[Romania]] in 1886. He moved to France in the early 1900s and, despite being a Romanian, volunteered to fight for France in [[World War I]]. In 1909 he married and subsequently had 2 children.&lt;ref name="CairnsDuane"&gt;Cairns, David &amp; Duane, Paul. ''Natan.'' Screenworks, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 he became a [[French nationality law|French citizen]], and at some point changed his name to "Bernard Natan."&lt;ref name="Waugh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Slade" /&gt; His younger brother [[Emile Natan]] also moved to France and became a film producer.{&lt;ref&gt;Rossel-Kirschen and Willems&lt;/ref&gt;}

==Mainstream film career==
Natan worked as a projectionist, film lab chemist, titles designer, cinematographer and producer during his early years in Paris. He was as a publicity [[stringer (journalism)|stringer]] for [[Paramount Pictures]] during the early 1920s. But by 1929, Natan's Rapid Film had become a major film producer and distributor. His reputation was such that in 1924 Natan became a member of the executive committee of the Cinematographic Employers' Federation. By 1926, his film laboratory was highly regarded, he had established a marketing firm, and he built two [[sound stage]]s. Natan was also a film producer, helping finance and produce motion pictures at other studios.&lt;ref name="Rapid-Film"&gt;Willems, Gilles. "Rapid-Film et ses Branches Production." ''Pathé, Premier Empire du Cinéma.'' Jacques Kermabon, ed. Paris: Centre Georges Pompidou, 1994.  {{ISBN|2-85850-793-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Origins"&gt;Willems, Gilles. "Les Origines du Groupe Pathé-Natan et le Modele Americain." ''Vingtième Siècle.'' 46 (April–June 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Takeover of Pathé===
In late February 1929, Bernard Natan acquired the production and exhibition businesses of Pathé, then the largest French motion picture company. He agreed to merge his own studio, Rapid Film (then worth 25 million [[French franc|francs]]), with Pathé in exchange for 50 million francs in shares. The remaining shares were purchased with funding from a consortium of banks, bonds (to be paid with income from Pathé), and a 10 percent ownership in Pathé by the banks. After the merger, Natan renamed the company Pathé-Natan (sometimes also credited as Pathé-Cinéma).&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rooster"&gt;Abel, Richard. ''The Red Rooster Scare: Making Cinema American, 1900–1910.'' Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-520-21478-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstWave"&gt;Abel, Richard. ''French Cinema: The First Wave 1915–1929.'' Paperback ed. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1987. {{ISBN|0-691-00813-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pathé was already in substantial financial trouble when Natan took control. Studio founder [[Charles Pathé]] had been selling assets for several years to boost investor value and keep the studio's cash flow healthy. The company's founder had even sold Pathé's name and "rooster" trademark to other companies in return for a mere 2 percent of revenues generated by them. Natan had the bad luck to take charge of the studio just as the [[Great Depression]] convulsed the French economy.&lt;ref name="Rooster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstWave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History"&gt;Willems, Gilles. "Les origines de Pathé-Natan." In ''Une Histoire Économique du Cinéma Français (1895–1995), Regards Croisés Franco-Américains.'' Pierre-Jean Benghozi and Christian Delage, eds. Paris: Harmattan, Collection Champs Visuels, 1997. English translation available at [http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/classics/rr1199/gwrr8b.htm http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/classics/rr1199/gwrr8b.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109223643/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/classics/rr1199/gwrr8b.htm |date=January 9, 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Natan attempted to steady Pathé's finances and implement modern film industry practices at the studio. Natan acquired another film studio, [[Société des Cinéromans]], from [[Arthur Bernède]] and [[Gaston Leroux]], which enabled Pathé to expand into projector and electronics manufacturing. He also bought the Fornier chain of motion picture theaters and rapidly expanded the chain's nationwide presence.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rooster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstWave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; The French press, however, attacked Natan mercilessly for his stewardship of Pathé. Many of these attacks were [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] and contained veiled [[homophobia|homophobic]] allusions to Natan's supposed sexuality.&lt;ref name="Slade" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

Pathé-Natan did well under Natan's guidance. Between 1930 and 1935, despite the world economic crisis, the company made 100 million [[French franc|francs]] in profits, and produced and released more than 60 feature films (just as many films as major American studios produced at the time). He resumed production of the newsreel [[Pathé News]], which had not been produced since 1927.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

Natan also invested heavily into research and development to expand Pathe's film business. In 1929, he pushed Pathé into [[sound film]]. In September, the studio produced its first sound feature film, and its first sound newsreel a month later. Natan also launched two new cinema-related magazines, ''Pathé-Revue'' and ''Actualités Féminines'', to help market Pathé's films and build consumer demand for cinema. Under Natan, Pathé also funded the research of [[Henri Chrétien]], who developed the [[anamorphic format|anamorphic lens]] (a technology which later led to the creation of [[CinemaScope]] and other [[widescreen]] film formats common today).&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rooster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstWave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

Natan expanded Pathé's business interests into communications industries other than film. In November 1929, Natan established France's first television company, Télévision-[[John Logie Baird|Baird]]-Natan. A year later, he purchased a radio station in Paris and formed a holding company (Radio-Natan-Vitus) to run what would become a burgeoning radio empire.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rooster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstWave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

===Collapse of Pathé and imprisonment===
In 1935, Pathé went bankrupt. In order to finance the company's continued expansion, Pathé's board of directors (which still included Charles Pathé) voted in 1930 to issue shares worth 105 million francs. But with the depression deepening, only 50 percent of the shares were purchased. One of the investor banks collapsed due to financial difficulties unrelated to Pathé's problems, and Pathé was forced to follow through with the purchase of several movie theater chains it no longer could afford to buy. Although the company continued to make a profit (as noted above) for a time, it soon began to lose more money than it could bring in.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rooster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstWave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

The collapse of Pathé led French authorities to indict Bernard Natan on charges of fraud. Natan was accused of financing the purchase of the company without any collateral, of bilking investors by establishing fictitious [[shell corporation]]s, and negligent financial mismanagement. Natan was even accused of hiding his Romanian and Jewish heritage by changing his name. Natan was indicted and imprisoned in 1939. This meant he was in prison when France fell to the Nazis, while most other major Jewish filmmakers were able to flee the country or go into hiding. A second indictment was brought in 1941, and he was convicted shortly thereafter. His French citizenship was taken away, which required special legal manovres by the state, since he had been naturalized as a result of his WWI military servie and there was no existing legal means to render him stateless. He was transferred from prison in September 1942 to the [[Drancy internment camp|camp at Drancy]], and shortly afterwards deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rooster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstWave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

==Adult film controversy==
In 1911, Natan and colleagues were convicted of making erotic films, he was jailed for a short time and fined 1,000 francs but due to his exceptional record fighting in World War I this was later removed from his record.&lt;ref name="CairnsDuane" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rossel-Kirschen and Willems, p. 168-169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources have claimed that Natan's career in pornography did not end there. Joseph Slade suggests that Natan may have directed at least one [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] pornographic film in Romania&lt;ref name="Waugh" /&gt; and produced and acted in at least 20 hardcore [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] and [[bisexual]] films between 1920 and 1927.&lt;ref name="Trumpbour"&gt;Trumpbour, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Slade wrote that nearly all French pornographic films from this period which include bisexual and homosexual content were produced by Natan. The same source states that Natan himself was bisexual,&lt;ref name="Waugh"/&gt; and engaged in intercourse in ''[[Le Menage Moderne Du Madame Butterfly]]'' (1920) and ''La Maîtresse du Capitaine de Meydeux'' (1924). Furthermore, Slade claimed that he introduced [[Sadomasochism|masochism]] into French pornographic film.&lt;ref name="Slade"/&gt;

Slade's claims are disputed by the historians of the French organization "Les Indépendants du Premier Siècle", who argue that the various actors in question are not Natan and that accusations at Natan's trial and in [[Paris-Match]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hutchinson |first=Pamela |date=14 December 2015 |title=In need of rehabilitation: Bernard Natan, the Holocaust victim who saved France's film industry |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/dec/14/bernard-natan-pathe-cinema-holocaust-victim-france-film-industry |location=The Guardian |access-date=24 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; connecting him to the adult film industry were false.&lt;ref&gt;Rossel-Kirschen, André and Willems, Gilles. "Bernard Natan à la direction de Pathé-Cinéma." ''1895''. 21 (December 1996). Paris: AFRHC (association française pour l'Histoire du cinéma).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lips.org/bio_natan.%20reponse_%C3%A0_Slade.asp Droit de réponse Mise au point Sur le grand producteur Bernard Natan], LIPS.org,&lt;/ref&gt; ''Natan'', a 2013 documentary film, compares stills from the adult films attributed to Natan with official headshots and shows that several pornographic actors have been mistaken for Natan but are not him.&lt;ref name="CairnsDuane" /&gt; Joseph Slade now admits there is room for doubt over whether Natan worked in pornography at any time after 1910.&lt;ref name="CairnsDuane" /&gt;

==Death==
[[World War II]] broke out while Natan was in prison awaiting trial, and [[Nazi Germany]] conquered France. After Natan's release from prison, the French government handed him over to the [[Occupation of France by Nazi Germany|occupying German authorities]]. Natan was sent to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] on September 25, 1942,&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt; where it is believed he died in 1943.&lt;ref name="CairnsDuane" /&gt;

==Importance to the film industry==
Bernard Natan's importance to the French film industry should not be underestimated. He pioneered the [[vertical integration]] of the French film industry, and adopted the "American model" of film-making and distribution. This model provides the underpinning of the French film industry even in the 21st century. Indeed, Pathé survived into the 1980s almost solely on revenues generated by the companies purchased and integration instituted by Bernard Natan.&lt;ref name="Rapid-Film" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;

Natan also brought television to France, and established the first French radio holding and television companies.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rooster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstWave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

Under Natan's leadership, the anamorphic film camera lens was developed. The anamorphic lens was not only a major advance in film technology, but helped [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] survive during the early years of television.&lt;ref&gt;Bordwell, David and Thompson, Kristin.

''How to Read a Film: The Art, Technology, Language, History and Theory of Film and Media.'' Rev. ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 1981. {{ISBN|0-19-502806-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently there was no public acknowledgement of Natan at La Fémis, the French national film school, which is housed in one of his former studios. A plaque commemorating his work, and his death in Auschwitz in 1942, was unveiled in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hutchinson |first=Pamela |date=14 December 2015 |title=In need of rehabilitation: Bernard Natan, the Holocaust victim who saved France's film industry |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/dec/14/bernard-natan-pathe-cinema-holocaust-victim-france-film-industry |location=The Guardian |access-date=24 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1999 Matthews lecture at [[Birkbeck College]], [[Tom Shippey]] discussed bibliophobia in the [[Middle Ages]].  This arose when the literate professions, such as the clergy and [[beadle]]s, would exploit and terrify the [[illiterate]] masses by their command of texts such as religious and legal documents.  He illustrated this with examples from Anglo-Saxon literature such as ''[[The Pardoner's Tale]]''.&lt;ref name=TS&gt;{{citation |title=Bibliophobia: hatred of the book in the Middle Ages |first=Tom |last=Shippey |authorlink=Tom Shippey |publisher=Birkbeck College |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1485">A '''book rhyme''' is a short [[poem]] or [[rhyme]] that was formerly printed inside the front of a book or on the flyleaf to discourage [[theft]] or to indicate ownership.

Book rhymes were fairly common in the [[United States]] during the 18th and 19th centuries, but the printing of [[bookplate]]s pushed them out of use.

==Anti-theft warnings==
One of the most common is:
&lt;poem&gt;If this book you steal away,
What will you say
On Judgment Day?&lt;/poem&gt;

==Identification rhyme==
&lt;poem&gt;''Everytown is my dwelling-place''
''America is my nation''
''John Smith is my name''&lt;/poem&gt;

The end line has several variations,
&lt;poem&gt;''And Christ is my salvation''
''And heaven my expectation''&lt;/poem&gt;

The title of [[Thornton Wilder]]'s novel "Heaven's My Destination" and [[Alfred Bester]]'s novel ''[[The Stars My Destination]]'' play on the final line.

A typical example of a book rhyme features prominently in [[M. R. James|M.R. James']] ghost story ''[[A Warning to the Curious]]'':

&lt;poem&gt;''Nathaniel Ager is my name and England is my nation,
''Seaburgh is my dwelling-place and Christ is my salvation,''
''When I am dead and in my Grave, and all my bones are rotton,''
''I hope the Lord will think on me when I am long forgotton.''&lt;/poem&gt;

'''Brain Cell''' is a [[mail art]] project begun by [[Ryosuke Cohen]] in June 1985.  The project is a networked art project where individual artists contribute stamps, stickers, drawings or other images.  These are sent through the mail to Cohen, who assembles and prints them as part of each cell.  He prints 150 copies (30 x 42&amp;nbsp;cm)  with a small silkscreen system called a [[Cyclostyle (copier)|Cyclostyle]] (now out of production).  Each participant is mailed a Brain Cell print along with a documentation list of contributors worldwide.

Cohen keeps a copy for himself. Some of the remaining Brain Cell prints from each edition are assembled into sets of 30 consecutive editions.  These set are sent to artists and Mail Art shows around the world.

Cohen also uses Brain Cell prints in the [[Fractal Portrait Project]] (another long running art series by Cohen) and as additions to Mail Art Add and Pass pages.

New Brain Cell editions are published every eight to ten days. More than nine hundred editions have been published.

Cohen described the origin of the project's name in 1985: "Well, I'll title my work 'Brain Cell', because the structure of a brain through a microscope looks like the diagram of the Mail Art network. Thousands of Neurons clung and piled up together are just like the Mail Art network, I believe."

Brain Cell is an art experiment in the vein of networked [[mail art]], where a network expands from A, copied, forwarded and even returned to the originator. This produces a series of cybernetic cells, which can interact in a non-linear order. Brain Cell enlisted over 6,000 contributors from 80 nations between 1985 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Art for Networks, 2002. Edited by Simon Pope and Hannah Firth. Chapter Arts, Cardiff&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British Paraorchestra''', based in Bristol, is an [[orchestra]] consisting entirely of musicians with [[disability|disabilities]]{{emdash}}the first ever orchestra of its kind in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=telegraph-paraorchestra/&gt; The Paraorchestra was formed by conductor [[Charles Hazlewood]] in 2011 as a project to create a platform for the top disabled musicians, with the hope that its success would lead to better [[Community integration|integration]] of the disabled into music and [[performing arts]]. The orchestra performed its first live show at [[Glastonbury Abbey]] in July 2012 (which was also the subject of a [[Channel 4]] documentary), and received international attention when it played alongside [[Coldplay]] during the [[2012 Summer Paralympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]] of the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]] in [[London]] in September 2012.

==History==

===Origins===
Charles Hazlewood was inspired by his youngest daughter Eliza to form the Paraorchestra; Eliza has [[cerebral palsy]], but Hazlewood believed that she was still an "outstanding" singer. Being the father of a child with a disability, he realized that throughout his career as an orchestral conductor, he had seen few disabled performers as members of orchestras. Hazlewood felt that since music is "universal", an orchestra should represent all members of a community{{emdash}}comparing this ordeal to the time when only men performed in orchestras. He felt that an orchestra consisting only of disabled performers could spread awareness of this issue and help achieve greater [[Community integration|integration]] for the disabled in music and the performing arts.&lt;ref name=nat-para/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-paraorchestra&gt;{{cite news|title=Coldplay join the paraorchestra of disabled musicians for closing ceremony|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/01/orchestra-disabled-people-play-paralympics?newsfeed=true|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=11 September 2012|location=London|first=Maggie|last=Brown|date=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation===
Hazlewood officially announced the formation of the British Paraorchestra in July 2011 at a [[TED (conference)|TED conference]] in [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=nat-para/&gt; He did not intend the Paraorchestra to be a [[Music therapy|therapeutic]] or "warm and fuzzy" project, but rather a platform to showcase disabled musicians with [[virtuoso|virtuosic]] qualities. When holding auditions, he aimed to find musicians who were "at the top of their game, technically, and with a spirit behind the virtuosity." The orchestra's first 17 members come from a variety of backgrounds and use a variety of instruments, including conventional instruments and electronic devices such as [[tablet computer]]s and other assistive technology developed by [[Rolf Gehlhaar]], Professor in Experimental Music at Coventry University and the technical director of the orchestra.&lt;ref name=guardian-paraorchestra/&gt; After failing to partner with the [[BBC]], Hazlewood successfully commissioned British broadcaster [[Channel 4]] to produce a documentary following the formation of the Paraorchestra and its first performance, which aired on 9 September 2012. He felt airing its documentary on Channel 4 was a "no-brainer", as it was also the official broadcaster of the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]].&lt;ref name=guardian-paraorchestra/&gt; 

The Paraorchestra made its first public appearance on 1 July 2012 during Hazlewood's music festival "Orchestra in a Field" at [[Glastonbury Abbey]]; the performance included its versions of "[[Greensleeves]]" and [[Maurice Ravel]]'s ''[[Boléro]]''.&lt;ref name=guardian-paraorchestra/&gt; The orchestra's style incorporates a large amount of [[Musical improvisation|improvisation]], intended to allow the orchestra to feel a sense of "collective ownership" of their performances.&lt;ref name=nat-para&gt;{{cite web|last=Champ|first=Gemma|title=The British Paraorchestra hit the right notes|url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/on-stage/the-british-paraorchestra-hit-the-right-notes|publisher=The National|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Involvement with the Paralympics===
In 2012, Hazlewood campaigned for the Paraorchestra to be included in the ceremonies of the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]] in London. He felt that their inclusion in this international event would be a unique opportunity for the Paraorchestra and that it could also raise awareness of his cause.&lt;ref name=guardian-paraorchestra/&gt; The Paraorchestra were ultimately incorporated into the [[2012 Summer Paralympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]] of the Games, where it performed alongside British rock band [[Coldplay]] (accompanying them in a performance of "[[Strawberry Swing]]"), and played the [[Paralympic anthem]].&lt;ref name=guardian-paraorchestra/&gt; The Paraorchestra planned to use the exposure it gained through its role at the Paralympics to add more performers, make [[studio recording]]s, and tour across Europe.&lt;ref name=guardian-paraorchestra/&gt;

On 3 December 2012, coinciding with the [[United Nations]]' [[United Nations' International Day of Persons with Disabilities|International Day of Persons with Disabilities]], the British Paraorchestra released a cover of "[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|True Colors]]" as a [[charity single]], in a campaign to be [[List of UK Singles Chart Christmas number ones|Christmas number one]]. Accompanied by the [[Kaos Signing Choir for Deaf and Hearing Children]] and notable Britiah paralympians, the single was released to support the [[British Paralympic Association]] in preparation for the [[2014 Winter Paralympics]], along with the Paraorchestra and Kaos Signing Choir themselves.&lt;ref name=ipc-truecolors&gt;{{cite web|title=British Paraorchestra heads for No. 1 this Christmas|url=http://www.paralympic.org/news/british-paraorchestra-heads-no-1-christmas|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paraorchestra was awarded a [[Big Society Award]] in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=British Paraorchestra win Prime Minister's Big Society Award |url=http://www.classicfm.com/music-news/latest-news/british-paraorchestra-big-society-award/ |newspaper=Classic FM |location= |date=26 September 2013 |access-date=29 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==
The Paraorchestra began with 17 members, but plans to add more in the near future.&lt;ref name=guardian-paraorchestra/&gt; Its members currently include [[Nicholas McCarthy (pianist)|Nicholas McCarthy]], a one-handed pianist who graduated from the [[Royal College of Music]] in 2012, [[Clarence Adoo]], a former jazz trumpet player who was paralysed below the shoulders after a car accident (and now plays an instrument known as "Headspace", which is controlled by breath and head motions, developed for him by [[Rolf Gehlhaar]]), [[Gemma Lunt]], a [[viola]] player who uses a [[wheelchair]] and [[Lyn Levett]], who uses a [[Macintosh]] to play what Hazlewood feels is "dizzyingly creative" [[electronic music]].&lt;ref name=telegraph-paraorchestra&gt;{{cite news|title=One-handed pianist Nicholas McCarthy graduates from Royal College of Music|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/9503659/One-handed-pianist-Nicholas-McCarthy-graduates-from-Royal-College-of-Music.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=10 September 2012|location=London|first=Donna|last=Bowater|date=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blind members of the Paraorchestra include Pianist and violinist [[Abi Baker]], [[James Risdon]] on [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], [[Matthew Wadsworth]] on the [[lute]], violist [[Takashi Kikuchi]], and multi-instrumentalists [[Baluji Shrivastav]] and [[Ziad Sinno]].&lt;ref name=nat-para/&gt; The Paraorchestra also recently added 15-year-old [[deafness|deaf]] [[viola]] player Tilly Chester to its lineup.

'''Building material''' is any material which is used for [[construction]] purposes.  Many naturally occurring substances, such as [[clay]], rocks, [[sand]], and [[wood]], even twigs and leaves, have been used to construct [[building]]s. Apart from naturally occurring materials, many man-made products are in use, some more and some less synthetic. The manufacturing of building materials is an established industry in many countries and the use of these materials is typically segmented into specific specialty trades, such as [[carpentry]], [[Building insulation|insulation]], [[plumbing]], and [[roofing material|roofing]] work. They provide the make-up of [[:Category:Human habitats|habitats]] and [[architecture|structures]] including [[home]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"building" def. 2 and 4, "material" def. 1. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0)© Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==The total cost of building materials==
{{expand section|date=April 2014}}
In history there are trends in building materials from being natural to becoming more man-made and [[Composite material|composite]]; biodegradable to imperishable; indigenous (local) to being transported globally; repairable to disposable; chosen for increased levels of fire-safety, and improved [[seismic]] resistance.. These trends tend to increase the ''initial'' and ''long term'' economic, ecological, energy, and social costs of building materials.

===Economic costs===
Initial economic cost of building materials is the purchase price. This is often what governs decision making about what materials to use. Sometimes people take into consideration the energy savings or durability of the materials and see the value of paying a higher initial cost in return for a lower lifetime cost. For example, an asphalt shingle roof costs less than a metal roof to install, but the metal roof will last longer so the lifetime cost is less per year. Some materials may require more care than others, maintaining costs specific to some materials may also influence the final decision. Risks when considering lifetime cost of a material is if the building is damaged such as by fire or wind, or if the material is not as durable as advertised. The cost of materials should be taken into consideration to bear the risk to buy combustive materials to enlarge the lifetime. It is said that, 'if it must be done, it must be done well'.

===Ecological costs===
{{main|Ecological footprint}}
Pollution costs can be macro and micro. The macro, environmental pollution of extraction industries building materials rely on such as mining, petroleum, and logging produce environmental damage at their source and in transportation of the raw materials, manufacturing, transportation of the products, retailing, and installation. An example of the micro aspect of pollution is the off-gassing of the building materials in the building or [[indoor air pollution]]. [[Red List building materials]] are materials found to be harmful. Also the [[carbon footprint]], the total set of greenhouse gas emissions produced in the life of the material. A [[life-cycle analysis]] also includes the [[Deconstruction (building)|reuse]], recycling, or disposal of [[construction waste]]. Two concepts in building which account for the [[ecological economics]] of building materials are [[green building]] and [[sustainable development]].

===Energy costs===
the Initial energy costs include the amount of energy consumed to produce, deliver and install the material. The long term energy cost is the economic, ecological, and social costs of continuing to produce and deliver energy to the building for its use, maintenance, and eventual removal. The initial [[embodied energy]] of a structure is the energy consumed to extract, manufacture, deliver, install, the materials. The lifetime embodied energy continues to grow with the use, maintenance, and reuse/recycling/disposal of the building materials themselves ''and'' how the materials and design help minimize the life-time energy consumption of the structure.

===Social costs===
Social costs are injury and health of the people producing and transporting the materials and potential health problems of the building occupants if there are problems with the [[building biology]]. Globalization has had significant impacts on people both in terms of jobs, skills, and self-sufficiency are lost when manufacturing facilities are closed and the cultural aspects of where new facilities are opened. Aspects of [[fair trade]] and [[labor rights]] are social costs of global building material manufacturing.

==Naturally occurring substances==

===Brush===
[[File:View of a group of Mohaves in a brush hut, one man very emaciated, entitled, by Wittick, Ben, 1845-1903.jpg|thumb|A group of [[Mohave people|Mohaves]] in a brush hut]]
[[Branches|Brush]] structures are built entirely from plant parts and were used in primitive cultures such as Native Americans and &lt;ref&gt;Nabokov, Peter, and Robert Easton. ''Native American architecture''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1989. 16. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[pygmy peoples]] in Africa&lt;ref&gt;Kent, Susan. ''Domestic architecture and the use of space: an interdisciplinary cross-cultural study''. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1990. 131.Print.&lt;/ref&gt; These are built mostly with branches, twigs and leaves, and bark, similar to a [[beaver]]'s lodge. These were variously named [[wikiup]]s, lean-tos, and so forth.

An extension on the brush building idea is the [[wattle and daub]] process in which clay soils or [[feces|dung]], usually [[cow]], are used to fill in and cover a woven brush structure. This gives the structure more thermal mass and strength. Wattle and daub is one of the oldest building techniques.&lt;ref name=Shaffer&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shaffer |first=Gary D. |title=An Archaeomagnetic Study of a Wattle and Daub Building Collapse |journal=Journal of Field Archaeology |volume=20 |number=1 |date=Spring 1993 |pages=59–75 |jstor=530354}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many older timber frame buildings incorporate wattle and daub as non load bearing walls between the timber frames.

===Ice and snow===
Snow and occasionally ice,&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, G. F.. ''The private journal of Captain G.F. Lyon, of H.M.S. Hecla, during the recent voyage of discovery under Captain Parry'' .... London: J. Murray, 1824. 280–281. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; were used by the [[Inuit]] peoples for [[igloo]]s and snow is used to build a shelter called a [[quinzhee]]. Ice has also been used for [[ice hotel]]s as a [[tourist attraction]] in northern climates.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Colin Michael, and Jarkko Saarinen. ''Tourism and change in polar regions: climate, environments and experiences''. Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon, England: Routledge, 2010. 30. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mud and clay===
[[File:SkogarMuseumOutside.jpg|thumb|Sod buildings in Iceland]]

Clay based buildings usually come in two distinct types. One being when the walls are made directly with the mud mixture, and the other being walls built by stacking air-dried building blocks called [[Mudbrick|mud bricks]].

Other uses of clay in building is combined with straws to create [[light clay]], [[wattle and daub]], and mud [[plaster]].

====Wet-laid clay walls====
{{Main|rammed earth|sod|cob (building)}}
Wet-laid, or damp, walls are made by using the mud or clay mixture directly without forming blocks and drying them first. The amount of and type of each material in the mixture used leads to different styles of buildings. The deciding factor is usually connected with the quality of the [[soil]] being used. Larger amounts of [[clay]] are usually employed in building with ''cob'', while low-clay soil is usually associated with ''[[sod house]]'' or ''[[sod roof]]'' construction. The other main ingredients include more or less [[sand]]/[[gravel]] and [[straw]]/grasses. ''Rammed earth'' is both an old and newer take on creating walls, once made by compacting clay soils between planks by hand; nowadays [[formwork|forms]] and [[machine|mechanical]] [[pneumatic]] compressors are used.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;McHenry, Paul Graham. ''Adobe and rammed earth buildings: design and construction''. New York: Wiley, 1984. 104. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil, and especially clay, provides good [[thermal mass]]; it is very good at keeping temperatures at a constant level. Homes built with earth tend to be naturally cool in the summer heat and warm in cold weather. Clay holds heat or cold, releasing it over a period of time like stone. Earthen walls change temperature slowly, so artificially raising or lowering the temperature can use more resources than in say a wood built house, but the heat/coolness stays longer.&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt;

People building with mostly dirt and clay, such as cob, sod, and adobe, created homes that have been built for centuries in western and northern Europe, Asia, as well as the rest of the world, and continue to be built, though on a smaller scale. Some of these buildings have remained habitable for hundreds of years.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael G. "Cob Building, Ancient and Modern," in Kennedy, Smith and Wanek, (2002), 132–133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100416132054/http://www.takungpao.com/news/10/01/28/_IN-1208245.htm] Earliest Chinese building brick appeared in Xi'an (中國最早磚類建材在西安現身)]. takungpao.com (2010-1-28)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Structural clay blocks and bricks====
{{Main|adobe|mudbrick|compressed earth block}}

''Mud-bricks'', also known by their Spanish name ''adobe'' are ancient building materials with evidence dating back thousands of years BC. ''Compressed earth blocks'' are a more modern type of brick used for building more frequently in [[industrialized society]] since the building blocks can be manufactured off site in a centralized location at a [[brickworks]] and transported to multiple building locations. These blocks can also be monetized more easily and sold.

Structural mud bricks are almost always made using clay, often clay soil and a binder are the only ingredients used, but other ingredients can include sand, lime, concrete, stone and other [[Binder (material)|binders]]. The formed or compressed block is then air dried and can be laid dry or with a mortar or [[clay slip]].

===Sand===
Sand is used with [[cement]], and sometimes [[Lime (material)|lime]], to make [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] for [[masonry]] work and [[plaster]]. Sand is also used as a part of the concrete mix. An important low-cost building material in countries with high sand content soils is the [[Sandcrete]] block, which is weaker but cheaper than fired clay bricks.&lt;ref&gt;Zoya Kpamma, Z. Mohammed Kamil, K. Adinkrah-Appiah, "Making Wall Construction Process Lean:The Interlocking Blocksystem as a Toole" [sic], International Conference on Infrastructural Development In Africa (ICIDA), KNUST, Kumasi, Ghana, March 2012. https://www.academia.edu/2647016/MAKING_WALL_CONSTRUCTION_PROCESS_LEAN_THE_INTERLOCKING_BLOCK_SYSTEM_AS_A_TOOL accessed 12/11/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stone or rock ===
Rock structures have existed for as long as history can recall. It is the longest lasting building material available, and is usually readily available. There are many types of rock throughout the world, all with differing attributes that make them better or worse for particular uses. Rock is a very dense material so it gives a lot of protection too; its main drawback as a material is its weight and awkwardness. Its [[energy density]] is also considered a big drawback, as stone is hard to keep warm without using large amounts of heating resources.

[[Dry-stone wall]]s have been built for as long as humans have put one stone on top of another. Eventually, different forms of [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] were used to hold the stones together, cement being the most commonplace now.

The [[granite]]-strewn uplands of [[Dartmoor]] National Park, United Kingdom, for example, provided ample resources for early settlers. Circular huts were constructed from loose granite rocks throughout the [[Neolithic]] and early [[Bronze Age]], and the remains of an estimated 5,000 can still be seen today. Granite continued to be used throughout the [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] period (see [[Dartmoor longhouse]]) and into modern times. [[Slate]] is another stone type, commonly used as roofing material in the United Kingdom and other parts of the world where it is found.

[[Rock (geology)|Stone]] buildings can be seen in most major cities; some civilizations built entirely with stone such as the Egyptian and Aztec [[pyramids]] and the structures of the [[Inca]] civilization.

===Thatch===
[[File:Toda Hut.JPG|thumb|right|Toda tribe hut]]
[[Thatch]] is one of the oldest of building materials known, Thatch is another word for grass; grass is a good insulator and easily harvested. Many African tribes have lived in homes made completely of grasses and sand year-round. In Europe, thatch roofs on homes were once prevalent but the material fell out of favor as industrialization and improved transport increased the availability of other materials. Today, though, the practice is undergoing a revival. In the Netherlands, for instance, many new buildings have thatched roofs with special ridge tiles on top.

=== Wood and timber ===
[[File:Wood-framed house.jpg|thumb|A wood-framed house under construction in Texas, United States]]
[[File:Gliwice-radiostacja.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The [[Gliwice Radio Tower]] (the second tallest wooden structure in the world) in [[Poland]] (2012).]]

[[Wood]] has been used as a building material for thousands of years in its natural state. Today, [[engineered wood]] is becoming very common in industrialized countries.

Wood is a product of [[tree]]s, and sometimes other [[natural fiber|fibrous]] plants, used for construction purposes when cut or pressed into lumber and timber, such as boards, planks and similar materials.  It is a  generic building material and is used in building just about any type of structure in most climates.  Wood can be very flexible under loads, keeping strength while bending, and is incredibly strong when compressed vertically. There are many differing qualities to the different types of wood, even among same tree species. This means specific species are better suited for various uses than others. And [[forest management|growing conditions]] are important for deciding quality.

"Timber" is the term used for construction purposes except the term "lumber" is used in the United States. Raw wood (a log, trunk, bole) becomes timber when the wood has been "converted" (sawn, hewn, split) in the forms of [[Log cabin|minimally-processed logs stacked on top of each other]], [[timber frame]] construction, and [[Framing (construction)|light-frame construction]].  The main problems with timber structures are [[fire risk]] and moisture-related problems.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In modern times [[softwood]] is used as a lower-value bulk material, whereas [[hardwood]] is usually used for finishings and furniture. Historically timber frame structures were built with oak in western Europe, recently [[douglas fir]] has become the most popular wood for most types of structural building.

Many families or communities, in rural areas, have a personal [[woodlot]] from which the family or community will grow and harvest trees to build with or sell. These lots are tended to like a garden. This was much more prevalent in pre-industrial times, when laws existed as to the amount of wood one could cut at any one time to ensure there would be a supply of timber for the future, but is still a viable form of  agriculture.

==Man-made substances==

===Fired bricks and clay blocks===
[[File:Stapel bakstenen - Pile of bricks 2005 Fruggo.jpg|right|thumb|A pile of fired bricks.]]
[[File:Assentamento com argamassa polimérica.JPG|thumb|Clay blocks (sometimes called clay block brick) being laid with an adhesive rather than mortar]]
[[Brick]]s are made in a similar way to mud-bricks except without the fibrous binder such as straw and are ''fired'' ("burned" in a [[brick clamp]] or [[kiln]]) after they have air-dried to permanently harden them. Kiln fired clay bricks are a [[ceramic]] material. Fired bricks can be solid or have hollow cavities to aid in drying and make them lighter and easier to transport. The individual bricks are placed upon each other in courses using [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. Successive courses being used to build up walls, [[arch]]es, and other architectural elements. Fired brick walls are usually substantially thinner than cob/adobe while keeping the same vertical strength. They require more energy to create but are easier to transport and store, and are lighter than stone blocks. Romans extensively used fired brick of a shape and type now called [[Roman brick]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wienerberger.com/natural-building-with-clay/history-of-bricks] History of bricks wienerberger.com&lt;/ref&gt; Building with brick gained much popularity in the mid-18th century and 19th centuries. This was due to lower costs with increases in brick  &lt;ref name="Prime design build"&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 5 Reasons Why Bricks Are The Most Popular Building Material |url=http://www.primedb.co/top-5-reasons-bricks-popular-building-material-denver-today/ |publisher=primedb.co |date= May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; manufacturing and fire-safety in the ever crowding cities.

The [[cinder block]] supplemented or replaced fired bricks in the late 20th century often being used for the inner parts of masonry walls and by themselves.

[[Structural clay tile]]s (clay blocks) are clay or [[terracotta]] and typically are perforated with holes.

===Cement composites===
[[Cement]] bonded composites are made of hydrated cement paste that binds wood, particles, or fibers to make pre-cast building components. Various fiberous materials, including [[paper]], [[fiberglass]], and [[carbon-fiber]] have been used as binders.

Wood and natural fibers are composed of various soluble organic compounds like [[carbohydrate]]s, [[glycoside]]s and phenolics. These compounds are known to retard cement setting. Therefore, before using a wood in making cement bonded composites, its compatibility with cement is assessed.

Wood-cement compatibility is the ratio of a parameter related to the property of a wood-cement composite to that of a neat cement paste. The compatibility is often expressed as a percentage value. To determine wood-cement compatibility, methods based on different properties are used, such as, hydration characteristics, strength, interfacial bond and morphology. Various methods are used by researchers such as the measurement of hydration characteristics of a cement-aggregate mix;&lt;ref&gt;Sandermann, W. and Kohler, R. (1964) Studies on mineral-bonded wood materials. IV. A short test of the aptitudes of woods for cement-bonded materials. Holzforschung 18, 53:59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weatherwax, R.C. and Tarkow, H. (1964) Effect of wood on setting of Portland cement. For. Prod. J. 14(12), 567–570.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hachmi, M., Moslemi, A.A. and Campbell, A.G. (1990) A new technique to classify the compatibility of wood with cement. Wood Sci. Technol.  24(4), 345–354.&lt;/ref&gt; the comparison of the mechanical properties of cement-aggregate mixes&lt;ref&gt;Hong, Z. and Lee, A.W.C. (1986) Compressive strength of cylindrical samples as an indicator of wood- cement compatibility. For. Prod. J.  36(11/12), 87–90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Demirbas, A. and Aslan, A. (1998) Effects of ground hazelnut shell, wood and tea waste on the mechanical properties of cement. Cement Concrete Res. 28(8), 1101–1104.&lt;/ref&gt; and the visual assessment of microstructural properties of the wood-cement mixes.&lt;ref&gt;Ahn, W.Y. and Moslemi, A.A. (1980) SEM examination of wood-Portland cement bonds. Wood Sci .13(2), 77–82.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that the hydration test by measuring the change in hydration temperature with time is the most convenient method. Recently, Karade et al.&lt;ref&gt;Karade SR, Irle M, Maher K (2003) Assessment of wood-cement compatibility: A new approach.  Holzforschung, 57: 672–680.&lt;/ref&gt; have reviewed these methods of compatibility assessment and suggested a method based on the ‘maturity concept’ i.e. taking in consideration both time and temperature of cement hydration reaction.

Bricks were laid in [[lime mortar]] from the time of the Romans until supplanted by Portland cement [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] in the early 20th century. [[Concrete masonry unit|Cement blocks]] also sometimes are filled with [[grout]] or covered with a [[parge coat]].

===Concrete===
[[File:FalkirkWheelSide 2004 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|right|[[Falkirk Wheel]]]]
[[Concrete]] is a [[composite material|composite]] building material made from the combination of [[aggregate (composite)|aggregate]] and a binder such as [[cement]].  The most common form of concrete is Portland cement concrete, which consists of mineral aggregate (generally [[gravel]] and [[sand]]), [[portland cement]] and [[water (molecule)|water]].

After mixing, the cement [[Hydration reaction|hydrates]] and eventually hardens into a stone-like material. When used in the generic sense, this is the material referred to by the term "concrete".

For a concrete construction of any size, as concrete has a rather low [[tensile strength]], it is generally strengthened using steel rods or bars (known as [[rebar]]s). This strengthened concrete is then referred to as [[reinforced concrete]]. In order to minimise any air bubbles, that would weaken the structure, a vibrator is used to eliminate any air that has been entrained when the liquid concrete mix is poured around the ironwork. Concrete has been the predominant building material in the modern age due to its longevity, formability, and ease of transport. Recent advancements, such as [[insulating concrete form]]s, combine the concrete forming and other construction steps (installation of insulation). All materials must be taken in required proportions as described in standards.

===Fabric===
The tent is the home of choice among nomadic groups all over the world. Two well-known types include the conical [[teepee]] and the circular [[yurt]]. The tent has been revived as a major construction technique with the development of [[tensile architecture]] and synthetic fabrics. Modern buildings can be made of flexible material such as [[Textile|fabric]] membranes, and supported by a system of steel cables, rigid or internal, or by air pressure.

===Foam===
[[File:Celotex thermax foamed plastic sheets.jpg|thumb|right|Foamed plastic sheet to be used as backing for [[Mortar (firestop)|firestop mortar]] at CIBC bank in [[Toronto]].]]
Recently, synthetic [[polystyrene]] or [[polyurethane]] foam has been used in combination with structural materials, such as concrete. It is lightweight, easily shaped, and an excellent insulator. Foam is usually used as part of a [[structural insulated panel]], wherein the foam is sandwiched between wood or cement or insulating concrete forms.

===Glass===
[[Glassmaking]] is considered an art form as well as an industrial process or material.

Clear windows have been used since the invention of glass to cover small openings in a building. Glass panes provided humans with the ability to both let light into rooms while at the same time keeping inclement weather outside.

Glass is generally made from mixtures of sand and [[silicate]]s, in a very hot fire stove called a [[kiln]], and is very brittle. Additives are often included the mixture used to produce glass with shades of colors or various characteristics (such as [[bulletproof glass]] or lightbulbs.

The use of glass in architectural buildings has become very popular in the modern culture. Glass "[[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain walls]]" can be used to cover the entire facade of a building, or it can be used to span over a wide roof structure in a "[[space frame]]". These uses though require some sort of frame to hold sections of glass together, as glass by itself is too brittle and would require an overly large kiln to be used to span such large areas by itself.

[[Glass brick]]s were invented in the early 20th century.

===Gypcrete===
Gypcrete is a mixture of [[gypsum]] plaster and fibreglass [[roving]]s. Although plaster and fibres [[fiborous plaster]] have been used for many years, especially for ceilings, it was not until the early 1990s that serious studies of the strength and qualities of a walling system [[Rapidwall]], using a mixture of gypsum plaster and 300mm plus fibreglass rovings, were investigated. It was discovered, through testing at the [[University of Adelaide]], that these walls had significant, [[load bearing wall|load bearing]], shear and lateral resistance together with earthquake-resistance, fire-resistance, and thermal properties.  With an abundance of gypsum (naturally occurring and by-product chemical FGD and phospho gypsums) available worldwide, gypcrete-based building products, which are fully recyclable, offer significant environmental benefits.

=== Metal ===
[[Metal]] is used as structural framework for larger buildings such as [[skyscraper]]s, or as an external surface covering. There are many types of [[Architectural metals|metals]] used for building. Metal figures quite prominently in [[prefabricated]] structures such as the [[Quonset hut]], and can be seen used in most cosmopolitan cities. It requires a great deal of human labor to produce metal, especially in the large amounts needed for the building industries.
[[Corrosion]] is metal's prime enemy when it comes to longevity.
* [[Steel]] is a metal [[alloy]] whose major component is [[iron]], and is the usual choice for metal structural building materials. It is strong, flexible, and if refined well and/or [[Corrosion prevention|treated]] lasts a long time.
* The lower [[density]] and better [[corrosion]] resistance of [[aluminium]] alloys and [[tin]] sometimes overcome their greater [[cost]].

[[File:20130816 Belfry of St Laurentius Ahrweiler.jpg|thumb|Copper belfry of St. Laurentius church, [[Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler]] ]]
* [[Copper]] is a valued building material because of its advantageous properties (see: [[Copper in architecture]]). These include corrosion resistance, durability, low thermal movement, light weight, radio frequency shielding, lightning protection, sustainability, recyclability, and a wide range of finishes. Copper is incorporated into roofing, flashing, gutters, downspouts, domes, spires, vaults, wall cladding, building expansion joints, and indoor design elements.
* Other metals used include [[Chrome plating|chrome]], [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[titanium]]. Titanium can be used for structural purposes, but it is much more expensive than steel. Chrome, gold, and silver are used as decoration, because these materials are expensive and lack structural qualities such as tensile strength or hardness.

===Plastics===
[[File:Piping floor penetrations nortown casitas.jpg|thumb|left|Plastic [[pipe (material)|pipes]] penetrating a [[concrete]] floor in a Canadian highrise apartment building]]
The term "plastics" covers a range of synthetic or semi-synthetic [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[condensation reaction|condensation]] or [[polymerization]] products that can be molded or extruded into objects, films, or [[synthetic fiber|fibers]]. Their name is derived from the fact that in their semi-liquid state they are malleable, or have the property of [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]]. Plastics vary immensely in heat tolerance, hardness, and resiliency. Combined with this adaptability, the general uniformity of composition and lightness of plastics ensures their use in almost all industrial applications today. [[High performance plastics]] such as ETFE have become an ideal building material due to its high abrasion resistance and chemical inertness. Notable buildings that feature it include: the [[Beijing National Aquatics Center]] and the [[Eden Project]] biomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fluorotherm.com/the-advantages-of-etfe-fluoropolymer-tubing/|title = The Advantages of ETFE Fluoropolymer Tubing|date = April 1, 2015|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Fluorotherm|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Papers and membranes===
Building papers and membranes are used for many reasons in construction. One of the oldest building papers is [[red rosin paper]] which was known to be in use before 1850 and was used as an underlayment in exterior walls, roofs, and floors and for protecting a jobsite during construction. [[Tar paper]] was invented late in the 19th century and was used for similar purposes as rosin paper and for [[built-up roof|gravel roofs]]. Tar paper has largely fallen out of use supplanted by asphalt [[felt paper]]. Felt paper has been supplanted in some uses by synthetic underlayments, particularly in roofing by synthetic underlayments and siding by [[housewrap]]s.

There are a wide variety of [[damp proofing]] and [[waterproofing]] membranes used for roofing, [[basement waterproofing]], and [[geomembrane]]s.

===Ceramics===
Fired clay [[brick]]s have been used since the time of the Romans. Special [[tile]]s are used for roofing, siding, flooring, ceilings,  pipes, flue liners, and more.

==Building products==
In the [[market place]] the term "building products" often refers to ready-made particles/sections, made from various materials, that are fitted in architectural hardware and decorative hardware parts of a building. The list of building products excludes the building materials used to construct the building architecture and supporting fixtures, like windows, doors, cabinets, etc. Building products, rather, support and make building materials work in a [[modular]] fashion.

"Building products" may also refer to items used to put such hardware together, such as [[caulking]], [[glue]]s, paint, and anything else bought for the purpose of constructing a building.

[[File:Mirage III cockpit MG 1348.JPG|thumb|Central forward area of the [[Mirage III]] cockpit, showing a centre stick.]]

A '''centre stick''' (or '''center stick''' in the United States), or simply '''control stick''' is an aircraft [[cockpit]] arrangement where the control column (or [[joystick]]) is located in the center of the cockpit between the [[Aviator|pilot]]'s legs. Since the throttle controls are typically located to the left of the pilot, the right hand is used for the stick, although left-hand or both-hands operation is possible if required.&lt;ref name="Crane"&gt;Crane, Dale: ''Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition'', page 132. Aviation Supplies &amp; Academics, 1997. {{ISBN|1-56027-287-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The centre stick is a part of an aircraft's [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control system]], and is typically linked to its [[aileron]]s and [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevator]]s, or alternatively to its [[elevon]]s, by control rods or control cables on basic aircraft. On heavier, faster, more advanced aircraft the centre stick may also control power-assist modules.  Modern aircraft centre sticks are also usually equipped with a number of electrical control switches within easy finger reach, in order to reduce the pilot's workload.

The centre stick is used in many military fighter jets such as [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] and the [[Mirage III]], but also in [[light aircraft]] such as [[Piper Cub]]s and the [[Diamond Aircraft]] line of products such as the [[DA20]], [[DA40]] and [[DA42]].

This arrangement contrasts with the more recently developed "[[side-stick]]" which is used in such military fighter jets as the [[F-16]], the [[F-35 Lightning II]] and [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] and also on civil aircraft such as the [[Airbus A320]].

== History ==

The centre stick originated at the turn of the twentieth century. In 1900 [[Wilhelm Kress]] of [[Austria]] developed a control stick for aircraft, but did not apply for a patent. Instead, a patent was awarded to the [[France|French]] aviator, [[Robert Esnault-Pelterie]] who applied for it in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[[Connections (TV series)|''Connections'']], Episode 6 Part 5 of 5 (1976).&lt;br&gt;Also: {{cite book | last = Burke | first = James | title = Connections | publisher = Little, Brown | location = Boston | year = 1978 | isbn = 0-316-11681-5 |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chervona Ruta''''' is a 1971 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[musical film]] written by [[Miroslav Skochilyas]] and directed by [[Roman Oleksiv]], starring [[Sofia Rotaru]] and [[Vasyl Zinkevych]] alongside popular Soviet Ukrainian [[musical ensemble|ensemble]]s. One of the first modern Soviet musical films, and the first modern Ukrainian musical filmed in [[Bukovina]] and the [[Carpathian]] mountains in the [[Ukrainian SSR]], Chervona Ruta features short dialogues combined with legendary [[pop-folk]] songs in the [[Ukrainian language]] and characteristic [[Ukraine|Western Ukraine]] dances in modern pop [[choreography]]. The film was released in both a [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and a [[Russian language|Russian]] language version, though in both versions all but one of the songs are in Ukrainian.&lt;ref name="ivasyuk.org.ua"/&gt;

Translated from the {{lang-uk|Червона рута}} — "[[Chervona Ruta]]" literally means "Red [[rue]]". However, the expression became a proper noun in Ukrainian due to popular use. The term derives from the old East [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]] legend, according to which a girl who finds a red colored rue (which are normally yellow) on [[Ivan Kupala Day]], will be happy in [[love]].

== Plot ==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
Oksana (played by Sofia Rotaru) is a young and beautiful Carpathian girl. On the "[[Donetsk]]-[[Verkhovyna]]" train she becomes acquainted with a young miner from [[Donetsk]] called Boris. The travellers fall in love, but are parted when they arrive at their destination. In the [[Carpathian mountains]] their paths diverge, but Boris (played by [[Vasyl Zinkevych]], soloist of the instrumental band "[[Smerichka]]") discovers where she is staying. The couple meet again and rekindle their love. Their friends invite them to perform in a concert for vacationers at a mountain resort,&lt;ref&gt;The Carpathian mountains are a popular Soviet/Ukrainian vacation resort for [[ski|ski-ing]] in winter and [[rafting]] in summer.&lt;/ref&gt; where they sing about their feelings for each other.&lt;ref name="ivasyuk.org.ua"/&gt;

== Cast ==
* [[Sofia Rotaru]] as a young girl Oksana
* [[Vasyl Zinkevych]] as Boris, a young miner from [[Donetsk]]
* [[Volodymyr Ivasyuk]]
* [[Levko Dutkovsky]]
* [[Nazariy Yaremchuk]]
* [[Anatoliy Yevdokymenko]]
* [[Alla Dutkovska]]
* [[Raisa Koltsa]]

== Production ==

The idea to make a movie about Ukrainian pop-folk culture set in the Carpathian mountains arose from the fame of Smerichka and the popularity of the song "Chervona Ruta" in the Soviet Union. The original idea was to make a movie about Smerichka, using Vasily Zinkevich as the main actor (another soloist from the group, Nazariy Yaremchuk, had also been considered). As there was no female leading actor in Smerichka the scenario was changed to a simple plot about a sudden blaze of love between Boris, an unsophisticated miner, and the Bukovinian beauty Oksana. By 1971 Sofia Rotaru was already a well-known singer in Bukovina both for her pop-folk songs and for her victory at the 1968 International Song Festival in [[Bulgaria]]. She was at that time a teacher at the [[Chernivtsi]] Musical College. When filming of the first Ukrainian musical started in [[Yaremcha|Yaremche]] Rotaru was given the role of Oksana.

In the film Sofia Rotaru performs "Grey-winged Bird" — the Italian hit song {{lang-it|[[L'immensità]]}}, professionally [[translation|translated]] in Ukrainian by [[Roman Kudlyk]], "Draw Me the Night" and "Autumn Is Close", and also (in [[duet]] with Zinkevych) "Vodohray".

The recording of "Vodohray" by the [[tenor]] Vasil and the [[alto]] Sofia was not used in the final version of the film. Instead [[Nazariy Yaremchuk]]'s voice was dubbed in place of Vasyl Zinkevych, and Mariya Isak's voice was dubbed in place of Sofia Rotaru in the song. It appears that the original performance had a defective [[soundtrack]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ivasyuk.org.ua/video.php?l=ru&amp;p=chervona_ruta Chervona Ruta] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112065035/http://ivasyuk.org.ua/video.php?l=ru&amp;p=chervona_ruta |date=12 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film Maria Isak appears fifth in the row of five girls, for a couple of seconds.

The fact that the soundtrack for the song "Vodohray" was recorded by other singers was revealed only thirty years later. After the release of the [[television movie]], the singers became famous in the [[USSR]] and in [[Eastern Europe]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3268">'''Children &amp; the Arts''' is an independent [[Charitable organization|charity]] that provides access to [[professional arts]] venues for young people in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] who would otherwise grow up having had no, or very limited opportunity, to engage with the [[arts]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3562980/Charles-the-Prince-of-arts.html Daily Telegraph feature]&lt;/ref&gt; The charity works across the United Kingdom and across a variety of art forms, working in schools and children's [[hospice]]s, allowing local arts venues and children to build sustained and engaged relationships. Children &amp; the Arts is the only children's charity working with hard to reach children to tackle inequality of access across all art forms and across the whole of the UK.

Arts venues and cultural organisations are selected to be part of Children &amp; the Arts' national ''Start'' programme that enables them to partner with schools in local areas of deprivation - schools that have very limited arts provision for students and no connection to their cultural community. Children &amp; the Arts provides the three-year framework, guidance and funding for arts organisations to each work with 300-500 schoolchildren every year. Children are introduced to an artform, inspired to find out more, taught how to enhance their experience of the arts through critique and teamwork and, of course, create and perform themselves.

The charity was formerly known as The Prince's Foundation for Children &amp; the Arts and was one of the Princes Charities, and prior to that The Prince of Wales Arts &amp; Kids Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article2671469.ece The Times] {{Dead link|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==

Children &amp; the Arts began when [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]] visited a pupil referral unit in [[Balsall Heath, Birmingham]].

While going round the school he saw a class studying Shakespeare's "[[Romeo and Juliet]]" under the direction of an inspiring teacher who had roused a great response to the play from the pupils. His Royal Highness was surprised to hear that the children were studying the play without seeing it performed.

Coincidentally, the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] was performing "Romeo and Juliet" at [[Stratford-upon-Avon|Stratford]] at the time. Being president of the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] The [[Prince of Wales]] suggested that the class might like to go and see it. The class went and, after the performance, the cast entertained them on stage.

After the trip all of the students wrote to the Prince saying it was the best experience of their lives. As a result of this experience he decided to take action and began the process which led to the development of his Foundation for Children &amp; the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3562980/Charles-the-Prince-of-arts.html Daily Telegraph feature]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Circle Line Hijack.jpg|thumb|A reveler urges silence in anticipation of the second Circle line party on 14 March 2003]]
A '''Circle line party''' is a type of [[subway party]] occasionally held on the [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle line]] of the [[London Underground]].

==Description==
Although the time and place of these parties is planned, the event itself occurs spontaneously, as each participant decides for themselves what sort of revelry, costume, decorations, snacks, libations and guests to bring to the party. The participants decorate the carriages festively, and play music, either live or on portable sound systems, disguised to appear as normal luggage.

Other activities include setting up [[pole-dancing]] poles on the trains. Free drinks, snacks and sweets are provided, often being provided from well-stocked portable bars and snack tables, which disappear as the train arrives at the station. Commuters are invited to participate in the parties.

To maintain a low profile while the trains are in the stations, most participants only revel and frolic once the trains are in tunnels. Permission is not sought from [[London Underground]] or the [[British Transport Police]] for Circle line parties, and police sometimes stop trains for long periods to break the parties up. However, their organisers, typically linked to [[anarchist]] groups such as the [[Space Hijackers]], claim that Circle line parties are not meant to disrupt travel, but to "reclaim the public space from the advertisers and give it back to the people to whom it belongs".

===May 2008 party===
[[File:Last Round on the Underground (1).jpg|thumb|Thousands celebrate the last night of legal drinking on the Underground in May 2008]]
On 7 May 2008, the newly elected [[Mayor of London]] [[Boris Johnson]] announced that the drinking of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] would be banned on public transport from 1 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Johnson bans drink on transport |author= |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7387113.stm |newspaper=BBC News Online |date=7 May 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people then thought up the idea of a Circle line party to be held at the end of the month to celebrate the last night of legal drinking on the London Underground, and spread the idea on the [[social networking]] website [[Facebook]]. The plan quickly received media attention and was mentioned in several newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cocktail party plan to mark the end of the line for tube drinkers |author= |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/may/16/circle.line.cocktail.party |newspaper=The Guardian |date=16 May 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 May, the night itself, thousands of people attended, the largest Circle line party ever. Some dressed in costumes ranging from 1920s [[prohibition]] figures to Boris Johnson himself. The line was suspended after several trains were damaged during the party, and a number of London Underground staff and police officers were assaulted. Seventeen people were arrested due to disorderly behaviour and six tube stations were closed as they became overcrowded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tube drinks party sparks mayhem |author= |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7429638.stm |newspaper=BBC News Online |date=1 June 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dot and the Kangaroo''''' is a children's book written by [[Ethel Pedley|Ethel C. Pedley]] about a little girl named Dot who gets lost in the Australian [[outback]] and is eventually befriended by a [[kangaroo]] and several other [[marsupial]]s. The book was adapted into a stage production in 1924, and a film in 1977.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Giannalberto Bendazzi, Cartoons: One Hundred Years of Cinema Animation, Indiana university Press, {{ISBN|0-253-20937-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot introduction==
A 5-year-old girl named Dot is lost in the outback after chasing a hare into the wood and losing sight of her home. She is approached by a red kangaroo who gives her some berries to eat. Upon eating the berries, Dot is able to understand the language of all animals, and she tells the kangaroo her plight. The kangaroo, who has lost her own joey, decides to help little Dot despite her own fear of humans. The book is filled with criticism on negative human interference in the wild in 1884.

{{Refimprove|date=February 2018}}

In [[computer programming]], an '''entry point''' is where control is transferred from a [[Loader (computing)|loader]] or [[operating system]] to a [[computer program]], at which place the processor enters a program or a [[Machine code|code]] fragment and [[Execution (computing)|execution]] begins. (It's possible that the computer program itself is the operating system, in which case the launcher is the [[bootloader]]). In some operating systems or [[programming language]]s, the initial entry is not part of the program but of the [[runtime library]], in which case the runtime library initializes the program and then the runtime library enters the program. In other cases, the program may call the runtime library before doing anything when it is entered for the first time, and, after the runtime library returns, the actual code of the program begins to execute. This marks the transition from [[load time]] (and dynamic [[link time]], if present) to [[run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]].

In simple [[Layout (computing)|layouts]], programs begin their execution at the beginning, which is common in [[scripting language]]s, simple binary [[executable]] formats, and [[boot loader]]s. In other cases, the entry point is at some other fixed point, which is some [[memory address]] than can be an [[absolute address]] or relative address ([[offset (computer science)|offset]]).

Alternatively, execution of a program can begin at a named point, either with a conventional name defined by the [[programming language]] or [[operating system]], or at a caller-specified name. In many programming languages, notably [[C (programming language)|C]], this named point is a function called &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;; as a result, the entry point is often called the '''main function'''.

A common form of the '''main function''' in C, C# or C++, is a static method, either returning no data (&lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt;) or a number (&lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;), also known as the [[return code]].
[[File:Program-entry-point-demonstration-CSharp.png|alt=Example of the main function, in C#.|none|thumb|467x467px|How the &lt;code&gt;Main()&lt;/code&gt; might look in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] source code. Different parts are labeled for users who know less about programming.]]

== Usage ==
Entry points apply both to source code and to [[executable]] files. However, in day-to-day [[software development]], programmers specify the entry points only in source code, which makes them much better known. Entry points in executable files depend on the [[application binary interface]] (ABI) of the actual operating system, and are generated by the compiler or linker (if not fixed by the ABI). Non-executable [[object file]]s may also have entry points, which are used later by the linker when generating entry points of an executable file.

Entry points are capable of passing on command arguments, variables, or other information as a local variable used by the &lt;code&gt;Main()&lt;/code&gt; method. This way, specific options may be set upon execution of the program, and then interpreted by the program. Many programs use this as an alternative way to configure different settings, or perform a set variety of actions using a single program.

=== Contemporary ===
In most of today's popular programming languages and operating systems, a [[computer program]] usually only has a single ''entry point''.

In [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[D programming language|D]], [[Rust programming language|Rust]] and [[Kotlin (programming language)|Kotlin]] programs this is a [[Function (computer science)|function]] named &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;; in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] it is a [[static method]] named &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; (although the class must be specified at the invocation time), and in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] it is a static method named &lt;code&gt;Main&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLTBW_2.3.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r3.cbclx01/mainf.htm |title=The main() function |publisher=[[IBM]] |work=ibm.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/acy3edy3.aspx |title=Main() and Command-Line Arguments (C# Programming Guide) |publisher=Msdn.microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In major operating systems, the standard executable format has a single entry point. In the [[Executable and Linkable Format]] (ELF), used in [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems such as [[Linux]], the entry point is specified in the &lt;code&gt;e_entry&lt;/code&gt; field of the ELF header. In the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (gcc), the entry point used by the linker is the &lt;code&gt;_start&lt;/code&gt; symbol. Similarly, in the [[Portable Executable]] format, used in [[Microsoft Windows]], the entry point is specified by the &lt;code&gt;AddressOfEntryPoint&lt;/code&gt; field, which is inherited from [[COFF]]. In [[COM file]]s, the entry point is at the fixed [[offset (computer science)|offset]] of 0100h.

One notable modern exception to the single-entry-point paradigm is [[Android (operating system)|Android]].  Unlike applications on most other operating systems, Android applications do not have a single entry point{{snd}} there is no &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function, for example.  Instead of a single entry point, they have essential components (which include activities and services) which the system can instantiate and run as needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/android/devguide/guide/topics/fundamentals.html |title=Application Fundamentals |work=Android Development |accessdate=2014-02-19 |publisher=linuxtopia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An occasionally used technique is the [[fat binary]], which consists of several executables for different targets packaged in a single binary. Most commonly, this is implemented by a single overall entry point, which is compatible with all targets and branches to the target-specific entry point. Alternative techniques include storing separate executables in separate [[fork (file system)|forks]], each with its own entry point, which is then selected by the operating system.

=== Historical ===
Historically, and in some contemporary [[legacy system]]s, such as [[OpenVMS|VMS]] and [[OS/400]], computer programs have a multitude of ''entry points'', each corresponding to the different functionalities of the program. The usual way to denote entry points, as used system-wide in VMS and in [[PL/I]] and [[Macro (computer science)|MACRO]] programs, is to append them at the end of the name of the [[executable image]], delimited by a [[dollar sign]] ($), e.g. &lt;code&gt;directory.exe$make&lt;/code&gt;.

The [[Apple I]] computer also used this to some degree. For example, an alternative entry point in Apple I's [[BASIC]] would keep the BASIC program useful when the reset button was accidentally pushed.{{Clarify|date=July 2010}}&lt;!-- in memory? difficult to know without a reference --&gt;

== Exit point ==
In general, programs can exit at any time in an unstructured way, by returning to the operating system or [[crash (computing)|crashing]]. Scripting languages typically end by reaching the end of the program, but for binaries the control must return to the operating system or it will simply run off the end of the process's memory, either executing whatever code is there or (in modern operating systems) resulting in a [[memory access]] violation and termination by the operating system.

Usually, there is not a single exit point specified in a program. However, in other cases runtimes ensure that programs always terminate in a structured way via a single exit point, which is guaranteed unless the runtime itself crashes; this allows cleanup code to be run, such as &lt;code&gt;atexit&lt;/code&gt; handlers. This can be done by either requiring that programs terminate by returning from the main function, by calling a specific exit function, or by the runtime catching exceptions or operating system signals.

==Programming languages==
In many programming languages, the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function is where a program starts its execution. It enables high-level organization of the program's functionality, and typically has access to the [[command-line argument|command arguments]] given to the program when it was executed.

The main function is generally the first programmer-written [[subroutine|function]] that runs when a program starts, and is invoked directly from the system-specific initialization contained in the [[runtime environment]] ([[crt0]] or equivalent). However, some languages can execute user-written functions before main runs, such as the constructors of [[C++]] global objects.

In other languages, notably [[scripting language]]s, execution simply begins at the start of the program.

A non-exhaustive list of programming languages follows, describing their way of defining the main entry point:

===APL===
In [[APL (programming language)|APL]], when a workspace is loaded, the contents of "quad LX" (latent expression) variable is interpreted as an APL expression and executed.

===C and C++===
In [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]], the [[function prototype]] of the main function looks like one of the following:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int main(void);
int main();

int main(int argc, char **argv);
int main(int argc, char *argv[]);
int main(int argc, char **argv, char **env);



// more specifically in C
// NOT according to the ISO C standard 5.1.2.2.1
// BUT in embedded programming depending on the µC, this form is also used
void main (void);


&lt;/source&gt;

The [[parameter (computer science)|parameters]] &lt;code&gt;argc&lt;/code&gt;, ''argument count'', and &lt;code&gt;argv&lt;/code&gt;, ''argument vector'',&lt;ref&gt;argv: the vector term in this variable's name is used in traditional sense to refer to strings.&lt;/ref&gt; respectively give the number and values of the program's [[command-line argument]]s. The names of &lt;code&gt;argc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;argv&lt;/code&gt; may be any valid identifier in C, but it is common convention to use these names. In C++, the names are to be taken literally, and the "void" in the parameter list is to be omitted, if strict conformance is desired.&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/group/comp.std.c++/browse_thread/thread/a1e5504b499bc58f Parameter types and names of main]&lt;/ref&gt; Other platform-dependent formats are also allowed by the C and C++ standards, except that in C++ the return type must always be &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;Section 3.6.1.2, Standard C++ 2011 edition.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, [[Unix]] (though not [[POSIX.1]]) and [[Windows]] have a third argument giving the program's [[environment variable|environment]], otherwise accessible through &lt;code&gt;getenv&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;[[stdlib.h]]&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp);
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]-based operating systems, such as [[macOS]], have a fourth parameter containing arbitrary OS-supplied information, such as the path to the executing binary:&lt;ref&gt;[http://unixjunkie.blogspot.com/2006/02/char-apple-argument-vector.html The &lt;code&gt;char *apple&lt;/code&gt; Argument Vector]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp, char **apple);
&lt;/source&gt;

The value returned from the main function becomes the [[exit status]] of the process, though the C standard only ascribes specific meaning to two values: &lt;code&gt;EXIT_SUCCESS&lt;/code&gt; (traditionally 0) and &lt;code&gt;EXIT_FAILURE&lt;/code&gt;. The meaning of other possible return values is implementation-defined. In case a return value is not defined by the programmer, an implicit &lt;code&gt;return 0;&lt;/code&gt; at the end of the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; function is inserted by the compiler; this behavior is required by the C++ standard.

It is guaranteed that &lt;code&gt;argc&lt;/code&gt; is non-negative and that &lt;code&gt;argv[argc]&lt;/code&gt; is a [[null pointer]]. By convention, the command-line arguments specified by &lt;code&gt;argc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;argv&lt;/code&gt; include the name of the program as the first element if &lt;code&gt;argc&lt;/code&gt; is greater than 0; if a user types a command of "&lt;code&gt;rm file&lt;/code&gt;", the [[shell (computing)|shell]] will initialise the &lt;code&gt;[[rm (Unix)|rm]]&lt;/code&gt; process with &lt;code&gt;argc = 2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;argv = {"rm", "file", NULL}&lt;/code&gt;.  As &lt;code&gt;argv[0]&lt;/code&gt; is the name that processes appear under in &lt;code&gt;[[ps (Unix)|ps]]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[[top (Unix)|top]]&lt;/code&gt; etc., some programs, such as [[Daemon (computer software)|daemons]] or those running within an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] or [[virtual machine]] (where &lt;code&gt;argv[0]&lt;/code&gt; would be the name of the host executable), may choose to alter their argv to give a more descriptive &lt;code&gt;argv[0]&lt;/code&gt;, usually by means of the &lt;code&gt;[[Exec (operating system)|exec]]&lt;/code&gt; system call.

The &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; function is special; normally every C and C++ program must define it exactly once.

If declared, &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; must be declared as if it has external linkage; it cannot be declared &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt;.

In C++, &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; must be in the global [[namespace]] (i.e. &lt;code&gt;::main&lt;/code&gt;), cannot be overloaded, and cannot be a [[member function]], although the name is not otherwise reserved, and may be used for member functions, classes, enumerations, or non-member functions in other namespaces. In C++ (unlike C) &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; cannot be called [[Recursion (computer science)|recursively]] and cannot have its address taken.

===C#===
When executing a program written in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], the [[Common Language Runtime|CLR]] searches for a static method marked with the &lt;code&gt;.entrypoint&lt;/code&gt; IL directive, which takes either no arguments, or a single argument of type &lt;code&gt;string[]&lt;/code&gt;, and has a return type of &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, and executes it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/04/02/NETConsoleApps/ |title=Console Applications in .NET, or Teaching a New Dog Old Tricks |publisher=Msdn.microsoft.com |date=2003-06-12 |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="csharp"&gt;
static void Main();
static void Main(string[] args);
static int Main();
static int Main(string[] args);
&lt;/source&gt;

Command-line arguments are passed in &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt;, similar to how it is done in Java. For versions of &lt;code&gt;Main()&lt;/code&gt; returning an integer, similar to both C and C++, it is passed back to the environment as the exit status of the process.

Since C#7.1 there are four more possible signatures of the entry point, which allow asynchronous execution in the &lt;code&gt;Main()&lt;/code&gt; Method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/proposals/csharp-7.1/async-main.md}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="csharp"&gt;
static Task Main()
static Task&lt;int&gt; Main()
static Task Main(string[])
static Task&lt;int&gt; Main(string[])
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;Task&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Task&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; types are the asynchronous equivalents of &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;.

===Clean===
[[Clean (programming language)|Clean]] is a functional programming language based on graph rewriting. The initial node is called &lt;code&gt;Start&lt;/code&gt; and is of type &lt;code&gt;*World -&gt; *World&lt;/code&gt; if it ''changes'' the world or some fixed type if the program only prints the result after [[graph rewriting|reducing]] &lt;code&gt;Start&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
Start :: *World -&gt; *World
Start world = startIO ...
&lt;/source&gt;

Or even simpler

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
Start :: String
Start = "Hello, world!"
&lt;/source&gt;

One tells the compiler which option to use to generate the executable file.

===Common Lisp===
ANSI Common Lisp does not define a main function; instead, the code is read and evaluated from top to bottom in a source file. However, the following code will [[Emulator|emulate]] a main function.

&lt;source lang="lisp"&gt;
(defun hello-main ()
  (format t "Hello World!~%"))

(hello-main)
&lt;/source&gt;

===D===
In [[D (programming language)|D]], the [[function prototype]] of the main function looks like one of the following:

&lt;source lang="D"&gt;
void main();
void main(string[] args);
int main();
int main(string[] args);
&lt;/source&gt;

Command-line arguments are passed in &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt;, similar to how it is done in C# or Java. For versions of &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; returning an integer, similar to both C and C++, it is passed back to the environment as the exit status of the process.

===FORTRAN===
[[FORTRAN]] does not have a main subroutine or function. Instead a &lt;code&gt;PROGRAM&lt;/code&gt; statement as the first line can be used to specify that a program unit is a main program, as shown below. The &lt;code&gt;PROGRAM&lt;/code&gt; statement cannot be used for recursive calls.&lt;ref&gt;XL FORTRAN for [[AIX]]. Language Reference. Third Edition, 1994. [[IBM]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="fortran"&gt;
      PROGRAM HELLO
      PRINT *, "Cint!"
      END PROGRAM HELLO
&lt;/source&gt;

Some versions of Fortran, such as those on the [[IBM System/360]] and successor mainframes, do not support the PROGRAM statement. Many compilers from other software manufacturers will allow a fortran program to be compiled without a PROGRAM statement. In these cases, whatever module that has any non-comment statement where no SUBROUTINE, FUNCTION or BLOCK DATA statement occurs, is considered to be the Main program.

===GNAT===
Using [[GNAT]], the programmer is not required to write a function called &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;; a source file containing a single subprogram can be compiled to an executable. The binder will however create a package &lt;code&gt;ada_main&lt;/code&gt;, which will contain and export a C-style main function.

===Go===
In [[Go (programming language)|Go]] programming language, program execution starts with the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function of the &lt;code&gt;package main&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;source lang="go"&gt;
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
 fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
&lt;/source&gt;

There is no way to access arguments or a return code outside of the standard library in Go. These can be accessed via &lt;code&gt;os.Args&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;os.Exit&lt;/code&gt; respectively, both of which are included in the &lt;code&gt;"os"&lt;/code&gt; package.

===Haskell===
A [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] program must contain a name called &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; bound to a value of type &lt;code&gt;IO t&lt;/code&gt;, for some type &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/modules.html |title=The Haskell 98 Report: Modules |publisher=Haskell.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is usually &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; is a [[monads in functional programming|monad]], which organizes [[Side effect (computer science)|side-effects]] in terms of [[purely functional programming|purely functional]] code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geekrant.wordpress.com/2008/06/23/misconceptions/ Some Haskell Misconceptions: Idiomatic Code, Purity, Laziness, and IO] — on Haskell's monadic IO&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; value represents the side-effects-ful computation done by the program. The result of the computation represented by &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; is discarded; that is why &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; usually has type &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;, which indicates that the type of the result of the computation is &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;, the [[unit type]], which contains no information.

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello, World!"
&lt;/source&gt;

Command line arguments are not given to &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;; they must be fetched using another IO action, such as &lt;code&gt;[https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/libraries/base-4.11.1.0/System-Environment.html#v%3AgetArgs System.Environment.getArgs]&lt;/code&gt;.

===Java===
[[Java (programming language)|Java]] programs start executing at the main [[method (computer science)|method]], which has the following [[method heading]]:

&lt;source lang="java5"&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
public static void main(String... args)
public static void main(String args[])
&lt;/source&gt;

Command-line arguments are passed in &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt;. As in C and C++, the name "&lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt;" is special. Java's main methods do not return a value directly, but one can be passed by using the &lt;code&gt;System.exit()&lt;/code&gt; method.

Unlike C, the name of the program is not included in &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt;, because the name of the program is exactly the name of the class that contains the main method called, so it is already known. Also unlike C, the number of arguments need not be included, since arrays in Java have a field that keeps track of how many elements there are.

Another aspect unique to Java is that the main function must be included within a class, and then called manually by the runtime. This is because in Java everything has to be contained within a class. For instance, a [[hello world]] program in Java may look like so:

&lt;source lang="java5"&gt;
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

To run this program, one must call &lt;code&gt;java HelloWorld&lt;/code&gt; in the directory where the compiled [[Java class file|class file]] (which itself must be named &lt;code&gt;HelloWorld.class&lt;/code&gt;) exists. Alternatively, executable [[JAR (file format)|JAR]] files use a [[manifest file]] to specify the entry point in a manner that is filesystem-independent from the user's perspective.

In [[Logo (programming language)|FMSLogo]], the procedures when loaded do not execute. To make them execute, it is necessary to use this code:

 to procname
  ...                 ; Startup commands (such as print [Welcome])
 end

 make "startup [procname]

Note that the variable &lt;code&gt;startup&lt;/code&gt; is used for the startup list of actions, but the convention is that this calls another procedure that runs the actions. That procedure may be of any name.

===OCaml===
[[OCaml]] has no &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function. Programs are evaluated from top to bottom.

Command-line arguments are available in an array named &lt;code&gt;Sys.argv&lt;/code&gt; and the exit status is 0 by default.

Example:
&lt;source lang="ocaml"&gt;

print_endline "Hello World"

&lt;/source&gt;

===Pascal===
In [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], the main procedure is the only unnamed procedure in the program. Because Pascal programs have the procedures and functions in a more rigorous top-down order than C, C++ or Java programs, the main procedure is usually the last procedure in the program. Pascal does not have a special meaning for the name "&lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;" or any similar name.

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
program Hello(Output);
begin
  writeln('Hello, world!');
end.
&lt;/source&gt;

Command-line arguments are counted in &lt;code&gt;ParamCount&lt;/code&gt; and accessible as strings by &lt;code&gt;ParamStr(n)&lt;/code&gt;, with n between 0 and &lt;code&gt;ParamCount&lt;/code&gt;.

Note that "unit" or "module" based versions of Pascal start the main module with the PROGRAM keyword, while other separately compiled modules start with UNIT (UCSD/Borland) or MODULE (ISO). The unnamed function in modules is often module initialization, and run before the main program starts.

===Perl===
In [[Perl]], there is no main function. Statements are executed from top to bottom.

Command-line arguments are available in the special array &lt;code&gt;@ARGV&lt;/code&gt;. Unlike C, &lt;code&gt;@ARGV&lt;/code&gt; does not contain the name of the program, which is &lt;code&gt;$0&lt;/code&gt;.

===PHP===
PHP does not have a "main" function. Starting from the first line of a PHP script, any code not encapsulated by a function header is executed as soon as it is seen.

===Pike===
In [[Pike (programming language)|Pike]] syntax is similar to that of C and C++.  The execution begins at &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;.  The "&lt;code&gt;argc&lt;/code&gt;" variable keeps the number of [[Parameter (computer science)|arguments]] passed to the program.  The "&lt;code&gt;argv&lt;/code&gt;" variable holds the value associated with the arguments passed to the program.

Example:
&lt;source lang="pike"&gt;
 int main(int argc, array(string) argv)
&lt;/source&gt;

===Python===
[[Python (programming language)|Python]] programs are evaluated top-to-bottom, as is usual in scripting languages: the entry point is the start of the source code. Since definitions must precede use, programs are typically structured with definitions at the top and the code to execute at the bottom (unindented), similar to code for a [[one-pass compiler]], such as in Pascal.

Alternatively, a program can be structured with an explicit &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function containing the code to be executed when a program is executed directly, but which can also be invoked by importing the program as a module and calling the function. This can be done by the following idiom, which relies on the internal variable &lt;code&gt;__name__&lt;/code&gt; being set to &lt;code&gt;__main__&lt;/code&gt; when a program is executed, but not when it is imported as a module (in which case it is instead set to the module name); there are many variants of this structure:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Python main() functions
|author=Ned Batchelder

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
import sys

def main(argv):
    n = int(argv[1])
    print(n + 1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.exit(main(sys.argv))
&lt;/source&gt;

In this idiom, the call to the named entry point &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; is explicit, and the interaction with the operating system (receiving the arguments, calling system exit) are done explicitly by library calls, which are ultimately handled by the Python runtime. This contrast with C, where these are done ''implicitly'' by the runtime, based on convention.

=== QB64 ===
The [[QB64]] language has no main function, the code that is not within a function, or subroutine is executed first, from top to bottom:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="vb"&gt;
print "Hello World! a =";
a = getInteger(1.8d): print a

function getInteger(n as double)
    getInteger = int(n)
end function
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Command line arguments (if any) can be read using the COMMAND$ function:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="vb"&gt;
dim shared commandline as string
commandline = COMMAND$

'Several space-separared command line arguments can be read using COMMAND$(n)
commandline1 = COMMAND$(2)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Ruby===
In [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], there is no distinct main function. The code written without additional "&lt;code&gt;class .. end&lt;/code&gt;", "&lt;code&gt;module .. end&lt;/code&gt;" enclosures is executed directly, step by step, in context of special "&lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;" object. This object can be referenced using:

&lt;source lang="irb"&gt;
irb(main):001:0&gt; self
=&gt; main
&lt;/source&gt;

and contain the following properties:

&lt;source lang="irb"&gt;
irb(main):002:0&gt; self.class
=&gt; Object
irb(main):003:0&gt; self.class.ancestors
=&gt; [Object, Kernel, BasicObject]
&lt;/source&gt;

Methods defined without additional classes/modules are defined as private methods of the "&lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;" object, and, consequently, as private methods of almost any other object in Ruby:

&lt;source lang="irb"&gt;
irb(main):004:0&gt; def foo
irb(main):005:1&gt;   42
irb(main):006:1&gt; end
=&gt; nil
irb(main):007:0&gt; foo
=&gt; 42
irb(main):008:0&gt; [].foo
NoMethodError: private method `foo' called for []:Array
	from (irb):8
	from /usr/bin/irb:12:in `&lt;main&gt;'
irb(main):009:0&gt; false.foo
NoMethodError: private method `foo' called for false:FalseClass
	from (irb):9
	from /usr/bin/irb:12:in `&lt;main&gt;'
&lt;/source&gt;

Number and values of command-line arguments can be determined using the single &lt;code&gt;ARGV&lt;/code&gt; constant array:

&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
$ irb /dev/tty foo bar

tty(main):001:0&gt; ARGV
ARGV
=&gt; ["foo", "bar"]
tty(main):002:0&gt; ARGV.size
ARGV.size
=&gt; 2
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that first element of &lt;code&gt;ARGV&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ARGV[0]&lt;/code&gt;, contains the first command-line argument, not the name of program executed, as in C. The name of program is available using &lt;code&gt;$0&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;$PROGRAM_NAME&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/rubyworld.html#UB Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide, Ruby and Its World] — on Ruby &lt;code&gt;ARGV&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to Python, one could use:

&lt;source lang="ruby"&gt;
if __FILE__ == $PROGRAM_NAME
  # Put "main" code here
end
&lt;/source&gt;

===Rust===
&lt;source lang="rust"&gt;
fn main() {
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Visual Basic===
In [[Visual Basic]], when a project contains no forms, the startup object may be the &lt;code&gt;Main()&lt;/code&gt; procedure. The &lt;code&gt;Command$&lt;/code&gt; function can be optionally used to access the argument portion of the command line used to launch the program:
&lt;source lang="vb"&gt;
Sub Main()
    Debug.Print "Hello World!"
    MsgBox "Arguments if any are: " &amp; Command$
End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

===Xojo===
In [[Xojo]], there are two different project types, each with a different main entry point. Desktop (GUI) applications start with the &lt;code&gt;App.Open&lt;/code&gt; event of the project's &lt;code&gt;Application&lt;/code&gt; object. Console applications start with the &lt;code&gt;App.Run&lt;/code&gt; event of the project's &lt;code&gt;ConsoleApplication&lt;/code&gt; object. In both instances, the main function is automatically generated, and cannot be removed from the project.

Local TV station [[CHCH]] introduced Canadians to ''[[Smith &amp; Smith]]'', which featured [[Steve Smith (comedian)|Steve]] and [[Morag Smith]] (the former better known from his stint as [[The Red Green Show|Red Green]]). ''[[The Hilarious House of Frightenstein]]'' was a Canadian children's television series which was also produced by [[CHCH]] in 1971. It was syndicated to television stations across Canada and the [[United States]], and occasionally still appears today in some TV markets. The show's cast included [[Billy Van]], [[Fishka Rais]], [[Guy Big]], Mitch Markowitz, [[Vincent Price]], and [[Julius Sumner Miller]]. One hundred and thirty episodes of the series were made in a nine-month span starting in 1971. ''[[Don Cherry (ice hockey)|Don Cherry]]'s Grapevine'' began airing on CHCH TV in the 1980s and shot on location at CHCH TV's Telecentre on King Street West and then at CHCH's main studio on Jackson Street West. The production then moved (including the original set and bar) to the restaurant Cherry had in town, also called "Don Cherry's Grapevine". The restaurant was on Main Street East. CHCH also produced local broadcasts such as ''[[Tiny Talent Time]]'' and ''[[Party Game (game show)|Party Game]]''.&lt;ref name=MEMPRO&gt;{{cite press release| title =The Hamilton Memory Project;| publisher =The Hamilton Spectator- Souvenir Edition| date = June 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This citation applies to the last 3 sentences of this paragraph --&gt;

''[[Power Play (1998 TV series)|Power Play]]'' was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] television drama series that aired on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] from 1998 to 2000. The show starred [[Michael Riley]] as Brett Parker, a former [[New York City]] sports agent who became the general manager of a (fictional) [[National Hockey League]] franchise, the [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] Steelheads.&lt;ref name=POWERPLAY&gt;{{cite web| title = Internet Movie Database: Power Play (TV series)| url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0161185/| accessdate = 2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Hamiltonians played a part in the early development of Hollywood, including [[Jean Adair]] (1873–1953),&lt;ref name=ADAIR&gt;{{cite web| title = Internet Movie Database Biography: Jean Adair| url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0010443/| accessdate = 2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julia Arthur]] (1868–1959),&lt;ref name=ARTHUR&gt;{{cite web| title = Internet Broadway Database Biography: Julia Arthur| url=http://www.ibdb.com/person.asp?ID=14065| accessdate = 2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Douglass Dumbrille]] (1889–1974),&lt;ref name=DUMBRILLE&gt;{{cite web| title = Internet Movie Database Biography: Douglas Dumbrille| url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0241523/| accessdate = 2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Florence Lawrence]] (1890–1938) who was a [[silent film]] actress and often referred to as "Hollywood's First Movie Star". She was also known as "The Biograph Girl" and "The Girl of a Thousand Faces". During her lifetime, Lawrence appeared in more than 270 [[films]] for various motion picture companies.&lt;ref name=HAMBIO3&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Hamilton Biography (Vol III, 1925-1939)|first=Thomas Melville |last=Bailey|publisher=W.L. Griffin Ltd|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Del Lord]] ([[Grimsby, Ontario]]) was an early Hollywood film director and actor, best known as a director of [[Three Stooges]] films. Interested in the [[theatre]], he travelled to [[New York City]]; when fellow Canadian [[Mack Sennett]] offered him a job at his new [[Keystone Studios]], Lord went on to work in Hollywood, [[California]]. There he played the driver of the [[Keystone Kops]] police van, appearing in several of the successful films.&lt;ref name=LORD&gt;{{cite web| title = Internet Movie Database Biography: Del Lord| url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0520419/| accessdate = 2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern-day contributions to Hollywood by Hamiltonians include [[Second City Television|SCTV]] alumni [[Eugene Levy]], [[Martin Short]], and [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]]. All three attended [[McMaster University]] along with [[John Candy]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Mac&gt;{{cite web| title = McMaster University Alumni| url=http://www.mcmaster.ca/ua/alumni/| accessdate = 2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Well-known movie directors and producers in Hollywood from Hamilton are [[Daniel Goldberg (Producer)|Daniel Goldberg]] (''[[Space Jam]]'', ''[[Twins (1988 film)|Twins]]'') and Slovakian-born, Canadian-raised [[Ivan Reitman]]. Reitman is most remembered for directing and producing a string of comedies, mostly in the 1980s and 1990s (''[[Meatballs (movie)|Meatballs]]'', ''[[Stripes (movie)|Stripes]]'' and ''[[Ghostbusters]]''). Reitman is also a founder of the McMaster Film Board at McMaster University.&lt;ref name=REITMAN&gt;{{cite web| title = Internet Movie Database Biography: Ivan Reitman| url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0718645/| accessdate = 2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reitman and Goldberg have worked together in the past on a number of film productions and continue to work together today as partners in the production company [[Northern Lights Entertainment]].&lt;ref name=GOLDREIT&gt;{{cite web| title = Internet Movie Database Biography: Daniel Goldberg (I)| url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0325175/bio| accessdate = 2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GOLDREIT2&gt;{{cite web| title = Tribute.ca: Ivan Reitman| url=http://www.tribute.ca/bio.asp?id=1971| accessdate = 2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GOLDREIT3&gt;{{cite web| title = CinemaReview.com: "Reitman currently heads Northern Lights Entertainment"| url=http://www.cinemareview.com/cast.asp?movieid=069804&amp;castid=1053| accessdate = 2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others include [[Kathleen Robertson]], best known for her work on [[Beverly Hills, 90210|90210]](1994-1997) and 2002 crime film [[Torso: The Evelyn Dick Story]] and [[Stana Katic]] best known for her role as Detective [[Kate Beckett]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Castle (TV series)|Castle]]''.

==Production locations==
[[List of streets in Hamilton, Ontario|Many of the streets of Hamilton]] are used for a number TV/ film shoots. Some examples of these are listed below:

In 1999, ''[[Detroit Rock City]]'', starring the rock group [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], was filmed at the [[Copps Coliseum]] [[arena]] on [[Bay Street (Hamilton)|Bay Street North]].&lt;ref name=DETROITKISS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cswap.com/1999/Detroit_Rock_City |title=CSWAP: Detroit Rock City filmed in Hamilton, Ontario|accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DETROITKISSB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kissasylum.com/movie/index.shtml |title= (www.kissasylum.com) "KISS Shoots Film Scenes In Ontario ."|accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[Copps Coliseum]] was used again to film [[Meg Ryan]]'s ''[[Against the Ropes]]''.&lt;ref name=AGAINSTROPES&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribute.ca/movies/synopsis.asp?id=4989 |title= (www.tribute.ca) Against the Ropes filmed in Hamilton.|accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[LIUNA Station]] reopened the [[James Street (Hamilton, Ontario)|James Street North]] [[Canadian National]] rail station as a banquet hall. In 1996 the station was used for the most expensive film ever made in Canada to that time, ''[[The Long Kiss Goodnight]]'', which cost [[United States dollar|US$]]$95,000,000 to make and starred [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. Also in 2000, ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', featuring [[Hugh Jackman]] and [[Patrick Stewart]], shot some of its scenes at LIUNA Station.&lt;ref name=hamfilmA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/x/xmen.html |title=The World Wide Guide to Movie Locations: X-Men filming locations- Hamilton, Ontario|accessdate=2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FOOTSTEPS&gt;{{cite book|title=Footsteps In Time: Exploring Hamilton's heritage neighbourhoods|first=Bill |last=Manson |publisher=North Shore Publishing Inc|year=2003|isbn= 1-896899-22-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, parts of [[Sean Connery]]'s ''[[Finding Forrester]]'' was filmed inside the gymnasium of Cathedral Secondary School on [[King Street (Hamilton, Ontario)|King Street East]] and Copps Coliseum arena stands in for Madison Square Garden in the film.&lt;ref name=EXITWOUNDS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movielocity.com/p/finding_forrester.htm |title= (www.movielocity.com) Finding Forrester: "Copps Coliseum stands in for Madison Square Garden in the film." |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the [[Steven Seagal]] film ''[[Exit Wounds]]'' used the streets of Downtown Hamilton for a period of six weeks for a night shoot of the movie's climatic chase scene that features the Gore Park water fountain and the [[Hamilton GO Centre|Hamilton GO Transit station]] (the original site of the [[Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway]] from 1892 to 1987).&lt;ref name=EXITWOUNDSA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://episodenetwork.com/content/view/748/70/ |title= (www.episodenetwork.com) Exit Wounds: Parts of it shot in Hamilton, Ontario |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, around the corner, the second unit was shooting a rapid-fire car crash involving a motorcycle, a car, and a couple of dumpsters. Downtown Hamilton had been invaded by the cast and crews of "Exit Wounds," but no one seemed to mind and even though it was the middle of the night, a huge crowd was on hand to cheer the performers on.&lt;ref name=EXITWOUNDSB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinema.com/articles/358/exit-wounds-production-information.phtml |title= (www.cinema.com) Exit Wounds: Production Information |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HAMHOLLYWOOD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myhamilton.ca/NR/rdonlyres/4DCC9006-FD30-4F14-935C-DE181386FA62/0/investhamilton2005.pdf |format=PDF|title= (www.myhamilton.ca) Hamilton Film: "Hamilton Goes Hollywood." - Page 10 |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, zombie movie ''[[Resident Evil: Apocalypse]]'' was partly filmed at the Hamilton Cemetery on [[York Boulevard (Hamilton, Ontario)|York Boulevard]], across the street from [[Dundurn Castle]] and Dundurn Park. Also in 2005 the [[Mark Wahlberg]] film ''[[Four Brothers (film)|Four Brothers]]'' was filmed mostly in Hamilton's North End neighbourhoods, north of the [[Canadian National Railway]] lines, and featured [[Stelco]] and [[Dofasco]]'s steel mills as a backdrop. Also that year [[Ron Howard]]'s ''[[Cinderella Man]]'' starring [[Russell Crowe]] filmed the dock workers scene on the boardwalks of one of the piers of [[Hamilton Harbour]].

For the 2006 movie ''[[Man of the Year (2006 film)|Man of the Year]]'', starring Robin Williams and Christopher Walken, some scenes were shot throughout [[Dundas, Ontario]] and most of Downtown Hamilton.

In 2006, the [[Walt Disney|Disney]] film ''[[Firehouse Dog]]'' was filmed at the old [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] headquarters building (1903–1997), on [[Wentworth Street (Hamilton, Ontario)|Wentworth Street North]], (entrance one block east on ''Sanford Avenue'') which featured the firehouse dog jumping off the roof of the burning building.

In 2007, the film ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' was filmed on [[Main Street (Hamilton, Ontario)|Main Street East]] — a two-week night shoot that featured the film's climatic fight scene between the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]]. Temporary buildings were erected by the film's crew on parking lots behind the Royal Connaught Hotel building on the north side of Main as well as across the street on the southwest corner of Main and [[John Street (Hamilton, Ontario)|John Streets]]. The streets of Hamilton were made to look like [[Harlem, New York]].

===Dundas, Ontario===
The DeLuxe Restaurant was a [[nostalgic]] 1950s-style diner found on [[King Street (Dundas, Hamilton, Ontario)|King Street (Dundas)]], used primarily for film shoots. A number of feature films and television productions have been shot there in Dundas.&lt;ref name=DELUXE&gt;{{cite web| title = The Hamilton Spectator: City slaps long-closed DeLuxe Restaurant with notice.

==Film studios==
January 2014 saw the official opening of a new 4000 sq ft film, TV and web series production studio delivering a full service option for the independent filmmaker. Operated by Digital Canaries as one of its 2 Hamilton locations [http://www.digitalcanaries.com/studio ]  and located at 270 Sherman Ave North.  In July 2015, Digital Canaries Studios moved to 520 Burlington St. E., a 66,000 sq ft facility of studio spaces, standing sets, green screens, props and wardrobe department.

In March 2008, a brand new [[film studio]] opened up on 525 [[Parkdale Avenue (Hamilton, Ontario)|Parkdale Avenue North]] called, ''Steel Work Studios''. It was supposed to be a full service film studio with 13 departments to meet the needs of the TV and film industry which included a talent agency for Extra's and talent called, 'Cast In Steel.'.&lt;ref name=STEELWORKS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steelworkstudios.com/ |title= STEEL WORK STUDIOS- 525 Parkdale Avenue North |accessdate=2008-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group involved with Steel Work Studios were very optimistic about the studio noting that in 2007 [[TV]] and film was a $1-billion industry in Ontario and 40% of that was in Hamilton, Ontario.&lt;ref name=STEELWORKS2&gt;{{cite web|url= http://thespec.com/article/341720|title= (www.thespec.com) Hollywood dreams on Parkdale North - New studio aims at share of $1 billion Ontario business (March 2008) |accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later the facility closed down and no official word was given for its closure.

In recent years there has been talk of converting the {{convert|500000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility on [[Victoria Avenue (Hamilton, Ontario)|Victoria Avenue North]] that was one time home of the [[Otis Elevator Company]] and [[Studebaker]] plant into a Mega-Film Studio. In 2004 a group of local [[investors]] were ready to open up the $30-million facility named ''Hamilton Film Studios'' but pulled out two months after it opened up. One of the main reasons was they overestimated the appeal of the site, in that the interior had too many support beams, making the space impractical for productions requiring wide, uninterrupted expanses.&lt;ref name=HAMFILMS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbackonline.ca/articles/magazine/20040621/studio.html |title= (www.playbackonline.ca) Hamilton studio closes doors (June 2004) |accessdate=2008-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the NUVO Network opened its 150,000 square foot facility consisting of 
three state-of-the-art media production studios, podcasting facilities, recording and vlogging studios, alongside editing suites, office spaces, and events venue. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.wireservice.ca/index.php?module=News&amp;func=display&amp;sid=23992&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Great Books Foundation''', incorporated in the state of [[Illinois]] and based in [[Chicago]], is an independent, nonprofit [[educational organization]] whose mission is to help people think and share ideas. Toward this end, the Foundation publishes collections of classic and modern literature as part of a continuum of reading and discussion programs for children and adults. The foundation has two main programs: Junior Great Books, serving students in kindergarten through high school, and Great Books Discussion for college students, continuing education, and Great Books book groups. The organization derives its income from the sale of books, teacher professional development fees, contributions, and grants.

Established in 1947 by a group of prominent citizens led by [[University of Chicago]] Chancellor [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] and [[Mortimer Adler]], the Great Books Foundation began as a grassroots movement to promote continuing liberal education for the general public. In 1960 the Foundation extended its mission to children with the introduction of Junior Great Books. Since its inception, the Foundation has helped thousands of people throughout the U.S. and in foreign countries begin their own discussion groups in schools, libraries, and community centers. Since 2001, the Foundation has published the quarterly magazine ''[[The Common Review]]''.

Great Books discussions use a distinctive discussion method called "Shared Inquiry", in which the leader starts with an [[open-ended question]] about the meaning of a selection and then asks follow-up questions to help participants develop their ideas. Developed by the Great Books Foundation, ''Shared Inquiry'' is related to [[Socratic method|Socratic]] discussion but is distinguished by the fact that the basic discussion question is one to which the leader does not know the answer.

Sixty years after Adler co-founded the Great Books Foundation, it continues to embrace his insistence that the civil discussion of challenging ideas is a powerful source of personal growth and social engagement. But for most of that history and certainly since the introduction of Junior Great Books in 1960, the foundation has rejected Adler's narrow view of "great books" as almost entirely the product of Western males. Despite a common misconception to the contrary, the foundation promotes the reading and discussion of great literature wherever it is found, including literature by outstanding contemporary authors, women authors, and authors from all over the world.

'''Heroin chic''' was a look popularized in mid-[[1990s in fashion|1990s fashion]] and characterized by [[Pallor|pale skin]], [[Periorbital dark circles|dark circles]] underneath the eyes, very skinny body, dark red [[lipstick]] and angular bone structure. The look, characterised by [[emaciated]] features and [[androgyny]], was a reaction against the "[[healthy]]" and vibrant look of models such as [[Cindy Crawford]] and [[Claudia Schiffer]].

At the time during which heroin [[Chic (style)|chic]] emerged, the popular image of [[heroin]] was changing for several reasons. The price of heroin had decreased, and its purity had increased dramatically.&lt;ref name=durrant&gt;Durrant, Russil &amp; Jo Thakker. ''Substance Use &amp; Abuse: Cultural and Historical Perspectives''. Sage Publications (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vCYyDZE2umcC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;sig=xzjPUzu6zRMaT0kFMhWrN-1XaJ8 p87]. {{ISBN|0-7619-2342-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, the [[HIV/AIDS in the United States|AIDS epidemic]] had made injecting heroin with unclean needles increasingly risky.&lt;ref name=durrant/&gt; Available heroin had become more pure, and snorting became a more common mode of heroin use.&lt;ref name=durrant/&gt;   These changes decreased the stigma surrounding the drug, allowing heroin to find a new market among the middle-class and the wealthy, in contrast to its previous base of the poor and marginalized.&lt;ref name=durrant/&gt; Heroin infiltrated pop culture through attention brought to addictions in the early 1990s. In film, the heroin chic trend in fashion coincided with a string of movies in the mid‑1990s—such as ''[[The Basketball Diaries (film)|The Basketball Diaries]]'', ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'', [[Kids (film)|''Kids'']], ''[[Permanent Midnight]]'', and ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''—that examined heroin use and drug culture.&lt;ref&gt;The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.

===Grunge===
{{Main|Grunge}}
In the early 1990s, the rise of the [[grunge]] [[alternative rock]] music and subculture in Seattle brought media attention to the use of heroin by prominent grunge artists. In the 1990s, the media focused on the use of [[heroin]] by musicians in the Seattle grunge scene, with a 1992 ''New York Times'' article listing the city's "three principal drugs" as "[[espresso]], [[beer]] and heroin" &lt;ref name="Marin"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/15/style/grunge-a-success-story.html?pagewanted=all|title= Grunge: A Success Story |last=Marin |first=Rick |date=November 15, 1992 |publisher=The New York Times |access-date=January 29, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1996 article calling Seattle's grunge scene the "...subculture that has most strongly embraced heroin".&lt;ref name=heroin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/heroin.html |title=`Rock 'n' Horse: Rock's Heroin Connection |last=Dasein |first=Deena |date=December 1996 |publisher=Perfect Sound Forever |access-date=January 29, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Jonze from ''The Guardian'' states that "...heroin had blighted the [grunge] scene ever since its inception in the mid-80s" and he argues that the "...involvement of heroin mirrors the self-hating, nihilistic aspect to the music"; in addition to the heroin deaths, Jonze points out that [[Stone Temple Pilots]]' [[Scott Weiland]], as well as [[Courtney Love]], [[Mark Lanegan]] and [[Evan Dando]] "...all had their run-ins with the drug, but lived to tell the tale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/10/deadliest-music-genre-grunge-mike-starr |title=Mike Starr and the deadliest musical genre Another grunge star has died young.

''Drugs in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture. and the Law''. ABC-CLIO, 2014 . p. 888.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading grunge band [[Alice in Chains]] had a song "God Smack", which included the line "stick your arm for some real fun", a reference to injecting heroin.&lt;ref name=heroin/&gt; Seattle grunge musicians known to use heroin included [[Kurt Cobain]], who was using "heroin when he shot himself in the head"; "[[Andrew Wood (singer)|Andrew Wood]] of [[Mother Love Bone]] [, who] overdosed on heroin in 1990"; "[[Stefanie Sargent]] of [[7 Year Bitch]][, who] died of an overdose of the same opiate in 1992...[and] [[Layne Staley]] of [[Alice in Chains]] [who] publicly detailed his battles with heroin...".&lt;ref name=seattletimes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19940420&amp;slug=1906421 |title=`Seattle Scene' And Heroin Use: How Bad Is It? |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=April 20, 1994 |publisher=The Seattle Times |access-date=January 29, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike Starr (musician)|Mike Starr]] of [[Alice in Chains]] &lt;ref name="Marion p. 888"/&gt;  and [[Jonathan Melvoin]] from [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] also died from heroin.

==Rise and fall==
This [[waif]]ish, emaciated look was the basis of the 1993 [[advertising]] campaign of [[Calvin Klein]] featuring [[Kate Moss]].  Film director and actor [[Vincent Gallo]] contributed to the development of the image through his Calvin Klein fashion shoots.&lt;ref&gt;[[Calvin Klein]] special on the Biography channel&lt;/ref&gt;

The trend eventually faded, in part due to the drug-related death of prominent fashion photographer [[Davide Sorrenti]].&lt;ref name="reason"/&gt;  In 1999 ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' dubbed Brazilian supermodel [[Gisele Bündchen]] "The Return of the Sexy Model" and the beginning of a new era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gisele B&amp;#252;ndchen |url=http://www.people.com/people/gisele_bundchen/biography |title=Celebrity Central: Gisele Bundchen biography |publisher=People.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and analysis==
Heroin chic fashion drew much criticism and scorn, especially from anti-drug groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-her1.htm Turns of Phrase: Heroin Chic]&lt;/ref&gt; Fashion designers, models such as [[Kate Moss]] and [[Jaime King]], and movies such as [[Trainspotting (film)|''Trainspotting'']] were blamed for glamorizing heroin use. Then-U.S.&amp;nbsp;president [[Bill Clinton]] condemned the look.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opioids.com/heroin/heroinchic.html President Clinton on Heroin Chic]&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators denied that fashion images made drug use itself more attractive. "There is no reason to expect that people attracted to the look promoted by Calvin Klein and other advertisers... will also be attracted to heroin, any more than suburban teen-agers who wear [[hip hop fashion|baggy pants and backward caps]] will end up [[drive-by shooting|shooting people from moving cars]]", wrote Jacob Sullum in ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="reason"&gt;Sullum, Jacob.

In the Season Nine ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode "[[The Voice (Seinfeld)|The Voice]]", [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry]] asks [[Elaine Benes|Elaine]] about her "somewhat de&amp;#8209;poofed" hair, to which Elaine quips, "It’s the new look.

The '''Indian Head eagle''' was a $10 gold piece or [[eagle (United States coin)|eagle]] struck by the United States Mint continuously from 1907 until 1916, and then irregularly until 1933. The obverse and reverse were designed by sculptor [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]], originally commissioned for use on other denominations. He was suffering from cancer and did not survive to see the coins released.

Beginning in 1904, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] proposed new, more artistic designs on US coins, prompting the Mint to hire Saint-Gaudens to create them.  Roosevelt and Saint-Gaudens at first considered a uniform design for the four denominations of coins which were struck in gold, but in 1907 Roosevelt decided to use a model for the obverse of the eagle that the sculptor had meant to use for the cent.  For the reverse of the $10 coin, the President decided on a design featuring a standing bald eagle that had been developed for the [[Saint-Gaudens double eagle]] $20 coin, while the obverse features a left-facing bust of [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]] wearing an Indian feather headdress.

The coin as sculpted by Saint-Gaudens was too high in relief for the Mint to strike readily, and it took months to modify the design so that the coin could be struck by one blow of the Mint's presses.  Saint-Gaudens died on August 3, 1907, and Roosevelt insisted that the new eagle be finished and struck that month.  New pieces were given to the President on August 31 which differ from the coins struck later for circulation.

The omission of the motto "In God We Trust" on the new coins caused public outrage, and prompted Congress to pass a bill mandating its inclusion.  Mint Chief Engraver [[Charles E. Barber]] added the words and made minor modifications to the design.  The Indian Head eagle was struck regularly until 1916, and then intermittently until President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] directed the Mint to stop producing gold coins in 1933.  Its termination ended the series of eagles struck for circulation begun in 1795.  Many Indian Head eagles were melted by the government in the late 1930s; the 1933 issue is a particular rarity, as few were distributed.

== Inception ==

{{for|additional detail on the origin of the idea for the 1907–1908 United States gold coin redesign|Saint-Gaudens double eagle#Inception}}

In 1904, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] wrote to Secretary of the Treasury [[Leslie Mortier Shaw]] complaining that U.S. coinage lacked artistic merit. He suggested that the treasury engage a private artist to prepare new coin designs, such as sculptor [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]].{{sfn|Burdette|2007|p=19}}  At Roosevelt's direction, the Mint hired Saint-Gaudens to redesign the cent and the four gold pieces: the [[double eagle]] ($20), [[eagle (United States coin)|eagle]] ($10), [[half eagle]] ($5), and [[quarter eagle]] ($2.50).  The Liberty Head design had been first struck for the eagle in 1838;{{sfn|Yeoman|2014|p=268}} the last addition to the Liberty Head gold series was the double eagle, first struck for circulation in 1850.{{sfn|Yeoman|2014|p=275}}  The designs of those pieces had remained unchanged for more than 25 years, and they could be changed without an act of Congress.{{sfn|Burdette|2007|p=20}}

In 1905, Mint Engraver [[Charles E. Barber]] engraved the obverse of Roosevelt's inauguration medal, while his assistant [[George T. Morgan]] engraved the reverse.  Roosevelt disliked the work and engaged Saint-Gaudens to design an unofficial medal commemorating [[Second inauguration of Theodore Roosevelt|the inauguration]].{{sfn|Vermeule|1971|pp=108–109}}  Saint-Gaudens foresaw resistance from Barber on the question of the new coinage; he wrote to his brother Louis, "Barber is a S.O.A.B. [son of a bitch] but I had a talk with the President who ordered Secretary Shaw in my presence to cut Barber's head off if he didn't do our bidding".{{sfn|Moran|2008|p=219}}

[[File:Saint-Gaudens Inaugural medal reverse cutout.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Saint-Gaudens's 1905 inaugural medal reverse contains a standing eagle similar to the one on the $10 piece.]]

Roosevelt was impressed by some models that Saint-Gaudens had prepared for the cent showing a head of Liberty.  In early 1907, he wrote to Saint-Gaudens proposing that an Indian war bonnet be added to the obverse of the cent: "I feel very strongly that on at least one coin we ought to have the Indian feather headdress.  It is distinctly American, and very picturesque.  Couldn't you have just such a head as you have now, but with the feather headdress?"{{sfn|Burdette|2006|pp=83–84}}  Numismatic historian [[Walter Breen]] describes this as "the absurd addition of a feathered warbonnet",{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=558}} and art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]] states that the Indian Head eagle "missed being a great coin because Roosevelt interfered" with its design.{{sfn|Vermeule|1971|p=115}} Nonetheless, Saint-Gaudens added the headdress to the head of Liberty in February 1907.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=84}} He was undecided about which design to use for the gold pieces, which were still intended to have a uniform appearance, and he proposed using the headdress Liberty for the double eagle. Roosevelt tentatively decided to use different designs on the eagle and double eagle, with the eagle to bear the headdress Liberty.  The double eagle would show a Liberty striding forward, with a flying eagle on the reverse.  The President was prepared to meet personally with Saint-Gaudens if he objected, but the sculptor was seriously ill with cancer and no meeting took place.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=209}}

[[File:Saint-Gaudens cent.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint-Gaudens's model of the Liberty design for the cent. Roosevelt insisted on adding a man's Indian feather headdress.]]
Mint Director [[George E. Roberts]] wrote to Saint-Gaudens on May 25, 1907: "It is now settled ... the design for the Eagle shall be the feather head of Liberty with the standing eagle".{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=209}} Saint-Gaudens and his assistants moved quickly on the revision, and he sent models of the new coin on June 1 with a letter stating that the relief of the new models should be coinable by the Mint. The double eagles were then being delayed because Saint-Gaudens had twice sent the Mint models with too high a relief that could not be struck in one blow, as required for circulating coinage.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=98}} His letter was forwarded to the [[Philadelphia Mint]], where Superintendent John Landis had Mint Chief Engraver [[Charles E. Barber]] read and initial it.  On June 7, Barber responded to Landis:

{{quote|I beg to report that I have received two models in plaster and also a copy of a letter from Mr. Saint-Gaudens to the Director, in which there are certain statements that are somewhat misleading ... the relief of the design must conform to the fixed conditions and therefore, the only relief that I knew of was coin relief; the models now sent are not coin relief. ... The date of the year is in Roman notation, there is no provision made for even next year, there being no place left, and as these coins have to stand for twenty-five years before another change can be made, I feel it necessary to state that within a few years it would be impossible to date the dies.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=99}}}}

[[File:Metal double eagle sketch cutout.jpg|thumb|upright|A metal model for the double eagle by Saint-Gaudens; the design was adapted for the eagle]]

Roberts wrote to Saint-Gaudens on June 11 suggesting that there might be problems with the date and the relief; he received no response and wrote again on June 18.  This time the sculptor responded, writing that he had been awaiting the return of his assistant [[Henry Hering]], who had handled much of the dealings with the Mint.  He agreed that Roman numerals were ill-advised for the eagle, and he sent new models to the Mint on June 24. Barber used these models to prepare a die, along with a bronze casting which was produced privately, and the Mint struck experimental pieces on July 19.  These "high relief" pieces required multiple strikes of the press to fully bring up the design.  Saint-Gaudens wrote to the Mint in mid-July, "I am waiting to know about this in order to proceed with the other reliefs", and he was sent one of the new pieces, along with a Liberty Head eagle for comparison.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|pp=100–101}}

On July 19, Roberts sent a similar pair of coins to Secretary of the Treasury [[George Cortelyou]], noting that Saint-Gaudens used a smooth finish to the design rather than the sharp die work characteristic of the Liberty gold pieces, and he suggested that this might encourage counterfeiting.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|pp=100–101}}  Roberts communicated these concerns to Saint-Gaudens, who requested casts of the dies used to strike the new pieces; the casts were sent to his house in [[Cornish, New Hampshire]] on July 28.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=102}}  Saint-Gaudens died there of cancer on August 3, 1907, and Roosevelt wrote to his widow Augusta, "I count it as one of the privileges of my administration to have had him make two of our coins".{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=105}}

== Preparations ==

[[File:Roberts medal.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mint Director George E. Roberts (shown on his Mint medal, designed by Barber) left office on July 31, 1907.]]

Roberts left office on July 31, 1907 to become president of the [[Continental Illinois|Commercial National Bank of Chicago]].  As his successor, [[San Francisco Mint]] Superintendent [[Frank A. Leach]], did not take office until November 1, former Mint Director Robert Preston served as acting director in the interim.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|pp=100–101}}

On August 7, Roosevelt ordered Secretary Cortelyou to have the designs for the eagle and double eagle finalized and in production by September 1.  With Landis on vacation,{{sfn|Moran|2008|p=307}} Cortelyou passed the President's letter on to the acting Philadelphia Mint superintendent, Dr. Albert A. Norris, instructing him to "have this matter taken up at once and the President's instructions carried out; and everything possible must be done to expedite the work."{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=106}}  Preston wrote to Roberts, asking for information about the new coinage, and the former Mint director responded on August 12, outlining the correspondence with Saint-Gaudens, and noting that "no instructions have been received from the President as to the half and quarter eagle, but I expected that the eagle design would be used upon them&amp;nbsp;... The President concluded to leave the One Cent piece unchanged, and there has been no discussion about any change in the Nickel piece."{{sfn|Burdette|2006|pp=106–107}}

In response to the President's instructions, Barber wrote to Norris informing him that the design for the eagle had been awaiting approval since July, making no mention of the Mint's desire for sharper die work.  Norris noted in his subsequent letter to Acting Director Preston that the Mint had been having trouble with the collar, which would strike the edge of the coin and impress 46 stars, representing the number of states there would be after [[Oklahoma]]'s already scheduled admission to the Union later in 1907.  Mint authorities had turned unsuccessfully to their counterparts in Paris for advice, but the Mint's machine shop was able to perfect the collar.{{sfn|Moran|2008|p=301}}  Norris defended Barber in his letter to Preston,

[[File:1907 wire edge eagle cutout.jpg|thumb|upright|1907 "wire rim" eagle]]

{{quote|I think the President does Mr. Barber an injustice when he speaks of "a certain cumbersomeness of mind and inability to do the speediest modern work, as shown by these delays," here.  The making of the models for these coins was given to Saint Gaudens, who was a sculptor and had no experience with coinage designs.  When the models were received, the Bureau [of the Mint] was notified that the dies made from them would not work in the coining press&amp;nbsp;... the models were returned to Saint Gaudens, at his request and a modified set furnished after some time.  The Bureau was informed that even these would not make dies satisfactory for coinage, but the dies were made and it was found they could not be used in the coining press.  How are we going to strike coins from these for the President?{{sfn|Burdette|2006|pp=108–109}}}}

In late August, Augusta Saint-Gaudens sent new models for the eagle to Acting Director Preston.  When Barber examined them, he noted, "dies made from these models would be a great improvement over those already made"{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=113}} and stated that with these models, the Mint could have the eagle in full production within a month.  Homer Saint-Gaudens, the sculptor's son, wrote to Preston, "Mr. Hering has finally finished the eagle at a relief slightly lower than that on the French [gold] coin by Chaplin, [''sic'', actually [[Jules-Clément Chaplain|Chaplain]]] which is the lowest relief that Mr. Hering knew my father would abide by, and which I understand Mr. Barber can mint."{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=113}}  In the meantime, Cortelyou ordered 500 pieces struck on the Mint's high-pressure medal press from the dies the Mint had from Saint-Gaudens's earlier efforts, thus complying with the letter of the President's August 7 order.  Preston sent a note to Norris, warning that the President would likely order 100&amp;nbsp;pieces and suggesting that he have the coins available "so you can furnish them without a moment's delay".{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=115}}  According to numismatic historian Roger Burdette, "these were an 'insurance policy', put in place by Cortelyou against additional presidential rage".{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=117}}  The President viewed sample eagle coins on August 31, and expressed his satisfaction with them and his desire to see more struck.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=115}}

As Saint-Gaudens's design did not include a rim (the raised surface which surrounds each side of a coin), excess metal was forming a "fin" or extrusion from the coin.  The fin was easily broken off, and there was a threat that the eagles would quickly become underweight, diminishing their usefulness as a trade coin.  Barber engraved a rim onto the die, eliminating the problem.{{sfn|Moran|2008|pp=301–302}}

About five hundred pieces had been struck from Saint-Gauden's original dies; these were struck on the medal press and were for the most part distributed to government officials. They are referred to as "wire rim" pieces, denoting the sharp angle at which the field of the coin meets the edge without the intermediary of a rim.{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=559}} They remained available for purchase from the Mint for face value at least until 1912.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=118}}  One sold at auction in January 2011 for $230,000.{{sfn|Roach, 2011-01-17}}  A total of 32,000 eagles were struck using the Barber-modified Saint-Gaudens dies, for the most part using ordinary coinage presses.  These are known as the "rounded rim" pieces.{{sfn|Yeoman|2014|p=274}}  On November 9, 1907, with the dies made from the low relief Saint-Gaudens models in full production, Frank Leach, the new Mint director, decided to have 31,950 of the rounded rim specimens melted, saving only fifty.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|pp=116–117}}  According to Leach in his memoirs, these "were given to museums of art and officials and others connected with the work".{{sfn|Leach|1917|pp=378–381}}  The surviving rounded rim specimens can be readily distinguished from later 1907 strikes, as they have dots before, between, and after the words "Ten Dollars" on the reverse.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|pp=116–117}}  One, which had been in the possession of the Leach family for a century, sold in January 2011 for $2,185,000.{{sfn|Roach, 2011-01-17}}
	 
Mint Director Leach described the pieces in a report to Cortelyou summarizing the redesign project:
 	
{{quote|The obverse of the eagle bears the feathered head of Liberty which was originally intended for the one cent piece.  The President was so pleased with this design that he decided to have it placed on the eagle.  The head, the artist stated, was designed in accordance with the suggestions of the President.  The reverse bears the standing eagle, and on the edge of the coins there are forty-six stars, one for each State.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=149}}}}

== Design ==

[[File:Saint Gaudens victory head.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint-Gaudens' unused model for the statue of Victory]]

Saint-Gaudens based his head of Liberty on a model that he had sculpted but not used for the statue of Victory in the [[William Tecumseh Sherman (Saint-Gaudens)|William Tecumseh Sherman Monument]] in New York City, still believing that the design would be considered for the cent. The bust of Harriet Eugenia Anderson also inspired Saint-Gaudens in his model and bas-relief ''ΝΙΚΗ ΕΙΡΗΝΗ'' (Greek for victory and peace).{{sfn|Burdette|2006|pp=82–83, 302}} His reverse design was an eagle standing on a sheaf of arrows with an olive branch at its feet;{{sfn|Garrett|Guth|2008|p=315}} this was his original concept for the reverse of the double eagle, and it bears a close similarity to his reverse for the inaugural medal.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=75}} His ultimate inspiration for the reverse, by one account, was a coin of [[Ptolemy I of Egypt]] portraying a standing eagle which was illustrated in a book that he owned and had lent to Roosevelt.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=303}}

Jeff Garrett and Ron Guth call the details of the coin "a trifle fantastic".{{sfn|Garrett|Guth|2008|p=314}}  They point to the unlikeliness of any female wearing a head-dress only donned by a male warrior, and they describe the word "LIBERTY" on the headdress as "placed incongruously".{{sfn|Garrett|Guth|2008|p=314}}

== Release and production ==

The new eagles entered circulation around November 4, 1907, although Leach did not receive formal approval to issue the pieces until December 19.{{sfn|Moran|2008|p=321}}

As early as November 7, articles were appearing in newspapers noting the omission of the motto "[[In God We Trust]]" on the eagle, and the Mint soon began to receive many complaints.  Roosevelt believed that using God's name on coins was sacrilegious, and had confirmed with government lawyers that no law required the motto's use.  Saint-Gaudens wanted to include only the minimum of lettering on the new coins, and was content to omit the motto.  According to his son Homer, as Saint-Gaudens considered "the motto 'In God We Trust' as an artistic intrusion not required by law, he wholly discarded [it] and thereby drew down on himself the lightning of public comment".{{sfn|Burdette|2006|pp=193–195}}{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=560}}  The [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] passed a bill ordering the use of the motto on the new eagle and double eagle (which also lacked the phrase) in March 1908; the [[United States Senate|Senate]] followed suit in May.  Roosevelt, finding public opinion against him, signed the bill into law that month.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=197}}  Barber duly placed the motto on the reverse, to the left of the eagle's breast.{{sfn|Garrett|Guth|2008|p=384}}  On the "No Motto pieces" struck at the [[Denver Mint]] in 1908 (catalogued as 1908-D), the [[mintmark]] "D" appears above the leaves near the eagle's feet on the reverse; on the pieces with motto struck both at Denver and at [[San Francisco Mint|San Francisco]] (mintmark S) beginning in 1908, the mintmark appears to the left of the arrow on which the bird stands.{{sfn|Breen|1988|pp=558–560}} Barber also made other, minor changes in the coin; according to Breen, "Aside from the addition of the motto, none of Barber's niggling changes are defensible as improvements, unless one insists that more of the first U of UNUM ''had'' to show. Nor is striking quality increased."{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=560}}

Denver mintmarks from 1908 to 1910 are much larger than those in subsequent years; San Francisco mintmarks are consistently small.{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=560}}  With the admission of [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]] as states in 1912, the number of stars on the edge was increased from 46 to 48.{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=560}}

The coin was struck every year from 1907 to 1916.{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=561}}  During World War I, with gold coins commanding a premium above face value and many gold pieces returning from Europe to pay for war materials, there was little need for new gold coins;{{sfn|Bowers|2004|p=240}} coinage of eagles was discontinued after 1916.{{sfn|Garrett|Guth|2008|p=391}}  Subsequently, Indian Head eagles were struck only in 1920 (at San Francisco), 1926 (at Philadelphia), 1930 (at San Francisco), and final Philadelphia issues in 1932 and 1933.{{sfn|Garrett|Guth|2008|pp=391–393}}  In March 1933, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] ordered that no more gold in the form of coins be released from the Treasury; the Mint subsequently stopped its production of gold coins, ending the eagle series that had begun in 1795.{{sfn|Fuljenz|2010|p=234}}

On December 28, 1933, Acting Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]] ordered Americans to turn in all gold coins and gold certificates, with limited exceptions, receiving paper money in payment.{{sfn|Bowers|2004|pp=277–278}}  Millions of gold coins were melted down by the Treasury in the following years.  Many of the gold coins seen today had been exported to Europe before 1933 and repatriated once restrictions on holding gold were ended.{{sfn|Lange|2006|p=165}}

== Collecting ==

[[File:Pt eagle.png|thumb|upright|Saint-Gaudens is said to have been given inspiration for his standing eagle design from this illustration of an Ancient Egyptian coin.]]

With the exception of the 1907 high relief pieces, no date or mintmark of the circulation strikes of the Indian Head eagle before 1920 is particularly rare.{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=560}}  The 1911-D, with a mintage of 30,100 commands a significant premium in [[mint state]] or uncirculated condition, but only a modest one in circulated grades.{{sfn|Garrett|Guth|2008|p=387}}  Despite its mintage of 126,500, the 1920-S is a major rarity.  It was little collected at the time, and with Europe still recovering from the war, few coins were exported there; accordingly, most were melted post-1933.{{sfn|Garrett|Guth|2008|p=391}}  Only a handful of 1933 eagles were distributed before Roosevelt ended the paying out of gold, and virtually the entire mintage of 312,500 was melted.  One sold in 2004, graded [[Mint state|MS-66]] (the finest example of this date known) for $718,750.{{sfn|Garrett|Guth|2008|p=393}}  Approximately forty 1933 eagles are known to have survived.{{sfn|Fuljenz|2010|p=235}}

[[Proof coin]]s were struck from 1907 until 1915, all at Philadelphia.  Not all quantities are known, but the highest for which the number struck is known is 1910, with a mintage of 204 (one sold for $80,500 in 2006).  One of the surviving specimens of the mostly melted rounded rim pieces is in proof; this unique specimen is in private hands.{{sfn|Garrett|Guth|2008|pp=418–422}}  Numismatic expert Mike Fuljenz, in his book on the gold pieces with Indian designs struck in the early 20th century, suggests that this coin was a trial piece, resulting from the test of new dies.{{sfn|Fuljenz|2010|p=175}}  Different finishes are known for the proof coins.  The unique 1907 piece is in satin proof (the raised designs appear like satin), but later proof eagles were struck in a dark [[gloss (material appearance)|matte]] finish.  Some 1908–1910 proof eagles were struck in a lighter "Roman finish".{{sfn|Garrett|Guth|2008|pp=418–422}}

'''[[Intellectual property]]''' (IP) consists of four kinds: [[patent]], [[trademark]], [[copyright]], and [[trade secret]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bramson|first=R.S.|date=1981|title=Intellectual property as collateral — patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights.|url=|journal=The Business Lawyer|volume=36|pages=1567-1604|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to understand these areas and use them correctly, a person needs to be trained and educated. That training may be delivered through various types of resources, including webinars, college courses, webpages, and books. Intellectual property education should teach the individual what these areas are, what aspects of the law apply to them, and how to understand normal situations which might arise regarding those specific area.  Because of its importance, intellectual property education should be available to people of all age groups and education levels. Because intellectual property laws are specific to each country, training on the topic is also specific to each country.

Copyright protects original expression of ideas in different forms, but not the ideas themselves. The goal of copyright law is to encourage individual and business entities to produce original work by rewarding them with exclusive rights for their benefits, which is subject to time and statutory exceptions.

As outlined in the United States Copyright Office's guide, [https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf Circular 1: Copyright Basics]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;United States Copyright Office, Library of Congress. (2017).  ''Copyright Basics'' (Circular 1). Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt;, a work is given copyright protection once it is fixed within a tangible medium, which includes "written works, musical works, dramatic works, pantomimes and choreographic works, pictorial works, graphic works, sculptural works, motion pictures and other audiovisual works, sound recordings, and architectural works." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The copyright protection given to the work provides the owner of the work with specific rights including the right to reproduce the work, the right to create a derivative work, the right to perform the work, the right to display the work, and the right to distribute copies of the work. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Governing Laws of Copyright ==

=== Constitution ===
United States copyrights law is based in U.S. Constitution, which authorizes Congress to provide authors with certain exclusive rights in their writings for a limited period of time.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/10617&lt;/nowiki&gt; U.S.C.A. § 106&lt;/ref&gt; The "writings" is a broad term, which means any work of original expression in any form or medium, including literary, artistic, musical and etc.. "Authors" is also a broad term, which includes all creators of works.

=== Copyright Act of 1976 ===
Copyright law is primarily governed by federal statute and the current controlling statute is Copyright Act of 1976, as amended.[https://www.copyright.gov/title17/title17.pdf] Under the [[Supremacy Clause|Supremacy Clause of Constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Const. art. 6, cl. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;, with few exceptions, the Copyright Act of 1976 preempts state law.

=== Regulations ===
The US Copyright Office administers copyrights authorized by the Copyright Act, whose functions include rulemaking, regulate copyright registration, administering statutory and compulsory licenses. It also provides legal and regulatory background information as well as procedural guidance on its [https://copyright.gov/ website].

=== TEACH Act ===
The federal [[TEACH Act]] (Technology, Education, and Copyright Harmonization Act of 2002) was signed in November 2002, and governs the use of copyrighted materials in online learning environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://copyright.cornell.edu/teach-act|title=New Copyright Legislation (TEACH Act) {{!}} Copyright Information Center|website=copyright.cornell.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TEACH Act eases some of the rules put in place by the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://er.educause.edu/articles/2006/1/managing-intellectual-property-for-distance-learning|title=Managing Intellectual Property for Distance Learning|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities, including the University of Washington,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/uwcopy/Copyright_Law/TEACH_Act/|title=UW Copyright Connection : TEACH Act : TEACH Act|website=depts.washington.edu|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide information about compliance with the TEACH Act, often related to the use of [[Learning management system|learning management systems]]

=== State Law ===
Though the Copyright Act preempts state law, state law covers the issues which is outside the scope of Copyright Act, such as works of authorship that have not been expressed in a tangible medium(outside of scope of "[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102 fixed in any tangible medium of expression]"&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 102(a)&lt;/ref&gt;), right not equivalent to any of the "[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106 exclusive rights]"&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 106&lt;/ref&gt;, etc..

=== International Copyright Treaties ===
International copyright treaties between U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions is enforceable in U.S. territory under the Supremacy Clause, including: [[Berne Convention|The Berne Convention]], [[Universal Copyright Convention|The Universal Copyright Convention]], [[WIPO Copyright Treaty|The WIPO Copyright Treaty]], [[WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty|The WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty]], [[Geneva Phonograms Convention|The Geneva Phonograms Convention]] and [[TRIPS Agreement|TRIPS]]. While their specific terms are different, two fundamental rules govern each member under each treaty: member countries must meet certain minimum standards for copyright protection in their local law and provide reciprocal treatment to copyright owners in other member jurisdictions. The copyright law provided by each jurisdiction is based on its own national laws.

== Popular Topics ==

=== Fair Use ===
[[Fair use]] is one important topic in Copyright and Intellectual Property Education. Fair use law allows for limited use of copyrighted materials without seeking and/or acquiring copyright clearance from the copyright owner. There are four factors of fair use: (1) the purpose and character of the use, (2) the nature of the copyrighted work, (3) the amount or portion used of the work, and (4) the effect of the use&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/461034081|title=Copyright and cultural institutions: Guidelines for digitization for U.S. libraries, archives, and museums|last=Hirtle|first=Peter, B.|date=|publisher=Cornell University Library|others=Hudson, Emily., &amp; Kenyon, Andrew T.|year=2009|isbn=9780935995107|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|pages=|oclc=461034081}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Faculty, staff, and students may find a [https://copyright.columbia.edu/basics/fair-use/fair-use-checklist.html#Fair%20Use%20Checklist Fair Use Checklist] helpful when determining whether or not their use of a material would fall under fair use. Columbia University Libraries' [https://copyright.columbia.edu/index.html Copyright Advisory Services] provides their own [https://copyright.columbia.edu/basics/fair-use/fair-use-checklist.html#Fair%20Use%20Checklist Fair Use Checklist] and information about fair use law, as well as other information regarding copyright&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://copyright.columbia.edu/index.html|title=Copyright Advisory Services|last=|first=|date=|website=Columbia University Libraries|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

For further clarification on Fair Use and how to determine if a person's use falls under that exception, Stanford University has a [https://fairuse.stanford.edu/charts-and-tools/ Charts and Tools] section on their website. This website includes links to codes of best practices - including the Center for Media &amp; Social Impact's [http://cmsimpact.org/code/code-best-practices-fair-use-media-literacy-education/ Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Media Literacy Education], a [http://dirc.vraweb.org/ Digital Image Rights Computator] to help a user discover if an image they wish to use is copyrighted, and a [http://navigator.carolon.net/ Copyright Navigator] that provides basic information on how copyright law works. Each of the links on the website equips a user with enough resources to determine if their use of a copyrighted material falls under the protection of Fair Use.

The legislative intent for fair use in Section 107 in Copyright Act is stated as following: "the bill endorses the purpose and general scope of the judicial doctrine of fair use, but there is no disposition to freeze the doctrine in the statute, especially during a period of rapid technological change. Beyond a very broad statutory explanation of what fair use is and some of the criteria applicable to it, the courts must be free to adapt the doctrine to particular situations on a case-by-case basis. Section 107 is intended to restate the present judicial doctrine of fair use, not to change, narrow, or enlarge it in any way."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://law.resource.org/pub/us/works/aba/ibr/H.Rep.94-1476.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; H.R. REP. 94-1476, 66, 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5680&lt;/ref&gt;  It means courts have broad discretion to decide fair use application. U.S. Copyright Office creates a [https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/fair-index.html Fair Use Index] which summarizes the newest case law development in fair use. 

=== Public Domain ===
[[Public Domain]] is another important concept in Copyright and Intellectual Property Education. If a work is in public domain - i.e., if its copyright has expired, been lost, or was never given - that work may be used by anyone. In order to help determine if a work is in Public Domain, Cornell University provides a [https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain Public Domain Flow Chart] to help users identify if a work is protected by copyright law. Stanford University Libraries' guide, [https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome/ Welcome to the Public Domain], also provides in-depth information that can help users identify how a work enters the public domain based on the date it was published. For example, within the United States, all works that were created prior to 1923 are currently within the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford University Libraries (2018). Copyright &amp; Fair Use: Welcome to the Public Domain. ''Stanford University''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In order to further understand copyright and public domain, the [https://soundcloud.com/user-864134809 Copy This Podcast] provides listeners with a brief history of Copyright Law and Public Domain. Each podcast is approximately twelve minutes long and covers topics such as "[https://soundcloud.com/user-864134809/pop-culture-and-the-public-domain Pop Culture and the Public Domain]," "[https://soundcloud.com/user-864134809/you-use-it-more-than-you-realize Fair Use: You Use It More Than You Realize]," and "[https://soundcloud.com/user-864134809/notice-and-takedown-leave-it-be Notice and Takedown: Leave it Be]." Each of these podcasts features experts and scholars of copyright law and can provide users with information about how to navigate the world of copyright. 

=== Orphan Works ===
[[Orphan work|Orphan works]], or works where the creator or rightsholder is unable to be determined, are an important current topic in copyright law. There is currently no legislation in the United States place to fully address this issue, though progress has been made specifically for music with the [[Music Modernization Act]] in 2018. 

After the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], copyright holders were no longer required to register copyrighted works, which benefited copyright holders by simplifying the process to obtain and maintain copyright protection, but in turn complicated the process for potential users of copyrighted material to determine ownership over certain works as the central register for copyrighted materials was no longer deemed necessary. This made any usage of copyrighted materials outside of fair use a violation of copyright, but did not take into account the drastic changes of access and dissemination that would soon occur due to digitization and the internet. 

In 2006 the U.S. Copyright Office held a study and released a report on orphan works&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/orphan/orphan-report.pdf|title=Report on Orphan Works|last=A Report of the Register of Copyrights|first=|date=January 2006|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The main conclusion was that new legislation was needed to address this issue, and that clearly delineated steps need to be identified for potential users of such works, as well as protocols set in place for when an author comes forward. 

Another report, ‘Orphan Works and Mass Digitization&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/orphan/reports/orphan-works2015.pdf|title=Orphan Works and Mass Digitization|last=A Report of the Register of Copyrights|first=|date=June 2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;’ was completed in 2012 with particular focus on how how efforts to preserve copyrighted material needed to be balanced with reasonable access to the work. This report laid out the prospective changes needed to alter the outdated legislation and better serve current informational needs. 

It is also important to note that in 2013, the UK passed a copyright act&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/copyright-orphan-works|title=Guidance: Copyright: orphan works|last=Intellectual Property Office|first=|date=May 2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that permitted usage of orphan works as long as a diligent effort was made and certain conditions were met, such as filing a ‘notice of use’ for the work.

{{love sidebar|cultural}}
Judaism offers a variety of views regarding the love of God, love among human beings, and love for non-human animals.  Love is a central value in [[Jewish ethics]] and [[Jewish theology]].

== Love among human beings ==
One of the core commandments of Judaism is "Love your neighbor as yourself"  (Leviticus 19:18), sometimes called the [[Great Commandment]].  This commandment stands at the center of the central book in the Torah.&lt;ref&gt;Bamberger 1981: 737, 889&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Talmud]]ic sages Hillel and [[Rabbi Akiva]] indicated that this is the central commandment of the Torah. The commandment emboldens individuals to treat each other as equals which requires first valuing oneself in order to be able to mirror that love onto others. Similarly, another significant commandment is to “not stand idly by the blood of your neighbor” (Leviticus 19:16), which can be exhibited in many forms. Some Jewish sources have emphasized the importance of self-sacrifice in regards to putting our needs second to another's, but Rabbi Akiva's teaching of "Your own life takes precedence to that of another," contradicts his own principle of loving thy neighbor as thyself.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Lenn Evan. ''Love Thy Neighbor as Thyself''. Oxford ; New York: Oxford University Press, 2008, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

This commandment of love, with the preceding sentence, "Thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people," may originally have referred, and has by some scholars (Stade, "Gesch. des Volkes Israel," i. 510a) been exclusively referred, to the Israelitish neighbor; but in verse 34 of the same chapter it is extended to "the stranger that dwelleth with you . . . and thou shalt love him as thyself." In Job xxxi. 13–15 it is declared unjust to wrong the servant in his cause: "Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?"&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia1"&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1509&amp;letter=B Brotherly Love]. JewishEncyclopedia.com. Retrieved on 2014-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romantic love is included in the command to love one's neighbor, but romantic love ''per se'' is not a central topic in classical Jewish literature.  Some medieval rabbinic authorities such as [[Judah Halevi]] wrote romantic poetry in Arabic, though some say that Halevi regretted his romantic poetry, which he wrote in his younger years.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Classical rabbinic literature===
Commenting upon the command to love the neighbor (Lev. l.c.) is a discussion recorded (Sifra, Ḳedoshim, iv.; compare Gen. R. xxiv. 5) between [[Rabbi Akiva]], who declared this verse in Leviticus to contain the great principle of the Law ("Kelal gadol ba-Torah"), and [[Ben Azzai]], who pointed to Gen. v. 1 ("This is the book of the generations of Adam; in the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him"), as the verse expressing the leading principle of the Law, obviously because the first verse gives to the term "neighbor" its unmistakable meaning as including all men as being sons of Adam, made in the image of God. Tanḥuma, in [[Genesis Rabbah]] l.c., explains it thus: "If thou despisest any man, thou despisest God who made man in His image."&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia1"/&gt;

Hillel also took the Biblical command in this universal spirit when he responded to the heathen who requested him to tell the Law while standing before him on one foot: "What is hateful to thee, thou shalt not do unto thy neighbor. This is the whole of the Law, the rest is only commentary" (Shab. 31a). The negative form was the accepted Targum interpretation of Lev. xix. 18, known alike to the author of Tobit iv. 15 and to Philo, in the fragment preserved by Eusebius, "Preparatio Evangelica," viii. 7 (Bernays' "Gesammelte Abhandlungen," 1885, i. 274 et seq.); to the Didache, i. 1; Didascalia or Apostolic Constitutions, i. 1, iii. 15; Clementine Homilies, ii. 6; and other ancient patristic writings (Resch, "Agrapha," pp.&amp;nbsp;95, 135, 272). To include all men, Hillel used the term "beriot" (creatures [compare κτίσις]; Mark xvi. 15; Rom. viii. 19) when inculcating the teaching of love: "Love the fellow-creatures" (Abot i. 12). Hatred of fellow-creatures ("sinat ha-beriyot") is similarly declared by R. Joshua b. Hananiah to be one of the threethings that drive man out of the world (Abot ii. 11; compare I John iii. 15).&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia1"/&gt;

The Talmud insists, with reference to Lev. xix. 18, that even the criminal at the time of execution should be treated with tender love (Sanh. 45a). As Schechter in "J. Q. R." x. 11, shows, the expression "Ye have heard . . ." is an inexact translation of the rabbinical formula, which is only a formal logical interrogation introducing the opposite view as the only correct one: "Ye might deduce from this verse that thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy, but I say to you the only correct interpretation is, Love all men, even thine enemies."&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia1"/&gt; According to Ahad Ha-am, the Torah's phrasing of "thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself" is negative because it creates a "perfect equilibirum, with no leaning either to your side or to your neighbour's."&lt;ref&gt;Ha-Am, Ahad. “Judaism and the Gospels.” ''In Ten Essays on Zionism and Judaism'', translated by Leon Simon, 241. New York: Arno Press, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tanna debe Eliyahu]] R. xv. it is said: "Blessed be the Lord who is impartial toward all. He says: 'Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor. Thy neighbor is like thy brother, and thy brother is like thy neighbor.'" Likewise in xxviii.: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God"; that is, thou shalt make the name of God beloved to the creatures by a righteous conduct toward Gentiles as well as Jews (compare [[Sifre]], Deut. 32).&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia1"/&gt;

===Kabbalistic and Hasidic sources===
[[Ḥayyim Vital]], the [[kabbalist]], in his "Sha'are Ḳedushah," i. 5 teaches that the law of love of the neighbor includes the non-Israelite as well as the Israelite.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia1"/&gt;  A similar view was taught by Aaron b. Abraham ibn Ḥayyim of the sixteenth century, in his commentary to Sifre and by Moses Ḥagis of the eighteenth century, in his work on the 613 commandments, while commenting on Deut. xxiii. 7.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia1"/&gt;

One of the main tenets of [[Hasidic philosophy|Hassidut]] is that all that everything in the universe exists only because the Creator wills it to exist. Therefore, the existence of even the most vile and wicked human beings are a manifestation of Hashem's will, and ultimately, their physical survival is due to that same divine energy that allows the entire creation to survive. And even though it is indeed a positive commandment to despise evil, the true [[tzaddik]] understands that the existence of even the most wicked human beings are in accordance with the Creator's will. This understanding is tantamount to love, as it stems from a love of Hashem and his ways. According to [[Nachman of Breslov|R' Nachman]], this is the ''sod'' of "[[Purim|Ad delo yada bein arur Haman le'varuch Mordechai]]".

Some Jews, however, have criticized Kabbalistic and Hasidic views of love.

===Musar movement===
One of the leaders of the Musar movement, Rabbi [[Simcha Zissel Ziv]], put much emphasis on love.

A later Musar movement leader, the 20th-century rabbi [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]] is frequently quoted as defining love from the Jewish point-of-view as "giving without expecting to take" (''Kuntres ha-Chesed'', Heb. קונטרס החסד Pamphlet [on the topic] of [[Chessed|Lovingkindness]] from his ''Michtav me-Eliyahu'', vol. I).

===Modern Jewish views===
The synod at Leipsic in 1869, and the German-Israelitish Union of Congregations in 1885, stood on old historical ground when declaring that "'Love thy neighbor as thyself' is a command of all-embracing love, and is a fundamental principle of the Jewish religion."&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazarus, ''Ethics of Judaism'', i. 234, 302&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Jewish Debates on Love and Justice===
The 20th-century Jewish theologian [[Will Herberg]] argued that "justice" is at the heart of the Jewish notion of love, and the foundation for Jewish law: 
:The ultimate criterion of justice, as of everything else in human life, is the divine imperative—the law of love .... Justice is the institutionalization of love in society .... This law of love requires that every man be treated as a Thou, a person, an end in himself, never merely as a thing or a means to another's end.  When this demand is translated into laws and institutions under the conditions of human life in history, justice arises.&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Herberg]], ''Judaism and Modern Man'', 1951: 148&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish tradition often encourages the elimination of “otherness” instead for all to see each other as moral counterparts and emphasizes the obligation to render aid and intervene autonomously, doing the right thing because it’s right, not in a heteronomous way, doing the right thing because we feel we must. The tradition teaches not to simply love, but to tolerate in order to be able to achieve justice.

Contemporary rabbi [[Jill Jacobs (rabbi)|Jill Jacobs]] has emphasized that the limits of love as a motivation for giving to others.  As a way to extend one's hand to the community, one can give Tzedakah, or charity, which comes from the word Tzedek meaning justice, compassion and mercy. As an obligation, one must give to the poor “as a means of restoring justice to the world…not as an altruistic or voluntary gesture.” A way to outwardly and tangibly exhibit love is by giving. For example, giving money out of “passion for causes, out of love or concern for others, out of gratitude for our own good fortune, and out of desire to create a better world for ourselves and our children.” By giving to the community, one can demonstrate love outwardly while also embracing it inwardly.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Jill. ''There shall be no needy: Pursuing Social Justice Through Jewish Law &amp; Tradition''''. ''Woodstock, Vt.: Jewish Lights, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Love has also been expressed as being the selflessness of mankind (Louis Jacobs, Greater Love Hath No Man). Humans have the capacity to self-sacrifice in the interest of others, as every life is valuable and unique. When one risks his or her own life to save another, it is seen as an act of piety and an act of love and justice which “advocates the most excessive altruism…” (Greater Love Hath No Man). In order to be selfless then, one must be able to “attach moral value to the individual as such, without any distinction between the self and the other.”&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Louis. “Greater Love Hath No Man: The Jewish Point of View of Self-Sacrifice.” In Contemporary Jewish Ethics, edited by Menachem Marc Kellner, 175-83. New York: Sanhedrin Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish tradition finds validity to the idea of love as well as the acts that supplement it. These acts are centered on ideas widely associated with love in many different traditions such as kindness, respect, compassion, and empathy.  There is inherent value to every soul because they are human. Rabbi Laurie Zoloth-Dorfman states, “The conscience can be said, then, not to be the speaking of the voice within but rather the hearing of the quiet voice of the other, this voice, just as clearly as one’s “own,” must remind us to see each child as our own, each journey and each need as fundamentally shared.” Rather than finding compassion within oneself, we are obligated to find compassion from our empathy and natural connectedness to others. This love for one’s neighbor because they are ones neighbor is an important theme seen in modern views of love in Jewish ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Zoloth -Dorfman, Laurie. “An Ethics of Encounter: Public Choices and Private Acts.” In Contemporary Jewish Ethics and Morality: A Reader, edited by Elliot N. Dorff and Louis E. Newman. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Love can be expressed in a myriad of ways in the Jewish tradition. One way is putting others before oneself. There are several arguments to do this, but one of the most compelling is because one does not know the value of their life.  Rabbi Louis Jacobs states, “But no human being can know which life is of greater value. Hence, it is forbidden to save one’s life by committing murder.”  Some interpretations state that each person is of different value based on a set of variables that are difficult to quantify. There is love to be found in sacrificing oneself because of an understanding that someone else’s life could be more valuable to the world or to God.  Rabbi David Novak states “Rather, many a Jewish source maintains that God affords every human being the opportunity to choose his or her moral fate, and will then judge him or her, and choose whether to love him or her, on the basis of that decision.” In this way, God can decide whether to love a person based on their decisions in the same way a person can choose to love another person.  This idea of God with holding love is not necessarily the predominant one in the modern Jewish tradition, but it is an important concept in the discussion of love and Jewish ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Novak, David. “A Jewish Argument for Socialized Medicine.” Kennedy Institute of
Ethics Journal 13, no. 4 (2004): 313 –28. Jacobs, Louis. “Greater Love Hath No Man... The Jewish Point of View on Self-Sacrifice.” In Contemporary Jewish Ethics, edited by Menachem Marc Kellner, 175–83. New York: Sanhedrin Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Love for animals==

Some Jewish sources also highlight the importance of love and compassion for non-human animals.  Thus, for example, the Jewish philosopher Lenn Goodman speaks of how laws regarding the suffering of animals ideally "create a sensibility of love and kindness."&lt;ref&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman, "Respect for Nature in the Jewish Tradition," in ''Judaism and Ecology: Created World and Revealed Word'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Hava Tirosh-Samuelson, a Jewish historian believed that at the core of Judaism the covenantal model between the Jewish people, God, and the Land of Israel, explains our “obligation to respond to the needs of the other."&lt;ref&gt;Benstein, Jeremy. ''The Way into Judaism and the Environment''. Woodstock, Vt: Jewish Lights, 2006, 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Tirosh-Samuelson thought about the possible meanings when this model was expanded to include the earth as a whole, showing the importance of treating all living creatures with respect. There is a story in the Talmud on how [[Judah HaNasi]] was struck with pain because he did not show mercy to a calf being led to slaughter, and only after saving a mouse's nest he was forgiven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/treatment-of-animals/ Treatment of animals], Times of Israel 19-06-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Love between God and human beings==

Deuteronomy 6: 4–5 commands: "Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God; the Lord is one.  You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might."

===Classical rabbinic literature===
The commandment to love God in Deut. 6 is taken by the [[Mishnah]] (a central text of the Jewish [[oral law]]) to refer to good deeds, willingness to sacrifice one's life rather than commit certain serious transgressions, willingness to sacrifice all one's possessions and being grateful to the Lord despite adversity (tractate Berachoth 9:5, tractate Sanhedrin 74a). [[Rabbinic literature]] differs how this love can be developed.

The love of God means the surrounding of life with his commandments (Men. 43b) and is conditioned by the love of the Torah (R. H. 4a).  Israel is said to love him, giving their very lives for the observance of his commandments (Mek., Yitro, 6, to Ex. xx. 6). Indeed, love of God is voluntary surrender of life and all one has for God's honor (Sifre, Deut. 32; Ber. 54a). It is unselfish service of God (Abot i. 3; 'Ab Zarah 19a). There are chastisements of love for the righteous to test their piety (Ber. 5a; comp. Rom. v. 3). It is this unequaled love, braving suffering and martyrdom, which established the unique relation between God and Israel, so that "none of the nations can quench this love" (Cant. R. viii. 7). This unique love is echoed also in the liturgy (see Ahabah Rabbah). To be a true "lover of God," however, means "to receive offense, and resent not; to hear words of contumely, and answer not; to act merely from love, and rejoice even in trials as tests of pure love" (Shab. 88b; Soṭah 31a; comp. Rom. viii. 28).&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia2"&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=562&amp;letter=L LOVE]. JewishEncyclopedia.com. Retrieved on 2014-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahya Ibn Pakuda===
Love of God is accentuated as the highest incentive of action by [[Baḥya ibn Paḳuda]], in "Ḥobot ha-Lebabot" (see Jew. Encyc. ii. 454).&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia2"/&gt; In ''Duties of the Heart'', the Jewish philosopher maintained that love of God is the ultimate goal and must be the aim of all virtues.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Judaism: History, Belief and Practice|last=Cohn-Sherbok|first=Dan|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2003|isbn=9780415236614|location=New York|pages=444}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahya defined this love as the soul's longing for the creator and this is also made possible through the fear of God, which allows people to abstain from worldly desires.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It appears that fear is linked to love in the sense that it stems from the contemplation of God's power and greatness, which could result to emotional attachment seen in parts of the [[Psalms|Psalm]] and elsewhere in the [[Bible]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Judaism|last=de Lange|first=Nicholas|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521460735|location=Cambridge|pages=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a religious person empties himself of the love for material things, he then opens himself up to be filled with the love of God. These arguments led some observers to describe Bahya's concept of love towards the creator as more focused on the emotion instead of putting emphasis on the [[Rationality|rational]] or [[Mysticism|mystical]] aspects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Love towards other people and even animals could fall within Bahya's framework when approached from his view that we cannot know God as He is in Himself and that it is only through his creatures that we can gain an apprehension of the Divine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fifty Key Jewish Thinkers|last=Cohn-Sherbock|first=Dan|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=0203433025|location=London|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maimonides===
Maimonides, in his [[Mishneh Torah]], devotes the whole tenth chapter of Hilkot Teshubah, with reference to Abot i. 3, to love of God as the motive which gives all human action its true ethical and religious value. [[Maimonides]] wrote that it should only be out of love for God, rather than fear of punishment or hope for reward, that Jews should obey the law: "When man loves God with a love that is fitting he automatically carries out all the precepts of love".&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides ''Yad'' Chapter 10, quoted in Jacobs 1973: 159&lt;/ref&gt; Maimonides thinks that love of God can be developed by contemplating Divine deeds or witnessing the marvels of nature ([[Maimonides]], ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', Hilchot Yesoday HaTorah, Chapter 2).

===Nahmanides===
[[Naḥmanides]] in his commentary to Deut. vi. 4, with reference to Sifre, l.c., declares that love of God involves the study and observance of the Law without regard to gain or expectation of reward; so also Baḥya ben Asher, in his "Kad ha-Ḳemaḥ," under "Ahabah."&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia2"/&gt;

===Eleazar of Worms===
R. [[Eleazar of Worms]], in his ethical work "Roḳeaḥ," begins with the chapter on love, referring to Sifre, Deut. 32, 41, 48; Ber. 54a; Yoma 86a; Ned. 62a; Soṭah 31a; Tanna debe Eliyahu xxvi.; Midr. Teh. to Ps. xiii. 2 ("I love Thee; that is, 'I love Thy creatures'"); and Midr. Tadshe xii., and stating that he who truly loves God subordinates all other desires and cares to the one great object of life—the fulfilment of God's will in joy.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia2"/&gt;

===Kabbalistic views===
Still more extensively does [[Elijah de Vidas]], in his ethical work "Reshit Ḥokmah" (part 2), dwell on love of God as the highest aim and motive of life. He also quotes the Zohar (i. 11b; ii. 114, 116a; iii. 68a, 264b, 267a; and other passages), where it is frequently stated that pure love is suppression of all care for self, and through such love true union of the soul with God is effected. This union is said by the [[Kabbalists]] to take place in the celestial "palace of love" (Zohar i. 44b, ii. 97a).&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia2"/&gt;

===Crescas===
Still greater importance was attached to love when it was rendered a cosmic principle in the philosophical systems of [[Hasdai Crescas]] and, through him, of [[Spinoza]]. Instead of rendering the creative intellect the essence of the Deity, as did [[Maimonides]] and all the [[Aristotelians]], [[Crescas]], like [[Philo]], makes love the essential quality of God. Love is divine bliss, and hence love of God is the source of eternal bliss for mortal man.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Or Adonai," i. 3, 5; comp. Spinoza's "Amor Intellectualis," v. 32–36; see Joël, "Don Chasdai Creskas' Religionsphilosophische Lehren," 1866, p. 37; idem, "Spinoza's Theologisch-Politischer Tractat," 1870, pp. ix.-xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judah Leon Abravanel===
But, more than Crescas, it was probably [[Judah Leon Abravanel]] from whom Spinoza borrowed the idea of "intellectual love" as a cosmic principle, and who, following the Platonic and pantheistic tendency of the period of the Italian Renaissance, made (in his "Dialoghi di Amore") the "amore intellectivo" and "amore mentale" or "rationale" the essence of God and the central force and end of the world. "Love links all things together in the cosmos, but while love in the natural world is sensual and selfish, divine love is unselfish and uplifting. God's love created the world and brings about the perfection of all things, especially of man, who, when good, is God-loving as well as God-beloved, and whose love of God leads him to eternal bliss, which is identical with divine love." This intellectual love is identical with the Biblical "to him [God] shalt thou cleave" (Deut. x. 20, xi. 22, xiii. 5; Sifre, Deut. 49; Soṭah 14a) and gives rise to the "imitatio Dei." It is highest perfection and supreme joy&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Zimmels, "Leo Hebræus," 1886, especially pp. 51, 67, 74–79, 89–100&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abravanel]]'s view of love as the principle of the world appears to have exerted some influence also upon Schiller in his "Philosophische Briefe" (1838, x. 289)&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmels, l.c. pp. 8–11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Franz Rosenzweig===
{{Cleanup|section|date=December 2010}}
The 20th-century Jewish philosopher [[Franz Rosenzweig]] described divine love as cleansing:

:It is not God that need cleanse it [the soul of the beloved, i.e. Israel] of its sin.  Rather it cleanses itself in the presence of his love.  It is certain of God's love in the very moment that shame withdraws from it and it surrenders itself in free, present admission — as certain as if God had spoken into its ear that "I forgive" which is longed for earlier when it confessed to him its sins of the past.  It no longer needs this formal absolution.  It is freed of its burden at the very moment of daring to assume all of it on its shoulders.  So too the beloved no longer needs the acknowledgment of the lover which she longed for before she admitted her love.  At the very moment when she herself dares to admit it, she is as certain of his love as if he were whispering his acknowledgment into her ear.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenzweig, 180–181&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenzweig described the Hebrew Bible as a "grammar of love" in which God can communicate "I love you" only by demanding "You must love me," and Israel can communicate "I love you" only by confessing "I have sinned."  Therefore, this confession does not lead God to offer an unnecessary absolution; it merely expresses Israel's love for God.  "What then is God's answer to this 'I am thine' by which the beloved soul acknowledges him" if it is not "absolution?"  Rosenzweig's answer is: revelation: "He cannot make himself known to the soul before the soul has acknowledged him.  But now he must do so.  For this it is by which revelation first reaches completion.  In its groundless presentness, revelation must now permanently touch the ground."&lt;ref&gt;Rosenzweig, 182&lt;/ref&gt;  Revelation, epitomized by Sinai, is God's response to Israel's love.  Contrary to Paul, who argued that "through the law comes knowledge of sin",&lt;ref&gt;Romans 3: 20&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenzweig argues that it is because of and after a confession of sin that God reveals to Israel knowledge of the law.

Rosenzweig believes that for the [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbis]], Song of Songs provides a paradigm for understanding the love between God and Israel, a love that "is strong as death".&lt;ref&gt;Song of Songs 8:6; Rosenzweig, 202&lt;/ref&gt;  God's love is as strong as death because it is love for the People Israel, and it is as a collective that Israel returns God's love.  Thus, although one may die, God and Israel, and the love between them, lives on.  In other words, Song of Songs is "the focal book of revelation"&lt;ref&gt;Rosenzweig, 202&lt;/ref&gt; where the "grammar of love" is most clearly expressed. But this love that is as strong as death ultimately transcends itself, as it takes the form of God's law — for it is the law that binds Israel as a people, and through observance of the law that each Jew relives the moment of revelation at Mt. Sinai.  Ultimately, Song of Songs points back to Leviticus's command to love one's neighbor as oneself and to the rest of the Torah.

Through the revelation of God's commandments, in Rosenzweig's view, the love portrayed in Song of Songs becomes the love commanded in Leviticus.  Just as love for the Children of Israel is one of the ways that God is present in the world, the necessary response by the Jews — the ''way'' to love God in return — is to extend their own love out towards their fellow human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenzweig, 203–204&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2142">'''Karl Momen''' (b. 1934) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] architect, painter and sculptor. He was born in the city of [[Mashad]], [[Iran]].

==Works==
Momen is the creator of the [[Metaphor: The Tree of Utah]], an {{convert|87|ft|m|adj=on}} sculpture resembling a tree in the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] off of [[Interstate 80 (Utah)|Interstate 80]]. Apparently, while driving along the highway to [[California]], Momen had a vision of a tree in the desert. He financed the project himself and built it from 1982 to 1986, afterwards donating the sculpture to the state of [[Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;Balaz, Christine.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=UhGmdziyTrgC&amp;pg=PA223 Backroads &amp; Byways of Utah: Drives, Day Trips &amp; Weekend Excursions]'', p. 223 (The Countryman Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Iranian-born Momen, who painted portraits of Stalin and the Shah of Iran early in his career, later studied with the surrealist painter [[Max Ernst]], and studied architecture at the Kunst Academy in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]]. It has been said that he was moved to create the {{convert|87|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} tree by the "vastness and relative emptiness" of the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]], and that the tree "brings space, nature, myth and technology together". The tree's six spheres are all coated with natural rock and minerals found within the state of Utah, and the pods below symbolize the changing of the seasons, when trees naturally transform themselves. The tree is the property of the State of Utah.&lt;ref&gt;Coolidge, Matthew and Simons, Sarah.

'''Kitty in My Pocket''' is a collection of small toy cat figurines that was first released in 1994 by [[Vivid Imaginations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evivid.co.uk/about.htm Vivid Imaginations - Company history corporate timeline: Vivid Imaginations]&lt;/ref&gt; As well the toys being sold individually in [[Blind box#Blind-boxes|blind packets]] they were also sold in blister-packaged groups and large playsets. In 2007 the line was re-released by Corinthian Marketing/MEG Toys with the same concept but with different designs for the cats. In 2009 the Kitty in My Pocket line was discontinued, yet again. In 2015, a company called Just Play re-released the line. As before they are sold in individual blind bags and in playsets.

During the late 1990s, the line - as well as the other "in My Pocket" toy lines - combined with the BBC television programme ''[[Animal Hospital]]'' and the animal charity [[RSPCA]] to create animals that came with "injuries" (a paint that turned red in cold water). Eventually the original "in My Pocket" lines disappeared and fully merged with the Animal Hospital brand name.


== Vivid Imaginations ==

The first generation of toys were initially released in individual blind packets. Later releases came in blister packs containing multiple figures. Family group figures were also released that came with a mother cat, kittens and a basket. A play set was also released that consisted of a large plastic house that folded out and contained accessories.

Two later variations on the line, "Love 'n' Sparkle" (cats that came with glittery stickers) and "Animal Hospital" (cats that had "injuries" that turned red in cold water), returned the blind packet method of distribution as well as continuing blister pack issues. Another large play set house was released with the "Animal Hospital" theme.

== Corinthian Marketing/MEG Toys ==
[[File:Kitty in My Pocket Logo.gif|thumb|right|Logo for the Corinthian Marketing/MEG Toys release]]

The second generation of toys were released in 2007. They were available in blister packs with multiple figurines and in blind boxes that came with [[jelly beans]] and three figurines. The first blister-packaged releases came in jewellery sets called Fashion Packs. These had small figurines that could clip onto pieces of jewellery included with the set.

Later releases included family sets with a mother cat and four kittens.

== Just Play ==
[[File:Kitty_in_my_Pocket_Just_Play_logo.png|thumb|right|Logo for the Just Play release]]
The third generation was released in 2015. Just Play returned the individual blind packet distribution as well as clip-on sets and a clutch handbag playset that came with four figurines.

This is a '''list of apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction''' works as portrayed in literature, film, television, and, comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brians|first=Paul|title=Nuclear holocausts : atomic war in fiction, 1895-1984|year=1987|publisher=Kent State University Press|location=Kent, Ohio|isbn=978-0-87338-335-6 |chapter=Nuclear Holocausts Bibliography}} ([http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/nuclear/a.htm Also online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227012854/http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/nuclear/a.htm |date=2011-12-27 }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Booker|first=M.

[[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|Apocalyptic fiction]] is a [[subgenre]] of [[science fiction]] that is concerned with the [[Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth|end of civilization]] due to a potentially [[existential risk|existential catastrophe]] such as [[nuclear warfare]], [[pandemic]], [[alien invasion|extraterrestrial attack]], [[impact event]], [[cybernetic revolt]], [[technological singularity]], [[dysgenics]], [[supernatural phenomena]], [[Eschatology|divine judgment]], [[climate change]], [[resource depletion]] or some other [[disaster|general disaster]]. [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|Post-apocalyptic fiction]] is set in a world or civilization after such a disaster. The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologized).
 
''[[Apocalypse]]'' is a Greek word referring to the end of the world. [[Apocalypticism]] is the religious belief that there will be an apocalypse, a term which originally referred to a revelation of God's will, but now usually refers to belief that the world will come to an end very soon, even within one's own lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Apocalypticism |title=Dictionary-Apocalypticism |accessdate=2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apocalyptic fiction does not portray catastrophes, or disasters, or near-disasters that do not result in apocalypse.  A ''threat'' of an apocalypse does not make a piece of fiction apocalyptic. For example, ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'' and ''[[Deep Impact (film)|Deep Impact]]'' are considered [[disaster film]]s and not apocalyptic fiction because, although earth and/or human-kind are terribly threatened, in the end they manage to avoid destruction. Apocalyptic fiction is not the same as fiction that provides visions of a [[dystopian]] future.  George Orwell's ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', for example, is [[dystopian fiction]], not apocalyptic fiction.

== About the director ==
Among the contemporary artists who became filmmakers, [[Ihor Podolchak]]is a figure odious. Unlike [[Matthew Barney]] and [[Marina Abramović]] he does not balance on the verge of conceptual [[video art]] but he is engaged in cinematography in its pure form&lt;ref name="АЛИК ШПИЛЮК"&gt;Шпилюк, Алик.

'''Michael Enn Sirvet''' (born 1967) is an American sculptor, designer, and structural engineer. He acquired skills and exposure to traditional sculpture techniques while studying undergraduate art history as a minor at Fordham University in the Bronx, New York, and while studying for his Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering, at the University of Maryland, College Park, by pursuing a minor in Studio Arts.

==Early career==
Sirvet  is largely self-taught. In his early career as an artist, while maintaining full-time employment as a structural engineer as a member of [[Land Sculpture Studio]] in [[Beltsville, Maryland]], he worked principally at making abstract, contemporary minimalist constructions using recycled metals and wood. His first shows at [[Washington D.C.]]'s [[Artomatic]] introduced him to the larger contemporary arts community in the metropolitan area. His bowl "Millennia" was awarded Award of Distinction for Metal by the James Renwick Alliance, a program of the [[Renwick Gallery]], [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lawson|first=Mallory|title=jra participates in ARTomatic|year=2009|series=James Renwick Alliance quarterly|issue=Summer|page=21|url=http://www.jra.org/images/Summer%2009%20Quarterly%20FINAL.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203202633/http://www.jra.org/images/Summer%2009%20Quarterly%20FINAL.pdf|archivedate=3 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mid-career==
Sirvet's mid-career started flourishing when he left full-time work in 2008 to concentrate on fine art sculpture and functional design.

Having experimented with new forms in the early 2000s, Sirvet still works by hand, but has also pioneered use of new industrial technology for his art, using skills learned in the engineering field to create solid forms out of structural aluminum, architectural plastics, and wood, which are sometimes combined in modular components. 

Sirvet has garnered several public art installations, including two commissions for the United States' [[Art in Embassies Program]] for the United States Embassy in [[Valletta]], Malta&lt;ref&gt;[https://art.state.gov/portfolio/valletta_embassy_2010/ Maltese Cross]&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States Consulate&lt;ref&gt;[https://art.state.gov/portfolio/dubai_consulate_2011/ Arabesque 1 and 2]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Dubai, United Arab Emirates]]. In the United States, public art installations include Farragut Spheres for [[District of Columbia]]'s [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]] MetroArts Art in Transit program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fynes|first=Gene|title=Metro Unveils Station Artwork|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/getthere/2010/02/metro_officials_unveil_artwork.html|accessdate=17 March 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=18 February 2010}} &lt;/ref&gt; and Red Orchard Wall for the Montgomery County Public Arts Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bressi|first1=Todd W.|last2=Cohen|first2=Dr. Michele|last3=Jenkins|first3=Suzan|title=Montgomery County Public Art Roadmap: Creating A Vibrant Public Art Ecosystem in Montgomery County|date=2016|publisher=Montgomery County Public Arts Trust Arts and Humanities Council of Montgomery County|pages=25|url=https://issuu.com/ahcmc/docs/roadmap_17-02_20|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is notable for his illustrations to [[Adam Mickiewicz|Mickiewicz]]'s ''[[Pan Tadeusz]]'', as well as a distinctive style of villas built outside Warsaw. He was probably most well known for his architecture — Świdermajer. This was a regional architectural style common in the Otwock, Poland region. These structures were wooden in construction and were popularized from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. Its creator was Michał Elwiro Andriolli. It is characterized by gazebos and decorations above the windows, some of the houses also had turrets. Pine trees were planted together with the buildings as part of the composition.

Andriolli was born on 2 November 1836 in [[Vilnius|Vilna]] (modern Vilnius), then part of the [[Russian Empire|Empire of Russia]] as a son of Francesco Andriolli to a family of an Italian emigrant, a veteran of the [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s [[Grande Armée]]. In 1855, he went to Moscow, where he started his studies at the School of Painting and Sculpture. In 1858 he graduated from the Imperial Academy of Art in Petersburg. Andriolli received a scholarship and in 1861 he went to Rome, where he continued his studies at the [[Accademia di San Luca]]. He returned to Lithuania and took part in the [[January Uprising]] against the [[Russian Empire|Imperialism of the Russian Govermant]]. Arrested by the tsarist authorities, he managed to escape from [[Kaunas Prison]] and reach London and then Paris.

An emissary of the [[Great Emigration|Committee of Polish Emigration]], he returned to Russian-held Poland, but was again arrested in 1866. Tried for his part in the Uprising, he was sentenced to [[katorga]] in [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Vyatka]]. Pardoned in 1871, Andriolli moved to Poland and settled in [[Warsaw]]. There he started his career as an illustrator for various newspapers, notably the ''[[Tygodnik Ilustrowany]]'', ''[[Kłosy]]'' and ''[[Biesiada Literacka]]''. His work for various Warsaw-based newspapers made him one of the most renown illustration makers of the time and Andriolli was hired to illustrate some of the classic works of the [[Polish literature]], notably the works by Adam Mickiewicz, [[Juliusz Słowacki]] and [[Józef Ignacy Kraszewski]]. His pictures for the first editions of Mickiewicz's ''Pan Tadeusz'' and ''[[Konrad Wallenrod]]'', prepared between 1879 and 1882, are regarded as icons of Polish literature even now.

In March 1883, Andriolli visited Paris where he was guest in home of [[Władysław Mickiewicz]] the oldest son of [[Adam Mickiewicz]]. Between 1883 and 1886, he lived in Paris, where he worked on illustrating the French language editions of works by [[William Shakespeare]] and [[James Fenimore Cooper]]. Upon his return he also prepared frescoes in several churches, notably in [[Kaunas]].

In the later years of his life, Andriolli found refuge in a small villa he designed for himself near Anielin in what is now the town of [[Otwock]] at the [[Świder]] River, close to Warsaw. Apart from his own house, he designed several other villas in the area, creating a distinctive architectural style of Warsaw's suburbs. The ''[[świdermajer]]'', as it was later dubbed by [[Konstanty Ildefons Gałczyński]], was an eclectic mixture of traditional [[Mazovia]]n village wooden architecture with Alpine and Siberian styles. It remains a distinctive feature of many of Warsaw's suburbs. Michał Andriolli died on 23 August 1893 in [[Nałęczów]] and is buried at the local cemetery.

It was founded on August 22, 1961, by the Cuban [[poet]], [[Nicolas Guillen]]. Initially their objective was uniting the intellectuals within the young [[Cuban Revolution]] to maintain a genuine Cuban culture. The group issued ''La Gaceta de Cuba'' beginning in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.uneac.org.cu/publicaciones/la-gaceta-de-cuba |accessdate=25 February 2017 |title=La Gaceta de Cuba |publisher=UNEAC |language=es }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban violinist and professor [[Evelio Tieles]] was President of the Music Section from 1977 to 1984.&lt;ref name="Evelio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecured.cu/Evelio_Tieles_Ferrer|title=Evelio Tieles Ferrer-Ecured|accessdate=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Needle time''' was created in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians' Union]] and [[Phonographic Performance Limited]] to restrict the amount of recorded music that could be transmitted by the [[BBC]] during the course of any 24-hour period.  The number of hours per week allowed gradually increased over the years from below 30 hours in the 1950s. Until 1967{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} the BBC was allowed to play only five hours per day of commercial gramophone records on the air. It continued to affect [[BBC Radio 1]], [[BBC Radio 2]] and the [[Independent Local Radio]] stations until 1988.

The result was that the BBC had to use "cover" versions of popular songs by groups such as [[Shane Fenton and the Fentones]] recorded at the BBC studios, or orchestral versions by one of the in-house orchestras, to fill in the hours.

The term "needle time" comes from the use (at the time) of gramophone records as the main source of recorded music, which were played on gramophone record players using a [[magnetic cartridge|gramophone needle]].

==Needle time notice==
Unlike American records, British records at the time carried a warning message around the edge of the record label in the centre of the record itself to the effect that: "Unauthorised public performance or broadcasting of this record is strictly prohibited."

===Radio Luxembourg===
Although the record industry in [[UK|Britain]] wanted the public to buy its records, it had to give them some airtime so that the public could find out about their existence. To that end the record industry used the commercial nighttime signals from [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] whose powerful AM signal could be heard in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. The "208" shows on Luxembourg were mainly fifteen minutes to thirty minutes in length and presented under names such as the ''[[Decca Records]] Show'' or the ''[[Capitol Records]] Show''. These prerecorded programmes resembled what later became known as [[Infomercials]], because they normally only featured a little over half of the record, with heavy plugging for title, artist and label.

Because all the hours of transmission were booked up by the major record companies (EMI, Decca, Pye, Philips etc.) groups and artists had to sign to them to get any exposure. This was one of the driving forces for [[Ronan O'Rahilly]] and others to start the first pirate radio station to get exposure for artists he represented.

===The "pirate stations"===
Unlike the [[BBC]] or Radio Luxembourg, the offshore [[pirate radio]] stations of the 1960s operated not only outside the three-mile limit of [[territorial waters]], but also in a grey area of the law. Because the studios and transmitters were located on board the ships or offshore structures, the personnel on board were only under the authority of the captain of that ship or structure. In the case of ship stations such as [[Wonderful Radio London]] which introduced [[top 40]] radio to Britain, the ship was actually registered in a foreign country and therefore subject to the laws of that country, which of course did not recognize "needle time". [[Payola]] operated on several of these stations.

'''''Notre-Dame, une fin d'après-midi''''' ("A Glimpse of Notre-Dame in the Late Afternoon") is a painting by [[Henri Matisse]] from 1902. Its somber coloration is typical of Matisse's works executed between the end of 1901 and the end of 1903, a period of personal difficulties for the artist. This episode has been called Matisse's Dark Period.&lt;ref name="Spurling33"&gt;Spurling, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is an oil painting on paper mounted on canvas and it measures 72.5 × 54.5&amp;nbsp;cm (28½ × 21½ in). It is in the [[Albright–Knox Art Gallery]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

==Background==
Between 1896 and 1901, Matisse's painting had progressed from the subdued tones of his earliest works to an intense colorism that prefigured the [[Fauvism]] to come. In 1896 and 1897 he had traveled to [[Brittany]], where the Australian painter [[John Peter Russell]] encouraged him to paint ''[[en plein air]]''. Through Russell he met [[Camille Pissarro]], whose influence was decisive in making a colorist of Matisse.&lt;ref&gt;UCLA Art Council 1966, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898 he traveled to [[London]], where he studied the works of [[J. M. W. Turner]]; then, after a year spent in [[Corsica]] and [[Toulouse]], he returned to Paris, where the startling boldness of his work was admired by  other young artists.&lt;ref name="UCLA10"&gt;UCLA Art Council 1966, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; His paintings found few buyers, however, and his wife, Amélie, had to open a dress shop to support their household.&lt;ref name="UCLA10"/&gt; 

In May 1902 a major financial scandal, the [[Thérèse Humbert|Humbert Affair]], unexpectedly ensnared Amélie's family. Her mother ( who was the Humbert family's housekeeper)  and father became scapegoats in the scandal; as a result, Matisse was forced to spend much of his time during the next year dealing with lawyers and journalists.&lt;ref name="Spurling33" /&gt; His studio was searched by detectives, and his wife's family was menaced by angry mobs of fraud victims.&lt;ref name="Spurling33" /&gt; According to art historian [[Hilary Spurling]], "their public exposure, followed by the arrest of his father-in-law, left Matisse as the sole breadwinner for an extended family of seven. This is why he switched to painting canvases that were at least potentially saleable".&lt;ref name="Spurling33" /&gt;

Inspired by [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] and [[Antoine-Louis Barye|Barye]], Matisse struggled to master volume in sculpture as well as in painting. He darkened his palette, with the results seen in the present work, and in such paintings as ''Carmelina'' (1903, in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]).&lt;ref name="UCLA10" /&gt;

'''Perceptual art''' is a form of [[art]] that can trace its roots to the art history concepts of perceptualism as well as to twentieth century inventions of [[conceptual art]] and [[performance art]].

==Perceptualism==
The concept of perceptualism has been discussed in historical and philosophical explorations of art and [[psychology]], thus it forms an innate relationship between the [[artist]] and [[philosopher]].  Norman Bryson discussed perceptualism in terms of optical truth, as opposed to [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]] interpretations that take into account the social values of any given era's zeitgeist.  [[Ernst Gombrich]] discussed perceptualism in terms of universal perceptual and psychological responses that govern the reception of images across time and differences in culture. [[Jack Chambers (artist)|Jack Chambers]] discussed perceptualism, which he first called "Perceptual Realism," in terms of [[visual art]] that is a "profound reflection of primary [[sense data|sensory experience]], not simply a reproduction of it."&lt;ref&gt;Cheetham, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
In practice, perceptual art may be interpreted as the engagement of multi-sensory experiential stimuli combined with the multiplicity of interpretive meanings on the part of an observer.  Sometimes, the role of observer is obscured as members of the public may unwittingly or unknowingly be participants in the creation of the artwork itself.

==Examples==
In the late 20th century, visual artists such as [[Robert Smithson]], with his massive land-based creation entitled Spiral Jetty, began to break down barriers between art medium and subjective interpretation.  [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]]'s wrapping of the Reichstag was another milestone in this succession. [[Jack Chambers (artist)|Jack Chambers]] used "sense combinations [to] complement one another to enrich perception"&lt;ref&gt;Chambers quoted in Cheetham, 17&lt;/ref&gt; in paintings such as ''401 Towards London No. 1''. [[Andy Kaufman]] utilized television as his primary medium in the 1980s, creating intentionally unusual and sometimes confrontational situations that left viewers unsure of their nature and meaning (Sometimes Kaufman's intentions were even undisclosed to fellow performers).  A new generation of artists have continued stretching definitions and boundaries between performance, intent and meaning, such as [[Karen Finley]], whose controversial performances were criticized by a U.S. senator, [[Joey Skaggs]], who creates artificial news stories that are often reprinted by major media outlets, and [[Paul Rebhan]] who charges a fee for his friendship, smuggles his own paintings into museums, and hosts dating events where no one is allowed to speak.

'''Post turtle''' is a phrase that has been used in political discussion of various countries, including the U.S. and Canada, based on an old joke. Various politicians have been referenced by the joke or used the joke, including [[Bill Clinton]],&lt;ref name="PostTurtle02"/&gt; [[George W Bush]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politicalhumor.about.com/library/jokes/bljokebushpostturtle.htm |title=Political Jokes – Bush the Post Turtle |publisher=About.com |accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barack Obama]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dorinson |first=Patrick |url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2009/08/28/patrick-dorinson-obama-post-turtle/ |title=The Cowboy Libertarian: Obama the 'Post Turtle' |publisher=Fox News – Opinion |date=August 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Donald Trump]]. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/9kkxov/while_stitching_a_cut_on_the_hand_of_a_75_year/?st=JMRH2S1L&amp;sh=252e7e77|title=Donald Trump - The Post Trutle|date=October 2, 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==The joke==
An old rancher is talking about politics with a young man from the city. He compares a politician to a "post turtle". The young man doesn't understand and asks him what a post turtle is.

The old man says, "When you're driving down a country road and you see a fence post with a turtle balanced on top, that's a post turtle. You know he didn't get up there by himself. He doesn't belong there; you wonder who put him there; he can't get anything done while he's up there; and you just want to help the poor, dumb thing down."

==Notable usage==
[[Mary Doria Russell]] used the post turtle reference in her 1996 novel ''[[The Sparrow (novel)|The Sparrow]]'', attributing it to Father D.W. Yarborough, leader of the first Earth expedition to another planet. Yarborough refers to post turtles in the context of seeming anomalies in nature and regards them as proof of the existence of God, specifically of God trying to get our attention.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Mary Doria (1996). ''The Sparrow''. Villard.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton'' by [[Joe Klein]], published in 2002, quotes Clinton as saying: "If you see a turtle sitting on top of a fence post, it didn't get there by accident." According to Klein, this was Clinton's way of claiming partial responsibility for "the historic prosperity and the global peace that attended his time in office".&lt;ref name="PostTurtle02"&gt;{{cite news |author=Kennedy, William |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 24, 2002 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E4D91039F937A15750C0A9649C8B63 |title=The Turtle on the Fence Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Molly Ivins]] is attributed to usage for George W. Bush.&lt;ref name="PostTurtle01"&gt;{{cite web |author=Ivins, Molly |publisher=Democrats.US |year=2003 |url=http://www.democrats.us/editorial/ivins042304.shtml |title=Turtle on a Fence Post |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040707111634/http://democrats.us/editorial/ivins042304.shtml |archivedate=July 7, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Steve Benen]], lead blogger for the liberal "The Political Animal" at ''[[Washington Monthly]]'', referred to [[Eric Cantor]] as a post turtle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Benen |first=Steve |url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009_12/021344.php |title=Eric Cantor, Post Turtle |publisher=Political Animal (Washington Monthly) |date=October 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2010 [[Country Music Association Awards|CMAs]], [[Brad Paisley]] used the phrase in his acceptance speech for Entertainer of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/metro-music/2010-11-11/lady-antebellum-wins-2-cma-awards |title=Lady Antebellum wins 2 CMA awards |work=The Augusta Chronicle |date=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ground Zero Spirit.jpg|thumb|''Raising the Flag at Ground Zero'']]
'''''Raising the Flag at Ground Zero''''' is a photograph by [[Thomas E. Franklin]] of [[The Record (Bergen County)|''The Record'' (Bergen County, N.J.)]], taken on September 11, 2001. The picture shows three [[New York City Fire Department|New York City firefighter]]s raising the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] at Ground Zero of the [[World Trade Center site|World Trade Center]], following the [[September 11 attacks]]. The official names for the photograph used by ''The Record'' are '''''Firefighters Raising Flag''''' and '''''Firemen Raising the Flag at Ground Zero'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2012 |url=http://northjersey.mycapture.com/mycapture/category.asp?eventID=1289511&amp;CategoryID=69063 |title=9/11 Photo Gallery |work=NorthJerseyimages |publisher=[[North Jersey Media Group]] |accessdate=July 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The photo appeared on ''The Record'' front page on September 12, 2001. The paper also put it on the [[Associated Press]] wire and it appeared on the covers of several newspapers around the world. It has often been compared to the ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]'' photograph taken by [[Joe Rosenthal]] during [[World War II]].{{citation needed|date = April 2018}}

==Photograph==
{{unreferenced-section|date=April 2015}}
Franklin shot the photograph shortly after 5 p.m. with a [[telephoto lens]].  At this time, he was standing under a pedestrian walkway across the [[West Side Highway]] that connected the center to the [[Brookfield Place (New York City)|World Financial Center]], located at the northwest corner of the [[World Trade Center site]].  Franklin said the firefighters were about {{convert|150|yards}} away from him and the debris was {{convert|100|yards}} beyond that.  They were about {{convert|20|ft}} off the ground.

Franklin had hitched a ride on a [[tug boat]] across the [[Hudson River]], arriving around noon after the towers had collapsed.  He was with photographer [[James Nachtwey]] when he saw the firefighters.

The firefighters pictured were Brooklyn-based firefighters George Johnson of [[Rockaway Beach, Queens|Rockaway Beach]], Dan McWilliams of [[Long Island]] (both from Ladder 157), and Billy Eisengrein of [[Staten Island]] (Rescue 2).

==Flag==
The flag came from the yacht ''Star of America'', owned by Shirley Dreifus and her late husband Spiros E. Kopelakis, which was docked in the yacht basin in the Hudson River at the World Financial Center. McWilliams cut the [[Yard_(sailing)|yardarm]] off of the yacht with a [[K-Saw]] and then took the flag and its pole from the yacht to an evacuation area on the northwest side of the site.  They found a pole about {{convert|20|ft}} off the ground.

Soon after its raising above Ground Zero, the flag disappeared. The city thought it had possession of the flag after the attack, Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]] and [[George Pataki]] signed it, and it flew at the [[New York City Hall]], [[Yankee Stadium]], and on the {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71}} during its service in the Mideast. When the flag's owner prepared to formally donate the flag, it was discovered that it was ''not'' the flag from Ground Zero. There was a size discrepancy, the yacht's flag measured {{convert|4|x|6|ft|m}}, the flag the city had measured {{convert|5|x|8|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Stars &amp; Stripes Forever |first= Richard H. |last= Schneider |year= 2003 |isbn= 0-06-052537-1 |pages= 160–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreifus started a website in an effort to get the flag back.&lt;ref name="WTCflag"&gt;{{cite web |year=2007 |url=http://www.famouspictures.org/raising-the-flag-at-the-wtc/|work=Famous Pictures Magazine |title= Raising the Flag at the WTC |accessdate=July 16, 2013 |last=Lucas |first= Dean}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 [[CNN]] documentary film, ''The Flag'', directed by filmmakers [[Michael Tucker (director)|Michael Tucker]] and Petra Epperlein investigated the mystery of this missing 9/11 icon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=August 22, 2013 |url=http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2013/08/22/the-flag-pursues-the-mystery-of-a-missing-911-icon/|title= ''The Flag'' Pursues the Mystery of a Missing 9/11 Icon |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=August 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and discovered video evidence that the flag went missing hours after it was first raised. The original flag has now been recovered. The recovery came as a result of a lead gathered following the airing of the History Channel's ''Brad Meltzer's Lost History'' in 2014. A number of scientists have now verified that the flag is authentic, and it was unveiled on Sunday, September 11, 2016, the 15th anniversary of 9/11, on a History Channel special on the flag, ''America's 9/11 Flag: Rise From the Ashes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=September 6, 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/07/nyregion/long-lost-9-11-flag-an-enduring-mystery-will-go-on-view-at-museum.html|title=Long-Lost 9/11 Flag, an Enduring Mystery, Will Go on View at Museum |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=September 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Potter]]; Firefighters Billy Eisengrein and George Johnson; [[George W. Bush]]; U.S. Rep. [[Gary Ackerman]], 5th District, N.Y. (who sponsored the stamp); Firefighter Dan McWilliams; and Record photographer [[Thomas E. Franklin]], who took the photo featured on the stamp]]
Michael Kessel, a Manhattan attorney, suggested to U.S. Representative [[Gary Ackerman]] that the photo be used for a stamp, and the "Heroes 2001" stamp, USA [[Scott catalogue|Scott]] #B2, was unveiled on March 11, 2002, by President [[George W. Bush]], in a ceremony attended by Franklin, Johnson, Eisengrein, and McWilliams. These stamps were [[semipostal]]s: they had a purchase price (45¢) higher than their postage value (34¢), with the balance given to the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]'s relief efforts. A special exception was thus made to the normal requirement by the [[United States Postal Service]] that subjects of stamps be deceased. 

In December 2001, the New York City Fire Department unveiled plans for a statue based on the photograph to be placed at the Brooklyn headquarters.  In an effort to be inclusive of all those who had been affected by the tragedy, the statue was to include black, white, and Hispanic firefighters. The change in ethnicity from the actual firefighters, all of whom are white, proved controversial enough that the statue was never built.

On November 5, 2007, a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} bronze monument based on the photograph called ''To Lift A Nation'' and depicting three New York firefighters raising the flag over the ruins of the World Trade Center was dedicated at the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Park in Emmitsburg, Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first= Rusty |last= Shackleford |date= November 6, 2007 |title= 9/11 Firefighters Monument Dedicated |url= http://mypetjawa.mu.nu/archives/190028.php |work= The Jawa Report |access-date= September 11, 2016}}{{verify credibility|date= September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==From another angle==
The picture taken by Thomas E. Franklin is not to be confused with another picture of the same event but from a different angle by Ricky Flores for ''[[The Journal News]]''. Flores also was able to get near Ground Zero on the day of the attacks and at around the same time that Franklin took his shot, Flores was able to get into a second story of a nearby building and capture the same picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyppa.org/flores-911/|title=Ricky Flores - 9/11|author=|date=|website=New York Press Photographers Association, Inc.|accessdate=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WTCflag" /&gt;

The '''''Reader's Digest Condensed Books''''' were a series of hardcover [[anthology]] collections, published by the American general interest monthly family magazine ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' and distributed by [[direct mail]].  Most volumes contained five (although a considerable minority consisted of three, four, or six) current best-selling novels and nonfiction books which were [[abridged]] (or "condensed") specifically for ''Reader's Digest''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02680426 Springer.com: "The continuous publication of the Reader's Digest Condensed Books directmail
subscription series since 1950 is a cultural phenomenon."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/65843-reader-s-digest-condensed-book-series-to-get-wider-distribution.html Publishers Weekly: "Reader's Digest Condensed Book Series to Get Wider Distribution" March 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was popular; a 1987 New York Times article estimated annual sales of 10 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/02/nyregion/new-editor-at-digest-s-condensed-books.html N.Y. Times: "New Editor at Digest's Condensed Books" August 2, 1987]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this popularity, old copies are notoriously difficult to sell. &lt;ref&gt;[https://nathanhobby.com/2012/03/11/readers-digest-condensed-books-as-difficult-to-dispose-of-as-bins-of-radioactive-waste/ "Readers Digest Condensed Books as diffiult to dispose of as bins of radioactive waste"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claytonlibrary.org/donating.htm Clayton Library: "We Don't Accept Reader's Digest Condensed Books--they do not sell."]&lt;/ref&gt;

For most of their publication schedule, the volumes were issued four times each year, with the rate gradually increasing to a bi-monthly schedule by the early-1990s. The series was produced for 47 years (1950–1997), until being renamed ''[[Reader's Digest Select Editions]]''. (''Note'': UK editions seem to have been somewhat different from USA editions. Pre-1992 Canadian editions also contain different titles).

Occasional titles  such as ''[[The Leopard]]'' (Summer 1960), ''[[The Days Were Too Short]]'' (Autumn 1960), and ''[[Papillon (book)|Papillon]]'' (Autumn 1970) were not written in English but published as abridgments of the translated versions. In a few cases, new editions of older works (''[[Up from Slavery]]'', originally published in 1901 (Autumn 1960), ''[[A Roving Commission: My Early Life]]'', originally published in 1930 (Autumn 1951) or ''[[Goodbye Mr. Chips]]'', originally published in 1934 (Summer 1961)) were also among the condensed selections.

'''Standard Model''' is the title of an [[exhibition]] held between 1 October and 25 October 2009 at the Nordin Gallery, Stockholm. The exhibition was made in collaboration between Swedish artist Karl Tuikkanen and London based Australian artist David Brazier and represents the first physical manifestation of their artistic partnership exploring ideas of [[communication]] and [[collaboration]] mediated through the [[internet]].

[[File:Standard model.jpg|thumb|500px|Standard Model Installation View, Nordin Gallery, Stockholm, 2009]]

==Process==
Central to the artists’ process has been mining the public information resource [[Wikipedia]], allowing for the logic of the network to develop the content of the exhibition. Beginning with the Wikipedia page for ‘standard model’ the artists used the system of selecting and sending Wikipedia links between Stockholm and London to quickly take them to destinations far removed from their points of departure.

Reminiscent of [[surrealist]] strategies of “[[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]” and “[[Exquisite Corpse]]” Tuikkanen and Brazier relinquish authorial control, choosing instead to hand it over to the web based dialogue and the content of internet links. In doing so, coherence and rationality is discarded for a logic which follows loose associations, without hierarchy or proof of authenticity.

==Links==
Each artist began with the Wikipedia page for ‘[[standard model]]’. From there the artist would select a link and send it to the other artist who would repeat the process until the final information page was six times removed from the original Wikipedia page for ‘standard model’. The information that emerged through this process provided the content for works made and exhibited. This process was repeated 12 times.

The '''Symbolist movement''' in [[Romania]], active during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, marked the development of [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]] in both [[Literature of Romania|literature]] and [[Art of Romania|visual arts]]. Bringing the assimilation of [[France]]'s [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Decadent movement|Decadence]] and [[Parnassianism]], it promoted a distinctly urban culture, characterized by [[cosmopolitanism]], [[Francophilia]] and endorsement of [[Westernization]], and was generally opposed to either rural themes or [[Patriotism|patriotic]] displays in art. Like its [[Western Europe]]an counterparts, the movement stood for [[idealism]], [[Sentimentalism (literature)|sentimentalism]] or [[exoticism]], alongside a noted interest in [[spirituality]] and [[esotericism]], covering on its own the ground between local [[Romanticism]] and the emerging [[modernism]] of the ''[[fin de siècle]]''. Despite such unifying traits, Romanian Symbolism was an [[Eclecticism|eclectic]], factionalized and often self-contradictory current.

Originally presided upon by poet and novelist [[Alexandru Macedonski]], founder of ''[[Literatorul]]'' magazine, the movement sparked much controversy with its stated disregard for established convention. The original circle of Symbolists made adversaries among the [[Conservatism|conservative]] ''[[Junimea]]'' club, as well as among the traditionalist writers affiliated with ''[[Sămănătorul]]'' review and the [[left-wing]] [[Poporanism|Poporanists]]. However, Romanian Symbolism also radiated within these venues: sympathetic to ''Junimea''{{'}}s [[art for art's sake]] principles, it also communicated to [[Neo-romanticism|neoromantic]] sensibilities within the traditionalist clubs, and comprised a [[Socialism|socialist]] wing of its own. In parallel, the notoriety of Macedonski's circle contributed to the development of other influential Symbolist and post-Symbolist venues, including [[Ovid Densusianu]]'s ''[[Vieața Nouă]]'' and [[Ion Minulescu]]'s ''[[Revista Celor L'alți]]'', as well as to the birth of artists' clubs such as ''[[Tinerimea Artistică]]''. The latter category of Symbolist venues helped introduce and promote the aesthetics of [[Art Nouveau]], [[Vienna Secession]], [[post-Impressionism]] and related schools.

Before and during [[World War I]], with the birth of magazines such as ''[[Simbolul]]'' and ''[[Chemarea]]'', the modernist current within Symbolism mutated into the [[avant-garde]] trend, while the more conservative Symbolist circles made a return to [[Neoclassicism]]. Other manifestations of Symbolism, prolonged by the ideology of [[Eugen Lovinescu]]'s ''[[Sburătorul]]'' review, continued to play a part in Romanian cultural life throughout the [[interwar period]].

==Early Symbolism==

===Origins===
[[File:Le Vaisseau fantôme Macedonski L'Élan littéraire.PNG|thumb|260px|One of [[Alexandru Macedonski]]'s poems, in ''[[L'Élan Littéraire]]'' (1885)]]
The ground for Parnassianism and Symbolism in Romania was prepared by the Romania public's introduction to the poetry and essays of [[Charles Baudelaire]]. One participant in this process was the French author [[Ange Pechméja]], exiled for his opposition to the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], who settled in [[Bucharest]] and published what is purportedly the first article on Baudelaire to have been circulated in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Eiland, Michael W. Jennings, notes to [[Walter Benjamin]], "Central Park", in ''The Complete Works of Walter Benjamin, Volume 4: 1938-1940'', [[Harvard University Press]], Cambridge, 2003, p.197.  {{ISBN|0-674-01076-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest echoes from within the country were found among the ''Junimists'': as early as the 1870s, the club's magazine ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' published several works by Baudelaire, translated from [[French language|French]] by [[Vasile Pogor]].&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.8"&gt;Cernat, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these texts had echoes in ''Junimist'' literature. Active later in the decade, poet [[Mihai Eminescu]] probably accommodated some Symbolist themes into his own Romantic and [[Pessimism|pessimistic]] [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] works, most notably in his 1872 novel ''[[Poor Dionis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Marian, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Junimea'' poet [[Veronica Micle]] (Eminescu's lover) may also have assimilated the nostalgia typical of French Symbolists.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Elena Vulcănescu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/VULCANESCUaug9.html "Valeria Micle Sturdza"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Another point of contact stood at the core of ''Junimist'' theory, where the group's doyen, [[Titu Maiorescu]], had placed the concept of "art for art's sake", stating his opposition to the [[didacticism]] endorsed by his various rivals while aligning himself with [[Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics|Schopenhauerian aesthetics]] and other constructs of [[German philosophy]]. This approach also showed Maiorescu's appreciation for the artistic principles of [[United States|American]] poet [[Edgar Allan Poe]], who was a direct influence on the French Symbolists or Parnassians—the ''Junimist'' philosopher had in fact read Poe's theoretical essays, "[[The Poetic Principle]]" and "[[The Philosophy of Composition]]", in a French-language translation signed by Baudelaire.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, p.75-76; Ornea, p.52, 54&lt;/ref&gt; However, Maiorescu generally ignored and at times expressed a strong rejection of French-inspired modern literary schools, either Parnassian or Symbolist.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.412-413, 437, 685. See also: Ornea, p.53, 117, 301-304; Vianu, Vol. II, p.45-46, 243&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite such contacts, the earliest form of native Symbolism emerged from the mainstream, non-''Junimist'', Romantic tradition. Literary historian [[Paul Cernat]] argues that the Symbolist movement's later evolution reflected an original clash of ideas, between the "[[Metaphysics|metaphysical]], conservative and [[Germanophile]]" nature of ''Junimism'' and the "revolutionary, cosmopolitan, [[Progressivism|progressivist]] and Francophile" position of Romanian Romanticism.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; A product of the Romantic school in Romania's southern area of [[Wallachia]], [[Alexandru Macedonski]] provoked scandal by openly challenging the dominance of ''Junimist'' figures. One such ill-famed campaign focused on Eminescu, who was coming to be recognized as Romania's [[national poet]], and who stood for political conservatism, [[Folklore of Romania|folkloric]] traditionalism, [[ethnic nationalism]] and the direct influence of [[German Romanticism]].&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Mihai Zamfir]], [http://www.romlit.ro/rivalul_lui_eminescu "Rivalul lui Eminescu"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 27/2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.230, 242, 407, 412, 520-521, 683; Cernat, p.10-11; Vianu, Vol. II, p.243, 351-360, 379, 387; Vol. III, p.353-356&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to these incidents, critic [[Mihai Zamfir]] noted: "Actually, with the incompatibility between Maiorescu and Macedonski, between ''Junimea'' and the Macedonskian club, a border is traced [...] separating the 19th century from the 20th."&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt; While Eminescu's approach still evolved within the limits set by ''Junimea'', it served to inspire a large number of non-''Junimist'' traditionalists, whose didacticism, shaped by [[Populism|populist]] values, was hotly opposed by Macedonski and his followers.&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.556-559, 643, 683; Cernat, p.14-15; Sandqvist, p.60-62, 197, 200, 202, 281. See also: Braga, p.16; Șotropa (2009), p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

Such conflicts were aired by means of Macedonski's Bucharest-based ''[[Literatorul]]'' review. Initially a purely anti-''Junimist'' platform hosting contributions from aging Romantic writers ([[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]], [[Bonifaciu Florescu]], [[V. A. Urechia]] etc.), it closed down several times and eventually reemerged as the main platform of early Romanian Symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.515-543; Vianu, Vol. II, p.243, 351-393, 387-389, 398, 418-419, 420, 472-473, 483; Vol. III, p.355-356, 384-386. See also: Ornea, p.137, 233, 301-304, 308-309; Suciu, p.103-104&lt;/ref&gt; The circle had among its representatives a number of Macedonski's young disciples and colleagues, themselves more or less influenced by the aesthetics of Decadence and Symbolism: [[Th. M. Stoenescu]], [[Dumitru Constantinescu-Teleormăneanu]], [[Caton Theodorian]], [[Carol Scrob]], [[Dumitru Karnabatt]], [[Mircea Demetriade]], [[Donar Munteanu]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.523, 531-532, 594-597, 701-702, 719; Vianu, Vol. II, p.351, 359-360, 373-374, 391&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonski's own participation in Symbolism had an international character. It dates back to the mid-1880s, when his French-language poems were first published in French or [[Belgium|Belgian]] Symbolist periodicals (''[[La Wallonie]]'' and ''[[L'Élan Littéraire]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.11-12; Sandqvist, p.197; Suciu, p.104, 109; Vianu, Vol. II, p.362; M. Vida (2007), p.55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dgactiv"&gt;{{ro icon}} Dan Gulea, [http://www.revista-apostrof.ro/articole.php?id=410 "Activ, retroactiv"], in ''[[Apostrof]]'', Nr. 8/2007&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent decades, the Romanian writer made repeated efforts to consolidate his reputation as a European Symbolist and enhance the profile of his ''Literatorul'' group, publishing his [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] novel ''[[Thalassa, Le Calvaire de feu]]'' in [[Paris]] and establishing personal contacts with French and [[Francophone]] authors.&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.190-191, 245; Cernat, p.11-12, 42, 88-89, 184, 402; Sandqvist, p.199-200, 240; Suciu, p.106-107; Vianu, Vol. II, p.369-371, 376-379, 381, 420, 436-448, 467-472; Vol. III, p.352-353&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism between Macedonski and Petică===
[[File:Constantin Jiquidi - Un poet simbolist.JPG|thumb|260px|"The Symbolist poet", as portrayed by cartoonist [[Constantin Jiquidi]]. At the bottom, a stack of papers with the title ''[[Literatorul]]'']]
Analyzing the overall eclectic nature of the movement originating with ''Literatorul'', Mihai Zamfir concluded: "on Romanian territory, all currents united themselves into a synthetic 'newism' ".&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.12"&gt;Cernat, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, literary historian [[Mircea Braga]] argued that Romanian Symbolism was more a state of mind than a program, its theses being "numerous and often imprecise".&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; In line with these developments, the Symbolist milieus had as a shared focus their admiration for the [[French Third Republic|Third French Republic]], and for Paris as ''la Cité des Lumières'' ("the City of Lights").&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.16, 17, 59. See also: Boia, p.61, 102-103, 190-191, 235, 245-246; Sandqvist, p.119, 120, 197-200, 203, 240, 302; Șotropa (2009), p.38-39; Suciu, p.102, 103-110&lt;/ref&gt;

As another unifying element in their post-Romantic opposition to the traditionalists and their advocacy of national specificity, the emerging Symbolists generally valued cosmopolitan [[individualism]] and cultivated [[exoticism]]. In this context, [[Dimitrie Anghel]] attracted critical praise with elaborate fantasy prose and floral-themed [[lyric poetry]], rich in Decadentist and eccentric imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.302, 563, 603, 652, 683, 687-691, 750-751, 832, 835, 845, 858, 864, 960; Cernat, p.11, 18-19, 73, 351&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the fold of regular Symbolism, but directly inspired by [[François Coppée]], [[Haralamb Lecca]] delved into macabre subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.592&lt;/ref&gt; More frequently, the choice of exotic subjects was modeled on Macedonski's poems, and fed by echoes of the [[Major explorations after the Age of Discovery|major explorations]], which were becoming familiar news in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Mircea Anghelescu]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Calatoriile-intre-literatura-si-viata-reala*articleID_15039-articles_details.html "Călătoriile, între literatură și viața reală"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 312, March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ispinzele"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ioan Stanomir]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Toate-pinzele-sus*articleID_372-articles_details.html "Toate pînzele sus!"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 100, January 2002&lt;/ref&gt; This fashion was notably illustrated by [[Iuliu Cezar Săvescu]], who sang the deserts and the [[polar region]]s.&lt;ref name="ispinzele"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.686&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, Karnabatt and his wife [[Lucrezzia Karnabatt|Lucrezzia]] took Symbolism to the realm of [[travel writing]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Angelo Mitchievici]], "Dimitrie et Lucrezzia Karnabatt: voyages symbolistes", in ''Revue Roumaine d'Histoire de l'Art. Série Beaux-arts'', 2007, p.95-102&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[Bovarysme|Bovaryist]]" and "[[snob]]bish" tendency, Cernat notes, was what made many members of the movement seek to acquire for themselves an urban identity which clashed with the rural ideal and the religious mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.15-19&lt;/ref&gt; One other defining trait, which endured as a distinct tradition within Romanian Symbolism, was Macedonski's interest in alternatives to established religion, primarily manifested by his [[Esotericism|esoteric]] studies, and taken up by his disciples Karnabatt, [[Alexandru Petroff]],&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.11, 17. See also Vianu, Vol. II, p.372-373, 386, 389, 430&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alexandru Obedenaru]].&lt;ref name="sfmasa"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Șerban Foarță]], [http://www.romlit.ro/masa_intelectualilor "La masa intelectualilor"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 38/2003&lt;/ref&gt; In later manifestations of Symbolism and Decadentism, this interest merged itself with a stated or implicit preference of other affiliates for [[Roman Catholicism in Romania|Roman Catholicism]] in front of the majority religion, [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodoxy]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.17, 42&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these ideas were also inspiring the Romanian-born aristocrat [[Charles-Adolphe Cantacuzène]], who was debuting as a poet in France, and who borrowed his mystical subjects from the Symbolist doyen [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].&lt;ref&gt;Houssais, p.33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

The identification with France came together with respect for the declining local aristocracy, the [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyars]], whom some of the Romanian Symbolists preferred over both the peasant majority and the competitive [[Capitalism|capitalist]] environment.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.683; Cernat, p.16, 18, 19-21&lt;/ref&gt; It became a component of a larger Symbolist [[counterculture]]: several members of the movement, Macedonski included, found inspirational value in [[social alienation]] and individual failure, driving some of them to sympathize with the [[proletariat]] and the urban [[underclass]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.515-516, 523-524, 561-563, 652, 685, 697, 702, 706; Cernat, p.18, 51; Vianu, Vol. II, p.389-391, 398-406, 421-422, 480. See also: Ștefănescu, p.308; Suciu, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; However, the group as a whole was still nominally opposed to the [[Socialism|socialist]] circles of literary theorist [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]] and his ''[[Contemporanul]]'' review, who primarily advocated a [[working class]] and [[Literary realism|realistic]] version of didacticism.&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.545-565, 602, 685; Cernat, p.20; Ornea, p.308-358. See also Sandqvist, p.348&lt;/ref&gt; This gap between was traversed by Macedonski's younger friend, the socialist poet and novelist [[Traian Demetrescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.561-563, 685, 697, 719, 726-727. See also: Ornea, p.357-358; Vianu, Vol. II, p.361-362, 377-378, 389, 391, 409, 421; Vol. III, p.285-286&lt;/ref&gt;

Macedonski's ideology was itself marked by inconsistency and eclecticism, often allowing for the coexistence of Parnassian and Symbolist opposites, and eventually turning into [[Neoclassicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.523-529; Cernat, p.11-12, 16; Suciu, p.103&lt;/ref&gt; Also attracted into this Neoclassical mix was the poetic work of occasional contributors to Symbolist reviews: [[Panait Cerna]], [[Mihai Codreanu]], [[Oreste Georgescu]], [[Cincinat Pavelescu]], [[Duiliu Zamfirescu]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.534-536, 648-653. See also: Ornea, p.263, 303; Vianu, Vol. II, p.366-367, 369, 377, 387, 390-391, 418-419, 463, 465-467; Vianu, Vol. III, p.353-354, 386-387&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest internal restructuring of Romanian Symbolism occurred in 1895, a moment of effervescence in literary history. At the time, ''Literatorul'' was facing financial difficulties, its role being supplanted by a large number of magazines (''[[Revista Contimporană]]'', ''Revista Literară'', ''Revista Olteană'', ''Revista Orientală'', ''Révue Franco-Roumaine'' etc.), most of them  gravitating around Macedonski's circle.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.15, 40&lt;/ref&gt; ''Liga Ortodoxă'', a new magazine launched by Macedonski during the interval, published the first-ever contributions by young poet [[Tudor Arghezi]], later one of the most acclaimed figures in Romanian letters.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.808; Cernat, p.8, 15, 29; Vianu, Vol. II, p.369; Vol. III, p.475-476&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent figure among Macedonski's disciples to establish himself shortly after 1900 was poet and critic [[Ștefan Petică]], originally a socialist influenced by Dobrogeanu-Gherea.&lt;ref name="mzpetica"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Mihai Zamfir]], [http://www.romlit.ro/tefan_petic__suavul_vistor "Ștefan Petică – suavul visător"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 42/2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.685&lt;/ref&gt; Also noted for his attempts to set up contacts abroad, Petică was especially known for his overall erudition and his familiarity with [[English literature]], with which came a stream of [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] and [[Aestheticism|Aestheticist]] influences into Romanian Symbolist poetry and prose.&lt;ref name="mzpetica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cǎlinescu, p.685-686; Cernat, p.12, 15, 16; Șotropa (2009), p.39-40&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the programmatic articles published by him in 1899 and 1900 do not clarify his exact relationship with Symbolism, his 1902 volume ''Fecioara în alb'' ("The Virgin in White") was described by researchers as the first product of mature Symbolism in Romania,&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.15"&gt;Cernat, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; while his ''Solii păcii'' ("The Messengers of Peace") is rated as the first Symbolist work in [[Theater of Romania|Romanian drama]].&lt;ref name="mzpetica"/&gt;

The turn of the century saw the Symbolist affiliation of [[George Bacovia]], who published the first poems of what became, in 1916, the ''[[Plumb (Bacovia)|Plumb]]'' volume—inaugurating a period in his work centered on the sentimental depictions of acute alienation, sickness and suburban monotony.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.561-562, 702, 706-709, 821, 824, 844, 944; Cernat, p.15, 16, 23, 319-320; Sandqvist, p.208; Șotropa (2009), p.40; Vianu, Vol. III, p.383-391&lt;/ref&gt; The year 1904 also marked Arghezi's emancipation from Macedonski's school and the start of his search for an individual approach to Symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Balotă, p.10, 16-22, 24; Cernat, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; Directly inspired by Baudelaire, the young writer circulated the first poems in the ''Agate negre'' ("Black Agates") cycle and began editing his own periodical, ''Linia Dreaptă''.&lt;ref&gt;Balotă, p.10, 16-22; Călinescu, p.678, 683, 687, 808; Cernat, p.15, 29, 56, 304; Vianu, Vol. III, p.478-479&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Tinerimea Artistică'', Symbolism and Art Nouveau==

===Birth of ''Tinerimea Artistică''===
[[File:Nicolae Petrescu-Găină - Tinerimea Artistică, Zeflemeaua, 1903.JPG|thumb|300px|Some of the ''[[Tinerimea Artistică]]'' founders, in a caricature by [[Nicolae Petrescu-Găină]] (1903)]]
The same interval brought the first explicit manifestations of Symbolism in [[Art of Romania|local visual arts]]. The second half of the 1890s witnessed the birth of opposition to [[academic art]] under the guidance of Macedonski's associate, poet, political agitator and art patron [[Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești]], who set up an organization based on the French ''[[Société des Artistes Indépendants]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.15, 42. See also Drăguț ''et al.'', p.167&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, Bogdan-Pitești, together with [[Ioan Bacalbașa]] and [[Ștefan Ciocâlteu]], founded ''Ileana'', an international art society dedicated to the promotion of new art currents.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.42-43. See also: Drăguț ''et al.'', p.168; Juvara, p.74, 75, 76; Sandqvist, p.59; M. Vida (2007), p.55-56; Vianu, Vol. II, p.370; Vlasiu, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, ''Ileana'' financed and advertised the arrival to Bucharest of [[Joséphin Péladan]], a French Decadentist writer and [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] mystic.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.42-43, 407. See also: Șotropa (2009), p.45; Vianu, Vol. III, p.281&lt;/ref&gt; After 1900, the ''Ileana'' group began publishing an eponymous art magazine, the first one of its kind in Romania,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.43&lt;/ref&gt; but was undecided about which style Romanian art should follow.&lt;ref&gt;Drăguț ''et al.'', p.168; Juvara, p.75; Sandqvist, p.59&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1890s saw the worldwide emergence of [[Art Nouveau]] as a Symbolist art form, challenging the popularity of [[Impressionism]]. The indirect impact of [[Vienna Secession]] was major, even outside the realm of visual arts, prompting literary historian [[Ștefan Cazimir]] to suggest the existence of a Secession period in local letters during the ''[[fin de siècle]]''.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.12"/&gt; Connections with French Symbolist aesthetics were being preserved, in Paris itself, by sculptor, actor and lawyer [[Constantin Ganesco]]&lt;ref&gt;Houssais, p.29-33&lt;/ref&gt; and, with noted success, by the [[Greeks in Romania|Greek Romanian]] painter and printmaker [[Michel Simonidy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Badea-Păun, "Michel Simonidy, la tentation d'une carrière parisienne", in ''Revue Roumaine d'Histoire de l'Art. Série Beaux-arts'', 2007, p.103-118. See also Drăguț ''et al.'', p.171&lt;/ref&gt; According to the authors of the 1970 overview ''Pictura românească în imagini'' ("Illustrated Romanian Painting"), a new Art Nouveau school was born around 1900: "The predilection for Symbolist imagery, for the plant-like ornament, especially the floral one, for the decorative [[Arabesque (European art)|arabesque]], for the matte [[pastel]] in brushwork techniques, are all [...] stylistic traits characteristic for this visual aesthetics, which was not fully developed in our country, but which was symptomatic in what regards the creation [...] of a new art climate".&lt;ref&gt;Drăguț ''et al.'', p.168&lt;/ref&gt;

In Romania, the innovating aesthetics were first promoted by means of ''[[Tinerimea Artistică]]'' society. Created in 1901, it reunited artists familiarized with both France's Art Nouveau scene and the Secession phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p.59-60; Șotropa (2009), p.37-38; M. Vida (2007), ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''Ileana'', ''Tinerimea'' was still frequented by mainstream conservatives, and, art historian [[Tom Sandqvist]] argues, only radicalized itself after 1905—the year when it became home to both the post-Impressionist [[Camil Ressu]] and the Secessionist [[Dimitrie Hârlescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, art historian Mariana Vida notes, the society was stylistically undecided, but its members tended to display the same Symbolist psychology: "the Symbolist artist is a decadent, swept over by ''[[Wiktionary:morbidezza|morbidezza]]'' and [[eroticism]], persuaded by suffering, despising the [[bourgeois]] life.

===''Tinerimea'' and official art===
[[File:Ștefan Luchian - Primavara.jpg|thumb|330px|[[Ștefan Luchian]], ''Primăvara'' ("Spring")]]
The blending of Symbolism and traditional art remained a characteristic of ''Tinerimea'' art. [[Nicolae Grigorescu]], the academic Impressionist, was the respected ''Tinerimea'' forerunner, his status serving to moderate the Symbolist influence. However, according to some interpretations, Grigorescu's last works also bordered on Symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;M. Vida (2007), p.62-63&lt;/ref&gt; A major figure among the ''Tinerimea'' group was [[Ștefan Luchian]], whose canvasses and pastel drawings hesitate between Grigorescu's Impressionism, Art Nouveau and original research into new techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Drăguț ''et al.'', p.167, 168, 173-179; Juvara, p.75, 77; Pavel, p.73, 76, 83, 86-87, 97; M. Vida (2007), p.58-59&lt;/ref&gt; Luchian's colleague [[Nicolae Vermont]] was generally interested in classical forms of narrative painting, but also worked with typically Secession imagery, such as ''[[Salome]]''.&lt;ref&gt;M. Vida (2007), p.61; Teacă, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; Well liked by Dimitrie Anghel,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.688, 823&lt;/ref&gt; painter [[Kimon Loghi]] cultivated a particularly sentimental style, late Symbolist with Secession echoes.&lt;ref&gt;Juvara, p.74, 76, 77; M. Vida (2007), p.57-58; Teacă, p.69-70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pspeisajul"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Pavel Șușară]], [http://www.romlit.ro/peisajul_n_pictura_romneasc "Peisajul în pictura românească"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 22/2009&lt;/ref&gt; Loghi, who was trained by the German Symbolist master [[Franz Stuck]], enjoyed remarkable success, beginning in 1898, when he won a [[Munich Secession]] award.&lt;ref name="Juvara, p.74"&gt;Juvara, p.74&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, he represented Romanian artists at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Universal Exposition]].&lt;ref name="Juvara, p.74"/&gt;&lt;ref name="plsbrittany"&gt;Philippe Le Stum, [http://www.concarneau-peintres.fr/etranger/roumains/guide_expo_roumains.pdf ''Peintres roumains en Bretagne/Romanian Painters in Brittany (1880-1930). A Short Guide to the Summer Exhibition 2009''], [[Musée départemental Breton]], Quimper, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The somber works of [[Arthur Verona]] acclimatized Symbolism into forest landscapes and [[sacred art]],&lt;ref&gt;M. Vida (2007), p.61&lt;/ref&gt; while French Symbolist influences ([[Gustave Moreau]], [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]]) took the forefront in [[gouache]]s by the aristocrat [[Eugen N. Ghika-Budești]].&lt;ref name="msriècle"/&gt;

The aging ''Tinerimea'' mentor [[George Demetrescu Mirea]] mainly worked with academic subjects, which critics have described as grandiloquent and stale,&lt;ref&gt;Drăguț ''et al.'', p.164-166, 171&lt;/ref&gt; but allowed himself to be influenced by the French Symbolists.&lt;ref name="msriècle"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihai Sorin Rădulescu, [http://www.romlit.ro/un_pictor_fin_de_sicle "Un pictor fin de siècle"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 17/2009&lt;/ref&gt; Although he and Verona were lionized by the traditionalists for their main contributions (idyllic and Grigorescu-like),&lt;ref&gt;Drăguț ''et al.'', p.167, 170, 172&lt;/ref&gt; Mirea's pupil [[Ipolit Strâmbu]] also steered toward Symbolism in some of his portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Juvara, p.74, 76; M. Vida (2007), p.60-61&lt;/ref&gt; Initially trained in academic painting, [[Constantin Artachino]] veered toward Symbolism when seeking inspiration in the [[fairy tale]].&lt;ref name="M. Vida 2007, p.57"/&gt; Some Symbolist echoes were also identified in the canvasses of [[Gheorghe Petrașcu]] and [[Jean Alexandru Steriadi]], as well as in the engravings of [[Gabriel Popescu (graphic artist)|Gabriel Popescu]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Vida (2007), p.59, 63&lt;/ref&gt;

The echoes of Symbolism and Secession were also present in the works of ''Tinerimea'' sculptors [[Oscar Späthe]] and [[Friedrich Storck]], both of whom were also inspired by the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Munich Academy]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Juvara, p.74, 75, 77; Șotropa (2007), p.21-23; M. Vida (2007), p.61; Teacă, p.68, 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcvisuri"&gt;{{ro icon}} Marian Constantin, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Visuri-si-himere*articleID_21773-articles_details.html "Visuri și himere"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 474, May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Späthe, who earned his peers' recognition as the leading Romanian Secessionist, was inspired to create works which blended the [[Byzantine revival]] or a set of tributes to the ''[[Quattrocento]]'' into a Secession setting, his example being closely followed by Storck.&lt;ref&gt;Șotropa (2007), p.21-23&lt;/ref&gt; The echoes within Romanian sculpture were still minor, since, critics have noted, Romanian sculpture itself was underdeveloped.&lt;ref name="mcvisuri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Șotropa (2009), p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tinerimea''{{'}}s international ambitions also brought it into contact with European Symbolists, some of whom exhibited in Bucharest: [[Gustav Gurschner]], [[Henri-Jean Guillaume Martin]], [[Carl Milles]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;Juvara, p.78; M. Vida (2007), p.61-62&lt;/ref&gt; At home, Späthe's intercession&lt;ref name="mcvisuri"/&gt; gave Romanian Symbolism its official sponsor, Princess [[Marie of Edinburgh]] (the future [[List of Romanian consorts|Queen-Consort]]), an admirer of the Art Nouveau phenomenon in general. She was famously the owner of a large Art Nouveau collection at her [[Pelișor Castle]] in [[Sinaia]], where she gathered the prints of [[Alphonse Mucha]], [[Henri Privat-Livemont]] etc., as well as [[decorative art]] drawn in her own hand.&lt;ref name="asisublimul"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Adrian-Silvan Ionescu]], [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/sublimul-art-nouveau-3100497/ "Sublimul Art Nouveau"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', March 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Marie's taste, and her features, inspired the works of Romanian Symbolist sculptors into the next decade;&lt;ref&gt;Șotropa (2007), p.21, 25&lt;/ref&gt; her daughter [[Ileana of Romania]] was herself an amateur artist and writer, also won over by the Art Nouveau fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Juvara, p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1900 generation of painters and decorative artists stimulated the gradual incorporation of Art Nouveau into the vocabulary of modern [[Romanian architecture]]. In this context, the Symbolist legacy was often adapted into an allegorical expression of [[nationalism]] and [[historism]], with the Bucharest group sometimes known as ''Arta 1900'' ("Art of 1900").&lt;ref&gt;Barend, p.88-89; Sandqvist, p.58. See also Vlasiu, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; The style called ''[[Neo-Brâncovenesc]]'' (or "Neo-Romanian"), which assimilated the Art Nouveau guidelines, was announced by [[Anghel Saligny]] and later taken up by [[Ion Mincu]].&lt;ref name="vmlisabona"&gt;{{ro icon}} Virgil Mihaiu, [http://www.romlit.ro/arhitectur_art_nouveau_din_romnia_n_premier_la_lisabona "Arhitectură Art Nouveau din România în premieră la Lisabona"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 33/2009&lt;/ref&gt; The merger of decorative styles in [[handicraft]]s received enthusiastic support from ethnographer [[Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș]], and was adapted into the mural paintings of [[Abgar Baltazar]] and [[Ștefan Popescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Vlasiu, ''passim''. See also: Juvara, p.74, 76, 77; M. Vida (2007), p.59-60, 83&lt;/ref&gt;

''Neo-Brâncovenesc'' or pure Art Nouveau played an important part in remodeling the urban landscape, in Bucharest as well as in the [[Black Sea]] port of [[Constanța]] (where [[Petre Antonescu]] and Frenchman [[Daniel Renard]] designed the [[Constanța Casino]]).&lt;ref name="vmlisabona"/&gt; This urban renaissance also enlisted contributions from [[Nicolae Ghica-Budești]], also known as a Secession [[interior design]]er,&lt;ref&gt;Barend, p.89; Sandqvist, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ion D.

==Symbolist expansion==

===Regional branches===
The reaction against parochialism and traditionalism was strengthened by the diffusion of Symbolism and Decadentism into other the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]]'s provincial areas, as well as by the steady influx of disappointed [[middle-class]] provincials into Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.16-17, 59, 203-204; Vianu, Vol. II, p.390&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist and Symbolist promoter [[Constantin Beldie]] recorded in his memoirs the arrival into the capital of "so many young men with their hair grown and with no [[cuff]]s on their shirts", leaving their places of origin "because their parents did not understand them" and motivated by the encouragements "of some literary sheet or another, that would eventually be dragged down into the murky waters of journalism."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; The fascination of provincial Romanian adolescents with the poetic themes of Symbolism was later documented (and criticized) in the novel ''[[La Medeleni]]'', by the traditionalist [[Ionel Teodoreanu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Angelo Mitchievici]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/MEDELENIiul8.html "''La Medeleni'': hotarul nevăzut"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

According to definitions from both within and without the Symbolist movement, there followed a structuring of Symbolism along the cultural priorities or characteristics of [[Historical regions of Romania|historical regions]]: an extrovert and suggestive school, heralded by Macedonski himself, in the southwestern province of Wallachia; and a [[Melancholia|melancholic]] branch to the north and east, in [[Moldavia]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.16-17, 37-38, 52; Vianu, Vol. III, p.386-388&lt;/ref&gt; The "Wallachians", primarily judged as exponents of an artistic approach, are Macedonski, Demetrescu and [[Ion Pillat]], alongside [[Alexandru Colorian]], [[Elena Farago]], [[Barbu Solacolu]], [[Eugeniu Ștefănescu-Est]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.16. See also Vianu, Vol. III, p.386&lt;/ref&gt; Of special note among the Symbolists emerging from Wallachia, [[Al. T. Stamatiad]] was a cherished disciple of Macedonski, who left flowery erotic verse and, in succession to Petică's Aestheticism, [[prose poem]]s loosely based on those of [[Oscar Wilde]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.523, 686, 701-702, 858&lt;/ref&gt;

At the other end of the spectrum, the early representatives of "Moldavian" Symbolism include Petică, Bacovia, Anghel, [[Gabriel Donna]], [[Alfred Moșoiu]], [[I. M. Rașcu]] and [[Alexandru Vițianu]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.16, 21; See also Vianu, Vol. III, p.386-388&lt;/ref&gt; According to literary historian [[Ovid Crohmălniceanu]], the spread of [[Modernist literature|literary modernism]] in general was helped along by "a certain insurgent fever of souls brought up in small Moldavian ''[[târg]]uri'' and exasperated by their somnolent atmosphere".&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.16"&gt;Cernat, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; Cernat also asserts: "The dramatic lessening in administrative importance of [[Iași]]—Moldavia's former capital—generated a strong feeling of frustration among local intellectuals".&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.16"/&gt;

A distinct product of "Moldavian" Symbolism was the Iași-based review ''[[Vieața Nouă]]'', founded in 1905 by the aspiring academic [[Ovid Densusianu]], and published until 1925. Critics have suggested that Densusianu's image of Symbolism was rather complex and its agenda still eclectic: ''Vieața Nouă'' harbored a group of authors with distinct Neoclassical traits, who treasured [[free verse]] as a puristic form of poetic expression.&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.8; Călinescu, p.683-685; Cernat, p.16, 20-22, 31, 56, 61, 94-95, 297, 402&lt;/ref&gt; The periodical was characterized not just by an advocacy of urban and [[Westernization|Westernized]] culture, but also by a strong interest in the common heritage of [[Romance languages]] and tendencies toward [[Pan-Latinism]],&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.683-684; Cernat, p.20-21, 297; Vianu, Vol. III, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; with Densusianu calling into question the traditionalist notion that Romanian purity was only preserved in the countryside.&lt;ref name="Sandqvist, p.202"&gt;Sandqvist, p.202&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vieața Nouă'' frequently published translations of modern French authors, from [[Remy de Gourmont]] and [[Marcel Proust]] to [[Paul Claudel]].&lt;ref&gt;Cubleșan, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine also enlisted the participation of Densusianu's disciples in the field of literary criticism, within Moldavia and elsewhere: [[D. Caracostea]], [[Pompiliu Păltânea]] and [[Petre Haneș]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.683, 710-711; Cernat, p.61. See also Vianu, Vol. III, p.130-131, 134-140&lt;/ref&gt; With that, the influence of "academic" Symbolism stretched into Romania's new province of [[Northern Dobruja]], where poet [[Al. Gherghel]] was stationed.&lt;ref name="gvsase"&gt;{{ro icon}} Geo Vasile, [http://www.romlit.ro/ase_poei_uitai "Șase poeți uitați"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 31/2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Densusianu's academic current is seen with some reserve by researchers, who argued that its followers were only accidentally Symbolist, and primarily advocates of conventional approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.683; Cernat, p.61&lt;/ref&gt; According to literary historian [[George Călinescu]], Densusianu was more a Francophile than a Symbolist, and, as an immigrant from [[Transylvania]] (at the time in [[Austria-Hungary]]), out of touch with "the spirit of the new school."&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.683"&gt;Călinescu, p.683&lt;/ref&gt; In Cernat's view, Densusianu's "tastelessness" and "narrow dogmatism" were a downgrading factor within the Symbolist environment, indirectly contributing to a schism between the Neoclassical and innovative sides of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.21, 22&lt;/ref&gt; Although noted by the traditionalists as a most polemical magazine&lt;ref name="Chendi, p.63"&gt;Chendi, p.63&lt;/ref&gt; and somewhat successful in its competition with ''Junimea'',&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.11, 16, 246, 248-249&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vieața Nouă'' remained a minor addition to the literary landscape, with very low circulation.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.97&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Sămănătorist'' reaction and 1908 revival===
Especially after 1905, the Symbolist trend was faced with a stronger reaction from the traditionalist and [[Ethnic nationalism|ethno-nationalist]] camp, headed by the new literary magazine ''[[Sămănătorul]]''. Through historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], who was for a while its leading exponent, this circle instigated the public against Francophilia and cosmopolitanism, to the point of organizing the large-scale nationalist riots held in front of the [[National Theater Bucharest]] (1906).&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.353; Călinescu, p.683; Cernat, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga found Symbolism trivial, calling it "''[[Lupanar (Pompeii)|lupanarium]]'' literature",&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Adina-Ștefania Ciurea, [http://www.romlit.ro/scriitori_n_boxa_acuzailor "Scriitori în boxa acuzaților"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 33/2003&lt;/ref&gt; while, in critic [[Ilarie Chendi]], the traditionalist magazines found a vocal adversary of Macedonski's influence.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.639; Teacă, p.68; Vianu, Vol. II, p.391&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, ''Sămănătorul'' cultivated its own [[Neo-romanticism|neoromatic]] branch of the Symbolist current, which Cernat described as a sign that the conservative segment of Symbolism was also emancipating itself.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; The Symbolist-''Sămănătorist'' wing was notably represented by two of the magazine's leading contributors: [[Ștefan Octavian Iosif]] and his friend Dimitrie Anghel.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.601-605, 683-691; Cernat, p.16-19, 21, 73; Ornea, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; Anghel's collaboration with Iosif took the for of a literary duo, a significant product of which was the neoromantic drama ''Legenda funigeilor'' ("Gossamer Legend", 1907).&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.597, 665, 689-691; Cernat, p.272&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sămănătorul'' also opened itself to contributions from other authors formed by Symbolism, from Petică and Stamatiad&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.601; Cernat, p.18-19, 21&lt;/ref&gt; to Farago and [[Alice Călugăru]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.681, 702-705. See also Cornis-Pope, p.232, 233&lt;/ref&gt;

Also at that stage, first-generation Symbolism in general was becoming more accepted by the cultural establishment, engendering some mutations at the movement's core. In contrast to their teacher Macedonski, several Romanian Symbolists were adopting neoromantic attitudes and viewing Eminescu's poetry with more sympathy, treasuring those Eminescian traits which were closest to Decadentism (idealism, moroseness, exoticism).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.11, 21, 26, 27, 209, 211, 227. See also: Braga, p.9, 16; Marian, p.112-113&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, more radical traditionalist ideologues such as Iorga continued to view the current with alarm: in 1905, Iorga notably used ''Sămănătorul'' to state his dislike for Anghel's floral-themed poetry, which he believed was suited to "boyar" tastes.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; On a more intimate level, Petică, seen by Mihai Zamfir as "the most Eminescian Romanian poet",&lt;ref name="mzpetica"/&gt; was developing an original ethno-nationalist interpretation of art, infused with [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.685; Cernat, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction, a Symbolist core was defining itself as the [[Elitism|elitist]] alternative to the ''Sămănătorul'' [[populism]].&lt;ref name="Sandqvist, p.202"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nmminulescu"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Nicolae Manolescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/ion_minulescu "Ion Minulescu"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 51-52/2003&lt;/ref&gt; By 1908, poet [[Ion Minulescu]] was becoming the new herald of Romanian Symbolism, or, according to George Călinescu, its "most integral exponent".&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.691&lt;/ref&gt; Minulescu's ascendancy was nevertheless synonymous with the movement's decline, inaugurating a mutation into the [[avant-garde]].&lt;ref&gt;Braga, ''passim''; Cernat, p.8, 15-17, 21-29, 46-47&lt;/ref&gt; His short-lived periodical, ''[[Revista Celor L'alți]]'', was notorious for publishing the manifesto ''Aprindeți torțele!'' ("Light Up the Torches!"), viewed by critics as either the first explicitly Symbolist document of its kind or the earliest voice of the avant-garde.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.8, 15, 25-26, 97; Sandqvist, p.202-203&lt;/ref&gt; It suggested to the readers that the "literary present" needed to be "lit up", claiming to align itself with those "young people who have the courage of tearing themselves from the crowd."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto went on to explain Minulescu's take on artistic revolution: "[Young people] can only view the past with respect. They reserve their love for the future. [...] Liberty and individuality in art, the preservation of old forms acquired from their elders, the tendency in favor of things new, quaint, bizarre even, only extracting the characteristic parts out of life [...] and only focusing on things that set one man apart from another. [...] If literary tradition finds a revolutionary color on such flagpoles, so be it—we accept it!"&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.25-26&lt;/ref&gt; Sandqvist summarizes the general objective as: "Art must create something new in any case, always and everywhere".&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p.203&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism meets Futurism and Expressionism===
Minulescu's moment of glory was unusual in its European context. Paul Cernat, who interprets ''Aprindeți torțele!'' as a Symbolist work inspired by the ideas of French cultural critic [[Remy de Gourmont]], notes that, despite the movement's goal of reaching simultaneity with [[Western culture]], the moment of its publication came twenty years after France's original ''[[Symbolist Manifesto]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.8, 25-27, 97&lt;/ref&gt; By then, Cernat also notes, international Symbolism was falling behind the more vocally [[anti-establishment]] expressions of modernism: [[Acmeist poetry|Acmeism]], [[Cubism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Futurism]] etc., several of which were coming to describe the older movement as effeminate and compromised.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.8, 12-14, 21-23, 83-95, 97&lt;/ref&gt; As in [[German-speaking Europe|Germanic Europe]], the Art Nouveau scene of Romania was acting as a catalyst for the new Expressionist tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu, p.428; Pavel, p.75-78, 83-89&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion that Romanian Symbolism was belated to the point of anachronism is supported by other commentators. George Călinescu wrote: "[[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]], [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]], the Parnassians and the Symbolists were only discovered in our country almost a century after their emergence [in France]."&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.683"/&gt; According to Sandqvist: "The Romanian context is characterized by the fact that the Romanian writers did not synchronize their symbolism with the contemporary, academicized phase of French symbolism, but went straight to the sources and sought out none other than [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]], Baudelaire, Verlaine, and [[Stéphane Mallarmé|Mallarmé]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p.170&lt;/ref&gt; Literary historian [[Eugen Negrici]] reacts against the "illusion" according to which Romanian Symbolism announced the modernist phenomenon, while also arguing: "When, around 1900, French Symbolism was exhausted as a recipe, the Romanian one was just about getting born. Its flowering at roughly the same time as modern European poetry was configuring its typology is what has been leading us to proclaim its modernity."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Eugen Negrici]], [http://www.cuvantul.ro/articol/?artID=33&amp;nr=371 "Iluziile literaturii române"], in ''[[Cuvântul (literary magazine)|Cuvântul]]'', Nr. 371&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-1908 effort of synchronization with the European scene was a conscious one on the part of some Romanian Symbolists. Citing previous verdicts, linguist Manuela-Delia Suciu suggests that the period saw poets moving closer to the practice of Symbolism, overcoming the mainly theoretical and post-Romantic phase of the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Suciu, p.109&lt;/ref&gt; Sandqvist reports: "Contemporary writers and intellectuals, as well as 'ordinary' readers, were shocked as much by the [''Revista Celor L'alți'' group's] disillusioned, sarcastic, and bizarre way of handling lyrical motifs with the help of, for instance, intertwined sounds, colors, and scents, as by their choice of subject matter, where the city parks, the streets, and the buildings are inhabited by prostitutes, criminals, the insane, and [[erotomania]]cs and where hospitals, restaurants, cathedrals, and palaces play a prominent role as 'scenes of the crime.' Everything anguished, neurotic, macabre, bizarre, exotic, unusual, theatrical, grotesque, [[elegiac]], light-hearted, sensuous, dripping, and monotonous was celebrated as well as everything trivial, everyday, tedious, and empty, at the same time as the poets were borrowing freely from world literature, blending images and metaphors, motifs, and atmospheres."&lt;ref name="Sandqvist, p.202"/&gt;

Minulescu's columns in ''Revista Celor L'alți'', like his parallel articles for ''[[Viitorul]]'' daily, popularized the works of Symbolist and post-Symbolist writers, from Rimbaud, [[Jules Laforgue]], [[Albert Samain]] and the [[Comte de Lautréamont]] to [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]].&lt;ref name="nmminulescu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.26-27. See also: Sandqvist, p.170, 202-203, 237; Ștefănescu, p.306; Șotropa (2009), p.40&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cernat, ''Revista Celor L'alți''{{'}}s choice of name (literally, "the others' magazine") indicated a break with Densusianu's version of Symbolism, although the ''Vieața Nouă'' doyen still contributed to Minulescu's review.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1908, ''Vieața Nouă'' had published Densusianu's influential praise of free verse poetry, ''Versul liber și dezvoltarea estetică a limbii literare'' ("Free Verse and the Aesthetic Development of the [[Literary language|Literary Language]]").&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.15"/&gt; In particular, news about the spread of Futurism divided local writers: Densusianu's skepticism&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p.244&lt;/ref&gt; was overshadowed by the indignation of [[Dumitru Karnabatt]]. The latter, who would subsequently become a contributor to traditionalist papers,&lt;ref&gt;Chendi, p.61&lt;/ref&gt; suggested at the time that all the Futurists were insane.&lt;ref name="ipviitor"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Pop (literary historian)|Ion Pop]], [http://www.romlit.ro/un_viitor_de_o_sut_de_ani "Un viitor de o sută de ani"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 7/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolist bohemians===
[[File:Stefan Dimitrescu - La Otetelesanu.jpg|thumb|340px|''La Oteteleșanu'' ("[[Terasa Oteteleșanu|Oteteleșanu's]]") or ''La berărie'' ("In the Beer-house"), 1915 satirical painting by the traditionalist [[Ștefan Dimitrescu]]]] 
Minulescu's own poetry of the period was noted for its insolent and flamboyant language, its urban themes and its inspiration from [[Romance (music)|romanzas]]—all characteristics attributed by critics to the Wallachian tradition within Symbolism.&lt;ref name="nmminulescu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.658, 691-697, 702, 814, 832, 835, 842-843, 930, 938; Cernat, p.15, 16, 17, 22-29, 31, 65, 87-88; Sandqvist, p.170, 202-209, 237, 374; Vianu, Vol. III, p.374-382&lt;/ref&gt; Its success with a middle class feminine public was reportedly devastating;&lt;ref name="nmminulescu"/&gt; it also unusually earned Minulescu the respect of a leading ''Junimea''-bred satirist, [[Ion Luca Caragiale]],&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.22; Sandqvist, p.209&lt;/ref&gt; noted earlier for his derision of Macedonskian Symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ioana Pârvulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/nimeni_nu_poate_sri_peste_umbra_epocii_lui "Nimeni nu poate sări peste umbra epocii lui"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 23/2009; Vianu, Vol. II, p.177, 184, 188, 366, 373-376, 387&lt;/ref&gt;

In Minulescu's time, the Symbolist movement began cultivating a [[Bohemianism|bohemian society]], which in turn rested on Romania's older [[coffee culture]]. Its use of [[coffeehouse]]s as informal clubs consequently became at once a mark of Romanian Symbolism and a characteristic of early 20th century literary life.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.692, 694, 695; Cernat, p.15, 17, 22-23, 51, 137, 203-204; Sandqvist, p.118, 120-121, 130, 197, 203-204; Vianu, Vol. III, p.128-131&lt;/ref&gt; The Symbolists' example in this respect was taken up by traditionalist authors: the two currents soon after faced each other on a daily basis, debating lively in Bucharest establishments such as ''[[Casa Capșa]]'', ''[[Kübler Coffeehouse|Kübler]]'' and ''[[Terasa Oteteleșanu]]''.&lt;ref name="sfmasa"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.15, 16, 17, 44, 51, 91; Sandqvist, p.118, 120-121, 130, 197, 203-204. See also Drăguț ''et al.'', p.208&lt;/ref&gt; The two camps were however united by professional interest, and together created the [[Romanian Writers' Society]], which became functional in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Cassian Maria Spiridon]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/TATAapr8.html "Secolul breslei scriitoricești"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant event occurred in 1912, when Macedonski made his return from an extended stay in [[Paris]]. His cause charmed the younger poets, among whom [[Ion Pillat]] and [[Horia Furtună]] became his dedicated promoters and publicists.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.380-381; Vol. III, p.350-355&lt;/ref&gt; The late Symbolist period was especially important for Pillat and Furtună, whose poems adhere closely to the models set by Macedonski (in Pillat's case, with an emphasis on exoticism).&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.727, 857-861; Vianu, Vol. III, p.350-361&lt;/ref&gt; Pillat's Symbolist debut also had an international aspect: familiarized in Paris with the French Symbolist and Parnassians, he translated their work at home, presided over an "Academy of the 10" while in France, and later authored definitive anthologies of Symbolist poetry.&lt;ref name="cpvolupt"&gt;{{ro icon}} Cornelia Pillat, [http://www.romlit.ro/voluptatea_lecturii "Voluptatea lecturii"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 35/1999. See also Balotă, p.97-98&lt;/ref&gt; Pillat's colleague [[Tudor Vianu]], who spoke about his own affiliation with Ovid Densusianu's Symbolism in 1913, described the cultural significance of renewed debates: "Romanian Symbolism was a chapter in the permanent ''[[Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns|querelle des anciens et des modernes]]''. We [Symbolists] were inspired by the idea that modern life may enter the universal synthesis of art and that, once he rises above the archaism and traditionalism of consecrated literary models, a poet must test himself on the road toward those subjects that characterize the life and the civilization of his own age."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. III, p.128-129&lt;/ref&gt; The informal faction, regrouped around Macedonski, Davidescu and Stamatiad, was soon joined by [[Alexandru Dominic]], [[Oreste Georgescu]], [[Adrian Maniu]] and [[Marcel Romanescu]];&lt;ref name="cpvolupt"/&gt; those who also followed Densusianu included Vianu, [[Alexandru Colorian]], [[Anastasie Mândru]] and several other young poets.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. III, p.127-129&lt;/ref&gt;

===Left-wing contacts===
In the wake of Romania's [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|1907 Peasants' Revolt]], Symbolism was consolidating its links with the [[left-wing]] movements, which were at the time recovering from the split of Dobrogeanu-Gherea's [[Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party]] into several small groups. The leftist representatives of Symbolism were finding new allies among the scattered socialist circles and setting up connections with [[Poporanism]], the leftist version of traditionalism. Such contacts were built on Arghezi's collaboration with socialist activist [[N. D. Cocea]] and the left-leaning writer [[Gala Galaction]] (later known as a [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] theologian), who had started their relationship while working on ''Linia Dreaptă'', moving on to create ''[[Viața Socială]]'', ''[[Rampa (Romanian magazine)|Rampa]]'' and then on a succession of short-lived papers.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.678, 681, 808; Cernat, p.8, 18, 22, 23, 29-32, 34-35, 39, 44, 61-75, 90, 98, 313, 402; Vianu, Vol. III, p.278-280, 315, 479-481. See also Chendi, p.63&lt;/ref&gt; The mix of Symbolists and socialists was described as ineffectual by the traditionalist witness Chendi, who, in 1912, argued: "Mr. Cocea wanted to break through and resorted to our young Decadents and Symbolists in Bucharest, who nevertheless, having not one thing in common with the doctrines of socialism, could not pay as much service to the magazine [''Viața Socială''] as to prevent from going under, in explicable manner."&lt;ref name="Chendi, p.63"/&gt;

In Cocea's case, this opening toward [[modern art]] was motivated by his generic interest in cultural innovation, explained by him as a wish to surpass both "antiquated artistic formulas" and "the laws of nature".&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.8"/&gt; His own literary contribution, only partly connected with Decadentism, was often in the [[Erotic literature|explicitly erotic genre]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.919; Cernat, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Arghezi, who had by that moment embarked on and forfeited a career in Orthodox monasticism, was beginning to merge influences from Symbolism with traditionalist and avant-garde [[poetics]], into a new original format.&lt;ref&gt;Balotă, p.9-34, 48, 71, 73, 75-76, 84, 112; Călinescu, p.51, 589, 658, 690, 694, 808-819, 826, 866, 868, 870, 875, 879, 884, 903, 906-907, 942, 944; Cernat, p.8, 9, 15, 21-22, 34, 48, 53, 56-57, 77, 122, 123, 139-141, 148-150, 184, 203, 207, 273, 275-277, 299, 321-322, 334-336, 339-340, 344-345, 349, 351; Sandqvist, p.4, 130, 234, 374; Vianu, Vol. II, p.451; Vol. III, p.359, 394, 484-503&lt;/ref&gt; His disappointment with the Church experience was by then also manifested in his search for an alternative [[spirituality]], his vocal [[anticlericalism]] and his interest in [[Christian heresy]].&lt;ref&gt;Balotă, p.27-34; Călinescu, p.809-814, 816, 818-819, 911, 929; Cernat, p.15, 17-18, 141, 148-149&lt;/ref&gt;

A promoter of both Decadentism and [[Didacticism|didactic art]], Gala Galaction was affiliated with the main Poporanist venue, ''[[Viața Românească]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.678-681; Cernat, p.8, 34; Vianu, Vol. II, p.367, 369; Vol. III, p.274-295&lt;/ref&gt; The latter magazine, occupying the middle ground between Dobrogeanu-Gherea's socialism and ''Sămănătorism'', was generally opposed to art for art's sake, but had its own separate links with the Symbolist environment. These reached to the top of its editorial board: the publication's ideologue and co-founder [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]] sympathized with its [[lyricism]], and, like various other writers from the Poporanist schools, adopted Decadent themes in his own works of fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.19, 20, 21, 29-32, 34, 90. See also Vianu, Vol. III, p.95-07&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, the review also hosted one of the first scholarly studies of Symbolism to be produced in Romania, the work of woman critic [[Izabela Sadoveanu-Evan]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.20, 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; Progressively after that date, the Poporanist circle opened itself toward those representatives of Symbolist poetry who had parted with Densusianu's branch, upholding Arghezi as a major Romanian author.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.21-22, 30. See also Chendi, p.62&lt;/ref&gt; It also provided exposure to distinct representatives of feminine Symbolist poetry, illustrated there by Alice Călugăru or Farago.&lt;ref&gt;Cornis-Pope, p.232&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the aesthetic implications of Ibrăileanu's traditionalism and ''Viața Românească''{{'}}s cooperation with the governing [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] drew criticism from the more radical Cocea.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, another distinct link with leftist politics was preserved through the [[Proletarian literature|proletarian-themed school]] of Symbolist poetry, inaugurated by [[Traian Demetrescu]] and later illustrated by Bacovia, [[Mihail Cruceanu]], [[Andrei Naum]], [[Alexandru Toma]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.16, 18&lt;/ref&gt; This wing of Symbolism, together with the Arghezi-Galaction tandem, also enjoyed close relationships with some advocates of [[Social Realism]], among them [[I. C. Vissarion]] and [[Vasile Demetrius]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.17, 29, 30, 74-75, 98&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolist climate and modern art venues===
[[File:Ion Theodorescu-Sion - Lux in tenebris lucet.JPG|thumb|220px|[[Ion Theodorescu-Sion]], ''Lux in tenebris lucet'', 1909]]
The literary mutation was echoed in local modern art, where the currents emerging from [[post-Impressionism]], [[Synthetism]] and Fauvism were being slowly acclimatized. This transition was in large part owed to graphic artist [[Iosif Iser]], known for his adversity to Secession art, but also for his contributions to the [[German Empire|German]] ''[[Jugend (magazine)|Jugend]]''&lt;ref name="plsbrittany"/&gt; and his borrowings from Art Nouveau cartoonists like [[Thomas Theodor Heine]] and [[Félix Vallotton]].&lt;ref&gt;Pavel, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, Iser organized a Bucharest exhibit of works by French-based modernists [[André Derain]], [[Jean-Louis Forain]] and [[Demetrios Galanis]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.15-16, 25, 46, 407&lt;/ref&gt; Also famous as the illustrator of Minulescu and Arghezi,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.25, 47&lt;/ref&gt; he progressively incorporated the newer artistic styles into his personal palette—resulting in what some have called "Iserism".&lt;ref name="mvipostaze"/&gt; Like many other artists and writers, he frequented Bogdan-Pitești's newly founded Bucharest club or the artists' colony his patron had set up in [[Colonești, Olt|Colonești]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.39, 43-44, 402, 405-406, 407&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Semiotics|semiotician]] [[Sorin Alexandrescu]], there emerged a pattern of anti-Symbolism among Romanian painters, including those who studied with French Symbolist teachers.&lt;ref name="sapitoresciv"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Sorin Alexandrescu]], [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=8939 "Bucureștiul pitoresc (IV)"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', September 2, 2005 (republished by the [[Romanian Cultural Institute]]'s [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ ''România Culturală''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902021335/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ |date=2011-09-02 }})&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandrescu writes that Romanian art students were "opaque to both the symbolic substance and the decorative efflorescence that so enthused the Paris of their formative years", only preserving from this environment a love for the "[[picturesque]]".&lt;ref name="sapitoresciv"/&gt; Art historians have traditionally placed the moment of rebellion in visual arts in or around 1910, when ''Tinerimea Artistică'' finally split into traditionalist-classical Symbolist wing and a modernist one.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.45-46, 156; Juvara, p.77-79; Sandqvist, p.184&lt;/ref&gt; The period also witnessed the arrival into art criticism of Symbolist poet [[Theodor Cornel]]. Although he died a young man in 1911, Cornel is credited with having introduced Romanians to the [[Primitivism|primitivist]] and exotic tendencies of post-Impressionism, and to have been among the first authoritative critics in the country to discuss such new phenomena as Cubism or [[Abstract art|Abstraction]],&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.45-47. See also: Grigorescu, p.430; Pavel, p.72-74&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes in competition with the Moldavian Expressionist painter [[Arthur Segal (painter)|Arthur Segal]].&lt;ref name="mvipostaze"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p.183-184&lt;/ref&gt; This context produced the first works by Romanian primitivists: [[Cecilia Cuțescu-Storck]], [[Friedrich Storck]], [[Ion Theodorescu-Sion]], and, foremost among them, sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.46-47, 340, 398; Sandqvist, p.184. See also Pavel, p.74-75, 92-94&lt;/ref&gt;

Of this group, Brâncuși did not generally follow the Symbolist guidelines, and instead reached international fame with an original semi-abstract modernist style influenced by [[Romanian folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.15, 46-48, 157, 199, 212, 224-225, 238-239, 311, 324, 331, 392, 398, 404, 409; Grigorescu, p.26, 134, 408-409; Juvara, p.78-79; Pavel, p.81, 97-98; Sandqvist, p.184, 249-251, 255, 351, 353; Vanci, p.216-217. For the Symbolist roots of Brâncuși's art, see also: Șotropa (2007), p.22, 23-24; Matei Stîrcea-Crăciun, "La dimension symboliste de la sculpture brancusienne.

Série Beaux-arts'', 2007, p.83-88; Vlasiu, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; Theodorescu-Sion also discarded all forms of Symbolism by the end of the decade, and incorporated into his art the solid shape painting of [[Paul Cézanne]],&lt;ref name="mvlola"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mariana Vida, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Intre-tensiunile-expresionismului-si-noul-umanism*articleID_14558-articles_details.html "Între tensiunile expresionismului și noul umanism"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 300-301, December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; while Cuțescu-Storck was still a classical Symbolist in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;M. Vida (2007), p.63; Teacă, p.70&lt;/ref&gt; With draftsman [[Ary Murnu]], she contributed Art Nouveau illustrations to the ''Tinerimea'' catalogs.&lt;ref&gt;M. Vida (2007), p.56, 66&lt;/ref&gt; By 1911, ''Tinerimea'' had also received into its ranks the painter [[Theodor Pallady]], whose debut works were dominated by Symbolist imagery,&lt;ref name="msriècle"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Vida (2007), p.63; Teacă, p.68-69&lt;/ref&gt; but who was later a prominent anti-Symbolist.&lt;ref name="sapitoresciv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drăguț ''et al.'', p.185-186&lt;/ref&gt;

The new generation of Romanian Symbolist artists also included several sculptors who, like Brâncuși, trained with French master [[Auguste Rodin]]: [[Horia Boambă]], [[Teodor Burcă]], [[Anghel Chiciu]], [[Filip Marin]], [[Ion Jalea]], [[Dimitrie Paciurea]], [[Alexandru Severin]].&lt;ref name="mcvisuri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Șotropa (2007), p.23-26&lt;/ref&gt; Boambă earned a short-lived notoriety with works contrasting delicate figures with rough surfaces, while Marin alternated academic busts with Symbolist statuettes.&lt;ref&gt;Șotropa (2007), p.24-26&lt;/ref&gt; A poet as well as sculptor, Severin was close to Alexandru Macedonski, with whom he founded ''Cenaclul Idealist'' ("The Idealist Club"), also including painters [[Alexis Macedonski]], [[Leon Alexandru Biju]] and [[Dimitrie Mihăilescu]].&lt;ref name="mcvisuri"/&gt; His sculptures, notably exhibited at the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] in 1908, displayed his interest in the mysterious or expressed his admiration for Rodin.&lt;ref&gt;Șotropa (2007), p.24-25&lt;/ref&gt; The young Paciurea was mainly adapting Rodin's Impressionist themes to the Romanian historist school, and only later became a truly Symbolist artist.&lt;ref&gt;Șotropa (2007), p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Insula'' and ''Simbolul''===
[[File:Alexandru Szathmary - Interior oriental.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Alexandru Satmari]], ''Interior oriental'' ("Oriental Interior", 1916), with a portrait of [[Claudia Millian]]]]
Since shortly before the [[Second Balkan War]] and continuing down to [[World War I]], local Symbolism experienced other more radical mutations into the avant-garde. Paul Cernat suggests that this interval brought into existence a "Symbolism of the independents" or "people's Symbolism", opposed to Densusianu's version but indebted to "Minulescianism", to Bacovia and to Arghezi.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.22-23&lt;/ref&gt; The new expression of Romanian Symbolism, Cernat also notes, was playful, theatrical and centered on the ''[[petite bourgeoisie]]'', receiving post-Symbolist influences not just from Expressionism and Futurism, but also from [[Imagism]], [['Pataphysics]] or ''[[Zutisme]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.22-23, 26-32, 50-54, 61-75, 88-93, 95, 341, 402&lt;/ref&gt; As the inventor of Futurism and propagandist of the new artistic credo, [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] maintained close links with Romanian intellectuals, efforts which notably brought him into contact with Alexandru Macedonski.&lt;ref name="dgactiv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.88-89; Sandqvist, p.200, 235-245, 383&lt;/ref&gt;

These new tendencies made an impact on the work of established figures within the Symbolist movement. Minulescu began infusing his original Symbolist style with borrowings from more radical modernists, becoming one of the few Romanian authors of the 1910s to incorporate elements of Futurism,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.8-9, 26-29, 87-88, 174-175&lt;/ref&gt; and introducing some Expressionist techniques in his works for the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.696. Braga, who denies Minulescu's Symbolism and sees him as a [[Neo-Romanticism|neoromantic]], also notes that some of his poetry is the literary equivalent of paintings by [[Paul Gauguin]] (p.11-12).&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, Bacovia modified his own style by appropriating characteristics of Expressionist poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.9; Cernat, p.23, 71. See also Grigorescu, p.373, 416&lt;/ref&gt; Among the new representatives of this trend were the innovative poet [[Adrian Maniu]] and his younger emulators, [[Ion Vinea]] and [[Tristan Tzara]]. All of them, in varying degrees, owed inspiration to the innovative Symbolism of Laforgue, whose hallmark poetic motif, that of the hanged man, they each reworked into tribute poems.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.23, 52&lt;/ref&gt; Maniu parted with Symbolism almost immediately after this stage, and the form of post- and anti-Symbolist [[experimental literature]] he generated helped to inspire similar moves on his colleagues' part.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.702, 708, 822-824, 838, 888, 896, 907; Cernat, p.50-54, 72, 91, 97, 119, 143-144, 325, 341, 397-398, 412, 887, 896-897; Grigorescu, p.413-415; Sandqvist, p.75, 128-130, 166, 170, 244-245, 374&lt;/ref&gt;

Published in spring 1912, Minulescu's new review ''Insula'' consecrated some of these developments. In Cernat's view, the new publication surpassed ''Revista Celor L'alți'' in both radicalism and public exposure.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.27"&gt;Cernat, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; It hosted contributions by poet and critic [[N. Davidescu]], who clarified the magazine's position in a series of articles, postulating a difference between Decadentism (seen as a negative phenomenon and identified as such with traditionalism) and Symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.27-28&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, his texts spoke about Futurism as having some "absurd and useless parts", and being overall monotonous.&lt;ref name="ipviitor"/&gt; Davidescu's own poetry of the period modernized borrowings from Baudelaire, Macedonski and [[Paul Verlaine]], exploring the exotic and the macabre.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.697-698&lt;/ref&gt;

The circle of ''Insula'' affiliates notably included Bacovia, Beldie, Cruceanu, Dragoslav, Karnabatt, Ștefănescu-Est, Vițianu, and (on his literary debut) Maniu.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.27"/&gt; They were joined by [[Șerban Bascovici]], [[D. Iacobescu]], [[Emil Isac]], [[Mihail Săulescu]], [[Theodor Solacolu]], [[Eugeniu Sperantia]], [[Dem. Theodorescu]] and Minulescu's wife [[Claudia Millian]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.27-28, 65, 104&lt;/ref&gt; These authors illustrated a diversity of approaches within the Symbolist milieu. Many preserved the fascination with the exotic, from Ștefănescu-Est's colorful depictions of imaginary lands to Săulescu's dreams of solitary [[atoll]]s, whereas Isac's version of Symbolism created unconventional lyrical pieces, mostly noted for their Imagism and their ironic twists.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.700-702, 710&lt;/ref&gt; The focus on decorative and artificial subjects was also preserved by Millian, in works which often depict scenes of seduction,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.835&lt;/ref&gt; and by Sperantia, who found his niche on the margin of Parnassianism.&lt;ref&gt;Cubleșan, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Minulescu's cheerfulness and in agreement with the Moldavian wing of the Symbolist movement, Iacobescu wrote sad poems reflecting his losing battle with [[tuberculosis]], and gained a following among young Romanian intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.709-710; Cernat, p.65; Vianu, Vol. III, p.86-91&lt;/ref&gt; Other than these writers, the ''Insula'' group played home to [[Nae Ionescu]], the future [[far right|far-right]] philosopher—at the time a cultural promoter with Futurist and [[Syndicalism|syndicalist]] sympathies.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.27, 28, 40-41, 51, 95, 137, 408&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the same year, Vinea, Tzara and graphic artist [[Marcel Janco]]—all still high school students at the time—began publishing ''[[Simbolul]]'' magazine. This new Symbolist and post-Symbolist tribune received contributions from Minulescu, from his ''Insula'' group, and even from Macedonski.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.48-51; Sandqvist, p.75, 196-197&lt;/ref&gt; Among the other contributors were [[Poldi Chapier]], [[Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo]], [[Barbu Solacolu]], [[Constantin T. Stoika]] and [[George Stratulat]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.49-51, 90, 99-100. See also Sandqvist, p.72-78&lt;/ref&gt; Especially through the articles of Maniu and Emil Isac, the paper made a point of shunning convention, rekindling polemics with the traditionalists.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.48-50; Sandqvist, p.75-77, 196-197&lt;/ref&gt; Janco, together with Iser, Maniu and Millian, provided the illustrations for the few issues ''Simbolul'' published before closing down in December 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.50, 100&lt;/ref&gt; Cocea's new socialist magazine, ''[[Facla]]'', signified the start of collaborations between the leftist activists and various of the ''Simbolul'' contributors. Illustrated by Iser, the magazine enlisted Vinea as a literary columnist—inaugurating the adolescent poet's parallel evolution into an opinion journalist with socially radical views.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.30, 61-75, 92-94, 97-108, 132-134, 131-145, 148, 205-208, 403&lt;/ref&gt; Rebelling against traditional, [[Positivism|positivist]] criticism, the young author made sustained efforts to familiarize his public with aesthetic alternatives: [[Walt Whitman]] and [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]'s poetry, Gourmont's essays, the theoretical particularities of [[Russian Symbolism]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.61-75, 92-94, 100-101, 108&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eclectic magazines===
[[File:Înşir'te mărgărite, Oradea, 1926.JPG|thumb|310px|Amateur actors in costume for a performance of ''[[Înșir'te mărgărite]]'' ([[Oradea]], 1926)]]
A product of Densusianu's school, the Iași-based magazine ''[[Versuri și Proză]]'' grouped various of Densusianu's admirers: [[I. M. Rașcu]] (the publication's founder), Cruceanu, Sperantia, Stamatiad, Vițianu.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.684-685; Cernat, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; Both Rașcu and Cruceanu favored a delicate Symbolism individualized by exotic settings (Cruceanu) or [[Roman Catholicism in Romania|Roman Catholic]] devotion (Rașcu).&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.705-706&lt;/ref&gt; ''Versuri și Proză'' nevertheless gave positive coverage to Futurism,&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p.243&lt;/ref&gt; hosting contributions from Arghezi, Bacovia, Macedonski and Minulescu alike,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.684; Cernat, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; as well as from more rebellious modernist authors and new wave Symbolists—including articles by its co-editor Hefter-Hidalgo, pieces by Maniu and the first-ever works signed by [[F. Brunea-Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.34, 55, 97, 108&lt;/ref&gt; The publication also registered the debut of [[Perpessicius]], later known as a poet and critic with Symbolist sensibilities,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.55, 313&lt;/ref&gt; and the early lyrical works of [[Nicolae Budurescu]] and [[Dragoș Protopopescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.684&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, others who followed Densusianu's principles went on to create provincial versions of ''Vieața Nouă'': ''Farul'', ''Sărbătoarea Eroilor'' and Stamatiad's ''Grădina Hesperidelor''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.31, 64, 97, 304&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolists like Minulescu or Arghezi also found unexpected backing from the conservative ''Junimist'' [[Mihail Dragomirescu]] and his disciple [[Ion Trivale]], [[art for art's sake]] advocates who allowed such works to be published in their ''[[Convorbiri Critice]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.8, 21-22, 31, 34. See also Călinescu, p.643-644&lt;/ref&gt; Their literary club was also home to Stamatiad, [[Anastasie Mândru]], [[I. Dragoslav]] and other young men who admired Macedonski.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.379-380&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude, Cernat suggests, was linked to Dragomirescu's personal preference for [[Richard Wagner]]'s theories on music, which showed a predisposition for modernism, and which had led him into a debate with his former mentor Maiorescu.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, art historian Adriana Șotropa notes that both Dragomirescu and Trivale promoted an individual form of Aestheticism,&lt;ref&gt;Șotropa (2009), p.39&lt;/ref&gt; while Dragomirescu biographer Adrian Tudorachi assessed that ''Convorbiri Critice'' and the Symbolists shared a love for "interiority" in literary expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ioana Cistelecan, [http://www.revistatribuna.ro/doc_db_site/tribuna/tribuna107.pdf "Dincolo de canon"], in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Nr. 107, February 2007, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such points of contact, Trivale was mostly noted for his overall rejection of Symbolist literature,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.644&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Convorbiri Critice'' circle endured as a permanent target for ridicule on the part of young modernists.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.7-8, 63&lt;/ref&gt; Another ''Junimist'' figure, [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]], opened his paper ''[[Noua Revistă Română]]'' to contributions from various figures in the Symbolist and modernist field. The conservative venue notably published Tzara's early poems, Cocea's art chronicles, the pro-Symbolist articles of novelist [[Felix Aderca]] and various pieces by the ''Simbolul'' group.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.8, 30-31, 34, 46, 47, 51, 54, 61, 89-91, 102-103, 108, 109, 308, 402, 408. See also: Călinescu, p.683; Chendi, p.63; Sandqvist, p.126, 196, 244&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-''Junimist'' magazines were joined in this context by [[Constantin Banu]]'s eclectic review, ''[[Flacăra]]'', itself noted for circulating the writings of young Symbolists and post-Symbolists.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.713, 808; Cernat, p.23, 32, 54, 61, 107-108, 213; Vianu, Vol. II, p.382; Vol. III, p.383&lt;/ref&gt; One new voice emerging from its circle was [[Victor Eftimiu]], whose work in drama was largely a neoromantic adaptation a [[fairy tale]] format, with the genre conventions introduced by [[Edmond Rostand]] (''[[Înșir'te mărgărite]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.713-716&lt;/ref&gt; His other contributions in verse moved between the extremes of Neoclassical reworkings of [[Greek mythology]] and sentimental Symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.688, 716-719, 722, 727, 837&lt;/ref&gt; Also affiliated for a while with ''Flacăra'', where he made his debut as a poet, [[Tudor Vianu]] later turned to a career in literary history, and was especially noted for the moderation of his views.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.912-913. See also: Balotă, p.256-269; Vianu, Vol. III, p.127-133&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to such critical inclusivism, the Symbolist movement profited from the intercession of established journalists with Symbolist credentials: Beldie, Cocea and Pillat, all of whom promoted it within the mainstream press.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.23, 30-31, 408&lt;/ref&gt; The environment hosted poet [[Barbu Nemțeanu]], whose version of Symbolism generally followed an "[[Intimism|intimist]]" perspective,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; alternating with humorous depictions of provincial life.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.709&lt;/ref&gt; Another poet in this succession was [[Luca Caragiale]], whose work stood for a cosmopolitan reinterpretation of urban [[kitsch]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.710&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross-cultural Symbolism and ethnic enclaves===
[[File:Hans Bulhardt - Female figure, drawing, 1907.JPG|thumb|150px|Ink drawing by [[Hans Bulhardt]] (1907)]]
A distinct milieu to participate in the post-Symbolist transition was that of [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish-Romanian]] writers and artists, a category to which Iacobescu, Nemțeanu, Aderca, Brunea-Fox, Hefter-Hidalgo, Iser, Janco and Tzara all belonged. Traditionally seen by various critics as a coagulating factor for the emerging avant-garde, to which they purportedly contributed their ideal of eluding ''[[shtetl]]'' culture, their protest in favor of [[Jewish Emancipation|political emancipation]], and their [[Secularism|secularist]] graft of [[Jewish philosophy]], these figures were received with interest by the left-wing Symbolists, who militated for cultural pluralism and social integration.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.32-38&lt;/ref&gt; Originally writing in the line of "Moldavian" Symbolism and Arghezi, to which he attached the influence of his [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] roots and [[bucolic]] echoes from Romanian traditionalism,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.11, 15, 16, 17, 34, 36-38, 56, 65, 98, 132, 135, 139-140, 143, 149, 153, 201, 203-204, 208-209, 211-213, 222-223, 226-227, 269, 271-274, 286-289, 292, 299, 307-308, 310, 324, 336, 398, 405-406, 408, 409, 410, 412, 413; Grigorescu, p.418-420&lt;/ref&gt; poet and critic [[Benjamin Fondane|Benjamin Fondane (Fundoianu)]] became a leading exponent of this process. Over the late 1910s also, his writings incorporated echoes from Expressionism, announcing his eventual presence at the forefront of Romania's avant-garde.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.35-36, 274; Grigorescu, p.418-420. See also Sandqvist, p.354-355&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years before World War I erupted on Romania's border, the Iași modernist environment witnessed the journalistic debut of two Jewish intellectuals, each of them owners of a literary review with Symbolist and leftist agendas who declared their allegiance to Arghezi: [[Eugen Relgis]] (''Fronda'') and [[Isac Ludo]] (''Absolutio'').&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.34, 55-57, 97, 98, 99, 402, 412&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, a Jewish and [[Zionism|Zionist]] application of Art Nouveau, directly inspired by the art of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician]] lithographer [[Ephraim Moses Lilien]], was developed in drawing by [[Reuven Rubin]] (whose paintings of the time experimented with primitivist aesthetics).&lt;ref&gt;Milly Heyd, "The Uses of Primitivism: Reuven Rubin in Palestine", in Ezra Mendelsohn (ed.), ''Art and Its Uses: The Visual Image and Modern Jewish Society. Studies in Contemporary Jewry, Vol. VI'', [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford etc., 1990, p.61-64.  {{ISBN|0-19-506188-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolism also covers an early period in the career of [[Lola Schmierer Roth]], the [[Galați]]-born Jewish artist.&lt;ref name="mvlola"/&gt;

Located at the time in Austria-Hungary, the regions of [[Transylvania]] and [[Banat]] were largely inhabited by [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian people]], but, before the [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|1918 political union]], were virtually untouched by Romanian Symbolism. Despite the Transylvanian origins of Densusianu, Iosif or Emil Isac, and the massive circulation of French Symbolist texts by the Romanian newspapers of [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] and [[Blaj]] (''Românul'', ''Unirea''),&lt;ref&gt;Ștefănescu, p.307&lt;/ref&gt; the impact of Symbolism among the Romanians on the northern slope of the [[Carpathians]] remained minor, and the appeal of traditionalist literature in such communities was virtually unchallenged.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.601-602, 683-685; Cernat, p.19-20, 50; Chendi, p.63-64&lt;/ref&gt; Some Symbolist echoes were captured in the poems of [[Octavian Goga]], editor of the traditionalist paper ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.610-611; Sandqvist, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the paintings of [[Octavian Smigelschi]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Vida, p.37-40&lt;/ref&gt;

This lack of interest was contrasted by the region's [[Hungarians|Magyar]] and [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon]] [[intelligentsia]], which assimilated international Art Nouveau and, more distantly, Symbolism as vehicles of national revival, in line with the architectural work of [[Ödön Lechner]]. In some of the Transylvanian urban centers, including [[Baia Mare|Baia Mare (Nagybánya)]], [[Oradea|Oradea (Nagyvárad)]], [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj (Kolozsvár)]], [[Târgu Mureș|Târgu Mureș (Marosvásárhely)]] and [[Timișoara|Timișoara (Temesvár)]], the public commissioned Art Nouveau buildings from major architects, such as Lechner and [[Otto Wagner]].&lt;ref name="vmlisabona"/&gt; Among the [[German language|German]]-speaking Transylvanian Saxons and the Romanians, an early Symbolism was promoted by [[Hans Bulhardt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Radu Popica, [http://tara-barsei.ro/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/popica2007.pdf "Tradiție și inovație în arta transilvăneană – cazul pictorului brașovean Hans Bulhardt"], in ''Țara Bârsei'', Nr. 6/2007, p.151-159; G. Vida, p.37&lt;/ref&gt; Transylvanian contributors to Symbolism and post-Symbolism in [[Hungarian art]] or [[Hungarian literature|literature]] include polymath [[Károly Kós]] and some early members of the [[Baia Mare School]] of painting.&lt;ref name="lb27-37"&gt;[[Leon Botstein]], "Out of Hungary: Bartók, Modernism and the Cultural Politics of Twentieth-Century Music", in Péter Laki (ed.), ''Bartók and His World'', [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton &amp; Chichester, 1995, p.27-37.  {{ISBN|0-691-00633-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vienna Secession aesthetics had some influence on several Transylvanian-born Hungarians, from Symbolist poet [[Endre Ady]]&lt;ref&gt;Berend, p.88; Fenyo, p.29-32; Sandqvist, p.55, 58&lt;/ref&gt; and [[20th-century classical music|modern classical]] composer [[Béla Bartók]]&lt;ref name="lb27-37"/&gt; to painters [[Emerich Tamás]], [[Árpád Vida]], [[István Balogh (painter)|István Balogh]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Vida, p.37, 40-46. See also Pavel, p.76-78&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, artist [[János Mattis-Teutsch]] moved between Secession Symbolism, ''[[Der Blaue Reiter]]'' and Abstraction, while also bridging the parallel developments of Hungarian, Saxon and Romanian art.&lt;ref&gt;Vanci, p.217-218. See also: Drăguț ''et al.'', p.259, 260; Grigorescu, p.128, 373, 389, 440, 442, 444; Pavel, p.76-78&lt;/ref&gt; This communication between Hungarian and Romanian Symbolism was also taken up by the early modernist magazine ''[[Nyugat]]'' (which notably published works by Isac)&lt;ref&gt;Fenyo, p.61-64&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Secession-inspired socialist painter [[Aurel Popp]].&lt;ref&gt;Drăguț ''et al.'', p.214-215; Pavel, p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late Symbolism==

===World War I splits and decline===
From late 1914 to early 1916, during the period when Romania conserved its neutrality while World War I raged in neighboring areas, the new Symbolist generation was also radicalizing itself on political grounds, identifying with ideals such as [[pacifism]] and [[proletarian internationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.22-23, 35, 39-40, 63-64, 97-108, 132-135, 139-140&lt;/ref&gt; The political message was expressed through a number of publications that were both literary and polemical in nature: Arghezi's ''Cronica'', Bogdan-Pitești's ''[[Seara (newspaper)|Seara]]'' and, most subversively, Cocea's ''[[Facla]]'' and ''[[Chemarea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.23, 30, 31-32, 34-35, 39, 45, 47, 51, 54, 61-75, 92-94, 97-110, 116-120, 132-135, 139-141, 148, 188, 402, 403, 405, 407. See also Sandqvist, p.4, 78, 125-128, 131-132, 170, 196, 244, 348, 355&lt;/ref&gt; The latter was edited by Vinea, and primarily functioned as an avatar of Cocea's political press, surfacing and resurfacing under various names in his attempt to elude wartime [[censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.97-108, 132-135&lt;/ref&gt; Its cultural agenda and its move away from Symbolism were however identified by Paul Cernat in the disparate graphic and literary elements: cover reproductions of works by [[Félix Vallotton]]; Tzara's first non-Symbolist poems and Vinea's own "incisive" program; satirical pieces ridiculing [[Nicolae Iorga]]'s new publications and the neo-''Sămănătorist'' current; polemics with the supporters of Romanian Symbolism at ''Vieața Nouă'' and ''Flacăra''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.97-110, 116-120, 403, 407&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than constituting a voice for the avant-garde, Cernat notes, ''Chemarea'' symbolized a moment when "the Romanian pre-avant-garde plugged itself into the pulse of a European-wide sensitivity touched by the radical crisis of its dominating values."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.108&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Sandqvist (building on previous assessments from Romanian writer [[Eugène Ionesco]]), discusses the ''Chemarea'' group as a Symbolist faction, borrowing freely from the avant-garde.&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p.4, 7, 170&lt;/ref&gt;

The war scattered and divided the various Symbolist milieus along the larger divide between the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] and [[Central Powers]] camps. A significant portion of the movement split with Francophilia, either by campaigning in favor of [[pacifism]] or by rallying with the Central Powers' cause. A notorious case was that of Bogdan-Pitești, by then host to a large circle of protégé writers or artists, who used his position and wealth to advance a [[Germanophile]] ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.94-95, 189-195, 203, 342; Cernat, p.34, 39-45&lt;/ref&gt; The old Macedonski, by then disappointed with France and the Francophiles, was also sympathetic to the German cause.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.103-104, 246-248; Vianu, Vol. II, p.381-384, 387&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the pro-Entente cause was enthusiastically supported by those Symbolists who still strongly identified with Francophilia: Minulescu, Densusianu, [[N. Davidescu]], [[Victor Eftimiu]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.61, 74, 78, 102-103, 113, 117, 235. See also: Vianu, Vol. II, p.384; Vol. III, p.131-132&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The situation became conflictual after the National Liberal cabinet rallied Romania with the Entente, opening Romania to a [[Romania during World War I|German-led invasion]] and having to take refuge in Iași. Several of the Symbolists and modernists in Bucharest were among those who either continued to support or did not actively reject the Central Powers' administration of Romania, leaving their adversaries in Iași to describe them as [[Collaborationism|collaborationists]]. After the [[armistice with Germany]] of 1918, this charge resulted in the arrest of several Symbolist figures, Arghezi, Bogdan-Pitești, Galaction and [[Dumitru Karnabatt]] among them.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.339-344; Cernat, p.39, 45, 54, 132, 139&lt;/ref&gt; Adrian Maniu&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.103-105; Cernat, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Luca Caragiale]]&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.103, 202-204&lt;/ref&gt; maintained links with the occupiers, but avoided prosecution. Cocea, who supported the Entente in the name of Francophile ideals, spent part of the war years in the [[Russian Empire]], where he was won over by [[far left]] ideas shortly before the [[October Revolution]], returning to his country a committed [[Communism|communist]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.30, 188&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interwar survivals===
The voice of Symbolism was preserved in the writings of some old affiliates who remained active on the literary scene, but also found new adherents.

The creation of [[Greater Romania]] brought late Symbolism into [[Bessarabia]], stimulating the [[Literature of Moldova|Bessarabian literary scene]]. A generation of Romanian-speaking Bessarabian poets embraced Symbolism, in some cases with influences from other forms of modern writing. Particularly relevant in this context, [[George Meniuc]] embraced Symbolist poetry before moving toward Romanian traditionalism.&lt;ref name="abarcadia"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alexandru Burlacu]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/Alexandru%20BURLACUm.htm "Poezia basarabeană: Arcadia în negativ (I)"], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/Alexandru%20BURLACUap.html "Arcadia în negativ (II)"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', March–April 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="itpoezia"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ion Țurcanu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/TURCANUiun6.html "Poezia basarabeană din interbelic"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Simuț]], [http://www.romlit.ro/george_meniuc "George Meniuc"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 15/2005&lt;/ref&gt; The proliferation of Bessarabian Symbolism, often alongside Expressionism, was encouraged by several literary magazines—a leading presence among them was ''[[Viața Basarabiei]]'', which officially claimed to be a neo-''Sămănătorist'' publication, followed by ''[[Bugeacul]]'', ''[[Poetul]]'' and ''[[Itinerar]]''.&lt;ref name="abarcadia"/&gt; The Symbolist school's representatives in that region were a diverse gathering.

Tauris]], Centre for Albanian Studies, London &amp; New York, 2005, p.104.  {{ISBN|1-84511-031-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In visual arts, Symbolism still had some interwar followers. ''[[Tinerimea Artistică]]'' survived nominally until 1947, but lost its significance even before 1920.&lt;ref name="mvipostaze"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juvara, p.79-80; Șotropa (2009), p.38&lt;/ref&gt; The voice of Symbolism was kept alive through a late arrival, sculptor [[Dimitrie Paciurea]]. His work in the 1920s comprised a series of Secession-inspired "[[Chimera (mythology)|Chimeras]]", which earned much critical attention.&lt;ref name="mcvisuri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pavel, p.88-89; Șotropa (2007), p.24, 27; (2009), ''passim''.

===Interwar returnees and ''Sburătorul''===
Various critics have discussed the presence of or even return to Symbolism within the avant-garde environment, despite its radicalization as Futurism, [[Dada]], [[Surrealism]] or [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]]. The neutrality years had witnessed a milestone in the history of avant-garde literature, with the activity of [[Urmuz]], an eccentric civil servant whose life ended in public suicide. Urmuz's [[Absurdism|absurdist]] prose, occasionally supported by the [[performance art]] of his actor friend [[George Ciprian]], fascinated the bohemian environment, but was only published with Arghezi's assistance in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.9, 48, 50, 91-92, 131, 156, 180, 181-197, 206, 222, 269, 271, 321-323, 329-335, 339-391, 394, 395, 397, 403, 404-405, 412, 415; Grigorescu, p.423-424; Sandqvist, p.19-22, 209, 218-237, 245, 248, 372, 375. See also Călinescu, p.888-890, 921&lt;/ref&gt; Following a parallel avant-garde trend, Tzara and Janco settled in neutral [[Switzerland]] during the war years, where they contributed to the very invention of Dada. Rallying from Romania with his former ''Simbolul'' colleagues, Vinea stated his affiliation with the radical trends, while remaining an eclectic and overall isolated figure. ''[[Contimporanul]]'', the magazine he founded with Janco upon the latter's return to Romania, moved between radical politics, eclectic Constructivism and praise for Arghezi's poetic synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.50-51, 53, 72, 75-81, 83, 116, 120-312, 403-404, 407-413; Grigorescu, p.385, 389, 391-394; Sandqvist, p.217, 345-370&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing at the time, both Vinea and [[Benjamin Fondane]] looked back critically on Romanian Symbolism, describing it as imitative, in whole or in part, of France's model, and as such detrimental to Romanian authenticity or spontaneity.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.208-209, 408&lt;/ref&gt; Their jargon notwithstanding, ''Contimporanul'' still published the work of authors who urged respect for Symbolism (most notably, the journalist Horia Verzeanu).&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p.196&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the successive avant-garde episodes, Vinea himself preserved a traceable link to Symbolism, which resurfaced in his works of poems and prose until the final years in his life&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.896-897; Cernat, p.75-81, 116-130, 148, 150-151, 180-186, 266-267, 308-311, 351-352, 398, 422; {{ro icon}} Gabriela Ursachi, [http://www.romlit.ro/iulie3 "Iulie"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 28/2004; Simona Vasilache, [http://www.romlit.ro/avangarda_napoi "Avangarda înapoi!"], in ''România Literară'', Nr. 19/2006&lt;/ref&gt; (according to one interpretation, the link with Symbolism was even preserved by Tzara himself, despite his international profile in Dada and Surrealism).&lt;ref&gt;Philip Beitchman, "Symbolism in the Streets", in ''I Am a Process with No Subject'', [[University Press of Florida|University of Florida Press]], Gainesville, 1988, p.27-52. {{ISBN|0-8130-0888-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving between Fondane's version of bucolic literature and a similar commitment to Surrealism, the younger Jewish poet [[Ilarie Voronca]] maintained links with Symbolist [[poetics]] throughout his career.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.38, 325.

Despite having been lampooned by ''[[Facla]]'', ''Insula'' and the other Symbolist circles,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.28, 63-65&lt;/ref&gt; literary theorist [[Eugen Lovinescu]] came to identify with the essence of Romanian modernism by the 1920s. Initially inspired by the ''Junimea'' guidelines and the critical tradition of his native Moldavia, he slowly adapted his style to [[Impressionism (literature)|Impressionist literature]], but for long remained skeptic of more ambitious modernist experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.799-808; Cernat, p.61, 63-65, 134-135, 297, 299, 304, 308, 310, 314-315, 319-320, 326, 348, 404, 411-412; Ornea, p.31, 37-38, 47, 67-68, 70, 124-125, 133, 139-147, 267-268, 377; Vianu, Vol. II, p.11, 314-316; Vol. III, p.98, 270-271, 315, 394, 403-404&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Lovinescu's ideology came to resemble Symbolism: there various point of contact between his main tribune, ''[[Sburătorul]]'', and the more nostalgic wing of post-Symbolism,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.63-64&lt;/ref&gt; and Lovinescu was for a while credited as a "Symbolist critic".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Marian Victor Buciu, [http://www.romlit.ro/cronicarul_antifoiletonistic "Cronicarul antifoiletonistic"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 39/2008; Gabriela Omăt, [http://www.romlit.ro/e._lovinescu_-_proze_uitate "E. Lovinescu - proze uitate"], in ''România Literară'', Nr. 33/2002&lt;/ref&gt; He was nevertheless still a censor of those Symbolists who had sided with the Central Powers during the wartime regimes.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.808; Cernat, p.39, 45. See also Boia, p.326, 364-365&lt;/ref&gt; This hostile attitude further irritated his various adversaries, who found it ironic that the former enemy of Symbolism had come to be perceived by the general public as the leading authority on modernism.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.64, 134, 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravitating between ''Sburătorul'' and ''Contimporanul'' were various new poets with eclectic tastes, who cultivated a poetry based on the aesthetics of mystery and formal purism. These "[[Hermeticism (poetry)|hermeticist]]" or "[[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]]" authors, having as their leading representatives [[Ion Barbu]] and the younger [[Dan Botta]], moved its international reference point back to the roots of Symbolism, with [[Edgar Allan Poe]].&lt;ref&gt;Balotă, p.48, 57-96, 104, 112, 172-184, 202, 279, 360; Călinescu, p.645, 750, 792, 840, 866, 867, 892-896, 901-907; Carlson, p.77, 78; Cernat, p.78, 81, 147-148, 152-153, 170, 238-239, 351-352, 402; Vianu, Vol. III, p.392-469&lt;/ref&gt; In varying degrees, this tendency was also illustrated by [[Radu Boureanu]], [[Barbu Brezianu]], [[Eugen Jebeleanu]], [[Simion Stolnicu]], [[Cicerone Theodorescu]] and [[Andrei Tudor]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.901-907; Cernat, p.153. According to Călinescu, the "Hermeticist" trend also marked periods in the careers of [[Emil Botta]], [[Virgil Gheorghiu (avant-garde poet)|Virgil Gheorghiu]], [[Emil Gulian]], [[Mircea Pavelescu]], [[Ion Pogan]], [[Alexandru Robot]], [[Horia Stamatu]], [[Vladimir Streinu]] and various members of the ''[[Iconar]]'' circle.&lt;/ref&gt; In Transylvania, another school of poets, presided over by [[Aron Cotruș]], cultivated a merger of modernist social protest and rural settings, but with distinct echoes from [[Russian Symbolism]],&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.841-842, 942-943; Grigorescu, p.411-413&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Radu Stanca]] experimented with Symbolism and Aestheticism before joining the [[Sibiu Literary Circle]].&lt;ref name="cuiubirip"&gt;{{ro icon}} Alexandru Ruja, [http://www.revistaorizont.ro/arhiva/iunie2009.pdf "I. Negoițescu — între exaltare și rațiune"], in ''[[Orizont]]'', Nr. 6/2009, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

===From censorship to Neosymbolism===
The 1920s and '30s witnessed a transition of various formerly Symbolist authors toward folkloric traditionalism. This was in particular the case of Maniu (who did not entirely abandon his modernist language, but fused it into a new style) and [[Ion Pillat]], both of whom gravitated around the neo-traditionalist publication ''[[Gândirea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.645-646, 805, 819, 824-826, 845, 866-868, 902, 932, 937, 938, 944; Cernat, p.19, 36-38, 51, 54, 72, 98, 109, 135-137, 143-145, 151-152, 184, 203-204, 208-210, 234-238, 308, 311-312, 398, 402, 408. See also: Balotă, p.97-124; Vianu, Vol. III, p.362-373&lt;/ref&gt; The group also comprised poet and future far-right politician [[Nichifor Crainic]], who blended Symbolism and [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilkean]] verse into radical traditionalism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irina Livezeanu]], "After the Great Union: Generational Tensions, Intellectuals, Modernism, and Ethnicity in Interwar Romania", in ''[http://www.nec.ro/fundatia/nec/publications/nation.pdf Nation and National Ideology.

Davidescu]]'s rejection of his own Symbolist roots, making him an advocate of didactic poetry and the author of nostalgic prose,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.698-699&lt;/ref&gt; came together with political radicalization. Like [[Nae Ionescu]] and Crainic, Davidescu became a far-right affiliate, and eventually a supporter of [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.137, 153&lt;/ref&gt; This evolution also touched his image of the past: Davidescu initially demanded the revival of Symbolism as a Neoclassical tendency (an ideal stated in his polemic with Fondane during the 1920s), and, in the process of editing a 1943 anthology of ''[[fin de siècle]]'' poetry, substituted the term "Symbolist" for "Parnassian".&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.12, 153, 171, 406&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolist aesthetics made an uncharacteristic comeback in official art under the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]], who commissioned works from [[Ivan Meštrović]], the [[Croatia|Croat]] master of Secession sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Erwin Kessler]], [http://www.revista22.ro/carol-calare-pe-mihai-nebunul-4539.html "Carol călare pe Mihai (Nebunul)"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 948, May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], the [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] regime of ''[[Conducător]]'' [[Ion Antonescu]] banned the Jewish Symbolists, alongside many other Jewish writers; this approach was notably resisted by George Călinescu, whose 1941 study of Romanian literature featured ample coverage of Jewish contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Liviu Rotman (ed.), ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110818231335/http://jewishfed.ro/fcer/public_html/downloads/carti/Demnitate.pdf Demnitate în vremuri de restriște]'', [[Editura Hasefer]], [[Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania]] &amp; [[Elie Wiesel National Institute for Studying the Holocaust in Romania]], Bucharest, 2008, p.174-177.  {{ISBN|978-973-630-189-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the first decades of [[Communist Romania|communist rule]], when the politically motivated art of [[Socialist realism in Romania|Socialist Realism]] monopolized the cultural scene, the legacy of Symbolism was stifled and its surviving representatives were among the prime targets of [[Censorship in Communist Romania|official censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, p.78-80; Cernat, p.129-130, 354-359.

The age of [[liberalization]], coinciding with the final Gheorghiu-Dej years and the rise of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], reversed the censorship trend: by the late 1960s, Symbolism had been largely recognized as part of Romania's literary and artistic heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, p.78-80&lt;/ref&gt; With the relaxation of censorship came a general revival of modernism, which included, in some cases, the adoption of [[Neosymbolism]].

A generation later, the ''[[Optzeciști]]'' writers, seeking escape from communist realities, took refuge in the bookish and imaginative universe. This opened several links with the Symbolist generations, and the more evident Neosymbolist aesthetics were deduced by critical opinion in lyrical works by the ''Optzeciști'' [[Mircea Cărtărescu]] and [[Traian T. Coșovei]].&lt;ref name="pcivanescu"/&gt; After the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], several new arrivals to literature embraced Neosymbolist aesthetics.

The '''Symphony No. 8''' (also called the '''''Antarctic'' Symphony''') is an orchestral composition by [[Peter Maxwell Davies]], completed on 15 December 2001.

==History==
Davies had announced prior to its premiere that his [[Symphony No. 7 (Davies)|Seventh Symphony]] was to be his last work in the form {{harv|Service|2000}}. Less than six months later, Davies amended his statement to say that it was only the last of a seven-symphony ''cycle'': "No. 8, next year, will be a musical account of my visit to Antarctica, with very different aims and preoccupations" {{harv|Davies|[2000]}}. Advance publicity for the Eighth proved to be more than that for the other seven symphonies put together {{harv|Anon.|2001}}.

[[File:RRS James Clark Ross Rothera.jpg|thumb|left|Davies sailed from the Falklands to Antarctica on RSS James Clark Ross, shown here in port at Rothera Station]]
Three years earlier the [[British Antarctic Survey]], which was seeking to promote the region's significance, had asked the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]] to recommend a composer for the commission of an orchestral work intended to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]'s score for the 1948 film [[Scott of the Antarctic (film)|''Scott of the Antarctic'']] and the [[Symphony No. 7 (Vaughan Williams)|Seventh Symphony]] (''Sinfonia antartica'') which he fashioned out of that film score. Davies, as a committed environmentalist, was chosen. Terms of the commission required the composer to visit Antarctica, which he did for three weeks from late December 1997 to January 1998 ({{harvnb|Alberge|2001}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|2001}}; {{harvnb|Conway|2001}}; {{harvnb|Witts|2001|loc=8}}). The composer published his diary of the trip as an illustrated book, ''Notes from a Cold Climate'' {{harv|Davies|2001b}}. The composer also revealed that the symphony reflects his experience of having heard Vaughan Williams's Seventh at its first performance in Manchester in 1953 ({{harvnb|Alberge|2001}}; {{harvnb|Conway|2001}}). In the end, Davies decided that his new work would also be a symphony.

Davies conducted the Philharmonia Orchestra in the premiere of his ''Antarctic'' Symphony at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London, on 6 May 2001 {{harv|Uppenbrink|2001}}. At this time, Davies once more announced that this would be absolutely his last symphony ({{harvnb|Anon.|2001}}; {{harvnb|Witts|2001|loc=8}}). This time it would take him ten years to change his mind.

==Character and materials==
[[File:Kg hut new view.jpg|thumb|View from Fossil Bluff Main Hut (BAS), which Davies visited in 1997–98]]
Davies said he was "greatly influenced by my encounter with scientists searching into ways in which the Antarctic will change our environment over the coming centuries" {{harv|Alberge|2001}}. The sounds of two particular events in his polar journey were incorporated directly into the symphony. The BAS had flown the composer to the [[Falkland Islands|Falklands]], but from there onward it was a sea voyage. In his journal, Davies described hearing "the ice crack and split before the bow, then roar along, keel to stern, in a tumultuous clatter of slabs and shards", and this sound is represented at the beginning of the symphony through the percussive use of a biscuit tin filled with broken glass, a tam-tam with plastic soapdish, and three lengths of builders' scaffolding. The second sound was of an avalanche as the ship passed through a narrow channel between ice mountains. The composer described the sound that suddenly enveloped the ship as "the mightiest, gentlest, longest whisper ever. It was a sound which seemed almost quieter than the silence which surrounded it" {{harv|Finch and Davies|2001}}. These two sounds, of an ice-break and an avalanche, suggested using a [[Pentecost]] [[plainsong]] associated with the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles, which Davies had used before: "Dum complerentur dies pentecostes erant omnes pariter dicentes: Alleluia. Et subito factus est sonus de coelo … Tamquam spiritus vehementis" (And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place saying: Alleluia. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven … as of a mighty rushing wind) {{harv|Davies|[2001a]}}.

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, double bassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, five percussionists (xylophone with Japanese temple gong and 2 cymbals, glockenspiel, marimba, crotales, tubular bells, bell-tree, very small high wood-block, Chinese cymbals, clashed cymbals, 4 suspended cymbals (very small, small, medium, large), nipple gong, tam-tam (with plastic soap-dish), tuned brandy glasses (with water), 2 small pebbles, football rattle, biscuit tin (filled with broken glass), 3 lengths of metal builder's scaffolding (5 inches or 18 cm, 12 inches or 30 cm, 16 inches or 40 cm) to be hit by a mallet), harp, celeste, strings

==Analysis==
The symphony is in a single movement divided into five sections, reflecting the five movements of Vaughan Williams's Seventh {{harv|Witts|2001|loc=11}}. It is constructed symmetrically around a central scherzo, preceded and followed by slow sections, and faster music at the beginning and end {{harv|Anon.|2001}}. A brief introduction is followed by an allegro [[Exposition (music)|exposition]] featuring sharply contrasting dynamics. The first slow section begins with a simple clarinet melody accompanied by pizzicato cellos. Material from the introduction is then developed in a faster tempo, leading into the central scherzo which recalls Davies's ''An Orkney Wedding with Sunrise''. This ends with an episode describing the litter left behind by early Antarctic expeditions, represented here by quotations from Davies's own recent works, followed by the second slow section, with glittering icy sounds overlaying earlier material. The final fast section transforms the ideas from the exposition, representing the changing shape of partially thawing icebergs in midsummer, and a slower [[Coda (music)|coda]] brings back elements from the introduction ({{harvnb|Conway|2001}}; {{harvnb|Davies|[2001a]}}).

The '''Tel Dan Stele''' is a broken [[stele]] (inscribed stone) discovered in 1993–94 during excavations at [[Tel Dan]] in northern [[Israel]]. It consists of several fragments making up part of a triumphal inscription in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], left most probably by [[Hazael]] of [[Aram-Damascus]], an important regional figure in the late 9th&amp;nbsp;century BCE. Hazael (or more accurately, the unnamed king) boasts of his victories over the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|king of Israel]] and his ally the king of the [[Davidic line|"House of David]]" (''[[bet (letter)|b]][[yodh|y]][[tav (letter)|t]][[dalet|d]][[waw (letter)|w]][[dalet|d]]''). It is considered the earliest widely accepted reference to the name David as the founder of a [[Kingdom of Judah|Judahite]] polity outside of the [[Hebrew Bible]],{{sfn|Finkelstein|2007|p=14}} though the earlier [[Mesha Stele]] contains several possible references with varying acceptance. A minority of scholars have disputed the reference to David, due to the lack of a [[word divider]] between ''byt'' and ''dwd'', and other translations have been proposed. The stele was not excavated in its [[Archaeological context|primary context]], but in its secondary use.&lt;ref name=Demsky/&gt; The Tel Dan stele is one of four known inscriptions made during a roughly 400-year period (1200-800 BCE) containing the name "Israel", the others being the [[Merneptah Stele]], the [[Mesha Stele]], and the [[Kurkh Monolith]].{{sfn|Lemche|1998|pp=46, 62|ps=: “ No other inscription from Palestine, or from Transjordan in the Iron Age, has so far provided any specific reference to Israel... The name of Israel was found in only a very limited number of inscriptions, one from Egypt, another separated by at least 250 years from the first, in Transjordan. A third reference is found in the stele from Tel Dan - if it is genuine, a question not yet settled. The Assyrian and Mesopotamian sources only once mentioned a king of Israel, Ahab, in a spurious rendering of the name.”}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maeir|first=Aren|year=|title=Maeir, A. M. 2013.

Thereafter, no reference to either Judah or Israel appears until the ninth century. The pharaoh Sheshonq I (biblical Shishak; see SHESHONQ I–VI) mentions neither entity by name in the inscription recording his campaign in the southern Levant during the late tenth century. In the ninth century, Israelite kings, and possibly a Judaean king, are mentioned in several sources: the Aramaean stele from Tel Dan, inscriptions of SHALMANESER III of Assyria, and the stela of Mesha of Moab. From the early eighth century onward, the kingdoms of Israel and Judah are both mentioned somewhat regularly in Assyrian and subsequently Babylonian sources, and from this point on there is relatively good agreement between the biblical accounts on the one hand and the archaeological evidence and extra-biblical texts on the other.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=FLEMING|first=DANIEL E.|date=1998-01-01|year=|title=MARI AND THE POSSIBILITIES OF BIBLICAL MEMORY|jstor=23282083|journal=Revue d'Assyriologie et d'archéologie orientale|volume=92|issue=1|pages=41–78|quote=The Assyrian royal annals, along with the Mesha and Dan inscriptions, show a thriving northern state called Israël in the mid—9th century, and the continuity of settlement back to the early Iron Age suggests that the establishment of a sedentary identity should be associated with this population, whatever their origin.

The Tel Dan inscription generated considerable debate and a flurry of articles, debating its age, authorship, and authenticity;{{sfn|Lemche|1998|p=41|ps=: “The inscription is kept in a kind of “pidgin” Aramaic, sometimes looking more like a kind of mixed language in which Aramaic and Phoenician linguistic elements are jumbled together, in its phraseology nevertheless closely resembling especially the [[Mesha Stele|Mesha inscription]] and the Aramaic [[Stele of Zakkur|Zakkur inscription]] from Aphis near Aleppo. The narrow links between the Tel Dan inscription and these two inscriptions are of a kind that has persuaded at least one major specialist into believing that the inscription is a forgery. This cannot be left out of consideration in advance, because some of the circumstances surrounding its discovery may speak against its being genuine. Other examples of forgeries of this kind are well known, and clever forgers have cheated even respectable scholars into accepting something that is obviously false.”}} however, the stele is generally accepted by scholars as genuine and a reference to the [[Davidic line|House of David]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kcVmBAEo5rcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA333|title=Ahab Agonistes: The Rise and Fall of the Omri Dynasty|last=Grabbe|first=Lester L.|date=2007-04-28|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|year=|isbn=9780567251718|location=|pages=|language=en|quote=The Tel Dan inscription generated a good deal of debate and a flurry of articles when it first appeared, but it is now widely regarded (a) as genuine and (b) as referring to the Davidic dynasty and the Aramaic kingdom of Damascus.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uGzRCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA61|title=Biblical Archaeology: A Very Short Introduction|last=Cline|first=Eric H.|date=2009-09-28|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780199711628|location=|pages=|language=en|quote=Today, after much further discussion in academic journals, it is accepted by most archaeologists that the inscription is not only genuine but that the reference is indeed to the House of David, thus representing the first allusion found anywhere outside the Bible to the biblical David.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eprY1Qd0veAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA113|title=Identifying Biblical Persons in Northwest Semitic Inscriptions of 1200-539 B.C.E.|last=Mykytiuk|first=Lawrence J.|date=2004-01-01|publisher=Society of Biblical Lit|year=|isbn=9781589830622|location=|pages=|language=en|quote=Some unfounded accusations of forgery have had little or no effect on the scholarly acceptance of this inscription as genuine.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently on display in the [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.imjnet.org.il/HTMLs/page_819.aspx?c0=14322&amp;bsp=14162|title=Samuel and Saidye Bronfman Archaeology Wing|accessdate=26 August 2011|publisher=The Israel Museum, Jerusalem|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812131801/http://www.english.imjnet.org.il/htmls/page_819.aspx?c0=14322&amp;bsp=14162|archivedate=12 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and description==

===Discovery===
Fragment A of the stele was discovered in July 1993 by [[Gila Cook]] of the team of [[Avraham Biran]] studying [[Tel Dan]] in the northern part of modern Israel. Fragments B1 and B2 were found in June 1994.{{sfn|Brooks|2005|p=2}} The stele was not excavated in its "[[Archaeological context|primary context]]", but in its "secondary use".&lt;ref name=Demsky&gt;Aaron Demsky (2007), [https://www.academia.edu/7692617/Reading_Northwest_Semitic_Inscriptions Reading Northwest Semitic Inscriptions], Near Eastern Archaeology 70/2. Quote: "The first thing to consider when examining an ancient inscription is whether it was discovered in context or not. It is obvious that a document purchased on the antiquities market is suspect. If it was found in an archeological site, one should note whether it was found in its primary context, as with the [[Ekron inscription|inscription of King Achish from Ekron]], or in secondary use, as with the Tel Dan inscription. Of course texts that were found in an archaeological site, but not in a secure archaeological context present certain problems of exact dating, as with the Gezer Calendar."&lt;/ref&gt;

The fragments were published by Biran and his colleague Joseph Naveh in 1993 and 1995.{{sfn|Brooks|2005|p=2}}

===Content===
In the second half of the 9th century BCE (the most widely accepted date for the stele) the kingdom of [[Aram Damascus|Aram]], under its ruler [[Hazael]], was a major power in the [[Levant]]. [[Tribe of Dan|Dan]], just 70 miles from Hazael's capital of Damascus, would almost certainly have come under its sway. This is borne out by the archaeological evidence: [[Israelites|Israelite]] remains do not appear until the 8th century BCE, and it appears that Dan was already in the orbit of Damascus even before Hazael became king in c. 843 BCE.{{sfn|Athas|2003|pp=255–257}}

The author of the inscription mentions conflict with the kings of Israel and the 'House of David'. The names of the two enemy kings are only partially legible. Biran and Naveh reconstructed them as [[Jehoram of Israel|Joram, son of Ahab]], King of Israel, and [[Ahaziah of Judah|Ahaziah, son of Joram]] of the House of David. Scholars seem to be evenly divided on these identifications.{{sfn|Hagelia|2005|p=235}} It is dependent on a particular arrangement of the fragments, and not all scholars agree on this.

In the reconstructed text, the author tells how Israel had invaded his country in his father's day, and how the god [[Hadad]] then made him king and marched with him against Israel. The author then reports that he defeated seventy kings with thousands of chariots and horses. In the very last line there is a suggestion of a siege, possibly of [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]], the capital of the kings of Israel.{{sfn|Hagelia|2005|p=235}} This reading is, however, disputed.{{sfn|Athas|2003|pp=259–308}}

==Interpretation and disputes==

===Configuration===
The stele was found in three fragments, called A, B1 and B2. There is widespread agreement that all three belong to the same inscription, and that B1 and B2 belong together. There is less agreement over the fit between A and the combined B1/B2: Biran and Naveh placed B1/B2 to the left of A (the photograph at the top of this article). A few scholars have disputed this, [[William Schniedewind]] proposing some minor adjustments to the same fit, [[Gershon Galil]] placing B above A rather than beside it, and George Athas fitting it well below.{{sfn|Hagelia|2005|pp=232–233}}

===Dating ===
Archeologists and [[epigrapher]]s{{which|date=September 2016}} put the earliest possible date at about 870 BCE, whilst the latest possible date is "less clear", although according to Lawrence J. Mykytiuk it could "hardly have been much later than 750".{{sfn|Mykytiuk|2004|pp=115, 117fn.52}} However, some scholars (mainly associated with the [[Copenhagen School (theology)|Copenhagen school]]) – Niels Peter Lemche, [[Thomas L. Thompson]], and F. H. Cryer – have proposed still later datings.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cracks and inscription===
Bible scholars Cryer and [[Niels Peter Lemche|Lemche]] analyzed the cracks and chisel marks around the fragment, and the lettering towards the edges of the fragments. They noted that if their observations were correct, the stele would most likely have been a modern forgery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bWavAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61 House of David], Lemche, 2004, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most scholars consider the inscription authentic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Authorship===
The language of the inscription is a dialect of [[Aramaic]].{{sfn|Mykytiuk|2004|pp=115,117fn.52}} Most scholars identify [[Hazael]] of Damascus (c. 842 – 806 BCE) as the author, although his name is not mentioned. Other proposals regarding the author have been made: George Athas argues for Hazael's son  [[Ben-Hadad III]], which would date the inscription to around 796 BCE, and J-W Wesselius has argued for [[Jehu]] of Israel (reigned c. 845 – 818 BCE).

==="House of David"===
{{See also|Davidic line}}
	
Since 1993–1994, when the first fragment was discovered and published, the Tel Dan stele has been the object of great interest and debate among epigraphers and [[Biblical studies|biblical scholars]] along the whole range of views from those who find little of historical value in the biblical version of Israel's ancient past to those who are unconcerned about the biblical version, to those who wish to defend it.

Its significance for the biblical version of Israel's past lies particularly in lines 8 and 9, which mention a "king of Israel" and a "house of David". The latter is generally understood by scholars to refer to the ruling dynasty of Judah. However, although the "king of Israel" is generally accepted, the rendering of the phrase ''bytdwd'' as "house of David" has been disputed by some. This dispute is occasioned in part because it appears without a word divider between the two parts.{{sfn|Stavrakopoulou|2004|pp=86–87}} The significance of this fact, if any, is unclear, because others, such as the late [[Anson Rainey|Anson F. Rainey]], have observed that the presence or absence of word-dividers (for example, sometimes a short vertical line between words, other times a dot between words, as in this inscription) is normally inconsequential for interpretation.{{sfn|Rainey|1994|p=47}}

The majority of scholars argue that the author simply thought of "House of David" as a single word – but some have argued that "dwd" (the usual spelling for "David") could be a name for a god ("beloved"), or could be "dōd", meaning "uncle" (a word with a rather wider meaning in ancient times than it has today), or, as George Athas has argued, that the whole phrase might be a name for Jerusalem (so that the author might be claiming to have killed the son of the king of Jerusalem rather than the son of the king from the "house of David".{{sfn|Lemche|1998|p=43}}{{sfn|Athas|2003|pp=225–226}}

Other possible meanings have been suggested: it may be a place-name, or the name of a god, or an epithet.{{sfn|Stavrakopoulou|2004|pp=86–87}} Mykytiuk observes that "dwd" meaning "kettle" (dūd) or "uncle" (dōd) do not fit the context. He also weighs the interpretive options that the term ''bytdwd'' might refer to the name of a god, [[Cult image|cultic object]], epithet or a place and concludes that these possibilities have no firm basis. Rather, he finds that the preponderance of the evidence points to the ancient Aramaic and Assyrian word-patterns for geopolitical terms. According to the pattern used, the phrase "House of David" refers to a Davidic dynasty or to the land ruled by a Davidic dynasty.{{sfn|Mykytiuk|2004|pp=121–128}} As an alternative, [[Francesca Stavrakopoulou]] remains sceptical about the significance and interpretation of the inscription and claims that it does not necessarily support the assumption that the Bible's David was a historical figure since "David" which can also be translated as "beloved" could refer to a mythical ancestor.{{sfn|Stavrakopoulou|2004|pp=86–87}} In Schmidt's view it is indeed likely{{sfn|Schmidt|2006|p=315}} that the correct translation is "House of David."

'''Teresa Elizabeth Furtado'''  (1845 – 9 August 1877) was a well-known actress at London's  [[Adelphi Theatre]] where she played leading [[melodrama]]tic roles for nine seasons.

She was the daughter of Charles Furtado, professor of music in London and composer of ballads. Her appearances at the Adelphi included ''No Thoroughfare'' by [[Wilkie Collins]] and [[Charles Dickens]] (1868) and Esmeralda in ''Notre-Dame or, The Gipsy Girl of Paris'', a dramatized version of [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1875). She also appeared in the premieres of two early works by [[W.S. Gilbert]] – as Pocahontas in his 1867 [[burlesque]], ''Robinson Crusoe'' at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] and as Jenny Wren in his 1867 [[pantomime]], ''[[Harlequin Cock Robin and Jenny Wren]]'' at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Stedman (1996) p. 40 and p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873 she married the English actor, John Clarke. Her premature death at the age of 32 led to his breakdown and he died less than two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen (1888) p. 435&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Rape of Proserpina''''' ({{lang-it|Ratto di Proserpina}}) is a large [[Baroque sculpture|Baroque]] [[marble]] sculptural group by Italian artist [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], executed between 1621 and 1622. Bernini was only twenty-three years old at its completion. It depicts the [[Persephone#Abduction myth|Abduction of Proserpina]], where [[Proserpina]] is seized and taken to the underworld by the god [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]].&lt;ref&gt;Avery 1997, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wittkower 1955, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rape of Prosepina September 2015-2b.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Detail of the sculpture]]

==Patronage==
As with many of Bernini's early works, it was commissioned by Cardinal [[Scipione Borghese]], possibly alongside a portrait of Scipione's uncle [[Pope Paul V]] (who had died in 1621). Bernini received at least three payments for the statue, of value of at least 450 [[Roman scudo|Roman scudi]]. The sculpture was begun in 1621 and completed in 1622. Quite soon after completion, the statue was given by Scipione to [[Ludovico Ludovisi|Cardinal Ludovisi]] in 1622, who transported it to [[Villa Ludovisi|his villa]]. Purchased by the Italian State, it returned to the Villa Borghese in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Wittkower 1955, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reaction==
Most critics have also been quick to praise the work. Rudolf Wittkower noted that "representations of such rape scenes depended on Bernini's new, dynamic conception for the next hundred and fifty years".&lt;ref&gt;Wittkower 1955, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Howard Hibbard makes similar comments noting the realistic effects that Bernini had achieved via the carving hard marble—such as the "texture of the skin, the flying ropes of hair, the tears of Persephone and above all the yielding flesh of the girl".&lt;ref&gt;Hibbard 1990, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of incident to depict the story is commonly cited as well—Pluto's hands encircle the waist of Proserpina just as she throws her arms out in an attempt to escape.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbard 1990, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Bernini's own son and biographer, Domenico, called it "an amazing contrast of tenderness and cruelty".&lt;ref&gt;Bernini 2011, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when Bernini's reputation was at a low ebb, critics found fault with the statue. The eighteenth-century French visitor Jerome de la Lande allegedly wrote that "Pluto's back is broken; his figure extravagant, without character, nobleness of expression, and its outline bad; the female one no better".&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2010, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Another French visitor to the Villa Ludovisi was equally critical, stating, "The head of Pluto is vulgarly gay; his crown and beard give him a ridiculous air, while the muscles are strongly marked and the figure poses. It is not a true divinity, but a decorative god..."&lt;ref&gt;Taine, 1871, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have remarked on the twisted [[contrapposto]] or [[figura serpentinata]] pose of the group. While reminiscent of [[Mannerism]], particularly [[Giambologna]]'s ''[[The Rape of the Sabine Women]]'', Bernini permits the viewer to absorb the scene from one single viewpoint. While other views provide further details, a spectator can see the desperation of Persephone and the lumbering attempts of Pluto to grab her. This was in contrast to the Mannerist sculpture of Giambologna, which required the spectator to walk around the sculpture to gain a view of each of character's expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbard 1990, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smarth"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bernini's Pluto and Proserpina |work=Smart History |date= |url=http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/pluto-and-proserpina.html |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Toy Symphony''' (full title: ''[[Cassation (music)|Cassation]] in G major for toys, 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[Horn (instrument)|horns]], [[string section|strings]] and [[Figured bass|continuo]]'') is a musical work with parts for toy instruments.

It was long reputed to be the work of [[Joseph Haydn]],&lt;ref&gt;p. 201, Ewen (1965) David. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey ''The Complete Book of Classical Music'' Prentice-Hall&lt;/ref&gt; but later scholarship suggested that it was actually written by [[Leopold Mozart]].&lt;ref name="allmusic"&gt;{{cite web|author=Description by Uncle Dave Lewis |url=http://www.allmusic.com/composition/toy-symphony-cassation-for-toys-2-oboes-2-horns-strings-in-g-major-formerly-k-63-mc0002374551 |title=Toy Symphony (Cassation), for toys, 2 oboes, 2 horns &amp; strings in G major (formerly K. 63) – Leopold Mozart &amp;#124; Details, Parts / Movements and Recordings |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its authorship is still disputed, however, and other composers have been proposed as the symphony's true author, including Joseph Haydn's younger brother [[Michael Haydn]], who purportedly contributed movements to the work.&lt;ref name=benstock&gt;{{cite book |last=Benstock, |first=Seymour |date=June 14, 2013 |title=Did You Know?: A Music Lover's Guide to Nicknames, Titles, and Whimsy |url= |location=USA |publisher=Trafford Publishing  |page=194 |isbn=9781466972926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research on a newly found manuscript suggests the Austrian [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monk Edmund Angerer (1740–1794) to be the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musikland-tirol.at/printable/kindersinfonie.php|title=15.

There is reason to believe that the true composer will likely never be known, in whole or in part, given its confused origins and the paucity of related manuscript sources.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7809">A '''tronie''' (16/17th-century [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for "face") is a common type, or group of types, of works common in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting]] that shows an exaggerated [[facial expression]] or a [[stock character]] in costume.

==Definition==
[[File:Joos van Craesbeeck - The Smoker.jpg|thumb|right|270px|upright|[[Joos van Craesbeeck]]'s ''The Smoker'', an example of a "tronie"]]
The term 'tronie' is not clearly defined in art historical literature. Literary and archival sources show that initially the term 'tronie' was not always associated with people. Inventories sometimes referred to flower and fruit still lifes as 'tronies'.  More common was the meaning of face or visage. Often the term referred to the entire head, even a bust, and in exceptional cases the whole body. A tronie could be two-dimensional, but also made of plaster or stone. Sometimes a tronie was a likeness, the depiction of an individual, including the face of God, Christ, Mary, a saint or an angel.  In particular a tronie denoted the characteristic appearance of the head of a type, for example a farmer, a beggar or a jester. Tronie sometimes meant so much as a grotesque head or a model such as the type of an ugly old person.  When conceived as the face of an individual and of a type a tronie's aim was to express feelings and character in an accurate manner and must therefore be expressive.&lt;ref name=tronie&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_zev001200101_01/_zev001200101_01_0017.php Jan Muylle, ''Tronies toegeschreven aan Pieter Bruegel''], in: De zeventiende eeuw. Jaargang 17. Uitgeverij Verloren, Hilversum 2001, p. 174-203 {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern art-historical usage the term tronie is typically restricted to figures not intended to depict an identifiable person, so it is a form of [[genre painting]] in a portrait format.  Typically a painted head or bust only, if concentrating on the facial expression, but often half-length when featured in an exotic costume, tronies might be based on studies from life or use the features of actual sitters.  The picture was typically sold on the art market without identification of the sitter, and was not commissioned and retained by the sitter as [[portrait]]s normally were.  Similar unidentified figures treated as [[history painting]]s would normally be given a title from the classical world, for example the Rembrandt painting now known as ''Saskia as Flora''.

==History==
The genre started in the Low Countries in the 16th century where it was likely inspired by some of the grotesque heads drawn by Leonardo.  Leonardo had pioneered drawings of paired grotesque heads whereby two heads, usually in profile, were placed opposite each other in order to accentuate their diversity.  This paired juxtaposition was also adopted by artists in the Low Countries.  In 1564 or 1565 Joannes and Lucas van Doetecum are believed to have engraved 72 heads attributed to [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] that followed this paired arrangement.&lt;ref name=tronie/&gt;

This paired model was still being used by some artists in the 17th century.  For instance, the Flemish artist [[Jan van de Venne]] who was active in the first half of the 17th century painted a number of tronies juxtaposing different faces.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Several [[Rembrandt]] [[self-portrait]] [[etching]]s are tronies, as are paintings of himself, his son and his wives. &lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;This is true of modern art-historical terminology; however, historical usage is not so precise. Seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish inventories of paintings might use the term for any unidentified sitter.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;  Three [[Vermeer]] paintings were described as "tronies" in the [[Jacob Dissius|Dissius]] auction of 1696, perhaps including the ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' and the Washington ''[[:File:Johannes Vermeer - Young Girl with a Flute - WGA24683.jpg|Young Girl with a flute]]''.  [[Frans Hals]] also painted a number of tronies, which are now among his best-known works, including the two tronies known as ''[[Malle Babbe]]'' and the ''[[The Gypsy Girl - Malle Babbe|Gypsy Girl]]'' (see gallery).

[[Adriaen Brouwer]] was one of the most successful practitioners of the genre as he had a talent for expressiveness. His work gave a face to lower-class figures by infusing their images with recognizable and vividly expressed human emotions—anger, joy, pain, and pleasure.   His ''Youth Making a Face'' (c. 1632/1635, [[National Gallery of Art]]) shows a young man with a satirical and mocking gesture which humanises him, however uninviting he may appear. Brouwer's vigorous application of paint in this composition, with his characteristically short, unmodulated brushstrokes, increases the dramatic effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.86204.html Brouwer, Adriaen, ''Youth Making a Face''] at the [[National Gallery of Art]]&lt;/ref&gt;   Genre painters often returned to the old theme of the allegory of the five senses and created series of tronies depicting the five senses. Examples are  [[Lucas Franchoys the Younger]]'s ''A man removing a plaster, the sense of touch'' and [[Joos van Craesbeeck]]'s ''The Smoker'' which represents taste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.wellcomelibrary.org/record=b1202823 ''A man removing a plaster, the sense of touch'' by [[Lucas Franchoys the Younger]]] at the [[Wellcome Library]], London&lt;/ref&gt;

The tronie is related to, and has some overlap with, the "portrait historié", a portrait of a real person '''as''' another, usually historical or [[mythological]], figure. [[Jan de Bray]] specialised in these, and many portraitists sometimes showed aristocratic ladies in particular as mythological figures.

The '''Unknown Confederate Soldier Monument in Horse Cave''' is a monument between [[Horse Cave, Kentucky]] and [[Kentucky Down Under]], off the main road between Horse Cave and [[Interstate 65 in Kentucky|I-65]] on the Old Dixie Highway, in [[Hart County, Kentucky]]. Among the various monuments of the [[List of Civil War Monuments of Kentucky|Civil War Monuments of Kentucky Multiple Property Submission]], all of which became part of the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on July 17, 1997, it is an oddity for several reasons. First, though meant to imply an [[obelisk]], it was constructed of local materials by a single individual. It was built during the [[Great Depression]] in year 1934, long after most monuments to the [[American Civil War]]. Instead of the typical [[limestone]] and [[marble]] from which most monuments were made, the monument uses [[geode]]s from [[Tennessee]], a [[Sedimentary rocks|sedimentary]]/[[volcanic]] rocks in which crystals fill a largely hollow interior. The monument is 12&amp;nbsp;feet high, with a base of five feet square.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.scrtc.com/~ftcraig/unknown.htm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208033946/http://www.scrtc.com/~ftcraig/unknown.htm |date=February 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trailsrus.com/monuments/reg3/horse_cave.html Civil War in Kentucky]&lt;/ref&gt;

The monument honors an unknown foot soldier from the 11th Louisiana Infantry, who died prior to the [[Battle of Munfordville]]. He was part of a tree-cutting detail. Ordered to rest, he lay down beside a tree. His loaded rifle accidentally discharged when it struck a tree branch; the bullet entered his head below his chin and killed him instantly. The soldier was buried with rocks marking his head and feet. Years later, a wire fence was placed around the grave.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Local tradition says that a man named Sam Lively built the monument, fearing otherwise the grave would become lost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history-sites.com/mb/cw/kycwmb/index.cgi?noframes;read=594 Re: Munfordville KY Civil War sites]&lt;/ref&gt;

The monument is technically on private property, but a path through the evergreen trees allows visitors access. A [[Confederate Naval Jack]] flies beside the monument.

The Inscription says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Unknown Soldier C. S. A. was a member of Gen. Clay Anderson division 11th Louisiana Killed September 9, 1862. Erected 1934 by Sam Lively.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''War'' and ''Peace''''' ({{lang-pt|Guerra e Paz}}) are two paintings made by [[Brazil]]ian [[Painting|painter]] [[Candido Portinari]] between 1952 and 1956. They are about {{Convert|14.32|m|ft}} tall and {{Convert|10.66|m|ft}} large each. They were painted for the [[United Nations Headquarters]] as a gift from the Brazilian government.

Viewing Cândido Portinari’s ''War'' and ''Peace'' assists in the understanding of war, regardless of the time period. It does not feature any weapons, but instead features the suffering of victims from war, which illustrates the barbarity of combat. The contrast between the elements of chaos and harmony show the importance of maintaining peace and the attempts to end violent conflicts. Though painted in the 1950s, they were, and still are a representation of the worldwide struggle for peace. The whole set of paintings work together as a representation of the atrocity of war and the importance of peace in the world.

''War'' and ''Peace'' were re-inaugurated in the United Nations Headquarters on September 8, 2015. The murals were celebrated by several guests, among whom were several heads of states, iconic artists, and the UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]]. During this event people shared a moment of silence in order to honour Portinari and his contributions. Overall, the murals were acknowledged as a symbol of obtaining and working towards worldwide peace.

Portinari reportedly sacrificed his own health for the murals, as during the long term process of creating the artworks Portinari became increasingly sick because of the paint he used. Doctors had warned him about being intoxicated due to inhalation, which would cause a decline in his health. Despite this, Portinari was dedicated to finishing his masterpieces, through which he hoped to send an important message to the world. He was able to complete the timeless murals, though, this cost him his health: he died on February 6, 1962 due to lead intoxication.

Portinari was banned from entering the US to inaugurate the panels, accused of being communist.

Nevertheless, Portinari remains eternal through his numerous paintings, including the murals of ''War'' and ''Peace''. As UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon stated during the re-installation, "Portinari is no longer alive, but his legacy will live forever at the United Nations. Let us realize his vision and move from war to peace."

==Physical History==

Once the completed set of paintings were received in 1956 by the UN headquarters in New York City, they were placed behind glass frames in order to help prevent damage from the public. However, the panels were still exposed to sunlight, and during the intervening 54 years, that exposure took its toll on the masterpieces. In 2010, the UN sent the works to Rio de Janeiro for restoration. After going through a long restoration process, the paintings were displayed to the public in Brazil and France, before being sent back to New York in December 2014. The murals remained covered until the re-inauguration on September 8, 2015.

During the re-inauguration Ban Ki-moon also stated, "''War'' and ''Peace'' are more than magnificent works of art. They are Portinari’s call to action. Thanks to him, all leaders who enter the United Nations see the terrible toll of war and the universal dream for peace."
