In January 2017, a [[Mental disorder#Disability|mentally disabled]] youth in a suburb of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], was filmed being physically and verbally abused by four individuals. The incident was [[livestream]]ed on [[Facebook]], making the incident a [[Live streaming crimes|live streaming crime]].

The victim met with an acquaintance from high school at a [[McDonald's]] on New Year's Eve, and on January 3 was found by a police officer to appear injured while walking with a suspect on a sidewalk. The four suspects were arrested after the incident was [[livestream]]ed by one of the women on [[Facebook Live|Facebook]], and charged with [[Hate crime laws in the United States|hate crime]]s and other offenses.

==Kidnapping and torture==
On December 31, 2016, the 18-year-old victim was dropped off at a [[McDonald's]] in suburban [[Streamwood, Illinois]], by his parents. The victim knew one of the suspects before the incident had occurred as the two had attended the same school in [[Aurora, Illinois]], and the victim had mistakenly thought that the two were friends. When the victim went to the McDonald's, he had the intention of spending time with this friend. On January 2, 2017, the victim's parents filed a report that he was missing.&lt;ref name = "Chicago Tribune, January 5, 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Meisner | first=Jason | last2=Lee | first2=William | last3=Schmadeke | first3=Steve | title=Brutal Facebook Live attack brings hate-crime charges, condemnation from White House | website=chicagotribune.com | date=2017-01-05 | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-facebook-live-attack-video-20170105-story.html | accessdate=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police noted that one of the male suspects stole a van and, pretending that it was his own van, went to meet the victim. The victim got into the van with the suspect, and they went to one of the suspect's friend's houses on the [[West Side, Chicago|West Side of Chicago]] for a two-day visit. During that time, the victim slept in the van.&lt;ref name = "Chicago Tribune, January 5, 2017"/&gt; On January 3, they went to the residence of two of the other suspects, who were sisters. While at the sisters' apartment, the victim and the male suspect "play-fought", which ended in the sisters getting angry and tying the victim up.&lt;ref name = "Chicago Tribune, January 5, 2017"/&gt;

The younger of the two sisters then turned on a Facebook Live stream to record the following events. The victim was bound, gagged, beaten, taunted, had part of his scalp removed with a knife, and was forced to kiss the floor and drink from a toilet bowl.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38525549 Four charged with hate crime for Chicago Facebook Live attack], BBC, January 5, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Domonoske 2017"/&gt; The attackers are heard shouting "Fuck [[Donald Trump|Trump]]" and "Fuck [[White Americans|white people]]" in the video.&lt;ref name="Domonoske 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Domonoske | first=Camila | title=4 Charged With Hate Crimes Over Beating Live-Streamed On Facebook | website=NPR.org | date=2017-01-05 | url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/01/05/508331652/4-people-in-custody-in-chicago-over-beating-live-streamed-on-facebook | accessdate=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/01/05/what-makes-a-crime-a-hate-crime-and-would-the-chicago-attack-qualify/ What makes a crime a 'hate crime'?

Police suspected that the attack stopped when neighbors in a downstairs apartment complained about noise levels.&lt;ref name = "Chicago Tribune, January 5, 2017"/&gt;

==Victim==
The victim was an 18-year-old,  mentally-disabled, white youth.&lt;ref name="Domonoske 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/black-captors-torture-white-victim-rant-against-trump-cpd-says/ 4 face hate crime charges in videotaped attack], Chicago Sun Times, January 4, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suspects and legal proceedings==
Four suspects were arrested and charged with [[aggravated]] [[kidnapping]], aggravated [[False imprisonment|unlawful restraint]], [[aggravated battery]], and [[hate crime]]. Two were 18-year-old males, Jordan Hill and Tesfaye Cooper, and one was Brittany Covington, an 18-year-old female; her sister Tanishia Covington was a 24-year-old female.&lt;ref name="Domonoske 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

On December 8, 2017, Brittany Covington plead guilty to the charges of committing a hate crime, intimidation and aggravated battery. Additional charges, such as kidnapping, were dropped as part of her plea deal. Covington was sentenced to four years of [[probation]] and 200 hours of community service. Cook County Circuit Judge William Hooks said that he could have sentenced her to prison, but did not because "I'm not sure if I did that you'd be coming out any better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crepeau|first1=Megan|title=Woman pleads guilty to hate crime in beating of disabled teen live on Facebook|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-met-facebook-live-beating-disabled-teen-20171208-story.html|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=9 December 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20171209071357/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-met-facebook-live-beating-disabled-teen-20171208-story.html|archivedate=2017-12-09|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-politics/woman-gets-probation-in-facebook-hate-crime-case/ Woman gets probation in Facebook hate-crime case], Chicago Sun-Times, December 8, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, 2018, Tesfaye Cooper (20yo) plead guilty to a hate crime and aggravated kidnapping&lt;ref&gt;https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/world/final-defendant-in-videotaped-beating-case-pleads-guilty/ar-AAzZrBW&lt;/ref&gt; and has been sentenced to seven years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fourth-suspect-sentenced-in-live-streamed-beating-of-disabled-teen/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and reactions==
On January 3, at approximately 5:15&amp;nbsp;p.m., Harrison District Officer Michael Donnelly saw the victim walking with the suspect that the victim had gone to high school with. The victim was observed by Officer Donnelly to be wearing summer clothing during winter conditions. Police said the victim appeared "injured" and "confused". After checking the victim's name through police databases it was discovered that he had been reported missing. Donnelly later stated, "I observed him wearing a tank top, inside-out, backwards, jean shorts and sandals on...He was bloodied. He was battered. He was very discombobulated."&lt;ref name = "Chicago Tribune, January 5, 2017"/&gt; Running the victim's name through police databases, Officer Donnelly discovered that the victim was reported as a missing person and brought him to the hospital.&lt;ref name = "Chicago Tribune, January 5, 2017"/&gt;

The live stream was later deleted, but archives still exist.&lt;ref name="Domonoske 2017"/&gt; There was widespread outrage over the beating.&lt;ref name="Yan Zdanowicz 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Yan | first=Holly | last2=Zdanowicz | first2=Christina | title=Police: No link between Chicago torture video and Black Lives Matter | website=CNN | date=2017-01-05 | url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/05/us/black-lives-matter-chicago-facebook-live-beating/index.html | accessdate=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its aftermath, the [[hashtag]] #BLMKidnapping was trending on [[Twitter]], implying a connection with the [[Black Lives Matter]] (BLM) movement.&lt;ref name="Yan Zdanowicz 2017"/&gt; None of the attackers specifically mentioned Black Lives Matter in the video and the police found there to be no direct connection.&lt;ref name="Bauer 2017"/&gt; Representatives for Black Lives Matter's Chicago branch denounced the beating and stated that they were uninvolved, and police stated that they found no evidence that Black Lives Matter was the motive of the incident.&lt;ref name="Bauer 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Bauer | first=Kelly | title='Ridiculous' To Blame Torture Video On Black Lives Matter, Activist Says | website=DNAinfo Chicago | date=2017-01-05 | url=https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20170105/hermosa/disabled-man-tortured-facebook-live-chicago-black-lives-matter-blm | accessdate=2017-01-27 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202072956/https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20170105/hermosa/disabled-man-tortured-facebook-live-chicago-black-lives-matter-blm | archivedate=2017-02-02 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some far right media outlets and conspiracy theorists (including [[Infowars]] and [[Glenn Beck]]) suggested that the rhetoric of Black Lives Matter and its supporters had encouraged the attackers. Other commentators disputed this.&lt;ref name="Yan Zdanowicz 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Glenn Beck Blames Black Lives Matter for Chicago Torture Video | website=The Daily Beast | date=2017-01-05 | url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2017/01/05/glenn-beck-blames-blm-for-chicago-torture-video.html | accessdate=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Barack Obama]] released a statement condemning the incident, saying, "What we have seen as surfacing, I think, are a lot of problems that have been there a long time... Whether it's tensions between police and communities, (or) hate crimes of the despicable sort that has just now recently surfaced on Facebook."&lt;ref name = "Chicago Tribune, January 5, 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama: Chicago live-stream hate crime is 'despicable'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38526456|accessdate=7 January 2017|publisher=''[[BBC News]]''|date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago Mayor [[Rahm Emanuel]] said, "Anyone who has seen it [finds the video] both sickening and sickened by it," while Illinois Governor [[Bruce Rauner]] and his wife [[Diana Rauner|Diana]] said that they were "deeply saddened and disturbed by the horrific violence" depicted in the live stream.&lt;ref name="Main Charles Grimm 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Main | first=Frank | last2=Charles | first2=Sam | last3=Grimm | first3=Andy | title=4 face hate crime charges in videotaped attack | website=Chicago Sun-Times | date=2017-01-04 | url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/black-captors-torture-white-victim-rant-against-trump-cpd-says/ | accessdate=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PassiveActive.JPG|thumb|310px|In the active transformation (left), a point moves from position P to P' by rotating clockwise by an angle θ about the origin of the coordinate system. In the passive transformation (right), point P does not move, while the coordinate system rotates counterclockwise by an angle θ about its origin. The coordinates of P' in the active case (that is, relative to the original coordinate system) are the same as the coordinates of P relative to the rotated coordinate system.]]

In [[physics]] and [[engineering]], spatial transformations in the 3-dimensional Euclidian space &lt;math&gt;\R^3&lt;/math&gt; are distinguished into '''active''' or '''alibi transformations''', and '''passive''' or '''alias transformations'''. An '''active transformation'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AlibiTransformation.html Weisstein, Eric W. "Alibi Transformation." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource.]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Transformation (mathematics)|transformation]] which actually changes the physical position (alibi, elsewhere) of a point, or [[rigid body]], which can be defined in the absence of a [[coordinate system]]; whereas a '''passive transformation'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AliasTransformation.html Weisstein, Eric W. "Alias Transformation." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource.]&lt;/ref&gt; is merely a change in the coordinate system in which the object is described (alias, other name) (change of coordinate map, or [[change of basis]]). By ''transformation'', [[mathematician]]s usually refer to active transformations, while [[physicist]]s and [[engineer]]s could mean either. Both types of transformation can be represented by a combination of a [[Translation (geometry)|translation]] and a [[linear transformation]].

Put differently, a ''passive'' transformation refers to description of the ''same'' object in two different coordinate systems.&lt;ref name= Davidson&gt;
{{cite book |title=Robots and screw theory: applications of kinematics and statics to robotics 
|author=Joseph K. Davidson, Kenneth Henderson Hunt 
|chapter=§4.4.1 The active interpretation and the active transformation |page=74 ''ff'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OQq67Tr7D0cC&amp;pg=PA74 
|isbn=0-19-856245-4 |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, an ''active transformation'' is a transformation of one or more objects with respect to the same coordinate system. For instance, active transformations are useful to describe successive positions of a rigid body. On the other hand, passive transformations may be useful in human motion analysis to observe the motion of the [[tibia]] relative to the [[femur]], that is, its motion relative to a (''local'') coordinate system which moves together with the femur, rather than a (''global'') coordinate system which is fixed to the floor.&lt;ref name = Davidson/&gt;

== Example ==
[[File:Alias and alibi rotations.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Rotation considered as a passive (''alias'') or active (''alibi'') transformation]]
[[File:Alias and alibi transformations 1 en.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Translation and rotation as passive (''alias'') or active (''alibi'') transformations]]
As an example, let the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=(v_1,v_2)\in \R^2&lt;/math&gt;, be a vector in the plane.  A rotation of the vector through an angle θ in counterclockwise direction is given by the [[rotation matrix]]:
:&lt;math&gt;R=
\begin{pmatrix}
 \cos \theta &amp; -\sin \theta\\
 \sin \theta &amp;  \cos \theta
\end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;
which can be viewed either as an ''active transformation'' or a ''passive transformation'' (where the above matrix will be inverted), as described below.

==Spatial transformations in the Euclidian space &lt;math&gt;\R^3&lt;/math&gt;==
In general a spatial transformation &lt;math&gt;T:\R^3\to \R^3&lt;/math&gt; may consist of a translation and a linear transformation. In the following, the translation will be omitted, and the linear transformation will be represented by a 3×3-matrix &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.

===Active transformation===
As an active transformation, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; transforms the initial vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=(v_x,v_y,v_z)&lt;/math&gt; into a new vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}'=(v'_x,v'_y,v'_z)=T\mathbf{v}=T(v_x,v_y,v_z)&lt;/math&gt;. 

If one views &lt;math&gt;\{\mathbf{e}'_x=T(1,0,0),\ \mathbf{e}'_y=T(0,1,0),\ \mathbf{e}'_z=T(0,0,1)\}&lt;/math&gt; as a new basis, then the coordinates of the new vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}'=v_x\mathbf{e}'_x+v_y\mathbf{e}'_y+v_z\mathbf{e}'_z&lt;/math&gt; in the new basis are the same as those of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=v_x\mathbf{e}_x+v_y\mathbf{e}_y+v_z\mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt; in the original basis. Note that active transformations make sense even as a linear transformation into a different vector space. It makes sense to write the new vector in the unprimed basis (as above) only when the transformation is from the space into itself.

=== Passive transformation ===
On the other hand, when one views &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; as a passive transformation, the initial vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=(v_x,v_y,v_z)&lt;/math&gt; is left unchanged, while the coordinate system and its basis vectors are transformed in the opposite direction, i.e. with the inverse transformation &lt;math&gt;T^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

{{cite book |isbn=1-4020-5457-2 |year=2007 |publisher=Springer |title=The theory of the Moiré phenomenon: Aperiodic layers |first=Isaac|last=Amidror
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_QRomE5g3QC&amp;pg=PT361 |chapter=Appendix D: Remark D.12 |page=346 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; This gives a new coordinate system XYZ with basis vectors:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_X=T^{-1}(1,0,0),\ \mathbf{e}_Y=T^{-1}(0,1,0),\ \mathbf{e}_Z=T^{-1}(0,0,1)&lt;/math&gt;

The new coordinates &lt;math&gt;(v_X,v_Y,v_Z)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the new coordinate system XYZ are given by: 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=(v_x,v_y,v_z)=v_Xe_X+v_Ye_Y+v_Ze_Z=T^{-1}(v_X,v_Y,v_Z)&lt;/math&gt;.

From this equation one sees that the new coordinates are given by
:&lt;math&gt;(v_X,v_Y,v_Z)=T(v_x,v_y,v_z)&lt;/math&gt;.

As a passive transformation &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; transforms the old coordinates into the new ones.

Note the difference between &lt;math&gt;(v_X,v_Y,v_Z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(v'_x,v'_y,v'_z)&lt;/math&gt;

In [[Hindu philosophy]], the [[Sanskrit]] aphorism '''''Ahaṁ Brahmāsmi''''' ([[Devanagari]]: अहं ब्रह्मास्मि) "I am [[Brahman]]"&lt;ref&gt;[https://iskcondesiretree.com/group/krishnaconsciousness/forum/topics/q-what-is-the-meaning-of-aham-brahmasmi Meaning of Aham Brahamasmi]&lt;/ref&gt; or "I am the Infinite Reality"{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} or "I am the Ultimate". It is one of the four [[Mahavakyas]] used to explain the unity of [[macrocosm and microcosm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gurumayum Ranjit Sharma |title=The Idealistic Philosophy of Swami Vivekananda |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ORYOsJHi53sC&amp;pg=PA180 |year=1987 |publisher=Atlantic |page=180 |id=GGKEY:PSWXE5NTFF4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==

Literally, ''Aham'' (अहं) means "I", that which cannot be deserted or abandoned on account of being constant, unavoidable, ever present. ''Brahma'' (ब्रह्म) means ever-full or whole (ब्रह्म is the first case ending singular of Brahman) and ''Asmi'' (अस्मि) means "am," the first-person singular present tense of the verb "अस्," "to be."{{cn|date=July 2018}} This ''mahāvākya'' is in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] of the [[Yajurveda#Shukla Yajurveda|Shukla Yajurveda]].

[[Brahman]] is the Infinite Reality, the all encompassing existence in itself; only when the ego dies can this be realized. In this aphorism the "I" is not the limited [[wikt:transmigration|transmigrating]] ego, the doer and the enjoyer within, and also not the body and the mind. Man (who is a conscious entity) alone has the capacity to improve his present state, to guide his future, to enquire and know the truth, and to free himself from the cycle of birth and death (''vidyā adhikāra'') through thoughtful actions (''karma adhikāra'').{{cn|date=July 2018}}

[[Vidyaranya|Vidyāranya]] in his [[Panchadasi]] (V.4) explains:
: स्वतः पूर्णः परात्माऽत्र ब्रह्मशब्देन वर्णितः |
: अस्मीत्यैक्य-परामर्शः तेन ब्रह्म भवाम्यहम् ||

: "Infinite by nature, the Supreme Self is described here by the word ''Brahman'' (lit. ever expanding; the ultimate reality); the word ''asmi'' denotes the identity of ''aham'' and ''Brahman''. Therefore, (the meaning of the expression is) "I am Brahman."

This realization is gained through true enquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Swami Tejomayananda, Mādhava |title=Pañcadaśī, chapters 5, 10 and 15 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3UCHnUq18pUC&amp;pg=PA12 |year=1999 |publisher=Chinmaya Mission |isbn=978-81-7597-036-6 |pages=9–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== In Vaishnavism ===
Vaishnavas, when they talk about Brahman, usually refer to impersonal Brahman, brahmajyoti (rays of Brahman). Brahman according to them means God - Narayana, Rama or Krishna. Thus, the meaning of "aham brahma asmi" according to their philosophy is that "I am a drop of Ocean of Consciousness.", or "I am soul, part of cosmic spirit, Parabrahma". Here, the term Parabrahma is introduced to avoid confusion. If Brahman can mean soul (though, Parabrahma is also the soul, but Supreme one - Paramatma), then Parabrahma should refer to God, Lord Vishnu.

==Significance==
This memorable expression appears in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] when the sage, in the context of meditation on the Self, in reply to the query – What did that Brahma know by which It became all? - states:-

: "ब्रह्म वा इदमग्र आसीत्, तदात्मनामेवावेत्, अहं ब्रह्मास्मीति | तस्मात्तत्सर्वमभवत्; तद्यो यो देवानां प्रत्यबुध्यत स एव तदभवत्, तदषीर्णाम् तथा मनुष्याणाम्,..."

: "This (self) was indeed Brahman in the beginning; It knew only Itself as, "I am Brahman". Therefore It became all; and whoever among the gods knew It also became That; and the same with sages and men…” - (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad I.iv.10)

In his comment on this passage [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] explains that here Brahman is not the conditioned Brahman (saguna), that a transitory entity cannot be eternal, that knowledge about Brahman, the infinite all-pervading entity, has been enjoined, that knowledge of non-duality alone dispels ignorance and that the meditation based on resemblance is only an idea. He also tells us that the expression ''Aham Brahmaasmi'' is the explanation of the [[mantra]] –

: पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदं पूर्णात्पूर्णमुदच्यते |
: पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते ||

: "That ('Brahman') is infinite, and this ('universe') is infinite; the infinite proceeds from the infinite. (Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite ('universe'), it remains as the infinite ('Brahman') alone." - (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad V.i.1)

He explains that non-duality and plurality are contradictory only when applied to the Self, which is eternal and without parts, but not to the effects, which have parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Brhadaranayaka Upanishad|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=98-105,557,559|url= https://archive.org/details/Brihadaranyaka.Upanishad.Shankara.Bhashya.by.Swami.Madhavananda}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''aham'' in this memorable expression is not closed in itself as a pure mental abstraction but it is radical openness. Between Brahman and ''aham-brahma'' lies the entire temporal universe experienced by the ignorant as a separate entity (duality).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Raimundo Panikkar |title=Mantramañjari |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M01LSxaneasC&amp;pg=PA743 |year=1994 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1280-2 |pages=742–743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequence==

The difference between Brahma and atma emerges most clearly where they appear side by side with one another such as - स वा अयमात्मा ब्रह्म विज्ञानमयो मनोमयः प्राणमयः – 'That Self is indeed Brahma, as also identified with the intellect, the mind and the vital-force'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Swami Parmeshwaranand |title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Upanisads |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mgwzp6-HTTIC&amp;pg=PA219 |year=2000 |publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons |isbn=978-81-7625-148-8 |pages=219 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Isha Upanishad]] tells us that the Supreme Brahma present in the ''Mukhya Prana'' is the bearer of the secret names of ''Aham'' and ''Asmi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=B. N. Krishnamurti Sharma |title=History of the Dvaita School of Vedānta and Its Literature: From the Earliest Beginnings to Our Own Times |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FVtpFMPMulcC&amp;pg=PA609 |year=2000 |publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |isbn=978-81-208-1575-9 |page=609 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sankara proclaims that there is a plane where everything is entirely "different"; where laws of ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'' no longer apply; where distinctions like subject and object fall away; where ''[[Tat Tvam Asi]]'' and ''Aham Brahma asmi'' are actually felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hans Torwesten |title=Vedanta: Heart of Hinduism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TWptZtEa0hcC&amp;pg=PA152 |date=January 1994 |publisher=Grove/Atlantic |isbn=978-0-8021-3262-8 |page=152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5220">The '''[[Asilomar Conference Grounds|Asilomar]] International Conference on Climate Intervention Technologies''' was a [[academic conference|conference]] developed by [[Margaret Leinen]] of the Climate Response Fund and chaired by [[Michael MacCracken]] of the Climate Institute. The conference took place in March 2010 and the recommendations were published in November 2010. The goal was identify and minimize risks involved with [[climate engineering]] (geoengineering), and was based on the 1975 [[Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA]] which discussed the potential biohazards and regulation of [[biotechnology]]. A group of over 150 scientist and engineers gathered together with lawyers, environmentalists and [[disaster relief]] workers in an open meeting to avoid accusations of conspiracy  during this discussion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/video/#/Shows/Doc_Zone/1242299559/ID=1664956266 CBC.ca Player&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Asilomar Conference focused exclusively on the development of [[Disaster Risk Reduction|risk reduction]] guidelines for climate intervention experiments.&lt;ref name="climateresponsefund.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://climateresponsefund.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=137&amp;Itemid=81 |title=Conference Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2010-11-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016101517/http://climateresponsefund.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=137&amp;Itemid=81 |archive-date=2012-10-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals of the Conference&lt;ref name="climateresponsefund.org"/&gt;==

*Identify potential risks associated with climate intervention experiments
*Propose a system to assess experiment design for potential categorical risks{{what?|date=April 2012}} and suggest precautions to assure their safe conduct
*Propose voluntary standards for climate intervention research for the international scientific community

==Recommendations&lt;ref&gt;http://climateresponsefund.org/images/Conference/finalfinalreport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;==
*The core rationale for pursuit of climate engineering research is to advance the collective well-being of society and the environment;
*Climate engineering research is internationally planned and coordinated;
*Appropriately scoped governmental oversight, public involvement, and decision-making takes place during consideration and conduct of planned activities;
*Transparency and exchange of research plans, data, and findings minimize the need for environmentally disruptive experiments and maximize the learning from experiments that are conducted; and
*Regular, independent evaluation and assessment of the extent of understanding and uncertainty is carried out to provide optimal information and confidence for the public and policymakers.

In [[mathematics]], '''biangular coordinates''' are a [[coordinate system]] for the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] where &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; are two fixed points, and the position of a point ''P'' not on the line &lt;math&gt;\overline{C_1C_2}&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the angles &lt;math&gt;\angle PC_1C_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\angle PC_2C_1&lt;/math&gt; .

'''Boot camps''' can be governmental being part of the correctional and [[penal system]] of some countries.  Modeled after military [[recruit training]] camps, these programs are based on shock incarceration grounded on military techniques. The aggressive training used has resulted in deaths in a variety of circumstances. Boot camps are also criticized around the world for their lack of behavioral change and for the way extreme force can traumatize children and teenagers.&lt;ref name="nytimes-deaths

==Criticisms==
Other countries have been closely watching the boot camp system in the U.S. but so far have been slow to copy it, if at all.

There are no research findings in favor of boot camps in light of any of the initial intentions. [[Recidivism]] rates in the U.S. among former prison inmates and boot camp participants are roughly the same. Yet, the effects of boot camps are controversially disputed, some surveys claiming lower re-offence rates, others showing no change as compared to persons serving normal time. Surveys also show different results concerning the reduction of costs. Critics add that the emphasis on authority can only result in frustration, resentment, anger, short temper, a low self-esteem and [[aggression]] rather than [[respect]].

According to the [[New York Times]] there have been 31 known deaths of youths in U.S. boot camps since 1980.&lt;ref name="nytimes-deaths"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/15/us/states-pressed-as-3-boys-die-at-boot-camps.html|title=States Pressed As 3 Boys Die At Boot Camps |last=Janofsky |first=Michael |date=2001-07-15 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage around the world==

===Australia===
In [[Australia]] the Premier of the state of Queensland [[Campbell Newman]] announced that bootcamps for convicted young people will open in Townsville and Rockhampton by September 2013, along with two other camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Newman announces boot camps for young offenders|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/newman-announces-boot-camps-for-young-offenders-20130324-2gnp6.html#ixzz2OQlC99gD|accessdate=27 March 2013|newspaper=Brisbane Times|date=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada participation in boot camp programs is voluntary, so as to avoid any challenges under the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] under which treatment at boot camps could be seen as an infringement on a youth's right to not be subject to cruel and unusual punishment and to ensure security of person. Canada started a boot camp project for non-violent juveniles with differences from the American models. The first one was opened in 1997 in Ontario. Unlike in the US system it is not possible to trade or shorten a jail sentence with a significantly shorter boot camp program.

Canadian boot camps do not have the time frame of 90 to 180 days and they are restricted to juveniles under 18, and are not yet open to female offenders. The judges do not directly possess the authority to send a youth to a boot camp. They may impose a sentence of secure or open custody. The latter is defined as, "a community residential center, group home, child care institution or forest or wilderness camp..." Once an open custody sentence is granted, a correctional official decides whether a sentence is served in a boot camp program. But the ultimate decision rests with the young person and the decision is made purely on the merits of the program because the time served remains the same.

The Canadian system is too new to show any comparable results but research has been done among US boot camps with different emphases, e.g. more on drug treatment or education than solely on military drill. According to the findings treatment has a slightly positive impact on the reduction of recidivism over strict discipline.

===New Zealand===
[[New Zealand]] set up its first boot camps in 1971 but they were abandoned in 1981. The boot camps were regarded as a failure with a 71% rate of re-offending among corrective trainees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0902/S00180.htm|title=Boot Camps no more than "Correctional Quackery" - Rethinking Crime and Punishment press release|date=17 February 2009|work=[[Scoop (website)|Scoop]]|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to being elected into Government in 2008 the [[National Party of New Zealand|National Party]] released a policy of using boot camps for those with drug problems.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_242511"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/242511 |title=Boot camps for teen crims in Nats' plan |date=29 January 2008 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|Fifth National Government]] introduced military-style activity camps (MACs) run by the [[New Zealand Defence Force]] for forty of the most serious recidivist young offenders which involved marching exercises, mentoring, drug and alcohol treatment programs, education, and an assisted move back into the community. The Government also launched a nine-week camp for the most serious, recidivist offenders in [[Christchurch]] in 2010 and a court-supervised programme providing up to ten days of adventure camp activities. While the-then Deputy Prime Minister [[Paula Bennett]] claimed the programmes had succeeded in lowering offending among that group, this was disputed by [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[John Key]]'s chief science adviser Sir [[Peter Gluckman]] in a 2011 report. The [[Superu|New Zealand Families Commission]] concluded that military camps and other measures such as curfews with electronic monitoring could not reduce re-offending on their own and that the most successful rehabilitation programmes involved the offenders' families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boot camps tried and rejected - youth advocates|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/337099/boot-camps-tried-and-rejected-youth-advocates|accessdate=14 August 2017|publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]]|date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maxwell|first1=Gabrielle|title=Youth offenders - Programmes for young offenders|url=https://www.teara.govt.nz/en/youth-offenders/page-4|publisher=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 13 August 2017, Prime Minister [[Bill English]] promised to establish a boot camp known as the "Junior Training Academy" for youth offenders at the [[Waiouru Military Camp]] during the [[New Zealand general election, 2017|2017 election campaign]]. English clarified that the camp would be for small group of around 150 young offenders who had committed serious offenses including serious assault, sexual assaults, aggravated robbery and murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirk|first1=Stacey|title=Special bootcamp for youth offenders at Waiouru army camp, under National|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/95727988/special-bootcamp-for-youth-offenders-at-waiouru-army-camp-under-national|accessdate=14 August 2017|agency=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|date=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, youth Justice advocacy group JustSpeak director Katie Bruce criticized the proposed boot camp policy and argued that it would do little to curb re-offending among young offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=5:22 am today Boot camps tried and rejected - youth advocates|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/337099/boot-camps-tried-and-rejected-youth-advocates|accessdate=14 August 2017|publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]]|date=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; National's proposed policy was criticized by the radio host [[Mark Sainsbury (broadcaster)|Mark Sainsbury]], [[The Opportunities Party]] leader [[Gareth Morgan (economist)|Gareth Morgan]], the [[New Zealand First]] leader [[Winston Peters]], and the [[University of Canterbury]] psychologist and author Jarrod Gilbert, who contended that the policy was aimed at enticing voters rather than helping youth offenders and that previous boot camp programmes had failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sainsbury|first1=Mark|title=Mark Sainsbury: National's bootcamp policy is for voters, not offenders|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/election/2017/08/mark-sainsbury-national-s-bootcamp-policy-is-for-voters-not-offenders.html|accessdate=14 August 2017|publisher=[[Newshub]]|date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Satherley|first1=Dan|title=Boot camps don't work - Gareth Morgan, crime expert|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/election/2017/08/boot-camps-don-t-work-gareth-morgan-crime-expert.html|accessdate=14 August 2017|publisher=Newshub|date=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boot camp policy was also criticized by both National's support partner, the [[Māori Party]], and the opposition [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] for doing little to address youth offending within the [[Māori people|Māori]] and the [[Pacific Islander#New Zealand|Pasifika]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Nicholas|title=Maori Party: National's boot camp plan an 'attack on Maori and Pasifika children'|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11903919|accessdate=14 August 2017|publisher=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Seymour (politician)|David Seymour]], the leader of National's support partner the [[ACT New Zealand|ACT Party]], criticized the boot camp policy as a sign of the Government's failure to tackle "broken families" and youth crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Audrey|title=Act's David Seymour calls out National's law and order policy|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11903379|accessdate=14 August 2017|publisher=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The first boot camps appeared in the states of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Oklahoma]] in 1983. Boot camps are intended to be less restrictive than prison but harsher than [[probation]].

In most U.S. states participation in boot camp programs is offered to young first-time offenders in place of a prison term or [[probation]]; in some states{{Where|date=July 2011}} a youth can also be [[sentence (law)|sentenced]] to participate in such a program. The time served can range from 90 to 180 days, which can make up for prison sentences of up to 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://problemwithteens.com/helping-troubled-teens/troubled-teen-boot-camps-2/|title=Troubled Teen Boot Camps - Problem with Teens, Troubled teens, help for troubled teens|work=problemwithteens.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140329093203/http://problemwithteens.com/helping-troubled-teens/troubled-teen-boot-camps-2/|archivedate=2014-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Federal shock incarceration programs are authorized under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/4046- 18 U.S.C. § 4046], although the placement requires consent of the prisoner.

In 1995, the U.S. federal government and about two-thirds of the 50 states were operating boot camp programs. Presently, there are no statistics as to how many boot camps there are in the U.S. today. In 2000, there were 51 boot camps still open.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/197018.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many types of boot camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegebound.net/content/cat/types-of-boarding-schools/349/|title=Collegebound Network|work=collegebound.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some boot camps are more therapeutic. Boot camps such as West Ridge Academy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Windmeyer |first=Shane |url=http://www.collegebound.net/content/article/boarding-school-spotlight-west-ridge-academy/8574/ |title=Boarding School Spotlight: West Ridge Academy |publisher=Collegebound.net |date= |accessdate=2013-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218215825/http://www.collegebound.net/content/article/boarding-school-spotlight-west-ridge-academy/8574/ |archivedate=2012-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in West Jordan, Utah offer a wide range of activities, academics, and boarding school treatment programs to give students a well-rounded education.

State run boot camps were banned in [[Florida]] on June 1, 2006 through legislation signed by [[Florida Governor]] [[Jeb Bush]] after 14-year-old [[Martin Lee Anderson]] died during his abidance in a boot camp. Anderson died as [[drill instructor]]s beat him and encouraged him to continue physical exercise after he had collapsed. While Anderson was unconscious, guards placed [[Smelling salts|ammonia tablets]] near his [[Human nose|nose]] in an attempt to revive him, and he suffocated. Anderson attended Bay County Boot Camp in [[Panama City, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=WJHG|title= Boot Camps Abolished in Florida|url=http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/2905871.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Victory Forge Military Academy]] in Florida has come under intense scrutiny of its methods, which border on physical abuse. The camp's defense is that the parents had signed a contract authorizing the use of physical force against their children.

==Alternatives==
Boot camps claim to remove children "from environments filled with negative influences and triggering events that produce self-defeating, reckless or self-destructive behavior". Other types of programs (see  [[outdoor education]], [[adventure therapy]], and [[wilderness therapy]]) use this method while avoiding all or some of the controversial methods of boot camps, and they claim lower [[recidivism]].

The term "'''capitalist realism'''" has been used, particularly in [[Germany]], to describe commodity-based art, from [[Pop Art]] in the 1950s and 1960s to the commodity art of the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, p.53&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it has been used to describe the ideological-aesthetic aspect of contemporary [[corporate capitalism]] in the West. When used in this way, it is a play on the term "[[socialist realism]]".

==In art==
Although attested earlier,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. by [[Abraham Polonsky]] of [[Edward Dmytryk|Edward Dmytryk's]] ''[[The Caine Mutiny (film)|The Caine Mutiny]]'': William Pechter and Abraham Polonsky, 'Abraham Polonsky and "Force of Evil"', ''Film Quarterly'', 15.3 [Special Issue on Hollywood] (Spring, 1962), 47-54 (p. 53); https://www.jstor.org/stable/1210628.&lt;/ref&gt; the phrase "capitalist realism" was first used in the title of the 1963 [[art exhibition]] in [[Düsseldorf, Germany|Düsseldorf]], ''Demonstration for Capitalist Realism'', which featured the work of [[Gerhard Richter]], [[Sigmar Polke]], [[Wolf Vostell]], and [[:de:Konrad Fischer (Maler)|Konrad Lueg]].&lt;ref&gt;Honour, Hugh. ''A World History of Art'', Laurence King Publishing, p847. {{ISBN|1-85669-451-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exhibition's participants focused upon depictions of Germany's growing consumer culture and media-saturated society with strategies, in part, influenced by those of their American Pop&lt;ref name="Living With Pop: A Reproduction of Capitalist Realism' at Artists Space"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://observer.com/2014/07/living-with-pop-a-reproduction-of-capitalist-realism-at-artists-space/ | title=Living With Pop: A Reproduction of Capitalist Realism' at Artists Space | publisher=The New York Observer | date=23 July 2014 | accessdate=20 November 2014 | author=Pollack,  Maika | quote=It was a reaction to Pop from a postwar Germany divided between East and West.}}&lt;/ref&gt; counterparts. The recent rise in [[Pop art|Pop Art]] in German culture was coupled by a fascination with America, which served as a stimulation for the piece. They were inspired primarily by the iconography depicted in newspapers and magazines.

==Sigmar Polke==
{{main|Sigmar Polke}}

Capitalist realism is a German art movement co-founded in 1963 by artist [[Sigmar Polke]].&lt;ref name="German artist Sigmar Polke, creator of 'Higher Beings Command,' dies at 69"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/12/AR2010061203694.html | title=German artist Sigmar Polke, creator of 'Higher Beings Command,' dies at 69 | publisher=The Washington Post | date=13 June 2010 | accessdate=17 November 2014 | author=Schudel, Matt | quote=In the 1960s, Mr. Polke was at the vanguard of a German artistic movement called capitalist realism, along with fellow painter Gerhard Richter -- who later expressed reservations about his colleague's work, saying "he refuses to accept any borders, any limits."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polke embraced the advertising and publicity commonly found in the popular press in renderings of everyday consumer items. Often ironic and with critical overtones of society and politics the Capitalist Realism movement is considered more explicitly political than conventional Pop Art.&lt;ref&gt;Crow, Thomas. ''The Rise of the Sixties: American and European Art in the age of Dissent'' {{ISBN|1856694267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Michael Schudson==
{{main|Michael Schudson}}

In the mid-1980s, [[Michael Schudson]] used the term "capitalist realism" to describe mainstream practices in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter seven of Schudson's ''Advertising: The Uneasy Persuasion'' compares the messages and appeals of advertising to those found in the Socialist Realism of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schudson, 'Advertising as Capitalist Realism', in ''Advertising, The Uneasy Persuasion: Its Dubious Impact on American Society'' (New York: Basic Books, 1984), pp. 209-33 (repr. in ''
Advertising &amp; Society Review'', vol. 1, issue 1 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; In his account, the realism of advertising promotes a way of life based on private consumption, rather than social, public achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Harry; MacRury, Isin; Botterill, Jackie. ''The Dynamics of Advertising'', Routledge, 2000, p99. {{ISBN|90-5823-085-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mark Fisher==
{{main|Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?}}

The term next appeared in 2009 with the publication of Mark Fisher's book ''[[Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?]]''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mark Fisher, ''Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?'' (Winchester, UK; Washington [D.C.]: Zero, 2009); {{ISBN|978-1-84694-317-1}} (pbk.); 1846943175 (pbk.).&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher argues that the term "capitalist realism" best describes the current global political situation, which lacks visible alternatives to the capitalist system which became dominant following the fall of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His argument is a response to, and critique of, [[neo-liberalism]] and new forms of government which apply the logic of [[capitalism]] and the market to all aspects of governance.

His ideology refers to a perceived "widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but also that it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?|last=Fisher|first=Mark|publisher=Zero Books|year=2010|isbn=|location=Winchester, UK|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a philosophical concept, capitalist realism is influenced by the [[Althusserian]] conception of ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?|last=Fisher|first=Mark|publisher=Zero Books|year=2009|isbn=978-1846943171|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher proposes that within a capitalist framework there is no space to conceive of alternative forms of social structures, adding that younger generations are not even concerned with recognizing alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Capitalist Realism. Is There No Alternative?|last=Fisher|first=Mark|publisher=O Books|year=2009|isbn=9781846943171|location=|pages=8|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He proposes that the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 financial crisis]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; compounded this position. Rather than catalyzing a desire to seek alternatives for the existing model, the crisis reinforced the notion that modifications must be made within the existing system. The crash confirmed within the populace the necessity of capitalism rather than shake it loose from its foundations.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Capitalist realism as I understand it cannot be confined to art or to the quasi-propagandistic way in which advertising functions. It is more like a pervasive atmosphere, conditioning not only the production of culture but also the regulation of work and education, and acting as a kind of invisible barrier constraining thought and action.''&lt;ref&gt;Mark Fisher, ''Capitalist Realism: Is there no Alternative?'' (Winchester, UK; Washington [D.C.]: Zero, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fisher argues that capitalist realism has propagated a 'business [[ontology]]' which concludes that everything should be run as a business including education and healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Fisher, ''Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?'' (Winchester, UK; Washington [D.C.]: Zero, 2009, pg15).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of Fisher's work, the term has been picked up by other literary critics.&lt;ref&gt;Prominently Mark Fisher and Jeremy Gilbert, 'Capitalist Realism and Neoliberal Hegemony: A Dialogue', ''New Formations'', 80--81 (2013), 89--101 DOI:10.3898/NEWF.80/81.05.2013; ''Reading Capitalist Realism'', ed. by Alison Shonkwiler and Leigh Claire La Berge (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cartesian-coordinate-system.svg|thumb|right|250px|Illustration of a Cartesian coordinate plane. Four points are marked and labeled with their coordinates: {{nowrap|(2, 3)}} in green, {{nowrap|(−3, 1)}} in red, {{nowrap|(−1.5, −2.5)}} in blue, and the origin {{nowrap|(0, 0)}} in purple.]]
A '''Cartesian coordinate system''' is a [[coordinate system]] that specifies each [[point (geometry)|point]] uniquely in a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] by a set of [[number|numerical]] '''coordinates''', which are the [[positive and negative numbers|signed]] distances to the point from two fixed [[perpendicular]] directed lines, measured in the same [[unit length|unit of length]]. Each reference line is called a ''coordinate axis'' or just ''axis'' (plural ''axes'') of the system, and the point where they meet is its ''[[Origin (mathematics)|origin]]'', at ordered pair {{nowrap|(0, 0)}}. The coordinates can also be defined as the positions of the [[orthogonal projection|perpendicular projections]] of the point onto the two axes, expressed as signed distances from the origin.

One can use the same principle to specify the position of any point in [[three-dimensional space]] by three Cartesian coordinates, its signed distances to three mutually perpendicular planes (or, equivalently, by its perpendicular projection onto three mutually perpendicular lines). In general, ''n'' Cartesian coordinates (an element of [[real n-space|real ''n''-space]]) specify the point in an ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] for any [[dimension]] ''n''. These coordinates are equal, up to [[sign (mathematics)|sign]], to distances from the point to ''n'' mutually perpendicular [[hyperplane]]s.

[[File:Cartesian-coordinate-system-with-circle.svg|thumb|right|250px|Cartesian coordinate system with a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin marked in red. The equation of a circle is {{nowrap|1=(''x'' − ''a'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (''y'' − ''b'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} where ''a'' and ''b'' are the coordinates of the center {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}} and ''r'' is the radius.]]

The invention of Cartesian coordinates in the 17th century by [[René Descartes]] ([[Latinisation (literature)|Latinized]] name: ''Cartesius'') revolutionized mathematics by providing the first systematic link between [[Euclidean geometry]] and [[algebra]]. Using the Cartesian coordinate system, geometric shapes (such as [[curve]]s) can be described by '''Cartesian equations''': algebraic [[equation]]s involving the coordinates of the points lying on the shape. For example, a circle of radius 2, centered at the origin of the plane, may be described as the set of all points whose coordinates ''x'' and ''y'' satisfy the equation {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4}}.

Cartesian coordinates are the foundation of [[analytic geometry]], and provide enlightening geometric interpretations for many other branches of mathematics, such as [[linear algebra]], [[complex analysis]], [[differential geometry]], multivariate [[calculus]], [[group theory]] and more. A familiar example is the concept of the [[graph of a function]]. Cartesian coordinates are also essential tools for most applied disciplines that deal with geometry, including [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[engineering]] and many more. They are the most common coordinate system used in [[computer graphics]], [[computer-aided geometric design]] and other [[computational geometry|geometry-related data processing]].

==History==
The adjective ''Cartesian'' refers to the French [[mathematician]] and [[philosopher]] [[René Descartes]] who published this idea in 1637. It was independently discovered by [[Pierre de Fermat]], who also worked in three dimensions, although Fermat did not publish the discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/analytic-geometry|title=Analytic geometry|last=Bix|first=Robert A.|last2=D'Souza|first2=Harry J.|date=|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French cleric [[Nicole Oresme#Mathematics|Nicole Oresme]], used constructions similar to Cartesian coordinates well before the time of Descartes and Fermat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EVRSDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT307&amp;dq=Nicole+Oresme+coordinate#v=onepage&amp;q=Nicole%20Oresme%20coordinate&amp;f=false|title=The Routledge Handbook of Mapping and Cartography|last=Kent|first=Alexander J.|last2=Vujakovic|first2=Peter|date=2017-10-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317568216|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Descartes and Fermat used a single axis in their treatments and have a variable length measured in reference to this axis. The concept of using a pair of axes was introduced later, after Descartes' ''[[La Géométrie]]'' was translated into Latin in 1649 by [[Frans van Schooten]] and his students. These commentators introduced several concepts while trying to clarify the ideas contained in Descartes' work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burton|2011|loc=p. 374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the Cartesian coordinate system would play a fundamental role in the development of the [[calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].&lt;ref&gt;A Tour of the Calculus, David Berlinski&lt;/ref&gt; The two-coordinate description of the plane was later generalized into the concept of [[vector spaces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Linear Algebra Done Right - Springer|last=Axler|first=Sheldon|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=978-3-319-11079-0|location=|pages=1|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-11080-6|series = Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other coordinate systems have been developed since Descartes, such as the [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] for the plane, and the [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical]] and [[Cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical coordinates]] for three-dimensional space.

==Description==

===One dimension {{Anchor|Cartesian coordinates in one dimension}}===
{{Main article|number line}}
Choosing a Cartesian coordinate system for a one-dimensional space{{snd}} that is, for a straight line—involves choosing a point ''O'' of the line (the origin), a unit of length, and an orientation for the line. An orientation chooses which of the two half-lines determined by ''O'' is the positive, and which is negative; we then say that the line "is oriented" (or "points") from the negative half towards the positive half. Then each point ''P'' of the line can be specified by its distance from ''O'', taken with a + or − sign depending on which half-line contains ''P''.

A line with a chosen Cartesian system is called a '''number line'''. Every real number has a unique location on the line. Conversely, every point on the line can be interpreted as a [[number]] in an ordered continuum such as the real numbers.

===Two dimensions {{Anchor|Cartesian coordinates in two dimensions}}===
{{Further information|two-dimensional space}}
A Cartesian coordinate system in two dimensions (also called a '''rectangular coordinate system''' or an '''orthogonal coordinate system'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) is defined by an [[ordered pair]] of [[perpendicular]] lines (axes), a single [[unit of length]] for both axes, and an orientation for each axis. The point where the axes meet is taken as the origin for both, thus turning each axis into a number line.   For any point ''P'', a line is drawn through ''P'' perpendicular to each axis, and the position where it meets the axis is interpreted as a number.  The two numbers, in that chosen order, are the ''Cartesian coordinates'' of ''P''.  The reverse construction allows one to determine the point ''P'' given its coordinates.

The first and second coordinates are called the ''[[abscissa]]'' and the ''[[ordinate]]'' of ''P'', respectively; and the point where the axes meet is called the ''origin'' of the coordinate system.   The coordinates are usually written as two numbers in parentheses, in that order, separated by a comma, as in {{nowrap|(3, -10.5)}}.  Thus the origin has coordinates {{nowrap|(0,0)}}, and the points on the positive half-axes, one unit away from the origin, have coordinates {{nowrap|(1,0)}} and {{nowrap|(0,1)}}.

In mathematics, physics, and engineering, the first axis is usually defined or depicted as horizontal and oriented to the right, and the second axis is vertical and oriented upwards.  (However, in some [[computer graphics]] contexts, the ordinate axis may be oriented downwards.) The origin is often labeled ''O'', and the two coordinates are often denoted by the letters ''X'' and ''Y'', or ''x'' and ''y''. The axes may then be referred to as the ''X''-axis and ''Y''-axis.   The choices of letters come from the original convention, which is to use the latter part of the alphabet to indicate unknown values. The first part of the alphabet was used to designate known values. 

A [[Euclidean plane]] with a chosen Cartesian coordinate system ''Cartesian plane''.  In a Cartesian plane one can define canonical representatives of certain geometric figures, such as the [[unit circle]] (with radius equal to the length unit, and center at the origin), the [[unit square]] (whose diagonal has endpoints at {{nowrap|(0,0)}} and {{nowrap|(1,1)}}),  the  [[unit hyperbola]], and so on.

The two axes divide the plane into four [[right angle]]s, called ''quadrant''.  The quadrants may be named or numbered in various ways, but the quadrant where all coordinates are  positive is usually called the ''first quadrant''.

If the coordinates of a point are {{nowrap|(''x'',''y'')}}, then its [[distance from a point to a line|distances]] from the ''X''-axis and from the ''Y''-axis are |''y''| and |''x''|, respectively; where |...| denotes the [[absolute value (algebra)|absolute value]] of a number.

===Three dimensions {{Anchor|Cartesian coordinates in three dimensions}} ===
{{Further information|three-dimensional space}}

[[File:Coord system CA 0.svg|thumb|240px|A three dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, with origin ''O'' and axis lines ''X'', ''Y'' and ''Z'', oriented as shown by the arrows. The tick marks on the axes are one length unit apart. The black dot shows the point with coordinates {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 2}}, {{nowrap|1=''y'' = 3}}, and {{nowrap|1=''z'' = 4}}, or {{nowrap|(2, 3, 4)}}.]]

A Cartesian coordinate system for a three-dimensional space consists of an ordered triplet of lines (the ''axes'') that go through a common point (the ''origin''), and are pair-wise perpendicular; an orientation  for each axis; and a single unit of length for all three axes.  As in the two-dimensional case, each axis becomes a number line.  For any point ''P'' of space, one considers a plane through ''P'' perpendicular to each coordinate axis, and interprets the point where that plane cuts the axis as a number.  The Cartesian coordinates of ''P'' are those three numbers, in the chosen order. The reverse construction determines the point ''P'' given its three coordinates.

Alternatively, each coordinate of a point ''P'' can be taken as the distance from ''P'' to the plane defined by the other two axes, with the sign determined by the orientation of the corresponding axis. 

Each pair of axes defines a ''coordinate plane''. These planes divide space into eight [[trihedron|trihedra]], called ''octants''.

The coordinates are usually written as three numbers (or algebraic formulas) surrounded by parentheses and separated by commas, as in {{nowrap|(3,-2.5,1)}} or {{nowrap|(''t'',''u''+''v'',π/2)}}.  Thus, the origin has coordinates {{nowrap|(0,0,0)}}, and the unit points on the three axes are {{nowrap|(1,0,0)}}, {{nowrap|(0,1,0)}}, and {{nowrap|(0,0,1)}}.

There are no standard names for the coordinates in the three axes (however, the terms ''abscissa'', ''ordinate'' and ''applicate'' are sometimes used). The coordinates are often denoted by the letters ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'' (or ''x'', ''y'', and ''z''), in which case the lines are called the ''X''-, ''Y''-, and ''Z''-axis, respectively.  Then the coordinate planes can be referred to as the ''XY''-, ''YZ''-, and ''XZ''-planes.

In mathematics, physics, and engineering contexts, the first two axes are often defined or depicted as horizontal, with the third axis pointing up.   In that case the third coordinate may be called ''height'' or ''altitude''.  The orientations are usually chosen so that the 90 degree angle from the first axis to the second axis looks counter-clockwise when seen from the point {{nowrap|(0,0,1)}}; a convention that is commonly called ''the [[right hand rule]]''.

[[File:Cartesian coordinate surfaces.png|thumb|240px|right| The [[Coordinate system#Coordinate surface|coordinate surfaces]] of the Cartesian coordinates {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}}.  The ''z''-axis is vertical and the ''x''-axis is highlighted in green.  Thus, the red plane shows the points with {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 1}}, the blue plane shows the points with {{nowrap|1=''z'' = 1}}, and the yellow plane shows the points with {{nowrap|1=''y'' = −1}}. The three surfaces intersect at the point ''P'' (shown as a black sphere) with the Cartesian coordinates {{nowrap|(1, −1, 1}}).]]

===Higher dimensions===
A [[Euclidean plane]] with a chosen Cartesian system is called a '''Cartesian plane'''.  Since Cartesian coordinates are unique and non-ambiguous, the points of a Cartesian plane can be identified with pairs of [[real number]]s; that is with the [[Cartesian product]] &lt;math&gt;\R^2 = \R\times\R&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all reals.  In the same way, the points in any [[Euclidean space]] of dimension ''n''  be identified with the [[tuple]]s (lists) of ''n'' real numbers, that is, with the Cartesian product &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt;.

===Generalizations===
The concept of Cartesian coordinates generalizes to allow axes that are not perpendicular to each other, and/or different units along each axis.  In that case, each coordinate is obtained by projecting the point onto one axis along a direction that is parallel to the other axis (or, in general, to the [[hyperplane]] defined by all the other axes). In such an '''oblique coordinate system''' the computations of distances and angles must be modified from that in standard Cartesian systems, and many standard formulas (such as the Pythagorean formula for the distance) do not hold (see [[affine plane]]).

==Notations and conventions==&lt;!-- [[Abscissa]] redirects here --&gt;

The Cartesian coordinates of a point are usually written in [[parentheses]] and separated by commas, as in {{nowrap|(10, 5)}} or {{nowrap|(3, 5, 7)}}.  The origin is often labelled with the capital letter ''O''. In analytic geometry, unknown or generic coordinates are often denoted by the letters (''x'', ''y'') in the plane, and (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') in three-dimensional space. This custom comes from a convention of algebra, which uses letters near the end of the alphabet for unknown values (such as were the coordinates of points in many geometric problems), and letters near the beginning for given quantities.

These conventional names are often used in other domains, such as physics and engineering, although other letters may be used.  For example, in a graph showing how a [[pressure]] varies with [[time]], the graph coordinates may be denoted ''p'' and ''t''.  Each axis is usually named after the coordinate which is measured along it; so one says the ''x-axis'', the ''y-axis'', the ''t-axis'', etc.

Another common convention for coordinate naming is to use subscripts, as (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) for the ''n'' coordinates in an ''n''-dimensional space, especially when ''n'' is greater than 3 or unspecified.  Some authors prefer the numbering (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;).  These notations are especially advantageous in [[computer programming]]: by storing the coordinates of a point as an [[Array data type|array]], instead of a [[record (computer science)|record]], the [[subscript]] can serve to index the coordinates.

In mathematical illustrations of two-dimensional Cartesian systems, the first coordinate (traditionally called the [[abscissa]]) is measured along a [[horizontal plane|horizontal]] axis, oriented from left to right.  The second coordinate (the [[ordinate]]) is then measured along a [[vertical direction|vertical]] axis, usually oriented from bottom to top. Young children learning the Cartesian system, commonly learn the order to read the values before cementing the ''x''-, ''y''-, and ''z''-axis concepts, by starting with 2D mnemonics (e.g. 'Walk along the hall then up the stairs' akin to straight across the ''x''-axis then up vertically along the ''y''-axis).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/Charts_and_Diagrams.htm|title=Charts and Graphs: Choosing the Right Format|website=www.mindtools.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer graphics and [[image processing]], however, often use a coordinate system with the ''y''-axis oriented downwards on the computer display. This convention developed in the 1960s (or earlier) from the way that images were originally stored in [[framebuffer|display buffers]].

For three-dimensional systems, a convention is to portray the ''xy''-plane horizontally, with the ''z''-axis added to represent height (positive up). Furthermore, there is a convention to orient the ''x''-axis toward the viewer, biased either to the right or left.  If a diagram ([[3D projection]] or [[Perspective (graphical)|2D perspective drawing]]) shows the ''x''- and ''y''-axis horizontally and vertically, respectively, then the ''z''-axis should be shown pointing "out of the page" towards the viewer or camera. In such a 2D diagram of a 3D coordinate system, the ''z''-axis would appear as a line or ray pointing down and to the left or down and to the right, depending on the presumed viewer or camera [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. In any diagram or display, the orientation of the three axes, as a whole, is arbitrary. However, the orientation of the axes relative to each other should always comply with the [[right-hand rule]], unless specifically stated otherwise. All laws of physics and math assume this [[#Orientation and handedness|right-handedness]], which ensures consistency.

For 3D diagrams, the names "abscissa" and "ordinate" are rarely used for ''x'' and ''y'', respectively. When they are, the ''z''-coordinate is sometimes called the '''applicate'''. The words ''abscissa'', ''ordinate'' and ''applicate'' are sometimes used to refer to coordinate axes rather than the coordinate values.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Cartesian_orthogonal_coordinate_system|title=Cartesian orthogonal coordinate system|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclopedia of Mathematics|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quadrants and octants===
{{Main article|octant (solid geometry)|quadrant (plane geometry)}}
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Heraldry]] and from [[Quadrant (Cartesian coordinate system)]]--&gt;
[[File:Cartesian coordinates 2D.svg|thumb|240px|The four quadrants of a Cartesian coordinate system]]
The axes of a two-dimensional Cartesian system divide the plane into four infinite regions, called '''quadrants''',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; each bounded by two half-axes. These are often numbered from 1st to 4th and denoted by [[Roman numeral]]s: I (where the signs of the two coordinates are I (+,+), II (−,+), III (−,−), and IV (+,−).  When the axes are drawn according to the mathematical custom, the numbering goes [[clockwise|counter-clockwise]] starting from the upper right ("north-east") quadrant.

Similarly, a three-dimensional Cartesian system defines a division of space into eight regions or '''octants''',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; according to the signs of the coordinates of the points.  The convention used for naming a specific octant is to list its signs, e.g. {{nowrap|(+ + +)}} or {{nowrap|(− + −)}}. The generalization of the quadrant and octant to an arbitrary number of dimensions is the '''[[orthant]]''', and a similar naming system applies.

==Cartesian formulae for the plane==

===Distance between two points===
The [[Euclidean distance]] between two points of the plane with Cartesian coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x_1, y_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x_2, y_2)&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;d = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the Cartesian version of [[Pythagoras's theorem]].  In three-dimensional space, the distance between points &lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_1,z_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x_2,y_2,z_2)&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;d = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2+ (z_2-z_1)^2} ,&lt;/math&gt;

which can be obtained by two consecutive applications of Pythagoras' theorem.&lt;ref name="Hughes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hughes-Hallett|first1=Deborah|last2=McCallum|first2=William G.|last3=Gleason|first3=Andrew M.|title=Calculus : Single and Multivariable|date=2013|publisher=John wiley|isbn=978-0470-88861-2|edition=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Euclidean transformations===
The [[Euclidean plane isometry|Euclidean transformations]] or '''Euclidean motions''' are the ([[bijective]]) mappings of points of the [[Euclidean plane]] to themselves which preserve distances between points. There are four types of these mappings (also called isometries): [[Translation (geometry)|translations]], [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotations]], [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflections]] and [[glide reflection]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smart|1998|loc=Chap. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Translation====
[[Translation (geometry)|Translating]] a set of points of the plane, preserving the distances and directions between them, is equivalent to adding a fixed pair of numbers {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}} to the Cartesian coordinates of every point in the set.  That is, if the original coordinates of a point are {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}}, after the translation they will be

:&lt;math&gt;(x', y') = (x + a, y + b) .&lt;/math&gt;

====Rotation====
To [[rotation (geometry)|rotate]] a figure [[clockwise|counterclockwise]] around the origin by some angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to replacing every point with coordinates (''x'',''y'') by the point with coordinates  (''x&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'',''y&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''), where

:&lt;math&gt;x'=x \cos \theta - y \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y'=x \sin \theta + y \cos \theta .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus:

&lt;math&gt;(x',y') = ((x \cos \theta - y \sin \theta\,) , (x \sin \theta + y \cos \theta\,)) .&lt;/math&gt;

====Reflection====
If {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}} are the Cartesian coordinates of a point, then {{nowrap|(−''x'', ''y'')}} are the coordinates of its [[coordinate rotations and reflections|reflection]] across the second coordinate axis (the y-axis), as if that line were a mirror.  Likewise, {{nowrap|(''x'', −''y'')}} are the coordinates of its reflection across the first coordinate axis (the x-axis). In more generality, reflection across a line through the origin making an angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; with the x-axis, is equivalent to replacing every point with coordinates {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}} by the point with coordinates {{nowrap|(''x''′,''y''′)}}, where

:&lt;math&gt;x'=x \cos 2\theta + y \sin 2\theta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y'=x \sin 2\theta - y \cos 2\theta .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus:
&lt;math&gt;(x',y') = ((x \cos 2\theta + y \sin 2\theta\,) , (x \sin 2\theta - y \cos 2\theta\,)) .&lt;/math&gt;

====Glide reflection====
A glide reflection is the composition of a reflection across a line followed by a translation in the direction of that line. It can be seen that the order of these operations does not matter (the translation can come first, followed by the reflection).

====General matrix form of the transformations====
These [[Euclidean transformation]]s of the plane can all be described in a uniform way by using matrices.  The result &lt;math&gt;(x', y')&lt;/math&gt; of applying a Euclidean transformation to a point &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;(x',y') = (x,y) A + b&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is a 2×2 orthogonal [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] and {{nowrap|1=''b'' = (''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is an arbitrary ordered pair of numbers;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brannan|Esplen|Gray|1998|loc=pg. 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is,

:&lt;math&gt;x' = x A_{1 1} + y A_{2 1} + b_{1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y' = x A_{1 2} + y A_{2 2} + b_{2},&lt;/math&gt;

where

::&lt;math&gt;A =  \begin{pmatrix} A_{11} &amp; A_{12} \\ A_{21} &amp; A_{22} \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Note the use of row vectors for point coordinates and that the matrix is written on the right.&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

To be ''orthogonal'', the matrix ''A'' must have [[orthogonal]] rows with same Euclidean length of one, that is,

:&lt;math&gt;A_{1 1} A_{2 1} + A_{1 2} A_{2 2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;A_{1 1}^2 + A_{1 2}^2 = A_{2 1}^2 + A_{2 2}^2 = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

This is equivalent to saying that ''A'' times its [[transpose]] must be the [[identity matrix]].  If these conditions do not hold, the formula describes a more general [[affine transformation]] of the plane provided that the [[determinant]] of ''A'' is not zero.

The formula defines a translation [[if and only if]] ''A'' is the [[identity matrix]].  The transformation is a rotation around some point if and only if ''A'' is a [[rotation matrix]], meaning that

:&lt;math&gt; A_{1 1} A_{2 2} - A_{2 1} A_{1 2} = 1 .&lt;/math&gt;

A reflection or glide reflection is obtained when,

:&lt;math&gt; A_{1 1} A_{2 2} - A_{2 1} A_{1 2} = -1 .&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming that translation is not used transformations can be combined by simply multiplying the associated transformation matrices.

====Affine transformation====
Another way to represent coordinate transformations in Cartesian coordinates is through [[affine transformation]]s. In affine transformations an extra dimension is added and all points are given a value of 1 for this extra dimension. The advantage of doing this is that point translations can be specified in the final column of matrix ''A''.  In this way, all of the euclidean transformations become transactable as matrix point multiplications. The affine transformation is given by:

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} A_{11} &amp; A_{21} &amp; b_{1} \\ A_{12} &amp; A_{22} &amp; b_{2} \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} x' \\ y' \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Note the matrix ''A'' from above was transposed. The matrix is on the left and column vectors for point coordinates are used.&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
Using affine transformations multiple different euclidean transformations including translation can be combined by simply multiplying the corresponding matrices.

====Scaling====
An example of an affine transformation which is not a Euclidean motion is given by scaling. To make a figure larger or smaller is equivalent to multiplying the Cartesian coordinates of every point by the same positive number ''m''. If {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}} are the coordinates of a point on the original figure, the corresponding point on the scaled figure has coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;(x',y') = (m x, m y).&lt;/math&gt;

If ''m'' is greater than 1, the figure becomes larger; if ''m'' is between 0 and 1, it becomes smaller.

====Shearing====
A [[shear mapping|shearing transformation]] will push the top of a square sideways to form a parallelogram. Horizontal shearing is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;(x',y') = (x+y s, y)&lt;/math&gt;

Shearing can also be applied vertically:

:&lt;math&gt;(x',y') = (x, x s+y)&lt;/math&gt;

==Orientation and handedness==
{{Main article|orientation (mathematics)}}
{{See also|right-hand rule|axes conventions}}

===In two dimensions===
[[File:Rechte-hand-regel.jpg|left|thumb|The [[right-hand rule]] ]]
Fixing or choosing the ''x''-axis determines the ''y''-axis up to direction.  Namely, the ''y''-axis is necessarily the [[perpendicular]] to the ''x''-axis through the point marked 0 on the ''x''-axis.  But there is a choice of which of the two half lines on the perpendicular to designate as positive and which as negative.  Each of these two choices determines a different orientation (also called ''handedness'') of the Cartesian plane.

The usual way of orienting the axes, with the positive ''x''-axis pointing right and the positive ''y''-axis pointing up (and the ''x''-axis being the "first" and the ''y''-axis the "second" axis) is considered the ''positive'' or ''standard'' orientation, also called the ''right-handed'' orientation.

A commonly used mnemonic for defining the positive orientation is the ''[[right-hand rule]]''. Placing a somewhat closed right hand on the plane with the thumb pointing up, the fingers point from the ''x''-axis to the ''y''-axis, in a positively oriented coordinate system.

The other way of orienting the axes is following the ''left hand rule'', placing the left hand on the plane with the thumb pointing up.

When pointing the thumb away from the origin along an axis towards positive, the curvature of the fingers indicates a positive rotation along that axis.

Regardless of the rule used to orient the axes, rotating the coordinate system will preserve the orientation.  Switching any two axes will reverse the orientation, but switching both will leave the orientation unchanged.

===In three dimensions===
[[File:Cartesian coordinate system handedness.svg|left|200px|thumb|Fig. 7 – The left-handed orientation is shown on the left, and the right-handed on the right.]]
[[File:Right hand cartesian.svg|right|thumb|200px|Fig. 8 – The right-handed Cartesian coordinate system indicating the coordinate planes.]]

Once the ''x''- and ''y''-axes are specified, they determine the [[line (geometry)|line]] along which the ''z''-axis should lie, but there are two possible directions on this line.  The two possible coordinate systems which result are called 'right-handed' and 'left-handed'.  The standard orientation, where the ''xy''-plane is horizontal and the ''z''-axis points up (and the ''x''- and the ''y''-axis form a positively oriented two-dimensional coordinate system in the ''xy''-plane if observed from ''above'' the ''xy''-plane) is called '''right-handed''' or '''positive'''.

[[File:3D Cartesian Coodinate Handedness.jpg|thumb|3D Cartesian coordinate handedness]]

The name derives from the [[right-hand rule]]. If the [[index finger]] of the right hand is pointed forward, the [[middle finger]] bent inward at a right angle to it, and the [[thumb]] placed at a right angle to both, the three fingers indicate the relative directions of the ''x''-, ''y''-, and ''z''-axes in a ''right-handed'' system.  The thumb indicates the ''x''-axis, the index finger the ''y''-axis and the middle finger the ''z''-axis.  Conversely, if the same is done with the left hand, a left-handed system results.

Figure 7 depicts a left and a right-handed coordinate system.  Because a three-dimensional object is represented on the two-dimensional screen, distortion and ambiguity result. The axis pointing downward (and to the right) is also meant to point ''towards'' the observer, whereas the "middle"-axis is meant to point ''away'' from the observer.  The red circle is ''parallel'' to the horizontal ''xy''-plane and indicates rotation from the ''x''-axis to the ''y''-axis (in both cases).  Hence the red arrow passes ''in front of'' the ''z''-axis.

Figure 8 is another attempt at depicting a right-handed coordinate system. Again, there is an ambiguity caused by projecting the three-dimensional coordinate system into the plane. Many observers see Figure 8 as "flipping in and out" between a [[wikt:convex|convex]] cube and a [[wikt:concave|concave]] "corner".  This corresponds to the two possible orientations of the coordinate system.  Seeing the figure as convex gives a left-handed coordinate system.  Thus the "correct" way to view Figure 8 is to imagine the ''x''-axis as pointing ''towards'' the observer and thus seeing a concave corner.

==Representing a vector in the standard basis==
A point in space in a Cartesian coordinate system may also be represented by a position [[Euclidean vector|vector]], which can be thought of as an arrow pointing from the origin of the coordinate system to the point.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brannan|Esplen|Gray|1998|loc=Appendix 2, pp. 377–382}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the coordinates represent spatial positions (displacements), it is common to represent the vector from the origin to the point of interest as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;. In two dimensions, the vector from the origin to the point with Cartesian coordinates (x, y) can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r} = x \mathbf{i} + y \mathbf{j} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{j} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; are [[unit vectors]] in the direction of the ''x''-axis and ''y''-axis respectively, generally referred to as the ''[[standard basis]]'' (in some application areas these may also be referred to as [[versor]]s). Similarly, in three dimensions, the vector from the origin to the point with Cartesian coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; can be written as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = David J. Griffiths | title = Introduction to Electrodynamics | publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1999|isbn= 978-0-13-805326-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r} = x \mathbf{i} + y \mathbf{j} + z \mathbf{k} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector in the direction of the z-axis.

There is no ''natural'' interpretation of multiplying vectors to obtain another vector that works in all dimensions, however there is a way to use [[complex number]]s to provide such a multiplication. In a two dimensional cartesian plane, identify the point with coordinates {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}} with the complex number {{nowrap|1=''z'' = ''x'' + '''i'''''y''}}. Here, '''i''' is the [[imaginary unit]] and is identified with the point with coordinates {{nowrap|(0, 1)}}, so it is '''not''' the unit vector in the direction of the ''x''-axis. Since the complex numbers can be multiplied giving another complex number, this identification provides a means to "multiply" vectors. In a three dimensional cartesian space a similar identification can be made with a subset of the [[quaternion]]s.

==Applications==
Cartesian coordinates are an abstraction that have a multitude of possible applications in the real world.  However, three constructive steps are involved in superimposing coordinates on a problem application.  1) Units of distance must be decided defining the spatial size represented by the numbers used as coordinates.  2) An origin must be assigned to a specific spatial location or landmark, and 3) the orientation of the axes must be defined using available directional cues for all but one axis.

Consider as an example superimposing 3D Cartesian coordinates over all points on the Earth (i.e. geospatial 3D). What units make sense?   Kilometers are a good choice, since the original definition of the kilometer was geospatial...10&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;km equalling the surface distance from the Equator to the North Pole. Where to place the origin?  Based on symmetry, the gravitational center of the Earth suggests a natural landmark (which can be sensed via satellite orbits).  Finally, how to orient X-, Y- and Z-axis directions?   The axis of Earth's spin provides a natural direction strongly associated with "up vs. down", so positive Z can adopt the direction from geocenter to North Pole. A location on the Equator is needed to define the X-axis, and the [[prime meridian]] stands out as a reference direction, so the X-axis takes the direction from geocenter out to [ 0 degrees longitude, 0 degrees latitude ]. Note that with 3 dimensions, and two perpendicular axes directions pinned down for X and Z, the Y-axis is determined by the first two choices.  In order to obey the right-hand rule, the Y-axis must point out from the geocenter to  [ 90 degrees longitude, 0 degrees latitude ]. So what are the geocentric coordinates of the Empire State Building in New York City?   Using [ longitude = −73.985656, latitude = 40.748433 ], Earth radius = 40,000/2π, and transforming from spherical --&gt; Cartesian coordinates, you can estimate the geocentric coordinates of the Empire State Building, [ ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' ] = [ 1330.53&amp;nbsp;km, –4635.75&amp;nbsp;km, 4155.46&amp;nbsp;km ].  GPS navigation relies on such geocentric coordinates.

In engineering projects, agreement on the definition of coordinates is a crucial foundation.  One cannot assume that coordinates come predefined for a novel application, so knowledge of how to erect a coordinate system where there is none is essential to applying René Descartes' ingenious thinking.

While spatial apps employ identical units along all axes, in business and scientific apps, each axis may have different [[units of measurement]] associated with it (such as kilograms, seconds, pounds, etc.).  Although four- and higher-dimensional spaces are difficult to visualize, the algebra of Cartesian coordinates can be extended relatively easily to four or more variables, so that certain calculations involving many variables can be done.  (This sort of algebraic extension is what is used to define the geometry of higher-dimensional spaces.)  Conversely, it is often helpful to use the geometry of Cartesian coordinates in two or three dimensions to visualize algebraic relationships between two or three of many non-spatial variables.

The [[graph of a function]] or [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] is the set of all points satisfying that function or relation. For a function of one variable, ''f'', the set of all points {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}}, where {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} is the graph of the function ''f''. For a function ''g'' of two variables, the set of all points {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}}, where {{nowrap|1=''z'' = ''g''(''x'', ''y'')}} is the graph of the function ''g''. A sketch of the graph of such a function or relation would consist of all the salient parts of the function or relation which would include its relative extrema, its concavity and points of inflection, any points of discontinuity and its end behavior. All of these terms are more fully defined in calculus. Such graphs are useful in calculus to understand the nature and behavior of a function or relation.

'''Cognitive bias mitigation''' is the prevention and reduction of the negative effects of [[cognitive bias]]es – unconscious, automatic influences on human judgment and decision making that reliably produce reasoning errors.

Coherent, comprehensive theories of cognitive bias mitigation are lacking. This article describes debiasing tools, methods, proposals and other initiatives, in academic and professional disciplines concerned with the efficacy of human reasoning, associated with the concept of cognitive bias mitigation; most address mitigation tacitly rather than explicitly.

A long-standing debate regarding human decision making bears on the development of a theory and practice of bias mitigation. This debate contrasts the [[rational agent|rational economic agent]] standard for decision making versus one grounded in human social needs and motivations. The debate also contrasts the methods used to analyze and predict human decision making, i.e. formal analysis emphasizing intellectual capacities versus [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristics]] emphasizing emotional states. This article identifies elements relevant to this debate.

== Real-world effects of cognitive bias ==
There are few studies explicitly linking cognitive biases to real-world incidents with highly negative outcomes. Examples:
* One study&lt;ref&gt;Roberto, M. A. (2002). "Lessons from Everest: The Interaction of Cognitive Bias, Psychological, Safety and System Complexity." California Management Review (2002) 45(1): 136–158.&lt;/ref&gt; explicitly focused on cognitive bias as a potential contributor to a disaster-level event; this study examined the causes of the loss of several members of two expedition teams on [[1996 Mount Everest disaster|Mount Everest on two consecutive days in 1996]]. This study concluded that several cognitive biases were 'in play' on the mountain, along with other human dynamics. This was a case of highly trained, experienced people breaking their own rules, apparently under the influence of the [[overconfidence effect]], the [[sunk cost fallacy]], the [[availability heuristic]], and perhaps other cognitive biases. Five people, including both expedition leaders, lost their lives despite explicit warnings in briefings prior to and during the ascent of Everest. In addition to the leaders' mistakes, most team members, though they recognized their leader's faulty judgments, failed to insist on following through on the established ascent rules.
*In a 2010 ''MarketBeat'' study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knauff | first1 = M. | last2 = Budeck | first2 = C. | last3 = Wolf | first3 = A. G. | last4 = Hamburger | first4 = K. | year = 2010 | title = The Illogicality of Stock-Brokers: Psychological Experiments on the Effects of Prior Knowledge and Belief Biases on Logical Reasoning in Stock Trading | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 5 | issue = 10| page = e13483 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0013483 | pmid=20976157 | pmc=2956684}}&lt;/ref&gt; German researchers examined the role that certain [[cognitive bias]]es may have had in the global financial crisis beginning in 2007. Their conclusion was that the expertise level of stock analysts and traders made them highly resistant to signals that did not conform to their beliefs in the continuation of the status quo. In the grip of strong [[confirmation bias]] reinforced by the overconfidence effect and the [[status quo bias]], they apparently could not see the signals of financial collapse, even after they had become evident to non-experts.
*Similarly, [[Daniel Kahneman|Kahneman]], a Nobel Laureate in Economics, reports&lt;ref name="KahnTFS"&gt;Kahneman, D. (2011). Thinking, Fast and Slow, Doubleday Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; in a peer-reviewed study that highly experienced financial managers performed 'no better than chance', largely due to similar factors as reported in the study above, which he termed the "illusion of skill".

There are numerous investigations of incidents determining that [[human error]] was central to highly negative potential or actual real-world outcomes, in which manifestation of [[cognitive bias]]es is a plausible component. Examples:
* '''The '[[Gimli Glider]]' Incident''',&lt;ref&gt;ID=19830723-0 (1983). "Gimli Glider Accident Report." Aviation Safety Network http://aviation-safety.net&lt;/ref&gt; in which a July 23, 1983 Air Canada flight from Montreal to Edmonton ran out of fuel 41,000 feet over Manitoba because of a measurement error on refueling, an outcome later determined to be the result of a series of unchecked assumptions made by ground personnel. Without power to operate radio, radar or other navigation aids, and only manual operation of the aircraft's control surfaces, the flight crew managed to locate an abandoned Canadian Air Force landing strip near Gimli, Manitoba. Without engine power, and with only manual wheel braking, the pilot put the aircraft down, complete with 61 passengers plus crew, and safely brought it to a stop. This outcome was the result of skill (the pilot had glider experience) and luck (the co-pilot just happened to know about the airstrip); no lives were lost, the damage to the aircraft was modest, and there were knowledgeable survivors to inform modifications to fueling procedures at all Canadian airports.
* '''The Loss of the [[Mars Climate Orbiter]]''',&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, Arthur G.; LaPiana, Lia S.; Mulville, Daniel R.; Rutledge, Peter J.; Bauer, Frank H.; Folta, David; Dukeman, Greg A.; Sackheim, Robert et al (1999-11-10). "Mars Climate Orbiter Mishap Investigation Board Phase I Report." National Air and Space Administration.&lt;/ref&gt; which on September 23, 1999 "encountered Mars at an improperly low altitude" and was lost. [[NASA]] described the systemic cause of this mishap as an organizational failure, with the specific, proximate cause being unchecked assumptions across mission teams regarding the mix of [[Metric units|metric]] and [[United States customary units]] used in different systems on the craft. A host of cognitive biases can be imagined in this situation: [[confirmation bias]], [[hindsight bias]], overconfidence effect, availability bias, and even the meta-bias [[bias blind spot]].
* '''The [[Sullivan Mine]] Incident'''&lt;ref&gt;British Columbia Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources: Sullivan Mine Accident Report, May 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; of May 18, 2006, in which two mining professionals and two paramedics at the closed Sullivan mine in British Columbia, Canada, all specifically trained in safety measures, lost their lives by failing to understand a life-threatening situation that in hindsight was obvious. The first person to succumb failed to accurately discern an [[:wikt:anoxic|anoxic]] environment at the bottom of a sump within a sampling shed, accessed by a ladder. After the first fatality, three other co-workers, all trained in hazardous operational situations, one after the other lost their lives in exactly the same manner, each apparently discounting the evidence of the previous victims' fate. The power of confirmation bias alone would be sufficient to explain why this happened, but other cognitive biases probably manifested as well.
* '''The [[London Ambulance Service]] Failures''', in which several Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system failures resulted in out-of-specification service delays and reports of deaths attributed to these delays. A 1992 system failure was particularly impactful, with service delays of up to 11 hours resulting in an estimated 30 unnecessary deaths in addition to hundreds of delayed medical procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Beynon-Davies, P., "Information systems `failure': case of the LASCAD project", European Journal of Information Systems, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; This incident is one example of how large computer system development projects exhibit major flaws in planning, design, execution, test, deployment and maintenance.&lt;ref name="SW1"&gt;Mann, C.

* [[Atul Gawande]], an accomplished professional in the medical field, recounts&lt;ref name="Gawande"&gt;Gawande, A. (2010). [[The Checklist Manifesto]]: How to Get Things Right. New York, NY, Metropolitan Books.&lt;/ref&gt; the results of an initiative at a major US hospital, in which a test run showed that doctors skipped at least one of only 5 steps in 1/3 of certain surgery cases, after which nurses were given the authority and responsibility to catch doctors missing any steps in a simple checklist aimed at reducing central line infections. In the subsequent 15-month period, infection rates went from 11% to 0%, 8 deaths were avoided and some $2 million in avoidable costs were saved.
* Other disaster-level examples of negative outcomes resulting from human error, possibly including multiple cognitive biases: the [[Three Mile Island]] nuclear meltdown, the loss of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger]], the [[Chernobyl]] nuclear reactor fire, the downing of an [[Iran Air Flight 655|Iran Air]] passenger aircraft, the ineffective response to the [[Hurricane Katrina]] weather event, and many more.

Each of the [[List of cognitive biases|approximately 100 cognitive biases known to date]] can also produce negative outcomes in our everyday lives, though rarely as serious as in the examples above. An illustrative selection, recounted in multiple studies:&lt;ref name="psyc1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psyc2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psyc3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psyc4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psyc5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psyc6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psyc7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psyc8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psyc9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psyc10"/&gt;
* '''[[Confirmation bias]]''', the tendency to seek out only that information that supports one's preconceptions, and to discount that which does not. For example, hearing only one side of a political debate, or, failing to accept the evidence that one's job has become redundant.
* '''[[Framing effect (psychology)|Framing effect]]''', the tendency to react to how information is framed, beyond its factual content. For example, choosing no surgery when told it has a 10% failure rate, where one would have opted for surgery if told it has a 90% success rate, or, opting not to choose organ donation as part of driver's license renewal when the default is 'No'.
* '''[[Anchoring bias]]''', the tendency to produce an estimate near a cue amount that may or may not have been intentionally offered. For example, producing a quote based on a manager's preferences, or, negotiating a house purchase price from the starting amount suggested by a real estate agent rather than an objective assessment of value.
* '''[[Gambler's fallacy]]''' (aka [[Sunk cost|sunk cost bias]]), the failure to reset one's expectations based on one's current situation. For example, refusing to pay again to purchase a replacement for a lost ticket to a desired entertainment, or, refusing to sell a sizable long stock position in a rapidly falling market.
* '''[[Representativeness heuristic]]''', the tendency to judge something as belonging to a class based on a few salient characteristics without accounting for base rates of those characteristics. For example, the belief that one will not become an alcoholic because one lacks some characteristic of an alcoholic stereotype, or, that one has a higher probability to win the lottery because one buys tickets from the same kind of vendor as several known big winners.
* '''[[Halo effect]]''', the tendency to attribute unverified capabilities in a person based on an observed capability. For example, believing an Oscar-winning actor's assertion regarding the harvest of Atlantic seals, or, assuming that a tall, handsome man is intelligent and kind.
* '''[[Hindsight bias]]''', the tendency to assess one's previous decisions as more efficacious than they were. For example, 'recalling' one's prediction that Vancouver would lose the 2011 Stanley Cup, or, 'remembering' to have identified the proximate cause of the 2007 Great Recession.
* '''[[Availability heuristic]]''', the tendency to estimate that what is easily remembered is more likely than that which is not. For example, estimating that an information meeting on municipal planning will be boring because the last such meeting you attended (on a different topic) was so, or, not believing your Member of Parliament's promise to fight for women's equality because he didn't show up to your home bake sale fundraiser for him.
* '''[[Bandwagon effect]]''', the tendency to do or believe what others do or believe. For example, voting for a political candidate because your father unfailingly voted for that candidate's party, or, not objecting to a bully's harassment because the rest of your peers don't.

== To date ==
An increasing number of academic and professional disciplines are identifying means of cognitive bias mitigation. Notable examples in the field of '''[[debiasing]]''', is a model by the [http://www.neuroleadership.com NeuroLeadership Institute] that categorizes over 150 known cognitive biases into a decision-making framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lieberman|first1=Matthew|last2=Rock|first2=David|last3=Grant Halvorson|first3=Heidi|last4=Cox|first4=Christine|title=Breaking Bias Updated: The SEEDS Model(tm)|journal=NeuroLeadership Journal|date=November 2015|volume=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What follows is a characterization of the assumptions, theories, methods and results, in disciplines concerned with the efficacy of human reasoning, that plausibly bear on a theory and/or practice of cognitive bias mitigation. In most cases this is based on explicit reference to [[cognitive bias]]es or their mitigation, in others on unstated but self-evident applicability. This characterization is organized along lines reflecting historical segmentation of disciplines, though in practice there is a significant amount of overlap.

=== Decision theory ===
[[Decision theory]], a discipline with its roots grounded in neo-classical [[economics]], is explicitly focused on human reasoning, judgment, choice and decision making, primarily in 'one-shot games' between two agents with or without perfect information. The theoretical underpinning of decision theory assumes that all decision makers are [[rational agents]] trying to maximize the economic [[expected value|expected value/utility]] of their choices, and that to accomplish this they utilize formal analytical methods such as mathematics, probability, statistics, and logic under cognitive resource constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kahneman | first1 = D. | last2 = Thaler | first2 = R. | year = 2006 | title = Utility Maximization and Experienced Utility | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 221–234 | doi=10.1257/089533006776526076}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frey, B.; Stutzer, A. (2002). "What Can Economists Learn from Happiness Research?". Journal of Economic Literature. 40 (2): 402–35. doi:10.1257/002205102320161320&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kahneman, D. (2000). "Experienced Utility and Objective Happiness: A Moment-Based Approach." Chapter 37 in: D. Kahneman and A. Tversky (Eds.) "Choices, Values and Frames." New York: Cambridge University Press and the Russell Sage Foundation, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Normative, or prescriptive, decision theory concerns itself with what people ''should'' do, given the goal of maximizing expected value/utility; in this approach there is no explicit representation in practitioners' models of unconscious factors such as cognitive biases, i.e. all factors are considered conscious choice parameters for all agents. Practitioners tend to treat deviations from what a rational agent would do as 'errors of irrationality', with the implication that cognitive bias mitigation can only be achieved by decision makers becoming more like rational agents, though no explicit measures for achieving this are proffered.

Positive, or descriptive, decision theory concerns itself with what people ''actually'' do; practitioners tend to acknowledge the persistent existence of 'irrational' behavior, and while some mention human motivation and biases as possible contributors to such behavior, these factors are not made explicit in their models. Practitioners tend to treat deviations from what a rational agent would do as evidence of important, but as yet not understood, decision-making variables, and have as yet no explicit or implicit contributions to make to a theory and practice of cognitive bias mitigation.

=== Game theory ===
[[Game theory]], a discipline with roots in economics and [[system dynamics]], is a method of studying strategic decision making in situations involving multi-step interactions with multiple agents with or without perfect information. As with decision theory, the theoretical underpinning of game theory assumes that all decision makers are rational agents trying to maximize the economic expected value/utility of their choices, and that to accomplish this they utilize formal analytical methods such as mathematics, probability, statistics, and logic under cognitive resource constraints.&lt;ref&gt;Binmore, K. (2007). "A Very Short Introduction to Game Theory." Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Camerer, C. F., Ho T.-H., Chong, J.-K. (2002). "A Cognitive Hierarchy Theory of One-Shot Games and Experimental Analysis." Forth, Quarterly Journal of Economics."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broseta, B., Costa-Gomes, M., Crawford, V. (2000). "Cognition and Behavior in Normal-Form Games: An Experimental Study." Department of Economics, University of California at San Diego, Permalink: http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/0fp8278k.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myerson, R. B. (1991). "Game Theory: Analysis of Conflict." Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

One major difference between decision theory and game theory is the notion of 'equilibrium', a situation in which all agents agree on a strategy because any deviation from this strategy punishes the deviating agent. Despite analytical proofs of the existence of at least one equilibrium in a wide range of scenarios, game theory predictions, like those in decision theory, often do not match actual human choices.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;Wright J. R., Leyton-Brown, K., Behavioral Game-Theoretic Models: A Bayesian Framework For Parameter Analysis, to appear in Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2012), (8 pages), 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As with decision theory, practitioners tend to view such deviations as 'irrational', and rather than attempt to model such behavior, by implication hold that cognitive bias mitigation can only be achieved by decision makers becoming more like rational agents.

In the full range of game theory models there are many that do not guarantee the existence of equilibria, i.e. there are conflict situations where there is no set of agents' strategies that all agents agree are in their best interests. However, even when theoretical equilibria exist, i.e. when optimal decision strategies are available for all agents, real-life decision-makers often do not find them; indeed they sometimes apparently do not even try to find them, suggesting that some agents are not consistently 'rational'. game theory does not appear to accommodate any kind of agent other than the rational agent.

=== Behavioral economics ===
Unlike neo-classical economics and decision theory, [[behavioral economics]] and the related field, [[behavioral finance]], explicitly consider the effects of social, cognitive and emotional factors on individuals' economic decisions. These disciplines combine insights from [[psychology]] and neo-classical [[Economic theory|economics]] to achieve this.&lt;ref name="BeEcon3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frey | first1 = B. | last2 = Stutzer | first2 = A. | year = 2002 | title = What Can Economists Learn from Happiness Research? | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Literature | volume = 40 | issue = 2| pages = 402–35 | doi=10.1257/002205102320161320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BeEcon1"&gt;Kahneman, D. "Maps of Bounded Rationality: Psychology for Behavioral Economics."

MIT Department of Economics Working Paper 00-27. (September 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prospect theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kahneman | first1 = D. | last2 = Tversky | first2 = A. | year = 1979 | title = Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision Under Risk | url = | journal = Econometrica | volume = 47 | issue = 2| pages = 263–291 | doi=10.2307/1914185}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an early inspiration for this discipline, and has been further developed by its practitioners. It is one of the earliest economic theories that explicitly acknowledge the notion of cognitive bias, though the model itself accounts for only a few, including [[loss aversion]], [[Anchoring|anchoring and adjustment bias]], [[endowment effect]], and perhaps others. No mention is made in formal prospect theory of cognitive bias mitigation, and there is no evidence of peer-reviewed work on cognitive bias mitigation in other areas of this discipline.

However, [[Daniel Kahneman]] and others have authored recent articles in business and trade magazines addressing the notion of cognitive bias mitigation in a limited form.&lt;ref name="KahnHBR"&gt;Kahneman, D., Lovallo, D., Sibony, O. (2011). "Before You Make That Big Decision." Harvard Business Review, June, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; These contributions assert that cognitive bias mitigation is necessary and offer general suggestions for how to achieve it, though the guidance is limited to only a few cognitive biases and is not self-evidently generalizable to others.

=== Neuroeconomics ===
[[Neuroeconomics]] is a discipline made possible by advances in brain activity imaging technologies. This discipline merges some of the ideas in [[experimental economics]], behavioral economics, [[cognitive science]] and [[social science]] in an attempt to better understand the neural basis for human decision making.

[[fMRI]] experiments suggest that the [[limbic system]] is consistently involved in resolving economic decision situations that have [[Valence (psychology)|emotional valence]], the inference being that this part of the human brain is implicated in creating the deviations from rational agent choices noted in emotionally valent economic decision making. Practitioners in this discipline have demonstrated correlations between brain activity in this part of the brain and [[prospection]] activity, and neuronal activation has been shown to have measurable, consistent effects on decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Loewenstein |first1=George |last2=Rick |first2=Scott |last3=Cohen |first3=Jonathan D. |title=Neuroeconomics |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |date=January 2008 |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=647–672 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093710}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rustichini | first1 = A | year = 2009 | title = Neuroeconomics: What have we found, and what should we search for? | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 672–677 | doi=10.1016/j.conb.2009.09.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Padoa-Schioppa | first1 = C. | last2 = Assad | first2 = J.A. | year = 2007 | title = The Representation of Economic Value in the Orbitofrontal Cortex is Invariant for Changes of Menu | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 95–102 | doi=10.1038/nn2020 | pmid=18066060 | pmc=2646102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Neuro"&gt;Spreng, R.

=== Cognitive psychology ===
Several streams of investigation in this discipline are noteworthy for their possible relevance to a theory of cognitive bias mitigation.

One approach to mitigation originally suggested by [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]], expanded upon by others, and applied in real-life situations, is [[reference class forecasting]]. This approach involves three steps: with a specific project in mind, identify a number of past projects that share a large number of elements with the project under scrutiny; for this group of projects, establish a probability distribution of the parameter that is being forecast; and, compare the specific project with the group of similar projects, in order to establish the most likely value of the selected parameter for the specific project. This simply stated method masks potential complexity regarding application to real-life projects: few projects are characterizable by a single parameter; multiple parameters exponentially complicates the process; gathering sufficient data on which to build robust probability distributions is problematic; and, project outcomes are rarely unambiguous and their reportage is often skewed by stakeholders' interests. Nonetheless, this approach has merit as part of a cognitive bias mitigation protocol when the process is applied with a maximum of diligence, in situations where good data is available and all stakeholders can be expected to cooperate.

A concept rooted in considerations of the actual machinery of human reasoning, [[bounded rationality]] is one that may inform significant advances in cognitive bias mitigation. Originally conceived of by [[Herbert A. Simon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simon | first1 = H. A. | year = 1991 | title = Bounded Rationality and Organizational Learning | url = | journal = Organization Science | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 125–134 | doi=10.1287/orsc.2.1.125}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1960s and leading to the concept of [[satisficing]] as opposed to optimizing, this idea found experimental expression in the work of [[Gerd Gigerenzer]] and others. One line of Gigerenzer's work led to the "Fast and Frugal" framing of the human reasoning mechanism,&lt;ref name="Gig"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gigerenzer | first1 = G. | last2 = Goldstein | first2 = D. G. | year = 1996 | title = Reasoning the Fast and Frugal Way: Models of Bounded Rationality | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 103 | issue = 4| pages = 650–669 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.103.4.650 | pmid=8888650}}&lt;/ref&gt; which focused on the primacy of 'recognition' in decision making, backed up by tie-resolving heuristics operating in a low cognitive resource environment. In a series of objective tests, models based on this approach outperformed models based on rational agents [[Utility maximization|maximizing their utility]] using formal analytical methods. One contribution to a theory and practice of cognitive bias mitigation from this approach is that it addresses mitigation without explicitly targeting individual cognitive biases and focuses on the reasoning mechanism itself to avoid cognitive biases manifestation.

Intensive situational training is capable of providing individuals with what appears to be cognitive bias mitigation in decision making, but amounts to a fixed strategy of selecting the single best response to recognized situations regardless of the 'noise' in the environment. Studies and anecdotes reported in popular-audience media&lt;ref name="KahnTFS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawande"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gladwell, M. (2006). Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking. New York, NY, Little, Brown and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shermer, M. (2010). A review of Paul Thagard's "The Brain and the Meaning of Life". Skeptic Magazine. Altadena, CA, Skeptics Society. 16: 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; of firefighter captains, military platoon leaders and others making correct, snap judgments under extreme duress suggest that these responses are likely not generalizable and may contribute to a theory and practice of cognitive bias mitigation only the general idea of domain-specific intensive training.

Similarly, expert-level training in such foundational disciplines as mathematics, statistics, probability, logic, etc. can be useful for cognitive bias mitigation when the expected standard of performance reflects such formal analytical methods. However, a study of software engineering professionals&lt;ref name="ConKru"&gt;Conroy, P., Kruchten, P. (2012). "Performance Norms: An Approach to Reducing Rework in Software Development", to appear in IEEE Xplore re 2012 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computing Engineering.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that for the task of estimating software projects, despite the strong analytical aspect of this task, standards of performance focusing on workplace social context were much more dominant than formal analytical methods. This finding, if generalizable to other tasks and disciplines, would discount the potential of expert-level training as a cognitive bias mitigation approach, and could contribute a narrow but important idea to a theory and practice of cognitive bias mitigation.

Laboratory experiments in which cognitive bias mitigation is an explicit goal are rare. One 1980 study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weinstein | first1 = N. D. | year = 1980 | title = Unrealistic Optimism About Future Life Events". Department of Human Ecology and Social Sciences, Cook College, Rutgers, The State University | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 39 | issue = 5| pages = 806–820 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.39.5.806}}&lt;/ref&gt; explored the notion of reducing the [[optimism bias]] by showing subjects other subjects' outputs from a reasoning task, with the result that their subsequent decision-making was somewhat debiased.

A recent research effort by Morewedge and colleagues (2015) found evidence for domain-general forms of debiasing. In two longitudinal experiments, debiasing training techniques featuring interactive games that elicited six cognitive biases (anchoring, bias blind spot, confirmation bias, fundamental attribution error, projection bias, and representativeness), provided participants with individualized feedback, mitigating strategies, and practice, resulted in an immediate reduction of more than 30% in commission of the biases and a long term (2 to 3-month delay) reduction of more than 20%. The instructional videos were also effective, but were less effective than the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morewedge|first1=C. K.|last2=Yoon|first2=H.|last3=Scopelliti|first3=I.|last4=Symborski|first4=C. W.|last5=Korris|first5=J. H.|last6=Kassam|first6=K.

=== Evolutionary psychology ===
This discipline explicitly challenges the prevalent view that humans are rational agents maximizing expected value/utility, using formal analytical methods to do so. Practitioners such as [[Cosmides]], Tooby, Haselton, Confer and others posit that cognitive biases are more properly referred to as cognitive heuristics, and should be viewed as a toolkit of cognitive shortcuts&lt;ref name="EvPsyc1"&gt;Cosmides, L., Tooby, J.

Theoretical models and analyses supporting this view are plentiful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chudek | first1 = M. | last2 = Henrich | first2 = J. | year = 2011 | title = Culture–Gene Coevolution, Norm-Psychology and the Emergence of Human Prosociality | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume =  15| issue = | pages =  218–226| doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2011.03.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view suggests that negative reasoning outcomes arise primarily because the reasoning challenges faced by modern humans, and the social and political context within which these are presented, make demands on our ancient 'heuristic toolkit' that at best create confusion as to which heuristics to apply in a given situation, and at worst generate what adherents of the prevalent view call 'reasoning errors'.

In a similar vein, [[Hugo Mercier|Mercier]] and [[Dan Sperber|Sperber]] describe a theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mercier | first1 = H. | last2 = Sperber | first2 = D. | year = 2011 | title = Argumentative Theory | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 34 | issue = 2| pages = 57–74 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x10000968}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[confirmation bias]], and possibly other cognitive biases, which is a radical departure from the prevalent view, which holds that human reasoning is intended to assist individual economic decisions. Their view suggests that it evolved as a social phenomenon and that the goal was argumentation, i.e. to convince others and to be careful when others try to convince us. It is too early to tell whether this idea applies more generally to other cognitive biases, but the point of view supporting the theory may be useful in the construction of a theory and practice of cognitive bias mitigation.

There is an emerging convergence between [[evolutionary psychology]] and the concept of our reasoning mechanism being segregated (approximately) into 'System 1' and 'System 2'.&lt;ref name="KahnTFS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EvPsyc1"/&gt; In this view, System 1 is the 'first line' of cognitive processing of all perceptions, including internally generated 'pseudo-perceptions', which automatically, subconsciously and near-instantaneously produces emotionally valenced judgments of their probable effect on the individual's well-being. By contrast, System 2 is responsible for 'executive control', taking System 1's judgments as advisories, making future predictions, via [[prospection]], of their actualization and then choosing which advisories, if any, to act on. In this view, System 2 is slow, simple-minded and lazy, usually defaulting to System 1 advisories and overriding them only when intensively trained to do so or when cognitive dissonance would result. In this view, our 'heuristic toolkit' resides largely in System 1, conforming to the view of cognitive biases being unconscious, automatic and very difficult to detect and override. Evolutionary psychology practitioners emphasize that our heuristic toolkit, despite the apparent abundance of 'reasoning errors' attributed to it, actually performs exceptionally well, given the rate at which it must operate, the range of judgments it produces, and the stakes involved. The System 1/2 view of the human reasoning mechanism appears to have empirical plausibility (see [[#Neuroscience|Neuroscience]], next) and thus may contribute to a theory and practice of cognitive bias mitigation.

=== Neuroscience ===
[[Neuroscience]] offers empirical support for the concept of segregating the human reasoning mechanism into System 1 and System 2, as described above, based on brain activity imaging experiments using [[fMRI]] technology. While this notion must remain speculative until further work is done, it appears to be a productive basis for conceiving options for constructing a theory and practice of cognitive bias mitigation.&lt;ref name="fMRI1"&gt;Damasio, A.

These scenarios of social, political, and economic organization are not uniform throughout history or geography, but there is a degree of stability throughout the [[Paleolithic]] era, and the [[Holocene]] in particular. This, along with the findings in [[#Evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychology]] and [[#Neuroscience|Neuroscience]] above, suggests that our cognitive heuristics are at their best when operating in a social, political and economic environment most like that of the Paleolithic/Holocene. If this is true, then one possible means to achieve at least some cognitive bias mitigation is to mimic, as much as possible, Paleolithic/Holocene social, political and economic scenarios when one is performing a reasoning task that could attract negative cognitive bias effects.

=== Human reliability engineering ===
A number of paradigms, methods and tools for improving human performance reliability&lt;ref name="Gawande"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HR1"&gt;Gertman, D., Blackman, H., Marble, J., Byers, J. and Smith, C. (2005). The SPAR-H human reliability analysis method.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HR2"&gt;Hollnagel, E. (1998). Cognitive reliability and error analysis method: CREAM. Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HR3"&gt;Roth, E. et al. (1994). An empirical investigation of operator performance in cognitive demanding simulated emergencies. NUREG/CR-6208, Westinghouse Science and Technology Center. Report prepared for Nuclear Regulatory Commission.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HR4"&gt;Wiegmann, D. &amp; Shappell, S. (2003). A human error approach to aviation accident analysis: The human factors analysis and classification system.. Ashgate.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HR5"&gt;Wilson, J.R. (1993). SHEAN (Simplified Human Error Analysis code) and automated THERP. United States Department of Energy Technical Report Number WINCO–11908.&lt;/ref&gt; have been developed within the discipline of [[Human reliability|human reliability engineering]]. Although there is some attention paid to the human reasoning mechanism itself, the dominant approach is to anticipate problematic situations, constrain human operations through process mandates, and guide human decisions through fixed response protocols specific to the domain involved. While this approach can produce effective responses to critical situations under stress, the protocols involved must be viewed as having limited generalizability beyond the domain for which they were developed, with the implication that solutions in this discipline may provide only generic frameworks to a theory and practice of cognitive bias mitigation.

=== Machine learning ===
[[Machine learning]], a branch of [[artificial intelligence]], has been used to investigate human learning and decision making.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, R. S., Barto, A. G. (1998). MIT CogNet Ebook Collection; MITCogNet 1998, Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning, {{ISBN|978-0-262-19398-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One technique particularly applicable to cognitive bias mitigation is [[artificial neural network|neural network learning and choice selection]], an approach inspired by the imagined structure and function of actual [[biological neural network]]s in the [[human brain]]. The multilayer, cross-connected signal collection and propagation structure typical of [[neural network]] models, where weights govern the contribution of signals to each connection, allow very small models to perform rather complex decision-making tasks at high fidelity.

In principle, such models are capable of modeling decision making that takes account of human needs and motivations within social contexts, and suggest their consideration in a theory and practice of cognitive bias mitigation. Challenges to realizing this potential: accumulating the considerable amount of appropriate real world 'training sets' for the neural network portion of such models; characterizing real-life decision-making situations and outcomes so as to drive models effectively; and the lack of direct mapping from a neural network's internal structure to components of the human reasoning mechanism.

=== Software engineering ===
This discipline, though not focused on improving human reasoning outcomes as an end goal, is one in which the need for such improvement has been explicitly recognized,&lt;ref name="SW1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SW2"/&gt; though the term "cognitive bias mitigation" is not universally used.

One study&lt;ref&gt;Caliki, G., Bener, A., Arsian, B. (2010). "An Analysis of the Effects of Company Culture, Education and Experience on Confirmation Bias Levels of Software Developers and Testers." ADM/IEEE 32nd International Conference on Software Engineering – ICSE 2010 Volume 2: pp187-190.&lt;/ref&gt; identifies specific steps to counter the effects of [[confirmation bias]] in certain phases of the software engineering lifecycle.

Another study&lt;ref name="ConKru"/&gt; takes a step back from focussing on cognitive biases and describes a framework for identifying "Performance Norms", criteria by which reasoning outcomes are judged correct or incorrect, so as to determine when cognitive bias mitigation is required, to guide identification of the biases that may be 'in play' in a real-world situation, and subsequently to prescribe their mitigations. This study refers to a broad research program with the goal of moving toward a theory and practice of cognitive bias mitigation.

=== Other ===
Other initiatives aimed directly at a theory and practice of cognitive bias mitigation may exist within other disciplines under different labels than employed here.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="649">In [[law]], a '''comminatory''' is a [[clause]] inserted into a law, [[edict]], [[patent]], etc., describing a [[punishment]] that is to be imposed on delinquents, which, however, is not in practice executed with the rigor that is conveyed in the description, or not even executed at all.

Thus, in some countries, when an exile is enjoined not to return on pain of death, it is deemed a comminatory penalty, since, if he did return, it is not strictly executed, but instead the same threat is laid on him again, which is more than comminatory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7350">A '''contrast effect''' is the enhancement or diminishment, relative to normal, of [[perception]], [[cognition]] or related performance as a result of successive (immediately previous) or simultaneous exposure to a [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] of lesser or greater value in the same dimension. (Here, normal perception, cognition or performance is that which would be obtained in the absence of the comparison stimulus—i.e., one based on all previous experience.)

Perception example: A neutral gray target will appear lighter or darker than it does in isolation when immediately preceded by, or simultaneously compared to, respectively, a dark gray or light gray target.
Cognition example: A person will appear more or less attractive than that person does in isolation when immediately preceded by, or simultaneously compared to, respectively, a less or more attractive person.
Performance example: A laboratory rat will work faster, or slower, during a stimulus predicting a given amount of reward when that stimulus and reward are immediately preceded by, or alternated with, respectively, different stimuli associated with either a lesser or greater amount of reward.

==Types==
[[Image:Simultaneous Contrast.svg|frame|Simultaneous contrast]]
'''Simultaneous contrast''' identified by [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]] refers to the manner in which the [[color]]s of two different objects affect each other. The effect is more noticeable when shared between objects of [[complementary color]].&lt;ref&gt;''Colour, Why the World Isn't Grey'', [[Hazel Rossotti]], Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, 1985, pp. 135–136. {{ISBN|0-691-02386-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the image here, the two inner rectangles are exactly the same shade of grey, but the upper one appears to be a lighter grey than the lower one due to the background provided by the outer rectangles.

This is a different concept from ''[[contrast (vision)|contrast]]'', which by itself refers to one object's difference in color and [[luminance]] compared to its surroundings or background.

[[Image:Successive contrast.svg|frame|left|Successive contrast]]
'''Successive contrast''' occurs when the perception of currently viewed stimuli is modulated by previously viewed stimuli.

For example, staring at the dot in the center of one of the two colored disks on the top row for a few seconds and then looking at the dot in the center of the disk on the same side in the bottom row makes the two lower disks appear to have different colors for a few moments, though they have the same color.

One type of contrast that involves both time and space is '''metacontrast and paracontrast'''. When one half of a circle is lit for 10 milliseconds, it is at its maximal intensity. If the other half is displayed at the same time (but 20–50 ms later), there is a mutual inhibition: the left side is darkened by the right half (metacontrast), and the center may be completely obliterated. At the same time, there is a slight darkening of the right side due to the first stimulus; this is paracontrast.&lt;ref&gt;"Eye, human". Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008. [[Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=June 2015}}

==Domains==
The contrast effect was noted by the seventeenth century philosopher [[John Locke]], who observed that lukewarm water can feel hot or cold, depending on whether the hand touching it was previously in hot or cold water.&lt;ref name="Kushner2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kushner|first=Laura H.|title=Contrast in judgments of mental health|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYn5VHp9jioC&amp;pg=PA1|accessdate=24 March 2011|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-91314-6|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early twentieth century, [[Wilhelm Wundt]] identified contrast as a fundamental principle of perception, and since then the effect has been confirmed in many different areas.&lt;ref name="Kushner2008" /&gt; Contrast effects can shape not only visual qualities like color and brightness, but other kinds of perception, including the perception of weight.&lt;ref name="Plous1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Plous|first=Scott|title=The psychology of judgment and decision making|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xvWOQgAACAAJ|accessdate=24 March 2011|year=1993|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-050477-6|pages=38–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; One experiment found that thinking of the name "Hitler" led to subjects rating a person as more friendly.&lt;ref name="Moskowitz2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moskowitz|first=Gordon B.|title=Social cognition: understanding self and others|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_-NLW8Ynvp8C&amp;pg=PA421|accessdate=24 March 2011|year=2005|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-59385-085-2|page=421}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether a piece of music is perceived as good or bad can depend on whether the music heard before it was unpleasant or pleasant.&lt;ref name="Popper2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Arthur N.|title=Music Perception|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYXd3CF1_vkC&amp;pg=PA150|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=30 November 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4419-6113-6|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the effect to work, the objects being compared need to be similar to each other: a television reporter can seem to shrink when interviewing a tall basketball player, but not when standing next to a tall building.

For example, African countries have increasingly looked to China and India as opposed to the US, the EU and the World Bank because these Asian states have highlighted their lack of "interference" and "conditionality" in exchange for foreign aid and FDI.&lt;ref name="Ndzendze2017" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3803">'''Cosmopolitan localism''' is a [[social innovation]] approach to [[community development]] that seeks to link [[Local community|local]] and [[Global community|global]] communities through resilient infrastructures that bring [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] closer together, building on [[Distributed Systems|distributed systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/983824383|title=Designs for the pluriverse : radical interdependence, autonomy, and the making of worlds|last=1951-|first=Escobar, Arturo,|isbn=9780822370901|location=Durham|oclc=983824383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmopolitan localism fosters a global network of mutually supportive communities (neighbourhoods, villages, towns, cities and regions) who share and exchange knowledge, ideas, skills, technology, culture and (where socially and ecologically sustainable) resources. The approach seeks to foster a creative, [[reciprocal relationship]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} between the local and the global.

Italian social innovation scholar [[Ezio Manzini]] describes cosmopolitan localism as having the potential to generate a new [[sense of place]]. With cosmopolitan localism, places are not considered isolated entities, but nodes in short-distance and long-distance networks. The short-distance networks generate and regenerate the local socio-economic fabric and the long-distance networks connect a particular community to the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/904398409|title=Design, when everybody designs : an introduction to design for social innovation|last=Ezio,|first=Manzini,|isbn=9780262328630|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=904398409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6750">In [[general relativity]],  '''curvature invariants''' are a set of [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s formed from the [[Riemann tensor|Riemann]], [[Weyl tensor|Weyl]] and [[Ricci tensor|Ricci]] tensors - which represent [[curvature]], hence the name, - and possibly operations on them such as [[Tensor contraction|contraction]], [[covariant differentiation]] and [[Dual tensor|dualisation]].

Certain invariants formed from these curvature tensors play an important role in classifying [[spacetime]]s. Invariants are actually less powerful for distinguishing locally non-[[isometry|isometric]] [[Lorentzian manifold]]s than they are for distinguishing [[Riemannian manifold]]s. This means that they are more limited in their applications than for manifolds endowed with a [[positive definite]] [[metric tensor]].

==Principal invariants==

The principal invariants of the Riemann and Weyl tensors are certain [[quadratic function|quadratic]] [[polynomial]] [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (i.e., sums of squares of components).

The principal invariants of the [[Riemann tensor]] of a four-dimensional Lorentzian manifold are
#the ''[[Kretschmann scalar]]'' &lt;math&gt;K_1 = R_{abcd} \, R^{abcd}&lt;/math&gt;
#the ''Chern–Pontryagin scalar'' &lt;math&gt;K_2 = {{}^\star R}_{abcd} \, R^{abcd}&lt;/math&gt;
#the ''Euler scalar'' &lt;math&gt;K_3 = {{}^\star R^\star}_{abcd} \, R^{abcd}&lt;/math&gt;
These are quadratic polynomial invariants (sums of squares of components).  (Some authors define the Chern–Pontryagin scalar using the [[Hodge dual|right dual]] instead of the [[Hodge dual|left dual]].)

The first of these was introduced by [[Erich Kretschmann]].  The second two names are somewhat anachronistic, but since the integrals of the last two are related to the [[instanton]] number and [[Euler characteristic]] respectively, they have some justification.

The principal invariants of the [[Weyl tensor]] are
# &lt;math&gt;I_1 = C_{abcd} \, C^{abcd}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;I_2 = {{}^\star C}_{abcd} \, C^{abcd}&lt;/math&gt;
(Because &lt;math&gt;{{}^\star C^\star}_{abcd} = -C_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt;, there is no need to define a third principal invariant for the Weyl tensor.)

===Relation with Ricci decomposition===

As one might expect from the [[Ricci decomposition]] of the Riemann tensor into the Weyl tensor plus a sum of fourth-rank tensors constructed from the second rank [[Ricci tensor]] and from the [[Ricci scalar]], these two sets of invariants are related (in d=4):
:&lt;math&gt;K_1 = I_1 + 2 \, R_{ab} \, R^{ab} - \frac{1}{3} \, R^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;K_3 = -I_1 + 2 \, R_{ab} \, R^{ab} - \frac{2}{3} \, R^2&lt;/math&gt;

===Relation with Bel decomposition===

In four dimensions, the [[Bel decomposition]] of the Riemann tensor, with respect to a timelike unit vector field &lt;math&gt;\vec{X}&lt;/math&gt;, not necessarily geodesic or hypersurface orthogonal, consists of three pieces
#the ''[[electrogravitic tensor]]'' &lt;math&gt;E[\vec{X}]_{ab} = R_{ambn} \, X^m \, X^n&lt;/math&gt;
#the ''[[magnetogravitic tensor]]'' &lt;math&gt;B[\vec{X}]_{ab} = {{}^\star R}_{ambn} \, X^m \, X^n&lt;/math&gt;
#the ''[[topogravitic tensor]]'' &lt;math&gt;L[\vec{X}]_{ab} = {{}^\star R^\star}_{ambn} \, X^m \, X^n&lt;/math&gt;
Because these are all ''transverse'' (i.e. projected to the spatial hyperplane elements orthogonal to our timelike unit vector field), they can be represented as linear operators on three-dimensional vectors, or as three by three real matrices.  They are respectively symmetric, [[traceless]], and symmetric (6,8,6 linearly independent components, for a total of 20).  If we write these operators as '''E''', '''B''', '''L''' respectively, the principal invariants of the Riemann tensor are obtained as follows:
*&lt;math&gt;K_1/4&lt;/math&gt; is the trace of '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; +  '''L'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 2 '''B''' '''B'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;,
*&lt;math&gt;-K_2/8&lt;/math&gt; is the trace of '''B''' ( '''E''' - '''L''' ),
*&lt;math&gt;K_3/8&lt;/math&gt; is the trace of '''E''' '''L''' - '''B'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Expression in Newman–Penrose formalism===

In terms of the [[Weyl scalar]]s in the [[Newman–Penrose formalism]], the principal invariants of the Weyl tensor may be obtained by taking the real and imaginary parts of the expression
:&lt;math&gt;I_1 - i \, I_2 = 16 \, \left( 3 \Psi_2^2 + \Psi_0 \, \Psi_4 - 4 \, \Psi_1 \Psi_3 \right)&lt;/math&gt;
(But note the minus sign!)

The principal quadratic invariant of the [[Ricci tensor]], &lt;math&gt;R_{ab} \, R^{ab}&lt;/math&gt;, may be obtained as a more complicated expression involving the ''Ricci scalars'' (see the paper by Cherubini et al. cited below).

==Distinguishing Lorentzian manifolds==
An important question related to Curvature invariants is when the set of polynomial curvature invariants can be used to (locally) distinguish manifolds. To be able to do this is necessary to include higher-order invariants including derivatives of the Riemann tensor but in the Lorentzian case, it is known that there are spacetimes which cannot be distinguished; e.g., the [[VSI spacetimes]] for which all such curvature invariants vanish and thus cannot be distinguished from flat space. This failure of being able to distinguishing Lorentzian manifolds is related to the fact that the [[Lorentz group]] is non-compact.

There are still examples of cases when we can distinguish Lorentzian manifolds using their invariants. Examples of such are fully general [[Petrov type]] I spacetimes with no Killing vectors, see Coley ''et al.'' below. Indeed, it was here found that the spacetimes failing to be distinguished by their set of curvature invariants are all [[Kundt spacetime]]s.

The '''divine plane''' ([[hyperplane]] or [[spacetime|continuum]]/[[universe]], enclosing and interpenetrating grosser planes, respectively) is the plane in which [[Brahman]] and [[Om|Om or Aum]], i.e. [[Logos]] or [[Agathon]], i.e. (according to [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]) [[spirit]] of [[deity]] (as Brahman, Logos i.e. Agathon, etc.,) i.e. the creative Word (as the [[Pranava]] [[Om]] or Aum, Logos, [[Tohu and Tikkun|Tikkun]], etc.) and ideal, exists.  The term is from the Greek word 'Logos' and is used in the [[Arcane School]] ideas.

==Theosophical differences==

'Classical' 1800s Theosophy does not say whether this [[spiritual plane]] is the only one that has to do with Logos is human, but [[Annie Besant]] &amp; [[Charles Leadbeater]] may have said so, and [[Alice Bailey]] or others, who uses similar ideas, did say so.

[[Imagination:Leighton-Duty-1883.jpg|right|thumb|"Duty" by [[Edmund Leighton]]]]
A '''duty''' (from "due" meaning "that which is owing"; {{lang-fro|deu, did}}, past participle of ''devoir''; {{lang-la|debere, debitum}}, whence "[[debt]]") is a commitment or expectation to perform some action in general or if certain circumstances arise.  A duty may arise from a system of [[ethics]] or [[morality]], especially in an [[honor culture]]. Many duties are based created by [[law]], sometimes including a codified punishment or [[Legal liability|liability]] for non-performance. Performing one's duty may require some [[sacrifice]] of [[self-interest]].

[[Cicero]], an early Roman philosopher who discusses duty in his work “On Duty", suggests that duties can come from four different sources:&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, Marcus T. De Officiis. Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1913. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
# as result of being a human
# as a result of one's particular place in life (one's family, one's country, one's job)
# as a result of one's character
# as a result of one's own moral expectations for oneself

The specific duties imposed by law or culture vary considerably, depending on jurisdiction, [[religion]], and social norms.

==Civic duty==
{{Main|Civic engagement}}
Duty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Joakim |last1=Ekman |first2=Erik |last2=Amnå |title=''Political Participation and Civic Engagement: Towards A New Typology'' |journal=Youth &amp; Society (Working Paper) |page=4 |year=2009 |issue=2 |url = http://www.oru.se/PageFiles/14371/Ekman%20and%20Amnå%202009-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also often perceived as something owed to one’s country (patriotism), or to one's homeland or community. Civic duties could include:

* Obey the law
* Pay taxes
* Provide for a common defense, should the need arise
* Enroll to vote, and vote at all elections and referenda (unless there is a reasonable excuse such as a religious objection, being overseas, or illness on polling day)
* Serve on a jury, if called upon
* Go to the aid of victims of accidents and street-crime and testifying as a witness later in court
* Report contagious illnesses or pestilence to public-health authorities
* Volunteer for public services (e.g. life-saving drills)
* Donate blood periodically or when needed
* [[Duty of revolution]] against an unjust government

==Duties of employment==
Specific [[obligation]]s arise in the services performed by a [[minister (religion)|minister]] of a [[Local church|church]], by a [[soldier]], or by any [[employment|employee]] or servant.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Duty|volume=8|page=736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples:
* [[Dereliction of duty]] is an offense in U.S. military law
* [[Duty to protect]], in medicine
* ''[[In loco parentis]]'', for schools
* [[Professional responsibility]] for lawyers

==Legal duties==
Examples of legal duties include:
* [[Duty of care]]
* [[Duty of candour]]
* [[Duty to defend]] and [[duty to settle]], in insurance
* [[Duty to rescue]]
* [[Duty to retreat]]
* [[Misprision of felony|Duty to report a felony]]
* [[Duty to vote]] (in countries with mandatory voting)
* [[Duty to warn]]
* [[Fiduciary duties]]
* Duty to care for children as [[legal guardian]] (opposite of [[child neglect]])
* Special duties created by a [[contract]]

==Filial duty==
{{see also|Filial piety}}
[[Image:Admonitions Scroll Scene 4.jpg|right|thumb|[[Admonitions Scroll#Scene 4:Lady Feng and the bear|Lady Feng and the Bear]]]]
In most cultures, children are expected to take on duties in relation to their families. This may take the form of behaving in such a way that upholds the family’s honor in the eyes of the community, entering into arranged marriages that benefit the family’s status, or caring for ailing relatives. This family-oriented sense of duty is a particularly central aspect to the teachings of Confucius, and is known as xiao, or [[filial piety]]. As such, the duties of filial piety have played an enormous role in the lives of people in eastern Asia for centuries. For example, the painting ''Lady Feng and the Bear'', from ancient China, depicts the heroic act of a consort of the emperor placing herself between her husband and a rampaging bear. This is meant to be taken as an example of admirable filial behavior. Filial piety is considered so important that in some cases, it outweighs other cardinal virtues: In a more modern example, "concerns with filial piety of the same general sort that motivate women to engage in factory work in Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and elsewhere in Asia are commonly cited by Thai prostitutes as one of their primary rationales for working in the skin trade".&lt;ref&gt;Peletz, Michael Gates. Gender, Sexuality, and Body Politics in Modern Asia. Ann Arbor, MI: Association for Asian Studies, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of filial piety can be expressed in this quote from "The Analects of Confucius": "Yu Tzu said, 'It is rare for a man whose character is such that he is good as a son and obedient as a young man to have the inclination to transgress against his superiors; it is unheard of for one who has no such inclination to be inclined to start a rebellion. The gentleman devotes his efforts to the roots, for once the roots are established, the Way will grow there from. Being good as a son and obedient as a young man is, perhaps, the root of a man's character'".

==In various cultures==
Duty varies between different cultures and continents. Duty in [[Asia]] and [[Latin America]] is commonly more heavily weighted than in [[Western culture]]. According to a study done on attitudes toward family [[obligation]]:
: "Asian and Latin American adolescents possessed stronger values and greater expectations regarding their duty to assist, respect, and support their families than their peers with European backgrounds".&lt;ref&gt;Fuligni, A. J., Tseng, V. and Lam, M. (1999), Attitudes toward Family Obligations among American Adolescents with Asian, Latin American, and European Backgrounds. Child Development, 70: 1030–1044. doi: 10.1111/1467-8624.00075.&lt;/ref&gt;
The deeply rooted [[tradition]] of duty among both Asian and Latin American cultures contributes to much of the strong sense of duty that exists in comparison to western cultures. Michael Peletz discusses the concept of duty in his book ''Gender, Sexuality, and Body Politics in Modern Asia'':
: "Notions of filial duty … are commonly invoked to mobilize the loyalties, labor power, and other resources children in the ostensible interests of the household and, in some cases, those of the lineage clan as a whole. Doctrines of filial piety … attuned to them may thus be a source of great comfort and solace to the elders but they can also be experienced as stressful, repressive, or both by those who are  enjoined to honor their parents’ (and grandparents’) wishes and unspoken expectations".&lt;ref&gt;Peletz, Michael G. Gender, Sexuality, and Body Politics in Modern Asia. Ann Arbor: 	Association for Asian Studies, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
An [[arranged marriage]] is an example of an expected duty in Asia and the [[Middle East]]. In an arranged marriage relating to duty, it is expected that the wife will move in with the husband’s family and household to raise their children. [[Patrilocal residence]] is usual; rarely does the man move in with the woman, or is the married couple allowed to start their own household and life somewhere else. They need to provide for the entire family in labor and care for the farms and family. Older generations rely heavily on the help from their children's and grandchildren's families. This form of duty is in response to keeping the [[lineage (anthropology)|lineage]] of a family intact and obliging to the needs of elders.

== Criticisms of the concept ==

=== Nietzsche ===
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] is among the fiercest critics of the concept of duty. "What destroys a man more quickly", he asks, "than to work, think, and feel without inner necessity, without any deep personal desire, without pleasure—as a mere automaton of “duty”?" (''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'', § 11)

Nietzsche claims that the task of all higher education is "to turn men into machines". The way to turn men into machines is to teach them to tolerate boredom. This is accomplished, Nietzsche says, by means of the concept of duty. (''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'', “Skirmishes of an untimely man” § 9.29)

The '''Ersu Shaba script''', also called ''Ersu Shaba Picture Writing'' and known in Ersu as {{IPA|[ndzārāmá]}}, is the writing system used in texts of the indigenous religion of the [[Ersu people]], which is rendered in Chinese as ''Shābā'' (沙巴). These scriptures are recited in divination and when treating the sick. The script is used for non-scriptural texts as well, such as astrological almanacs, but predominantly ones which concern religion. Only Shaba priests are literate in the script.

The script is predominantly [[pictograph]]ic. It is limited in scope and is not sufficient to write the [[Ersu language]] fully. Some 200 glyphs have been identified, most of them depicting (and resembling) concrete objects. These are combined into composite diagrams. The system is [[proto-writing|(proto-)writing]], as the relationship between form and meaning is fixed: Although glyphs may be written simply or elaborately, they may not be chosen at the author's whim, and pronunciation and interpretation is consistent across the several counties of the Ersu-speaking area. However, it typically takes many words to explain a few glyphs; the connection to language is definite in the object depicted, but the position and context of the glyphs does not have a fixed linguistic correlation.

Writing is done with a bamboo brush or animal hair dipped in white, black, red, blue, green, and yellow-colored ink. The color chosen may affect the meaning. For example, the glyph 'stars and moon' written in black means 'dim', but written in white it means 'shining' (Sun 2009:165).

Following is a reading and explanation of the frame from a Shaba book illustrated at the top of the page. 
[[File:Ersu Shaba diagram.png|left|250px]]
Reading:
:{{quote|''The ninth day of the first lunar month, a dog day, will be a fire day. In the morning there will be fog under the earth. Before sunrise, clouds will appear in the sky. A {{IPA|tsʰintʃʰá}} sword and a {{IPA|npʰópá}} will appear afterwards. This means that the morning will be a good morning. After midday, two stars will die, only one of the three will still be shining and the sun will be in an abnormal condition. One can surmise that there is a deity under the earth; it is better not to move earth that day.'' (Sun 2009:173)}}
Explanation. (The reading is not in any particular order; the explanation will start with the glyph in the center and then go clockwise.)

In the center of the diagram is a dog's head, meaning it is a 'dog day'. The dog's body is red, meaning it's also a [[Wu Xing|fire day]]. The combination means the ninth day of the first lunar month. At the bottom left is fog, meaning the morning will be foggy; if the fog were on the right, it would be in the evening. Above that is a red ''tsá'' jug with a handle (#27 in the table above); ''tsá'' jugs are used for alcohol, and the auspicious red color means that the drinking will be good on that day, meaning the day itself will be comparatively good. At the top left are three stars (22 above), two black and one white; a black star is dim, a white star shining. [Meaning unclear.] At top right is the Sun (18 above) crossed out in chains, meaning it will be hindered and the weather will not be good. The ''npʰópá'' (a religious implement) and the ritual ''tsʰintʃʰá'' knife, which can overcome negative forces, indicate that positive and negative forces will balance.

The Ersu text speaks of a 'white moon', meaning the first half of the month (a black moon is the second half of the month), but it is not clear how this is indicated. The earth deity is not directly mentioned, and must be inferred (Sun p 178).

In [[Jewish history]], [[Jews]] have experienced numerous mass expulsions or ostracism by various local authorities and have sought [[refugee|refuge]] in other countries.

The [[Land of Israel]] was always regarded by Jews as the [[Homeland for the Jewish people|Jewish homeland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wordfromjerusalem.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/the-case-for-israel-chapter1.pdf |title=The Jewish Claim to Palestine |publisher=Word From Jerusalem |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel|establishment]] in 1948, the [[State of Israel]] adopted the 1950 [[Law of Return]] restoring Israel as the Jewish homeland and making it the place of refuge for '''Jewish refugees''' at the time and into the future. This law was intended to encourage Jews to return to their homeland in Israel.

[[Ten lost tribes|Ten]] of twelve [[Tribes of Israel]] are considered lost; but these tribes are not considered [[Jewish]], rather than [[Samaritan]]. These tribes have been living since then near the city of [[Nablus]] in what is today the [[West Bank]].

;119: Large Jewish communities of Cyprus, [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] and Alexandria become extinct after the Jewish defeat in [[Kitos War]] against Rome. This event caused a major demographic shift in the Levant and North Africa. According to Eusebius of Caesarea the outbreak of violence left Libya depopulated to such an extent that a few years later new colonies had to be established there by the emperor Hadrian just to maintain the viability of continued settlement.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

;135/6: The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] defeated [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]].

;629: The entire Jewish population of Galilee is massacred or expelled, following the [[Jewish revolt against Heraclius|Jewish rebellion against Byzantium]].

;7th century: [[Muhammad]] expelled Jewish tribes [[Banu Qaynuqa]] and [[Banu Nadir]] from [[Medina]], The [[Banu Qurayza]] tribe was slaughtered and the Jewish settlement of [[Battle of Khaybar|Khaybar]] was ransacked.

;12th–14th centuries: [[France]]. The practice of expelling the Jews accompanied by confiscation of their property, followed by temporary readmissions for ransom, was used to enrich the crown: expulsions from [[Paris]] by [[Philip Augustus of France|Philip Augustus]] in 1182, from France by [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] in 1254, by [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]] in 1322, by [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] in 1359, by [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] in 1394.

;13th century: The influential [[philosopher]] and [[logician]] [[Ramon Llull]] (1232–1315) called for expulsion of all Jews who would refuse conversion to Christianity. Some scholars regard Llull's as the first comprehensive articulation, in the Christian West, of an expulsionist policy regarding Jews.

]]The [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] persecution started with the [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses]] in 1933, reached a first climax during ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' in 1938 and culminated in [[the Holocaust]] of [[European Jewry]]. The [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]] prohibited Jewish emigration to [[Mandatory Palestine]]. The 1938 [[Evian Conference]], the 1943 [[Bermuda Conference]] and other attempts failed to resolve the problem of Jewish refugees, a fact widely used in [[Nazi propaganda]] (see also [[MS St. Louis|MS ''St. Louis'']]). A small number of [[German Jewish|German]] and [[Austrian Jewish]] refugees from Nazism emigrated to Britain, where attitudes were not necessarily positive.&lt;ref name="Manchester"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phys.org/news/2013-02-british-jews-nazis-myth.html |title=Warm British welcome for Jews fleeing Nazis a 'myth' |publisher=[[Phys.org]] / [[University of Manchester]] |date=February 27, 2013 |accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the refugees fought for Britain in the Second World War. After WW-II, eastern European Holocaust survivors migrated to the allied-controlled part of Europe, as the Jewish society to which most of them belonged did not exist anymore. Often they were lone survivors consumed by the often futile search for other family and friends, and often unwelcome in the towns from which they came. They were known as [[displaced person]]s (also known as [[Sh'erit ha-Pletah]]) and placed in [[displaced persons camp]]s, most of which were by 1951 closed. The last camp [[Föhrenwald]] was closed in 1957.

;1947: [[Egypt]] passed the Companies' Law. This law required that no less than 75% of employees of companies in Egypt must be Egyptian citizens. This law strongly affected Jews, as only about 20% of all [[Jews in Egypt]] were [[Egyptian citizens]]. The rest, although in many cases born in Egypt and living there for generations, did not hold Egyptian citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Egypt.html#5&lt;/ref&gt;

;1948: State of Israel established. [[Antisemitism in Egypt]] strongly intensified. On May 15, 1948, emergency law was declared, and a royal decree forbade Egyptian citizens to leave the country without a special permit. This was applied to Jews. Hundreds of Jews were arrested and many had their property confiscated. In June through August 1948, bombs were planted in Jewish neighborhoods and Jewish businesses looted. About 250 Jews were killed or wounded by the bombs. Roughly 14,000 Jews left Egypt between 1948–50.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Egypt.html&lt;/ref&gt;

;1954: [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] seizes power in Egypt. Nasser immediately arrested many Jews who were tried on various charges, mainly for Zionist and communist activities. Jews were forced to donate large sums of money to the military. Strict supervision of Jewish enterprises was introduced; some were confiscated and others forcibly sold to the government.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

;1956: [[Suez Crisis]]. Roughly 3,000 Egyptian Jews were interned without charge in four detention camps. The government ordered thousands of Jews to leave the country within a few days, and they were not allowed to sell their property, nor to take any capital with them. The deportees were made to sign statements agreeing not to return to Egypt and transferring their property to the administration of the government. The [[International Committee of the Red Cross|International Red Cross]] helped about 8,000 stateless Jews to leave the country, taking most of them to Italy and Greece. Most of the Jews of Port Said (about 100) were smuggled to Israel by Israel agents. The system of deportation continued into 1957. Other Jews left voluntarily, after their livelihoods had been taken from them, until only 8,561 were registered in the 1957 census.  The Jewish exodus continued until there were about 3,000 Jews left as of in 1967.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

'''Here is one hand''' is an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] [[argument]] created by [[George Edward Moore]] in reaction against [[philosophical skepticism]] and in support of [[common sense]].

The argument takes the following form:
* Here is one hand,
* And here is another.
* There are at least two external objects in the world.
* Therefore, an external world exists.

==Introduction==
G. E. Moore wrote "[[A Defence of Common Sense]]" and ''Proof of an External World''. For the purposes of these essays, he posed [[skeptical hypothesis|skeptical hypotheses]], such as "[[Dream argument|you may be dreaming]]" or "[[Five minute hypothesis|the world is 5 minutes old]]", and then provided his own response to them. Such hypotheses ostensibly create a situation where it is not possible to know that anything in the world exists. These hypotheses take the following form:

=== The skeptical argument ===
Where '''S''' is a subject, '''sp''' is a skeptical possibility, such as the [[brain in a vat]] hypothesis, and '''q''' is a knowledge claim about the world:
:* If '''S''' doesn't know that not-'''sp''', then '''S''' doesn't know that '''q'''
:* '''S''' doesn't know that not-'''sp'''
:* Therefore, '''S''' doesn't know that '''q'''

=== Moore's response ===
Moore does not attack the skeptical premise; instead, he reverses the argument from being in the form of [[modus ponens]] to [[modus tollens]]. This logical maneuver is often called a '''G. E. Moore shift''' or a '''Moorean shift.'''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/moore/#SH2d|title=From the Ontology of Cognition to Criteriology|last=Preston|first=Aaron|year=2004|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|series=George Edward Moore (1873—1958)|access-date=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His response takes the following form:
:* If '''S''' doesn't know that not-'''sp''', then '''S''' doesn't know that '''q'''
:* '''S''' knows that '''q'''
:* Therefore, '''S''' knows that not-'''sp'''

==Explanation==
Moore famously put the point into dramatic relief with his 1939 essay ''Proof of an External World'', in which he gave a common sense argument against skepticism by raising his right hand and saying "here is one hand," and then raising his left and saying "and here is another". Here, Moore is taking his knowledge claim ('''q''') to be that he has two hands, and without rejecting the skeptic's premise, seeks to prove that we can know the skeptical possibility ('''sp''') to be untrue.

Moore's argument is not simply a flippant response to the skeptic.  Moore gives, in ''Proof of an External World'', three requirements for a good proof: (1) the premises must be different from the conclusion, (2) the premises must be demonstrated, and (3) the conclusion must follow from the premises. He claims that his proof of an external world meets those three criteria.

In his 1925 essay "A Defence of Common Sense", Moore argues against [[idealism]] and [[skepticism]] toward the external world on the grounds that skeptics could not give reasons to accept their metaphysical premises that were more plausible to him than the reasons he had to accept the common sense claims about our knowledge of the world that skeptics and idealists must deny. In other words, he is more willing to believe that he has a hand than to believe the premises of what he deems "a strange argument in a university classroom." "I do not think it is rational to be as certain of any one of these ... propositions".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/philosophy/virtual_library/articles/derose_keith/responding_to_skepticism.pdf|title=Responding to Skepticism|last=DeRose|first=Keith|year=1999|website=Introduction to 'Skepticism: A Contemporary Reader'|publisher=Oxford UP|access-date=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objections and replies ==
Some subsequent philosophers (especially those inclined to skeptical doubts) have found Moore's method of argument unconvincing.&lt;ref name="podgorski"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/friday-phil-radical-skepticism-ge-moore/|title=Intuition All Alone: On G.E. Moore’s Tempting but Insufficient Answer to Radical Skepticism|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|year=2015|website=The Gemsbok|publisher=|access-date=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One form of refutation contends that Moore's attempted proof fails his second criterion for a good proof (i.e. the premises are not demonstrable in the required sense) by pointing out the difference between demonstrating the [[perception]] that his hands exist and demonstrating the [[Epistemology|knowledge]] that his hands exist. Moore may be doing the former when he means to be doing the latter.&lt;ref name="podgorski" /&gt;

Another form of refutation simply points out that not everyone shares Moore's intuition. If a person finds the skeptical possibility '''sp''' more intuitively likely than the knowledge claim '''q''', then for that person Moore's own defense of [[intuition]] provides a basis for their skepticism.&lt;ref name="podgorski" /&gt;

==Legacy==
Appeals of this type are subsequently often called "Moorean facts".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; "A Moorean fact [is] one of those things that we know better than we know the premises of any philosophical argument to the contrary".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''''How to Start a Revolution''''' is a [[BAFTA]] Award-winning British [[documentary film]] about [[Nobel Peace Prize]] nominee and political theorist [[Gene Sharp]], described as the world's foremost scholar on [[nonviolent revolution]]. The 2011 film describes Sharp's ideas, and their influence on popular uprisings around the world. Screened in cinemas and television in more than 22 countries it became popular among the [[Occupy Wall Street Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/your-democracy/2013/01/gene-sharp-machiavelli-non-violence ''New Statesman'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Directed by British journalist [[Ruaridh Arrow]] the film follows the use of Gene Sharp's work across revolutionary groups throughout the world.  There is particular focus on Sharp's key text ''[[From Dictatorship to Democracy]]''&lt;ref&gt;Gene Sharp (2010), [http://www.aeinstein.org/organizations/org/FDTD.pdf ''From Dictatorship to Democracy'' (full text online)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209144939/http://www.aeinstein.org/organizations/org/FDTD.pdf |date=9 February 2006 }} (4th ed.). East Boston, NA: [[Albert Einstein Institution]]. {{ISBN|978-1-880813-09-6}}, {{ISBN|1-880813-09-2}}, {{OCLC|706499601}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been translated by democracy activists into more than 30 languages and used in revolutions from Serbia and Ukraine to Egypt and Syria. The film describes how Sharp's 198 methods of nonviolent action have inspired and informed uprisings across the globe.

==Cast==
A primary character of the film is [[Gene Sharp]], founder of the [[Albert Einstein Institution]], and a 2009 and 2012 nominee for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;Oslo Newsroom (27 February 2012). [http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/02/27/former-president-bill-clinton-among-nobel-prize-nominees/ "Former President Bill Clinton among Nobel Prize nominees"]. Reuters. The story states: "[[Kristian Berg Harpviken]], director of the [[Peace Research Institute Oslo|Peace Research Institute of Oslo]] and one of the individuals eligible to nominate candidates, has released a short list of those names he had submitted.

==Background and production==
Scottish journalist [[Ruaridh Arrow]], who wrote, directed, and co-produced the film, explained that he first learned about Gene Sharp's work as a student, and then heard that Sharp's booklets were turning up on the sites of many revolutions. But Sharp himself remained largely unknown. In explaining his motivation to make the film, Arrow stated that
{{Quote|Here was this old man [Gene Sharp] sitting in a crumpled house in Boston and that is where revolutionaries go for advice. It was one of the world's great little secrets. It was a little bit of magic and I had to make a film about it.&lt;ref name=brown12&gt;{{cite news|first=Annie |last=Brown |title=Scot's battle to make film on little-known guru of uprisings around world |newspaper=[[Daily Record (Scotland)]] |date=March 24, 2012 |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/editors-choice/2012/03/24/scot-s-battle-to-make-film-on-little-known-guru-of-uprisings-around-world-86908-23800123/}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The film was privately funded by Ruaridh Arrow and additional funding was raised through the US crowdfunding site [[Kickstarter]].&lt;ref name=brown12/&gt; The film raised $57,342 in just under 4 weeks&lt;ref name=brown12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page at Kickstarter for [http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/172444007/how-to-start-a-revolution-a-new-documentary-film How to Start a Revolution]&lt;/ref&gt; making it the most successful British crowdfunded film currently completed.  Several high-profile figures are credited by the producers with supporting the crowdfunding project, including director [[Richard Linklater]] and actress [[Miriam Margolyes]].&lt;ref&gt;Film website, [http://howtostartarevolutionfilm.com/index.php/credits/thankyou "Special Thanks"] (from howtostartarevolutionfilm.com) (accessed 2 May 2012))&lt;/ref&gt;  Completion funding was donated by US art collector James Otis who sold the largest collection of [[Gandhi]] possessions including Gandhi's iconic glasses and sandals in 2009. Otis stated that he was selling the items to help fund nonviolent struggle projects and is described as the Executive Producer of the film.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Sarlin (1 May 2009).

[http://philipbloom.net/blog/revoultion/ Material about filming Gene Sharp from Blog from 29 May 2009] (accessed 2 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  Ruaridh Arrow travelled to Egypt to film the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|Egyptian revolution]] in February 2011 but his camera equipment was seized by Egyptian secret police on landing and key sequences had to be filmed on the iphone4.  Arrow reported live from [[Tahrir Square]] for [[BBC News]] during this period.&lt;ref name=arrow12/&gt;

==Reception==
The film has received a positive critical reception. It received four stars in ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] London'', "a reminder of the importance of intellectual thought to the everyday".&lt;ref&gt;Emmajo Read (no date), [http://admin.timeout.com/film/reviews/91285/how-to-start-a-revolution.html Review of "How to Start a Revolution"], ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out London]]'' (accessed 2 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Huffington Post]] said it was a "vital conversation starter and educational tool in a world awash with violence"&lt;ref name=siegel11/&gt; and the UK's [[Daily Telegraph]] described it as a "World conquering Documentary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Louise |last=Gray |title=Gene Sharp: How to Start a Revolution &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;review of How to Start a Revolution&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; |newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] |date=21 October 2011 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmmakersonfilm/8841546/Gene-Sharp-How-to-Start-a-Revolution.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref name=holden12/&gt; called it a "noble documentary" but criticised the absence of historical context of nonviolent struggles pre-dating Sharp. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described the film as "straightforward", "informative", and "with potential to be updated as world events unfold", stating it "should have a long shelf life". Negative references have been made to the use of dramatic music during certain sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dennis |last=Harvey |title=How to Start a Revolution &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;film review&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; |newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=1 November 2011 |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117946474/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
''How to Start a Revolution'' was released on 18 September 2011 the day after the first Occupy protests in Wall St, New York.  The film was described as the unofficial film of the Occupy movement&lt;ref&gt;http://we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/2012/01/the-american-academic-gene-sha.php#.UNSxf0IctUQ&lt;/ref&gt; and shown in camps across the US and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.occupybellinghamwa.org/ai1ec_event/film-how-to-start-a-revolution-at-the-pickford-2/?instance_id%3D |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509115938/http://www.occupybellinghamwa.org/ai1ec_event/film-how-to-start-a-revolution-at-the-pickford-2/?instance_id= |archivedate=9 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://occupymaine.org/voices/25-sun-18-2011-7pm-film-how-to-start-a-revolution |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222034703/http://occupymaine.org/voices/25-sun-18-2011-7pm-film-how-to-start-a-revolution |archivedate=22 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.occupyboston.org/2011/11/09/how-start-revolution-film-screening-occupy-boston-tonight-7pm/&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of a number of high-profile events held in London's [[Bank of Ideas]] along with a concert by British band [[Radiohead]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In 2012 following the Mexican general election one of the country's largest newspapers reported that protestors were circulating a pirated Spanish translation of ''How to Start a Revolution'' which had gone viral in the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informador.com.mx/suplementos/2012/422991/6/mr-revolution-y-el-evangelio-de-la-no-violencia.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The translation was viewed over half a million times in the space of three days.  Reports have also been published citing the airing of the film on Spanish television concurrent with widespread discussion of Sharp's work in the Spanish anti-austerity [[15-M Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;http://wagingnonviolence.org/feature/the-spanish-15-m-movement-deepens-its-civil-disobedience-with-a-dash-of-gene-sharp/&lt;/ref&gt;

A film about the making of ''How to Start a Revolution'', entitled ''Road to Revolution'', was screened in January 2012 by [[Current TV]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://current.com/new-year-new-revolution/road-to-revolution Road to Revolution Premieres 1 January at 8.30pm] (accessed 2 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;After the screening of the ''Road to Revolution'', the film itself, ''How to Start a Revolution'', was also shown on [[Current TV]]: [http://current.com/new-year-new-revolution/how-to-start-a-revolution/ ''How To Start A Revolution'' Premieres 1 January at 9pm] (accessed 2 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 22, 2017, after the inauguration of President Donald Trump, the [[PBS America]] channel screened ''How to Start a Revolution'' immediately after a ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' investigation into his election.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbsamerica.co.uk/series/how-to-start-a-revolution/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Touch Documentary==
In 2012 ''How to Start a Revolution'' was among the first "[[Touch Documentaries]]" to be released using the Apple iPad platform.  The film was integrated into the platform along with four of Gene Sharp's books in several languages, including ''From Dictatorship to Democracy'', and several of Sharp's lectures. The app is supplemented by analysis and satellite mapping which is offered up to the viewer while watching the film.&lt;ref name="internationalpeaceandconflict.org"&gt;http://www.internationalpeaceandconflict.org/forum/topics/pcdn-review-of-the-how-to-start-a-revolution-ipad-app?xg_source=activity#.USUXybR2tUQ&lt;/ref&gt;  A "Revolution Monitor" is also included which fuses Google Earth maps with Twitter displaying tweets and YouTube links from revolutionary groups and individuals when countries of interest are touched by the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;http://howtostartarevolutionfilm.com/index.php/ipad&lt;/ref&gt;
A review by The Peace &amp; Collaborative Network described the app as "simply a must-have among peace studies scholars, those actively working to start or reorganize revolutions, or anyone who is interested in the logistics, history, and outcomes of nonviolent revolutions" &lt;ref name="internationalpeaceandconflict.org"/&gt;
The ''How to Start a Revolution'' [[touch documentary]] was shortlisted for the International Best Digital Media award in the One World Media Awards 2013 &lt;ref&gt;http://oneworldmedia.org.uk/awards/shortlist&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Informational''' (or '''information''') '''cascades''' happen when Internet users start passing on information they assume to be true, but cannot know to be true, based on information on what other users are doing. Information cascades can be accelerated by search engines' ranking technologies and their [[personalized search|tendency to return results relevant to a user's previous interests]]. This type of information spreading is hard to stop. Information cascades over social media and the Internet may also be harmless, and may contain truthful information.

An information cascade is generally accepted as a two-step process. For a cascade to begin an individual must encounter a scenario with a decision, typically a binary one. Second, outside factors can influence this decision (typically, through the observation of actions and their outcomes of other individuals in similar scenarios). Due to this influence, researchers have drawn comparisons between information cascades and [[herd behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duan|first=Wenjing|last2=Gu|first2=Bin|last3=Whinston|first3=Andrew B.|date=2008-03-01|title=Informational Cascades and Software Adoption on the Internet: An Empirical Investigation|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1103165|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two-step process of an informational cascade can be broken down into five basic components:

1. There is a [[Decision making|decision to be made]] – for example; whether to adopt a new technology, wear a new style of clothing, eat in a new restaurant, or support a particular             political position

2. A limited action space exists (e.g. an adopt/reject decision)

3. People make the decision sequentially, and each person can observe the choices made by those who acted earlier

4. Each person has some information aside from their own that helps guide their decision

5. A person can't directly observe the outside information that other people know, but he or she can make inferences about this information from what they do

Social perspectives of cascades, which suggest that agents may act irrationally (e.g., against what they think is optimal) when social pressures are great, exist as complements to the concept of information cascades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schiller | first1 = R.J. | year = 1995 | title = Conversation, Information and Herd Behavior | url = | journal = Rhetoric and Economic Behavior | volume = 85 | issue = 3| pages = 181–185 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More often the problem is that the concept of an information cascade is confused with ideas that do not match the two key conditions of the process, such as [[social proof]], information diffusion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gruhl | first1 = Daniel | last2 = Guha | first2 = R. | last3 = Liben-Nowell | first3 = D. | last4 = Tomkins | first4 = A. | year = 2004 | title = Information diffusion through blogspace | url = | journal = WWW | volume = | issue = | pages = 491–501 | doi = 10.1145/988672.988739 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[social influence]]. Indeed, the term information cascade has even been used to refer to such processes.&lt;ref&gt;Sadikov, E.; Medina, M.; Leskovec, J.; Garcia-Molina, H. (2011).

== Basic model ==

=== Qualitative example ===

Information cascades occur when  external information obtained from previous participants in an event overrides one's own private signal, irrespective of the correctness of the former over the latter.  The experiment conducted in&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=L.R.|author2=Holt, C.A.|title=Information Cascades in the Laboratory|journal=The American Economic Review|year=1997|volume=87|issue=5|pages=847–862}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a useful example of this process.  The experiment consisted of two urns labeled A and B. Urn A contains two balls labeled "a" and one labeled "b". Urn B contains one ball labeled "a" and two labeled "b". The urn from which a ball must be drawn during each run is determined randomly and with equal probabilities (from the throw of a die). The contents of the chosen urn are emptied into a neutral container. The participants are then asked in random order to draw a marble from this container. This entire process may be termed a "run", and a number of such runs are performed.

Each time a participant picks up a marble, he is to decide which urn it belongs to. His decision is then announced for the benefit of the remaining participants in the room. Thus, the (n+1)th participant has information about the decisions made by all the n participants preceding him, and also his private signal which is the label on the ball that he draws during his turn. The experimenters observed that an information cascade was observed in 41 of 56 such runs. This means, in the runs where the cascade occurred, at least one participant gave precedence to earlier decisions over his own private signal. It is possible for such an occurrence to produce the wrong result. This phenomenon is known as "Reverse Cascade".

=== Quantitative description ===

A person's signal telling them to accept is denoted as {{mvar|H}} (a high signal, where high signifies he should accept), and a signal telling them not to accept is {{mvar|L}} (a low signal).  The model assumes that when the correct decision is to accept, individuals will be more likely to see an {{mvar|H}}, and conversely, when the correct decision is to reject, individuals are more likely to see an {{mvar|L}} signal.  This is essentially a [[conditional probability]] – the probability of {{mvar|H}}  when the correct action is to accept, or &lt;math&gt;P[H|A]&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly &lt;math&gt;P[L|R]&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that an agent gets an {{mvar|L}} signal when the correct action is reject.   If these likelihoods are represented by ''q'', then ''q'' &gt; 0.5.  This is summarized in the table below.&lt;ref name="Easley"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/|title=Networks, Crowds and Markets: Reasoning about a Highly Connected Workld|last=Easley|first=David|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|pages=483–506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-

|-
|  ''H''       || 1-''q''                || ''q''
|}
 
The first agent determines whether or not to accept solely based on his own signal.  As the model assumes that all agents act rationally, the action (accept or reject) the agent feels is more likely is the action he will choose to take.  This decision can be explained using [[Bayes rule]]:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  P\left(A|H\right) &amp;= \frac{P\left(A\right) P\left(H|A\right)}{P\left(H\right)} \\
                    &amp;= \frac{P\left(A\right) P\left(H|A\right)}{P\left(A\right) P\left(H|A\right) + P\left(R\right) P\left(H|R\right)} \\
                    &amp;= \frac{pq}{pq + \left(1 - p\right)\left(1 - q\right)} \\
                    &amp;&gt; p
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If the agent receives an {{mvar|H}} signal, then the likelihood of accepting is obtained by calculating &lt;math&gt;P[A|H]&lt;/math&gt;.  The equation says that, by virtue of the fact that ''q'' &gt; 0.5, the first agent, acting only on his private signal, will always increase his estimate of ''p'' with an {{mvar|H}} signal.  Similarly, it can be shown that an agent will always decrease his expectation of ''p'' when he receives a low signal.  Recalling that, if the value, {{mvar|V}}, of accepting is equal to the value of rejecting, then an agent will accept if he believes ''p'' &gt; 0.5, and reject otherwise.  Because this agent started out with the assumption that both accepting and rejecting are equally viable options (''p'' = 0.5), the observation of an {{mvar|H}} signal will allow him to conclude that accepting is the rational choice.

The second agent then considers both the first agent's decision and his own signal, again in a rational fashion.  In general, the ''n''th agent considers the decisions of the previous ''n''-1 agents, and his own signal.  He makes a decision based on Bayesian reasoning to determine the most rational choice.
 
&lt;math&gt;P (A | \text{Previous}, \text{Personal signal}) = \frac{pq^a (1 - q)^b}{p q^a (1 - q)^b + (1 - p)(1 - q)^a q^b}&lt;/math&gt;
 
Where {{mvar|a}} is the number of accepts in the previous set plus the agent's own signal, and {{mvar|b}} is the number of rejects.  Thus, {{tmath|1=a + b = n}}.  The decision is based on how the value on the right hand side of the equation compares with ''p''.&lt;ref name="Easley"/&gt;

===Explicit model assumptions===

The original model makes several assumptions about human behavior and the world in which humans act,&lt;ref name="Bik"&gt;Bikhchandani, S., [[David Hirshleifer|Hirshleifer, D]]., and [[Ivo Welch|Welch, I]]. (1992), "A Theory of Fads, Fashion, Custom, and Cultural Change as Informational Cascades," ''Journal of Political Economy'', Volume 100, Issue 5, pp. [http://www.irvinehousingblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/atheoryoffads.pdf pp. 992-1026.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713060849/http://www.irvinehousingblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/atheoryoffads.pdf |date=2011-07-13 }} '''+''' button to enlarge.&lt;/ref&gt; some of which are relaxed in later versions&lt;ref name="Easley"/&gt; or in alternate definitions of similar problems, such as the [[diffusion of innovations]]. 
 
#Boundedly Rational Agents: The original Independent Cascade model assumes humans are boundedly rational&lt;ref name=newellsimon&gt;{{cite book|last=Newell|first=A.|title=Human problem solving|year=1972|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; – that is, they will always make rational decisions based on the information they can observe, but the information they observe may not be complete or correct.  In other words, agents do not have complete knowledge of the world around them (which would allow them to make the correct decision in any and all situations).  In this way, there is a point at which, even if a person has correct knowledge of the idea or action cascading, they can be convinced via social pressures to adopt some alternate, incorrect view of the world.
#Incomplete Knowledge of Others: The original information cascade model assumes that agents have incomplete knowledge of the agents which precede them in the specified order.  As opposed to definitions where agents have some knowledge of the "private information" held by previous agents, the current agent makes a decision based only on the observable action (whether or not to imitate) of those preceding him.  It is important to note that the original creators argue this is a reason why information cascades can be caused by small shocks.
#Behavior of all previous agents is known

=== Resulting conditions ===

#'''Cascades will always occur''' – as discussed, in the simple mode, the likelihood of a cascade occurring increases towards 1 as the number of people making decisions increases towards infinity.
#'''Cascades can be incorrect''' – because agents make decisions with both bounded rationality and probabilistic knowledge of the initial truth (e.g. whether accepting or rejecting is the correct decision), the incorrect behavior may cascade through the system.
#'''Cascades can be based on little information''' – mathematically, a cascade of an infinite length can occur based only on the decision of two people.  More generally, a small set of people who strongly promote an idea as being rational can rapidly influence a much larger subset of the general population
#'''Cascades are fragile''' – because agents receive no extra information after the difference between a and b increases beyond 2, and because such differences can occur at small numbers of agents, agents considering opinions from those agents who are making decisions based on actual information can be dissuaded from a choice rather easily.&lt;ref name="Bik"/&gt; thus suggests that cascades are susceptible to the release of public information.&lt;ref name="Bik"/&gt; also discusses this result in the context of the underlying value p changing over time, in which case a cascade can rapidly change course.

== Responding ==

A literature exists that examines how individuals or firms might respond to the existence of informational cascades when they have products to sell but where buyers are unsure of the quality of those products. Curtis Taylor (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=C.|title=Time-on-the-Market as a Sign of Quality.|journal=Review of Economic Studies|year=1999|volume=66|pages=555–578|doi=10.1111/1467-937x.00098}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that when selling a house the seller might wish to start with high prices, as failure to sell with low prices is indicative of low quality and might start a cascade on not buying, while failure to sell with high prices could be construed as meaning the house is just over-priced, and prices can then be reduced to get a sale. Daniel Sgroi (2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sgroi|first=D.|date=|year=2002|title=Optimizing Information in the Herd: Guinea Pigs, Profits, and Welfare|url=|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|volume=39|pages=137–166|doi=10.1006/game.2001.0881|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that firms might use "guinea pigs" who are given the opportunity to buy early to kick-start an informational cascade through their early and public purchasing decisions, and work by David Gill and Daniel Sgroi (2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gill|first=D.|author2=D. Sgroi|title=Sequential Decisions with Tests.|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|year=2008|volume=63|pages=663–678|doi=10.1016/j.geb.2006.07.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that early public tests might have a similar effect (and in particular that passing a "tough test" which is biased against the seller can instigate a cascade all by itself). Bose ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bose|first=S.|author2=G. Orosel |author3=M. Ottaviani |author4=L. Vesterlund |title=Dynamic Monopoly Pricing and Herding.|journal=RAND Journal of Economics|year=2006|volume=37|pages=910–928 |doi=10.1111/j.1756-2171.2006.tb00063.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; have examined how prices set by a monopolist might evolve in the presence of potential cascade behavior where the monopolist and consumers are unsure of a products quality.

==Examples and fields of application==
Information cascades occur in situations where seeing many people make the same choice provides evidence that outweighs one's own judgment.  That is, one thinks:  "It's more likely that I'm wrong than that all those other people are wrong.  Therefore, I will do as they do."

In what has been termed a [[reputational cascade]], late responders sometimes go along with the decisions of early responders, not just because the late responders think the early responders are right, but also because they perceive their reputation will be damaged if they dissent from the early responders.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Lemieux (2003), "Following the Herd", ''[[Regulation (magazine)|Regulation]]'', [[Cato Institute]], 21. {{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv26n4/v26n4-2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616042143/http://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv26n4/v26n4-2.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-16 |df= }}.  Retrieved 14 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Market cascades ===
Information cascades have become one of the topics of [[behavioral economics]], as they are often seen in financial markets where they can feed speculation and create cumulative and excessive [[market price|price moves]], either for the whole market ([[bubble (economics)|market bubble]]...) or a specific asset, like a stock that becomes overly popular among investors.

Marketers also use the idea of cascades to attempt to get a buying cascade started for a new product. If they can induce an initial set of people to adopt the new product, then those who make purchasing decisions later on may also adopt the product even if it is no better than, or perhaps even worse than, competing products. This is most effective if these later consumers are able to observe the adoption decisions, but not how satisfied the early customers actually were with the choice. This is consistent with the idea that cascades arise naturally when people can see what others do but not what they know.&lt;ref&gt;http://research.ivo-welch.info/palgrave.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information cascades are usually considered by economists:
* as products of [[rational expectations]] at their start,
* as irrational [[herd behavior]] if they persist for too long, which signals that collective emotions come also into play to feed the cascade.

=== Social network analysis ===
Dotey et al.&lt;ref&gt;Dotey, A., Rom, H. and Vaca C., Information Diffusion in Social Media. 2011, Stanford University&lt;/ref&gt; state that information flows in the form of cascades on the social network. According to the authors, analysis of virality of information cascades on a social network may lead to many useful applications like determining the most influential individuals within a network. This information can be used for ''maximizing market effectiveness'' or ''influencing public opinion''. Various structural and temporal features of a network affect cascade virality.

In contrast to work on information cascades in social networks, the Social Influence Model of belief spread argues that people have some notion of the private beliefs of those in their network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedkin|first=N.E. and Johnsen, E.C.|title=Social Influence Network Theory: A Sociological Examination of Small Group Dynamics|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The social influence model, then, relaxes the assumption of information cascades that people are acting only on observable actions taken by others.  In addition, the social influence model focuses on embedding people within a social network, as opposed to a queue.  Finally, the social influence model relaxes the assumption of the information cascade model that people will either complete an action or not by allowing for a continuous scale of the "strength" of an agents belief that an action should be completed.

=== Historical examples ===
* Small protests began in [[Leipzig]], Germany in 1989 with just a handful of activists challenging the [[German Democratic Republic]].&lt;ref name=shirky&gt;{{cite book

* The adoption rate of drought-resistant hybrid seed corn during the [[Great Depression]] and [[Dust Bowl]] was slow despite its significant improvement over the previously available seed corn.

=== Empirical Studies ===
In addition to the examples above, Information Cascades have been shown to exist in several empirical studies.  Perhaps the best example, given above, is.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; Participants stood in a line behind an urn which had balls of different colors.  Sequentially, participants would pick a ball out of the urn, looks at it, and then places it back into the urn.  The agent then voices their opinion of which color of balls (red or blue) there is a majority of in the urn for the rest of the participants to hear.  Participants get a monetary reward if they guess correctly, forcing the concept of rationality.

Other examples include
* De Vany and Walls&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Vany|first=A.|author2=D. Walls|title=Uncertainty in the movie industry: does star power reduce the terror of the box office?|journal=Journal of Cultural Economics|year=1999|volume=23|pages=285–318|doi=10.1023/a:1007608125988}}&lt;/ref&gt;  create a statistical model of information cascades where an action is required.  They apply this model to the actions people take to go see a movie that has come out at the theatre.  De Vany and Walls validate their model on this data, finding a similar [[Pareto distribution]] of revenue for different movies.
* Walden and Browne also adopt the original Information Cascade model, here into an operational model more practical for real world studies, which allows for analysis based on observed variables.  Walden and Browne test their model on data about adoption of new technologies by businesses, finding support for their hypothesis that information cascades play a role in this adoption&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walden|first=Eric|author2=Glenn Browne|title=Information Cascades in the Adoption of New Technology|journal=ICIS Proceedings|year=2002|url=http://aisel.aisnet.org/icis2002/40/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal aspects==
The negative effects of informational cascades sometimes become a legal concern and laws have been enacted to neutralize them. [[Ward Farnsworth]], a law professor, analyzed the legal aspects of informational cascades and gave several examples in his book ''The Legal Analyst'': in many [[military court]]s, the officers voting to decide a case vote in reverse rank order (the officer of the lowest rank votes first), and he suggested it may be done so the lower-ranked officers would not be tempted by the cascade to vote with the more senior officers, who are believed to have more accurate judgement; another example is that countries such as [[Israel]] and [[France]] have laws that prohibit polling days or weeks before [[election]]s to prevent the effect of informational cascade that may influence the election results.&lt;ref&gt;Farnsworth, Ward (2007). ''The Legal Analyst: A Toolkit for Thinking about the Law''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-23835-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Globalization ==
As previously stated, informational cascades are logical processes describing how an individual’s decision process changes based upon outside information. Cascades have never been a household name; at best, they exist hypothetically. Over the past few decades, cascades saw an increase in popularity through various fields of study. Specifically, they have been quite useful in comparing thought processes between Greek and German organic farmers. The aforementioned study suggests discrepancies between Greek and German thought processes based upon their cultural and socioeconomic differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chatzimichael|first=Konstantinos|last2=Genius|first2=Margarita|last3=Tzouvelekas|first3=Vangelis|date=2013-07-03|title=Informational cascades and technology adoption: Evidence from Greek and German organic growers|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919214001274|journal=Journal of Food Policy|volume=49|pages=186–195|via=ELSEVIER|doi=10.1016/j.foodpol.2014.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even further, cascades have been extrapolated to ideas such as financial volatility and monetary policy. In 2004 Helmut Wagner and Wolfram Berger suggested cascades as an analytical vehicle to examine changes to the financial market as it became more globalized. Wagner and Berger noticed structural changes to the framework of understanding financial markets due to globalization; giving rise to volatility in capital flow and spawning uncertainty which affected central banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wagner|first=Helmut|last2=Berger|first2=Wolfram|date=2004-06-01|title=Globalization, Financial Volatility and Monetary Policy|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10633-004-0915-4|journal=Empirica|language=en|volume=31|issue=2–3|pages=163–184|doi=10.1007/s10633-004-0915-4|issn=0340-8744}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, information cascades are useful in understanding the origins of terrorist tactics. When the attack by Black September occurred in 1972 it was hard not to see the similarities between their tactics and the Baader-Meinhof group (also known as the Red Army Faction [RAF]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/904285976|title=Ulrike Meinhof and the Red Army Faction : performing terrorism|last=1981-|first=Passmore, Leith,|isbn=9780230370777|edition=First|location=New York|oclc=904285976}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these examples portray how the process of cascades were put into use. Moreover, it is important to understand the framework of cascades to move forward in a more globalized society. Establishing a foundation to understanding the passage of information through transnational and multinational organizations, and even more, is critical to the arising modern society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamlett|first=Patrick W.|last2=Cobb|first2=Michael D.|date=2006-11-01|title=Potential Solutions to Public Deliberation Problems: Structured Deliberations and Polarization Cascades|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-0072.2006.00195.x/abstract|journal=Policy Studies Journal|language=en|volume=34|issue=4|pages=629–648|doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.2006.00195.x|issn=1541-0072}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Summing up all of these points, cascades, as a general term, encompass a spectrum of different concepts. Information cascades have been the underlying thread in how information is transferred, overwritten, and understood through various cultures spanning from a multitude of different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drezner|first=Daniel W.|date=2010|title=Weighing the Scales: The Internet's Effect On State-Society Relations|journal=The Brown Journal of World Affairs|volume=16|issue=2|pages=31–44|doi=10.2307/24590907|jstor=24590907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Integrated landscape management''' is a way of managing a landscape that brings together multiple stakeholders, who collaborate to integrate policy and practice for their different land use objectives, with the purpose of achieving sustainable landscapes.&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reed" /&gt;

Integrated landscape management is one approach to addressing the major global challenges of [[poverty]], [[food security]], [[climate change]], [[water scarcity]], [[deforestation]] and [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] at the local level. Proponents of integrated landscape management argue that as these challenges are interconnected, coordinated approaches are needed to address them, in order for landscapes (heterogenous geographic areas) to generate multiple benefits. For example, one river basin can supply water for towns and agriculture, timber and food crops for smallholders and industry, and habitat for biodiversity; the way in which each one of these sectors pursues its goals can have impacts on the others.&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=A K|last2=McMichael|first2=P|last3=Milder|first3=J C|last4=Scherr|first4=S J|title=Multi-functional landscapes from the grassroots?

Integrated landscape management is increasingly recognised and taken up by intergovernmental bodies,&lt;ref name="SBSTTA report" /&gt; government initiatives,&lt;ref name="GMS BLL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IINDC" /&gt; research institutes,&lt;ref name="CIFOR landscapes pg" /&gt; and some of the world's largest conservation NGOs,&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt; resulting in an increase in the number of examples of the approach in practice. However, barriers to uptake include difficulties in monitoring integrated landscape management and the proliferation of definitions and terms relating to it.&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt;

== Development and uptake of the approach ==
Efforts to develop and implement concepts that integrate social and economic development, and biodiversity conservation are not new.  Integrated landscape management has evolved through multiple iterations and alongside other concepts&lt;ref name="Reed"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=J|last2=Deakin|first2=E|last3=Sunderland|first3=T|title=What are ‘Integrated Landscape Approaches’ and how effectively have they been implemented in the tropics: a systematic map protocol|journal=Environmental Evidence|date=2015|volume=4:2|url=http://www.cifor.org/library/5422/what-are-integrated-landscape-approaches-and-how-effectively-have-they-been-implemented-in-the-tropics-a-systematic-map-protocol/|issn=2047-2382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="learning"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=J|last2=Van Vianen|first2=J|last3=Deakin|first3=E L|last4=Barlow|first4=J|last5=Sunderland|first5=T|title=Integrated landscape approaches to managing social and environmental issues in the tropics: learning from the past to guide the future|journal=Global Change Biology|date=2016|doi=10.1111/gcb.13284|volume=22|pages=2540–2554}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scherr"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scherr|first1=S J|last2=Shames|first2=S|last3=Friedman|first3=R|title=Defining Integrated Landscape Management for Policy Makers|journal=Ecoagriculture Policy Focus|date=2013|issue=10|url=http://ecoagriculture.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/DefiningILMforPolicyMakers.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Minang"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Minang|first1=P A|last2=van Noordwijk|first2=M|last3=Freeman|first3=O E|last4=Mbow|first4=C|last5=de Leeuw|first5=J|last6=Catacutan|first6=D|title=Climate-Smart Landscapes: Multifunctionality In Practice|date=2015|publisher=World Agroforestry Center (ICRAF)|location=Nairobi, Kenya}}&lt;/ref&gt; – from [[watershed management]] to [[landscape ecology]]&lt;ref name="Sayer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sayer|first1=J|title=Reconciling conservation and development: are landscapes the answer?|journal=Biotropica|date=2009|volume=41|issue=6|doi=10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00575.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00575.x/abstract|pages=649–652}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from [[landscape-scale conservation]] to indigenous biocultural territorial development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indigenous Biocultural Territories|url=http://www.biocultural.iied.org/indigenous-biocultural-territories|publisher=IIED}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has much in common with the concept of the water-energy-food nexus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water, Food and Energy Nexus|url=http://www.unwater.org/topics/water-food-and-energy-nexus/en/|publisher=UN Water}}&lt;/ref&gt; and draws on the [[ecosystem approach]] (the primary framework for action under the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecosystem Approach Introduction|url=https://www.cbd.int/ecosystem/|publisher=CBD}}&lt;/ref&gt;). There are particular parallels with ‘climate-smart agriculture', which also aims for landscapes to provide multiple benefits in terms of food security, rural livelihoods, and climate change adaptation and mitigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=FAO|title="Climate-Smart" Agriculture: Policies, Practices and Financing for Food Security, Adaptation and Mitigation|date=2010|publisher=FAO|location=Rome, Italy|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i1881e/i1881e00.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interest in landscape approaches has increased in recognition of the connections between the global challenges of [[poverty]], [[food security]], [[climate change]], [[water scarcity]], [[deforestation]] and loss of [[biodiversity]]. For example, lifting people out of poverty can increase consumption and drive climate change;&lt;ref name="Stern"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stern|first1=N|title=The Economics of Climate Change: the Stern Review|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; increasing agricultural production can exacerbate water scarcity and drive habitat loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tilman|first1=D|title=Global environmental impacts of agricultural expansion: the need for sustainable and efficient practices|journal=Proc.

Integrated landscape management has been adopted at the intergovernmental level by the [[UN Environment Programme]], which states that "UNEP champions the landscape approach de facto as it embodies the main elements of integrated ecosystem management"; UNEP puts the approach into practice through a  multinational project of Ecosystem Management of Productive Landscapes.&lt;ref name="UNEPEMPL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecosystems Management of Productive Landscapes|url=https://unepempl.wordpress.com/about/|publisher=UN Environment Programme (UNEP)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] also recognises the approach: its scientific committee has compiled information on improving sustainable use of biodiversity in a landscape perspective, and stated that "As sustainability can only be achieved at an appropriate spatial and temporal context, the landscape level is arguably the most important spatial scale to improve and assess the sustainable management of agricultural and forest ecosystems.".&lt;ref name="SBSTTA report"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Convention on Biological Diversity|first1=SBSTTA|title=Report on how to improve sustainable use of biodiversity in a landscape perspective (UNEP/CBD/SBSTTA/15/13)|url=https://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/sbstta/sbstta-15/official/sbstta-15-13-en.pdf|website=Convention on Biological Diversity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape approaches are also being taken up by national governments (for example, to inform international cooperation for the Greater Mekong Subregion,&lt;ref name="GMS BLL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biodiversity Landscapes and Livelihoods|url=http://www.gms-eoc.org/biodiversity-conservation-corridors-initiative|website=Greater Mekong Subregion - Core Environment Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GMS Workshop on Landscape Approaches|url=http://www.gms-eoc.org/events/gms-workshop-on-landscape-approaches|website=Greater Mekong Subregion - Core Environment Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a foundational principle of Indonesia's climate change commitments&lt;ref name="IINDC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Republic of Indonesia|title=Intended Nationally Determined Contribution|url=http://www4.unfccc.int/submissions/INDC/Published%20Documents/Indonesia/1/INDC_REPUBLIC%20OF%20INDONESIA.pdf|website=UNFCCC submissions}}&lt;/ref&gt;); by international research bodies (for example, the [[Center for International Forestry Research]],&lt;ref name="CIFOR landscapes pg"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR)|url=http://www.cifor.org/sustainable-landscapes/|website=Sustainable Landscapes}}&lt;/ref&gt; which convenes the Global Landscapes Forum&lt;ref name="GLF homepage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landscapes.org/|website=Global Landscapes Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;); and conservation NGOs (for example, the [[Worldwide Fund for Nature]], Global Canopy Programme, [[The Nature Conservancy]], IDH - The Sustainable Trade Initiative, and EcoAgriculture Partners, which collaborated on a book on integrated landscape management&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;).

== Definitions ==
A plethora of overlapping ideas and definitions have emerged,&lt;ref name="Reed" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://forestsnews.cifor.org/23834/landscape-approach-defies-simple-definition-and-thats-good?fnl=en|title=‘Landscape approach’ defies simple definition — and that’s good|date=2014-08-27|work=CIFOR Forests News|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; defining landscapes, landscape management, and landscape approaches from the perspectives of different fields (see alternative definitions under [[landscape ecology]], for example). Despite differences in definitions, many terms can be seen as entry points for landscape approaches.&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Minang" /&gt; One set of definitions (developed by a consortium of research groups and NGOs&lt;ref name="LSLB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denier|first1=L|last2=Scherr|first2=S|last3=Shames|first3=S|last4=Chatterton|first4=P|last5=Hovani|first5=L|last6=Stam|first6=N|title=The Little Sustainable Landscapes Book|date=2015|publisher=Global Canopy Programme|location=Oxford|url=http://globalcanopy.org/sustainablelandscapes}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that aims to create a stepwise progression through landscapes, sustainable landscapes, integrated landscape management and landscape approaches is as follows:

"A landscape is a [[socio-ecological system]] that consists of natural and/or human-modified ecosystems, and which is influenced by distinct ecological, historical, economic and socio-cultural processes and activities."&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;

"A sustainable landscape helps to meet the principles of sustainable development as defined in the UN [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. These are landscapes that can meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;

"Integrated landscape management is a way of managing the landscape that involves collaboration among multiple stakeholders, with the purpose of achieving sustainable landscapes."

"The governance structure, size and scope, and number and type of stakeholders involved (private sector, civil society, government) can vary. The level of cooperation also varies, from information sharing and consultation, to more formal models with shared decision-making and joint implementation."&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;

"A landscape approach is a conceptual framework whereby stakeholders in a landscape aim to reconcile competing social, economic and environmental objectives. It seeks to move away from the often-unsustainable sectoral approach to land management. A landscape approach aims to ensure the realisation of local level needs and action (i.e. the interests of different stakeholders within the landscape), while also considering goals and outcomes important to stakeholders outside the landscape, such as national governments or the international community."&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;

== Relevance to international commitments ==
Proponents of integrated landscape management argued that it is well-suited to address complex global challenges, such as those that are the focus of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] and policies for [[Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation]] (REDD+).&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SDG briefing" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reed J, van Vianen J, Sunderland T. 2015. From 
global complexity to local reality: Aligning implementation pathways for the Sustainable Development Goals and landscape approaches
. Infobrief No. 129. Bogor, Indonesia: Center for International Forestry Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the '''Sustainable Development Goals''', researchers have drawn parallels between the interdependent nature of these Goals, and the perceived potential for integrated landscape management to maximise collaboration in planning, policy development and action across multiple sectors at the landscape scale.&lt;ref name="SDG briefing" /&gt; Many of the Sustainable Development Goals have potential synergies and trade-offs (conflicts): proponents therefore argue that a sectoral approach may not be effective, whereas landscape approaches provide a potential framework to manage these interlinked challenges. To give more specific examples, increased areas of irrigated agricultural land to meet Goal 2 (ending hunger) could have adverse impacts on Goal 15 (terrestrial ecosystems) or on Goal 6 (sustainable water management).&lt;ref&gt;Reed J, van Vianen J, Sunderland T. 2015. From global complexity to local reality: Aligning implementation pathways for the Sustainable Development Goals and landscape approaches. Infobrief No. 129. Bogor, Indonesia: Center for International Forestry Research.&lt;/ref&gt; Landscape approaches are intended to systematically consider and include diverse stakeholders and sectors, and thus create a mechanism to achieve the multiple objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals – for example, working across the catchment area of a river to enhance agricultural productivity, flood defence, biodiversity and carbon storage, while also strengthened institutions for rural communities.&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;

In terms of '''climate change and REDD+''', unlike other sectors that emit greenhouse gases, the land use sector (including agriculture and forestry) has the potential to mitigate climate change by actively removing greenhouse gases, in addition to simply reducing emissions, especially through reforestation and landscape restoration. This sector accounts for around 24% of anthropogenic emisisons - and a much greater proportion of emissions in many developing countries, where land use represents the largest potential for climate change mitigation.&lt;ref&gt;Smith P., M.

== Principles and elements ==
Many ways of implementing integrated landscape management have been identified. Two long-term processes by two coalitions of researchers and NGOs developed ten principles for integrated landscape management,&lt;ref name="Ten P" /&gt; and five elements of integrated landscape management.&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;

The '''Ten Principles of Landscape Approach''' include the need for continual learning and [[adaptive management]], which incorporates participatory monitoring; the expectation that actions take place at multiple scales and that landscapes are multifunctional (e.g. supplying both goods, such as timber and food, and services, such as water and biodiversity protection); and although there will be multiple stakeholders, they nonetheless have a common concern about the landscape, negotiate change with each other in a transparent way, and their rights and responsibilities are clear or become clear through the process.&lt;ref name="Ten P"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sayer|first1=J|last2=Sunderland|first2=T|last3=Ghazoul|first3=J et al|title=Ten principles for a landscape approach to reconciling agriculture, conservation, and other competing land uses|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA|date=2013|volume=110|issue=21|pages=8349–8356|doi=10.1073/pnas.1210595110|url=http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/articles/ASunderland1302.pdf|pmc=3666687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Five Elements of Integrated Landscape Management''' describe the implementation cycle of a landscape approach, namely that: "interested stakeholders in the landscape come together for cooperative dialogue and action in a multi-stakeholder platform (1); they undertake a systematic process to exchange information and discuss perspectives to achieve a shared understanding of the landscape conditions, challenges and opportunities (2); this enables collaborative planning to develop an agreed action plan (3); stakeholders then implement the plan, with attention to maintaining collaborative commitments (4); and finally, monitoring for adaptive management and accountability feeds into subsequent rounds of dialogue and the design of new collaborative action (5)".&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt; These five elements can be presented graphically in a circle, similar to the project management cycle.

== Risks and barriers ==
Despite many examples of implementation, and the interest of many public and private sector organisations (see for example participation at global fora on landscapes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Landscape Forum - the Investment Case speakers|url=http://www.landscapes.org/london-2016/speakers/|website=Global Landscape Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Global Landscapes Forum Final Report|url=http://www.landscapes.org/publication/2014-global-landscapes-forum-final-report/|website=Global Landscapes Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;), there are various barriers and risks around landscape approaches. An extensive literature review&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt; identified five main barriers.

The first is '''terminology confusion''': the variety of definitions creates the potential for not only confusion, but also resistance to engage with an approach that has emerged, often somewhat independently, from different fields.&lt;ref name="Reed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt; As stated by Scherr et al.: “People are talking about the same thing without realizing it. This can lead to fragmentation of knowledge, unnecessary re-invention of ideas and practices, and inability to mobilize action at scale. For policymakers, this rich diversity is often simply overwhelming: they receive confusing messages as to what an enabling policy environment to address the full set of landscape values would look like.”&lt;ref name="Scherr" /&gt;

These risks are far from unique to landscape approaches: since the 1970s it has been recognised that the constant emergence of new terms and labels from efforts to improve and integrate policy and practice for rural areas of developing countries can be harmful if they obscure problems or promote rhetoric at the expense of action.&lt;ref name="ODI"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Overseas Development Institute|title=Integrated Rural Development|journal=ODI Briefing Paper|date=1979|issue=04|url=https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/6626.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that landscapes approaches develop from, and aim to integrate, a wide variety of concepts and sectors, makes it vulnerable to overlapping definitions and parallel conceptual development. Like other approaches to conservation, it could be seen as a fad.&lt;ref name="fads"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Redford|first1=K|last2=Padoch|first2=C|last3=Sunderland|first3=T|title=Fads, funding and forgetting in three decades of conservation|journal=Conservation Biology|date=2013|volume=27|issue=3|pages=437–438|doi=10.1111/cobi.12071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further barriers to implementation have been identified. As has been the case with other integrated approaches, '''time lags''' result from the fact that substantial time and resources are invested both in developing concepts and planning projects, while resources are less adequate for implementation, and more limited still for monitoring the outcomes.&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sayer" /&gt; Difficulties in establishing objectives, operating norms and funding that effectively bridge different sectors can lead to '''operating silos'''(where each sector pursues its goals without giving consideration to the others), whether at the level of local actors and institutions within a landscape, national ministries, or donors.&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt; Working across sectors at the landscape scale requires a range of skills, different from those traditionally used by conservation organisations.&lt;ref name="Sayer" /&gt;  Landscape approaches rely on the engagement of multiple stakeholders, which can lead to problems of '''Internal/external engagement''',&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reed" /&gt; if engagement is reduced to a box-ticking exercise or inaccessible to community participants,&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt; or powerful players such as government agencies or large companies can be deterred by a perception that there is too much participatory discussion at the expense of efficient decision-making&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt; The least developed area of landscape approaches is '''monitoring''', to understand whether the ambitious, multiple objectives of the approach have been achieved.&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt;

== Examples ==
Examples of landscape approaches are collated and analysed globally&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Minang" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landscapes for People Food and nature case studies http://peoplefoodandnature.org/analysis/all-publications/case-studies/&lt;/ref&gt; or regionally, for example from Africa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milder|first1=J C|last2=Hart|first2=A K|last3=Dobie|first3=P|last4=Minai|first4=J|last5=Zaleski|first5=C|title=Integrated landscape initiatives for Afircan agriculture, development, and conservation: a region-wide assessment|journal=World Development|date=2014|volume=54|pages=68–80|doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2013.07.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Estrada-Carmona|first1=N|last2=Hart|first2=A K|last3=Declerk|first3=F A J|last4=Harvey|first4=C A|last5=Milder|first5=J C|title=Integrated landscape management for agriculture, rural livelihoods, and ecosystem conservation: an assessment of experience from Latin America and the Caribbean|journal=Landscape and urban planning|date=2014|volume=129|pages=1–11|doi=10.1016/j.landurbplan.2014.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; International organisations have developed programmes that apply the approach to multiple locations worldwide (for example, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] Livelihoods and Landscapes Strategies programme worked in 27 landscapes in 23 different countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Livelihoods and Landscapes|url=https://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/forest/fp_our_work/fp_projects/fp_our_work_ll/fp_livelihoods_landscapes_about/|publisher=IUCN}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Some specific examples of implementation in individual landscapes are as follows.

An example of an indigenous producer movement that is managing a multi-functional landscape is from the [[Potato Park]] in Pisac, Peru, which is an Indigenous Biocultural Heritage Territory, where indigenous communities protect the ecological and cultural diversity of the 12000ha landscape.&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt;

An example of cooperation between very different actors is from the landscape of the [[Doi Mae Salong]] watershed in North-west Thailand, a designated Military Reserved Area under the control of the Royal Thai Armed Forces. Reforestation activities, to address degradation caused by unsustainable land uses, led to tension with local hill tribes. In response, a multi-stakeholder dialogue was used to reach agreement on land rights and use of different parts of the reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fisher|first1=R J|last2=Kugel|first2=C|last3=Rattanasorn|first3=T|title=Unusual partnerships : lessons for landscapes and livelihoods from the Doe Mae Salong landscape, Thailand.|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10215|website=IUCN|publisher=IUCN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wide image|2014 June 1, Mae Fa Luang District.jpg|1000px|Landscape near the Doi Mae Salong mountain in 2014}}

The [[Mount Kailash]] region is of particular religious and ecological importance, as it is here that the [[Indus River]], the [[Karnali River]] (a major tributary of the [[Ganges River]]), the [[Brahmaputra River]] and the [[Sutlej]] river systems originate. With assistance from the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), the three surrounding countries (China, India and Nepal) developed an integrated management approach to the different conservation and development issues within this landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wallrapp|first1=C|title=Transboundary landscape management in the Kailash Sacred Landscape|url=http://peoplefoodandnature.org/blog/transboundary-landscape-management-in-the-kailash-sacred-landscape/|publisher=Landscapes for People Food and Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Volta River]] basin, [[landscape modelling]] illustrates the cause and effect of alternative scenarios for the riparian buffer, and is used to inform land-use decisions.

The '''Interlock System''' is [[R. Talsorian Games]]' proprietary role-playing system.

==History==
Interlock was a game system by [[R. Talsorian Games]] based on a simple ‘die + bonus’ system, using a d10.&lt;ref name="designers"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|208}} ''[[Mekton II]]'' (1987) – the 3rd edition of R. Talsorian's mecha game – revealed for the first time the full-fledged Interlock system. Interlock featured point-based characters with a character background system that had appeared in ''[[Mekton]]'', though in a more complex and comprehensive form called Lifepaths.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|208}} ''[[Cyberpunk 2013]]'' (1988) was R. Talsorian's second Interlock design.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|208}} ''Cyberpunk'' expanded the original Interlock system by introducing a new combat system called "Friday Night Firefight". The second edition of the game, ''[[Cyberpunk 2020]]'' (1990), polished up the Interlock system once more, producing what is now known as "Standard Interlock".&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|209}}

Interlock is one of the direct parents of the [[Fuzion]] system (the other is the [[Hero System]]).  The Interlock System is "skill-based"&amp;mdash;characters are created by choosing skills for them, and by advancing those skills individually, rather than by choosing [[character class]] packages.  The Interlock System is used primarily in the ''[[Cyberpunk 2020]]'' and ''[[Mekton]]'' role-playing games. A variant of the Interlock System is used in ''[[Teenagers from Outer Space (role-playing game)|Teenagers from Outer Space]]'' and the Japanese ''[[Gundam Senki]]'' RPG.

==System==
[[Ability score|Stats]] and skills are both rated on a scale of 0-10 with 0 representing no ability/no training and 10 representing the maximum ability possible for a human being.  A typical skill roll will range from 12-20 for most tasks, so a skill 10 + stat 10 will succeed at virtually any task barring a critical mishap, while a skill 0 + stat 2 (minimum statistic level for a human character) will fail at any but the very simplest task, and even then will succeed only on a critical success.  Interlock builds on the typical skill-based paradigm by offering "template" (Mekton) or "profession" (Cyberpunk) packages that give specialized abilities to characters that take these packages.

There are nine Attributes: Intelligence (INT), Reflexes (REF), Cool (COOL), Technical Ability (TECH), Luck (LUCK), Attractiveness (ATT), Movement (MOVE), Empathy (EMP), and Body (BOD). Characters must have a starting Attribute stat minimum of 2 and a system stat maximum of 10. 

In ''Cyberpunk'' and ''Cybergeneration'' Empathy is very important. It not only controls interpersonal interactions but it also determines how much cyberware you can install. Every piece of cyberware has a Humanity Cost that reduces the character's base Empathy. A rating of "0" or less means the character has become psychotic and can no longer be played.

The Interlock System is best known for its ''Lifepath'' system, a storytelling device used to create character backgrounds without particular direct benefit or drawback to the character, avoiding [[min-maxing]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3601">The '''International Violence Against Women Act of 2015''' ('''I-VAWA''') is proposed legislation to address [[violence against women]] through [[United States]] foreign policy.  The legislation was introduced in the [[114th United States Congress]] in March, 2015. Similar legislation was introduced in the [[110th United States Congress|110th]] and [[111th United States Congress]] but was not passed into law.

==Background==
At least 1 in 3 women around the world are subject to [[sexual abuse|sexual]], [[physical abuse|physical]] or other [[abuse]] during their life, per estimates by the [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]].  Not only does violence against women prevent mothers from raising healthy children, it also affects the economic progress and stability within the country in which they live.&lt;ref name=AI-IssueBrief&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/ivawa_ib2.pdf ''The International Violence Against Women Act (I-VAWA) (S.2982, HR. 4594)''.] [[Amnesty International]] Issue Brief No. 2. March 2010. Retrieved November 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Violence Against Women Act of 2015==
The International Violence Against Women Act of 2015 (I-VAWA) (S.713, HR. 1340) was introduced to ensure that addressing violence against women is included in the nation's foreign policy, with best practices for  preventing violence, protecting victims and prosecuting offenders.&lt;ref name=AI-IssueBrief/&gt;

The legislation was the result of efforts by:
* [[Amnesty International USA]]
* [[Family Violence Prevention Fund]]
* [[Women Thrive Worldwide]].&lt;ref name=AI-IssueBrief/&gt;

Experts in related fields from 40 international and 150 U.S. groups provided input for the legislation.&lt;ref name=AI-IssueBrief/&gt;

The House of Representatives Bill (HR. 1340) was brought before the [[114th_United_States_Congress|114th Congress]], sponsored by Representative [[Jan_Schakowsky|Janice Schakowsky]], [[Illinois's 9th congressional district]]. The Senate Bill (S.713), was introduced by Senator [[Barbara Boxer]] of [[California]].

==Criticism==
I-VAWA has been criticized on the grounds that it would discriminate against male victims and impose Western values upon other societies.  According to [[Wendy McElroy]], a research fellow at [[The Independent Institute]], the Act "constitutes a 5-year redirection of foreign aid funds in order to insert politically-correct feminism into the structure of other nations" and "revictimizes every male victim by denying his existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/civil-rights/197947-i-vawas-global-lie|last=McElroy|first=Wendy|title=I-VAWA's global lie|journal=The Hill|date=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
Many organizations support the I-VAWA Act, some of which are:

* [[American Jewish World Service]]
* [[Human Rights Watch]]
* [[International Center for Research on Women]]
* [[International Rescue Committee]]
* [[Refugees International]]

'''Jackson structured programming''' ('''JSP''') is a method for [[structured programming]] based on correspondences between data stream structure and program structure.  JSP structures programs and data in terms of sequences, iterations and selections, and as a consequence it is applied when designing a program's detailed control structure. The method applies to processing of any data structure or data stream that is describable as a hierarchical structure of sequential, optional and iterated elements. This could be a stream of messages that a process reads to invoke and coordinate other modules or objects, or it could be a string of characters in parameters passed to a single operation on an "object" coded in an object-oriented programming language. In other words, it could be either above or below the level where [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented methods]] are applied &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = R | last = Wieringa  | title = A survey of structured and object-oriented software specification methods and techniques | publisher = ACM | journal = Comput Surv | volume = 30 | issue = 4 |date=Dec 1998 | pages = 459–527 | url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/299917.299919 | doi=10.1145/299917.299919}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Brian | last1 = Henderson-Sellers | author1-link = Brian Henderson-Sellers | first2 = JM | last2 = Edwards  | title = The object-oriented systems life cycle | journal = Commun | publisher = ACM | volume = 33 | issue = 9 |date=Sep 1990 | pages = 142–59 | url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/83880.84529 | doi=10.1145/83880.84529}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
[[Michael A. Jackson]] originally developed JSP in the 1970s. He documented the system in his 1975 book ''Principles of Program Design''.&lt;ref name="PoPD"&gt;{{Citation | first = MA | last = Jackson | title = Principles of Program Design | publisher = Academic | year = 1975}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2001 conference talk,&lt;ref name="perspective"&gt;{{Citation | first = MA | last = Jackson | title = JSP in Perspective | place = sd&amp;m Pioneers’ Conference, Bonn, June 2001 | year=2001 | url = http://mcs.open.ac.uk/mj665/JSPPers1.pdf | access-date = 2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; he provided a retrospective analysis of the original driving forces behind the method, and related it to subsequent software engineering developments. Jackson's aim was to make [[COBOL]] batch file processing programs easier to modify and maintain, but the method can be used to design programs for any [[programming language]] that has structured control constructs, languages such as [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Perl]]. Despite its age, JSP is still in use and is supported by diagramming tools such as Microsoft's Visio and CASE tools such as Jackson Workbench.&lt;ref name= "Ourusoff 2003"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.proceedings.informingscience.org/IS2003Proceedings/docs/091Ourus.pdf|title = Using Jackson Structured Programming (JSP) and Jackson Workbench to Teach Program Design | accessdate = 2017-01-16 | publisher =Informing Science|year= 2003| first =Nicholas | last = Ourusoff|work= InSite 2003 | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson Structured Programming was seen by many as related&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = KT | last = Orr | year = 1980 | contribution = Structured programming in the 1980s | title = Proceedings of the ACM 1980 Annual Conference | publisher = ACM Press | place = New York, NY | pages = 323–26 | url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/800176.809987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Warnier/Orr Diagrams|Warnier structured programming]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = JD | last = Warnier | year = 1974 | title = Logical Construction of Programs | publisher = Van Nostrand Reinhold | place = NY}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but the latter method focused almost exclusively on the structure of the output stream.  JSP and Warnier's method both structure programs and data using only sequences, iterations and selections, so they essentially create programs that are [[parser]]s for [[regular expression]]s which simultaneously match the program's input and output data streams.

Because JSP focuses on the existing input and output data streams, designing a program using JSP is claimed to be more straightforward than with other structured programming methods, avoiding the leaps of intuition needed to successfully program using methods such as top-down decomposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Sorensen | first1 = K | last2 = Verelst | first2 = J | title = On the conversion of program specifications into pseudo code using Jackson structured programming | journal = Journal of Computing and Information Technology | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | year = 2001 | pages = 71–80 | doi=10.2498/cit.2001.01.06}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another consequence of JSP's focus on data streams is that it creates program designs with a very different structure to the kind created by the stepwise refinement methods of [[Niklaus Wirth|Wirth]] and [[Edsger Dijkstra|Dijkstra]].  One typical feature of the structure of JSP programs is that they have several input operations distributed throughout the code in contrast to programs designed using stepwise refinement, which tend to have only one input operation. Jackson illustrates this difference in Chapter 3 of ''Principles of Program Design''.&lt;ref name="PoPD"/&gt;  He presents two versions of a program, one designed using JSP, the other using "traditional" methods.

== Structural equivalent ==
For an example comparing Jackson Structured Programming to "traditional" structured programming, let us consider a Java program to count repeated lines in a file.

The JSP version of the program is structurally equivalent to

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
String line;

line = in.readLine();
while (line != null) {
    int count = 0;
    String firstLineOfGroup = line;

    while (line != null &amp;&amp; line.equals(firstLineOfGroup)) {
        count++;
        line = in.readLine();
    }
    System.out.println(firstLineOfGroup + " " + count);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

and the traditional version of the program is equivalent to

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
String line;

int count = 0;
String firstLineOfGroup = null;
while ((line = in.readLine()) != null) {
    if (firstLineOfGroup == null
            || !line.equals(firstLineOfGroup)) {
        if (firstLineOfGroup != null) {
            System.out.println(firstLineOfGroup + " " + count);
        }
        count = 0;
        firstLineOfGroup = line;
    }
    count++;
}
if (firstLineOfGroup != null) {
    System.out.println(firstLineOfGroup + " " + count);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Jackson criticises the traditional version, claiming that it hides the relationships which exist between the input lines, compromising the program's understandability and maintainability by, for example, forcing the use of a special case for the first line and forcing another special case for a final output operation.

== The method ==
JSP uses semi-formal steps to capture the existing structure of a program's inputs and outputs in the structure of the program itself.

The intent is to create programs which are easy to modify over their lifetime.  Jackson's major insight was that requirement changes are usually minor tweaks to the existing structures.  For a program constructed using JSP, the inputs, the outputs, and the internal structures of the program all match, so small changes to the inputs and outputs should translate into small changes to the program.

JSP structures programs in terms of four component types:

* fundamental operations
* sequences
* iterations
* selections

The method begins by describing a program's inputs in terms of the four fundamental component types.  It then goes on to describe the program's outputs in the same way.  Each input and output is modelled as a separate [[Data structure diagram|Data Structure Diagram]] (DSD).  To make JSP work for compute-intensive applications, such as digital signal processing (DSP) it is also necessary to draw algorithm structure diagrams, which focus on internal data structures rather than input and output ones.

The input and output structures are then unified or merged into a final program structure, known as a Program Structure Diagram (PSD).  This step may involve the addition of a small amount of high level control structure to marry up the inputs and outputs.  Some programs process all the input before doing any output, whilst others  read in one record, write one record and iterate.  Such approaches have to be captured in the PSD.

The PSD, which is language neutral, is then implemented in a programming language.  JSP is geared towards programming at the level of control structures, so the implemented designs use just primitive operations, sequences, iterations and selections.  JSP is not used to structure programs at the level of classes and objects, although it can helpfully structure [[control flow]] within a class's methods.

JSP uses a diagramming notation to describe the structure of inputs, outputs and programs, with diagram elements for each of the fundamental component types.

A simple operation is drawn as a box.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Element Jackson.png|A box labeled 'A']]&lt;br&gt;An operation&lt;/center&gt;

A sequence of operations is represented by boxes connected with lines.  In the example below, operation A consists of the sequence of operations B, C and D.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:JSP Sequence.png|A box labeled 'A' connected to three boxes below it labeled 'B', 'C' and 'D']]&lt;br&gt;A sequence&lt;/center&gt;

An iteration is again represented with joined boxes.  In addition the iterated operation has a star in the top right corner of its box.  In the example below, operation A consists of an iteration of zero or more invocations of operation B.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:JSP Iteration.png|A box labeled 'A' connected to a box labeled 'B' below it with a star in the top right corner]]&lt;br&gt;An iteration&lt;/center&gt;

Selection is similar to a sequence, but with a circle drawn in the top right hand corner of each optional operation.  In the example, operation A consists of one and only one of operations B, C or D.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:JSP Selection.png|A box labeled 'A' connected to three boxes below it labeled 'B', 'C' and 'D' each with a circle in the top right hand corner]]&lt;br&gt;A selection&lt;/center&gt;

==A worked example==

As an example, here is how a programmer would design and code a [[Run-length encoding|run length encoder]] using JSP.

A run length encoder is a program which takes as its input a stream of bytes.  It outputs a stream of pairs consisting of a byte along with a count of the byte's consecutive occurrences.  Run length encoders are often used for crudely compressing bitmaps.

With JSP, the first step is to describe the structure of a program's inputs.  A run length encoder has only one input, a stream of bytes which can be viewed as zero or more ''runs''.  Each run consists of one or more bytes of the same value.  This is represented by the following JSP diagram.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:JSP RLE input.png]]&lt;br&gt;The run length encoder input&lt;/center&gt;

The second step is to describe the structure of the output.  The run length encoder output can be described as zero or more pairs, each pair consisting of a byte and its count.  In this example, the count will also be a byte.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:JSP RLE output1.png]]&lt;br&gt;The run length encoder output&lt;/center&gt;

The next step is to describe the correspondences between the operations in the input and output structures.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:JSP RLE correspondence.png]]&lt;br&gt;The correspondences between the run length encoders inputs and its outputs&lt;/center&gt;

It is at this stage that the astute programmer may encounter a ''structure clash'', in which there is no obvious correspondence between the input and output structures.  If a structure clash is found, it is usually resolved by splitting the program into two parts, using an intermediate data structure to provide a common structural framework with which the two program parts can communicate.  The two programs parts are often implemented as [[Process (computing)|processes]] or [[coroutine]]s.

In this example, there is no structure clash, so the two structures can be merged to give the final program structure.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:JSP RLE program.png]]&lt;br&gt;The run length encoder program structure&lt;/center&gt;

At this stage the program can be fleshed out by hanging various primitive operations off the elements of the structure.  Primitives which suggest themselves are

# read a byte
# remember byte
# set counter to zero
# increment counter
# output remembered byte
# output counter

The iterations also have to be fleshed out. They need conditions added. Suitable conditions would be

# while there are more bytes
# while there are more bytes and this byte is the same as the run's first byte and the count will still fit in a byte

If we put all this together, we can convert the diagram and the primitive operations into C, maintaining a one-to-one correspondence between the code and the operations and structure of the program design diagram.

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int c;

    c = getchar();
    while (c != EOF) {
        int count = 1;

        int first_byte = c;

        c = getchar();

        while (c != EOF &amp;&amp; c == first_byte &amp;&amp; count &lt; 255) {
            count++;
            c = getchar();
        }

        putchar(first_byte);
        putchar(count);
    }
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Luminous mind''' ([[Sanskrit|Skt:]] ''prabhāsvara-citta'' or ''ābhāsvara-citta,'' [[Pali]]: ''pabhassara citta;'' [[Tibetic languages|T.]] ''’od gsal gyi sems;'' [[Chinese language|C.]] ''guangmingxin;'' [[Japanese language|J.]] ''kōmyōshin;'' [[Korean language|K.]] ''kwangmyŏngsim'') is a Buddhist term which appears in a [[Suttas|sutta]] of the [[Pali]] [[Anguttara Nikaya]] as well as numerous [[Mahayana sutras|Mahayana]] texts and [[Buddhist Tantras|Buddhist tantras]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Buswell Jr., Donald S. Lopez Jr., The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism, p. 653.&lt;/ref&gt; It is variously translated as "brightly shining mind", or "mind of clear light" while the related term '''luminosity''' (Skt. ''prabhāsvaratā;'' Tib.''’od gsal ba;'' Ch. ''guāng míng;'' Jpn. ''kōmyō;'' Kor. ''kwangmyōng'') is also translated as "clear light" in Tibetan Buddhist contexts or, "purity" in East Asian contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Casey Alexandra Kemp, Luminosity, Oxford Bibliographies, LAST MODIFIED: 26 MAY 2016 DOI: 10.1093/OBO/9780195393521-0219&lt;/ref&gt; The term is usually used to describe the mind or consciousness in different ways. 

This term is given no direct doctrinal explanation in the Pali discourses, but later Buddhist schools explained it using various concepts developed by them.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, page 99.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Theravada]] school identifies the "luminous mind" with the ''[[bhavanga]]'', a concept first proposed in the Theravada [[Abhidhamma]].&lt;ref&gt;Collins, page 238.&lt;/ref&gt; The later schools of the [[Mahayana]] identify it with both the Mahayana concepts of ''[[bodhicitta]]'' and ''[[tathagatagarbha]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, page 99.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion is of central importance in the philosophy and practice of [[Dzogchen]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Contemplative Science, Columbia, 2007, pages 94-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Luminosity in Early Buddhist Texts ==

In the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] there are various mentions of luminosity or radiance which refer to the development of the mind in [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]]. In the ''Saṅgīti-sutta'' for example, it relates to the attainment of [[samadhi]], where the perception of light (''āloka sañña'') leads to a mind endowed with luminescence (''sappabhāsa'').&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Analayo, the ''Upakkilesa-sutta'' and its parallels mention that the presence of defilements "results in a loss of whatever inner light or luminescence (obhāsa) had been experienced during meditation".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Pali ''Dhātuvibhaṅga-sutta'' uses the metaphor of refining gold to describe equanimity reached through meditation, which is said to be "pure, bright, soft, workable, and luminous".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Chinese parallel to this text however does not describe equanimity as luminous.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Analayo sees this difference due to the propensity of the reciters of the Theravada canon to prefer fire and light imagery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

The Pali [[Anguttara Nikaya]] (A.I.8-10) states:&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, page 94. The reference is at A I, 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"Luminous, monks, is the mind. And it is freed from incoming defilements. The well-instructed disciple of the noble ones discerns that as it actually is present, which is why I tell you that — for the well-instructed disciple of the noble ones — there is development of the mind."&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an01/an01.049.than.html].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;A parallel passage can be found in the [[Śāriputrābhidharma|''Śāriputrābhidharma'']], an [[Abhidharma]] treatise possibly of the Dharmaguptaka tradition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Another mention of a similar term in the Pali discourses occurs in the ''Brahmanimantaṇika-sutta'' of the [[Majjhima Nikaya|Majjhima-nikāya]] and in the ''Kevaḍḍha-sutta'' of the ''[[Digha Nikaya|Dīgha-nikāya]],'' the latter has a parallel in a [[Dharmaguptaka]] collection surviving in Chinese translation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Anālayo, The Luminous Mind in Theravāda and Dharmaguptaka Discourses, Journal for the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies 2017 (13): 10-51.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Brahmanimantaṇika-sutta'' describes an “invisible consciousness” (viññāṇaṃ anidassanaṃ) that is "infinite” (anantaṃ), and “luminous in every way” (sabbato pabhaṃ). However, there is disagreement among the various [[Pāli Canon|Pali Canon]] editions as to whom the statement is spoken by, and in some editions it seems as if it is spoken not by the Buddha but by the deva Baka Brahma in a debate with the Buddha.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Chinese parallel to the ''Brahmanimantaṇika-sutta'' has the term used by Baka Brahma.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;

The ''Kevaḍḍha-sutta'' &amp;nbsp;and its parallel in the [[Dharmaguptaka]] Dīrgha-āgama meanwhile, does have a statement spoken by the Buddha which mentions luminous consciousness. The [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Dīrgha-āgama]] sutra states:&lt;blockquote&gt;Consciousness that is invisible, Infinite, and luminous of its own: This ceasing, the four elements cease, Coarse and subtle, pretty and ugly cease. Herein name-and-form cease. Consciousness ceasing, the remainder [i.e. name-and-form] also ceases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;However, [[Bhikkhu Analayo|Analayo]] mentions that parallel recensions of this sutra in other languages like Sanskrit and Tibetan do not mention luminosity (''pabhaṃ'') and even the various Pali editions do not agree that this verse mentions luminosity, sometimes using ''pahaṃ'' ( "given up") instead of ''pabhaṃ''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Whatever the case, according to Analayo, the passage refers to "the cessation mode of dependent arising, according to which name-and-form cease with the cessation of consciousness".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to Bhikkhu Brahmāli, the references to luminosity in the ''Brahmanimantaṇika-sutta'' refers to states of [[samadhi]] known only to [[Four stages of enlightenment|ariyas (noble ones)]], while the ''pabhassaracitta'' of [[Anguttara Nikaya]] (A.I.8-10) is a reference to the mind in [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhana]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Bhikkhu Brahmali, What the Nikāyas Say and Do not Say about Nibbāna, Buddhist Studies Review.&lt;/ref&gt; He cites a common passage which notes that the mind with the five hindrances is not considered radiant and thus it makes sense to say that a mind in jhana, which does not have the five hindrances, can be said to be radiant:
&lt;blockquote&gt;So too, bhikkhus, there are these five corruptions of the mind (''cittassa''), corrupted by which the mind is neither malleable nor wieldy nor radiant (''pabhassaraṃ'') but brittle and not rightly concentrated for the destruction of the taints. What five? Sensual desire ... ill will ... sloth and torpor ... restlessness and remorse ... doubt is a corruption of the mind, corrupted by which the mind is neither malleable nor wieldy nor radiant but brittle and not rightly concentrated for the destruction of the taints. (SN V 92 and A III 16, cf. AN I 257 and MN III 243).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== In Theravada ==
{{Main|Bhavanga}}

The [[Theravada|Theravadin]] Anguttara Nikaya [[Atthakatha]] commentary identifies the luminous mind as the ''[[bhavanga]]'', the "ground of becoming" or "latent dynamic continuum", which is the most fundamental level of mental functioning in the Theravada [[Abhidhamma|Abhidhammic]] scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, page 98.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation is also used by [[Buddhaghoṣa|Buddhaghosa]], in his commentary on the [[Dhammasangani]]. Buddhaghosa also mentions that the mind is made luminous by the fourth jhana in his [[Visuddhimagga]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;'''Skorupski, Tadeusz. “Consciousness and Luminosity in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism.” In''' ''Buddhist Philosophy and Meditation Practice: Academic Papers Presented at the 2nd IABU Conference Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya University, Main Campus Wang Noi, Ayutthaya, Thailand, 31 May–2 June 2012'''''.''' &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] holds that the commentaries' identification of the luminous mind with the ''bhavanga'' is problematic,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an01/an01.049.than.html Pabhassara Sutta: Luminous] Note #1.&lt;/ref&gt; but Peter Harvey finds it to be a plausible interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, pages 98-99. See also pages 155-179 of Harvey2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ajahn Mun]], the leading figure behind the modern [[Thai Forest Tradition]], comments on this verse:

{{quote|The mind is something more radiant than anything else can be, but because counterfeits – passing defilements – come and obscure it, it loses its radiance, like the sun when obscured by clouds. Don’t go thinking that the sun goes after the clouds. Instead, the clouds come drifting along and obscure the sun. So meditators, when they know in this manner, should do away with these counterfeits by analyzing them shrewdly... When they develop the mind to the stage of the primal mind, this will mean that all counterfeits are destroyed, or rather, counterfeit things won’t be able to reach into the primal mind, because the bridge making the connection will have been destroyed. Even though the mind may then still have to come into contact with the preoccupations of the world, its contact will be like that of a bead of water rolling over a lotus leaf.&lt;ref&gt;Ven. Ajahn Mun, ‘A Heart Released,’ p 23. Found in Ajahn Pasanno and Ajahn Amaro, ''The Island: An Anthology of the Buddha’s Teachings on Nibbāna'', pages 212-213. Available online at [http://www.abhayagiri.org/main/book/1788/].&lt;/ref&gt;}}[[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] sees the luminous mind as "the mind that the meditator is trying to develop. To perceive its luminosity means understanding that defilements such as greed, aversion, or delusion are not intrinsic to its nature, are not a necessary part of awareness." He associates the term with the simile used to describe the fourth [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhana]] which states:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Just as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend; even so, the monk sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure, bright awareness."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Other Buddhist schools ==
According to Tadeusz Skorupski, the [[Mahāsāṃghika|Mahasamghika]] school held that the mind’s nature (''cittasvabhva'') is fundamentally pure (''mulavisuddha''), but it can be contaminated by adventitious defilements.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In contrast, the [[Sarvastivada]] [[Vaibhāṣika|Vaibhasikas]] held that the mind was not naturally luminous. According to Skorupski for the [[Vaibhāṣika|Vaibhasikas]], the mind:&lt;blockquote&gt;is initially or originally contaminated by defilements, and must be purified by abandoning defilements. For them a primordially luminous mind cannot be contaminated by adventitious defilements. If such a mind were contaminated by adventitious defilements, then these naturally impure defilements would become pure once they become associated with the naturally luminous mind. On the other hand, if adventitious defilements remained to be impure, then a naturally luminous mind would not become defiled by their presence. For them the constantly evolving mind is in possession of defilements.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== In Mahayana Buddhism ==
{{Main|Mahayana}}In [[Sanskrit]] Mahayana texts and their translations, the term is a compound of the intensifying prefix ''pra-'', the verbal root ''bhāsa'' (Tibetan:  '''od'') which means light, radiance or luminosity and the modifier ''vara'' (Tibetan: ''gsal ba'') which means 'clear,' and also 'the best of, the highest type.'&lt;ref&gt;Tony Duff, ''The Illuminator'' Tibetan Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffrey Hopkins' Tibetan-Sanskrit dictionary glosses the term compound as:&lt;blockquote&gt;clear light; clearly luminous; transparently luminous; translucent; brightly shining; transparent lucidity; splendor; radiance; illumination; spread the light; lustre; come to hear; effulgence; brilliance.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Hopkins, Tibetan-Sanskrit-English Dictionary Digital version: Digital Archives Section, Library and Information Center of Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教學院 圖書資訊館 數位典藏組&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Mahayana texts ===
[[Mahayana sutras]] generally affirm the pure and luminous nature of the mind, adding that this is its natural condition (''prakrti-prabhsvara-citta'').&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In the ''Pañcavimsati [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñaparamita]] sutra'', the ''prabhsvara-citta'' is interpreted thus'':''&lt;blockquote&gt;This mind (citta) is no-mind (acitta), because its natural character is luminous. What is this state of the mind’s luminosity (prabhsvarat)? When the mind is neither associated with nor dissociated from greed, hatred, delusion, proclivities (anusaya), fetters (samyojana), or false views (drsti), then this constitutes its luminosity. Does the mind exist as no-mind? In the state of no-mind (acittat), the states of existence (astit) or non-existence (nstit) can be neither found nor established... What is this state of no-mind? The state of no-mind, which is immutable (avikra) and undifferentiated (avikalpa), constitutes the ultimate reality (dharmat) of all dharmas. Such is the state of no-mind.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A similar teaching appears in some recensions of the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā'' (8000 lines) ''Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra.'' [[Edward Conze]] considered the teaching on the "essential purity of the nature of mind"  (''prakrti cittasya prabhasvara''; ''xinxiang benjing'', 心相本淨) to be a central teaching of the Mahayana. However according to Shi Huifeng, this term is not present in the earliest textual witness of the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā'', the ''Daoxing Banruo Jing'', attributed to [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]] (c. 179 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Huifeng Shi, An Annotated English Translation of Kumārajīva’s Xiaŏpĭn Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra, Asian Literature and Translation Vol. 4, No 1, 2017, 187-236.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahayana texts like the [[Ratnagotravibhāga|Ratnagotravibhanga]], also associate ''prabhsvara'' with awakening (''bodhi'') and also another term, natural or original purity of mind (''cittaprakrtivisuddhi'').&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Busswell, 2004, Encyclopedia of Buddhism, page 52.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul, Altruism and Reality: Studies in the Philosophy of the Bodhicaryavatara, page 10&lt;/ref&gt; In some Mahayana shastras, natural purity is another term for [[Śūnyatā|Emptiness]], Suchness and [[Dharmadhatu]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholz, Karl, When the Clouds Part: The Uttaratantra and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Shambhala, 2015, page 1023.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asanga|Asanga's]] [[Mahāyānasaṃgraha|Mahayanasamgraha]] for example, states:&lt;blockquote&gt;The essential purity (''prakṛtivyavadāna''), i.e., the true nature (''tathatā''), emptiness (''śūnyatā''), the utmost point of reality (''bhūtakoti''), the signless (''animitta''), the absolute (''paramārtha''), the fundamental element (''dharmadhātu'').&lt;ref&gt;Lamotte, Étienne , MAHĀYĀNASAṂGRAHA (La Somme du Grand Véhicule d'Asaṅga), Volume II,  page 165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The ''Bhadrapala-sutra'' states that the element of consciousness (''vijñanadhatu'') is pure and penetrates all things while not being affected by them, like the rays of the sun, even though it may appear defiled.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Alaya-vijñana ===
According to [[Walpola Rahula]], all the elements of the [[Yogacara]] [[store-consciousness]] (''alaya-vijnana'') are already found in the Pali Canon.&lt;ref&gt;Padmasiri De Silva, Robert Henry Thouless, ''Buddhist and Freudian Psychology.'' Third revised edition published by NUS Press, 1992 page 66.&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that the three layers of the mind (''citta'', called "luminous" in the passage discussed above, ''manas'', and ''vijnana'') as presented by Asanga are also used in the Pali Canon.&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, quoted in Padmasiri De Silva, Robert Henry Thouless, ''Buddhist and Freudian Psychology.'' Third revised edition published by NUS Press, 1992 page 66, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4Fb0q9bKJjIC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=development+of+the+theory+of+karma+buddhism&amp;lr=#PPA66,M1].&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[Yogacara]] teachings, as in early Buddhist teachings regarding the ''citta'', the store-consciousness is ''not'' pure, and with the attainment of nirvana comes a level of mental purity that is hitherto unattained.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Lusthaus, ''Buddhist Phenomenology.'' Routledge, 2002, note 7 on page 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Svasaṃvedana===
{{main|Svasaṃvedana}}
In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the luminous mind (Tibetan: ''gsal ba'') is often equated with the Yogacara concept of [[svasaṃvedana]] (''reflexive awareness''). It is often compared to a lamp in a dark room, which in the act of illuminating objects in the room also illuminates itself.

=== Tathagatagarbha ===
{{Main|Tathagatagarbha}}
In the canonical discourses, when the brightly shining ''citta'' is "unstained," it is supremely poised for ''arahantship'', and so could be conceived as the "womb" of the ''arahant'', for which a synonym is ''[[tathagata]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, page 96.&lt;/ref&gt; The discourses do not support seeing the "luminous mind" as "nirvana within" which exists prior to liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, pages 94, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Canon does not support the identification of the "luminous mind" in its raw state with [[Nirvana#Luminous consciousness|nirvanic consciousness]], passages could be taken to imply that it can be transformed into the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, page 97. He finds the reference at S III, 54, taking into account statements at S II, 13, S II, 4, and S III, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an01/an01.049.than.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the destruction of the fetters, according to one scholar, "the shining nibbanic consciousness flashes out of the womb of arahantship, being without object or support, so transcending all limitations."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, page 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the [[Shurangama Sutra]] and the [[Lankavatara Sutra]] describe the ''[[tathagatagarbha]]'' ("arahant womb") &amp;nbsp;as "by nature brightly shining and pure," and "originally pure," though "enveloped in the garments of the [[skandhas]], [[dhatus]] and [[ayatana]]s and soiled with the dirt of attachment, hatred, delusion and false imagining." It is said to be "naturally pure," but it appears impure as it is stained by adventitious defilements.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, pages 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the Lankavatara Sutra identifies the luminous mind of the Canon with the tathagatagarbha.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, page 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Gelug]] philosophers, in contrast to teachings in the Lankavatara Sutra, maintain that the "purity" of the ''tathagatagarbha'' is not because it is originally or fundamentally pure, but because mental flaws can be removed — that is, like anything else, they are not part of an individual's fundamental essence. These thinkers thus refuse to turn epistemological insight about [[emptiness]] and Buddha-nature into an essentialist metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;Liberman, page 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shurangama Sutra and the Lankavatara Sutra also equate the ''tathagatagarbha'' (and ''[[alaya-vijnana]]'') with nirvana, though this is concerned with the actual attainment of nirvana as opposed to nirvana as a timeless phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, page 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, page 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bodhicitta ==
The Mahayana interprets the brightly shining ''citta'' as ''[[bodhicitta]]'', the altruistic "spirit of awakening."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, page 97.&lt;/ref&gt; The Astasahasrika Perfection of Wisdom Sutra describes ''bodhicitta'' thus: "That citta is no citta since it is by nature brightly shining." This is in accord with Anguttara Nikaya I,10 which goes from a reference to brightly shining ''citta'' to saying that even the slightest development of [[Metta|loving-kindness]] is of great benefit. This implies that loving-kindness - and the related state of compassion - is inherent within the luminous mind as a basis for its further development.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, page 97.&lt;/ref&gt; The observation that the ground state of consciousness is of the nature of loving-kindness implies that empathy is innate to consciousness and exists prior to the emergence of all active mental processes.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, page 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vajrayana==
''Luminosity'' or ''clear light'' ([[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] '''od gsal'', [[Sanskrit]] ''prabhāsvara''), is central concept in [[Vajrayana|Esoteric Buddhism]], [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and [[Bon]]. It is the innate condition of the mind, associated with [[buddha-nature]], the realisation of which is the goal of meditative practice.

The Indian tantric commentator Indrabhuti, in his ''Jñanasiddhi,'' states that &lt;blockquote&gt;Being luminous by nature, this mind is similar to the moon’s disc. The lunar disc epitomises the knowledge (''jñāna'') that is luminous by nature. Just as the waxing moon gradually emerges in its fullness, in the same way the mind-jewel (''cittaratna''), being naturally luminous, also fully emerges in its perfected state. Just as the moon becomes fully visible, once it is freed from the accidental obscurities, in the same way the mind-jewel, being pure by nature (''prakṛti-pariśuddha''), once separated from the stains of defilements (''kleśa''), appears as the perfected buddha-qualities (''guṇa'').&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Luminosity is also a specific term for one of the [[Six Yogas of Naropa]] &lt;ref&gt;Tsongkhapa and Mullin, ''Six Yogas of Naropa,'' Snow Lion, 1996, pages 81-84.&lt;/ref&gt;. In his commentary, [[Pema Karpo]] says that the clear light is experienced briefly by all human beings at the very first moment of death, by advanced yogic practitioners in the highest states of meditation, and unceasingly by all Buddhas.&lt;ref&gt;http://explore.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/show/dead/texts/artofdying&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[Vajrayana]] practices involve the recognition of this aspect of mind in different situations, such as [[dream yoga]]. In this case, the practitioner trains to lucidly enter the deep sleep state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ponlop|first1=Dzogchen|title=Mind beyond death|date=2008|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=1-55939-301-7|pages=86–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one has the ability to remain lucid during deep sleep, one will be able to recognize the luminosity of death and gain [[Buddhahood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ponlop|first1=Dzogchen|title=Mind beyond death|date=2008|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=1-55939-301-7|pages=86–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is called the meeting of mother and child luminosities, resulting in the state of ''thukdam'' at death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rinpoche|first1=Dudjom|title=Counsels from My Heart|date=2001|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston|isbn=1-57062-844-0|pages=59–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dzogchen===
In Tibetan Buddhist [[Dzogchen]] literature, luminosity ('''od gsal'') is associated with an aspect of the [[Ground (Dzogchen)|Ground]] termed "spontaneous presence" (''Lhun grub''), meaning a presence that is uncreated and not based on anything causally extraneous to itself.&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, 52&lt;/ref&gt; This term is often paired with 'original-purity' (''ka dag''), which is associated with emptiness ([[shunyata]]), and are both seen as inseparable aspects of the Ground. Other terms used to describe this aspect are dynamism or creative power (''rtsal'') and radiance (''dwangs'').&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33868">'''Mental chronometry''' is the use of '''response time''' in perceptual-motor tasks to infer the content, duration, and temporal sequencing of cognitive operations. Mental chronometry is one of the core paradigms of  [[experimental psychology|experimental]] and [[cognitive psychology]], and has found application in various disciplines including [[Physiological psychology|cognitive psychophysiology]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], and [[behavioral neuroscience]] to elucidate mechanisms underlying cognitive processing.

Mental chronometry is studied using measurements of '''reaction time''' (RT), which is the elapsed time between the presentation of a sensory stimulus and the subsequent behavioral response. In psychometric psychology it is considered to be an index of processing speed.&lt;ref name=Jensen /&gt; That is, it indicates how fast the individual can execute the mental operations needed by the task at hand. In turn, speed of processing is considered an index of processing efficiency. The behavioral response is typically a button press but can also be an eye movement, a vocal response, or some other observable behavior. RT is constrained not only by the speed of signal transmission in white matter, but also by the properties of synaptic and neural processing in cortical gray matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuang|first1=S.|title=Is reaction time an index of white matter connectivity during training?|journal=Cognitive Neuroscience|date=2017|volume=8|doi=10.1080/17588928.2016.1205575|pages=126–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its utility as a dependent variable for drawing conclusions about information processing is constrained by the experimental design, measurement technology, and mathematical theorizing of the enterprise.&lt;ref name=Luce&gt;{{cite book | last=Luce |first= R.D. |year=1986 |title=Response times: Their role in inferring elementary mental organization | location= New York |publisher= Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-503642-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
''Reaction time'' (''RT'') is the time that elapses between a person being presented with a stimulus and the person initiating a motor response to the stimulus. It is usually on the order of 200 [[Millisecond|ms]]. The processes that occur during this brief time enable the brain to perceive the surrounding environment, identify an object of interest, decide an action in response to the object, and issue a motor command to execute the movement. These processes span the domains of perception and movement, and involve perceptual decision making and [[motor planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wong|first=Aaron L.|last2=Haith|first2=Adrian M.|last3=Krakauer|first3=John W.|date=August 2015|title=Motor Planning|journal=The Neuroscientist: A Review Journal Bringing Neurobiology, Neurology and Psychiatry|volume=21|issue=4|pages=385–398|doi=10.1177/1073858414541484|issn=1089-4098|pmid=24981338}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- quote=The time from stimulus onset to the initiation of a motor response&amp;mdash;the reaction time (RT)&amp;mdash;occurs on the order of 200 ms (e.g., Welford 1980). During this brief time, a series of processes unfold that enable the brain to perceive the surrounding environment, identify a particular object of interest, determine the required action in response to that object, and issue a motor command to implement the desired action. While clearly spanning the domains of perception and movement, it is challenging to define which of these planning processes involve perceptual decision making and which are motor (i.e., “motor planning”). --&gt;

''Response time'' is the sum of ''reaction time'' and ''movement time.'' Usually the focus in research is on reaction time. There are four basic means of measuring it:

*''Simple'' reaction time is the motion required for an observer to respond to the presence of a stimulus. For example, a subject might be asked to press a button as soon as a light or sound appears. Mean RT for college-age individuals is about 160 [[millisecond]]s to detect an auditory stimulus, and approximately 190 milliseconds to detect visual stimulus.&lt;ref name=Kosinski /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taoka |first1=George T. |title=Brake Reaction Times of Unalerted Drivers |journal=ITE Journal |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages= 19–21 |date=March 1989
|url=http://www.ite.org/membersonly/itejournal/pdf/jca89a19.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mean reaction times for sprinters at the Beijing Olympics were 166 ms for males and 189 ms for females, but in one out of 1,000 starts they can achieve 109 ms and 121 ms, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lipps | first1 = D.B. | last2 = Galecki | first2 = A.T. | last3 = Ashton-Miller | first3 = J.A. | year = | title = On the Implications of a Sex Difference in the Reaction Times of Sprinters at the Beijing Olympics | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 10| page = e26141 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0026141 |bibcode = 2011PLoSO...626141L | pmid=22039438 | pmc=3198384}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study also concluded that longer female reaction times can be an artifact of the measurement method used, suggesting that the starting block sensor system might overlook a female false-start due to insufficient pressure on the pads. The authors suggested compensating for this threshold would improve false-start detection accuracy with female runners.
*''Recognition'' or ''go/no-go'' reaction time tasks require that the subject press a button when one stimulus type appears and withhold a response when another stimulus type appears. For example, the subject may have to press the button when a green light appears and not respond when a blue light appears.
*''Choice'' reaction time (CRT) tasks require distinct responses for each possible class of stimulus. For example, the subject might be asked to press one button if a red light appears and a different button if a yellow light appears. The [[Jensen box]] is an example of an instrument designed to measure choice reaction time.
*''Discrimination'' reaction time involves comparing pairs of simultaneously presented visual displays and then pressing one of two buttons according to which display appears brighter, longer, heavier, or greater in magnitude on some dimension of interest.

Due to momentary [[attention]]al lapses, there is a considerable amount of [[statistical dispersion|variability]] in an individual's response time, which does not tend to follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution. To control for this, researchers typically require a subject to perform multiple trials, from which a measure of the 'typical' or baseline response time can be calculated. Taking the mean of the raw response time is rarely an effective method of characterizing the typical response time, and alternative approaches (such as modeling the entire response time distribution) are often more appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1077&amp;context=tpr] Whelan, R. (2008). Effective analysis of reaction time data. The Psychological Record, 58, 475-482.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of methodology==

===Galton and differential psychology===
Sir [[Francis Galton]] is typically credited as the founder of [[differential psychology]], which seeks to determine and explain the mental differences between individuals. He was the first to use rigorous reaction time tests with the express intention of determining averages and ranges of individual differences in mental and behavioral traits in humans. Galton hypothesized that differences in [[intelligence]] would be reflected in variation of sensory discrimination and speed of response to stimuli, and he built various machines to test different measures of this, including reaction time to visual and auditory stimuli. His tests involved a selection of over 10,000 men, women and children from the London public.&lt;ref name=Jensen /&gt;

===Donders' experiment===
The first scientist to measure reaction time in the laboratory was [[Franciscus Donders]] (1869). Donders found that simple reaction time is shorter than recognition reaction time, and that choice reaction time is longer than both.&lt;ref name=Kosinski&gt;[http://biae.clemson.edu/bpc/bp/Lab/110/reaction.htm#Type%20of%20Stimulus Kosinski, R. J. (2008). A literature review on reaction time, Clemson University.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611222125/http://biae.clemson.edu/bpc/bp/Lab/110/reaction.htm |date=2010-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Comparative chart of cognitive methods (after Donders).jpg|400px|thumb|Donders (1868s): method of subtraction. Picture from the 'Historical Introduction to Cognitive Psychology' webpage.]] --&gt;
Donders also devised a subtraction method to analyze the time it took for mental operations to take place.&lt;ref name=Donders /&gt; By subtracting simple reaction time from choice reaction time, for example, it is possible to calculate how much time is needed to make the connection.

This method provides a way to investigate the cognitive processes underlying simple perceptual-motor tasks, and formed the basis of subsequent developments.&lt;ref name=Donders&gt;Donders, F.C. (1869). On the speed of mental processes. In W. G. Koster (Ed.), Attention and Performance II. ''Acta Psychologica'', 30, 412-431. (Original work published in 1868.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Donders' work paved the way for future research in mental chronometry tests, it was not without its drawbacks. His insertion method, often referred to as "pure insertion", was based on the assumption that inserting a particular complicating requirement into an RT paradigm would not affect the other components of the test. This assumption—that the incremental effect on RT was strictly additive—was not able to hold up to later experimental tests, which showed that the insertions were able to interact with other portions of the RT paradigm. Despite this, Donders' theories are still of interest and his ideas are still used in certain areas of psychology, which now have the statistical tools to use them more accurately.&lt;ref name=Jensen&gt;Jensen, A. R. (2006). Clocking the mind: Mental chronometry and individual differences. Amsterdam: Elsevier. ({{ISBN|978-0-08-044939-5}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hick's law===
{{Main|Hick's law}}

[[W. E. Hick]] (1952) devised a CRT experiment which presented a series of nine tests in which there are ''n'' equally possible choices. The experiment measured the subject's reaction time based on number of possible choices during any given trial. Hick showed that the individual's reaction time increased by a constant amount as a function of available choices, or the "uncertainty" involved in which reaction stimulus would appear next. Uncertainty is measured in "bits", which are defined as the quantity of information that reduces uncertainty by half in [[information theory]]. In Hick's experiment, the reaction time is found to be a function of the [[binary logarithm]] of the number of available choices (''n''). This phenomenon is called "Hick's law" and is said to be a measure of the "rate of gain of information". The law is usually expressed by the formula &lt;math&gt;RT = a + b\log_2(n + 1)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are constants representing the intercept and slope of the function, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-Hickslaw.html Hick's Law at Encyclopedia.com] Originally from Colman, A. (2001). ''A Dictionary of Psychology''. Retrieved February 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Jensen Box is a more recent application of Hick's law.&lt;ref name=Jensen /&gt; Hick's law has interesting modern applications in marketing, where restaurant menus and web interfaces (among other things) take advantage of its principles in striving to achieve speed and ease of use for the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;W.

===Sternberg's memory-scanning task===

[[Saul Sternberg]]&lt;!-- full name so as not to confuse him with Robert Sternberg--&gt; (1966) devised an experiment wherein subjects were told to remember a set of unique digits in [[short-term memory]].  Subjects were then given a probe [[stimulation|stimulus]] in the form of a digit from 0-9.  The subject then answered as quickly as possible whether the probe was in the previous set of digits or not.  The size of the initial set of digits determined the reaction time of the subject.  The idea is that as the size of the set of digits increases the number of processes that need to be completed before a decision can be made increases as well.  So if the subject has 4 items in [[short-term memory]] (STM), then after encoding the information from the probe stimulus the subject needs to compare the probe to each of the 4 items in memory and then make a decision.  If there were only 2 items in the initial set of digits, then only 2 processes would be needed.  The data from this study found that for each additional item added to the set of digits, about 38 milliseconds were added to the response time of the subject.  This supported the idea that a subject did a serial exhaustive search through memory rather than a serial self-terminating search.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.153.3736.652 | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = S. | year = 1966 | title = High speed scanning in human memory | url = | journal = Science | volume = 153 | issue = 3736| pages = 652–654 | pmid = 5939936 |bibcode = 1966Sci...153..652S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sternberg (1969) developed a much-improved method for dividing reaction time into successive or serial stages, called the additive factor method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0001-6918(69)90055-9 | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = S. | year = 1969 | title = The discovery of processing stages: Extensions of Donders' method | url = | journal = Acta Psychologica | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 276–315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shepard and Metzler's mental rotation task===
{{Main|Mental rotation}}

[[Roger Shepard|Shepard]] and Metzler (1971) presented a pair of three-dimensional shapes that were identical or mirror-image versions of one another.  Reaction time to determine whether they were identical or not was a linear function of the angular difference between their orientation, whether in the picture plane or in depth. They concluded that the observers performed a constant-rate mental rotation to align the two objects so they could be compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.171.3972.701 | last1 = Shepard | first1 = R.N. | last2 = Metzler | first2 = J. | year = 1971 | title = Mental rotation of three-dimensional objects | url = | journal = Science | volume = 171 | issue = 3972| pages = 701–703 | pmid = 5540314 |bibcode = 1971Sci...171..701S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper and Shepard (1973) presented a letter or digit that was either normal or mirror-reversed, and presented either upright or at angles of rotation in units of 60 degrees. The subject had to identify whether the stimulus  was normal or mirror-reversed. Response time increased roughly linearly as the orientation of the letter deviated from upright (0 degrees) to inverted (180 degrees), and then decreases again until it reaches 360 degrees. The authors concluded that the subjects mentally rotate the image the shortest distance to upright, and then judge whether it is normal or mirror-reversed.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, L. A., &amp; Shepard, R. N. (1973). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780121701505500093 Chronometric studies of the rotation of mental images]. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sentence-picture verification===

Mental chronometry has been used in identifying some of the processes associated with understanding a sentence.  This type of research typically revolves around the differences in processing 4 types of sentences: true affirmative (TA), false affirmative (FA), false negative (FN), and true negative (TN).  A picture can be presented with an associated sentence that falls into one of these 4 categories.  The subject then decides if the sentence matches the picture or does not.  The type of sentence determines how many processes need to be performed before a decision can be made.  According to the data from Clark and Chase (1972) and Just and Carpenter (1971), the TA sentences are the simplest and take the least time, than FA, FN, and TN sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0010-0285(72)90019-9 | last1 = Clark | first1 = H.

===Models of memory===

Hierarchical network models of memory were largely discarded due to some findings related to mental chronometry.  The TLC model proposed by [[Allan M. Collins|Collins]] and Quillian (1969) had a hierarchical structure indicating that recall speed in memory should be based on the number of levels in memory traversed in order to find the necessary information.  But the experimental results did not agree.  For example, a subject will reliably answer that a robin is a bird more quickly than he will answer that an ostrich is a bird despite these questions accessing the same two levels in memory.  This led to the development of spreading activation models of memory (e.g., Collins &amp; Loftus, 1975), wherein links in memory are not organized hierarchically but by importance instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.82.6.407 | last1 = Collins | first1 = A.

===Posner's letter matching studies===

[[Michael Posner (psychologist)|Michael Posner]] (1978) used a series of letter-matching studies to measure the mental processing time of several tasks associated with recognition of a pair of letters.  The simplest task was the physical match task, in which subjects were shown a pair of letters and had to identify whether the two letters were physically identical or not.  The next task was the name match task where subjects had to identify whether two letters had the same name.  The task involving the most cognitive processes was the rule match task in which subjects had to determine whether the two letters presented both were vowels or not vowels.

The physical match task was the most simple; subjects had to encode the letters, compare them to each other, and make a decision.  When doing the name match task subjects were forced to add a cognitive step before making a decision: they had to search memory for the names of the letters, and then compare those before deciding.  In the rule based task they had to also categorize the letters as either vowels or consonants before making their choice.  The time taken to perform the rule match task was longer than the name match task which was longer than the physical match task.  Using the subtraction method experimenters were able to determine the approximate amount of time that it took for subjects to perform each of the cognitive processes associated with each of these tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, M. I. (1978). Chronometric explorations of mind. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cognitive development ==
{{Main|Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development}}

There is extensive recent research using mental chronometry for the study of [[cognitive development]]. Specifically, various measures of [[speed of processing]] were used to examine changes in the speed of information processing as a function of age. Kail (1991) showed that speed of processing increases exponentially from early childhood to early adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.109.3.490 | last1 = Kail | first1 = R. | year = 1991 | title = Developmental functions for speed of processing during childhood and adolescence | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 109 | issue = 3| pages = 490–501 | pmid = 2062981 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of reaction times in young children of various ages are consistent with common observations of children engaged in activities not typically associated with chronometry.&lt;ref name=Jensen /&gt; This includes speed of counting, reaching for things, repeating words, and other developing vocal and motor skills that develop quickly in growing children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Case, Robbie |title=Intellectual development: birth to adulthood |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=1985 |pages= |isbn=0-12-162880-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once reaching early maturity, there is then a long period of stability until speed of processing begins declining from middle age to senility (Salthouse, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0301-0511(00)00052-1 | last1 = Salthouse | first1 = T.

[[Demetriou]] and colleagues, using various methods of measuring speed of processing, showed that it is closely associated with changes in working memory and thought (Demetriou, Mouyi, &amp; Spanoudis, 2009). These relations are extensively discussed in the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]].&lt;ref name=Demetriou&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Demetriou | first1 = A. | last2 = Mouyi | first2 = A. | last3 = Spanoudis | first3 = G. | year = 2008 | title = Modeling the structure and development of g | url = | journal = Intelligence | volume = 36 | issue = 5| pages = 437–454 |doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2007.10.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During senescence, RT deteriorates (as does [[fluid intelligence]]), and this deterioration is systematically associated with changes in many other cognitive processes, such as executive functions, working memory, and inferential processes.&lt;ref name=Demetriou /&gt; In the theory of [[Andreas Demetriou]],&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou, A., Mouyi, A., &amp; Spanoudis, G.

Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; one of [[the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]], change in speed of processing with age, as indicated by decreasing reaction time, is one of the pivotal factors of cognitive development.

== Cognitive ability ==

Researchers have reported medium-sized [[correlation]]s between reaction time and measures of [[intelligence]]: There is thus a tendency for individuals with higher IQ to be faster on reaction time tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheppard|first=Leah D.|last2=Vernon|first2=Philip A.|date=February 2008|title=Intelligence and speed of information-processing: A review of 50 years of research|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2007.09.015|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=44|issue=3|pages=535–551|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2007.09.015|issn=0191-8869|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research into this link between mental speed and [[general intelligence factor|general intelligence]] (perhaps first proposed by [[Charles Spearman]]) was re-popularised by [[Arthur Jensen]], and the "[[Jensen Box|Choice reaction Apparatus]]" associated with his name became a common standard tool in reaction time-IQ research.

The strength of the RT-IQ association is a subject of research. Several studies have reported association between simple reaction time and intelligence of around (''r''=−.31), with a tendency for  larger associations between choice reaction time and intelligence (''r''=−.49).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0160-2896(01)00062-9 | last1 = Deary | first1 = I.

This promised to link intelligence directly to the resolution of information even in very basic information tasks. There is some support for a link between the slope of the reaction time curve and intelligence, as long as reaction time is tightly controlled.&lt;ref name="bates"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0160-2896(99)80052-X | last1 = Bates | first1 = T.

Standard deviations of reaction times have been found to be more strongly correlated with measures of general intelligence (''g'') than mean reaction times. The reaction times of low-''g'' individuals are more spread-out than those of high-''g'' individuals.&lt;ref name="ravenzwaaij"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi =  10.1016/j.cognition.2011.02.002| last1 = van Ravenzwaaij | first1 = Don  | last2 = Brown  | first2 = Scott | first3= Eric-Jan|last3 =Wagenmakers  |year = 2011 | title = An integrated perspective on the relation between response speed and intelligence| url =http://www.donvanravenzwaaij.com/Papers_files/van%20Ravenzwaaij,%20Brown,%20%26%20Wagenmakers,%202011.pdf | journal = Cognition  | volume = 119 | issue = 3| pages = 381–93 | pmid =  21420077 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of the relationship is unclear. It may reflect more efficient information processing, better attentional control, or the integrity of neuronal processes.

With the advent of the functional neuroimaging techniques of [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[fMRI]], psychologists started to modify their mental chronometry paradigms for functional imaging (Posner, 2005). Although psycho([[physiological psychology|physio]])logists have been using [[electroencephalography|electroencephalographic]] measurements for decades, the images obtained with PET have attracted great interest from other branches of neuroscience, popularizing mental chronometry among a wider range of scientists in recent years. The way that mental chronometry is utilized is by performing reaction time based tasks which show through neuroimaging the parts of the brain which are involved in the cognitive process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Posner | first1 = Michael I. | title = Timing the Brain: Mental Chronometry as a Tool in Neuroscience | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = e51 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15719059 | pmc = 548951 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030051 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
With the invention of [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), techniques were used to measure activity through electrical event-related potentials in a study when subjects were asked to identify if a digit that was presented was above or below five. According to Sternberg’s additive theory, each of the stages involved in performing this task includes: encoding, comparing against the stored representation for five, selecting a response, and then checking for error in the response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/14640747508400459 | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = S. | year = 1975 | title = Memory scanning: New findings and current controversies | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 1–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fMRI image presents the specific locations where these stages are occurring in the brain while performing this simple mental chronometry task.

In the 1980s, neuroimaging experiments allowed researchers to detect the activity in localized brain areas by injecting [[radionuclides]] and using [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) to detect them. Also, fMRI was used which have detected the precise brain areas that are active during mental chronometry tasks. Many studies have shown that there is a small number of brain areas which are widely spread out which are involved in performing these cognitive tasks.

Current medical reviews indicate that [[signal transduction|signaling]] through the [[dopamine pathway]]s originating in the [[ventral tegmental area]] is strongly positively correlated with improved (shortened) reaction time;&lt;ref name="Amph-DA reaction time"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parker KL, Lamichhane D, Caetano MS, Narayanan NS | title = Executive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease and timing deficits | journal = Front.

For instance, amphetamine, which increases concentrations of dopamine at the synaptic cleft (Maricq and Church, 1983; Zetterström et al., 1983) advances the start of responding during interval timing (Taylor et al., 2007), whereas antagonists of D2 type dopamine receptors typically slow timing (Drew et al., 2003; Lake and Meck, 2013).&amp;nbsp;...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9628">The '''signature''' {{nowrap|(''v'', ''p'', ''r'')}} of a [[metric tensor]] ''g'' (or equivalently, a real [[quadratic form]] thought of as a real [[symmetric bilinear form]] on a finite-dimensional vector space) is the number (counted with multiplicity) of positive, zero, and negative [[eigenvalue]]s of the real [[symmetric matrix]] {{nowrap|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt;}}  of the metric tensor with respect to a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. In physics, the ''v'' represents for the time or virtual dimension, and the ''p'' for the space and physical dimension. Alternatively, it can be defined as the dimensions of a maximal positive and null subspace. By [[Sylvester's law of inertia]] these numbers do not depend on the choice of basis. The signature thus classifies the metric up to a choice of basis. The signature is often denoted by a pair of integers {{nowrap|(''v'', ''p'')}} implying ''r'' = 0 or as an explicit list of signs of eigenvalues such as {{nowrap|(+, −, −, −)}} or {{nowrap|(−, +, +, +)}} for the signature {{nowrap|(1, 3, 0)}}, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Rowland, Todd. "Matrix Signature." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource, created by Eric W. Weisstein. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MatrixSignature.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The signature is said to be '''indefinite''' or '''mixed''' if both ''v'' and ''p'' are nonzero, and degenerate if ''r'' is nonzero. A [[Riemannian metric]] is a metric with a [[definite bilinear form|positive definite]] signature {{nowrap|(''v'', p)}}. The [[Lorentz metric|Lorentzian metric]] is a metric signature {{nowrap|(''v'', ''p'')}} with two eigenvalues.

There is another notion of '''signature''' of a nondegenerate metric tensor given by a single number ''s'' defined as {{nowrap|(''v''−''p'')}}, where ''v'' and ''p'' are as above, which is equivalent to the above definition when the dimension ''n'' = ''v'' + ''p'' is given or implicit.  For example, ''s'' = 1 − 3 = −2 for {{nowrap|(+, −, −, −)}} and its mirroring ''s' '' = −''s'' = +2 for {{nowrap|(−, +, +, +)}}.

== Definition ==
The signature of a metric tensor is defined as the signature of the corresponding [[quadratic form]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Landau|first1=L.D.|authorlink1=Lev Landau|last2=Lifshitz|first2=E.M.|authorlink2=Evgeny Lifshitz|title=The Classical Theory of Fields|series=Course of Theoretical Physics|volume=2|edition=4th|publisher=[[Butterworth&amp;ndash;Heinemann]]|isbn=0 7506 2768 9|year=2002|orig-year=1939|pages=245&amp;ndash;246}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the number {{nowrap|(''v'', ''p'', ''r'')}} of positive and zero [[eigenvalues]] of any matrix (i.e. in any basis for the underlying vector space) representing the form, counted with their [[algebraic multiplicity]]. Usually, {{nowrap|''r'' {{=}} 0}} is required, which is the same as saying a metric tensor must be nondegenerate, i.e. no nonzero vector is orthogonal to all vectors.

By Sylvester's law of inertia, the numbers {{nowrap|(''v'', ''p'', ''r'')}} are basis independent.

== Properties ==

=== Signature and dimension ===
By the [[spectral theorem]] a symmetric ''n'' × ''n'' matrix over the reals is always [[diagonalizable]], and has therefore exactly ''n'' real eigenvalues (counted with [[algebraic multiplicity]]). Thus {{nowrap|1=''v'' + ''p'' = ''n'' = dim(''V'')}}.

=== Sylvester's law of inertia: independence of basis choice and existence of orthonormal basis ===
According to [[Sylvester's law of inertia]], the signature of the scalar product  (a.k.a. real symmetric bilinear form), ''g'' does not depend on the choice of basis. Moreover, for every metric ''g'' of signature {{nowrap|(''v'', ''p'', ''r'')}} there exists a basis such that 
{{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt; = +1}} for {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b'' = 1, ..., ''v''}}, {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt; = −1}} for {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b'' = ''v'' + 1, ..., ''v'' + ''p''}} and {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}} otherwise. It follows that there exists an [[isometry]] {{nowrap|(''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) → (''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} if and only if the signatures of ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are equal.  Likewise the signature is equal for two [[congruent matrices]] and classifies a matrix up to congruency. Equivalently, the signature is constant on the orbits of the general linear group GL(''V'') on the space of symmetric rank 2 contravariant tensors ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; and classifies each orbit.

===Geometrical interpretation of the indices ===
The number ''v'' (resp.  ''p'') is the maximal dimension of a vector subspace on which the scalar product ''g'' is positive-definite (resp. negative-definite), and ''r'' is the dimension of the [[Symmetric bilinear form#Orthogonality and singularity|radical]] of the scalar product ''g'' or the [[null space|null subspace]] of [[symmetric matrix]] {{nowrap|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the [[scalar product]]. Thus a nondegenerate scalar product has signature {{nowrap|(''v'', ''p'', 0)}}, with {{nowrap|1=''v'' + ''p'' = ''n''}}. A duality of the special cases {{nowrap|(''v'', ''p'', 0)}} correspond to two scalar eigenvalues which can be transformed into each other by the mirroring reciprocally.

== Examples ==

=== Matrices ===
The signature of the {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} [[identity matrix]] is {{nowrap|(''v'', ''p'', 0)}} where {{nowrap|1=''n'' = ''v'' + ''p''}}. The [[diagonal matrix]] of a signature is the number of positive, negative and zero numbers on its [[main diagonal]].

The following matrices have both the same signature {{nowrap|(1, 1, 0)}}, therefore they are congruent because of [[Sylvester's law of inertia]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0  \\ 0 &amp; -1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1  \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Scalar products ===
The standard [[scalar product]] defined on &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^n &lt;/math&gt; has the n-dimensional signatures {{nowrap|(''v'', ''p'', ''r'')}}, where {{nowrap|1=''v'' + ''p'' = ''n''}} and rank {{nowrap|1=''r ''=''0''}}.

In physics, the [[Minkowski space]] is a spacetime manifold &lt;math&gt;\R^4&lt;/math&gt; with ''v=1'' and ''p=3'' bases, and has a scalar product defined by either the &lt;math&gt;\check g&lt;/math&gt; matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;\check g=\begin{pmatrix} -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
which has signature &lt;math&gt;(1, 3, 0)^-&lt;/math&gt; and known as space-supremacy or space-like; Or the mirroring signature &lt;math&gt;(1,3, 0)^+&lt;/math&gt;, known virtual-supremacy or time-like with the &lt;math&gt;\hat g&lt;/math&gt; matrix. 
:&lt;math&gt;\hat g=\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \end{pmatrix}=-\check g&lt;/math&gt;

== How to compute the signature ==
There are some methods for computing the signature of a matrix.
* For any [[nondegenerate]] [[symmetric matrix]] of {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}}, [[Matrix diagonalization|diagonalize]] it (or find all of [[eigenvalue]]s of it) and count the number of positive and negative signs.
* For a symmetric matrix, the characteristic polynomial will have all real roots whose signs may in some cases be completely determined by [[Descartes' rule of signs]].
* Lagrange algorithm gives a way to compute an [[orthogonal basis]], and thus compute a diagonal matrix congruent (thus, with the same signature) to the other one: the signature of a diagonal matrix is the number of positive, negative and zero elements on its diagonal.
* According to Jacobi's criterion, a symmetric matrix is positive-definite if and only if all the determinants of its main minors are positive.

== Signature in physics ==
In mathematics, the usual convention for any [[Riemannian manifold]] is to use a positive-definite [[metric tensor]] (meaning that after diagonalization, elements on the diagonal are all positive).

In [[theoretical physics]], [[spacetime]] is modeled by a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]].  The signature counts how many time-like or space-like characters are in the spacetime, in the sense defined by [[special relativity]]: as used in [[particle physics]], the metric has an eigenvalue on the time-like subspace, and its mirroring eigenvalue on the space-like subspace.
In the specific case of the [[Minkowski space|Minkowski metric]],
: &lt;math&gt; ds^2 = c^2 dt^2 - dx^2 - dy^2 - dz^2 &lt;/math&gt; ,
the metric signature is &lt;math&gt;(1, 3, 0)^+&lt;/math&gt; or (+, −, −, −) if its eigenvalue is defined in the time direction, or &lt;math&gt;(1, 3, 0)^-&lt;/math&gt; or (−, +, +, +) if the eigenvalue is defined in the three spatial directions ''x'', ''y'' and ''z''. 
(Sometimes the opposite [[Sign (mathematics)|sign]] convention is used, but with the one given here ''s'' directly measures [[proper time]].)

==Signature change==
If a metric is regular everywhere then the signature of the metric is constant. However if one allows for metrics that are degenerate or discontinuous on some hypersurfaces, then signature of the metric may change at these surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The '''Occupational Personality Questionnaires''', '''OPQ''' or '''OPQ32''', are widely used occupational [[Personality test|personality questionnaires]]. The authors were [[Peter Saville (psychologist)|Saville]] et al., including Roger Holdsworth, Gill Nyfield, Lisa Cramp and Bill Mabey, and they were launched by Saville and Holdsworth Ltd. in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;BPS Review, 1994 and 2007, Occupational Personality Questionnaires, Concept Model, authors P. Saville, R. Holdsworth, G. Nyfield, L. Cramp and W. Mabey&lt;/ref&gt; The series included the first commercially available [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] instrument.

OPQ32 provides an indication of an individual's preferred behavioural style at work; to help employers gauge how a candidate will fit into certain work environments, how they will work with other people and how they will cope with different job requirements. It is now available in more than 30 languages and uses [[item response theory]] to shorten the questionnaire down to under 30 minutes.

The OPQ32 is used in selection, development, [[team building]], [[succession planning]] and organisational change. Independent reviews are available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychtesting.org.uk/test-registration-and-test-reviews/test-reviews.cfm?page=summary&amp;Test_ID=185 Psychtesting.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashridge.org.uk/Website/Content.nsf/wELNPSY/Psychometric+Instruments+-+Occupational+Personality+Questionnaire+(OPQ)?opendocument Ashbridge.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Distribution is done today by SHL Group Limited.

Manmingongdongheo was first held on 1896. On March 10, 1897, criticizing an intervention of Russia. Ten thousand Seoul citizens attended the congress. Within ten days, the Korean Empire government agreed the decisions of Manmingongdonghoe and Russia conceded to Korean order. The congress grew more and more, and insisted on various rights of people and protection of concessions from the great Powers.

On October 12, the congress succeed in founding a reform-minded government composed of innovative officials such as [[Mihn Yong-hwan]] and [[Park Jeong-yang]]. The new government agreed to establish a [[national assembly]]. However pro-Russians and conservatives who hated Manmingongdonghoe, spread a rumor that the congress will revolt and expel [[Emperor Gojong]].&lt;ref name="bisops"&gt;[http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=237092&amp;v=43 People's joint association] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130411110936/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=237092&amp;v=43 |date=2013-04-11 }} {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gojong surprised and ordered the troops to dissolve the congress.&lt;ref name="bisops"/&gt;

'''Proof-of-authority''' ('''PoA''') is an [[algorithm]] used with [[blockchain]]s that delivers comparatively fast transactions through a consensus mechanism based on identity as a stake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-blockchain-needs-proof-of-authority-instead-of-proof-of-stake|title=Why Blockchain Needs ‘Proof of Authority’ Instead of ‘Proof of Stake’|work=Cointelegraph|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proof-of-authority==
In PoA-based networks, transactions and blocks are validated by approved accounts, known as validators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=parity: Fast, light, robust Ethereum implementation|date=2017-12-12|url=https://github.com/paritytech/parity|publisher=Parity Technologies|accessdate=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Validators run software allowing them to put transactions in blocks. The process is automated and does not require validators to be constantly monitoring their computers. It, however, does require maintaining the computer (the authority [[node (networking)|node]]&lt;ref name="enuma-io"/&gt;) uncompromised. The term was coined by [[Gavin Wood]], co-founder of [[Ethereum]] and Parity Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/ethereum/guide/blob/master/poa.md|title=PoA Private Chains|last=Gavin|first=Wood|date=November 2015|website=Github|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With PoA, individuals earn the right to become validators, so there is an incentive to retain the position that they have gained. By attaching a reputation to identity, validators are incentivized to uphold the transaction process, as they do not wish to have their identities attached to a negative reputation. This is considered more robust than PoS ([[proof-of-stake]]), as:
* In PoS, while a stake between two parties may be even, it does not take into account each party’s total holdings. This means that incentives can be unbalanced. 
* Meanwhile, PoW uses an enormous amount of computing power, which, in itself lowers incentive. It is also vulnerable to attack, as a potential attacker would only need to have 51% of the mining resources (hashrate) to control a network, although this is not easy to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.coinfox.info/news/reviews/6417-proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-merits-and-disadvantages|title=Proof-of-Work vs Proof-of-Stake: merits and disadvantages|last=superadmin|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On the other hand, PoA only allows non-consecutive block approval from any one validator, meaning that the risk of serious damage is centralized to the authority node.

PoA is suited for both private networks and public networks, like POA Network, where trust is distributed.&lt;ref name="enuma-io"/&gt;

== Comparisons ==
{{main|Proof-of-work|Proof-of-stake}}
* The [[proof-of-work]] (PoW) consensus uses a [[cryptocurrency mining|mining]] mechanism, where PoA does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blockgeeks.com/guides/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake/|title=Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake: Basic Mining Guide|date=2017-03-15|work=Blockgeeks|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[proof-of-stake]] (PoS) mechanism works using an algorithm that selects participants with the highest stakes as validators, assuming that the highest stakeholders are incentivized to ensure a transaction is processed. PoW works by verifying that work (mining) has been done before transactions are carried out.&lt;ref name="enuma-io"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.enuma.io/update/2017/08/29/proof-of-authority-ethereum-networks.html|title=Rolling your own Proof-of-Authority Ethereum consortium|website=blog.enuma.io|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Meanwhile, PoA uses identity as the sole verification of the authority to validate, meaning that there is no need to use mining.
* [[Delegated proof-of-stake]] (DPoS) works using witnesses, who generate blocks. Witnesses are elected by stakeholders at a rate of one vote per share per witness. However, with PoA, the appointment of an authority is automatic, meaning that there can be no bias or uneven process caused by unequal stakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bitshares.org/technology/delegated-proof-of-stake-consensus/|title=Delegated Proof-of-Stake Consensus - BitShares|website=bitshares.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In PoA, validators need to have their identity verified formally via DApps, and have this identity information available in the public domain for everyone to cross-reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/oracles-network/proof-of-authority-consensus-model-with-identity-at-stake-d5bd15463256|title=Proof of Authority: consensus model with Identity at Stake.|last=Network|first=Oracles|date=2017-11-11|website=Medium|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Since PoA security is centralized in the form of the authority node, a lot of PoA critics wonder the point of using a blockchain for this kind of usages - stating that PoA blockchains are not really decentralized and a simple DB would be more efficient, faster, and cost effective.

'''Protracted social conflict''' is a [[technical term]] in a [[theory]] developed by [[Edward Azar]]. It generally refers to conflicts described by other researchers as ''protracted'' or ''intractable'', i.e. as complex, severe, commonly enduring, and often violent.

When a group's identity is threatened or frustrated, intractable conflict is almost inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher 2001: 307. (Fisher, Ronald J. (2001) Cyprus: The Failure of Mediation and the Escalation of an Identity-Based Conflict to an Adversarial Impasse. ''Journal of Peace Research'' 38(3), 307–26.)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Protracted social conflict'' as Edward Azar termed it, denotes hostile interactions between communal groups that are based in deep-seated racial, ethnic, religious and cultural hatreds, and that persist over long periods of time with sporadic outbreaks of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher 2001: 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of protracted social conflict==
Protracted social conflict is a theory developed by Edward Azar. The term refers to conflict situations characterized by the prolonged and often violent struggle by communal groups for such basic needs as security, recognition, acceptance, fair access to political institutions, and economic participation.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsbotham, Oliver. Contemporary Conflict Resolution, 2008: 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The communal groups may experience deep-seated cleavages based upon racial, religious, cultural or ethnic lines. These cleavages are characterized by continuing hostility with sporadic outbreaks of violence; and caused by the frustration of human needs for security, recognition, and distributive justice.

Such identity-driven rifts are the result of an underlying fear of extinction that often grows within vulnerable ethnic groups who live with the memories or fear of persecution and massacre.&lt;ref&gt;Haddad 2002: 317&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic divisions and perceived threats often result in the domination of the state machinery by a single group or coalition of elites who deny access to basic human needs for the majority of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsbotham, Oliver. Contemporary Conflict Resolution, 2008: 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preconditions to violent conflict==
Azar argued that the denial of basic human needs to a large portion of the population initiated instances of protracted social violence. Four preconditions are isolated by Azar as the predominant sources of protracted social conflict: communal content, deprivation of human needs, governance and the State's role, and international linkages.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsbotham, Oliver. Contemporary Conflict Resolution, 2008: 85–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communal content===
This element, which contributes to the initial creation of protracted social conflict, consists of the fact that people involved in protracted social conflicts create their own identity groups. Azar notes, "that it is the relationship between identity groups and the states, which is at the core of the problem." He also cited the "disarticulation between the state and society as a whole" as a source of violence within a society.&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham85"&gt;Ramsbotham, Oliver. Contemporary Conflict Resolution, 2008: 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

This precondition also involves the reliance that many people have on their social groups; because governments in areas that experience protracted social conflict are often unable, incapable or unwilling to provide basic human necessities to the population, individuals turn to their social groups for stability. The resultant disconnection of society and the state can be linked to the colonial legacy, which, "artificially imposed European ideas of territorial statehood onto a multitude of communal groups."&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham86"&gt;Ramsbotham, Oliver. Contemporary Conflict Resolution, 2008: 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

This results in the domination of certain identity groups over others. The dominant group isolates itself from the needs of other groups, leading to an even bigger separation between groups even within an ethnicity. To overcome this division of society, national identity must be stressed over individual group identity.

===Deprivation of human needs===
To alleviate the "underdevelopments" Azar holds responsible for protracted social violence, and in turn overcome the conflict resulting from underdevelopment, Azar points to the needs of security, development, political access and identity in terms of cultural and religious expression.&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham86"/&gt; Azar refers to these needs as non-negotiable; therefore, if these needs are not met, people will inevitably want a structural change to take place. Such a need for structural change is likely to result in a violent conflict.&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham85"/&gt;

This in turn emphasizes Azar's theory that the "deprivation of human needs is the underlying source of protracted social conflict" where conflict is emphasized by the collective grievances of a group of people.&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham86"/&gt; To overcome this deprivation of human needs to entire groups of people, the government must offer security on a multiplicity of levels to all of the constituent population.

===Governance and the State's role===
With government being "endowed with the authority to govern and use force where necessary to regulate society, to protect citizens, and to provide collective goods,"&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham86"/&gt; the government plays a leading role in the satisfaction or lack of satisfaction of minority and identity groups.

Azar states that protracted social conflicts can be characterized by "incompetent, parochial, fragile, and authoritarian governments that fail to satisfy basic human needs."&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham87"&gt;Ramsbotham, Oliver. Contemporary Conflict Resolution, 2008: 87.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that governments, expected to be unbiased and impartial, tend to be dominated by the leading identity groups or those groups that have been able to monopolize power within a country or [[territorial entity]]. This creates a "crisis of legitimacy"&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham87"/&gt; in the governance of these countries. The structure of the government needs to be changed so that all citizens are equally cared for and equally represented without bias or corruption.

===International linkages===
This involves the "political–economic relations of economic dependency within the international economic system, and the network of political-military linkages constituting regional and global patterns of clientage and cross-border interest."&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham87"/&gt;

Weaker states, like those often involved in protracted social conflict, tend to be more influenced by outside connections both economically and politically. For example, many states are dependent on an external supply of armament. To overcome the dominance of the international economy, the country in question must work to build institutions that can ease global dependency and stimulate domestic economic growth.

==Resolving protracted social conflict==
As Edward Azar stated:
{{quote|"Reducing overt conflict requires reduction in levels of underdevelopment. Groups that seek to satisfy their identity and security needs through conflict are in effect seeking change in the structure of their society. Conflict resolution can truly occur and last if satisfactory amelioration of underdevelopment occurs as well. Studying protracted conflict leads one to conclude that peace is development in the broadest sense of the term."&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham86"/&gt;}}

Conflict resolution approaches that focus on resources, or the interests of parties, may be appropriate means of conflict resolution in conflicts where the only issues are those of resource and interests; however, in protracted social conflicts the main issue is identity-based. Therefore, to be effective, a conflict resolution framework must specifically emphasize the needs and identities of the conflicting parties.

==ARIA model==
Rothman developed a unique approach of conflict resolution that is specifically designed to mitigate protracted social conflict. He terms this approach the ARIA model. In contrast to the model of interactive conflict resolution (ICR) that Fisher proposed in 1996, which includes identity as one of many human needs, the ARIA model "keeps its focus more narrowly attuned to identity issues in particular."&lt;ref name="Rothman97"&gt;Rothman, Jay, RESOLVING IDENTITY BASED CONFLICT IN NATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMUNITIES (Jossey Bass, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothman01"&gt;Rothman, Jay and Marie L. Olson, "From Interest to Identities: Towards a New Emphasis in Interactive Conflict Resolution." ''Journal of Peace Research,'' 2001; 38: p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; Rothman and Olson suggest that conflict can only be truly resolved when identity issues have been sufficiently addressed.

The ARIA model is a comprehensive, yet specific approach to resolving protracted social conflict. It attempts to break down "the barrier of identity through a four-phased process."&lt;ref name="Rothman97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothman01"/&gt; The various stages of the ARIA model are outlined below:

===Antagonism (adversarial framing)===
This first step focuses on the tangible "what of the conflict." It is defined in "us" versus "them" terms and calls on the various entities to elaborate and make clear their underlying values and needs. By bringing animosities to the forefront, it is hoped that the mutual benefits of ending the conflict can be realized.&lt;ref name="Rothman97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothman01"/&gt;

===Resonance (reflexive–reframing)===
After parties have articulated their animosities, the next stage is termed the reflexive–reframing stage where the "why" and "who" of the issue is examined. The identity needs of all sides are brought to the forefront with the goal of getting "the disputants to move from positional bargaining to interest-based approaches."&lt;ref name="Rothman97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothman01"/&gt; Rothman and Olson suggest that the parties should now engage in a "deep dialogue" to give a voice and structure to the underlying needs of the various parties. The needs of the various parties are, in turn, the underlying causes of the conflict. The effect of this stage is termed resonance, as each side has articulated their core concerns and heard the concerns of the other actors. At this point, actors begin to see where their identities converge, and where they diverge.&lt;ref name="Rothman97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothman01"/&gt;

===Invention===
The third stage is termed "inventing" and focuses on the "how" of "cooperatively resolving the conflict and its core through integrative solutions." This stage suggests a mutual attempt by all actors involved to create a mean of ending the conflict.&lt;ref name="Rothman97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothman01"/&gt; It is suggested by Rothman and Olson that since both parties have now come to recognize the other's identity through the two previous stages, "they can concretely explore collaboratively how the tangible issues ... of the conflict can be resolved without threatening the identity of the other."&lt;ref name="Rothman97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothman01"/&gt; The invention of possible means of solutions leads directly to the fourth stage.

===Action===
The fourth and final stage of the ARIA model addresses the "why" and "who" of the conflict, as well as the "how" of cooperation through the tangible "what" of solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, Jay and Marie L. Olson, "From Interest to Identities: Towards a New Emphasis in Interactive Conflict Resolution." ''Journal of Peace Research,'' 2001; 38: p. 289e&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the conflict resolution process based on identity is completed by the concrete outlining of future actions. This stage leads to the tangible resolution of the conflict.

[[File:Sri Lanka Native Tamil.svg|thumb|Percentage of Sri Lankan Tamils per district based on 2001 or 1981 (italic) census|200px|right|Percentage of Sri Lankan Tamils per district based on 2001 or 1981 (italic) census]]
The Sri Lankan conflict exists primarily between the two majority ethnic groups, the [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]], who are mostly [[Buddhist]] and represent around 74% of the population, and the [[Tamil people|Tamil]], who are mostly [[Hindu]], representing around 18%. The majority of Tamils live in northern and eastern provinces and claim them as their traditional homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Malhotra, Deepak and Sumanasiri Liyanage (2005) Long-Term Effects of Peace Workshops in Protracted Conflicts. ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'' 49(6), 908–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its independence in 1948 there has been a conflict between Sinhalese, which gained control over the Sri Lankan government, and different Tamil separatist movements. Among the Sinhalese, the anti-Tamil chauvinism started to spread and the Tamils were more and more disadvantaged and excluded. The incidents escalated into a war in July 1983, after the island-wide pogrom against Tamils.

Tamil secessionists saw the establishment of their own separate state as the only way for securing their people. The war, that has continued since then, has almost completely disrupted civil administration in the northern province and caused economic devastation of the whole country.&lt;ref name="insightonconflict.org"&gt;http://www.insightonconflict.org/sri-lanka/?gclid=CO37iZOb65YCFQI_MAodpmC5PA{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of this ethno-political violence around 65,000 people have been killed, hundreds of thousands injured, and millions displaced.

Among various Tamil separatist groups that have emerged, the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) have risen as the dominant fighting force in [[Sri Lanka]]. Their tactics, proscribed as terrorist by many countries, are ruthless, brutal and highly efficient in eliminating their opposition. They run a parallel government in many areas of the north and east of Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="insightonconflict.org"/&gt;

Since the start of war there were some attempts to reach a ceasefire. In 2002 the Ceasefire agreement was signed, and the government agreed to disarm all paramilitary groups in the north and east. But hostilities continued and even intensified.

Government security forces conquered the LTTE on May 19, 2009 ending the conflict.

==Protracted social conflict in Cyprus==
[[File:Cyprus districts named.png|thumb|200px|right|The division of Cyprus]]
Before the independence of [[Cyprus]], the island's [[Greek Cypriots|Greek]] and [[Turkish Cypriots|Turkish]] communities coexisted relatively peacefully. The major conflict began with the independence in 1960, when Greek community wanted a union (''[[enosis]]'') with Greece, to which the Turkish community opposed. The 1960 constitution brought a complex system of [[Consociationalism|power-sharing]], but both groups wanted to gain more advantages.

When Greek Cypriots wanted to reduce autonomy and representation of Turkish Cypriots, the latter opposed it and intercommunal violence broke out. That led the two communities to embark on a hostile and protracted process of separation and segregation.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Ronald J. (2001) Cyprus: The Failure of Mediation and the Escalation of an Identity-Based Conflict to an Adversarial Impasse. ''Journal of Peace Research'' 38(3), 307–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[1974 Cypriot coup d'état|military coup]] in 1974 the situation erupted into a major crisis. Turkish [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|military intervention]] followed and Turkish forces occupied around 38% of the northern part of the island. This invasion caused an exodus of about 160,000 Greek Cypriots to the south. Later voluntary regrouping of population resulted in another 10,000 Greek Cypriots leaving the northern part, and 40,000 Turkish Cypriots moving to the north, which created two homogeneous ethnic zones on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher 2001: 311&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 the northern part declared Turkish Federated State of Cyprus, which declared independence in 1983 as the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]], recognized only by [[Turkey]]. In 1990s the southern [[Republic of Cyprus]] applied for a membership in the [[European Union]], and the Turkish Cypriots on the other side turned to Turkey.

Although the Cyprus conflict now lasts for a long time, its resolution does not seem to be close. Numerous peace proposals and plans have been made, but more or less unsuccessful. The pre-1974 proposals of different federal or centralist arrangements failed as one or the other side rejected them. The division in 1974 changed the demographics of Cyprus dramatically, putting it in a position where [[Federalism|federalist]] model would be the most appropriate. But again, because of opposing interests all the proposals failed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47807">'''Psychological trauma''' is a type of damage to the [[mind]] that occurs as a result of a distressing event. Trauma is often the result of an overwhelming amount of [[stress (psychological)|stress]] that exceeds one's ability to cope, or integrate the [[emotion]]s involved with that experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samhsa.gov/traumajustice/traumadefinition/definition.aspx|title=Trauma Definition|work=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805161505/http://www.samhsa.gov/traumajustice/traumadefinition/definition.aspx|archivedate=August 5, 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trauma may result from a single distressing experience or recurring events of being overwhelmed that can be precipitated in weeks, years, or even decades as the person struggles to cope with the immediate circumstances, eventually leading to serious, long-term negative consequences.

Because trauma differs between individuals, according to their subjective experiences, people will react to similar traumatic events differently. In other words, not all people who experience a potentially traumatic event will actually become psychologically traumatized. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Storr CL, Ialongo NS, Anthony JC, Breslau N|year=2007|title=Childhood antecedents of exposure to traumatic events and post-traumatic stress disorder|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=164|issue=1|pages=119–25|pmid=17202553|doi=10.1176/ajp.2007.164.1.119}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible for some people to develop [[posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] ([[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]]) after being exposed to a major traumatic event.&lt;ref name=":01"&gt;"Among individuals who do develop post-traumatic stress after exposure to a traumatic event, some develop symptoms sufficient to meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD"

This discrepancy in risk rate can be attributed to [[protective factor]]s some individuals may have that enable them to cope with trauma; they are related to temperamental and environmental factors from among others. Some examples are mild exposure to stress early in life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fenoglio KA, Chen Y, Baram TZ|year=2006|title= Neuroplasticity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis early in life requires recurrent recruitment of stress-regulation brain regions|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|volume=26|issue=9|pages=2434–2442|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4080-05.2006|pmid=16510721|pmc=2408688}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[psychological resilience|resilience]] characteristics, and active seeking of help.&lt;ref name="Wingo, Aliza P. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wingo, Aliza P, Ressler KJ, Bradley B|year=2014|title=Resilience characteristics mitigate tendency for harmful alcohol and illicit drug use in adults with a history of childhood abuse: A cross-sectional study of 2024 inner-city men and women|journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research|volume=51|pages=93–99|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2014.01.007|pmid=24485848|pmc=4605671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR)]] defines trauma as direct personal experience of an event that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury; threat to one's physical integrity, witnessing an event that involves the above experience, learning about unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat of death, or injury experienced by a family member or close associate. Memories associated with trauma are implicit, pre-verbal and cannot be recalled, but can be triggered by stimuli from the [[in vivo]] environment. The person's response to aversive details of traumatic event involve intense fear, helplessness or horror. In children it is manifested as disorganized or agitative behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dsm.psychiatryonline.org/doi/book/10.1176/appi.books.9780890420249.dsm-iv-tr|title=DSM-IV-TR – DSM Library|publisher=|doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890420249.dsm-iv-tr|doi-broken-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trauma can be caused by a wide variety of events, but there are a few common aspects. There is frequently a violation of the person's core assumptions about the world and their [[human rights]], putting the person in a state of extreme [[Mental confusion|confusion]] and insecurity. This is seen when institutions depended upon for survival violate, humiliate, [[Betrayal Trauma|betray]], or cause major losses or separations instead of evoking aspects like positive self worth, safe boundaries and personal freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=DePrince, A.P.|author2=Freyd, J.J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2002|chapter=The Harm of Trauma: Pathological fear, shattered assumptions, or betrayal?|editor=J.

Psychologically traumatic experiences often involve [[physical trauma]] that threatens one's survival and sense of security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emotional and Psychological Trauma|url=http://www.helpguide.org/mental/emotional_psychological_trauma.htm|work=Helpguide.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913234027/http://www.helpguide.org/mental/emotional_psychological_trauma.htm|archivedate=September 13, 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical causes and dangers of psychological trauma include [[harassment]], [[embarrassment]], abandonment, abusive relationships, rejection, co-dependence, physical assault, [[sexual abuse]], partner battery, [[employment discrimination]], [[police brutality]], [[corruption#Judicial corruption|judicial corruption]] and [[Judicial misconduct|misconduct]], [[bullying]], [[paternalism]], [[domestic violence]], [[indoctrination]], being the victim of an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] parent, the threat or the witnessing of violence (particularly in [[childhood]]), life-threatening [[medical condition]]s, and medication-induced trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitfield|first=Charles|title=Psychiatric drugs as agents of Trauma|journal=The International Journal of Risk and Safety in Medicine|year=2010|volume=22|issue=4|pages=195–207|url=http://iospress.metapress.com/content/17668000738187w6/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128181725/http://iospress.metapress.com/content/17668000738187w6/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=28 January 2013|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catastrophic [[natural disaster]]s such as [[earthquake]]s and [[volcanic eruption]]s, large scale transportation accidents, [[Structure fire|house or domestic fire]], [[motor vehicle accident]], mass interpersonal violence like [[war]], [[terrorist attack]]s or other mass victimization like [[sex trafficking]], being taken as a hostage or being [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] can also cause psychological trauma. Long-term exposure to situations such as extreme [[poverty]] or other forms of [[abuse]], such as [[verbal abuse]], exist independently of physical trauma but still generate psychological trauma.

Some theories suggest [[childhood trauma]] can increase one's risk for [[mental disorder]]s including [[posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] ([[PTSD]]),&lt;ref&gt;Ramos, S.M., &amp; Boyle, G.J.

Parts of the brain in a growing child are developing in a sequential and hierarchical order, from least complex to most complex. The brain's neurons are designed to change in response to the constant external signals and stimulation, receiving and storing new information. This allows the brain to continually respond to its surroundings and promote survival. Our five main sensory signals contribute to the developing brain structure and its function.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Perry (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; 
Infants and children begin to create internal representations of their external environment, and in particular, key attachment relationships, shortly after birth. Violent and victimizing attachment figures impact infants' and young children's internal representations.&lt;ref name=Schechter&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schechter DS, Zygmunt A, Coates SW, Davies M, Trabka KA, McCaw J, Kolodji A, Robinson JL|author1link=Daniel Schechter|author3link=Susan Coates|year=2007|title=Caregiver traumatization adversely impacts young children's mental representations of self and others|journal=Attachment &amp; Human Development|volume=9|issue=3|pages=187–205|doi=10.1080/14616730701453762|pmid=18007959|pmc=2078523}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more frequent a specific pattern of brain neurons is activated, the more permanent the internal representation associated with the pattern becomes.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Krenawi; Graham; Kanat-Maymon, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This causes sensitization in the brain towards the specific neural network. Because of this sensitization, the neural pattern can be activated by decreasingly less external stimuli. 
Childhood abuse tends to have the most complications with long-term effects out of all forms of trauma because it occurs during the most sensitive and critical stages of psychological development.&lt;ref name="Wingo, Aliza P. 2014"/&gt; It could also lead to violent behavior, possibly as extreme as serial murder. For example, Hickey's Trauma-Control Model suggests that "[[Childhood trauma|childhood trauma]] for serial murderers may serve as a triggering mechanism resulting in an individual's inability to cope with the stress of certain events."&lt;ref&gt;Hickey, E. W. (2010). ''Serial Murderers and Their Victims.'' Blemont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often psychodynamic aspects of trauma are overlooked even by health professionals: "If clinicians fail to look through a trauma lens and to conceptualize client problems as related possibly to current or past trauma, they may fail to see that trauma victims, young and old, organize much of their lives around repetitive patterns of reliving and warding off traumatic memories, reminders, and affects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Effects of Psychological Trauma on Children and Adolescents|url=http://mentalhealth.vermont.gov/sites/dmh/files/report/cafu/DMH-CAFU_Psychological_Trauma_Moroz.pdf|format=PDF|date=June 30, 2005|author=Moroz, Kathleen J.|publisher=Vermont Agency of Human Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
People who go through these types of extremely traumatic experiences often have certain symptoms and problems afterward. The severity of these symptoms depends on the person, the type of trauma involved, and the emotional support they receive from others.  The range of reactions to and symptoms of trauma can be wide and varied, and differ in severity from person to person. A traumatized individual may experience one or several of them.&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt;

After a traumatic experience, a person may '''re-experience''' the trauma mentally and physically, hence trauma reminders, also called [[Trauma trigger|triggers]], can be uncomfortable and even painful. Re-experiencing can damage people’s sense of safety, self, self-efficacy, as well as their ability to regulate emotions and navigate relationships. They may turn to [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive substances]] including [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] to try to escape or dampen the feelings. These triggers cause flashbacks, which are dissociative experiences where the person feels as though the events are recurring. Flashbacks can range from distraction to complete dissociation or loss of awareness of the current context. Re-experiencing of symptoms is a sign that the body and mind are actively struggling to cope with the traumatic experience.

Triggers and cues act as reminders of the trauma and can cause [[anxiety]] and other associated emotions. Often the person can be completely unaware of what these triggers are. In many cases this may lead a person suffering from traumatic disorders to engage in disruptive behaviors or self-destructive coping mechanisms, often without being fully aware of the nature or causes of their own actions. [[Panic attack]]s are an example of a psychosomatic response to such emotional triggers.

Consequently, intense feelings of anger may frequently surface, sometimes in inappropriate or unexpected situations, as danger may always seem to be present due to re-experiencing past events. Upsetting memories such as images, thoughts, or [[flashback (psychological phenomenon)|flashback]]s may haunt the person, and [[nightmare]]s may be frequent.&lt;ref name="Loyola"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loyola.edu/campuslife/healthservices/counselingcenter/trauma.html|title=Loyola College in Maryland: Trauma and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051028034430/http://www.loyola.edu/campuslife/healthservices/counselingcenter/trauma.html|archivedate=2005-10-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Insomnia]] may occur as lurking fears and insecurity keep the person vigilant and on the lookout for danger, both day and night. Trauma doesn't only cause changes in one's daily functions, but could also lead to morphological changes. Such epigenetic changes can be passed on to the next generation, thus making genetics one of the components of psychological trauma. However, some people are born with or later develop protective factors such as genetics and sex that help lower their risk of psychological trauma.&lt;ref name="Frommberger 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frommberger|first=Ulrich|title=Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder – a Diagnostic and Therapeutic Challenge|journal=Deutsches Arzteblatt International|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The person may not remember what actually happened, while emotions experienced during the trauma may be re-experienced without the person understanding why (see [[Repressed memory|Repressed Memory]]). This can lead to the traumatic events being constantly experienced as if they were happening in the present, preventing the subject from gaining perspective on the experience. This can produce a pattern of prolonged periods of acute arousal punctuated by periods of physical and mental exhaustion. This can lead to mental health disorders like [[acute stress disorder|acute stress]] and anxiety disorder, [[traumatic grief]], [[undifferentiated somatoform disorder]], [[conversion disorder]]s, [[brief psychotic disorder]], [[borderline personality disorder]], adjustment disorder, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rothschild B|title=The body remembers: the psychophysiology of trauma and trauma treatment |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=978-0-393-70327-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, emotional exhaustion may set in, leading to distraction, and clear thinking may be difficult or impossible. [[Emotional detachment]], as well as [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]] or "numbing out" can frequently occur. Dissociating from the painful emotion includes numbing all emotion, and the person may seem emotionally flat, preoccupied, distant, or cold. Dissociation includes depersonalisation disorder, dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue, dissociative identity disorder, etc. Exposure to and re-experiencing trauma can cause neurophysiological changes like slowed myelination, abnormalities in synaptic pruning, shrinking of the hippocampus, cognitive and affective impairment. This is significant in brain scan studies done regarding higher order function assessment with children and youth who were in vulnerable environments.

Some traumatized people may feel permanently damaged when trauma symptoms do not go away and they do not believe their situation will improve. This can lead to feelings of despair, transient paranoid ideation,  loss of [[self-esteem]], profound emptiness, suicidality, and frequently [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. If important aspects of the person's self and world understanding have been violated, the person may call their own identity into question.&lt;ref name="Carlson"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ncptsd.va.gov/facts/general/fs_effects.html |title=Effects of Traumatic Experiences: A National Center for PTSD Fact Sheet |accessdate=2005-12-09 |last=Carlson |first=Eve B. |author2=Josef Ruzek  |publisher=National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder |doi= |archiveurl=http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/clients/sub.cfm?source=mhealth/factsheets/effects |archivedate=2004-06-12 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often despite their best efforts, traumatized parents may have difficulty assisting their child with emotion regulation, attribution of meaning, and containment of post-traumatic fear in the wake of the child's traumatization, leading to adverse consequences for the child.&lt;ref name=Schechter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schechter DS, Coates SW, Kaminer T, Coots T, Zeanah CH, Davies M, Schonfield IS, Marshall RD, Liebowitz MR, Trabka KA, McCaw J, Myers MM|author1link=Daniel Schechter|author2link=Susan Coates|year=2008|title=Distorted maternal mental representations and atypical behavior in a clinical sample of violence-exposed mothers and their toddlers|journal=Journal of Trauma and Dissociation|volume=9|issue=2|pages=123–149|doi=10.1080/15299730802045666|pmid=18985165|pmc=2577290}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such instances, seeking counselling in appropriate mental health services is in the best interests of both the child and the parent(s).
==Cause==

===Situational trauma===
Trauma can be caused by man-made, technological disasters and natural disasters,&lt;ref name="Neria, Y. 2008"&gt;Neria, Y., Nandi, A., &amp; Galea, S. (2008). Post-traumatic stress disorder following disasters: a systematic review. Psychological medicine, 38(4), 467–480. Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; including war, abuse, violence, mechanized accidents (car, train, or plane crashes, etc.) or medical emergencies.

Responses to psychological trauma:
Response to psychological trauma can be varied based on the type of trauma, as well as socio demographic and background factors.&lt;ref name="Neria, Y. 2008"/&gt;
There are several behavioral responses common towards stressors including the proactive, reactive, and passive responses. Proactive responses include attempts to address and correct a stressor before it has a noticeable effect on lifestyle.  Reactive responses occur after the stress and possible trauma has occurred and are aimed more at correcting or minimizing the damage of a stressful event.  A passive response is often characterized by an emotional numbness or ignorance of a stressor.

Those who are able to be proactive can often overcome stressors and are more likely to be able to cope well with unexpected situations.  On the other hand, those who are more reactive will often experience more noticeable effects from an unexpected stressor. In the case of those who are passive, victims of a stressful event are more likely to suffer from long-term traumatic effects and often enact no intentional coping actions. These observations may suggest that the level of trauma associated with a victim is related to such independent coping abilities.

There is also a distinction between trauma induced by recent situations and long-term trauma which may have been buried in the unconscious from past situations such as [[childhood abuse]]. Trauma is sometimes overcome through healing; in some cases this can be achieved by recreating or revisiting the origin of the trauma under more psychologically safe circumstances, such as with a [[Psychotherapy|therapist]].

===In psychoanalysis===
{{main article|Psychoanalysis}}

French neurologist [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] argued in the 1890s that psychological trauma was the origin of all instances of the mental illness known as [[hysteria]].  Charcot's "traumatic hysteria" often manifested as a paralysis that followed a physical trauma, typically years later after what Charcot described as a period of "incubation".
[[Sigmund Freud]], Charcot's student and the father of [[psychoanalysis]], examined the concept of psychological trauma throughout his career.  [[Jean Laplanche]] has given a general description of Freud's understanding of trauma, which varied significantly over the course of Freud's career: "An event in the subject's life, defined by its intensity, by the subject's incapacity to respond adequately to it and by the upheaval and long-lasting effects that it brings about in the psychical organization".&lt;ref name = Laplanche&gt;{{cite book |author1=Laplanche, J.  |author2=Pontalis, J.B. | year=1967 | title=The Language of Psycho-Analysis | publisher=W. W. Norton and Company | isbn=978-0-393-01105-0  | pages=465–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] claimed that what he called "[[The Real]]" had a traumatic quality external to symbolization. As an object of anxiety, Lacan maintained that The Real is "the essential object which isn't an object any longer, but this something faced with which all words cease and all categories fail, the object of anxiety ''par excellence''".&lt;ref name="seminar_II"&gt;Lacan, J., ''The Seminar of Jacques Lacan: Book II: The Ego in Freud's Theory and in the Technique of Psychoanalysis 1954–1955'' | p.164 (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1991), {{ISBN|978-0-393-30709-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stress disorders===
{{main article|Posttraumatic stress disorder|Complex post-traumatic stress disorder}}
All psychological traumas originate from stress, a physiological response to an unpleasant stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-205-23939-9|title=Physiology of Psychology|author=Carlson, Neil|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grossarth-Maticek, R., Eysenck, H.J., &amp; Boyle, G.J. (1994). An empirical study of the diathesis-stress theory of disease. ''International Journal of Stress Management, 1'', 3–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Long term stress increases the risk of poor mental health and mental disorders, which can be attributed to secretion of glucocorticoids for a long period of time. Such prolonged exposure causes many physiological dysfunctions such as the suppression of the immune system and increase in blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Seyle, H.|title=The Stress of Life|journal=McGraw Hill|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does it affect the body physiologically, but a morphological change in the hippocampus also takes place. Studies showed that extreme stress early in life can disrupt normal development of hippocampus and impact its functions in adulthood. Studies surely show a correlation between the size of hippocampus and one's susceptibility to stress disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brunson|title=Mechanisms of late-onset cognitive decline after early-life stress|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|year=2005|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In times of war, psychological trauma has been known as shell shock or [[combat stress reaction]]. Psychological trauma may cause an [[acute stress reaction]] which may lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  PTSD emerged as the label for this condition after the [[Vietnam War]] in which many veterans returned to their respective countries demoralized, and sometimes, addicted to psychoactive substances. The symptoms of PTSD must persist for at least a month for diagnosis. The main symptoms of PTSD consist of four main categories: trauma (i.e. intense fear), reliving (i.e. flashbacks), avoidance behavior (i.e. emotional numbing), and hypervigilance (i.e. continuous scanning of the environment for danger).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frommberger, Ulrich|year=2014|title=Post-traumatic stress disorder – a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge|journal=Deutsches Arzteblatt International|volume=111|issue=5|pages=59–65|doi=10.3238/arztebl.2014.0059|pmid=24612528|pmc=3952004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that about 60% of the US population reported as having experienced at least one traumatic symptom in their lives, but only a small proportion actually develops PTSD. There is a correlation between the risk of PTSD and whether or not the act was inflicted deliberately by the offender.&lt;ref name="Frommberger 2014"/&gt; Psychological trauma is treated with therapy and, if indicated, psychotropic medications.

The term ''continuous post traumatic stress disorder'' (CTSD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Straker|first=Gillian|title=The continuous traumatic stress syndrome: The single therapeutic interview|journal=Psychology and Society|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced into the trauma literature by Gill Straker (1987). It was originally used by South African clinicians to describe the effects of exposure to frequent, high levels of violence usually associated with civil conflict and political repression. The term is also applicable to the effects of exposure to contexts in which gang violence and crime are endemic as well as to the effects of ongoing exposure to life threats in high-risk occupations such as police, fire and emergency services.

As one of the processes of treatment, confrontation with their sources of trauma plays a crucial role. While debriefing people immediately after a critical incident has not been shown to reduce incidence of PTSD, coming alongside people experiencing trauma in a supportive way has become standard practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McNally RJ |author2=Bryant RA |author3=Ehlers A | title=Does early psychological intervention promote recovery from posttraumatic stress? | journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest | volume=4 | issue=2 | year=2003 | pages=45–79| doi = 10.1111/1529-1006.01421|pmid=26151755 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vicarious===
Vicarious trauma affects workers who witnesses their clients' trauma. It is more likely to occur in situations where trauma related work is the norm rather than the exception. Listening with empathy to the clients generates feeling, and seeing oneself in clients' trauma may compound the risk for developing trauma symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2008/phac-aspc/H72-21-178-2000E.pdf|title=Guidebook on Vicarious Trauma: Recommended Solutions for Anti-Violence Workers|publisher=Health Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trauma may also result if workers witness situations that happen in the course of their work (e.g. violence in the workplace, reviewing violent video tapes.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/dr-john-bradford-won-t-work-magnotta-case-because-of-ptsd-1.2571463|title=Russell Williams profiler won't work Magnotta case because of PTSD|publisher=CBC|date= March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Risk increases with exposure and with the absence of help seeking protective factors and pre-preparation of preventive strategies.

==Assessment==

As "trauma" adopted a more widely defined scope, traumatology as a field developed a more interdisciplinary approach. This is in part due to the field's diverse professional representation including: psychologists, medical professionals, and lawyers. As a result, findings in this field are adapted for various applications, from individual psychiatric treatments to sociological large-scale trauma management. However, novel fields require novel methodologies. While the field has adopted a number of diverse methodological approaches, many pose their own limitations in practical application.

The experience and outcomes of psychological trauma can be assessed in a number of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Briere, John |author2=Scott, Catherine |title=Principles of Trauma Therapy: A Guide to Symptoms, Evaluation, and Treatment |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc |location=California |year=2006 |pages=37–63 |isbn=978-0-7619-2921-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the context of a clinical interview, the risk of imminent danger to the self or others is important to address but is not the focus of assessment. In most cases, it will not be necessary to involve contacting emergency services (e.g., medical, psychiatric, law enforcement) to ensure the individuals safety; members of the individual's [[social support]] network are much more critical.

Understanding and accepting the psychological state an individual is in is paramount. There are many misconceptions of what it means for a traumatized individual to be in psychological crisis. These are times when an individual is in inordinate amounts of pain and incapable of self-comfort. If treated humanely and respectfully the individual is less likely to resort to self harm. In these situations it is best to provide a supportive, caring environment and to communicate to the individual that no matter the circumstance, the individual will be taken seriously rather than being treated as delusional. It is vital for the assessor to understand that what is going on in the traumatized person's head is valid and real. If deemed appropriate, the assessing clinician may proceed by inquiring about both the traumatic event and the outcomes experienced (e.g., post-traumatic symptoms, dissociation, [[substance abuse]], somatic symptoms, psychotic reactions). Such inquiry occurs within the context of established [[rapport]] and is completed in an empathic, sensitive, and supportive manner. The clinician may also inquire about possible relational disturbance, such as alertness to interpersonal danger, [[Abandonment (emotional)|abandonment issues]], and the need for self-protection via interpersonal control. Through discussion of interpersonal relationships, the clinician is better able to assess the individual's ability to enter and sustain a clinical relationship.

During assessment, individuals may exhibit activation responses in which reminders of the traumatic event trigger sudden feelings (e.g., [[distress (medicine)|distress]], anxiety, [[anger]]), memories, or thoughts relating to the event. Because individuals may not yet be capable of managing this distress, it is necessary to determine how the event can be discussed in such a way that will not "retraumatize" the individual. It is also important to take note of such responses, as these responses may aid the clinician in determining the intensity and severity of possible post traumatic stress as well as the ease with which responses are triggered. Further, it is important to note the presence of possible avoidance responses. Avoidance responses may involve the absence of expected activation or emotional reactivity as well as the use of avoidance mechanisms (e.g., substance use, effortful avoidance of cues associated with the event, dissociation).

In addition to monitoring activation and avoidance responses, clinicians carefully observe the individual's strengths or difficulties with affect regulation (i.e., affect tolerance and affect modulation). Such difficulties may be evidenced by mood swings, brief yet intense [[depressive episode]]s, or [[self-mutilation]]. The information gathered through observation of affect regulation will guide the clinician's decisions regarding the individual's readiness to partake in various therapeutic activities.

Though assessment of psychological trauma may be conducted in an unstructured manner, assessment may also involve the use of a structured interview. Such interviews might include the [[Clinician Administered PTSD Scale|Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale]] (CAPS; Blake et al., 1995), Acute Stress Disorder Interview (ASDI; Bryant, Harvey, Dang, &amp; Sackville, 1998), Structured Interview for Disorders of Extreme Stress (SIDES; Pelcovitz et al., 1997), Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders- Revised (SCID-D; Steinberg, 1994), and Brief Interview for post-traumatic Disorders (BIPD; Briere, 1998).

Lastly, assessment of psychological trauma might include the use of self-administered psychological tests. Individual scores on such tests are compared to normative data in order to determine how the individual's level of functioning compares to others in a sample representative of the general population. Psychological testing might include the use of generic tests (e.g., [[MMPI-2]], [[MCMI-III]], SCL-90-R) to assess non-trauma-specific symptoms as well as difficulties related to personality. In addition, psychological testing might include the use of trauma-specific tests to assess post-traumatic outcomes. Such tests might include the post-traumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS; Foa, 1995), Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS: Davidson et al., 1997), Detailed Assessment of post-traumatic Stress (DAPS; Briere, 2001), Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI: Briere, 1995), Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC; Briere, 1996), Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire (TLEQ: Kubany et al., 2000), and Trauma-related Guilt Inventory (TRGI: Kubany et al., 1996).

Children are assessed through activities and therapeutic relationship, some of the activities are play genogram, sand worlds, coloring feelings, Self and Kinetic family drawing, symbol work, dramatic-puppet play, story telling, Briere's TSCC, etc.&lt;ref name="GilATC"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eliana Gil|title=Helping Abused and Traumatized Children: Integrating Directive and Nondirective Approaches|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qe-E0CYLDqcC&amp;pg=PA28|year=2011|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-60918-474-2|pages=28, 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
A number of psychotherapy approaches have been designed with the treatment of trauma in mind—[[Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing|EMDR]], [[progressive counting (PC)]], [[somatic experiencing]], [[biofeedback]], [[Internal Family Systems Model|Internal Family Systems Therapy]], and [[sensorimotor psychotherapy]].

There is a large body of empirical support for the use of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abct.org/Information/?m=mInformation&amp;fa=_WhatIsCBTpublic|title=What is Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT)?|publisher=Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schnurr-2007"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Schnurr | first1 = PP. | last2 = Friedman | first2 = MJ. | last3 = Engel | first3 = CC. | last4 = Foa | first4 = EB. | last5 = Shea | first5 = MT. | last6 = Chow | first6 = BK. | last7 = Resick | first7 = PA. | last8 = Thurston | first8 = V. | last9 = Orsillo | first9 = SM. | last10 = Haug | first10 = Rodney | last11 = Turner | first11 = Carole | last12 = Bernardy | first12 = Nancy | title = Cognitive behavioral therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder in women: a randomized controlled trial | journal = JAMA | volume = 297 | issue = 8 | pages = 820–30 |date=Feb 2007 | doi = 10.1001/jama.297.8.820 | pmid = 17327524 | display-authors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  for the treatment of trauma-related symptoms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abct.org/Information/?m=mInformation&amp;fa=fs_TRAUMA|title=ABCT Fact Sheets: Trauma|publisher=Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]].

Studies funded by pharmaceuticals have also shown that medications such as the new anti-depressants are effective when used in combination with other psychological approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Phase-oriented treatment of structural dissociation in complex traumatization: overcoming trauma-related phobias|journal=Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation|year=2005|volume=6|issue=3|pages=11–53|vauthors=Steele K, van der Hart O, Nijenhuis ER|pmid=16172081|doi=10.1300/J229v06n03_02|citeseerx=10.1.1.130.8227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trauma therapy allows processing trauma-related memories and allows growth towards more adaptive psychological functioning. It helps to develop positive coping instead of negative coping and allows the individual to integrate upsetting-distressing material (thoughts, feelings and memories) and to resolve these internally. It also aids in growth of personal skills like resilience, ego regulation, empathy, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFMXBAAAQBAJ|title=Principles of Trauma Therapy: A Guide to Symptoms, Evaluation, and Treatment (DSM-5 Update)|first1=John N.|last1=Briere|first2=Catherine|last2=Scott|date=25 March 2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|via=Google Books|isbn=9781483351254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Processes involved in trauma therapy are:

* Psychoeducation: Information dissemination and educating in vulnerabilities and adoptable coping mechanisms.
* Emotional regulation: Identifying, countering discriminating, grounding thoughts and emotions from internal construction to an external representation.
* Cognitive processing: Transforming negative perceptions and beliefs about self, others and environment to positive ones through cognitive reconsideration or re-framing.
* Trauma processing: Systematic desensitization, response activation and counter-conditioning, titrated extinction of emotional response, deconstructing disparity (emotional vs. reality state), resolution of traumatic material (in theory, to a state in which triggers no longer produce harmful distress and the individual is able to express relief.)
* Emotional processing: Reconstructing perceptions, beliefs and erroneous expectations, habituating new life contexts for auto-activated trauma-related fears, and providing crisis cards with coded emotions and appropriate cognitions. (This stage is only initiated in pre-termination phase from clinical assessment and judgement of the mental health professional.)
* [[Gestalt therapy|Experiential]] processing: Visualization of achieved relief state and relaxation methods.

A number of complementary approaches to trauma treatment have been implicated as well, including yoga and meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pradhan|first=Basant|last2=Kluewer D’Amico|first2=Jessica|last3=Makani|first3=Ramkrishna|last4=Parikh|first4=Tapan|date=2015-07-10|title=Nonconventional interventions for chronic post-traumatic stress disorder: Ketamine, repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and alternative approaches|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15299732.2015.1046101|journal=Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=35–54|doi=10.1080/15299732.2015.1046101|issn=1529-9732}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trauma-sensitive yoga]] has been specifically developed for the purposes of use with traumatized individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Emerson|first=D.|last2=Sharma|first2=R.|last3=Chaudhry|first3=S.|last4=Turner|first4=J.|date=2009|title=Trauma-sensitive yoga: principles, practice, and research|url=|journal=International Journal of Yoga Therapy|volume=19|pages=123-128|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2165">The '''Rio Declaration on Environment and Development''', often shortened to '''Rio Declaration''', was a short document produced at the 1992 [[United Nations]] "Conference on Environment and Development" (UNCED), informally known as the [[Earth Summit]]. The Rio Declaration consisted of 27 principles intended to guide countries in future [[sustainable development]]. It was signed by over 170 countries.

==History==
The international community met twice to assess the progress made in implementing the principles of the document; first in New York in 1997 during a General Assembly Session of the UN, and then in [[Johannesburg]] in 2002. While the document helped to raise environmental awareness, evidence shows that little has been achieved in the document's environmental goals.&lt;ref name="Robbins2007"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Palmer |first1=Robert |last2=Nursey-Bray |first2=Melissa |editor1-last=Robbins |editor1-first=Paul |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Environment and Society |volume=4 |date=2007 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=Thousand Oaks |isbn=9781412927611 |pages=1512–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

The Rio Declaration proclaims 27 principles. It includes formulations of the [[precautionary principle]] (principle 15) and of the [[polluter pays principle]] (principle 16).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1071">In [[Buddhist]] context, '''saṁvṛiti''' or '''saṁvṛiti-satya''' (Sanskrit) refers to the conventional (''saṁvṛiti''), as opposed to absolute, truth or reality (''satya''). Knowledge is considered as split into three levels: The first being the ''illusory'' (called ''samvriti'', ''parikalpita'' or ''pratibhasika'' according to different schools of thought), considered false compared to the empirical (''samvriti'', ''paratantra'' or ''vyavaharika''), in turn trumped by the transcendental (''paramartha'' or ''paramarthika''). ''Compare: [[paramartha]]''

'''Shear and bending moment diagrams''' are analytical tools used in conjunction with [[structural analysis]] to help perform [[structural design]] by determining the value of [[shear force]] and [[bending moment]] at a given point of a [[structural element]] such as a [[beam bending|beam]].  These diagrams can be used to easily determine the type, size, and material of a member in a structure so that a given set of [[structural load|load]]s can be supported without [[structural failure]]. Another application of shear and moment diagrams is that the [[deflection (engineering)|deflection]] of a beam can be easily determined using either the [[Moment-area theorem|moment area method]] or the [[conjugate beam method]].

==Convention==
Although these conventions are relative and any convention can be used if stated explicitly, practicing engineers have adopted a standard convention used in design practices.

===Normal convention===
The normal convention used in most engineering applications is to label a positive shear force one that spins an element clockwise (up on the left, and down on the right). Likewise the normal convention for a positive bending moment is to warp the element in a "u" shape manner (Clockwise on the left, and counterclockwise on the right). Another way to remember this is if the moment is bending the beam into a "smile" then the moment is positive, with compression at the top of the beam and tension on the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|vauthors =Livermore C, Schmidt H, Williams J, Socrate S|title=2.001 Mechanics &amp; Materials I, Fall 2006.|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-001-mechanics-materials-i-fall-2006|publisher=MIT OpenCourseWare: Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=25 October 2013|location=Lecture 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Shear and Moment Convention.jpg|frame|Normal positive shear force convention (left) and normal bending moment convention (right).]] This convention was selected to simplify the analysis of beams. Since a horizontal member is usually analyzed from left to right and positive in the vertical direction is normally taken to be up, the positive shear convention was chosen to be up from the left, and to make all drawings consistent down from the right. The positive bending convention was chosen such that a positive shear force would tend to create a positive moment.

===Alternative drawing convention===
In [[structural engineer]]ing and in particular [[concrete]] design the positive moment is drawn on the [[Tension (physics)|tension]] side of the member. This convention puts the positive moment below the beam described above. A convention of placing moment diagram on the tension side allows for frames to be dealt with more easily and clearly. Additionally placing the moment on the tension side of the member shows the general shape of the deformation and indicates on which side of a concrete member [[rebar]] should be placed, as concrete is weak in tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moment Diagram Sign Convention Poll|url=http://eng-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=292028|publisher=[[Eng-Tips Forum]]|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calculating shear force and bending moment ==

}}
With the loading diagram drawn the next step is to find the value of the shear force and moment at any given point along the element. For a horizontal beam one way to perform this is at any point to "chop off" the right end of the beam.

The example below includes a point load, a distributed load, and an applied moment. The supports include both hinged supports and a fixed end support. The first drawing shows the beam with the applied forces and displacement constraints. The second drawing is the loading diagram with the reaction values given without the calculations shown or what most people call a [[free body diagram]]. The third drawing is the [[shear force]] diagram and the fourth drawing is the [[bending moment]] diagram. For the bending moment diagram the normal sign convention was used. Below the moment diagram are the stepwise functions for the shear force and bending moment with the functions expanded to show the effects of each load on the shear and bending functions.

The example is illustrated using [[United States customary units]]. Point loads are expressed in [[Kip (unit)|kip]]s (1 kip = 1000&amp;nbsp;lbf = 4.45&amp;nbsp;kN), distributed loads are expressed in k/ft (1 k/ft = 1 kip/ft = 14.6&amp;nbsp;kN/m), moments are expressed in ft-k (1&amp;nbsp;ft-k = 1&amp;nbsp;ft-kip = 1.356 kNm), and lengths are in ft (1&amp;nbsp;ft = 0.3048 m).

=== Step 1: Compute the reaction forces and moments ===
{{multiple image
| align     = right

| image1 = Free Body Diagram of the Beam.PNG
| caption1 = Free-body diagram of whole beam
}}

The first step obtaining the bending moment and shear force equations is to determine the reaction forces. This is done using a free body diagram of the entire beam.

The beam has three reaction forces, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; at the two supports and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; at the clamped end.  The clamped end also has a reaction couple ''M''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.  These four quantities have to be determined using two equations, the balance of forces in the beam and the balance of moments in the beam.  Four unknowns cannot be found given two independent equations in these unknown variables and hence the beam is [[statically indeterminate]].  One way of solving this problem is to use the principle of [[linear superposition]] and break the problem up into the superposition of a number of statically determinate problems.  The extra boundary conditions at the supports have to be incorporated into the superposed solution so that the deformation of the entire beam is [[compatibility (mechanics)|compatible]].

From the free-body diagram of the entire beam we have the two balance equations
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sum F = 0 ~,~~ \sum M_{A} = 0 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Summing the forces, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  -10 - (1)(15) + R_a + R_b + R_c = 0  
 &lt;/math&gt;
and summing the moments around the free end (A) we have
:&lt;math&gt;
(R_a)(10) + (R_b)(25) + (R_c)(50) - (1)(15)(17.5) -50 + M_c= 0 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
We can solve these equations for ''R''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; :
:&lt;math&gt;
   R_b = 37.5 - 1.6 R_a + 0.04 M_c
 &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
  R_c = -12.5 + 0.6 R_a - 0.04 M_c\,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
If we sum moments about the first support from the left of the beam we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  (10)(10) - (1)(15)(7.5) + (R_b)(15) + (R_c)(40) - 50 + M_c = 0 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
If we plug in the expressions for ''R''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; we get the trivial identity ''0 = 0'' which indicates that this equation is not independent of the previous two.  Similarly, if we take moments around the second support, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  (10)(25) - (R_a)(15) + (1)(15)(7.5) + (R_c)(25) - 50 + M_c = 0 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Once again we find that this equation is not independent of the first two equations.  We could also try to compute moments around the clamped end of the beam to get
:&lt;math&gt;
  (10)(50) - (R_a)(40) - (R_b)(25) + (1)(15)(32.5) - 50 + M_c = 0 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
This equation also turns out not to be linearly independent from the other two equations.  Therefore, the beam is statically indeterminate and we will have to find the bending moments in segments of the beam as functions of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Step 2: Break beam into segments ===
After the reaction forces are found, you then break the beam into pieces. The location and number of external forces on the member determine the number and location of these pieces. The first piece always starts from one end and ends anywhere before the first external force.

=== Step 3: Compute shear forces and moments - first piece ===
{{multiple image
| align     = right
| direction = vertical
| width = 300
| image1 = Section One.PNG
| caption1 = Free-body diagram of segment 1
}}
Let ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; be the shear force and bending moment respectively in a cross-section of the first beam segment. As the section of the beam moves towards the point of application of the external force the magnitudes of the shear force and moment may change. This makes the shear force and bending moment a function of the position of cross-section (in this example ''x'').

By summing the forces along this segment and summing the moments, the equations for the shear force and bending moment are obtained.  These equations are:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \sum F = -10 - V_1 = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
  \sum M_A = -V_1 x  + M_1 = 0 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
   V_1 = -10 \quad \text{and} \quad M_1 = -10x \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Step 4: Compute shear forces and moments - second piece ===
{{multiple image
| align     = right
| direction = vertical
| width = 300
| image1 = Section Two.PNG
| caption1 = Free-body diagram of segment 2
}}

Taking the second segment, ending anywhere before the second internal force, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  \sum F = -10 + R_a - (1)(x-10) - V_2 = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
  \sum M_A = R_a (10) - (1)(x-10)\frac{(x + 10)}{2} - V_2 x + M_2 = 0 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
   V_2 = R_a -x \quad \text{and} \quad 
   M_2 = -50 + R_a (x-10) - \frac{x^2}{2} \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Notice that because the shear force is in terms of x, the moment equation is squared. This is due to the fact that the moment is the integral of the shear force. The tricky part of this moment is the distributed force. Since the force changes with the length of the segment, the force will be multiplied by the distance after 10&amp;nbsp;ft. i.e. (x-10) the moment location is defined in the middle of the distributed force, which is also changing. This is where (x+10)/2 is derived from.

Alternatively, we can take moments about the cross-section to get
:&lt;math&gt;
  \sum M_A = 10x - R_a (x-10) + (1)(x-10)\frac{(x- 10)}{2} + M_2 = 0 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Again, in this case,
:&lt;math&gt;
   M_2 = -50 + R_a(x-10) - \frac{x^2}{2} \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Step 5: Compute shear forces and moments - third piece ===
{{multiple image
| align     = right
| direction = vertical
| width = 300
| image1 = Section Three.PNG
| caption1 = Free-body diagram of segment 3
}}

Taking the third segment, and summing forces, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   -10 + R_a + R_b - (1)(15) - V_3 = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
and summing moments about the cross-section, we get
:&lt;math&gt;
   (10)(x) - R_a(x-10) - R_b(x-25) + (1)(15)(x-17.5) + M_3  = 0 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, 
:&lt;math&gt;
   V_3 = 25 - R_a - R_b = R_c
 &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
   M_3 = 262.5 + R_a (x-10) + R_b (x-25)  - 25 x 
       = -675 + R_a (30  - 0.6 x) - M_c (1 - 0.04 x) + 12.5 x\,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Notice that the distributed force can now be considered one force of 15 kips acting in the middle of where it is positioned.

=== Step 6: Compute shear forces and moments - fourth piece ===
{{multiple image
| align     = right
| direction = vertical
| width = 300
| image1 = Section Four.PNG
| caption1 = Free-body diagram of segment 4
}}
Taking the fourth and final segment, a balance of forces gives
:&lt;math&gt;
  -10 + R_a + R_b - (1)(15) - V_4 = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
and a balance of moments around the cross-section leads to
:&lt;math&gt;
 (10)(x) - R_a(x-10) - R_b(x-25) + (1)(15)(x-17.5) - 50 + M_4 = 0 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Solving for ''V''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   V_4 = 25 - R_a - R_b = R_c
 &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
   M_4 = 312.5 + R_a (x-10) + R_b (x-25) - 25 x = -625 + R_a(30 - 0.6x) + M_c(0.04x -1) + 12.5x\,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
By plotting each of these equations on their intended intervals, you get the bending moment and shear force diagrams for this beam.  In particular, at the clamped end of the beam, ''x'' = 50 and we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   M_4 = M_c = -937.5 + 40 R_a + 25 R_b \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Step 7: Compute deflections of the four segments ===
We now use the [[Euler-Bernoulli beam theory]] to compute the deflections of the four segments.  The [[differential equation]] that relates the beam deflection (''w'') to the bending moment (''M'') is
:&lt;math&gt;
   \frac{d^2 w}{dx^2} = - \frac{M}{EI}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where ''E'' is the [[Young's modulus]] and ''I'' is the [[area moment of inertia]] of the beam cross-section.

Substituting the expressions for ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; into the beam equation and solving for the deflection gives us
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
     w_1 &amp; = \frac{5}{3EI}\,x^3 + C_1 + C_2\,x \\
     w_2 &amp; = \frac{1}{24EI}\,x^2\,\left[x^2 + 600 - 4 R_a(x-30)\right] + C_3 + C_4\,x \\
     w_3 &amp; = \frac{1}{100EI}\left[\frac{x^3}{3}(-625 + 30 R_a - 2 M_c) - 50 x^2(-675 + 30 R_a - M_c)\right] + C_5 + C_6\,x \\
     w_4 &amp; = \frac{1}{100EI}\left[\frac{x^3}{3}(-625 + 30 R_a - 2 M_c) - 50 x^2(-625 + 30 R_a - M_c)\right] + C_7 + C_8\,x 
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Step 8: Apply boundary conditions ===
Now we will apply displacement boundary conditions for the four segments to determine the integration constants.

For the fourth segment of the beam, we consider the boundary conditions at the clamped end where ''w''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = d''w''/d''x'' = 0 at ''x'' = 50.  Solving for ''C''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; gives
:&lt;math&gt;
   C_7 = -\frac{1250}{3EI}(-625 + M_c + 30 R_a)  \quad \text{and} \quad
   C_8 = \frac{125}{EI}(-125 + 6 R_a) \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, we can express ''w''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;
   w_4 = -\frac{1}{300EI}(x-50)^2\left[-5(6R_a - 125)(x-50) +2M_c(x+25)\right] \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Now, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at ''x'' = 37.5 (the point of application of the external couple).  Also, the slopes of the deflection curves at this point are the same, i.e., ''dw''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/''dx'' = ''dw''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/''dx''.  Using these boundary conditions and solving for ''C''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, we get
:&lt;math&gt;
   C_5 = -\frac{625}{12EI}(-5675 + 8 M_c + 240 R_a) \quad \text{and} \quad
   C_6 = \frac{250}{EI}\left(3R_a -70\right) \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Substitution of these constants into the expression for ''w''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; gives us
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
   w_3 = \frac{1}{300EI}\Bigl[&amp;30 R_a (-50 + x)^3 - 2 M_c (-50 + x)^2 (25 + x) -  \\
       &amp; 625 (-141875 + x (8400 + (-162 + x) x))\Bigr] \,.
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, at the support between segments 2 and 3 where ''x'' = 25, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''dw''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/''dx'' = ''dw''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''dx''. Using these and solving for ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; gives
:&lt;math&gt;
   C_3 = -\frac{3125}{24EI}(-1645 + 4 M_c + 64 R_a) \quad \text{and} \quad C_4 = \frac{25}{12EI}\left(-40325 + 6 M_c + 120 R_a\right)\,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
  w_2 = \frac{1}{24EI}\Bigl[ &amp; -3125 (-1645 + 4 M_c + 64 R_a) + \\
   &amp; 50 (-4025 + 6 M_c + 120 R_a) x + 120 (5 + R_a) x^2 - 4 R_a x^3 + x^4\Bigr] \,.
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
At the support between segments 1 and 2, ''x'' = 10 and ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''dw''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''dx'' = ''dw''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''dx''.  These boundary conditions give us
:&lt;math&gt;
  C_1 = -\frac{125}{24EI}(-40145 + 100 M_c + 1632 R_a)  \quad \text{and} \quad
  C_2 = \frac{25}{4EI}(-1315 + 2 M_c + 48 R_a) \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
   w_1 = \frac{5}{24EI}\left[1026125 - 39450 x + 8 x^3 + 20 M_c (-125 + 3 x) + 480 R_a (-85 + 3 x)\right] \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Step 9: Solve for ''M''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; ===
Because ''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 at ''x'' = 25, we can solve for ''M''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; to get
:&lt;math&gt;
  M_c = 175 - 7.5 R_a \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Also, since ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 at ''x'' = 10, expressing the deflection in terms of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; (after eliminating ''M''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) and solving for ''R''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, gives
:&lt;math&gt;
   R_a = 25.278  \quad \implies \quad M_c = -14.585 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Step 10: Plot bending moment and shear force diagrams ===

}}
We can now calculate the reactions ''R''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, the bending moments ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and the shear forces ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.  These expressions can then be plotted as a function of length for each segment.

=== Relationship between shear force and bending moment ===
It is important to note the relationship between the two diagrams. The moment diagram is a visual representation of the area under the shear force diagram. That is, the moment is the integral of the shear force. If the shear force is constant over an interval, the moment equation will be in terms of x (linear). If the shear force is linear over an interval, the moment equation will be quadratic (parabolic).

Another note on the shear force diagrams is that they show where external force and moments are applied. With no external forces, the piecewise functions should attach and show no discontinuity. The discontinuities on the graphs are the exact magnitude of either the external force or external moments that are applied. For example, at x = 10 on the shear force diagram, there is a gap between the two equations. This gap goes from -10 to 15.3. The length of this gap is 25.3, the exact magnitude of the external force at that point.  At section 3 on the moment diagram, there is a discontinuity of 50. This is from the applied moment of 50 on the structure. The maximum and minimum values on the graphs represent the max forces and moments that this beam will have under these circumstances.

==Relationships between load, shear, and moment diagrams==
Since this method can easily become unnecessarily complicated with relatively simple problems, it can be quite helpful to understand different relations between the loading, shear, and moment diagram. The first of these is the relationship between a distributed load  on the loading diagram and the shear diagram. Since a distributed load varies the shear load according to its magnitude it can be derived that the slope of the shear diagram is equal to the magnitude of the distributed load. The relationship between distributed load and shear force magnitude is:&lt;ref&gt;[http://emweb.unl.edu/negahban/em325/10a-shear-and-bending-moment/Shear%20stress%20in%20beams.htm Emweb.unl.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dQ}{dx} = -q&lt;/math&gt;

Some direct results of this is that a shear diagram will have a point change in magnitude if a point load is applied to a member, and a linearly varying shear magnitude as a result of a constant distributed load.
Similarly it can be shown that the slope of the moment diagram at a given point is equal to the magnitude of the shear diagram at that distance. The relationship between distributed shear force and bending moment is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beer |first=Ferdinand P. |author2=E. Russell Johnston |author3=John T. DeWolf  |title=Mechanics of Materials |pages=322–323 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-298090-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dM}{dx} = Q&lt;/math&gt;

A direct result of this is that at every point the shear diagram crosses zero the moment diagram will have a local maximum or minimum. Also if the shear diagram is zero over a length of the member, the moment diagram will have a constant value over that length. By calculus it can be shown that a point load will lead to a linearly varying moment diagram, and a constant distributed load will lead to a quadratic moment diagram.

==Practical considerations==
In practical applications the entire stepwise function is rarely written out. The only parts of the stepwise function that would be written out are the moment equations in a nonlinear portion of the moment diagram; this occurs whenever a distributed load is applied to the member. For constant portions the value of the shear and/or moment diagram is written right on the diagram, and for linearly varying portions of a member the beginning value, end value, and slope or the portion of the member are all that are required.&lt;ref name = "Hibbeler 146-148"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hibbeler |first=R.C |title=Structural Analysis |publisher=Macmillan |year=1985 |pages=146–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1524">In [[mathematics]], in the field of [[topology]], a [[topological space]] is said to be a '''shrinking space''' if every [[open cover]] admits a shrinking. A ''shrinking'' of an open cover is another open cover indexed by the same indexing set, with the property that the closure of each open set in the shrinking lies inside the corresponding original open set.&lt;ref name="egt"&gt;{{citation|title=Encyclopedia of General Topology|first1=K.

The following facts are known about shrinking spaces:

* Every shrinking space is [[normal space|normal]].&lt;ref name="egt"/&gt;
* Every shrinking space is [[countably paracompact]].&lt;ref name="egt"/&gt;
* In a [[normal space]], every locally finite, and in fact, every point finite open cover admits a shrinking.&lt;ref name="egt"/&gt;
* Thus, every normal [[metacompact space]] is a shrinking space. In particular, every [[paracompact space]] is a shrinking space.&lt;ref name="egt"/&gt;

These facts are particularly important because shrinking of open covers is a common technique in the theory of [[differential manifold]]s and while constructing functions using a [[partition of unity]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15241">A '''stalking horse''' is a figure that tests a concept with someone or mounts a challenge against someone on behalf of an anonymous third party. If the idea proves viable or popular, the anonymous figure can then declare its interest and advance the concept with little risk of failure. If the concept fails, the anonymous party will not be tainted by association with the failed concept and can either drop the idea completely or bide its time and wait until a better moment for launching an attack.

In hunting, it refers to a horse, or a figure of a horse, behind which a hunter hides when stalking game.

==Origin==
[[File:RO(1875) P215 APPROACHING THE FOWL WITH STALKING-HORSE.jpg|thumb|"Approaching the fowl with stalking-horse", an 1875 illustration of a cut-out horse shape used in hunting]]
The term ''stalking horse'' originally derived from the practice of [[hunting]],&lt;ref name="finn"/&gt; particularly of [[wildfowl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=s&amp;p=39 |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunters noticed that many birds would flee immediately on the approach of humans, but would tolerate the close presence of animals such as [[horse]]s and [[cattle]].

Hunters would therefore slowly approach their quarry by walking alongside their horses, keeping their upper bodies out of sight until the flock was within firing range. Animals trained for this purpose were called ''stalking horses''. Sometimes mobile [[Bird hide|hides]] are used for a similar purpose.

An example of the practice figures in the 1972 film ''[[Jeremiah Johnson (film)|Jeremiah Johnson]]'', when Johnson and Chris Lapp ("Bear Claw") are hunting elk in the Rockies:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;''Jeremiah'': Wind's right, but he'll just run soon as we step out of these trees.
''Bear Claw'': Trick to it. Walk out on this side of your horse.
''Jeremiah'': What if he sees our feet?
''Bear Claw'': Elk don't know how many feet a horse has!&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068762/quotes Jeremiah Johnson (1972) - Memorable quotes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Usage==
{{refimprove|section|date=March 2013}}
The term began appearing in Anglophone newspapers in the late 18th century. It was used to describe the Protestant branch of Christianity as "a stalking horse to power" in Ireland in 1785.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/61258150/?terms=%22stalking+horse%22|title=8 Apr 1785, Page 4 - The Belfast Mercury or Freeman's Chronicle at Newspapers.com|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples of its use in a political context occurred in the London newspaper ''[[The Observer]]'' in 1796,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/257659589/?terms=%22stalking+horse%22|title=18 Dec 1796, 3 - The Observer at Newspapers.com|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Connecticut Courant]]'' in the USA in 1808&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/233739670/?terms=%22stalking+horse%22|title=24 Feb 1808, Page 1 - Hartford Courant at Newspapers.com|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald|Sydney Morning Herald]]'' in Australia in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2181339|title=To the Editor of the Sydney Gazette.|date=1822-09-27|work=Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser (NSW : 1803 - 1842)|access-date=2017-12-03|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression is generally used in [[politics]] and business. In politics, the circumstances may include an attempt to bring down a powerful leader, usually by members of their own [[Political party|party]]. They may also include the presentation of a bill by a minor party representative, who is also acting in the interests of a silent partner such as a larger, more risk averse, political party. In business, the circumstances are an attempt at [[testing the market]] for a potential (hostile) [[takeover]] of a [[business]]. In each case, there is the clear understanding that the anonymous party, whether a company or an individual, has a valuable reputation that could be damaged by the failure. The stalking horse is an exercise in assessing accurately the degree of risk, so that a full-blooded challenge is only mounted by the main party when there is a real likelihood of success.

The loser in the exercise appears to be the stalking horse. If the idea is viable or popular, the stalking horse person will be sidelined and the anonymous figure will take over the concept themselves. If the concept proves unpopular, the stalking horse will suffer any negative reaction. The understanding is that the anonymous party is a major player, perhaps only a little weaker than the target itself, and the stalking horse is a minor figure who has little or no reputation to lose. The anonymous figure is not sufficiently powerful, or does not have sufficient confidence in that power, to risk a direct attack first off, and the stalking horse is a form of [[distraction tactic]] to enable better positioning.

In politics, the stalking horse figure can expect [[patronage]] from the senior figure they are assisting. In business, an associated company that acts as a stalking horse may be given a share in the contracts or the [[market share]] that will result from the demise of the business rival. The loyalty in volunteering, or agreeing to be "volunteered", will ensure that their name becomes known to those with power and should guarantee help in advancing their interests. As a weaker player, they can afford to wait a while for the due reward.

Alternatively, the "horse" may be acting in a more [[Altruism|altruistic]] and self-sacrificial manner, knowing that there is no possibility of realistic reward from the third party for the exercise, and instead being motivated by duty or loyalty to do so for the greater good of the party, organization, or cause to which they both belong. In this case, the "horse" will probably not be a young person hoping for advancement, but an older figure at the end of their career, who volunteers as a gesture of gratitude for all the benefits they believe the cause has given them, or as a [[Forlorn hope|chance to go out in a blaze of glory]].

In the event of failure, the anonymous party is seen as being sufficiently powerful to protect the "horse" from any real retribution on the part of the target, particularly since the anonymity will allow the third party to step in and pretend to be an [[honest broker]] between the "horse" and the target. This is a further opportunity to enhance the reputation of the third party and boost their status at the expense of the target. If the exercise is viable, the third party gains power immediately, but even if it fails it engineers an opportunity to resolve a [[Stalemate#Stalemate as a metaphor|stalemate]] and enhance the contender's reputation, so that ultimate success is another step nearer, to the benefit of both the third party and the "horse", who expects to [[slipstream]] in its wake.&lt;ref name="finn"&gt;{{cite web|last=Politi |first=Daniel |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2088794/ |title=What exactly is a "stalking horse"? - By Ed Finn - Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kathleen-reardon/is-north-korea-a-chinese-_b_24433.html |title=Kathleen Reardon: Is North Korea a Chinese Stalking-horse? - Politics on The Huffington Post |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2006-07-05 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.aol.com/political-machine/2007/10/03/a-symbolic/ |title=A Symbolic Stalking Horse - Political Machine |publisher=News.aol.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related concepts==
{{Original research section|date=December 2017}}
One related concept is the [[smoke screen]]. Like a stalking horse, smoke screens are used to screen and mask an attack. In the literal and genuine form, the smoke screen is still a device used in warfare (in defence as well as attack), but the term is also commonly used as a metaphor. A stalking horse would be a particular form of smoke screen.

Another concept is that of [[kite-flying (politics)|kite-flying]]. The stalking horse pretends to be interested in a concept themselves, but in reality they are testing an idea for another. Likewise, in journalism, the term "flying a kite" takes the metaphor of the child's toy to mean advancing a concept in which one has no personal belief, or for which one has no reliable evidence, as a similar exercise in "testing the waters". Another similar metaphor is that of a [[trial balloon]]. Different examples may provoke different responses. Some may be directed to play to the readers themselves. The idea is "to provoke a response where otherwise there would be none". Like the stalking horse, the means is to use a spurious debate to provoke a real one. The difference is that the concept is advanced, not an individual. In one form of "flying a kite", a journalist claims to be acting on a behalf of a real but anonymous person, while in reality they are acting for themselves; this would be the opposite of the stalking horse.  

Another concept is [[collusion]]. The difference here is that collusion usually refers to the situation of the first and third parties both declaring themselves openly to the target, but each pretends to be independent of anyone else and acting solely for themselves, whilst in reality they are acting in concert, in [[common purpose|joint enterprise]] and to mutual advantage, at the expense of the target. If one party acts aggressively and the other sympathetically towards the target, it may be an example of [[good cop/bad cop]]. In the stalking horse scenario, the first and third parties are still acting in concert and in joint enterprise and still at the expense of the target, but only the first party, the "horse", is openly dealing with the target. In addition, they are not acting to immediate mutual advantage; rather, they are acting to advantage only the third party (the anonymous party), who, at a later date, should in turn give reward to the first party (the "horse").       

Another related idiom is that of the puppet-master. One person (the "horse") dances like a puppet on the stage, but another (the anonymous figure) is the one who is actually pulling the strings, unseen by all. The stalking horse appears to be acting for and as themselves, but there are others in the shadows. The difference is that the [[éminence grise]] or puppet-master is definitely controlling the puppet, but the stalking horse may not always be acting on the orders of, or to the benefit of, a particular individual; they may instead be acting for a cause, in the hope that some individual will be inspired to enter the fray and take over. 

The concept of a "[[Pawn (chess)#Etymology and word usage|sacrificial pawn]]" is also in some ways similar to that of the stalking horse. In the game of chess, a pawn may be advanced in the knowledge that it will definitely be lost, but will, in so doing, force out an enemy piece of much higher value and make that piece much more susceptible to attack. This image is also in common usage as an metaphor. The difference with the stalking horse is that not only is the outcome not known at the outset but, furthermore, that it cannot reasonably be estimated without a proper [[reconnaissance]]. Therefore, unlike the pawn, the horse might have a good chance of survival. Either way, the "horse" will not benefit from the initial exercise.

==Examples==
===In politics===
The phenomenon occurs particularly in politics, where a junior politician acts as the stalking horse to promote the interests of a senior politician, who remains unseen in case the actions would damage him or her but nevertheless wants to provoke a debate or challenge to a party colleague. In some cases, stalking horses are not working for a particular individual but may wish to provoke a response that leads others to join in. In politics, the truth about the relationship between an individual stalking horse and a candidate may never be known, as both sides may claim that the (alleged) stalking horse acted without the agreement of anyone else.

For example, in Britain, the elderly and largely unknown [[Backbencher|back-bench]] politician [[Anthony Meyer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4160013.stm |title=Politics &amp;#124; Tory 'stalking horse' Meyer dies |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-01-09 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fandmpublications.co.uk/pages/incidents1.htm |title=Events and Incidents |publisher=Fandmpublications.co.uk |date=1984-03-05 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; challenged and helped to bring about the eventual resignation of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leadership.

In American politics, [[George W. Romney]] believed that [[Nelson Rockefeller]] had used him as a stalking horse in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1968|1968 Republican Party presidential primaries]] by promising support, then not providing it and hinting at his own entry into the campaign.&lt;ref name="lemann20121001"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/10/01/transaction-man | title=Transaction Man | work=The New Yorker | date=2012-10-01 | accessdate=2 October 2016 | author=Lemann, Nicholas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another suspected example: After the 2016 presidential election, [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] candidate [[Jill Stein]] demanded recounts in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania (all of which [[Donald Trump]] won in close contests), presumably for Hillary Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2017/04/25/the-biggest-story-of-trumps-first-100-days-his-survival/|title=The biggest story of Trump’s first 100 days? His survival|last=Goodwin|first=Michael|date=2017-04-26|website=New York Post|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In bankruptcy===

In [[bankruptcy]], a [[Stalking horse offer|stalking horse bid]] is a first, favorable bid solicited by the bankrupt company's creditors strategically to prevent [[low-ball]] offers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stalkinghorsebid.asp |title=Stalking-Horse Bid |publisher=Investopedia.com |date=1993-04-02 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bowne.com/securitiesconnect/details.asp?storyID=1493 |title=Stalking Horse Bidders Try To Calm Creditors And Courts &amp;#124; Bowne Review |publisher=Bowne.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8528">:''Not to be confused with [[statuary]], [[statutory]] etc.''

'''Statary''' is a term currently applied in fields such as [[ecology]], [[ethology]], [[psychology]]. In modern use it contrasts on the one hand with such concepts as ''migratory'', ''nomadic'', or ''shifting'', and on the other with ''static'' or ''immobile''. The word also is of historical interest in its change of meaning as its usage changed.

==Current usage==
In current usage in fields such as biology, '''[[Wiktionary:statary|statary]]''' commonly means ''in a particular location or state, '''but not rigidly so'''''. [[Army ant]] colonies for example are said to be in a ''statary phase'' when they occupy one bivouac for an extended period instead of just overnight. This is as opposed to a ''nomadic phase'', in which they travel and forage practically daily. This does not mean that ant colonies in a statary phase do not move nor even that they do not forage while statary; they often do both, sometimes daily. Correspondingly a colony in a nomadic phase does not travel without rest; it bivouacs for the night. The significance of the terms is that the colonies' behaviour patterns differ radically according to their activity phase; one pattern favours maintaining a persistent presence where brood is being raised, whereas the other favours continual nomadic wandering into new foraging grounds.&lt;ref name="MSPP"&gt;Maier, Norman Raymond Frederick; Schneirla, Théodore Christian. Principles of animal psychology. McGraw-Hill 1935&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "AAGWH"&gt;Gotwald, William H. Army Ants: The Biology of Social Predation. Publisher: Cornell University Press 1995. {{ISBN|978-0801426339}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such phases have raised interest in studies in aspects of comparative psychology&lt;ref&gt;Oyama, Susan; Griffths, Paul E.; Gray, Russell D. (editors) Cycles of Contingency: Developmental Systems and Evolution. 2001 {{ISBN|0-262-15053-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Reeson, A. F.; Wilson, K.; Gunn,  A.; Hails,  R. S.; Goulson, D. Baculovirus resistance in the noctuid Spodoptera exempta is phenotypically plastic and responds to population density. doi: 10.1098/rspb.1998.0503 Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 22 September 1998 vol. 265 no. 1407 1787-1791&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''statary'' also applies in contexts other than ants or colonial organisms. Swarm-forming species of [[locust]]s go beyond having statary and nomadic phases of behaviour; their growing [[Nymph (biology)|nymphs]] actually develop into different adult morphologies, depending on whether the conditions during their growth favour swarming or not. Locusts that adopt the swarming morphology are said to be the migratory [[Polymorphism (biology)|morphs]], while the rest are called statary morphs.&lt;ref name="MJWEDPE"&gt;West-Eberhard, Mary Jane. Developmental Plasticity and Evolution. Publisher: Oxford University Press 2003. {{ISBN|978-0195122350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively similar morphs occur in some other insect species, such as [[Fall armyworm|army worm]].&lt;ref name="LIR"&gt;Leather, Hardie, Jim. Insect Reproduction. Publisher: CRC Press 1995. {{ISBN|978-0849366956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some technical fields ''statary'' need not refer literally to location or motion, but refer figuratively to their having particular characteristic but non-rigid attributes, such as atmospheric pressure. The following section instances examples of such senses occurring in the history of the term.

==Historical usage==
'''Statary''', from the Latin root ''statarius'', meaning  "standing fast", first came into prominent use in the English language in ''Positions'', the work of [[Richard Mulcaster]] in the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=OEDJHM&gt;Murray, J.A.H. The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary (2 vols). Publisher: Oxford University Press. 1971. {{ISBN|978-0198611172}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke of ''statarie substance'' much as, in contemporary English, one might speak of [[fixed asset]]s or fixed property: "...either rich or poore : landed or unlanded, which is either the having or wanting of the most '''statarie''' substance." It is unclear whether he coined the English version of the word.

[[Samuel Collins (theologian)|Samuel Collins]] also used the word "statary" in the slightly different sense of "ordinary" or "normal" in his 1617 defence of the Bishop of Elie, [[Lancelot Andrewes]]: "What is this [in comparison], ... not ... to their stately, but even statarie and ordinarie supremacie in the Church?".

In his ''Pseudodoxia Epidemica''&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Thomas, Sir, (ed. Wilkin, Simon). The works of Sir Thomas Browne Vol 2. Pub. London : G. Bell. 1888) [Download from: https://archive.org/details/worksofsirthomas02brow]&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Thomas Browne]] used the word in at least two senses; firstly he used it as meaning ''fixed'' or ''regular'', as in "...perturbed the observation of festivities and '''''statary''''' solemnities..." secondly he used it in contrast to ''anniversary'' (by which he meant "annual" or "seasonal") as in: "...we might expect a regularity in the winds ; whereof though some be statary, some anniversary, and the rest do tend to determine points of heaven, yet do the blasts and undulary breaths thereof maintain no certainty in their course..." In this passage he explicitly does not assert the self-contradiction that winds might be static, but rather that they are unceasing, though variable. In this sense Browne's usage is consistent with the modern technical application.

The word ''statary'' appeared in sundry works after Browne's time, for example in the [[Literary Gazette]] in the ''Meteorological Journal'', the word was used in reference to winds and barometric readings in much the same sense as that in which Browne had referred to statary winds.&lt;ref&gt;William Jerdan, Lovell Augustus Reeve et al (eds) The Literary gazette: A weekly journal of literature, science, and the fine arts, Volume 5 (Google eBook) 1821, Meteorological Journal, pp. 527, 752&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lancelot Addison]] referred to "statary prayers" in his account of his seven years in West Barbary, published in 1671. However, the word never seems to have come into common use, though it did appear in various dictionaries, such as [[Samuel Johnson]]'s 1755 [[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary of the English Language]]. Such entries did not generally refer to any distinction between the various senses, and in fact some used words such as "stationary" in their definitions, apparently feeling no need for a separate term for the concept of something that has a non-rigid general location around specific coordinates. Accordingly the word was marked as obsolete by the compilers of the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] published in the late 19th to early 20th century,&lt;ref name=OEDJHM/&gt; and [[Webster's Dictionary]] did likewise in the 1913 unabridged edition.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Noah. Webster's revised unabridged dictionary of the English language. Publisher: Merriam 1913&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]] in turn omitted the entry altogether.&lt;ref name= "isbn0-19-861271-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford [Eng.] |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-19-861271-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If it had not been resurrected in the role of a technical term, the word ''statary'' probably would have disappeared from the language by now. In the sense of "rigidly stationary" it patently is redundant, but in the sense of loosely remaining at particular coordinates, it fills a need in certain fields such as in biology and climatology.

A related sense appeared in the 1623 translation of [[Xenophon]] by John Bingham.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, (tr. Bingham, John). The Historie of Xenophon. 1623. Publ: Theatrum Orbis Terrarum. {{ISBN|9789022107041}}&lt;/ref&gt; As applied to soldiers, statary means: equipped for stationary combat as opposed to [[Skirmisher|skirmishing]].&lt;ref name=OEDJHM/&gt;

Eventually, about the early 1930s, the word began to reappear in articles and textbooks, particularly on biological topics. For example, it was used in a prominent textbook of the day,&lt;ref name="MSPP"/&gt; [[Norman Maier]] and associates were applying the concept to ant behaviour; it seems that [[Myrmecology|T. C. Schneirla]] had elected to use the term in 1932. It had proved useful, and by the end of the 20th century the word was in fairly common use, as can be seen from [[Google Ngram Viewer]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16515">A '''statistical model''' is a [[mathematical model]] that embodies a set of [[statistical assumptions]] concerning the generation of some [[Sample (statistics)|sample data]] and similar data from a larger [[Statistical population|population]]. A statistical model represents, often in considerably idealized form, the data-generating process.

The assumptions embodied by a statistical model describe a set of [[probability distribution]]s, some of which are assumed to adequately approximate the distribution from which a particular data set is sampled. The probability distributions inherent in statistical models are what distinguishes statistical models from other, non-statistical, mathematical models.

A statistical model is usually specified by mathematical equations that relate one or more [[random variables]] and possibly other non-random variables.  As such, a statistical model is "a formal representation of a theory" ([[Herman J. Adèr|Herman Adèr]] quoting [[Kenneth A. Bollen|Kenneth Bollen]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adèr|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LCnOj4ZFyjkC&amp;pg=PA280 280]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All [[Statistical hypothesis testing|statistical hypothesis tests]] and all [[Estimator|statistical estimators]] are derived from statistical models. More generally, statistical models are part of the foundation of [[statistical inference]].

==Introduction==
Informally, a statistical model can be thought of as a [[statistical assumption]] (or set of statistical assumptions) with a certain property: that the assumption allows us to calculate the probability of any [[event (probability theory)|event]]. As an example, consider a pair of ordinary six-sided [[dice]]. We will study two different statistical assumptions about the dice.

The first statistical assumption is this: for each of the dice, the probability of each face (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) coming up is {{sfrac|1|6}}. From that assumption, we can calculate the probability of both dice coming up 1:&amp;thinsp; {{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|6}} × {{sfrac|1|6}}&amp;ensp;{{=}}}}&amp;ensp;{{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|36}}.&amp;thinsp;}} More generally, we can calculate the probability of any event: e.g. (1 and 2) or (3 and 3) or (4 and 6). 

The alternative statistical assumption is this: for each of the dice, the probability of the face 1 coming up is {{sfrac|1|8}} (because the dice are [[Dice#Loaded_dice|weighted]]). From that assumption, we can calculate the probability of both dice coming up 1:&amp;thinsp; {{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|8}} × {{sfrac|1|8}}&amp;ensp;{{=}}}}&amp;ensp;{{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|64}}.&amp;thinsp;}} We cannot, however, calculate the probability of any other nontrivial event. 

The first statistical assumption constitutes a statistical model: because with the assumption alone, we can calculate the probability of any event. The alternative statistical assumption does ''not'' constitute a statistical model: because with the assumption alone, we cannot calculate the probability of every event.

In the example above, with the first assumption, calculating the probability of an event is easy. With some other examples, though, the calculation can be difficult, or even impractical (e.g. it might require millions of years of computation). For an assumption to constitute a statistical model, such difficulty is acceptable: doing the calculation does not need to be practicable, just theoretically possible.

==Formal definition==
In mathematical terms, a statistical model is usually thought of as a pair (&lt;math&gt;S, \mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;), where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the set of possible observations, i.e. the [[sample space]], and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; is a set of [[probability distributions]] on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="McCullagh"&gt;{{Harvnb | McCullagh | 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intuition behind this definition is as follows.  It is assumed that there is a "true" probability distribution induced by the process that generates the observed data.  We choose &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; to represent a set (of distributions) which contains a distribution that adequately approximates the true distribution. Note that we do not require that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; contains the true distribution, and in practice that is rarely the case. Indeed, as Burnham &amp; Anderson state, "A model is a simplification or approximation of reality and hence will not reflect all of reality"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Burnham | Anderson | 2002 | loc= §1.2.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;whence the saying "[[all models are wrong]]".

The set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; is almost always parameterized: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}=\{P_{\theta} : \theta \in \Theta\}&lt;/math&gt;. The set &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; defines the [[Statistical parameter|parameters]] of the model. A parameterization is generally required to have distinct parameter values give rise to distinct distributions, i.e. &lt;math&gt;P_{\theta_1} = P_{\theta_2} \Rightarrow \theta_1 = \theta_2&lt;/math&gt; must hold (in other words, it must be [[Injective function|injective]]). A parameterization that meets the requirement is said to be ''[[Identifiability|identifiable]]''.&lt;ref name="McCullagh" /&gt;

==An example==
Suppose that we have a population of school children, with the ages of the children distributed [[Discrete uniform distribution|uniformly]], in the population. The height of a child will be [[stochastic]]ally related to the age: e.g. when we know that a child is of age 7, this influences the chance of the child being 5 feet tall. We could formalize that relationship in a [[linear regression]] model, like this: 
height&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;age&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the intercept, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a parameter that age is multiplied by in obtaining a prediction of height, ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the error term, and ''i'' identifies the child. This implies that height is predicted by age, with some error.

An admissible model must be consistent with all the data points.  Thus, a straight line (height&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;age&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) cannot be the equation for a model of the data—unless it exactly fits all the data points, i.e. all the data points lie perfectly on the line.  The error term, ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, must be included in the equation, so that the model is consistent with all the data points.

To do [[statistical inference]], we would first need to assume some probability distributions for the ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.  For instance, we might assume that the ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; distributions are [[i.i.d.]] Gaussian, with zero mean.  In this instance, the model would have 3 parameters: ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and the variance of the Gaussian distribution.

We can formally specify the model in the form (&lt;math&gt;S, \mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;) as follows.  The sample space, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, of our model comprises the set of all possible pairs (age, height).  Each possible value of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;= (''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) determines a distribution on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;; denote that distribution by &lt;math&gt;P_{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all possible values of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}=\{P_{\theta} : \theta \in \Theta\}&lt;/math&gt;. (The parameterization is identifiable, and this is easy to check.)

In this example, the model is determined by (1) specifying &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and (2) making some assumptions relevant to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;. There are two assumptions: that height can be approximated by a linear function of age; that errors in the approximation are distributed as i.i.d. Gaussian.  The assumptions are sufficient to specify &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;mdash;as they are required to do.

==General remarks==
A statistical model is a special class of [[mathematical model]]. What distinguishes a statistical model from other mathematical models is that a statistical model is non-[[Deterministic system|deterministic]]. Thus, in a statistical model specified via mathematical equations, some of the variables do not have specific values, but instead have probability distributions; i.e. some of the variables are [[Random variable|stochastic]]. In the example above, ε is a stochastic variable; without that variable, the model would be deterministic.

Statistical models are often used even when the physical process being modeled is deterministic. For instance, [[coin tossing]] is, in principle, a deterministic process; yet it is commonly modeled as stochastic (via a [[Bernoulli process]]).

There are three purposes for a statistical model, according to Konishi&amp;nbsp;&amp; Kitagawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Konishi | Kitagawa | 2008 | loc= &amp;sect;1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dimension of a model==
Suppose that we have a statistical model (&lt;math&gt;S, \mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;) with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}=\{P_{\theta} : \theta \in \Theta\}&lt;/math&gt;.  The model is said to be ''[[Parametric model|parametric]]'' if &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; has a finite dimension. In notation, we write that &lt;math&gt;\Theta \subseteq \mathbb{R}^k&lt;/math&gt; where {{mvar|k}} is a positive integer (&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[real numbers]]; other sets can be used, in principle).  Here, {{mvar|k}} is called the '''dimension''' of the model.

As an example, if we assume that data arise from a univariate [[Gaussian distribution]], then we are assuming that  
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}=\left\{P_{\mu,\sigma }(x) \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma} \exp\left( -\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) : \mu \in \mathbb{R}, \sigma &gt; 0 \right\}&lt;/math&gt;. 
In this example, the dimension, {{mvar|k}}, equals 2.

As another example, suppose that the data consists of points ({{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}) that we assume are distributed according to a straight line with i.i.d. Gaussian residuals (with zero mean).  Then the dimension of the statistical model is 3: the intercept of the line, the slope of the line, and the variance of the distribution of the residuals.  (Note that in geometry, a straight line has [[dimension]] 1.)

Although formally &lt;math&gt;\theta \in \Theta&lt;/math&gt; is a single parameter that has dimension {{mvar|k}}, it is sometimes regarded as comprising {{mvar|k}} separate parameters. For example, with the univariate Gaussian distribution, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is a single parameter with dimension 2, but it is sometimes regarded as comprising 2 separate parameters—the mean and the standard deviation.

A statistical model is [[Nonparametric statistics#Non-parametric models|''nonparametric'']] if the parameter set &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; is infinite dimensional.  A statistical model is [[Semiparametric model|''semiparametric'']] if it has both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional parameters.  Formally, if {{mvar|k}} is the dimension of &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; and {{mvar|n}} is the number of samples, both semiparametric and nonparametric models have &lt;math&gt;k \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;k/n \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;, then the model is semiparametric; otherwise, the model is nonparametric.

Parametric models are by far the most commonly used statistical models. Regarding semiparametric and nonparametric models, [[David Cox (statistician)|Sir David Cox]] has said, "These typically involve fewer assumptions of structure and distributional form but usually contain strong assumptions about independencies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Cox | 2006 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nested models==
{{distinguish|Multilevel models|}}
Two statistical models are '''nested''' if the first model can be transformed into the second model by imposing constraints on the parameters of the first model. As an example, the set of all Gaussian distributions has, nested within it, the set of zero-mean Gaussian distributions: we constrain the mean in the set of all Gaussian distributions to get the zero-mean distributions. As a second example, the quadratic model 
:{{math|''y''&amp;nbsp;{{=}} ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&amp;nbsp;+ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ε,&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ε&amp;nbsp;~ 𝒩(0, ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} 
has, nested within it, the linear model 
:{{math|''y''&amp;nbsp;{{=}} ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&amp;nbsp;+ ε,&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ε&amp;nbsp;~ 𝒩(0, ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}
—we constrain the parameter {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} to equal 0.

In both those examples, the first model has a higher dimension than the second model (for the first example, the zero-mean model has dimension&amp;nbsp;1).  Such is often, but not always, the case.  As a different example, the set of positive-mean Gaussian distributions, which has dimension 2, is nested within the set of all Gaussian distributions.

==Comparing models==
{{main | Model selection}}
It is assumed that there is a "true" probability distribution underlying the observed data, induced by the process that generated the data. The main goal of [[model selection]] is to make statements about which elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; are most likely to adequately approximate the true distribution.

Models can be compared to each other by [[exploratory data analysis]] or [[confirmatory data analysis]]. In exploratory analysis, a variety of models are formulated and an assessment is performed of how well each one describes the data. In confirmatory analysis, a previously formulated model or models are compared to the data. Common criteria for comparing models include [[Coefficient of determination|''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Bayes factor]], and the [[likelihood-ratio test]] together with its generalization [[Likelihood function#Relative likelihood|relative likelihood]].

Konishi &amp; Kitagawa state: "The majority of the problems in statistical inference can be considered to be problems related to statistical modeling. They are typically formulated as comparisons of several statistical models."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Konishi | Kitagawa | 2008 | page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, [[David Cox (statistician)|Sir David Cox]] has said, "How [the] translation from subject-matter problem to statistical model is done is often the most critical part of an analysis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Cox | 2006 | page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sunwoo Hwi''' was a modern [[South Korea]]n author and novelist.&lt;ref&gt;”Sunwoo Hwi" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055413/http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do |date=2013-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Sunwoo Hwi was born on January 3, 1922 in [[Chongju]], [[North Pyongan Province|Pyeonganbuk-do]], Korea (in what is now [[North Korea]]).&lt;ref name="Lee1996"&gt;{{cite book|title=Who's Who in Korean Literature|chapter=Song Hui|pages=475–477|author=Lee, Kyung-ho|publisher=Hollym|location=Seoul|year=1996|isbn=1-56591-066-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A writer poet, journalist, soldier and philosopher he also fought in the [[Korean War]] from 1950 to 1952.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121219184455/http://people.aks.ac.kr/front/tabCon/ppl/pplView.aks?pplId=PPL_7KOR_A1921_1_0005588&amp;category=dirSer Sunwoo Hwe:Korean historical person information] {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; poet, journalist, soldier and philosopher. He was a famous realist and anticommunist writer and journalist.  Hwi graduated from Gyeongseong Teachers School in 1944. He worked as a reporter for Chosun Ilbo before enlisting in the army in 1949 as an information and education officer. He made his literary debut in 1955 with the publication of his story "Ghost" (Gwisin).&lt;ref&gt;"Sunwoo Hwi" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055413/http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do |date=2013-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
The Korea Literature Translation Institute summarized Hwi's work:

:Behavioral humanism, or the expression of an active will in dire situations, characterizes Sunwoo Hwi’s literary world. “Flowers of Fire” (Bulkkot), for which he first gained recognition, features a man who overcomes his escapist mentality to embrace the spirit of resistance. As revealed in “Flowers of Fire” as well as in the novels Flagman Without a Flag (Gitbal eomneun gisu) and The Finale of the Chase (Chujeogui pinalle), the will to act is rooted in respect for mankind and desire to oppose dehumanization. For Sunwoo Hwi, the responsibility of intellectuals includes active participation in the affairs of the society and resistance to dehumanization caused by ideological conflicts and social ills. The humanistic approach, however, is overemphasized in works such as Myth of Bush-clover Village (Ssaritgorui sinhwa), giving the work the feel of an imaginary world removed from contemporary reality. After 1965, Sunwoo Hwi began to evince a more conservative attitude towards the establishment. “Golgotha Without Cross” (Sipjaga eomneun golgoda), “A Thirteen-Year-Old Boy” (Yeol sesarui sonyeon) and “A Funny Story About Funny People” focus on nostalgia for lost childhood homes, and The Jackpot (Nodaji), serialized in Chosun Weekly from 1979 to 1981, is a family chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;Source-attribution|"Sunwoo Hwi" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055413/http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do |date=2013-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19274">A '''taunt''' is a [[battle cry]], sarcastic remark, gesture, or insult intended to demoralize the recipient, or to anger them and encourage reactionary behaviors without thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keltner|first1=Dacher|last2=Capps|first2=Lisa|last3=Kring|first3=Ann M.|last4=Young|first4=Randall C.|last5=Heerey|first5=Erin A.|title=Just teasing: A conceptual analysis and empirical review|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=March 2001|volume= 127 |issue= 2|pages=229–248|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/|accessdate=18 November 2015|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.127.2.229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taunting can exist as a form of social competition to gain control of the target's [[cultural capital]] (i.e. [[social status|status]]).{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} In [[sociological]] theory, the control of the three social capitals is used to produce an advantage in the social hierarchy as to enforce one's own position in relation to others. Taunting is committed by either directly, or indirectly encouraging others to taunt the target. The target may give a response in kind to maintain status, as in [[fighting words]] and [[trash-talk]].

Taunts are also a genre of [[folklore]].

==Verbal taunts==
The act of taunting can be learned by observation and improvisation.  It usually follows linear thought, correlating or building in some manner to the target of taunting.  Things such as the victim's appearance, intelligence, mannerisms, education, background, past offences, etc. can otherwise be insulted.  When used in this manner, the effectiveness of a taunt at provoking a response varies depending on how the specific insult relates to its victim (or their [[Ego (Freudian)|sense of self]]), to what level of offence they regard the taunt, and how well the victim can control their emotions when responding.

In the [[Eastern US]] and modern [[United Kingdom|Britain]] the chant "[[Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah]]", sung to the tune of "[[Bye, baby Bunting]]" is insult among children.&lt;ref name=Albright;2000;94&gt;D. Albright, [https://books.google.com/books?id=K8fgDZR_sn0C&amp;pg=PA94&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq=Bye+Baby+Bunting+taunting&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oV6A4PSDbU&amp;sig=Fp_CCLJrDCm9xO-rBGbh1iC1uRA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KkCJS7qxDsSxtweIgs2YCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=15&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwDg ''Untwisting the serpent: modernism in music, literature, and other arts''], . Daniel . University of Chicago Press, 2000. p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; In the American South this is often used as "Nanny nanny boo-boo" and repeated with words such as "You ca-an't catch me".  In [[Hebrew]], the taunt is "Na na, banana" or "Na-na-na banana" (means the same as in [[English language|English]]). In [[French language|French]], the taunt uses syllables often rendered "Nananananère," and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]-speaking children use the phrase "Du kan inte ta mig" ("You cannot catch me").{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} In [[Croatia]], children sing in that tune: "Ulovi me, ulovi me, kupit ću ti novine. Novine su skupe, poljubi me u dupe.", which means: "Catch me, catch me, [if you do that] I'll buy you a newspaper. Newspapers are pricey, kiss my tushie."

==Gestures==
{{Main|Gesture}}
Certain movements of one's body are, in many cultures, interpreted as a taunt. These can be expressed through the [[Human eye|eye]]s, [[hand]]s, [[finger]]s, [[head]] and other areas of the body.

===Akanbe===
{{Main|Akanbe}}
A gesture in [[Japanese culture]], made by pulling a lower eyelid down to expose the red underneath.

===Clenched fist===
A raised, clenched fist is used as a gesture of defiance by a number of groups.  It is usually considered to be hostile, yet without any sexual, scatological, or notionally offensive connotations.

===Crotch-grab===
The crotch-grab is done almost exclusively by males. It is, as the name suggests, a grabbing (or one-handed cupping and lifting) of the [[penis]] and [[testicles]] -   usually through clothing. In [[Italy]] the sign is by no means purely a taunt, being also an [[apotropaic]] gesture of considerable antiquity employed, since the days of [[Ancient Rome]],  to ward off the [[evil eye]] or bad luck and also to attract [[good luck]]. It is, in this context, an invocation of the benign powers of [[fertility]] embodied in the male [[genitalia]] and, as such, lies at the root of the [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] intent expressed symbolically in the [[fascinum]] and probably also the [[cornicello]]. Despite recent [[prudish]] rulings by the [[Law of Italy|Italian legal system]], the (public) crotch-grab is still resorted to by more traditionally-minded Italian men as a means of deflecting the ill-luck threatened by objects or people related to [[death]] and [[burial]] and (more esoterically) the [[unlucky number]] 17 (said to be unlucky because it a) resembles a man hanging from a [[gibbet]] and b) because when written XVII in Roman numerals is an anagram of 'vixi' - 'I lived', a [[Grammatical conjugation|verb form]] considered unlucky because of its frequent occurrence in ancient Roman [[funerary]] inscriptions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2008/03/cant_touch_this.html|title=Can't Touch This|first=Juliet|last=Lapidos|date=4 March 2008|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1580334/Italian-court-outlaws-touching-of-genitals.html|title=Italian court outlaws touching of genitals|first=Malcolm|last=Moore|date=29 February 2008|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cutthroat===
The [[:wikt:cutthroat|cutthroat]] gesture is performed by drawing the hand, or a finger or two, across the throat. It represents slitting the throat with a knife, and means that the gesturer or someone else is metaphorically being killed. It is rarely if ever used literally to refer to death, though it is occasionally used as a theatrical threat ("I'm going to kill you"). The gesture earned a great deal of national notoriety in the [[NFL]] during the 1999 season in which several players did the cutthroat gesture.

===Dickhead gesture===
The dickhead gesture is made by holding a hand to one's forehead, the thumb and fingers usually forming a "C" shape, and then moving the hand forward and backward in an arc. The image suggested is a large [[penis]] growing out of the forehead.

A more insulting form is where the thumb and finger are brought closer together so the gap between them is smaller and more elongated with the hand moved in the same manner. The image suggests a small [[penis]] growing out of the forehead.

===Finger===
{{Main|Finger (gesture)}}
The finger gesture is a gesture consisting of a fist with the middle finger extended. It is universally understood as "[[wikt:fuck you|fuck you]]" due to its resemblance to the [[penis]]. It is certainly thousands of years old, being referred to in Ancient Roman literature as the ''digitus infamis'' or ''digitus impudicus''. Performing this gesture is also called "flipping the bird" in countries where "the finger" is used. In other regions, "flipping the bird" refers to the raising of the middle and index finger with the back of the hand directed at the recipient. It can also mean "Victor" in some countries, which is not to be mistaken for the "Peace" gesture. The "Peace" gesture is done with the palm facing the recipient of the gesture. In Britain, this is also the case - however, if the palm faces inwards (towards the person doing the "peace" sign), it is an offensive gesture in Britain, though not considered quite as rude as to "the finger" (but still very rude and offensive).

===Loser===
{{main|Loser (hand gesture)}}
The "loser" gesture used in some countries is performed by raising the [[index finger]] and [[thumb]] of one's right hand [[perpendicular]] to each other and then placing them on one's forehead with index finger pointing upward.  So placed, the fingers form the letter "L" from the perspective of a viewer and signify the name-calling insult "loser" directed toward the person being [[Grammatical person|spoken to]] or [[grammatical person|spoken about]].

===Shocker===
{{Main|Shocker (hand gesture)}}
Done by holding up the hand with the index, middle and pinky finger, implying the act of putting two fingers in a woman's vagina and one in her anus.

===Tongue===
Often sticking one's [[tongue]] out at another is seen as mocking the other. A variation of this is also known as [[blowing a raspberry]]. It can also be wagged in a manner suggesting [[cunnilingus]] which is usually seen as highly vulgar.

===Turkey face===
The turkey face gesture is when you take your hand and put your thumb on your nose, wriggle your head back and forth and do the same thing with the hand. Cocking a snook is an old British taunting gesture in which the thumb of one hand is on the nose and the extended fingers are wiggled.

===V sign===
{{Main|V sign}}
The insulting version of the gesture (with the palm inwards) is often compared to the offensive gesture known as "[[the finger]]". The "two-fingered salute", as it is also known, is commonly performed by flicking the V upwards from wrist or elbow. The V sign, when the palm is facing toward the person giving the sign, has long been an insulting gesture in England,&lt;ref name=BSC-HV&gt;Staff [http://www.britishshakespearecompany.com/synopsis.html Henry V] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607024254/http://www.britishshakespearecompany.com/synopsis.html |date=2008-06-07 }}, [[British Shakespeare Company]], accessed 23 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and later in the rest of the [[United Kingdom]]; its use is largely restricted to the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;V sign as an insult:&lt;!--references for countries listed--&gt;

===Wanker===
{{Main|Wanker}}
[[Image:Fingers and thumb in circle downward motion.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Wanker gesture]]
The wanker gesture is made with a loose fist (with all fingers forming a cylindrical shape), and shaken up and down (or sometimes, back and forth) at the wrist, suggesting [[masturbation]].
A picture of the young [[Tony Blair]], later the [[British Prime Minister]] (1997–2007), using the wanker gesture became widely available (although copyrighted) in 2007.

==In popular culture==
In [[Monty Python]]'s [[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]] the French Knight taunts [[King Arthur]] and his companions with a series of increasingly ludicrous insults, culminating in "Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries".

Versions of the Endemol quiz show [[1 vs. 100]] based on the United States version (Australia, and to an extent, France) are known for the contestants and mob taunting each other.

Similar game shows, such as [[The Weakest Link (UK game show)|Weakest Link]], are built on taunting a defeated player.

===Video games===
Some [[video game]]s feature the ability to taunt an opponent.  In the context of role-playing games, a "taunt" command is often used by the [[Tank (gaming)|tank]] to draw the [[Hate (video gaming)|AI opponents' attention]] to the player's character, saving other more fragile characters from its attacks so that they can perform specialized roles.  In a first-person shooter context or 1 vs 1 games, a "taunt" command is essentially a virtual incarnation of a verbal taunt, and may include either purpose-programmed sounds and gestures or a [[trash talking|symbolic]] ritual insult that players have adopted to show dominance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alwaysblack.com/blackbox/bownigger.html Bow, Nigger] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106223155/http://www.alwaysblack.com/blackbox/bownigger.html |date=2008-11-06 }} - an essay on gaming culture&lt;/ref&gt;  In the context of [[professional wrestling|wrestling]] or [[fighting game]]s, a taunt may serve the purpose of building energy or stamina.

In games not featuring a dedicated "taunt" command, players have devised other ways, within the controls of the game, to taunt or harass opponents of other skill levels.  In a racing game, for example, a player far in the lead might come to a stop before the finish line to watch their competitors begin to catch up, only to accelerate again and take the checkered flag when the opponents draw near. Multiplayer [[first-person shooter|FPS]] games have given rise to the practice of [[teabagging#In video games|corpse humping]] or [[teabagging#In video games|tea bagging]], which involves the "crouch" command present in a typical FPS's control scheme. In FPS games which allow hand-to-hand attacks, another common way of taunting opponents is to kill an opponent while one is not armed with a gun, through the use of some sort of melee attack such as a punch or knifing; ''[[Quake III Arena]]'' makes this form of "taunting" explicit by having the announcer loudly call out "Humiliation!" whenever a player is killed by another player's gauntlet.

In the online PC game sensation ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', the classes of Warrior and Druid have the ability named "Taunt" and "Growl" respectively and used to focus the attack of an enemy non playing character (NPC) onto the Warrior or Druid who have used this ability. These classes also have an ability which focuses the attacks of all creatures in an area, commonly referred to as Area of Effect taunt (AOE). The Warrior ability is called "Challenging shout" and the Druid ability is called "Challenging roar". The Paladin and Death Knight classes possess taunts as well. Taunting isn't limited to game skills; it exists also as an emote (by typing /taunt in the game's chat feature).  This variant of taunting has also been featured in [[turn-based]] RPGs, such as ''[[Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes]]'', in which tank characters can taunt to force all enemies to attack him/her, while having the health and/or defense to withstand all of such attacks so that allies can avoid every attack except [[area of effect]] ones for a limited number of turns.

In the [[Super Smash Bros. series|''Super Smash Bros.'' series]], characters have a brief taunt that can be performed by pressing a button. [[Luigi]]'s is the only taunt that damages the foe, except in Super Smash Bros Brawl, where [[Solid Snake]] also possesses a damaging taunt. [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]]'s taunt removes his current ''disguise''.  In ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'', characters feature 3 different taunts each. If a Down Taunt is executed very quickly, [[Star Fox (series)|Star Fox]] characters and Solid Snake can contact allies on their home stages (known as a Smash Taunt), while [[Samus Aran]] can remove her power suit if the Up and Down taunts are repeated very quickly.

In the online game [[Team Fortress 2]], each character possesses a unique taunt depending on the weapon he is holding, an example of which is when the Demoman lifts his crotch armor to reveal a piece of paper with a smiley-face on it, shouting "Ka-BOOM!" Some taunts can kill opponents, and two can restore health. There are also special taunts, including some that require a partner to execute, that can be obtained as items.

In the ''[[Saints Row (series)|Saints Row]]'' games, players can design their own character and choose from numerous taunts in order to make his/her enemies or pedestrians feel bad, thus engaging in a fist fight. This feature is also available in the second game, now that the character has the ability to speak in which he/she can trash-talk his/her pedestrians and enemy gangs nearby. Performing taunts will earn the player respect.

In ''[[MotorStorm]]'' game, drivers can perform taunts to other drivers in order to humiliate them. These can be performed by any vehicle the player derives, but so do other rivals. In ''[[MotorStorm: Pacific Rift]]'', the use of taunt has been expanded upon and these are done by performing the infamous "the finger" next to another driver. Other taunts can be performed; however, doing this can make the rival attack the player, thus causing the player to crash.

In some [[Pokémon (video game series)|Pokémon]] video games, there is a Dark-type move called Taunt. Once it has been used, it only allows the other player to use moves that can inflict damage, instead of using moves that affect stats, status, weather, etc.

In [[The Secret of Monkey Island]], the main character learns taunts and retorts in a process called insult sword fighting. The learned retorts are used to counter a second set of taunts later. The sequels feature several similar insult games.

In [[Heroes of Newerth]], users who pre-purchased before the open beta began, can use the ability "Taunt" to possibly score a "smackdown" announcement. It happens when the taunting player lands the killing blow on the taunted target. However, if the taunted target kills the taunter, "HUMILIATION" announcement is displayed.

In [[Mirror's Edge]], the main character can pull the V sign, if you execute a certain combination.

In ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto Online]]'' the protagonists can pull the finger to the pedestrians when driving a vehicle while unarmed.

In the [[Dragon Ball]] fighting game [[Dragon Ball: Xenoverse]], '''Taunt''' is a Super Skill used to force enemies to lock-on to the user turning the opponent's attention to the user. When performed the user places their hands on the sides of their hand and make faces while dancing from side-to-side.

'''Type inference''' refers to the automatic detection of the [[data type]] of an expression in a [[programming language]].

It is a feature present in some [[strongly-typed programming language|strongly]] [[Type system#Static typing|statically typed]] languages. It is often characteristic of [[functional programming language]]s in general. Some languages that include type inference include [[C++11]], [[C Sharp 3.0#Local variable type inference|C#]] (starting with version 3.0), [[Chapel (programming language)|Chapel]], [[Clean (programming language)|Clean]], [[Crystal (programming language)|Crystal]], [[D (programming language)|D]], [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]], [[FreeBASIC]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] (starting with version 10), [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]], [[Kotlin (programming language)|Kotlin]], [[ML (programming language)|ML]], [[Nim (programming language)|Nim]], [[OCaml]], [[Opa (programming language)|Opa]], [[RPython]], [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]], [[Vala (programming language)|Vala]] and [[Visual Basic .NET#2008 (VB 9.0)|Visual Basic]] (starting with version 9.0). 
The majority of them use a simple form of type inference, while especially those ones who use the [[Hindley–Milner_type_system|Hindley-Milner type system]] provide a more complete type inference. The ability to infer types automatically makes many programming tasks easier, leaving the programmer free to omit [[type signature|type annotations]] while still permitting type checking.

==Nontechnical explanation==
{{unreferenced|section|date=September 2018}}
In some programming languages, all values have a [[data type]] explicitly declared at [[compile time]], limiting the values a particular expression can take on at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]]. Increasingly, [[just-in-time compilation]] renders the distinction between run time and compile time moot. However, historically, if the type of a value is known only at run-time, these languages are [[dynamically typed]]. In other languages, the type of an expression is known only at [[compile time]]; these languages are [[statically typed]]. In most statically typed languages, the input and output types of functions and [[local variable]]s ordinarily must be explicitly provided by type annotations. For example, in [[C (programming language)|C]]:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int addone(int x) {
    int result; /* declare integer result */

    result = x + 1;
    return result;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
The [[Type signature|signature]] of this function definition, &lt;code&gt;int addone(int x)&lt;/code&gt;, declares that &lt;code&gt;addone&lt;/code&gt; is a function that takes one argument, an [[integer (computer science)|integer]], and returns an integer. &lt;code&gt;int result;&lt;/code&gt; declares that the local variable &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt; is an integer. In a hypothetical language supporting type inference, the code might be written like this instead:
&lt;source lang="javascript"&gt; addone(x) {
     var result;  /* inferred-type variable result */
     var result2; /* inferred-type variable result #2 */

     result = x + 1;
     result2 = x + 1.0;  /* this line won't work (in the proposed language) */
     return result;
 }&lt;/source&gt;
This is identical to how code is written in the language [[Dart (programming language)|Dart]], except that it is subject to some added constraints as described below.  It would be possible to ''infer'' the types of all the variables at compile time. In the example above, the compiler would infer that &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; have type integer since the constant &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; is type integer, and hence that &lt;code&gt;addone&lt;/code&gt; is a function &lt;code&gt;int -&gt; int&lt;/code&gt;. The variable &lt;code&gt;result2&lt;/code&gt; isn't used in a legal manner, so it wouldn't have a type.

In the imaginary language in which the last example is written, the compiler would assume that, in the absence of information to the contrary, &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; takes two integers and returns one integer. (This is how it works in, for example, [[OCaml]].) From this, the type inferencer can infer that the type of &lt;code&gt;x + 1&lt;/code&gt; is an integer, which means &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt; is an integer and thus the return value of &lt;code&gt;addone&lt;/code&gt; is an integer. Similarly, since &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; requires both of its arguments be of the same type&lt;!--integers--&gt;, &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; must be an integer, and thus, &lt;code&gt;addone&lt;/code&gt; accepts one integer as an argument.

However, in the subsequent line, ''result2'' is calculated by adding a decimal &lt;code&gt;1.0&lt;/code&gt; with floating-point arithmetic, causing a conflict in the use of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; for both integer and floating-point expressions. The correct type-inference algorithm for such a situation has been known [[#Hindley–Milner type inference algorithm|since 1958]] and has been known to be correct since 1982. It revisits the prior inferences and uses the most general type from the outset: in this case floating-point. This can however have detrimental implications, for instance using a floating-point from the outset can introduce precision issues that would have not been there with an integer type.

Frequently, however, degenerate type-inference algorithms are used that cannot backtrack and instead generate an error message in such a situation. This behavior may be preferable as type inference may not always be neutral algorithmically, as illustrated by the prior floating-point precision issue.

An algorithm of intermediate generality implicitly declares ''result2'' as a floating-point variable, and the addition implicitly converts &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to a floating point. This can be correct if the calling contexts never supply a floating point argument. Such a situation shows the difference between ''type inference'', which does not involve [[type conversion]], and [[implicit type conversion]], which forces data to a different data type, often without restrictions.

Finally, a significant downside of complex type-inference algorithm is that the resulting type inference resolution is not going to be obvious to humans (notably because of the backtracking), which can be detrimental as code is primarily intended to be comprehensible to humans.

The recent emergence of [[just-in-time compilation]] allows for hybrid approaches where the type of arguments supplied by the various calling context is known at compile time, and can generate a large number of compiled versions of the same function. Each compiled version can then be optimized for a different set of types. For instance, JIT compilation allows there to be at least two compiled versions of ''addone'':

:A version that accepts an integer input and uses implicit type conversion.
:A version that accepts a floating-point number as input and uses floating point instructions throughout.

==Technical description==
Type inference is the ability to automatically deduce, either partially or fully, the type of an expression at compile time. The compiler is often able to infer the type of a variable or the [[type signature]] of a function, without explicit type annotations having been given. In many cases, it is possible to omit type annotations from a program completely if the type inference system is robust enough, or the program or language is simple enough.

To obtain the information required to infer the type of an expression, the compiler either gathers this information as an aggregate and subsequent reduction of the type annotations given for its subexpressions, or through an implicit understanding of the type of various atomic values (e.g. true : Bool; 42 : Integer; 3.14159 : Real; etc.). It is through recognition of the eventual reduction of expressions to implicitly typed atomic values that the compiler for a type inferring language is able to compile a program completely without type annotations.

In complex forms of [[higher-order programming]] and [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]], it is not always possible for the compiler to infer as much, and type annotations are occasionally necessary for disambiguation. For instance, type inference with [[polymorphic recursion]] is known to be undecidable. Furthermore, explicit type annotations can be used to optimize code by forcing the compiler to use a more specific (faster/smaller) type than it had inferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bryan O'Sullivan |author2=Don Stewart |author3=John Goerzen |year=2008 |title=Real World Haskell |chapter=Chapter 25. Profiling and optimization |publisher=O'Reilly |url=http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/profiling-and-optimization.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relative to [[program analysis]], type inference is a special case of [[points-to analysis]] that uses a type abstraction on pointer targets.

==Example==
As an example, the [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] function &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; applies a function to each element of a list, and may be defined as:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 map f [] = []
 map f (first:rest) = f first : map f rest
&lt;/source&gt;

Type inference on the &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; function proceeds as follows. &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; is a function of two arguments, so its type is constrained to be of the form &lt;code&gt;a → b → c&lt;/code&gt;. In Haskell, the patterns &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(first:rest)&lt;/code&gt; always match lists, so the second argument must be a list type: &lt;code&gt;b = [d]&lt;/code&gt; for some type &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;. Its first argument &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is [[function application|applied]] to the argument &lt;code&gt;first&lt;/code&gt;, which must have type &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;, corresponding with the type in the list argument, so &lt;code&gt;f :: d → e&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt; means "is of type") for some type &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;. The return value of &lt;code&gt;map f&lt;/code&gt;, finally, is a list of whatever &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; produces, so &lt;code&gt;[e]&lt;/code&gt;.

Putting the parts together leads to &lt;code&gt;map :: (d → e) → [d] → [e]&lt;/code&gt;. Nothing is special about the type variables, so it can be relabeled as
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 map :: (a → b) → [a] → [b]
&lt;/source&gt;

It turns out that this is also the most general type, since no further constraints apply. As the inferred type of &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; is [[parametric polymorphism|parametrically polymorphic]], the type of the arguments and results of &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; are not inferred, but left as type variables, and so &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; can be applied to functions and lists of various types, as long as the actual types match in each invocation.

=={{anchor|algorithm}}Hindley–Milner type inference algorithm==
{{Main|Hindley–Milner type system}}
The algorithm first used to perform type inference is now informally termed the Hindley–Milner algorithm, although the algorithm should properly be attributed to Damas and Milner.&lt;ref name="Damas-and-Milner-1982"&gt;{{Citation
 |last1= Damas |first1= Luis

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of this algorithm is the type inference algorithm for the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] that was devised by [[Haskell Curry]] and [[Robert Feys]] in 1958.
In 1969 [[J. Roger Hindley]] extended this work and proved that their algorithm always inferred the most general type.
In 1978 [[Robin Milner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; independently of Hindley's work, provided an equivalent algorithm, [[Algorithm W]].
In 1982 [[Luis Damas]]&lt;ref name="Damas-and-Milner-1982" /&gt; finally proved that Milner's algorithm is complete and extended it to support systems with polymorphic references.

==Side-effects of using the most general type==
By design, type inference, especially correct (backtracking) type inference will introduce use of the most general type appropriate, however this can have implications as more general types may not always be algorithmically neutral, the typical cases being:
* floating-point being considered as a general type of integer, while floating-point will introduce precision issues
* variant/dynamic types being considered as a general type of other types, which will introduce casting rules and comparison that could be different, for instance such types use the '+' operator for both numeric additions and string concatenations, but what operation is performed is determined dynamically rather than statically

A '''vocabulary''' is a set of familiar [[words]] within a person's [[language]]. A vocabulary, usually developed with age, serves as a useful and fundamental tool for [[communication]] and [[learning|acquiring knowledge]]. Acquiring an extensive vocabulary is one of the largest challenges in learning a [[second language]].

Vocabulary is commonly defined as "all the words known and used by a particular person".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=88554&amp;dict=CALD Cambridge Advanced Learners Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Knowing'' a word, however, is not as simple as merely being able to recognize or use it. There are several aspects of word knowledge that are used to measure word knowledge.

=== Productive and receptive knowledge ===

The first major distinction that must be made when evaluating word knowledge is whether the knowledge is productive (also called achieve) or receptive (also called receive); even within those opposing categories, there is often no clear distinction. Words that are generally understood when heard or read or seen constitute a person's receptive vocabulary. These words may range from well-known to barely known (see [[Vocabulary#Degree of knowledge|degree of knowledge]] below). A person's receptive vocabulary is the larger of the two. For example, although a young child may not yet be able to speak, write, or sign, he or she may be able to follow simple commands and appear to understand a good portion of the language to which they are exposed. In this case, the child's receptive vocabulary is likely tens, if not hundreds of words, but his or her active vocabulary is zero. When that child learns to speak or sign, however, the child's active vocabulary begins to increase. It is also possible for the productive vocabulary to be larger than the receptive vocabulary, for example in a second-language learner who has learned words through study rather than exposure, and can produce them, but has difficulty recognizing them in conversation.

Productive vocabulary, therefore, generally refers to words that can be produced within an appropriate context and match the intended meaning of the speaker or signer. As with receptive vocabulary, however, there are many degrees at which a particular word may be considered part of an active vocabulary. Knowing how to pronounce, sign, or write a word does not necessarily mean that the word that has been used correctly or accurately reflects the intended message; but it does reflect a minimal amount of productive knowledge.

=== Degree of knowledge ===
Within the receptive–productive distinction lies a range of abilities that are often referred to as ''degree of knowledge''. This simply indicates that a word gradually enters a person's vocabulary over a period of time as more aspects of word knowledge are learnt. Roughly, these stages could be described as:

# Never encountered the word.
# Heard the word, but cannot define it.
# Recognize the word due to context or tone of voice.
# Able to use the word and understand the general and/or intended meaning, but cannot clearly explain it.
# Fluent with the word – its use and definition.

=== Depth of knowledge ===

The differing degrees of word knowledge imply a greater ''depth of knowledge'', but the process is more complex than that. There are many facets to knowing a word, some of which are not hierarchical so their acquisition does not necessarily follow a linear progression suggested by ''degree of knowledge''. Several frameworks of word knowledge have been proposed to better operationalise this concept. One such framework includes nine facets:

# [[orthography]] – written form
# [[phonology]] – spoken form
# [[Referent|reference]] – meaning
# [[semantics]] – concept and reference
# [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] – appropriacy of use or cash register
# [[collocation]] – lexical neighbours
# [[word association]]s
# [[syntax]] – grammatical function
# [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] – word parts

=== Definition of word ===
Words can be defined in various ways, and estimates of vocabulary size differ depending on the definition used. The most common definition is that of a lemma (the uninflected or dictionary form; this includes ''walk'', but not ''walks, walked or walking''). Most of the time lemmas do not include proper nouns (names of people, places, companies, etc). Another definition often used in research of vocabulary size is that of word family. These are all the words that can be derived from a ground word (e.g., the words ''effortless, effortlessly, effortful, effortfully'' are all part of the word family ''effort''). Estimates of vocabulary size range from as high as 200 thousand to as low as 10 thousand, depending on the definition used. &lt;ref&gt;Brysbaert M, Stevens M, Mandera P and Keuleers E (2016) How Many Words Do We Know? Practical Estimates of Vocabulary Size Dependent on Word Definition, the Degree of Language Input and the Participant’s Age. Front.

=== Reading vocabulary ===

A literate person's vocabulary is all the words they can recognize when reading. This is generally the largest type of vocabulary simply because a reader tends to be exposed to more words by reading than by listening.

=== Listening vocabulary ===

A person's [[listening]] vocabulary is all the words they can recognize when listening to speech. People may still understand words they were not exposed to before using cues such as tone, gestures, the topic of discussion and the social context of the conversation.

=== Speaking vocabulary ===

A person's speaking vocabulary is all the words they use in [[speech]]. It is likely to be a subset of the listening vocabulary. Due to the spontaneous nature of speech, words are often misused. This misuse, though slight and unintentional, may be compensated by facial expressions and tone of voice.

=== Writing vocabulary ===

Words are used in various forms of writing from formal essays to social media feeds. Many written words do not commonly appear in speech. Writers generally use a limited set of words when communicating.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} For example, if there are a number of synonyms, a writer may have a preference as to which of them to use, and they are unlikely to use technical vocabulary relating to a subject in which they have no knowledge or interest.

== Focal vocabulary ==

Focal vocabulary is a specialized set of terms and distinctions that is particularly important to a certain group: those with a particular focus of experience or activity. A lexicon, or vocabulary, is a language's dictionary: its set of names for things, events, and ideas. Some linguists believe that lexicon influences people's perception of things, the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]]. For example, the [[Nuer people|Nuer]] of Sudan have an elaborate vocabulary to describe cattle. The Nuer have dozens of names for cattle because of the cattle's particular histories, economies, and environments{{Clarify|date=March 2013}}. This kind of comparison has elicited some linguistic controversy, as with the number of "[[Eskimo words for snow]]". English speakers with relevant specialised knowledge can also display elaborate and precise vocabularies for snow and cattle when the need arises.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lenkeit&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vocabulary growth ==
{{main|Vocabulary development}}
During its infancy, a child instinctively builds a vocabulary. [[Infant]]s imitate words that they hear and then associate those words with objects and actions. This is the [[Vocabulary#Listening vocabulary|listening vocabulary]]. The [[Vocabulary#Speaking vocabulary|speaking vocabulary]] follows, as a child's thoughts become more reliant on his/her ability to self-express without relying on gestures or babbling. Once the [[Vocabulary#Reading vocabulary|reading]] and [[Vocabulary#Writing vocabulary|writing vocabularies]] start to develop, through questions and [[education]], the child starts to discover the anomalies and irregularities of language.

In [[first grade]], a child who can read learns about twice as many words as one who cannot. Generally, this gap does not narrow later. This results in a wide range of vocabulary by age five or six, when an English-speaking child will have learned about 1500 words.&lt;ref&gt;"Vocabulary". Sebastian Wren, Ph.D. BalancedReading.com http://www.balancedreading.com/vocabulary.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Vocabulary grows throughout our entire life. Between the ages of 20 and 60, people learn some 6,000 more lemmas, or one every other day.&lt;ref name="HowMany2016" /&gt; An average 20-year-old knows 42,000 words coming from 11,100 word families; an average 60-year-old knows 48,200 lemmas coming from 13,400 word families.&lt;ref name="HowMany2016" /&gt; People expand their vocabularies by e.g. reading, playing [[word game]]s, and participating in vocabulary-related programs. Exposure to traditional print media teaches correct spelling and vocabulary, while exposure to text messaging leads to more relaxed word acceptability constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |type= M. A. |title=What does txting do 2 language: The influences of exposure to messaging and print media on acceptability constraints |url=http://dspace.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/48490/1/2011_Lee_MA.pdf |author=Joan H.

== Vocabulary size ==

=== Native-language vocabulary ===
Estimating average vocabulary size poses various difficulties and limitations due to the different definitions and methods employed such as what is the word, what is to know a word, what sample dictionaries were used, how tests were conducted, and so on.&lt;ref name="HowMany2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GouldenNationRead1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="D'AnnaZechmeisterHall1991" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nation|first1=I.

As a result estimates vary from as little as 10,000 to as many as over 50,000 for young adult native speakers of English.&lt;ref name="HowMany2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GouldenNationRead1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goulden|first1=Robin|last2=Nation|first2=Paul|last3=Read|first3=John|title=How Large Can a Receptive Vocabulary Be?|journal=Applied Linguistics|date=1 December 1990|volume=11|issue=4|pages=341–363|doi=10.1093/applin/11.4.341|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/about/staff/publications/paul-nation/1990-Goulden-Voc-size.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="D'AnnaZechmeisterHall1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=D'Anna|first1=Catherine|last2=Zechmeister|first2=Eugene|last3=Hall|first3=James|title=Toward a meaningful definition of vocabulary size|journal=Journal of Literacy Research|date=1 March 1991|volume=23|issue=1|pages=109–122|doi=10.1080/10862969109547729|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10862969109547729}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milton|first1=James|last2=Treffers-Daller|first2=Jeanine|title=Vocabulary size revisited: the link between vocabulary size and academic achievement|journal=Applied Linguistics Review|date=29 January 2013|volume=4|issue=1|pages=151-172|doi=10.1515/applirev-2013-0007|url=http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/29879/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One most recent 2016 study shows that 20-year-old English native speakers recognize on average 42,000 [[Lemma (morphology)|lemmas]], ranging from 27,100 for the lowest 5% of the population to 51,700 lemmas for the highest 5%. These lemmas come from 6,100 word families in the lowest 5% of the population and 14,900 word families in the highest 5%. 60-year-olds know on average 6,000 lemmas more.
&lt;ref name="HowMany2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brysbaert|first1=Marc|last2=Stevens|first2=Michaël|last3=Mandera|first3=Paweł|last4=Keuleers|first4=Emmanuel|title=How Many Words Do We Know?

According to another, earlier 1995 study junior-high students would be able to recognize the meanings of about 10,000–12,000 words, whereas for college students this number grows up to about 12,000–17,000 and for elderly adults up to about 17,000 or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zechmeister|first1=Eugene|last2=Chronis|first2=Andrea|last3=Cull|first3=William|last4=D'Anna|first4=Catherine|last5=Healy|first5=Noreen|title=Growth of a functionally important lexicon|journal=Journal of Literacy Research|date=1 June 1995|volume=27|issue=2|pages=201–212|doi=10.1080/10862969509547878|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10862969509547878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For native speakers of German average absolute vocabulary sizes range from 5,900 lemmas in first grade to 73,000 for adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Segbers|first1=J.|last2=Schroeder|first2=S.|title=How many words do children know?

=== Foreign-language vocabulary ===

==== The effects of vocabulary size on language comprehension ====
The knowledge of the 3000 most frequent English word families or the 5000 most frequent words provides 95% vocabulary coverage of spoken discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adolphs|first1=Svenja|last2=Schmitt|first2=Norbert|title=Lexical Coverage of Spoken Discourse|journal=Applied Linguistics|date=2003|volume=24|issue=4|pages=425-438|url=https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/applij/24/4/10.1093/applin/24.4.425/2/240425.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For minimal reading comprehension a threshold of 3,000 [[Word family|word families]] (5,000 lexical items) was suggested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laufer|first1=Batia|editor1-last=Bejoint|editor1-first=H.|editor2-last=Arnaud|editor2-first=P.|title=Vocabulary and Applied Linguistics|date=1992|publisher=Macmillan|pages=126-132|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259810338_How_Much_Lexis_is_Necessary_for_Reading_Comprehension|chapter=How Much Lexis is Necessary for Reading Comprehension?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LauferRavenhorst-Kalovski2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laufer|first1=Batia|last2=Ravenhorst-Kalovski|first2=Geke C.|title=Lexical threshold revisited: Lexical text coverage, learners’ vocabulary size and reading comprehension|journal=Reading in a Foreign Language|date=April 2010|volume=22|issue=1|pages=15–30|url=http://nflrc.hawaii.edu/rfl/April2010/articles/laufer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for reading for pleasure 5,000 word families (8,000 lexical items) are required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hirsh|first1=D.|last2=Nation|first2=I.S.P.|title=What vocabulary size is needed to read unsimplified texts for pleasure?|journal=Reading in a Foreign Language|date=1992|volume=8|issue=2|pages=689-696|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/about/staff/publications/paul-nation/1992-Hirsh-Vocabulary-reading.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An "optimal" threshold of 8,000 word families yields the coverage of 98% (including proper nouns).&lt;ref name="LauferRavenhorst-Kalovski2010" /&gt;

==== Second language vocabulary acquisition ====
Learning vocabulary is one of the first steps in learning a second language, but a learner never finishes vocabulary acquisition. Whether in one's native language or a second language, the acquisition of new vocabulary is an ongoing process. There are many techniques that help one acquire new vocabulary.

==== Memorization ====
Although memorization can be seen as tedious or boring, associating one word in the native language with the corresponding word in the second language until memorized is considered one of the best methods of vocabulary acquisition. By the time students reach adulthood, they generally have gathered a number of personalized memorization methods. Although many argue that memorization does not typically require the complex cognitive processing that increases retention (Sagarra and Alba, 2006),&lt;ref name="Spanish p. 228-243"&gt;Sagarra, Nuria and Alba, Matthew. (2006). "The Key Is in the Keyword: L2 Vocabulary Learning Methods With Beginning Learners of Spanish". ''The Modern Language Journal'', 90, ii. pp. 228–243.&lt;/ref&gt; it does typically require a large amount of repetition, and [[spaced repetition]] with [[flashcard]]s is an established method for memorization, particularly used for vocabulary acquisition in [[computer-assisted language learning]]. Other methods typically require more time and longer to recall.

Some words cannot be easily linked through association or other methods. When a word in the second language is phonologically or visually similar to a word in the native language, one often assumes they also share [[semantic similarity|similar meanings]]. Though this is frequently the case, it is not always true. When faced with a [[false friend]], memorization and repetition are the keys to mastery. If a second language learner relies solely on word associations to learn new vocabulary, that person will have a very difficult time mastering false friends. When large amounts of vocabulary must be acquired in a limited amount of time, when the learner needs to recall information quickly, when words represent abstract concepts or are difficult to picture in a mental image, or when discriminating between false friends, rote memorization is the method to use. A neural network model of novel word learning across orthographies, accounting for L1-specific memorization abilities of L2-learners has recently been introduced (Hadzibeganovic and Cannas, 2009).&lt;ref name="novel word learning"&gt;Hadzibeganovic Tarik and Cannas, Sergio A. (2009). "A Tsallis' statistics-based neural network model for novel word learning". ''Physica A'', 388, pp. 732–746.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Keyword Method ====
One useful method of building vocabulary in a second language is the keyword method. If time is available or one wants to emphasize a few key words, one can create mnemonic devices or word associations. Although these strategies tend to take longer to implement and may take longer in recollection, they create new or unusual connections that can increase retention. The keyword method requires deeper cognitive processing, thus increasing the likelihood of retention (Sagarra and Alba, 2006).&lt;ref name="Spanish p. 228-243"/&gt; This method uses fits within Paivio's (1986)&lt;ref&gt;Paivio, A. (1986). ''Mental Representations: A Dual Coding Approach''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; dual coding theory because it uses both verbal and image memory systems. However, this method is best for words that represent concrete and imageable things. Abstract concepts or words that do not bring a distinct image to mind are difficult to associate. In addition, studies have shown that associative vocabulary learning is more successful with younger students (Sagarra and Alba, 2006).&lt;ref name="Spanish p. 228-243"/&gt; Older students tend to rely less on creating word associations to remember vocabulary.

=== Word lists ===

Several word lists have been developed to provide people with a limited vocabulary either for the purpose of rapid language proficiency or for effective communication. These include [[Basic English]] (850 words), [[Special English]] (1,500 words), [[General Service List]] (2,000 words), and [[Academic Word List]]. Some [[Advanced learner's dictionary|learner's dictionaries]] have developed [[Defining vocabulary|defining vocabularies]] which contain only most common and basic words. As a result word definitions in such dictionaries can be understood even by learners with a limited vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bogaards|first1=Paul|title=The evolution of learners’ dictionaries and ''Merriam-Webster’s Advanced Learner’s English Dictionary''|journal=Kernerman Dictionary News|date=July 2010|issue=18|pages=6-15|url=http://kdictionaries.com/kdn/kdn18.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/about/oxford3000 Oxford 3000]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/learn/clear-definitions.html The Macmillan Defining Vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt; Some publishers produce dictionaries based on word frequency&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.routledge.com/Routledge-Frequency-Dictionaries/book-series/RFD Routledge Frequency Dictionaries]&lt;/ref&gt; or thematic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{icon de}} [http://www.langenscheidt.de/Langenscheidt-Grundwortschatz Langenscheidt Grundwortschatz]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{icon de}} [http://www.langenscheidt.de/Langenscheidt-Grund-und-Aufbauwortschatz Langenscheidt Grund- und Aufbauwortschatz]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{icon de}} [https://shop.hueber.de/de/catalogsearch/result/?q=Grundwortschatz Hueber Grundwortschatz]&lt;/ref&gt;
