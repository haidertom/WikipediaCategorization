{{accounting}}'''Accounting rate of return''', also known as the '''Average rate of return''', or '''ARR''' is a [[financial ratio]] used in [[capital budgeting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/accounting-rate-of-return-arr Accounting Rate of Return - ARR]&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio does not take into account the concept of [[time value of money]]. ARR calculates the [[Rate of return|return]], generated from [[net income]] of the proposed capital [[investment]]. The ARR is a percentage return. Say, if ARR = 7%, then it means that the project is expected to earn seven cents out of each dollar invested (yearly). If the ARR is equal to or greater than the required rate of return, the project is acceptable. If it is less than the desired rate, it should be rejected. When comparing investments, the higher the ARR, the more attractive the investment. More than half of large firms calculate ARR when appraising projects.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, G. (2007). Essentials of corporate financial management. London: Pearson Education, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

The key advantage of ARR is that it is easy to compute and understand. The main disadvantage of ARR is that it disregards the time factor in terms of [[time value of money]] or [[Risk management|risks]] for long term investments. The ARR is built on evaluation of profits and it can be easily manipulated with changes in [[Depreciation (economics)|depreciation]] methods. The ARR can give misleading information when evaluating investments of different size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tiduko.com/how-to-calculate-accounting-rate-of-return.html|title=How to Calculate Accounting Rate of Return {{!}} Tiduko.com {{!}} Never Stop Learning|website=tiduko.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic formulas==
: &lt;math&gt;\text{ARR} = \frac{\text{Average return during period}}{\text{Average investment}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

: &lt;math&gt;\text{Average investment} = \frac{\text{Book value at beginning of year 1 + Book value at end of useful life}}{\text{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Average return during period} = {\mbox{Incremental revenue} -\mbox{ Incremental expenses (including depreciation)}\over \mbox{Initial investment}}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Average profit} = {\mbox{Profit after tax}\over \mbox{Life of investment}}&lt;/math&gt;

== Pitfalls ==
# This technique is based on profits rather than [[cash flow]]. It ignores cash flow from investment. Therefore, it can be affected by non-cash items such as [[bad debt]]s and [[depreciation]] when calculating profits. The change of methods for depreciation can be manipulated and lead to higher profits.
# This technique does not adjust for the risk to long term forecasts.
# ARR doesn't take into account the [[time value of money]].

'''Anne-Marie Idrac''' (born 27 July 1951 in [[Saint-Brieuc]], Côtes-d'Armor) is a French politician, member of the [[Nouveau Centre]] political party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nouveaucentre.fr/page/le-centre-se-recompose-au-nouveau-centre |title=Le centre se recompose au Nouveau Centre ! |publisher=[[Nouveau Centre]] |accessdate=6 June 2010 |date=8 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was French Minister of State for foreign trade.

== Biography ==
Idrac, an alumna of the [[Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris|Institute of political studies of Paris]] (''Sciences Po''), and of the [[École Nationale d'Administration]], was, from 1974 to 1995, civil administrator in various posts in the [[Minister of Public Works (France)]], of housing, of the environment, of urbanism and of transports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actu-cci.com/?pg=mag_article&amp;id_m_a=2180 |title=Anne-Marie Idrac au Commerce extérieur |publisher=[[Commerce international]] |accessdate=6 June 2010|date=2 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also general director of the public establishment of rural development of [[Cergy-Pontoise]] from 1990 to 1993.

In 1995, still director of land transports, she was called to the government as woman issued from the civil society, to the post of Transportation State Secretary, which she occupied under the two Juppé governments. She conducted the legislative reform of 1996 which led to the debt-clearing of the SNCF by the creation of the RFF, and to the experimentation in 5 regions of de-centralisation of regional trains ([[TER]]), extended in 2001 by Jean-Claude Gayssot.

Daughter of [[André Colin]], the head of MRP and of political parties which succeeded it at the centre, she chose to join [[François Bayrou]]'s Democratic Force and the [[Union for French Democracy]] (UDF). She was elected UDF deputy of the third circonscription of the Yvelines in 1997 and re-elected in 2002, losing to Hervé Morin to the presidency of the group UDF at the National Assembly. She was chairman of the regional council of the Île-de-France (1998–2002) and was general secretary to the 'Nouvelle Union' for the French Democracy (UDF).

In September 2002, she left her mandate and political functions to take on the presidency of the RATP, on the suggestion of Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]]. Christian Blanc, ally to the UDF, who had been one of her predecessors at the RATP, and with whom she has led the fusion of Air-France/Air-Inter to completion, became her successor at the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]]. Her mandate years at the [[Régie Autonome des Transports Parisiens|RATP]] are marked most notably by the reform of retirement financing, the launching of automation of Parisian metro's line 1, the installation of a guaranteed contractual service in case of strikes, as well as contracts in foreign countries.

Brought back to the post for a mandate of 5 years in July 2004, she resigned on 12 July 2006 to succeed [[Louis Gallois]] as head of the [[SNCF]], the latter being called to [[EADS]]. She was involved in the development of TGV lines at a European dimension, to the relaunch of regional transportation, and to the regeneration of the network for RFF, and to the rectification of the fret situation. She obtained the creation of an autonomous fund for retired railwaymen, rendered necessary by the application to enterprise of IFRS accounting norms.

The ''' Anuga FoodTec ''' (official subtitle ''International supplier fair for the food and drink industry'') is the world’s leading trade fair for the food and drink industry. It covers all aspects of food production from processing, filling and packaging technology as well as packaging materials and ingredients to food safety and innovations in all areas associated with food production.

It takes place in [[Cologne]] - [[Germany]]  biennially (every 2 years). The organizer is [[Cologne Trade Fair]] (koelnmesse). The non-material sponsor is [[German Agricultural Society]] (Deutsche Landwirtschafts-Gesellschaft e.V. DLG).

Resource efficiency is one of the focal points of Anuga FoodTec. A protective and efficient use of natural resources is considered the key competence of future societies. Exhibitors demonstrate a variety of [[solution]]s{{solution-inline|date=November 2018}} for strengthening competitiveness while reducing the use of energy, water and food in production. The numerous events that make up the framework programme also illuminate this topic from various angles.

== History ==
 
Originating from the former Anuga-Technica and the DLG-FoodTec fairs, Anuga FoodTec has been providing a comprehensive process-oriented overview of all the technologies required for food production, from processing and packaging to distribution, since 1996. &lt;ref&gt;[http://supermarketnews.com/archive/dlg-foodtec-anuga-detail-trade-event-plan DLG FOODTEC, ANUGA DETAIL TRADE EVENT PLAN]&lt;/ref&gt; Its independence from specific industries, raw materials, and sub-processes has made the trade fair one of the leading information and procurement platforms in the global food industry.

In 2012, 42,986 visitors (from 126 countries) came to Anuga FoodTec and could obtain information from 1,289 exhibitors (from 41 countries) on a total surface area of 127,000 square meters. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auma.de/_pages/MesseDetailListe.aspx?id=103807&amp;sprache=e Anuga FoodTec at the official trade database AUMA]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.potatopro.com/Lists/News/DispForm.aspx?ID=5777 Anuga Foodtec 2012 expands exhibition space due to strong demand]&lt;/ref&gt;The trade fair also saw a positive development in 2012 in the number of exhibitors (10%) and visitors (27%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.packworld.com/trends-and-issues/trainingeducation/anuga-foodtec-2015-poised-break-records Anuga FoodTec poised break records at Packaging World]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the trade fair achieved a new exhibitor and visitor record. Up 14 percent from the previous fair, 1,496 exhibitors (from 49 countries) exhibited on a total surface area of 129,700 sqm. With regard to trade visitors, 45,604 experts (from 139 countries) represented an increase of 6 percent. International visitors accounted for more than 50 percent of the total. 

In 2011 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.potatopro.com/news/2011/pack-expo-and-anuga-foodtec-announce-strategic-partnership-processing-and-packaging Pack Expo and Anuga FoodTec announce partnership in potatopro]&lt;/ref&gt; Anuga FoodTec formed a strategic partnership with [[PMMI]], the organizer of [[Pack Expo]] and [[Expo Pack]] which was renewed in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.packagingdigest.com/automation/owners-pack-expo-and-anuga-foodtec-form-strategic-partnership Pack Expo and Anuga FoodTec form strategic partnership in packagingdigest]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016 Koelnmesse and Fiere di Parma founded a Joint-Venture to commonly organize Cibus Tec, the leading Italian foodtechnology fair. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.food-magazine.it/2016/06/koeln-parma-exhibitions-sinergia-per-sviluppo-strategico-di-cibus-tec/ Koelnmesse and Fiere di Parma founded JV for Cibus Tec]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cabin boy ou mousse 1799.jpg|thumb|Cabin boy, 1799]]
A '''cabin boy''' or '''ship's boy''' is a [[boy]] (in the sense of low-ranking young male employee, not always a minor in the juridical sense) who waits on the officers and passengers of a [[ship]],&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Oxford Dictionary'', Oxford University Press 1999, entry "Cabin boy"&lt;/ref&gt; especially running errands for the captain.
==Duties==
Cabin boys were usually 13–16 years old, but sometimes as young as 8,&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.es/books?id=cVcAAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA174&amp;lpg=PA174&amp;dq=%22cabin+boys%22+%22as+young+as%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MC1-9kyYDS&amp;sig=iTwIO4e4lfK8JqdQSpY3FdPes_g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwixmbGyxfDcAhUpLsAKHZ2uDFMQ6AEwDXoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cabin%20boys%22%20%22as%20young%20as%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; and also helped the cook in the [[galley (kitchen)|ship's kitchen]] and carried buckets of food from the ship's kitchen to the [[forecastle]] where the ordinary seamen ate. They would have to run from one end of the ship to the other carrying messages and become familiar with the sails, lines and ropes and the use of each in all sorts of weather. They would have to scramble up the rigging into the yards whenever the sails had to be trimmed. They would occasionally stand watch like other crewmen or act as helmsman in good weather, holding the wheel to keep the ship steady on her course.

'''Compliance Ireland''' was formally established in January 2004, but informally commenced in mid-2003.  It is a [[private company]], but uniquely it writes on, and contributes to, numerous [[debate]]s in [[Ireland]] about [[corporate governance]] and [[compliance (regulation)|compliance]] on an independent basis.  Compliance Ireland is frequently quoted in [[newspaper]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepost.ie/story/eygbaumhey/ |title=The Sunday Business Post |publisher=Thepost.ie |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}} {{Dead link|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribune.ie/article/2009/oct/25/bermudan-must-make-bad-banking-disappear/?q=peter%20oakes ]{{dead link|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; government reports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/CounterFraud/Documents/International_fraud_and_corruption_report.pdf |title=The International Fraud and Corruption Report |format=PDF |date=July 2006 |accessdate=2014-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020021109/http://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/CounterFraud/Documents/International_fraud_and_corruption_report.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2014}} television,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Aoife |last=Kavanagh |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0224/primetime.html |title=Prime Time GAA: Cork Hurling Crisis |publisher=RTÉ Sport |date=2009-02-24 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2014}} radio&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0302/morningireland.html |title=RTÉ News: Morning Ireland |publisher=RTÉ.ie |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221142307/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0302/morningireland.html |archivedate=2014-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Financial Regulator]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Compliance Ireland has been both a measured critic and supporter of the [[Financial Regulator]] and [[Central Bank of Ireland|Central Bank]] since the two entities were loosely joined in 2003 following a wide sweeping regulatory review commenced by [[Michael McDowell (politician)|Michael McDowell]] (former T.D, Minister for Justice and [[Tánaiste]]) in the late 1990s and published in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=1332 |title=Page Redirection |publisher=Finance.gov.ie |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220095847/http://www.finance.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=1332 |archivedate=February 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In early 2009 the Irish Prime Minister or [[Taoiseach]], [[Brian Cowen]], announced the creation of a new unitary [[central bank]] and [[financial services]] regulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0228/fiannafail.html |title=New Central Banking Commission announced |publisher=[[RTÉ News]] |date=2009-03-02 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The proposed new regulator has been referred to by various names since it was announced.  It is expected to be known as the Central Bank of Ireland Commission (CBIC) or similar. The CIBC will replace the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland created in 2003, although it did not receive its enforcement powers until 2004.  The Minister for Finance, [[Brian Lenihan Jnr|Brian Lenihan]], signaled that he would publish a Bill by the end of 2009. As of 31 December 2009 a Bill has yet to be published.

Notwithstanding a lack of a heads of Bill, the Minister has been busy appointing a new Governor ([[Patrick Honohan]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=5922&amp;CatID=1&amp;StartDate=1+January+2009&amp;m= |title=Page Redirection |publisher=Finance.gov.ie |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220095947/http://www.finance.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=5922&amp;CatID=1&amp;StartDate=1%2BJanuary%2B2009&amp;m= |archivedate=February 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Head of Financial Regulation ([[Matthew Elderfield]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=6021&amp;CatID=1&amp;StartDate=1+January+2009&amp;m= |title=Page Redirection |publisher=Finance.gov.ie |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220095954/http://www.finance.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=6021&amp;CatID=1&amp;StartDate=1%2BJanuary%2B2009&amp;m= |archivedate=February 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to spearhead central bank and financial services [[regulatory reform]] in Ireland. Governor Honohan commenced his position in October 2009 (taking over from Juhn Hurley) and Mr Elderfield will join the CBIC in early January 2010.  A number of significant and senior roles reporting into Mr Elderfield were advertised on 18 December 2009, including three Assistant Director-General roles (Enforcement, Policy &amp; Risk and Markets Supervision)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Thomas |last=Molloy |url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/outsiders-to-get-key-regulatory-positions-1971223.html |title=Outsiders to get key regulatory positions |publisher=[[Irish Independent]] |date=2009-12-11 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Registrar of Credit Unions.

'''Delivery''' is the process of transporting goods from a source location to a predefined destination. There are different delivery types. [[Cargo]] (physical goods) are primarily delivered via [[roads]] and [[Rail transport|railroads]] on land, shipping lanes on the sea and [[airline]] networks in the air. Certain specialized goods may be delivered via other networks, such as [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] for liquid goods, [[power grids]] for electrical power and [[computer networks]] such as the [[Internet]] or [[broadcasting|broadcast]] networks for electronic information.&lt;ref name="Nishio Kishino 2003"&gt;{{cite book | last=Nishio | first=S. | last2=Kishino | first2=F. | title=Advanced Multimedia Content Processing: First International Conference, AMCP'98, Osaka, Japan, November 9-11, 1998, Proceedings | publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg | series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science | year=2003 | isbn=978-3-540-48962-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dQdrCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA196 | page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general process of delivering goods is known as [[distribution (business)|distribution]]. The study of effective processes for delivery and disposition of goods and personnel is called [[logistics]]. Firms that specialize in delivering commercial goods from point of production or storage to [[point of sale]] are generally known as distributors, while those that specialize in the delivery of goods to the consumer are known as [[Package delivery|delivery services]]. [[Mail|Postal]], [[courier]], and [[relocation services]] also deliver goods for commercial and private interests.

==Consumer goods delivery==
[[File:Dairy Crest Milk Float Garage 2.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Dairy Crest]] [[Smith Electric Vehicles|Smiths]] Elizabethan electric [[Milk float]] used to deliver fresh milk to people's doorsteps.]]
Most consumer goods are delivered from a point of production ([[factory]] or [[farm]]) through one or more points of storage ([[warehouse]]s) to a point of sale ([[retail store]]), where the consumer buys the good and is responsible for its transportation to point of consumption. There are many variations on this model for specific types of goods and modes of sale. Products sold via catalogue or the Internet may be delivered directly from the manufacturer or warehouse to the consumer's home, or to an [[Packstation|automated delivery booth]]. Small manufacturers may deliver their products directly to retail stores without warehousing.

Some manufacturers maintain [[factory outlet]]s which serve as both warehouse and retail store, selling products directly to consumers at wholesale prices (although many retail stores falsely advertise as factory outlets). Building, construction, landscaping and like materials are generally delivered to the consumer by a contractor as part of another service. Some highly perishable or hazardous goods, such as [[radioisotopes]] used in [[medical imaging]], are delivered directly from manufacturer to consumer.

Home delivery is often available for [[fast food]] and other convenience products, e.g. [[pizza delivery]].&lt;ref name="Haig 2006"&gt;{{cite book | last=Haig | first=M. | title=Brand Royalty: How the World's Top 100 Brands Thrive &amp; Survive | publisher=Kogan Page | series=Kogan Page Series | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-7494-4826-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f4AJ0AU58a4C&amp;pg=PA277 | page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes home delivery of [[supermarket]] goods is possible.&lt;ref name="Hill Jones Schilling 2014"&gt;{{cite book | last=Hill | first=C.W.L. | last2=Jones | first2=G.R. | last3=Schilling | first3=M.A. | title=Strategic Management: Theory &amp; Cases: An Integrated Approach | publisher=Cengage Learning | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-305-14272-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d0PAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=SL3-PA59 | page=3-PA59}}&lt;/ref&gt; A milk float is a small [[battery electric vehicle]] (BEV), specifically designed for the delivery of fresh [[milk]]. A new form of delivery is emerging on the horizon of the internet age: Delivery by the crowd e.g. crowd delivery. In this concept an individual not necessarily contracted by the vendor performs the delivery of goods to the destination. Sometimes, private [[courier]] companies will also deliver [[consumer goods]] on a regular basis for companies like [[E-commerce]] businesses.

==Delivery vehicles==
{{See also|Autonomous car}}
[[File:An ASDA Mercedes Benz Sprinter delivery van.jpg|thumb|right|[[Asda|ASDA]] [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter]] vans for delivering groceries to customers' doors]]
[[File:Worksman delivery trike.jpg|thumb|Delivery tricycle]]
[[File:Commercial. Elmhurst Dairy BAnQ P48S1P07599.jpg|thumb|A horse-drawn dairy delivery vehicle in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada in 1942]]
The consumer demand for Supermarkets to deliver to their door created the need for a mixed temperature controlled vehicle on 3.5T chassis. These vehicle bodies were initially built with the traditional GRP sandwich panels but as more damage resistant lightweight materials with better insulation properties have become available companies have been developing Advanced Home Delivery Vehicles. The 2012 Commercial Vehicle Show in the UK saw the new JDC PolyBilt design, one of the latest of these "Plastic" bodies that can also be recycled at the end of its service life unlike the traditional GRP which ends up as landfill.

Vehicles are often specialized to deliver different types of goods. On land, [[semi-trailer]]s are outfitted with various [[trailer (vehicle)|trailers]] such as box trailers, flatbeds, car carriers, tanks and other specialized trailers, while [[railroad]] [[trains]] include similarly specialized cars. [[Armored car (valuables)|Armored cars]], [[dump truck]]s and [[concrete mixer]]s are examples of vehicles specialized for delivery of specific types of goods. On the sea, [[merchant ships]] come in various forms, such as [[cargo ship]]s, [[oil tankers]] and [[fishing boat]]s. [[Freight aircraft]] are used to deliver cargo.

Often, [[passenger]] vehicles are used for delivery of goods. These include [[buses]], [[van]]s, [[Pickup truck|pick-ups]], [[Automobile|cars]] (e.g., for mail or pizza delivery), [[motorcycles]] and [[bicycles]] (e.g., for newspaper delivery). A significant amount of freight is carried in the cargo holds of passenger ships and aircraft. Everyday travelers, known as a [[casual courier]], can also be used to deliver goods.

Delivery to remote, primitive or inhospitable areas may be accomplished using [[general aviation|small aircraft]], [[snowmobiles]], [[horse-drawn vehicle]]s, [[dog sled]]s, [[pack animal]]s, on foot, or by a variety of other transport methods.

==Periodic deliveries==
Some products are delivered to consumers on a periodic schedule.&lt;ref name="Golden Raghavan Wasil 2008"&gt;{{cite book | last=Golden | first=B.L. | last2=Raghavan | first2=S. | last3=Wasil | first3=E.A. | title=The Vehicle Routing Problem: Latest Advances and New Challenges | publisher=Springer US | series=Operations Research/Computer Science Interfaces Series | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-387-77778-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-3ta5ne3-owC&amp;pg=PA93 | page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, home delivery of many goods was much more common in urban centres of the developed world. At the beginning of the 20th century, perishable farm items such as milk, eggs and ice, were delivered weekly or even daily to customers by local farms. [[Milkmen]] delivered milk and other farm produce. With the advent of home refrigeration and better distribution methods, these products are today largely delivered through the same retail distribution systems as other food products. [[Iceman (occupation)|Icemen]] delivered ice for [[iceboxes]] until the popularization of home refrigerator rendered them obsolete in most places. Similarly, laundry was once picked up and washed at a commercial [[laundry]] before being delivered to middle-class homes until the appearance of the [[washing machine]] and [[Clothes dryer|dryer]] (the lower classes washed their own and the upper classes had live-in servants). Likewise deliveries of coal and wood for home heating were more common until they were replaced in many areas by [[natural gas]], oil, or electric heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rewedmonton.ca/content_view_rew?CONTENT_ID=2786|title=The days of door-to-door delivery|date=11 March 2010|last=Herzog|first=Lawrence|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308202349/http://www.rewedmonton.ca/content_view_rew?CONTENT_ID=2786|archive-date=8 March 2012|work=Edmonton Real Estate Weekly: It's Our Heritage|volume=28|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some products, most notably [[home heating oil]], are still delivered periodically. Human blood may be delivered to hospitals on a periodic schedule.&lt;ref name="Golden Raghavan Wasil 2008"/&gt;

Milk delivery continued until the mid-twentieth century across North America. For example, the last milk delivery by horse-and-wagon in [[Edmonton]] was in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epl.ca/infofile-detail?subject_detail=Milk%20Delivery%20-%20Edmonton|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829062550/http://www.epl.ca/infofile-detail?subject_detail=Milk%20Delivery%20-%20Edmonton|archive-date=29 August 2012|title=Infofile Detail - Milk Delivery - Edmonton| publisher=Edmonton Public Library}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milkman joke]]s continue in circulation long after. Related lines of [[Jeannie C. Riley]]'s 1968 hit song "[[Harper Valley PTA]]" say:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''There's old Bobby Taylor sitting there, and seven times he's asked me for a date,&lt;br /&gt;And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16603">'''Emil Calmanovici''' (March 1896 – March 12, 1956) was a [[Romania]]n engineer, businessman, and [[communism|communist]] militant. Known for the financial support he gave to the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR) during the late 1930s and early 1940s, he became a [[political prisoner]] of the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]] after being implicated in the [[show trial]] of his collaborator [[Lucreţiu Pătrăşcanu]]. Calmanovici died in mysterious circumstances in [[Aiud prison]], while on recovery from a [[hunger strike]].

==Biography==

=== Early life and financial success ===
Born to a [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] family in [[Piatra Neamţ]], he was the son of Mendel and his wife Ana, who ran a business in the town.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"&gt;Betea, "Recunoștința..."&lt;/ref&gt; A graduate of the [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich|University of Munich]] and the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], where he was confronted with the establishment of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]]&lt;ref name="Betea, Procese politice"&gt;Betea, "Procese politice"&lt;/ref&gt; and became an avid reader of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]],&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; he also amassed a fortune in his youth, owing to his [[real estate]] investments.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; Calmanovici decided to dedicate his wealth to the PCR cause, at a time when the party was outlawed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Betea, "Recunoștința...", "Testamentul..."&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of [[World War II]], when they were [[nationalization|nationalized]], his properties included two construction enterprises, additional shares in a [[logging]] company centered in his native town, seven apartments, and over 18,000 m² in [[Bucharest]] real estate.&lt;ref&gt;Betea, "procese politice", "Recunoștința..."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Party financier===
According to Calmanovici's statements, he had contributed massive sums to various PCR enterprises between 1937 (the year when he joined the group) and 1944, being responsible for the purchase of a [[printing press]], the renovation of the [[Central Committee]] seat in Bucharest, a clandestine radio station, and a kindergarten for children of party members.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Calmanovici, in Betea, "Recunoștința..."&lt;/ref&gt; He estimated that his investments totaled 30 million [[Romanian leu|lei]] in 1942 currency, which he argued was over 75% of his total income.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Calmanovici took pride in noting that this contribution was by far the highest of all those recorded (including that of [[Jacques Berman]]).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In addition, he contended, nationalization of his wealth had brought the state over 1 billion lei in 1947 currency.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Inside the PCR, he kept only sporadic contacts with the "prison faction", a group led by [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] (according to one account, during the time when Gheorghiu-Dej was held in [[Doftana prison]], Calmanovici sent him a jacket as a gift).&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; Instead, he was close to Pătrășcanu's maverick group (later known as the "Secretariat faction"), a fact which, in time, contributed to his arrest and imprisonment (both of which were instigated by members of the "prison faction").&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt;

===Late 1940s===
During the war, when Romania joined the [[Axis Powers]] and participated in [[Operation Barbarossa]], he was among those charged with establishing contacts between the Communists and other opposition groups.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; At the time, his relation with the pro-[[Allies of World War II|Allied]] financier Alexandru Ștefănescu helped him gain intimate knowledge of various negotiations between the [[National Peasants' Party]] (PNȚ) and the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL) on one side and [[Ion Antonescu]]'s dictatorial government on the other, as well as of the latter's tentative moves to withdraw Romania from its alliance with [[Nazi Germany]] through a compromise with the Western Allies (the 1943 unsuccessful mission of [[Barbu Ştirbey]] to [[Cairo]]).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Betea, "Recunoștința..."; note to Calmanovici's letter, in ''Sfera Politicii''&lt;/ref&gt; Calmanovici forwarded his information to the PCR's [[Remus Koffler]], which helped the group approach and influence the PNȚ leader [[Iuliu Maniu]] to form an alliance against Antonescu (one which enlisted support from the [[Soviet Union]]).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

After the fall of Antonescu's regime and the onset of [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation]] in August 1944, when the PCR first entered government, Calmanovici became an esteemed party member and officially endorsed industrialist.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; In the spring of 1945, his Bucharest house served as a meeting place for PCR and pro-Communist forces who planned and succeeded in toppling [[List of Prime Ministers of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Nicolae Rădescu]]&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; (after a series of street clashes, Rădescu was replaced with the [[Ploughmen's Front]] leader [[Petru Groza]], whose cabinet was controlled by the PCR). Following this, he was appointed a technical director of the Bucharest Constructions Institute and was involved in enforcing Soviet standards and expertise.&lt;ref&gt;Betea, "Procese politice", "Recunoștința..."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrest===
Relations between Calmanovici and the PCR degenerated abruptly toward the end of the 1940s, and he was arrested by the [[Securitate]] on May 26, 1951.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; Several days earlier, Calmanovici had met with [[Constantin Pîrvulescu]]. At this meeting, Calmanovici asked Pîrvulescu to use his status as head of the Party Control Commission to grant him a decoration (Calmanovici was stiffly refused, on the grounds that such self-promotion was unprecedented).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Documents involving the 1943–1944 contacts between Calmanovici, Pătrășcanu, Koffler, and Maniu (who was already imprisoned on such charges following the [[Tămădău Affair]]) were interpreted as evidence that the former two had been spying for the Western Allies.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; In full, the accusation read: "as an agent of the [[United Kingdom|English]] espionage services he forwarded information about the PCR, taking part in the criminal action to destroy the party and support the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|anti-Soviet war]]".&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;Rendered in Betea, "Recunoștința..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Calmanovici stated that, early on, authorities had presented him with the claim that he was kept in custody in order to aid in the process of compiling a history of the PCR.&lt;ref&gt;Calmanovici, in Betea, "Procese politice", "Recunoștința..."&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in summer 1951, he was subject to a series of Securitate interrogations, which concluded that he had not contributed to hostile activities and that he was able to support his case with "sufficient guarantees".&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;

In December, Calmanovici, who had devoted his spare time to learning [[Russian language|Russian]],&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; was supposed to be released from custody.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; Instead, his case was reviewed by a new group of Securitate officials, who obeyed Gheorghiu-Dej and alleged that the latter's rival, [[List of Romanian Ministers of the Interior|Minister of the Interior]] [[Teohari Georgescu]], was not enforcing party doctrine (Georgescu was to be himself ousted in 1952).&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; On orders from [[Alexandru Drăghici]] and [[Vladimir Mazuru]], under the supervision of several Soviet envoys,&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; Securitate cadres were to induce Calmanovici to confess having spied in Romania during and after the World War.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; The officer who had originally argued in favor of his release was criticized for having displayed "lack of vigilance", and ordered to resume interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;Betea, "Recunoștința..."; Golopenția&lt;/ref&gt;

In several appeals to the PCR leadership (Gheorghiu-Dej, Pîrvulescu, [[Chivu Stoica]], [[Emil Bodnăraş]] and others) Calmanovici repeatedly stated his innocence and dismissed accusations that he was a [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] figure with insufficient political education.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In another personal letter, he compared allegations of espionage with those made by [[Alexander Kerensky]] about [[Vladimir Lenin]] prior to the [[October Revolution]] in [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"&gt;Calmanovici, in ''Sfera Politicii''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confession and trial===
In February 1953, Calmanovici gave in to Securitate violence and presented operatives with a fabricated account, stating that he had been part of a network of spies presided over by Milton (a name he came up with after recalling the 17th-century poet [[John Milton]]).&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; His inquisitors soon rejected the story, and argued that it was additional proof of "provocation" on Calmanovici's part.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;

Eventually, he agreed to sign his name to a confession drawn up by the PCR, in return for a promise that he was to be given at most a four-year sentence.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; It has been argued that the document endorsed by Calmanovici was directly inspired from the similar one handed over by [[Nikolai Bukharin]] during the 1938 [[Moscow]] [[Trial of the Twenty One]].&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; In its final form, it also incriminated Calmanovici of [[Zionism]] and spying in favor of the [[Western Bloc|Western Allies]] (the [[United States]],&lt;ref name="Betea, Procese politice"/&gt; or, alternatively, the [[United Kingdom]]).&lt;ref name="Introduction to Calmgram"&gt;Introduction to Calmgram&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, Calmanovici was indicted in Pătrășcanu's 1954 trial, where, despite early promises, the court ultimately sentenced him to [[life imprisonment]] and [[Penal labour|forced labor]].&lt;ref&gt;Betea, "Recunoștința..."; Levy, p.152; Tismăneanu, p.329&lt;/ref&gt; The sentence was given on counts of [[crime against peace]] and [[high treason]].&lt;ref name="Introduction to Calmgram"/&gt; As Pătrășcanu and Koffler were being swiftly executed in [[Jilava]], he and the other persons sentenced (including Alexandru Ștefănescu, [[Petre Pandrea]], [[Harry Brauner]], [[Lena Constante]], and Pătrășcanu's wife Elena) were dispatched to the infamous [[Aiud prison]], on their way to various facilities.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt;

===Imprisonment and death===
Calmanovici, who was kept in almost complete isolation, managed to contact other inmates, an infraction which was added to his criminal record.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt;

As a consequence, the Securitate decided to stage a set of circumstances which were to incriminate him further: in 1955, Calmanovici was escorted out of Aiud and into a villa in [[Săftica]], where he received a humane treatment while being interrogated by [[Vasile Posteucă]].&lt;ref&gt;Betea, "Recunoștința..."; Calmanovici, in ''Sfera Politicii''&lt;/ref&gt; A guard was instructed to approach him and earn his confidence, to the point where Calmanovici trusted him with carrying out a message he had written on linens; addressed to his former employees and meant to be forwarded to Jewish communists in the [[Western world]], these exposed the fallacies and major irregularities of his trial.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; (In similar appeals, Calmanovici had also meant to bring his case to the attention of the [[Cominform]].)&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt; After the guard handed the letters over to his superiors, Calmanovici was chained and moved back into Aiud.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt;

He decided to publicize his innocence by beginning a [[hunger strike]], which eventually led physicians on duty to [[Force-feeding|force-feed]] him.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; His diet at the time went against medical guidelines for people with [[malnutrition]], and was the most likely cause of his death by [[gastrointestinal perforation]] &amp;mdash; two prison staff members later attested that this was done on purpose, as a method of assassination.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt; It has also been noted that Calmanovici's signed statement according to which he was abandoning the hunger strike and was accepting the treatment, extracted only hours before his death, was immediately communicated to higher authority (unlike any other such statement of the time).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Of his group, Calmanovici was the only one to die in custody (all others were released ca. 1964, when they benefited from an [[amnesty]]).&lt;ref&gt;Levy, p.152&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rehabilitation and legacy==
Like all defendants in the Pătrășcanu trial, Calmanovici was [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] in April 1968 by [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]], following a change in policy which was meant to discredit his deceased predecessor Gheorghiu-Dej and the former Securitate chief [[Alexandru Drăghici]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The new inquiry, overseen by [[Ion Popescu-Puţuri]], found that Calmanovici had been the victim of systematic abuse. Among others, it was established that Calmanovici's arrest had been operated on the basis of Gheorghiu-Dej's personal views, that the charges had for long not been communicated to Calmanovici, that Soviet agents had openly intervened in interrogations, and that, like virtually all other defendants, he had been repeatedly beaten and otherwise [[torture]]d to ensure a [[forced confession]].&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt;

Calmanovici's son became a resident and later a citizen of [[Sweden]], becoming known under the name Gad Calmgran.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Calmgram"/&gt; He worked as a journalist, and was a collaborator for the newspaper ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]''.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Calmgram"/&gt;

'''GB standards''' are the Chinese national standards issued by the [[Standardization Administration of China]] (SAC), the Chinese National Committee of the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] and [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]].  ''GB'' stands for ''Guobiao'' ({{zh|s=国标|t=國標|p=Guóbiāo}}), Chinese for ''national standard''.

Mandatory standards are prefixed "GB". Recommended standards are prefixed "GB/T" (T from [[Chinese language]] 推荐 ''tuījiàn'', "recommended"). A standard number follows "GB" or "GB/T".

GB standards are the basis for the product testing which products must undergo during the [[China Compulsory Certificate]] (CCC) certification. If there is no corresponding GB Standard, CCC is not required.

==List==

A non-exhaustive list of National Standards of the People's Republic of China is listed as follows, accompanied with similar international standards of ISO, marked as identical (IDT), equivalent (EQV), or non-equivalent (NEQ).

== Regulatory changes ==
Changes are made frequently within the regulatory system of Chinese GB Standards. New standards are released, existing standards are changed or updated. In 2014, GB Standard 15084-2013 for rear view mirrors as well as GB Standard 14166:2013 (“Safety-belts, restraint systems, child restraint systems and ISOFIX child restraint systems for occupants of power-driven vehicles”) will be revised and implemented. Above that, GB Standard 27887-2011 “Restraining devices for child occupants of power-driven vehicles” will become mandatory.

'''Hiram Hunter''' (10 February 1874 – 9 May 1966) was a New Zealand politician and trade unionist.

==Early life==
Born in [[Christchurch]] in 1874, Hunter was a [[farmer]], storekeeper, carter, and [[trade unionist]].&lt;ref name="DNZB Hunter"&gt;{{DNZB|McAloon|Jim |3h46|Hunter, Hiram - Biography|2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Hunter stood for the [[Christchurch East]] electorate in the [[New Zealand House of Representatives]] in {{NZ election link year|1911}} for the [[New Zealand Labour Party (1910)|Labour Party (original)]], {{NZ election link year|1914}} for the [[Social Democratic Party (New Zealand)|Social Democratic Party]] and {{NZ election link year|1919}} for the [[New Zealand Labour Party]]. His best result was losing by 136 votes in 1911 in a close three-way contest, and failing to qualify for the subsequent [[Two-round system|run-off election]] by just four votes. He was President of the LRC{{Clarify|date=June 2013}} (1911–1913) and of the Social Democratic Party (1913–1915). In {{NZ election link year|1931}}, he contested the [[Mid-Canterbury (New Zealand electorate)|Mid-Canterbury]] electorate as an [[Independent Labour]] candidate against [[Jeremiah Connolly]], but was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Gustafson|1980|p=159}}

During the 1930s, Hunter became increasingly disillusioned with the NZ Labour Party and argued that: ''"We have learned much of socialisation through its application in Russia. The result has been servility for the workers under the domination of dictators and, what seemed a book of beautiful ideal in 1915 has turned out to be in practice, a horrible reality"''.&lt;ref&gt;(The Christchurch Press, 6 October 1938)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 he stood for the conservative [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] against his former Labour comrade [[Dan Sullivan (New Zealand politician)|Dan Sullivan]] who beat him by a three to one margin, with the election-night crowd booing him so loudly his speech could not be heard leaving Hunter with an undignified end to his public career.&lt;ref name="DNZB Hunter"/&gt;

Hiram Hunter was a member of the [[Christchurch City Council]] for ten years (1911–1915; 1917–1923).&lt;ref name="Councillors"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www1.ccc.govt.nz/handbook/councillorsofthecityofchristchurch.asp| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720010657/http://www1.ccc.govt.nz/handbook/councillorsofthecityofchristchurch.asp | archivedate = 20 July 2011 |title=Councillors of the City of Christchurch |publisher=Christchurch City Council|accessdate=2 November 2012 |location=Christchurch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hubert Looser''' (born 5 April 1938 in [[Vilters-Wangs|Vilters]], [[Switzerland]])&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.altertuemliches.at/biografie/hubert-looser |title=Hubert Looser |publisher=FindART |access-date=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a former Swiss [[Businessperson|businessman]], [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]] and [[Private collection|art collector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.museum-folkwang.de/fileadmin/_BE_Gruppe_Folkwang/Dokumente/2016_Pressemitteilungen/Looser/PM_Looser_MuseumFolkwang_Biografie.pdf |title=Biografie Hubert Looser |publisher=Museum Folkwang |access-date=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looser was President of Walter Rentsch Holding AG and ELCO Looser Holding AG. Today Looser is active as a member of the board of the Hubert Looser Foundation.

== Life ==
Looser was the sixth born of seven children in 1938 in the Swiss town of Vilters, where he also grew up and attended school. His parents were [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurs]] and had built the company ELCO. After Looser had earned his MBA from [[Columbia University]] [[New York (state)|New York]],&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; he joined his parents company in 1964 and was responsible for the establishment and leadership of the ELCO Group in [[France]], [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]] until 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/zuercher_kultur/das-kunsthaus-muss-spannender-werden-1.18090779 |title=Das Kunsthaus muss spannender werden |author=Samuel Herzog, Urs Steiner |date=1 June 2013 |publisher=Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) |access-date=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, the founding of Remaco AG for business mediation and the takeover of Walter Rentsch AG in the field of office technology took place. In 1973, Looser took over the management of Walter Rentsch AG with 120 employees, which at his resignation in 1992, consisted of 1,200 employees. 1990/92 Looser resigned as president of the corporate groups Walter Rentsch AG and ELCO Looser Holding AG.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fondation-hubert-looser.ch/Literatur/pdf/Der_Sammler_Lebenslauf.pdf |title=Lebenslauf Hubert Looser |date=1 March 2017 |publisher=Fondation Hubert Looser |access-date=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After selling his company shares, Hubert Looser became increasingly involved in the Fondation Hubert Looser, which he co-founded in 1988 and in which he still serves as president and financially supports his fortune with around 40 worldwide [[aid]] projects. Among other things, came the realization of projects for people with disabilities and children in need, as well as training support for young people in countries such as [[Cambodia]], [[Albania]] and [[Romania]] or [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] projects in [[South Africa]], [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;

Looser is married with Ursula Looser Stingelin, a father of two children from a previous marriage and lives in Zurich.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

== Art collection ==
During his stay in Paris in 1957 in order to learn the language, posters from an [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] exhibition made a big impression on him and he went to museums around the world whenever he had the time. In his twenties, Looser completed various study trips during his training period to [[Mexico]], [[Japan]], [[Paris]], [[London]] or [[New York (state)|New York]] and laid the foundation of his passion for collecting art. However, his collections first 200 works were mostly Swiss art. Today, Hubert Looser, is considered to be an outstanding private art collector in the Swiss area. His collections main focus is on works of [[surrealism]], [[Abstract expressionism]] and [[minimalism]]. One of [[Willem de Kooning]]'s largest collections outside of the [[United States|US]] is as part of the collection. The museum-suitable works of the collection were introduced in 2008 to the Fondation Hubert Looser, which makes this cultural asset available to the public as a permanent exhibition at the [[Kunsthaus Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.blick.ch/life/kunst-kunsthaus-zuerich-erhaelt-74-zeitgenoessische-werke-als-dauerleihgabe-id1854822.html |title=Kunsthaus Zürich erhält 74 zeitgenössische Werke als Dauerleihgabe |publisher=Blick |access-date=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|''' Ikeda Shigeaki '''|池田成彬 |extra=15 August 1867 &amp;ndash; 9 October 1950}}, also known as '''Seihin Ikeda''', was a politician, cabinet minister and businessman in the [[Empire of Japan]], prominent in the early decades of the 20th century. He served as director of [[Mitsui|Mitsui Bank]] from 1909-1933, was appointed governor of the [[Bank of Japan]] in 1937, and served as [[Minister of Finance (Japan)|Minister of Finance]] under [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Fumimaro Konoe]] from 1937 to 1939. In 1941, he was made a member of the [[Privy Council (Japan)|Imperial Privy Council]]; following Japan's defeat in [[World War II]], Ikeda was [[Purge (occupied Japan)|banned]] from public political service.&lt;ref name=frederic&gt;Frédéric, Louis. "Ikeda Seihin". ''Japan Encyclopedia''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Ikeda was born in 1867, the final year of the [[Bakumatsu period]] in [[Yonezawa Domain]] (modern [[Yamagata Prefecture]]), as the eldest son of noted [[samurai]] [[Ikeda Nariaki]]. He moved to Tokyo at age 13. His initial efforts to enroll in either [[Keio University]] or [[Tokyo Imperial University]] failed due to his lack of [[English language]] skills; however after 18 months of private tutoring he was able to secure admission into the newly formed Department of Economics at Keio University in 1890. At the recommendation of Harvard professor Arthur Knapp, who was stationed at Keio University, Ikeda was sent to study at [[Harvard University]] in the United States from 1890-1895. After graduation, he returned to Japan and obtained a job at the Jiji Shimpo newspaper, but quit after only three weeks.

In December 1895, at the recommendation of director [[Nakamigawa Hirojirō]] Ikeda began working at Mitsui Bank. After being assigned to the Osaka branch, he was made director of the bank's Ashikaga branch, following which he worked on reform proposals for the underwriting of municipal bonds for Osaka, and for deposit agreements between banks. He was then sent back to the United States in 1898 to study banking modernization. After his return in 1900, he rose rapidly through the hierarchy within the [[Mitsui zaibatsu]]. In 1904, he married the eldest daughter of managing director Nakamigawa Hirojirō. He helped establish Mitsui Bank as a stock company in 1911, of which he became a director and was appointed managing director in 1919.

After the [[Showa Financial Crisis]] of 1927, Ikeda came under criticism when it was discovered that his precipitous withdrawal of funds from the overextended [[Bank of Taiwan]] in order to protect Mitsui assets was one of the primary causes for the collapse of the Bank of Taiwan, the second-tier [[zaibatsu]] [[Suzuki Shoten]], and the subsequent financial panic.

Ikeda became de facto head of the Mitsui zaibatsu in 1932. He was able to depose the Mitsui family from the senior management of the zaibatsu and from the leadership of key group companies, which he took public by offering stock on the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]]. He was also influential in donations to numerous charity and social projects. Ikeda also implemented a retirement system within Mitsui set at the age of 70, at which point he also retired.
  
==Public career==
On his retirement from Mitsui in 1937,Ikeda accepted the position of president of the [[Bank of Japan]]. The same year, he was asked to become a Cabinet councilor by [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Fumimaro Konoe]]. He was also an advisor to the Ministry of Finance, the North China Development Company and Central China Promotion Company. From 1938-1939, he became both [[Minister of Finance (Japan)|Minister of Finance]] and [[Ministry of Commerce and Industry (Japan)|Minister of Commerce and Industry]].

On 5 December 1938, along with the Prime Minister, [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Foreign Minister]] [[Hachirō Arita]], [[Ministry of War of Japan|Army Minister]] [[Seishirō Itagaki]], and [[Ministry of the Navy of Japan|Navy Minister]] [[Mitsumasa Yonai]], Ikeda took part in the [[Five Ministers' Conference]], a secret meeting of the highest officials in the Japanese government, to discuss the government's position on world [[Jews|Jewry]]. While the Foreign Minister and others were opposed to any formal involvement with the Jewish people, on the basis of their uncontrollable nature and devious schemes as detailed in the ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' and the threat they posed according to [[Nazi]] ideology, Ikeda, along with Army Minister Itagaki, argued that a population of Jews would be a great asset to Japan, attracting foreign capital and improving world opinion towards Japan. The meeting ultimately proved a crucial step in the development of the "[[Fugu Plan]]" which would bring several thousand Jews to the Empire of Japan, from Nazi-controlled Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Tokayer, Marvin and Mary Swartz. ''The Fugu Plan: The Untold Story of the Japanese and the Jews During World War Two''. New York: Weatherhill, Inc., 1979. pp56-61.&lt;/ref&gt;
Ikeda's name was floated as a possible successor to Konoe as Prime Minister; however, this was strongly opposed by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], with whom Ikeda had repeatedly clashed over matters of finance. However, he was retained as a Cabinet councilor under Prime Minister [[Hiranuma Kiichirō]], and was also President of the Price Control Board.

Ikeda became a member of the [[Privy Council (Japan)|Privy Council]] in 1941, and was banned from engaging in political activity as a result, following the end of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=frederic/&gt;

==Post-war period==
In December 1945, following the [[surrender of Japan]], Ikeda was arrested on the orders of the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|US occupation authorities]] as a suspect on charges of Class A [[war crimes]]. He was released without any charges filed in May 1946; however, as with all members of the wartime Japanese government, he was barred from holding any public office. He withdrew to his summer home in [[Oiso, Kanagawa]], but cooperated with the American occupation officials in the dissolution of the zaibatsu, which earned him the enmity of many former colleagues within the Mitsui group. His close neighbor, Prime Minister [[Shigeru Yoshida]] also consulted with Ikeda frequently on matters of finance and personnel. Ikeda died at his home in Oiso in 1950, due to complications arising from intestinal ulcers.

'''International standards''' are standards developed by international [[standards organization]]s. International standards are available for consideration and use worldwide. The most prominent organization is the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO).

==Purpose==
International standards may be used either by direct application or by a process of modifying an international standard to suit local conditions. The adoption of international standards results in the creation of equivalent, national standards that are substantially the same as international standards in technical content, but may have (i) editorial differences as to appearance, use of symbols and measurement units, substitution of a point for a comma as the decimal marker, and (ii) differences resulting from conflicts in governmental [[regulation]]s or industry-specific requirements caused by fundamental climatic, geographical, technological, or infrastructural factors, or the stringency of safety requirements that a given standard authority considers appropriate.

International standards are one way of overcoming technical barriers in international commerce caused by differences among technical regulations and standards developed independently and separately by each nation, national standards organization, or company. Technical barriers arise when different groups come together, each with a large user base, doing some well established thing that between them is mutually incompatible. Establishing international standards is one way of preventing or overcoming this problem.

==History==

===Standardization===
[[File:JFIScrewThread300.png|thumb|right|Graphic representation of formulae for the pitches of threads of screw bolts]]
The implementation of standards in industry and commerce became highly important with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the need for high-precision [[machine tool]]s and [[interchangeable parts]]. [[Henry Maudslay]] developed the first industrially practical [[screw-cutting lathe]] in 1800, which allowed for the standardisation of [[screw thread]] sizes for the first time.&lt;ref name="Ping"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/econwp117.pdf|title=A Brief History of Standards and Standardization Organizations: A Chinese Perspective|author=Wang Ping|publisher=EAST-WEST CENTER WORKING PAPERS|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maudslay's work, as well as the contributions of other engineers, accomplished a modest amount of industry standardization; some companies' in-house standards spread a bit within their industries. [[Joseph Whitworth]]'s screw thread measurements were adopted as the  first (unofficial) national standard by companies around the country in 1841. It came to be known as the [[British Standard Whitworth]], and was widely adopted in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, K. R., &amp; Galloway, D. F., 1978, "Machine Tools". In C. Singer, et al., (Eds.), ''A history of technology''. Oxford, Clarendon Press &amp; Lee, S. (Ed.), 1900, ''Dictionary of national biography'', Vol LXI. Smith Elder, London&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th century differences in standards between companies were making trade increasingly difficult and strained. The [[BSI Group|Engineering Standards Committee]] was established in London in 1901 as the world's first national standards body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsigroup.com/upload/Corporate%20Marketing/Financial%20Performance/BSI_Group_Annual_Report_and_Financial_Statements_2010.pdf |title=BSI Group Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010, page 2|format=PDF|accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert C McWilliam 2001"&gt;Robert C McWilliam. BSI: The first hundred years. 2001. Thanet Press. London&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[First World War]], similar national bodies were established in other countries. The [[Deutsches Institut für Normung]] was set up in Germany in 1917, followed by its counterparts, the American [[American National Standards Institute|National Standard Institute]] and the French  [[AFNOR|Commission Permanente de Standardisation]], both in 1918.&lt;ref name="Ping" /&gt;

===International organizations===
[[File:crompton.jpg|thumb|right|[[R. E. B. Crompton]] drew up the first international standards body, the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]], in 1906.]]
By the mid to late 19th century, efforts were being made to standardize electrical measurement. An important figure was [[R. E. B. Crompton]], who became concerned by the large range of different standards and systems used by electrical engineering companies and scientists in the early 20th century. Many companies had entered the market in the 1890s and all chose their own settings for [[volt]]age, [[frequency]], [[Electric current|current]] and even the symbols used on circuit diagrams. Adjacent buildings would have totally incompatible electrical systems simply because they had been fitted out by different companies. Crompton could see the lack of efficiency in this system and began to consider proposals for an international standard for electric engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iec.ch/about/history/articles/colonel_crompton.htm ''Colonel Crompton'', IEC Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903145102/http://www.iec.ch/about/history/articles/colonel_crompton.htm |date=2010-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, Crompton represented Britain at the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|Saint Louis]] as part of a delegation by the [[Institute of Electrical Engineers]]. He presented a paper on standardisation, which was so well received that he was asked to look into the formation of a commission to oversee the process.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J &amp; Randell, W (1948) ''Colonel Crompton and the Evolution of the Electrical Industry'', Longman Green.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1906 his work was complete and he drew up a permanent constitution for the first international standards organization, the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TAi_QBsTz5UC|title=Encyclopedia of Electrochemical Power Sources|author1=Chris K. Dyer |author2=Patrick T. Moseley |author3=Zempachi Ogumi |author4=David A. J. Rand |author5=Bruno Scrosati Newnes |year=2010|page=540}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body held its first meeting that year in London, with representatives from 14 countries. In honour of his contribution to electrical standardisation, Lord Kelvin was elected as the body's first President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iec.ch/about/history/documents/pdf/IEC_Founding_Meeting_Report_1906.pdf | title=1906 Preliminary Meeting Report, pp 46-48 | work=The minutes from our first meeting | author=IEC | accessdate=21 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Memory plaque of founding ISA in Prague cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial plaque of founding ISA in [[Prague]].]]
The [[International Federation of the National Standardizing Associations]] (ISA) was founded in 1926 with a broader remit to enhance international cooperation for all technical standards and specifications. The body was suspended in 1942 during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]].

After the war, ISA was approached by the recently formed United Nations Standards Coordinating Committee (UNSCC) with a proposal to form a new global standards body. In October 1946, ISA and UNSCC delegates from 25 countries met in [[London]] and agreed to join forces to create the new [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO); the new organization officially began operations in February&amp;nbsp;1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/2012_friendship_among_equals.pdf|title=Friendship among equals - Recollections from ISO's first fifty years|publisher=International Organization for Standardization|year=1997|isbn=92-67-10260-5|pages=15–18|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International trade law''' includes the appropriate rules and customs for handling trade between countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.berkeley.edu/library/dynamic/guide.php?id=60#toc0|title=International Trade Law|last=Library|first=University of California Berkeley School of Law|website=www.law.berkeley.edu|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is also used in legal writings as trade between private sectors, which is not right. This branch of law is now an independent field of study as most governments have become part of the world trade, as members of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). Since the transaction between private sectors of different countries is an important part of the WTO activities, this latter branch of law is now a very important part of the academic works and is under study in many universities across the world.

==Overview==
International trade law should be distinguished from the broader field of [[international economic law]].  The latter could be said to encompass not only WTO law, but also law governing the international [[monetary system]] and [[currency]] regulation, as well as the law of [[international development]].

The body of rules for transnational trade in the 21st century derives from medieval commercial laws called the ''[[lex mercatoria]]'' and ''[[lex maritima]]'' — respectively, "the law for merchants on land" and "the law for merchants on the sea." Modern trade law (extending beyond bilateral treaties) began shortly after the [[Second World War]], with the negotiation of a multilateral treaty to deal with trade in goods: the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT).

International trade law is based on theories of [[economic liberalism]] developed in [[Europe]] and later the [[United States]] from the 18th century onwards.

International Trade Law is an aggregate of legal rules of “international legislation” and new lex mercatoria, regulating relations in international trade. '''“International legislation”''' – international treaties and acts of international intergovernmental organizations regulating relations in international trade.
'''lex mercatoria'''  - "the law for merchants on land". Alok Narayan defines "lex mercatoria" as "any law relating to businesses" which was criticised by Professor Julius Stone.
and 
'''lex maritime'''  - "the law for merchants on sea. Alok in his recent article criticised this definition to be "too narrow" and "merely-creative". Professor Dodd and Professor Malcolm Shaw of Leeds University supported this proposition.

==World Trade Organization==
In 1995, the [[World Trade Organization]], a formal international organization to regulate trade, was established.  It is the most important development in the history of international trade law.

The purposes and structure of the organization is governed by the ''Agreement Establishing The World Trade Organization'', also known as the "[[Marrakesh Agreement]]".  It does not specify the actual rules that govern international trade in specific areas. These are found in separate treaties, annexed to the Marrakesh Agreement.

The scope of WTO :

(a) provide a framework for administration and implementation of agreements;
(b) forum for further negotiations;
(c) trade policy review mechanism; and
(d) promote greater coherence among members economics policies

Principles of the WTO:

(a) A principle of non-discrimination (most-favored-nation treatment obligation and the national treatment obligation)
(b) market access (reduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade) 
(c) balancing trade liberalization and other societal interests
(d) harmonization of national regulation (TRIPS agreement, TBT agreement, SPS agreement)

==Trade in goods==
The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT) has been the backbone of international trade law since 1948 after the charter for international trade had been agreed upon in [[Havana]].  It contains rules relating to "unfair" trading practices — [[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]] and [[subsidy|subsidies]]. Many things impacted GATT like the [[Uruguay Round]] and the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1994 the World Trade Organization (WTO) was established to take the place of the GATT. This is because the GATT was meant to be a temporary fix to trade issues, and the founders hoped for something more concrete. It took many years for this to come about, however, because of the lack of money. The British Economy was in crisis and there was not much backing from Congress to pass the new agreement.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The idea of these agreements ( WTO and [http://search.proquest.com/docview/220713673/4FC715D36F734E68PQ/20?accountid=26218 GATT] was to create an equal field for all countries in trade. This way all countries got something of equal value out of the trade. This was a difficult thing to do since every country has a different economy size. This led to the [[Trade Expansion Act|Trade Expansion act]] of 1962.{{[[Trade_Expansion_Act]}}

==Trade and intellectual property==
The World Trade Organization Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ([[TRIPS]]) agreement required signatory nations to raise [[intellectual property rights]] (also known as intellectual monopoly privileges). This arguably has had a negative impact on access to essential medicines in some nations such as less developed countries, as the local economy is not as capable of producing more technical products such as pharmaceuticals.

==Cross-border transactions==

Cross-border operations are subject to taxation by more than one country. Commercial activity that occurs among several jurisdictions or countries is called a cross-border transaction. Those involved in any international business development or international trade should be knowledgeable in [[International taxation|tax law]], as every country enforces different laws on foreign businesses. International tax planning ensures that cross-border businesses stay tax compliant and avoid or lessen [[double taxation]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Dispute settlement==

Most prominent in the area of dispute settlement in international trade law is the WTO dispute settlement system. The WTO dispute settlement body is operational since 1995 and has been very active since then with 369 cases in the time between 1 January 1995 and 1 December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=van den Bossche|first=Peter|title=The Law and Policy of the World Trade Organization - Text, Cases and Materials|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Maastricht University|isbn=978-0-521-72759-4|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nearly a quarter of disputes reached an amicable solution, in other cases the parties to the dispute resorted to adjudication. The WTO dispute settlement body has exclusive and compulsory jurisdiction over disputes on WTO law (Article 23.1 Dispute Settlement Understanding&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title = "Governance of International Trade Under World Trade Organization Agreements-Relationships Between World Trade Organization Agreements and Other Trade Agreements."|url = Http://search.proquest.com/docview/217554638/4FC715D36F734E68PQ/3?accountid=26218}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''János Thurzó''' ({{lang-hu|Thurzó János}}, {{lang-de|Johann T(h)urzo}}, {{lang-pl|Jan Turzo}}, {{lang-sk|Ján T(h)urzo}}; April 30, 1437 in [[Lőcse]] – October 10, 1508 in [[Nagybánya]]) was a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] entrepreneur and [[Mining engineering|mining engineer]]. From 1477 until his death he was an [[Alderman]] (a member of the city council) of [[Kraków]], [[Poland]], and became even its [[mayor]] for a while.

By establishing "The Common Hungarian Trade" ({{lang-de|Gemeine Ungarische Handel}}, also known as Fugger–Thurzo company), he developed a very profitable business relationship with [[Jakob Fugger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kayo |last=Hirakawa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fJ-dQpbfrysC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=Thurz%C3%B3+family&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qRmJTMy5OdjPjAei1MWgDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Pictorialization of Dürer's Drawings in Northern Europe in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries |page=48 |location= |publisher=Peter Lang |year=2009 |isbn=3-03911-725-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which held a de facto [[monopoly]] over [[copper mining]] and trade in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] around 1500.

Thurzo first married Ursula Boehm and the couple had three sons: György Thurzó who married Anna [[Fugger]], later György Thurzó became the [[Local government in Kraków|mayor of Kraków]]; another son of [[Johann V Thurzo|János]], became the [[Bishop of Wrocław|archbishop]] of [[Breslau]] (today [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Wrocław|Wroclaw]]); and their [[Stanislav I. Thurzo|third son]] became the [[Bishop of Olomouc|bishop]] of [[Olomouc]].

His second marriage was Barbara Beck: their daughter Katharina married [[Johann Jakob Fugger]].

'''Land grabbing''' is the contentious issue of large-scale land acquisitions: the buying or leasing of large pieces of land by domestic and [[Multinational corporation|transnational companies]], governments, and individuals. While used broadly throughout history, land grabbing as used in the 21st century primarily refers to large-scale land acquisitions following the [[2007–08 world food price crisis]].&lt;ref name=Borras&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borras Jr.|first=Saturnino M. |author2=Ruth Hall |author3=Ian Scoones |author4=Ben White |author5=Wendy Wolford|title=Towards a better understanding of global land grabbing: an editorial introduction|journal=[[Journal of Peasant Studies]]|date=24 March 2011|volume=38|issue=2|pages=209|doi=10.1080/03066150.2011.559005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obtaining water resources is usually critical to the land acquisitions, so it has also led to an associated trend of [[water grabbing]].&lt;ref name=PNAC-2013-110-03&gt;Maria Cristina Rullia, Antonio Savioria, and Paolo D’Odorico, [http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/01/02/1213163110 Global Land and Water Grabbing], ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' 110, no. 3 (2013): 892–97.&lt;/ref&gt; By prompting [[food security]] fears within the developed world and new found economic opportunities for agricultural investors, the food price crisis caused a dramatic spike in large-scale agricultural investments, primarily foreign, in the [[Global South]] for the purpose of industrial [[food production|food]] and [[biofuel]]s production. Although hailed by investors, economists and some developing countries as a new pathway towards agricultural development, investment in land in the 21st century has been criticized by some [[non-governmental organization]]s and commentators as having a negative impact on local communities. [[International law]] is implicated when attempting to regulate these transactions.&lt;ref name=Regulating&gt;[[Lea Brilmayer]] and William J.

== Definition ==

The term "land grabbing" is defined as very large-scale land acquisitions, either buying or leasing.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The size of the land deal is multiples of [[Orders of magnitude (area)#108 to 1014 sqm|{{convert|1000|km2}}]] or {{convert|100000|ha}} and thus much larger than in the past.&lt;ref name=Outsourcing-third-wave/&gt;  The term is itself controversial. In 2011, Borras, Hall and others wrote that "the phrase 'global land grab' has become a catch-all to describe and analyze the current trend towards {{Sic|hide=y|large| |expected=large-}} scale (trans)national commercial land transactions."&lt;ref name=Borras /&gt; Ruth Hall wrote elsewhere that the "term 'land grabbing', while effective as [[activist]] terminology, obscures vast differences in the [[legality]], structure, and outcomes of commercial land deals and deflects attention from the roles of domestic elites and governments as partners, [[intermediaries]], and [[beneficiaries]]."&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hall |first=Ruth|title=Land grabbing in Southern Africa: the many faces of the investor rush|journal=Review of African Political Economy |date=June 2011|volume=38|pages=193–214|doi=10.1080/03056244.2011.582753 |issue=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Portuguese, Land Grabbing is translated as "grilagem": "Much is said about grilagem and the term may be curious ... document aged by the action of insects &lt;ref&gt; DEVISATE, Rogério Reis. Grilagem das Terras e da Soberania. Rio de janeiro. Editora Imagem Art Studio, 2017, p. 28 -  https://www.rogeriodevisate.com.br/grilagemdeterrasedasoberania: "I suggest the expression may have another setting. Just as the grileiro disguises his deeds and often produces a physical document that seems legally good and valuable in spite of everything - even though it does not withstand more careful analysis - the insects that inspire the word "grilagem" also live in the garden or hidden under foliage, emitting natural sounds and, thus, giving signs of their existence, and they can be located " &lt;/ref&gt; ... However, for those who live in the interior of the country, the expression effectively reveals a dark, heavy, violent meaning, involving abuses and arbitrary actions against the former occupants, occasionally with forced loss of possession by the taking of land " &lt;ref&gt; DEVISATE, Rogério Reis. Grilagem das Terras e da Soberania. Rio de janeiro. Editora Imagem Art Studio, 2017, p. 16 -  https://www.rogeriodevisate.com.br/grilagemdeterrasedasoberania&lt;/ref&gt;  The term grilagem applies to irregular procedures and / or illegal private landholding with violence in the countryside, exploitation of wealth, environmental damage and the threat to sovereignty&lt;ref&gt; DEVISATE, Rogério Reis. Grilagem das Terras e da Soberania. Rio de janeiro. Editora Imagem Art Studio, 2017, p. 21 - https://www.rogeriodevisate.com.br/grilagemdeterrasedasoberania
: "How far is the idea of national sovereignty compromised by land grabbing?" &lt;/ref&gt;, given their gigantic proportions.

== Situation in the 21st century ==

===Land Area===
The [[Overseas Development Institute]] reported in January 2013, that with limited data available in general and existing data associated with NGOs interested in generating media attention in particular, the scale of global land trade may have been exaggerated. They found the figures below provide a variety of estimates, all in the tens of millions of hectares.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform"&gt;Joseph Holden and Margarethe Pagel, Jan 2013, Transnational land acquisitions, ECONOMIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR PROFESSIONAL EVIDENCE AND APPLIED KNOWLEDGE SERVICES, 49p, http://partnerplatform.org/?azrv33t9&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] (IFPRI) estimated in 2009 between 15 and 20 million hectares of farmland in developing countries had changed hands since 2006.&lt;ref name=Outsourcing-third-wave&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/13692889 | work=The Economist | title=Outsourcing's third wave | date=23 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{as of|January 2013}} the [[Land Portal]]’s [[Land Matrix]] data totalled 49 million hectares of deals globally, although only 26 million hectares of these are transnational.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
*A 2011 World Bank report by Klaus Deininger reported 56 million hectares worldwide.&lt;ref name=Rising-Global-Interest-Farmland&gt;{{cite news| url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DEC/Resources/Rising-Global-Interest-in-Farmland.pdf | work=The World Bank | title= Rising Global Interest in Farmland | date=March 2015}},&lt;/ref&gt;
*Friis &amp; Reenberg (2012) reported in 2012 between 51 and 63 million hectares in Africa alone.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
*The [[GRAIN]] database&lt;ref name=graindb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grain.org/article/entries/4479-grain-releases-data-set-with-over-400-global-land-grabs|title=GRAIN — GRAIN releases data set with over 400 global land grabs|author=|date=|website=www.grain.org|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in January 2012, quantified 35 million hectares, although when stripping out more developed economies such as [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Romania]], the amount in the GRAIN database reduces to 25 million hectares.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}
* Between 1990 and 2011, in the [[West Bank]] ([[Palestinian territories|Palestine]]) 195 km2 of land was expropriated by [[Israel]], without compensation for the local owners, and allocated to immigrants for new settlements and for the establishment of mostly large farms. Water for the local population became extremely sparse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btselem.org/publications/summaries/200205_land_grab|title=Land Grab|author=|date=|website=B'Tselem|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, as a part of a permanent process 300 acres of land were added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/charlotte-silver/israels-west-bank-land-grabs-biggest-decades|title=Israel's West Bank land grabs biggest in decades|first=Charlotte|last=Silver|date=30 March 2016|website=electronicintifada.net|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most seem to arrive at a ballpark of 20-60 million hectares. Given that total global farmland takes up just over 4 billion hectares,&lt;ref&gt;Byerlee, Derek and Deininger, Klaus (2011), Rising Global Interest in Farmland, The World Bank&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}} these acquisitions could equate to around 1 per cent of global farmland. However, in practice, land acquired may not have previously been used as farmland, it may be covered by forests, which also equate to about 4 billion hectares worldwide, so transnational [[land acquisitions]] may have a significant role in ongoing [[deforestation]].&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

The researchers thought that a sizeable number of deals remain questionable in terms of size and whether they have been finalised and implemented. The land database often relies on one or two media sources and may not track whether the investments take place, or whether the full quantity reported takes place. For example, a number of deals in the GRAIN database&lt;ref name=graindb/&gt; appear to have stalled including -
*1 million hectares taken between US firms [[Arc Cap]] and [[Nile Trading and Development Inc]] in [[Sudan]]
*A 400,000 hectare deal between [[China]] and [[Colombia]] that seems to have stalled
*The 325,000 hectare investment by [[Agrisol]] in [[Tanzania]]
*A 324,000 hectare purchase of land by the [[UAE]] in [[Pakistan]]
*A suspended 320,000 hectare purchase by Chinese investors in [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

The researchers claim these are only those that have been checked, and already amount to nearly 10 per cent of the GRAIN database transnational land acquisitions. Deals are reported that use the estimate of the full extent of land that the firm expects to use. For example,
*Indian investment in [[Tanzania]] is reported at 300,000 hectares, currently operating on just 1,000 hectares
*[[Olam International]]’s investment in [[Gabon]] reported at 300,000 hectares, currently operating on just 50,000
*Three investments amounting to 600,000 hectares in [[Liberia]], with [[Equatorial Palm Oil]]’s deal reported at 169,000 hectares, despite their plans to reach just 50,000 by 2020.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

===Land Value===
The researchers found that in terms of value of transnational land acquisitions, it is even harder to come across figures. Media reports usually just give information on the area and not on the value of the land transaction. Investment estimates, rather than the price of purchase are occasionally given&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

They found a number of reports in land databases are not acquisitions, but are long-term leases, where a fee is paid or a certain proportion of the produce goes to domestic markets. For example:&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}
*An Indian investment in Ethiopia, where price per hectare ranged from $1.20 to $8 per hectare per year on 311,000 hectares
*Indian investors paid $4 per hectare per year on 100,000 hectares.
*Prince [[Bandar Bin Sultan]] of Saudi Arabia was reported to be paying $125,000 per year for 105,000 hectares in South Sudan, less than $1 per year on a 25-year lease.
*A South Korean investor in Peru was reported to be paying $0.80 per hectare.

The estimated value has been calculated for [[International Food Policy Research Institute|IFPRI]]’s 2009 data to be 15 to 20 million hectares of farmland in developing countries, worth about $20 billion-$30 billion.&lt;ref name=Outsourcing-third-wave/&gt;

Researchers discovered global investment funds are reported to have sizeable funds available for transnational land investments.
*One estimate suggests “$100 billion waiting to be invested by 120 investment groups” while already “[[Saudi Arabia]] has spent $800 million on overseas farms”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westerninvestor.com/index.php/news/55-features/764-land-values&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, a farm consultancy [[HighQuest]] told [[Reuters]]  “Private capital investment in farming in expected to more than double to around $5-$7 billion in the next couple of years from an estimated $2.5-$3 billion invested in the last couple of years”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albertafarmexpress.ca/news/farm-private-investment-seen-doubling-in-two-years/1000408695|title=Farm private investment seen doubling in two years - Alberta Farmer Express|author=|date=|website=www.albertafarmexpress.ca|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is significant uncertainty around the value of transnational land acquisitions, particularly given leasing arrangements. Given the quantity of land and the size of investment funds operating in the area, it is likely that the value will be in the tens of billions of dollars.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

===Land destinations===
Researchers used the Land Portal’s Land Matrix database of 49 billion hectares of land deals, and found that Asia is a big centre of activity with [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]] counting for a quarter of international deals by hectares. [[India]] contributes a further 10 per cent of land deals. The majority of investment is in the production of [[palm oil]] and other [[biofuels]].&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

They determined that the Land Portal also reports investments made by investors within their home country and after stripping these out found only 26 million hectares of transnational land acquisitions which strips out a lot of the Asian investments. The largest destination countries include
*[[Brazil]] with 11 per cent by land area
*[[Sudan]] with 10 per cent
*[[Madagascar]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Ethiopia]] with 8 per cent each
*[[Mozambique]] with 7 per cent
*[[Indonesia]] with 6 per cent.
&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;

They found the reason seems to be biofuels expansion with exceptions in [[Sudan]] and [[Ethiopia]], which sees a trend towards growth of food from [[Middle East]]ern and [[India]]n investors. Represented in the media as the norm they seem to be more the exception.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;

===Land origins===
The researchers found a mixed picture in terms of the origins of investors. According to the [[Land Portal]], the [[United Kingdom]] is the biggest country of origin followed by the [[United States]], [[India]], the [[UAE]], [[South Africa]], [[Canada]] and [[Malaysia]], with [[China]] a much smaller player. The [[GRAIN]] database&lt;ref name=graindb/&gt; says:
*[[United States]], the [[UAE]] and [[China]] all constitute around 12 per cent of deals
*[[India]] with 8 per cent
*[[Egypt]] and the [[UK]] with 6 per cent
*[[South Korea]] with 5 per cent
* [[South Africa]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]] all with 4 per cent.
Both the [[Land Portal]] and the GRAIN database show that the UK and the US are major players in transnational land acquisitions. This is agribusiness firms, as well as investment funds, investing mostly in [[sugar cane]], [[jatropha]] or [[palm oil]]. This trend has clearly been driven by the [[biofuels targets]] in the [[European Union|EU]] and US, and greater [[vertical integration]] in [[agribusiness]] in general.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;

The smaller trend is the picture of Middle Eastern investors or State-backed Chinese investments. While the [[UAE]] has done some significant deals by size, some driven by food deals, with Saudi Arabia a smaller number, this is not the dominant trend. While this aspect of land trade has gathered lots of media attention, it is not by any means a comprehensive story.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform"/&gt;

===Other deals===
Other estimates of the scope of land acquisition, published in September 2010 by the [[World Bank]], showed that over [[Orders of magnitude (area)#108 to 1014 sqm|{{convert|460000| km2}}]] or {{convert|46000000|ha}} in large-scale farmland acquisitions or negotiations were announced between October 2008 and August 2009 alone, with two-thirds of demanded land concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name=Deininger&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Of the World Bank’s 464 examined acquisitions, only 203 included land area in their reports, implying that the actual total land covered could more than double the World Bank’s reported 46 million ha. The most recent estimate of the scale, based on evidence presented in April 2011 at an international conference convened by the Land Deal Politics Initiative, estimated the area of land deals at over 80 million ha.&lt;ref name="Borras Scoones"&gt;{{cite news|last=Borras|first=Jun|title=Small-scale farmers increasingly at risk from 'global land grabbing' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/apr/15/risks-over-increasing-global-land-deals |accessdate=22 August 2011|newspaper=The Guardian.co.uk: Poverty Matters Blog|date=15 April 2011|author2=Ian Scoones|author3=David Hughes|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of these deals, the median size is [[Orders of magnitude (area)#100 to 107 sqm|{{convert|40000|ha}}]], with one-quarter over 200,000 ha and one-quarter under 10,000 ha.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; 37% of projects deal with [[food crops]], 21% with [[cash crops]], and 21% with [[biofuels]].&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; This points to the vast diversity of investors and projects involved with land acquisitions: the land sizes, crop types, and investors involved vary wildly between agreements. Of these projects, 30% were still in an exploratory stage, with 70% approved but in varying stages of development. 18% had not started yet, 30% were in initial development stages, and 21% had started farming.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; The strikingly low proportion of projects that had initiated farming signifies the difficulties inherent in large-scale agricultural production in the developing world.

Investment in land often takes the form of long-term [[lease]]s, as opposed to outright purchases, of land. These leases often range between 25 and 99 years.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; Such leases are usually undertaken between national or district governments and investors. Because the majority of land in Africa is categorized as “non-private" as a result of government policies on public land ownership and a lack of active titling, governments own or control most of the land that is available for purchase or lease.&lt;ref name="Borras Franco"&gt;{{cite news|last=Borras|first=Saturnino|title=Regulating land grabbing?|url=http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/features/69648|accessdate=26 May 2011|newspaper=Pambazuka News|date=16 December 2010|author2=Jennifer Franco}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purchases are much less common than leases due to a number of countries’ constitutional bans on [[Economic nationalism|outright sales of land to foreigners]].

The methods surrounding the negotiation, approval, and follow-up of contracts between investors and governments have attracted significant criticism for their opacity and complexity. The negotiation and approval processes have been closed in most cases, with little public disclosure both during and after the finalization of a deal. The approval process, in particular, can be cumbersome: It varies from approval by a simple district-level office to approval by multiple national-level government offices and is very subjective and discretionary.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; In Ethiopia, companies must first obtain an investment license from the central government, identify appropriate land on the district level and negotiate with local leaders, then develop a contract with the regional investment office. Afterwards, the government will undertake a project feasibility study and capital verification process, and finally a lease agreement will be signed and land will be transferred to the investor.&lt;ref name="Cotula et al."&gt;{{cite book |last=Cotula |first=Lorenzo |title=Land grab or development opportunity?

One common thread among governments has been the theme of [[economic development|development]]: Target governments tout the benefits of agricultural development, [[job creation]], [[cash crop]] production, and infrastructure provision as drivers towards [[economic development]] and eventually modernization. Many companies have promised to build [[irrigation]], roads, and in some cases hospitals and schools to carry out their investment projects. In return for a below-market-rate $10/ha annual payment for land, [[Saudi Star]] promised "to bring clinics, schools, better roads and electricity supplies to [[Gambela Region|Gambella]].”&lt;ref name="Butler 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Butler|first=Ed|title=Land grab fears for Ethiopian rural communities|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11991926|accessdate=22 August 2011|newspaper=BBC World Service|date=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments also count new job creation as a significant feature of land acquisitions.

The issue of agricultural development is a significant driving factor, within the larger umbrella of development, in target governments' agreement to investment by outsiders. The [[Ethiopia]]n government's acceptance of cash crop-based land acquisitions reflects its belief that switching to cash crop production would be even more beneficial for [[food security]] than having [[local food|local]] farmers produce crops by themselves.&lt;ref name=Davison&gt;{{cite news|last=Davison|first=William|title=Ethiopia Plans to Rent Out Belgium-Sized Land Area to Produce Cash Crops |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-26/ethiopia-plans-to-rent-out-belgium-sized-land-area-to-produce-cash-crops.html|accessdate=26 May 2011|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=26 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implicit in the characterization of African agriculture as "underdeveloped" is the rejection of local communities' traditional methods of harvesting as an inadequate form of food production.

On a smaller scale, some deals can be traced to a personal stake in the project or possibly due to [[corruption]] or [[rent-seeking]]. Given the ad hoc, decentralized, and unorganized approval processes across countries for such transactions, the potential for lapses in [[good governance|governance]] and openings for corruption are extremely high. In many countries, the [[World Bank]] has noted that investors are often better off learning how to navigate the bureaucracies and potentially pay off corrupt officers of governments rather than developing viable, sustainable business plans.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt;

=== Responses ===
Since 2010 [[Brazil]] enforces in a stricter way a long-existing law that limits the size of farmland properties foreigners may purchase, having halted a large part of projected foreign land purchases.&lt;ref name= Brazil&gt;{{cite news|title= Farmland Investment| publisher= Peer Voss, a farmland brokerage|url = http://www.argentina-estancias.com/inflationhedge-farmland.htm|quote= restrictions now limiting the size of farm land...|accessdate = 2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Argentina]], as of September 2011, a projected law is discussed in parliament that would restrict the size of land foreign entities can acquire to 1000 hectare.&lt;ref name= Argentina&gt;{{cite news|title= Farmland Investment|publisher= Peer Voss, a farmland brokerage|url = http://www.argentina-estancias.com/inflationhedge-farmland.htm|quote= discussed in congress that would limit the maximum...|accessdate = 2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of land investment ==
[[Investor]]s can be generally broken down into three types: [[agribusiness]]es, governments, and [[speculation|speculative]] investors. Governments and companies in [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf States]] have been very prominent along with [[East Asian]] companies. Many European- and American-owned investment vehicles and agricultural producers have initiated investments as well. These actors have been motivated by a number of factors, including cheap land, potential for improving agricultural production, and rising [[food prize|food]] and [[biofuel]] prices. Building on these motivations, investments can be broken down into three main categories: food, biofuel, and speculative investment. [[Forestry]] also contributes to a significant amount of large-scale land acquisition, as do several other processes: Zoomers&lt;ref&gt;Zoomers, A. (2010) ‘Globalization and the foreignization of space: The seven processes driving the current global land grab’. Journal of Peasant Studies. 37:2, 429-447.&lt;/ref&gt; mentions drivers such as the creation of protected areas and nature reserves, residential migration, large-scale tourist complexes and the creation of [[Special_economic_zone|Special Economic Zones]], particularly in Asian countries.

=== Food ===
[[Food]]-driven investments, which comprise roughly 37% of land investments worldwide, are undertaken primarily by two sets of actors: [[agribusiness]]es trying to expand their holdings and react to market incentives, and government-backed investments, especially from the Gulf states, as a result of fears surrounding national [[food security]].&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt;

Agricultural sector companies most often view investment in land as an opportunity to leverage their significant monetary resources and [[market access]] to take advantage of underused land, diversify their holdings, and vertically integrate their production systems. The [[World Bank]] identifies three areas in which multinational companies can leverage economies of scale: access to cheap international rather than domestic [[capital market|financial markets]], risk-reducing [[diversification (finance)|diversification of holdings]], and greater ability to address [[infrastructure|infrastructural]] roadblocks.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; In the past few decades, [[multinational company|multinationals]] have shied away from direct involvement in relatively unprofitable [[primary production]], instead focusing on inputs and [[food processing|processing]] and distribution.&lt;ref name=Selby&gt;{{cite book |last=Selby |first=A. |title=Institutional Investment into Agricultural Activities: Potential Benefits and Pitfalls|year=2009|publisher=Presented at the conference "Land Governance in support of the MDGs: responding to New Challenges," World Bank|location=Washington D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the food price crisis hit, risk was transferred from primary production to the price-sensitive processing and distribution fields, and returns became concentrated in primary production. This has incentivized agribusinesses to vertically integrate to reduce supplier risk that has been heightened by the ongoing food price volatility.&lt;ref name="Cotula et al." /&gt; These companies hold mixed attitudes towards food imports and exports: While some concentrate on food exports, others focus on domestic markets first.

While company-originated investments have originated from a wide range of countries, government-backed investments have originated primarily from the food-insecure Gulf States. Examples of such government-backed investments include the government of [[Qatar]]’s attempt to secure land in the [[Tana River District|Tana River Delta]] and the [[Saudi]] government's King Abdullah Initiative.&lt;ref name="Cotula Outlook"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cotula |first=Lorenzo|title=The outlook on farmland acquisitions |year=2011|publisher=International Land Coalition, IIED |url=http://www.landcoalition.org/publications/outlook-farmland-acquisitions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FIAN 2010"&gt;{{cite book|title=Land grabbing in Kenya and Mozambique |year=2010 |publisher=FIAN |url=http://www.fian.org/resources/documents/others/land-grabbing-in-kenya-and-mozambique}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[sovereign wealth fund]]s acting as the investments arms of governments have initiated a number of agreements in Sub-Saharan Africa. Since the population of the Gulf states is set to double from 30 million in 2000 to 60 million in 2030, their reliance on food imports is set to increase from the current level of 60% of consumption.&lt;ref name=Woertz&gt;{{cite news|last=Woertz |first=E. |title=Gulf food security needs delicate diplomacy |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d916f8e2-08d8-11de-b8b0-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1|accessdate=22 August 2011 |newspaper=Financial Times |date=4 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director general of the Arab Organisation for Agricultural Development echoed the sentiment of many Gulf leaders in proclaiming, “the whole Arab World needs of cereal, sugar, fodder and other essential foodstuffs could be met by Sudan alone.”&lt;ref name="Cotula et al." /&gt;

=== Biofuels ===
[[Biofuel]] production, currently comprising 21% of total land investments, has played a significant, if at times unclear, role. The use and popularity of biofuels has grown over the past decade, corresponding with rising [[oil price]]s and increased [[environmental awareness]]. The total area under biofuel crops more than doubled between 2004 and 2008, expanding to 36 million ha by 2008.&lt;ref name="UNEP 2009"&gt;{{cite book|title=Towards sustainable production and use of resources assessing biofuels|year=2009|publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rise in popularity culminated in [[Renewable Energy Directive|EU Directive 2009/28/EC]] in April 2009, which set 10% mandatory targets for renewable energy use, primarily biofuels, out of the total consumption of fuel for transport, by 2020.&lt;ref name="Graham et al."&gt;{{cite book |last=Graham|first=Alison|title=The Impact of Europe's Policies and Practices on African Agriculture and Food Security |year=2010 |publisher=FIAN|url=http://www.fian.org/resources/documents/others/report-on-land-grabbing/pdf|author2=Sylvain Aubry |author3=Rolf Künnemann |author4=Sofia Suarez }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taken as a whole, the rise in biofuels popularity, while perhaps beneficial for the environment, sparked a chain reaction by making biofuels production a more attractive than food production and drawing land away from food to biofuel production.

The effect of the rise in popularity in biofuels was two-fold: first, demand for land for biofuel production became a primary driver of land sales in Sub-Saharan Africa; second, demand for biofuels production crowded out supply of traditional food crops worldwide. By crowding out food crops and forcing conversion of existing food-producing land to biofuels, biofuels production had a direct impact on the [[food supply]]/demand balance and consequently the food price crisis. One researcher from the [[International Food Policy Research Institute|IFPRI]] estimated that biofuels had accounted for 30 percent of the increase in weighted average grain prices.&lt;ref name=Rosegrant&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosegrant|first=Mark|title=Biofuels and Grain Prices: Impacts and Policy Responses|year=2008|publisher=Testimony for US Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Large-scale investments in land since 2007 have been scrutinized by civil society organizations, researchers, and other organizations because of issues such as [[land insecurity]], local consultation and compensation for land, [[development-induced displacement|displacement]] of local peoples, employment of local people, the process of negotiations between investors and governments, and the environmental consequences of [[industrial agriculture|large-scale agriculture]]. These issues have contributed to critics' characterization of much large-scale investment since 2007 as "land grabbing," irrespective of differences in the types of investments and the ultimate impact that investments have on local populations.&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt;

=== Land insecurity ===
One of the major issues is [[land tenure]]: In a 2003 study, the World Bank estimated that only between 2 and 10 percent of total land in Africa is formally tenured.&lt;ref name="Cotula et al." /&gt; Much of the lack of private ownership is due to government ownership of land as a function of national policy, and also because of complicated procedures for registration of land and a perception by communities that customary systems are sufficient.&lt;ref name="Cotula et al." /&gt; World Bank researchers have found that there existed a strong negative statistical link between land tenure recognition and prospective land acquisitions, with a smaller yet still significant relationship for implemented projects as well.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; They concluded that “lower recognition of land rights increased a country’s attractiveness for land acquisition,” implying that companies have actively sought out areas with low land recognition rights for investment.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt;

=== Local consultation and compensation ===
While commonly required by law in many host countries, the consultation process between investors and local populations have been criticized for not adequately informing communities of their rights, negotiating powers, and entitlements within land transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, F. (2012). The land grabbers: The new fight over who owns the Earth. Boston: Beacon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consultations have been found extremely problematic due to the fact that they often reach just village chiefs but neglect common villagers and disenfranchised groups. World Bank researchers noted that “a key finding from case studies is that communities were rarely aware of their [[land rights|rights]] and, even in cases where they were, lacked the ability to interact with investors or to explore ways to use their land more productively.”&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; When consultations were even conducted, they often did not produce written agreements and were found to be superficial, glossing over environmental and social issues.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; In Ghana and elsewhere, chiefs often negotiated directly with investors without the input from other villagers, taking it upon themselves to sell common land or village land on their own.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; Moreover, investors often had obtained approval for their projects before beginning consultations, and lacked any contractual obligation to carry out promises made to villagers.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt;

There is a [[knowledge gap]] between investors and local populations regarding the land acquisition process, the [[legal enforceability]] of promises made by investors, and other issues. The inability of villagers to see and study the laws and regulations around land sales severely deteriorates communities’ agency in consultations. When consultations do occur with communities, some take place in spans of only two to three months, casting doubt on whether such short time frames can be considered as adequate consultation for such large, wide-reaching, and impactful events.&lt;ref name="Cotula Outlook" /&gt;

An additional concern with consultations is that [[women]] and underrepresented populations are often left outside during the process. Large-scale projects in [[Mozambique]] rarely included women in consultations and never presented official reports and documents for authorization by women.&lt;ref name="Nhantumbo Salomao"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nhantumbo|first=I.|title=Biofuels, land access and rural livelihoods in Mozambique |year=2010|publisher=IIED |location=London |url=http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/12563IIED.pdf|author2=A. Salomao }}&lt;/ref&gt; This holds true when women are the primary workers on the land that is to be leased out to companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Duvane |first=L|title=Mozambique Case Study |year=2010 |publisher=2010 Institute for Poverty Land and Agrarian Studies: Regional Workshop on Commercialization of Land in Southern Africa|location=Cape Town}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, pastoralists and internally displaced people were oftentimes intentionally excluded from negotiations, as investors tried to delegitimize their claims on land.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; This led to a lack of awareness on the part of these vulnerable groups until lease agreements have already been signed to transfer land. This oversight in consultations further disenfranchises previously overlooked communities and worsens power inequities in local villages.

===Displacement===
Another criticism of investment in land is the potential for large-scale [[development-induced displacement|displacement]] of local peoples without adequate [[Financial compensation|compensation]], in either land or money. These displacements often result in [[Population transfer|resettlement]] in marginal lands, loss of livelihoods especially in the case of [[pastoralism|pastoralists]], gender-specific erosion of social networks.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Villagers were most often compensated as according to national guidelines for loss of land, loss of improvements over time on the land, and sometimes future [[harvest]]s.&lt;ref name="Cotula et al." /&gt; However, compensation guidelines vary significantly between countries and depending on the types of projects undertaken. One study by the [[International Institute for Environment and Development|IIED]] concluded that guidelines for compensation given to displaced villagers in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Ghana]] was insufficient to restore livelihoods lost through dislocation.&lt;ref name="Cotula et al." /&gt;

There are a number of issues with the process of relocating locals to other areas where land is less [[soil fertility|fertile]]. In the process of relocation, often changed or lost are historical methods of farming, existing [[social ties]], sources of income, and livelihoods. This holds drastic impacts especially in the case of women, who rely greatly upon such informal relationships.&lt;ref name="Behrman et al."&gt;{{cite book|last=Behrman |first=Julia|title=The Gender Implications of Large-Scale Land Deals |year=2011|publisher=IFPRI |url=http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ifpridp01056.pdf |author2=Ruth Meinzen-Dick |author3=Agnes Quisumbing }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employment ===
When not displaced, the conversion of local farmers into [[laborer]]s holds numerous negative consequences for local populations. Most deals are based on the eventual formation of plantation-style farming, whereupon the investing company will own the land and employ locals as laborers in large-scale agricultural plots. The number of jobs created varies greatly dependent on commodity type and style of farming planned.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; In spite of this volatility, guarantees of [[job creation]] are rarely, if ever, addressed in contracts. This fact, combined with the intrinsic incentives towards mechanization in [[plantation]]-style production, can lead to much lower employment than originally planned for. When employed, locals are often [[underpaid|paid little]]: In investments by [[Karuturi Global]] in Ethiopia, workers are paid on average under $2 a day, with a minimum wage of 8 [[Ethiopian birr|birr]], or $0.48, per day, both of which are under the World Bank [[poverty limit]] of $2 per day.&lt;ref name=McLure&gt;{{cite news|last=McLure|first=Jason| title=Ethiopian Farms Lure Investor Funds as Workers Live in Poverty |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aeuJT_pSE68c# |accessdate=22 August 2011|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government negotiations ===
In addition to the lack of coordination between ministries, there is a wide knowledge gap between government-level offices and investors, leading to a rushed and superficial investment review. Many government agencies initially overwhelmed by the deluge of investment proposals failed to properly screen out non-viable proposals.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; Due to the knowledge gaps between government agencies and investors, “in most countries it is implicitly presumed that investors will have the right incentive and be the best qualified to assess [[economic viability]],” leading to a lack of reporting requirements or monitoring arrangements, key information on land uses and value of the investment, and checks on economic viability.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; The Sudanese government has been noted as having paid minimal attention to existing land rights and neglecting to conduct any economic analysis on potential projects.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt; In addition, many countries, including Cambodia, Congo, Sudan, and Ghana, have neglected to catalog and file even general geographical descriptions of land allocation boundaries.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt;

One addition to many contracts between governments and investors is a Stabilisation Clause, which insulates investors from the effect of changed governmental regulations. Such clauses severely restrict the government’s ability to change any regulations that would have a negative economic impact on the investment.&lt;ref name="Cotula et al." /&gt; While advantageous for businesses, these stabilization clauses would severely hinder the ability of governments to address possible social and/or environmental concerns that become apparent after the beginning of the project.

=== Environmental impact ===
Land investment has been criticized for its implicit endorsement of large-scale [[industrial agriculture]], which relies heavily on costly machinery, [[fertilizer]]s, [[pesticide]]s, and other inputs, over smallholder agriculture.&lt;ref name=Magdoff-MR-2013-11&gt;[http://monthlyreview.org/2013/11/01/twenty-first-century-land-grabs/ Twenty-First-Century Land Grabs] (November 2013), Fred Magdoff, ''[[Monthly Review]],'' Volume 65, Issue 06&lt;/ref&gt;   As foreign investors begin to develop the land, they will, for the most part, start a shift towards [[industrial agriculture|large-scale agriculture]] to improve upon existing “unproductive” agricultural methods. The threat of the conversion of much of Africa’s land to such large-scale agriculture has provoked a severe pushback from many civil society organizations such as [[GRAIN]], [[La Via Campesina]], and other lobbyists for small-scale agriculture.&lt;ref name="Protest FIAN GRAIN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fian.org/fileadmin/media/publications/2010_04_StopLandgrabbingNow.pdf|title=Stop Land Grabbing Now!|publisher=FIAN, LRAN, GRAIN|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign investors, through large-scale agriculture, increase the effectiveness of underused resources of land, labor, and water, while further providing additional market connections, large-scale infrastructure development, and provision of seeds, fertilizers, and technology. Proposed increases in production quantity, as touted by investors and hosts, are exemplified by Ethiopia’s Abera Deressa, who claims that “foreign investors should help boost agricultural output by as much as 40%” throughout Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="Butler 2010" /&gt; However, large-scale mechanized agricultural production often entails the use of fertilizers and [[intensive farming]] techniques that have been criticized by numerous civil society actors as extremely [[ecological health|ecologically detrimental]] and [[environmental damage|environmentally harmful]] over the long run.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balehegn|first=Mulubrhan|date=2015-03-04|title=Unintended Consequences: The Ecological Repercussions of Land Grabbing in Sub-Saharan Africa|journal=Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development|volume=57|issue=2|pages=4–21|doi=10.1080/00139157.2015.1001687|issn=0013-9157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GRAIN 2008"&gt;{{cite news|title=Seized: The 2008 land grab for food and financial security|url=http://www.grain.org/article/entries/93-seized-the-2008-landgrab-for-food-and-financial-security|accessdate=22 August 2011|newspaper=GRAIN|date=24 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over time, such intensive farming threatens to degrade the quality of topsoil and damage local waterways and ecosystems. As such, civil society actors have widely accused land investors for promoting “not agricultural development, much less rural development, but simply agribusiness development.”&lt;ref name="GRAIN 2008" /&gt; This trend towards large-scale agriculture that overrides local knowledge and [[sustainable]] local farming runs directly counter to the recent [[IAASTD]] report, backed by the [[FAO]], [[UNDP]], World Bank, and others, that to increase [[food security]] over the long term, sustainable peasant agriculture must be encouraged and supported.&lt;ref name=IAASTD&gt;{{cite book|title=Agriculture at Crossroads: International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development, Science, and Technology |year=2008 |publisher=IAASTD|url=http://www.agassessment.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neocolonialism ===
Foreign investment in land has been criticized by many civil society actors and individuals as a new realization of [[neocolonialism]], signifying a renewed economic imperialism of developed over developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vidal|first=John|title=Fears for the world's poor countries as the rich grab land to grow food |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jul/03/land-grabbing-food-environment|accessdate=22 August 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 July 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have pointed to the acquisitions of large tracts of land for economic profit, with little perceived benefit for local populations or target nations as a whole, as a renewal of the economically exploitative practices of the colonial period.

==Laws and Regulations Concerning Reporting of Foreign Investment in Land==

A 2013 report found no available literature giving recommendations for how the UK could change its laws and regulations to require UK companies investing in land in developing countries to report relevant data.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a"&gt;Walton, O., 2013, [http://partnerplatform.org/?0pj89g19 Laws and Regulations Concerning Reporting of Foreign Investment in Land, Economic and Private Sector Professional Evidence And Applied Knowledge Services]&lt;/ref&gt;

The researcher looks at a literature review by [[Global Witness]], the [[Oakland Institute]], and the [[International Land Coalition]] from 2012 which states that there is little sustained focus on the extraterritorial obligations of states over overseas business enterprises.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="globalwitness"&gt;Global Witness, Oakland Institute, International Land Coalition, 2012, [http://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/library/Dealing_with_disclosure_1.pdf Dealing with Disclosure: Improving Transparency in Decision-Making over Large Scale Land Acquisitions, Allocations and Investments]&lt;/ref&gt;

The researcher found most available literature and policy on transparency in land investment focusing on:
*Facilitating community engagement in planning decisions and enhancing community rights
*Upgrading obligations/capacities of host governments to improve regulation of foreign-funded land deals.
*Developing international frameworks to improve transparency in land deals.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;

He found this focus was confirmed by a range of other documents reviewing address international efforts to promote responsible investment in agriculture and recommended the International Working Group paper&lt;ref&gt;International Working Group on the Food Security Pillar of the G20 Multi-Year Action Plan on Development (2011) ‘Options for Promoting Responsible Investment in Agriculture’, Report to the High-Level Development Working Group http://archive.unctad.org/sections/dite_dir/docs//diae_dir_2011-06_G20_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
and Smaller &amp; Mann.&lt;ref&gt;Smaller, C. and Mann, H. (2009) ‘A Thirst for Distant Lands: Foreign investment in agricultural
land and water’, International Institute for Sustainable Development http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/est/INTERNATIONAL-TRADE/FDIs/A_Thirst_for_distant_lands.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The researcher mentions a report by the [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] stating a ‘significant lack of concrete and verifiable’ empirically-based policy and legal work on the issue of foreign investment in agricultural land&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smaller, C. and Mann, H., 2009, pp2, ‘A Thirst for Distant Lands: Foreign investment in agricultural
land and water’, International Institute for Sustainable Development http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/est/INTERNATIONAL-TRADE/FDIs/A_Thirst_for_distant_lands.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The researcher saw Smaller and Mann&lt;ref&gt;Smaller, C. and Mann, H., 2009, pp8, ‘A Thirst for Distant Lands: Foreign investment in agricultural
land and water’, International Institute for Sustainable Development http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/est/INTERNATIONAL-TRADE/FDIs/A_Thirst_for_distant_lands.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; note that in many host states like the UK ‘there is either no, or insufficient or unclear domestic law concerning land rights, water rights, pollution controls for intensive agriculture, human health, worker protection and so on.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;

The researcher did find that international law framework provides hard rights for foreign investors with two primary sources of international law relating to this issue: [[international contracts]], which are commercial in nature; and [[international treaty law]] on investment, with both bodies acting on a commercial perspective and focusing on economic interests of foreign investors, rather than social or environmental dimensions&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smaller, C. and Mann, H., 2009, ‘A Thirst for Distant Lands: Foreign investment in agricultural land and water’, International Institute for Sustainable Development http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/est/INTERNATIONAL-TRADE/FDIs/A_Thirst_for_distant_lands.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

He discussed the UN’s Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights&lt;ref name="business-humanrights"&gt;UN (2011) ‘Report of the Special Representative of the Secretary General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, John Ruggie’, Human Rights Council Seventeenth session Agenda item 3 Promotion and protection of all human rights, civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development, A/HRC/17/31
http://www.business-humanrights.org/media/documents/ruggie/ruggie-guiding-principles-21-mar-2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which address the extraterritorial obligations of states over overseas business enterprises and finds the principles do not provide any detailed discussion of the UK case, or of timeframes and costs.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;

===Extraterritorial obligations of states over overseas businesses===

The researcher studied a report by [[Global Witness]], the [[Oakland Institute]] and the [[International Land Coalition]] which identifies four key entry points for improving transparency in large-scale land acquisition:&lt;ref name="globalwitness" /&gt;
*transparent land and natural resource planning;
*free, prior and ‘informed’ consent;
*public disclosure of all contractual documentation;
*multi-stakeholder initiatives, independent oversight and grievance mechanisms’
*a range of additional entry points for future policy work and campaigning, which includes addressing the ‘extra-territorial obligations of states over overseas business enterprises’.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;

He found the report stresses that ‘further analysis is needed to identify the benefits and opportunities of each entry point, as well as potential limitations, challenges, and risks around future campaigns which would need to be addressed from the start’ and notes that as of early 2013 there is a gap between the extent to which individual states fulfill their obligations to regulate businesses overseas, and ‘the extent to which such regulations cover transparency and information disclosure’&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Global Witness, Oakland Institute, International Land Coalition, 2012, pp48 ‘Dealing with Disclosure: Improving Transparency in Decision-Making over Large Scale Land Acquisitions, Allocations and Investments’, Global Witness, Oakland Institute, International Land Coalition http://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/library/Dealing_with_disclosure_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The researcher found that the UN’s Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights, written by the former UN Special Representative to the Secretary General for Business and Human Rights, Professor John Ruggie&lt;ref name="business-humanrights" /&gt;  provide some discussion of how business enterprises need to undertake human rights due diligence suggesting that states ‘should set out clearly the expectation that all business enterprises domiciled in their territory and/or jurisdiction respect human rights throughout their operations’ and notes that ‘at present States are not generally required under international human rights law to regulate the extraterritorial activities of businesses domiciled in their territory and/or jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;

He claims that they are not generally prohibited from doing so either, provided there is a recognised jurisdictional basis’&lt;ref&gt;UN (2011) pp7 ‘Report of the Special Representative of the Secretary General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, John Ruggie’, Human Rights Council Seventeenth session Agenda item 3 Promotion and protection of all human rights, civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development, A/HRC/17/31
http://www.business-humanrights.org/media/documents/ruggie/ruggie-guiding-principles-21-mar-2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  and says the report notes that some states have introduced domestic measures with extraterritorial implications. ‘Examples include requirements on “parent” companies to report on the global operations of the entire enterprise; multilateral soft-law instruments such as the Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development; and performance standards required by institutions that support overseas investments.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;

The researcher found other approaches amount to direct extraterritorial legislation and enforcement including criminal regimes that allow for prosecutions based on the nationality of the perpetrator no matter where the offence occurs’&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UN (2011), pp7, ‘Report of the Special Representative of the Secretary General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, John Ruggie’, Human Rights Council Seventeenth session Agenda item 3 Promotion and protection of all human rights, civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development, A/HRC/17/31
http://www.business-humanrights.org/media/documents/ruggie/ruggie-guiding-principles-21-mar-2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

He read that the UN’s Guiding Principles&lt;ref name="business-humanrights" /&gt;  propose that ‘contracts should always be publicly disclosed when the public interest is impacted; namely cases where the project presents either large-scale or significant social, economic, or environmental risks or opportunities, or involves the depletion of renewable or non-renewable natural resources’&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Global Witness, Oakland Institute, International Land Coalition, 2012, pp30 ‘Dealing with Disclosure: Improving Transparency in Decision-Making over Large Scale Land Acquisitions, Allocations and Investments’, Global Witness, Oakland Institute, International Land Coalition http://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/library/Dealing_with_disclosure_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

He found Global Witness et al.&lt;ref name="globalwitness" /&gt; state that governments and businesses often claim that confidentiality is necessarily to protect commercially sensitive information contained in investment contracts.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;

===Other relevant international Principles, Guidelines and Instruments===

The researcher states that the Global Witness et al. paper&lt;ref&gt;Global Witness, Oakland Institute, International Land Coalition, 2012, pp12 ‘Dealing with Disclosure: Improving Transparency in Decision-Making over Large Scale Land Acquisitions, Allocations and Investments’, Global Witness, Oakland Institute, International Land Coalition http://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/library/Dealing_with_disclosure_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; details a number of international instruments that ‘create obligations and responsibilities throughout all stages of decision-making around large-scale land investments’,  including the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]; the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]; and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;

He found several thematic binding agreements also examined in the report: the 1992 [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] and the 1994 [[Convention to Combat Desertification]].&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;

The UK encourages companies to abide by OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises which provide voluntary principles and standards for responsible business conduct for multinational corporations operating in or from countries adhering to the OECD Declaration on International Investment and Multinational Enterprises, including detailed guidance concerning information disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;OECD (2011) ‘OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises’, 2011 Edition, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. http://www.oecd.org/daf/internationalinvestment/guidelinesformultinationalenterprises/48004323.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However they do not, provide any specific recommendations on land.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;

The researcher read the Global Witness et al.&lt;ref name="globalwitness" /&gt; report also finds that ‘a number of instruments offer companies the opportunity to associate themselves with a set of principles or goals that demonstrate [[corporate social responsibility]]’ but most of these are largely ‘declarative’.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;

Overall, he summaries that the report notes that although these various instruments ‘recognise secrecy and lack of access to information to be a problem, they give almost no detail as to how it should be tackled in practice, nor do any mandatory provisions yet exist to ensure such an implicit aspiration is met’&lt;ref name="partnerplatform_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Global Witness, Oakland Institute, International Land Coalition, 2012, pp19 ‘Dealing with Disclosure: Improving Transparency in Decision-Making over Large Scale Land Acquisitions, Allocations and Investments’, Global Witness, Oakland Institute, International Land Coalition http://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/library/Dealing_with_disclosure_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Information issues ==
In a joint research project between the FAO, IIED, and IFAD, Cotula et al. found that the majority of host countries lacked basic data on the size, nature, and location of land acquisitions through land registries or other public sources, and that “researchers needed to make multiple contacts…to access even superficial and incomplete information.”&lt;ref name="Cotula et al." /&gt; The World Bank’s own lack of land size information on over half of the reported land grabs that it researched points to the difficulties inherent in gaining access to and researching individual land acquisitions.&lt;ref name=Deininger/&gt;

The European project [http://www.ejolt.org/ EJOLT] (Environmental Justice Organisations, Liabilities and Trade) is building a global map of land grabbing, with the aim to make an interactive online map on this and many other environmental justice issue by 2013. The project also produces in-depth resources on land grabbing, such as [http://www.ejolt.org/2011/10/ejolt-video-on-landgrabbing-in-gambela/ this video on land grabbing in Ethiopia].

== Notable cases ==
In Madagascar, the anger among the population about land sales led to violent protests. The South Korean corporation Daewoo was in the process of negotiations with the Malagasy government for the purchase of 1.3 million hectares, half of all agricultural land, to produce corn and palm oil. This investment, while one of many pursued in Madagascar, attracted considerable attention there and led to protests against the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stwr.org/food-security-agriculture/land-grabbing-the-end-of-sustainable-agriculture.html |title=Land Grabbing: the End of Sustainable Agriculture? |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sudan, numerous large-scale land acquisitions have taken place in spite of the country's unresolved political and security situation. One of the most prominent, involving a former GRAPE partner named [[Ilip Cybourg]], garnered attention by playing in ''Rolling Stone''. Ilip, who is planning to invest in 800,000 ha of land in partnership with many of Sudan's top civilian officials, attracted criticism with his remarks (regarding Africa and land grabbing) that "the whole place is like one big sewer &amp;mdash; and I'm like a plumber."&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"&gt;{{cite news|last=Funk|first=McKenzie|title=Meet the New Capitalists of Chaos |url=http://news.haverford.edu/blogs/ourschool/files/2010/06/Capitalists-of-Chaos-Mckenzie-Funk.pdf|accessdate=22 August 2011|newspaper=Rolling Stone|date=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1969, nine African-Americans met in New York City to discuss the unique challenges and limited opportunities they faced in the accounting profession. In that year, there were only 136 African-American Certified Public Accountants (CPA's) out of a total of 100,000 in the United States.

This group wanted to establish an organization to address the concerns of minorities entering the accounting profession and to make a commitment to professional and academic excellence. The following nine individuals who met that month were determined to "make a difference" and let their voices be heard.
The '''National Association of Black Accountants''' (NABA, Inc.), is an American nonprofit [[professional association]] that represents the interests of more than 200,000 [[black professionals]] in furthering their educational and professional goals in [[accounting]], finance, and related business professions. Student members are served throughout the organization’s 200 chapters around the country. NABA’s membership includes entry and mid-level accountants, auditors and financial professional, senior-level managers and executives, [[partner (business rank)|firm partners]], as well accounting, finance, business, and IT students. About half of NABA’s members work in corporate America, with the remainder serving in nonprofit, government, academic, and international arenas. Forty percent hold advanced degrees and 45% hold professional certifications. NABA is also made up of corporate members who represent hundreds of African American-owned CPA firms around the country.

==Mission==

NABA’s motto is “Lifting As We Climb,” which is embodied in its official logo depicting two interlocked hands, with one pulling the other up. The image denotes both the political struggle the organization faced at its founding and the goal of helping future generations of accounting professionals. The organization came into existence during a period of time in which blacks and other minorities faced obstacles in being recognized and being promoted in the profession. It became a vehicle through which minority professionals could be assisted as they climbed the corporate ladder, obtained the [[Certified Public Accountant]] (CPA) designation, and prepared for partnership in top firms. Moreover, the organization’s operating model encourages veteran professionals to incubate and mentor students entering the profession.

Through a number of programs and partnerships with like-minded organizations, conferences, publications, as well as advocacy, NABA aims to:
* Promote and develop the professional skills of members
* Groom college students entering the accounting profession and attract younger students to the profession
* Provide opportunities for members to fulfill their civic responsibilities
* Promote public confidence in members, their credentials, and the professional services they provide
* Represent the interests of members in educational, political, and social domains
* Ensure long-term financial stability and provide adequate resources for chapter, regional, and national programs

==Organizational structure==
The association is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit membership organization. There are two classes of membership: student and professional. Professional members may also opt to obtain the Lifetime Member designation. The 160 student chapters are named by their college or university and fall under the auspices of the nearest of the 48 professional chapters. A National Board of Directors, which includes regional leaders, governs the entire organization. The headquarters is in [[Greenbelt, Maryland]].

==History==

NABA was established in 1969 by nine African American accountants in New York City, and for forty years has addressed the systematic challenges faced by minority accounting professionals. In 1969, there were 100,000 people who held the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) designation–only 150 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/professional-scientific/accounting-tax/117988-1.html The Status of the Black CPA: Twenty Five Year Update], ''Journal of Accountancy'', Vol. 170, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; of them were African American. That same year, the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]]—the professional body that awards CPAs—passed a resolution on the lack of diversity in the accounting profession and established the Minority Initiative Committee, which along with NABA, continues to study and provide solutions that eliminate the barriers to success in the profession by people of color.  Today, through the efforts of NABA, the AICPA, and other interested groups, there are more than 200,000 African Americans participating in the field of accounting, of which more than 5,000 are CPAs.

As a leader in the business community, NABA continues to create opportunities to enlarge the pipeline of African Americans into every level of accounting and finance, as it recognizes that the growth of the blacks in the profession remains a significant challenge. Minorities make up slightly more than 25%&lt;ref&gt;[http://ceae.aicpa.org/NR/rdonlyres/F04B2134-7E2B-45C9-8D71-A0D3FB68483C/0/2009_TrendsReport.pdf 2009 Trends in the Supply of Accounting Graduates and the Demand for Public Accounting Recruits], [[AICPA]], 2009&lt;/ref&gt; of enrollments in bachelor’s degree programs: 11.5% [[African American]], 7% Asian, 6% [[Hispanic]], 1% American Indian/Alaskan Native, and 6.5% of mixed or unknown ethnicity. At the master’s level, African American enrollment falls to just 6%.

'''Challenges of African Americans in Obtaining the CPA'''

Given the importance of the CPA designation in reaching top levels of the profession, NABA extends significant resources to help its members achieve this mark and to study the factors that impose barriers to obtaining it. In June 2007, NABA, along with Howard University’s Center for Accounting Education, held the first CPA Examination Summit  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nabainc.org/portals/6/docs/nabanews/CPA%20Summit%20White%20Paper%20Insights.pdf 2007 CPA Examination Summit: Insights into Increasing the Number of African American CPAs], NABA, Inc. and [[Howard University]] Center for Accounting Education, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; at NABA’s Annual National Convention. The convening gathered participants from public accounting, industry, and academia to explore why—despite their increasing numbers in college degree programs—growing numbers of African Americans were not sitting for or passing the CPA examination.

The Summit unearthed a number of issues, including generational challenges, lack of black CPA role models, and exam mechanics. A second Summit in 2008 led to the creation of several programs within NABA and other organizations to resolve these issues, with financial support&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nabainc.org/portals/6/docs/nabanews/2008%20CPA%20Examination%20Summit%20White%20Paper-Web-Email.pdf CPA Examination Summit – Insights Into Increasing the Number of African-American CPAs: Part 2], NABA, Inc. and Howard University Center for Accounting Education, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; from accounting firms [[Ernst &amp; Young]] and [[Deloitte]].

==Programs and Initiatives==

NABA’s programs consist of professional development, networking opportunities, job placement, continuing education, technical training, national and regional conferences, and public service initiatives.

* The '''Center for Advancement of Minority Accountants''' (CAMA) recruits, develops, and supports talented minorities interested in accounting, finance, and related business fields through partnerships among NABA chapters, corporations, and colleges and universities.
* '''CPA Bound''' grew out of NABA’s President’s Advisory Council to increase the number of African American CPAs. In concert with Howard University and Becker CPA Review, the program offers an intensive seven-week Boot Camp for young professionals preparing to sit for the CPA exam. CPA Bound also hosts the annual CPA Examination Summit to monitor progress of efforts to increase the number of minorities passing the exam.
* NABA’s '''Accounting Career Awareness Program''' (ACAP) is an annual one-week residency program for high school students to be introduced accounting, finance, and general business concepts.
* For professional members, NABA provides [[continuing professional education]] credits (CPEs) through technical sessions held throughout the year and at the Annual National Convention. NABA is registered with the [[National Association of State Boards of Accountancy]] as an official sponsor of continuing professional education.
* NABA hosts a three-tiered '''Leadership Development Institute''' that helps participants bridge the gap from mid-to-senior-to executive levels of business leadership. The institutes take place in conjunction with NABA’s Annual National Convention.
* Student members of NABA have access to its '''National Scholarship Program''', which has offered more than $7.1 million in support since beginning in 1987. The '''Distinguished Collegian Award''' is the organization’s highest student honor and recognizes NABA students who are making a difference in their chapters and communities. The '''Student Case Study Competition''' is a rigorous challenge between student teams who research, develop, and prepare oral presentations that address accounting and business topics. The competition takes place each year at NABA’s Annual National Convention.
* Community service is an important part of NABA membership. Each year, members take time away from the Annual National Convention and complete an outreach mission as part of NABA’s '''Day of Service'''. It began when NABA’s convention took place in New Orleans in 2009 and will continue in 2010 in Houston. Moreover, NABA professional members annually cosponsor [[IRS Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program]] sites to help low-to-moderate income people prepare their tax returns.
* NABA also partners with the AICPA to bring comprehensive consumer financial literacy education to youth, students, and low-to-moderate income families.

==Conferences==
Each year, the Association hosts five regional conferences in the fall for students. In addition to [[professional development]] sessions, students receive [[scholarship]]s and apply for [[internship]]s. Seniors are scheduled for onsite interviews for employment following graduation. Each June, NABA convenes the general membership for large-scale networking sessions and student development opportunities, leadership training, professional awards, student case competition, the NABA Day of Service, and scholarship awards.

The '''Peruvian Amazon Company''', also called the '''Anglo-Peruvian Amazon Rubber Co''',&lt;ref name=EB1922/&gt; was a [[rubber boom]] company that operated in Peru in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Based in [[Iquitos, Peru|Iquitos]], it became notorious for the ill treatment of its indigenous workers in the Amazon Basin, whom its field forces treated as virtual slaves. The company's practices were exposed in 1913 by the investigative report of British consul-general [[Roger Casement]] and an article and book by journalist [[W. E. Hardenburg]].

The [[Julio César Arana|Arana Brothers]] company, who had sought capital in London, were fused with the PAC in 1907.&lt;ref name=EB1922/&gt;
[[Julio César Arana]] ran the company in Peru.&lt;ref name=merc1/&gt; Its British Board of Directors included [[Kaye baronets|Sir J. Lister Kaye]].&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt;

The company operated in the area of the [[Putumayo River]],&lt;ref name=merc1/&gt; a river that flows from the [[Andes]] to join the [[Amazon River]] deep in the tropical jungle. This area was contested at the time among  [[Peru]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], and it was inhabited by numerous [[Indigenous people of the Americas|indigenous people]].&lt;ref name=EB1922/&gt;

The company participated in abuses and criminal actions against laborers in the area, with its overseers using force and even killing to suppress the workers. An investigative report by Roger Casement, British consul, exposed the abuses, embarrassing British members of the company's board. They put pressure on Arana to improve operations. A movement grew to stop the abuse and eventually led to the end of the company. The Anti-Slavery and Aborigines Protection Society was one of the activist groups working to stop the abuses.&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt;

W. E. Hardenburg wrote a scathing article in the British magazine ''[[Truth (British periodical)|Truth]]''. The British government in 1910 sent the [[consul-general]] [[Roger Casement]] to investigate. His report also denounced the operations of the PAC. A 1912 book by Hardenburg, which contained edited extracts of Casement's report, was described by its editor as "perhaps the most terrible page in the whole history of commercialism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last = Hardenburg |first = W. E. |editor = C. Reginald Enock |year = 1912 |title = The Putumayo: The Devil's Paradise |location = London |publisher = T. Fisher Unwin |at = [https://archive.org/stream/putumayodevilspa00hardrich#page/n9/mode/2up Preface] }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Select Committee of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] published a paper on the investigations in 1913. The British Board of Directors was considered not criminally liable under the [[Slave Trade Act#United Kingdom|Slave Trade Acts]].&lt;ref name=EB1922/&gt; However, the Parliament and others moved to tighten up anti-slavery laws. World War I interrupted this work.&lt;ref name=EB1922/&gt;

Among the findings by the various investigatory parties were widespread [[debt bondage]], [[slavery]], torture, mutilation, and many other crimes in the Amazonian Rubber industry, with the Putumayo area being but one example. Religious leaders such as Manuel Polit, Bishop of Cuenca in Ecuador, denounced these activities and worked to reform the system.&lt;ref name=EB1922/&gt; Organizations such as the Sociedad Pro-Indigena also worked to improve conditions for indigenous workers. The area governments also attempted to implement measures to control the abuses, but it was difficult in the large, sparsely populated countryside, which had few road connections to major cities.&lt;ref name=EB1922/&gt;

Arana was appointed liquidator in September 1911,&lt;ref name=lg&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28539|page=7306|date=6 October 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28539|page=7307|date=6 October 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the company was forced into closure by a judge in 1913.&lt;ref name=merc1/&gt; After the company was closed, the receiver stated that the shareholders would receive nothing, and the creditors would receive small amounts. He blamed the downfall on the British directors,&lt;ref name=advert1/&gt; the Chairman of whom was known as [[J. Russell Gubbins]].&lt;ref name=lg/&gt;

'''Piyasvasti Amranand''' ({{lang-th|ปิยสวัสดิ์ อัมระนันทน์}}; [[Royal Thai General System of Transcription|RTGS:]] Piyasavasti Ammaranan, born 11 July 1953) was [[Thailand]]'s [[Ministry of Energy (Thailand)|Energy Minister]] between 9 October 2006 and 6 February 2008. He is former Secretary-General of the Thai National Energy Policy Office, Chairman of Kasikorn Asset Management, and Chairman of Panel of Advisors for the CEO of [[Kasikornbank]]. He was President of [[Thai Airways International]] between October 2009 and June 2012. He is Chairman of [[PTT Public Company Limited]], board member of Kasikorn Bank, and board member of Pruksa Holding public company limited. Piyasvasti also plays active roles in three non-profit organizations as founding and core member of the Energy Reform for Sustainability Group (ERS); Chairman of the Energy for Environment Foundation, a non-profit organization undertaking renewable energy and energy efficiency projects; and as president of the Ski and Snowboard Association of Thailand.

==Career==
During the 1990s, Piyasvasti played a key role in deregulating and privatizing a number of energy-related state enterprises like [[PTT Public Company Limited|PTT]] and power generation business. During his term as energy minister he implemented wide-ranging reforms in the energy sector, for instance, the end of oil price subsidies and repayment of the oil fund's massive debt due to the previous government's subsidy program; implementation of very aggressive policy to promote renewable energy (including biofuels), cogeneration and [[distributed generation]]; adoption of Euro 4 fuel qualities and introduction of vapour recovery systems for petrol stations; adoption of a number of standards and incentive programs for energy efficiency; awards of a large number of petroleum concessions, issuing of IPP solicitation; conclusion of a number of [[power purchase agreements]] for projects in Lao PDR; establishment of nuclear power program with a target for 4,000 MW of nuclear capacity in 2020-21; and amendment of a number of energy related laws.

The most important law passed during his term as energy minister was the Energy Industry Act to establish an independent regulatory body for electricity and natural gas. The law was also the most important factor which saved PTT Public Co, Ltd from being nationalized in a court case brought against the government and PTT by the Consumers Association.

He joined [[Thai Airways]] in October 2009 when the carrier was in financial trouble. He continued to implement the turnaround plan and introduced a long term strategic plan where the financial position of the company was substantially strengthened, embarked on the largest aircraft acquisition and retrofit program ever implemented at Thai Airways, and formed [[Thai Smile]] as an initial step to compete with low cost airlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mackey|first1=Michael|title=Thai Airways removes president|url=http://atwonline.com/news/thai-airways-removes-president|accessdate=3 February 2016|work=Air Transport World|date=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Piyasvasti was born in 1953, and graduated from [[Brasenose College]], Oxford in 1975 with BA (first class honours) in mathematics. He later obtained MSc in [[econometrics]] and mathematical economics and a PhD in economics from the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Profile: Piyasvasti Amranand PhD|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=11869569&amp;privcapId=874610|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=4 August 2016}}{{verification failed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mondi SCP.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Paper mill [[Mondi]] in [[Ružomberok]], [[Slovakia]].]]
The '''pulp and paper industry''' comprises companies that use [[wood]] as raw material and produce [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]], [[paper]], [[paperboard]] and other cellulose-based products.

==The manufacturing process==

==Paper==
{{Main article|Paper machine|papermaking}}
[[File:Fourdrinier.svg|thumb|Diagram showing the sections of the Fourdrinier machine.]]

The [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]] is fed to a paper machine where it is formed as a paper web and the water is removed from it by pressing and drying.

Pressing the sheet removes the water by force. Once the water is forced from the sheet, a special kind of felt, which is not to be confused with the traditional one, is used to collect the water. Whereas, when making paper by hand, a blotter sheet is used instead.

Drying involves using air or heat to remove water from the paper sheets. In the earliest days of paper making, this was done by hanging the sheets like laundry. In more modern times, various forms of heated drying mechanisms are used. On the paper machine, the most common is the steam heated can dryer.

==Pulp==
{{Main article|Pulp (paper)#Manufacture of wood pulp}}

==History of the paper industry==
The commercial planting of domesticated mulberry trees to make pulp for papermaking is attested as early as the 6th century.&lt;ref name="Tsien58"&gt;{{Citation |last=Tsien |first=Tsuen-Hsuin |authorlink=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin|series=Science and Civilisation in China: Chemistry and Chemical Technology |volume=Vol. 5 Part 1|title=Paper and Printing|publisher=Cambridge University Press|p=58|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to advances in printing technology, the Chinese paper industry continued to grow under the [[Song dynasty]] to meet the rising demand for printed books. Demand for paper was also stimulated by the Song government, which needed a large supply of paper for printing [[paper money]] and exchange certificates.&lt;ref name="Tsien48"&gt;{{Citation |last=Tsien |first=Tsuen-Hsuin |authorlink=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin|series=Science and Civilisation in China: Chemistry and Chemical Technology |volume=Vol. 5 Part 1|title=Paper and Printing|publisher=Cambridge University Press|p=48|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first mechanised paper machine was installed at [[Frogmore Paper Mill]], [[Apsley, Hertfordshire]] in 1803, followed by another in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, Richard, "Papermaking in Britain 1488–1988", Athlone Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The site operates currently as a museum. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thepapertrail.org.uk/|title= The Paper Trail at Frogmore Mill |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= Apsley Paper Trail charity|access-date=2 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental effects==
{{Main article|Environmental impact of paper}}

The pulp and paper industry has been criticized by environmental groups like the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] for unsustainable [[deforestation]] and [[clearcutting]] of [[old-growth forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NRDC: Paper Industry Laying Waste to North American Forests|url = http://www.nrdc.org/land/forests/tissue.asp|website = www.nrdc.org|access-date = 19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry trend is to expand globally to countries like [[Russia]], [[China]] and [[Indonesia]] with low wages and low environmental oversight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A crumpling paper industry|url = http://portlandtribune.com/component/content/article?id=4568|website = Oregon Local News|access-date = 19 February 2016|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Greenpeace]], farmers in [[Deforestation in Central America|Central America]] illegally rip up vast tracts of native forest for cattle and [[soybean]] production without any consequences,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Amazon draught speeds up destruction       The WE News Archives|url = http://www.thewe.cc/weplanet/news/forests/amazon_destruction_speeds_up.htm|website = www.thewe.cc|access-date = 19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and companies who buy timber from private land owners contribute to massive [[deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Brazil forms 'crisis cabinet' following unexpected deforestation surge|url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/20/brazil-crisis-cabinet-amazon-deforestation|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 20 May 2011|access-date = 19 February 2016|issn = 0261-3077|language = en-GB|first = Tom|last = Phillips}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand the situation is quite different where forest growth has been on the increase for a number of years. It is estimated for instance that since 1990 forests have grown in Europe by a [https://twitter.com/CEPI_Paper/status/844106331019759617 size equivalent to that of Switzerland (44,160 KM)] which has been supported through the practice of sustainable forest management by the industry. In Sweden, for every tree that is felled, two are planted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/opinion/lulucf-will-the-eu-turn-the-tide-on-forest-growth-in-europe-and-torpedo-its-bioeconomy-agenda/|title=Will the EU turn the tide on forest growth and torpedo its bioeconomy agenda?|work=euractiv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current production volumes and sales==
The industry is dominated by [[North America]]n ([[United States]] and [[Canada]]), [[northern Europe]]an ([[Finland]], [[Sweden]], and [[North-West Russia]]) and [[East Asia]]n countries (such as East Siberian Russia, [[China]], [[Japan]], and [[South Korea]]). [[Australasia]] and [[Brazil]] also have significant pulp and paper enterprises. The industry also has a significant presence in a number of European countries including Germany, Portugal, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland. The United States had been the world's leading producer of paper until it was overtaken by China in 2009.&lt;ref name=Pulitzer&gt;{{cite web|last=De Sisti|first=Mike|title=China's Paper Operation|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/china-paper-industry-trees-nursery-center-operation-tissue-technology-economy|publisher=Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting|accessdate=13 April 2013|date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4086">The federal Small Business Health Options Program is an insurance exchange, created by [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (Obamacare). &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/health/popular-small-business-health-care-program-may-change-expand/article_dddc4ed4-79bd-11e4-a046-9fa09e151950.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Marketplace helps small businesses to provide health coverage to their employees. Therefore, it is open to employers with 50 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (FTEs), in which it also includes non-profit organizations. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.healthcare.gov/small-businesses/provide-shop-coverage/shop-marketplace-overview/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[HealthCare.gov]], the benefit of SHOP Marketplace includes, allowing owner to offer health and dental coverage to employees. Other than that, with flexibility, choice, and the online application and account management, SHOP aims to meets the needs of the business owner and its employees. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.healthcare.gov/small-businesses/provide-shop-coverage/shop-marketplace-overview/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Employee Choice was introduced under of the PPACA's Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Marketplace.  While SHOP was available for 2014, this is the first year that small employers in 14 states can apply online. Before 2015 employers who provided health insurance to their employees typically worked with an  [[insurance broker]] and one [[health insurance company]]. In 2015, they however can offer their employees a choice of insurance companies.

SHOP enrollment is available  any time of the year - there is no "Open Enrollment" limitation.  Employers who wish to contribute to the premium cost of their employees may qualify to receive a [[SHOP tax credit]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biztimes.com/article/20141208/MAGAZINE03/312059981/-1/MAGAZINE&lt;/ref&gt; The tax credit is worth up to 50% of employer's contribution toward its employees' premium costs. It will be up to 35% for tax-exempt employers. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.healthcare.gov/small-businesses/provide-shop-coverage/small-business-tax-credits/&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, employees can't join the plan after the initial enrollment period unless they are new hires and qualify Special Enrollment Period.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.healthcare.gov/small-businesses/provide-shop-coverage/shop-marketplace-overview/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[HealthCare.gov]], special Enrollment Period refers to a time outside of the open enrollment period, in which you and your family have a right to sign up for health coverage. In other words, you qualify for a special enrollment period 60 days following certain life events, including but limited to: change in family status such as marriage or birth of a child, loss of other health coverage. 


However, SHOP Marketplace is not offered to self-employed individuals, with no employees. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.healthcare.gov/small-businesses/provide-shop-coverage/shop-marketplace-overview/&lt;/ref&gt; They can however get health coverage through [[Health Insurance Marketplace]] for individuals. 

As of March 13, 2015, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] claims, evidence has shown that the SHOP marketplace is working in terms of affordability. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/facts/factsheets/2014/10/affordable-care-act-is-working.html&lt;/ref&gt; For taxpayers, they are benefiting as the health costs and spending have decreased last year. &lt;ref&gt;content&lt;/ref&gt; With a historic slow down in the growth of [[health care prices in the United States|health care costs]], workers, business and taxpayers are able to generate savings under the introduction of SHOP. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/facts/factsheets/2014/10/affordable-care-act-is-working.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Star routes''' is a term used in connection with the [[United States Post Office Department|United States postal service]] and the contracting of mail delivery services. The term is defunct as of 1970, but still is occasionally used to refer to ''Highway Contract Routes'' or HCRs which replaced the Star routes.&lt;ref name=npm&gt;[[National Postal Museum]]. ''[http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/starroute/sr_02.html What is a Star Route?]''. Retrieved 2007-05-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Prior to 1845, transportation of inland [[mail]], other than by [[railroad]] or [[steamboat]], was given to bidders who offered stage or coach service.

This was abolished by act of Congress on March 3, 1845, which provided that the postmaster-general should lease all such contracts to the lowest bidder who tendered sufficient guarantee of faithful performance, without any conditions, except to provide for due celerity, certainty and security of transportation.  These bids became known as "celerity, certainty and security bids" and were designated on the route registers by three stars (***), thus becoming known as "star routes."&lt;ref name=npm/&gt;

==Star Route Frauds==
{{main|Star route scandal}}
The ''Star Route Frauds'' scandal involved a lucrative 19th century scheme whereby [[United States]] postal officials received bribes in exchange for awarding postal delivery contracts in southern and western areas.

An investigation into the Star Routes corruption took place under President [[James A. Garfield]] in 1881. Two previous congressional investigations into the Star Route frauds had occurred in 1872 and 1876 during the Grant Administration.  The 1872 investigation results had been tainted by bribery, while the 1876 investigation managed to shut down the Star Route frauds temporarily.  A resurgence of graft took place in 1878 in the Hayes Administration, continuing into the Garfield Administration.  Among the major players involved were some of the large contractors, the ex-US Representative [[Bradley Barlow]] of [[Vermont]], the Second Assistant Postmaster-General, some of the subordinates in the department, and [[Arkansas]] Senator [[Stephen W. Dorsey]], who became Secretary of the Republican National Committee during [[James A. Garfield]]'s 1880 presidential campaign. After Garfield's death by assassination, President [[Chester A. Arthur]] pursued the investigation.  A federal prosecution and trial took place in 1882, that was finally able to shut down the postal ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grossman|first=Mark|title=Political corruption in America: an encyclopedia of scandals, power, and greed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxupZ6O0p64C&amp;pg=PA308&amp;dq=A.J.+Creswell+Scandal&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=A.J.%20Creswell%20Scandal&amp;f=false|pages=308–309|year=2003|publisher=ABC-Clio|isbn=978-1-57607-060-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the fraudulent scheme was widespread, there were few convictions. Many of the defendants in the Star Routes trials were successfully defended by noted lawyer and orator, [[Robert G. Ingersoll|Robert Ingersoll]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingersoll, Robert. ''[http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/robert_ingersoll/star_route_trials/second_opening.html Opening remarks to the jury in the second Star Routes trial]'' December 21, 1882. Retrieved 2007-05-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Public disgust over the Star Routes graft served as an impetus for civil service reform and the passage of the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]] in 1883.

==Post-abolition==
Star Routes, now known as Highway Contract Routes (or HCRs) as of 1970, have become a mode of delivering mail directly to customers. Historically, Highway Contract Routes were used rarely for mail delivery to households. An exception was in rural areas with less than one customer per mile.

In modern usage, HCRs can be used any place to deliver mail directly to customers. They are often used to deliver mail in growth areas such as new housing tracts. Some of these routes are being started in areas where there are as few as twenty deliveries per day.

Since 2000, the US Postal Service has added the term "Contract Delivery Service" (CDS) as their newest version of the Star Route. These routes are specifically set up to serve newly created urban communities. CDS carriers do not transport mail, and are being used in an attempt to find delivery drivers who will work for less than USPS carrier wages. As of 2007, several thousand of these CDS routes have been created, with plans for far more.

Many contractors are no longer individuals wanting to transport mail between post offices, or to deliver mail in a remote community where they live. This new concentration of more urban contract routes has made it practical for businesses to bid on multiple contracts, and then seek out workers who will carry those routes for less money than the US Postal Service pays on each contract. The US Postal Service is still attempting to find an equilibrium between the dependability of career postal carriers and the cost savings of contractors acting as a temp agency.

There is some debate as to how much control the Postal Service can exercise over these contract routes and have them remain contractors. Exactly where the line is that will mark the difference between an HCR being a contractor and an employee is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;Akerman Senterfitt Attorneys. ''[http://www.akerman.com/public/pa_postal/LC_October2005.asp You Think You’re a Postal Contractor – But Maybe You’re an Employee!]'' October 2005. Retrieved 2009-11-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bank of Industry Limited''' (abbreviated as ''''BOI'''') is the oldest and largest [[Development finance institution|Development Finance Institution (DFI)]] currently operating in [[Nigeria]]. It is owned by the [[Federal Ministry of Finance (Nigeria)|Ministry of Finance Incorporated (MOFI) Nigeria]] (94.80%), the [[Central Bank of Nigeria|Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)]] (5.19%) and private shareholders (0.01%). The bank has 11 members on its board and it is chaired by Aliyu Abdulrahman Dikko. 

The bank is a parastatal under the [http://www.fmiti.gov.ng/nciticm/index.php Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment] tasked with providing financial assistance for the establishment of large, medium and small projects as well as the expansion, diversification and modernisation of existing enterprises; and rehabilitation of existing ones. In line with the [https://www.boi.ng/downloads/NIRP_1.pdf| Nigeria Industrial Revolution Plan] and [http://www.nationalplanning.gov.ng/images/docs/ERGP%20%20CLEAN%20COPY.pdf| Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP)] released by the Government of Nigeria, the bank focuses on financing industrial projects in key sectors of the economy such as: '''Agro and Food Processing''', '''Light Manufacturing''', '''Gas and Petrochemicals''', '''Engineering and Technology''', '''Solid Minerals''' and '''Creative Industries''' (arts and entertainment). BOI also focuses on promoting youth entrepreneurship, women-owned businesses and renewable energy projects.

== History ==

Bank of Industry Limited began operations in 1959 as the Investment Corporation of Nigeria (ICON) Limited. In 1964, ICON Limited was reconstituted to become the Nigerian Industrial Development Bank (NIDB) Limited under the guidance of the [[World Bank]]. Initially, [[International Finance Corporation|International Finance Corporation (IFC)]] held 75% equity in NIDB and produced the first Managing Director. However, the equity structure was diluted in 1976 as a result of the indigenization decree.&lt;ref&gt;worldbank.org: [http://lnweb90.worldbank.org/oed/oeddoclib.nsf/b57456d58aba40e585256ad400736404/0094ceaa9370516d852567f5005c7209?OpenDocument]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the BOI was reconstructed out of the merger of the Nigerian Industrial Development Bank (NIDB), Nigerian Bank for Commerce and Industry (NBCI) and the National Economic Reconstruction Fund (NERFUND). Although the bank's share capital was initially set at ₦50 billion in the wake of NIDB's reconstruction, it was increased to ₦250 billion in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;boi.ng: [http://www.boi.ng/about-us/]&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose was to better position BOI in addressing Nigeria's rising economic profile in line with its mandate to provide financial assistance for the establishments of new enterprises, the expansion, diversification and modernisation of existing enterprises, and the rehabilitation of ailing industries.

Over the years, the bank has undergone several transformations and re-engineered its processes to improve service delivery. In 2014, the bank commenced the use of Business Development Service Providers (BDSPs) in order to improve the quality of entrepreneurs and loan applications. The BDSPs are expected to assist MSMEs with structuring their business plans and business models and provide relevant capacity building and training programmes.&lt;ref&gt;boi.ng: [http://www.boi.ng/boi-signs-on-122-bdsps-look-to-improve-smes-access-to-funding/]&lt;/ref&gt; The bank is also collaborating with the [[Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency of Nigeria|Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN)]] and [[Department for International Development|Department for International Development (DFID)]] to create an institute to accredit BDSPs in Nigeria.

In 2015, the Bank of Industry, alongside [[The Tony Elumelu Foundation]], was awarded the Creative Entrepreneurs Association of Nigeria (CEAN) Creative Industry Award for the 'Highest Support for the Nigerian Creative Industry'.&lt;ref&gt;creative-nigeria.org: [http://www.creative-nigeria.org/tony-elumelu-bank-of-industry-ayo-makun-and-many-more-win-creative-industry-awards-2015/ ''Tony Elumelu, Bank of Industry, Ayo Makun and Many More Win Creative Industry Awards 2015'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The bank has played an active role in advocating for stable and reliable energy solutions in Nigeria. In 2011 the bank partnered with the [[United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)]]. This partnership then led to the development of the BOI-UNDP Solar Energy Programme (SEP), an intervention programme that promotes and supports the expansion of renewable energy services in off-grid rural communities. For its role in the deployment of electrification projects, the bank was presented with the 'Outstanding Sustainable Project Financing' award at the 2017 Karlsruhe Sustainable Finance Awards in [[Karlsruhe|Karlsruhe, Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;businessamlive.com: [http://www.businessamlive.com/nigerias-bank-industry-bags-karlsruhe-sustainable-devt-award/ ''Nigeria's Bank of Industry bags Karlsruhe sustainable devt award'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the bank was awarded the ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System (QMS) certification by [[DQS|DQS Holding GmbH]] after successfully completing the ISO 9001:2015 QMS certification programme.&lt;ref&gt;boi.ng: [http://www.boi.ng/iso-90012015-quality-management-system-award-certification/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==

The bank has been rated among the highest financial institutions in Nigeria with long term national ratings by [[Moody's Investors Service|Moody's]] (Aa3)&lt;ref name=Moodys2017/&gt;, [[Fitch Ratings|Fitch]] (AA+)&lt;ref name=Fitch2017/&gt; and Agusto &amp; Co. (Aa)&lt;ref name=Agusto2017/&gt;.

In driving economic growth, BOI has continuously focused on improving the access to finance available to SMEs. As such, the bank has several products to support MSME clusters. Some of these include:
* [[NollyFund]] - geared towards the development of the local film industry; 
* Fashion and Beauty Product - set up to support enterprises engaged in Adire (Tie &amp; Dye) and Aso-Oke, clothing design and production, fashion/beauty training institutes, leatherworks (shoes, bags, belts), beauty salons and more;
* Arts and Craft Product - introduced to support enterprises involved in pottery, brass works, wood designs, fibre crafts, painting etc.

BOI also serves as a key vehicle in managing and disbursing funds meant for intervention in certain sectors. 
In the past, the bank managed the ₦10 billion Rice Intervention Fund, ₦18 billion National Automotive Council (NAC) Fund, ₦9.6 billion Cement Fund, ₦4.3 billion Cassava Bread Fund and ₦18 billion Rice and Cassava Fund. 

The bank has been instrumental in administering the ₦300 billion Power and Aviation Intervention Fund and ₦50 billion Cotton, Textile and Garments Intervention Fund from the [[Central Bank of Nigeria|CBN]], $200 million Nigerian Content Intervention fund (NCI Fund), ₦2.5 billion Nigerian Artisanal and Small-Scale Miners (ASM) Finance Support Fund amongst other funds. BOI also manages and disburses the [http://marketmoni.com.ng| Government Enterprise and Empowerment Program (GEEP)], one of a number of social intervention programmes introduced by the Federal Government of Nigeria. GEEP (also known as MarketMoni) is a ₦140 billion fund aimed at supporting individuals in the [[informal economy|informal sector]] with loans at zero percent interest rate. Through the fund, BOI supports trade cooperatives, women cooperatives, micro-enterprises and trade associations with loans ranging from ₦10,000 to ₦50,000.&lt;ref&gt;marketmoni.com.ng: [http://marketmoni.com.ng/about-2/]&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of efforts to expand financing opportunities, BOI began partnerships with several state governments under a matching fund scheme. The MSME matching fund is a 50:50 counterpart funding scheme with State Governments to administer the fund for the establishment of micro, small or medium scale businesses in participating states.&lt;ref&gt;boi.ng: [https://www.boi.ng/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/State-Matching-Fund.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategic Partnerships ==

===Collaboration with Nigeria Content Development Management Board===
In August 2017, [http://ncdmb.gov.ng|The Nigeria Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB)] launched a $200 million Nigerian Content Intervention Fund (NCI Fund) to be used for developing capacity in the oil and gas industry. The fund was set up to finance projects, programmes and activities which directly increase Nigerian content in the oil and gas industry. The pool of funds will be managed by the BOI to meet the funding needs of indigenous manufacturers, service providers and other key players in the Nigerian Oil and gas Industry. The funds will be deployed towards providing support to indigenous players in the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry to procure fixed assets, refinance existing loans, fund working capital and finance contracts.&lt;ref&gt;ncdmb.gov.ng: [https://ncdmb.gov.ng/2017/08/ncdmb-boi-launch-200m-nci-fund/ ''NCDMB releases N61.18bn local content fund to BoI'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaboration with Federal Ministry of Mines and Steel Development===
In 2017, the [[Ministry of Mines and Steel Development|Federal Ministry of Mines and Steel Development (FMMSD)]] set up a ₦2.5 billion Nigerian Artisanal and Small-Scale Miners (ASM) Finance Support Fund and designated BOI as the sole fund manager. The purpose of the ASM Fund is to address the funding requirements of artisanal and small-scale miners while promoting the development of solid minerals potentials of Nigeria. Through the scheme, artisanal miners can access up to ₦10 million while small-scale miners can access up to ₦100 million.&lt;ref&gt;minesandsteel.gov.ng: [http://www.minesandsteel.gov.ng/2017/11/23/mmsdboi-calls-for-application-for-asm-support-fund/ ''MMSD, BoI Call for application for ASM Support Fund'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BOI-UNDP Solar Energy Programme ===
In 2011, BOI and [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) launched the Access to Renewable Energy Project. The project was set up to serve as an advocacy and awareness programme to promote and support the expansion of renewable energy services to support households and local enterprises in unserved and underserved communities. To achieve this, BOI and UNDP encouraged stakeholders in the renewable energy space to invest in the Nigerian sector. However, in 2015, the project was refocused to align with BOI's strategy to fund and implement renewable energy projects in collaboration with relevant stakeholders. As a result, the project was renamed to the Solar Energy Programme (SEP) to reflect the change in strategic direction. 

The SEP commenced with a Rural Electrification Project which involved the provision of long term financing for the installation of low cost micro-grid and stand-alone solar energy solutions in nominated off-grid rural communities. Between 2015 and 2016, micro-grid and stand-alone solar energy solutions were installed in 6 off-grid rural communities in 6 Nigerian States: [[Niger State]], [[Osun State]], [[Gombe State]], [[Anambra State]], [[Edo State]] and [[Kaduna State]].&lt;ref&gt;guardian.ng: [https://guardian.ng/business-services/boi-expands-renewable-energy-funding-with-n1b-solar-fund/ ''BoI expands renewable energy funding with N1b solar fund'']&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-paid metres, using Pay-As-You-Go models, were installed in each household and microenterprise to accommodate for flexibility of payment and to solve challenges of unpaid bills. The pilot phase was considered a success and also attracted several potential investors across Nigeria.

On the back of this success, BOI and UNDP entered into a cost-sharing agreement to fund the second phase of the project. In 2016, BOI provided $1.4 million debt financing while UNDP provided $600,000 grant to replicate the solar energy solutions in 11 additional off-grid communities across 4 Nigerian States: [[Niger State]], [[Gombe State]], [[Anambra State]] and [[Kaduna State]].

In view of the benefits of the SEP, BOI introduced a ₦2 billion Solar Energy commercial product in 2017 to be accessed by various categories of end users both directly through BOI and indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;thecable.ng: [https://www.thecable.ng/boi-unveils-n1bn-solar-energy-fund-light-nigeria/ ''BOI unveils N1bn solar energy fund to 'light up Nigeria''']&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the Solar Energy Programme, the bank aims to power more than 100,000 off-grid households and microenterprises in rural and commercial communities by 2021.&lt;ref&gt;thisdaylive.com: [https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2016/10/03/boi-undp-sign-2m-agreement-on-solar-energy-for-off-grid-communities/ ''BoI, UNDP Sign $2m Agreement on Solar Energy for Off-grid Communities'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collaboration with African Development Bank (AfDB) Group ===
In 2011, the Board of Directors of African Development Bank (AfDB) Group approved $500 million multi-tranche line of credit to assist BOI in financing local SMEs Nigeria. In 2015 and 2017, the bank received $100 million (in two tranches of $50 million each) to fund export-oriented SMEs with the capacity to generate foreign exchange.&lt;ref&gt;sunnewsonline.com: [http://sunnewsonline.com/special-report-on-bank-of-industry-boi-boi-driving-the-engine-of-nigerias-industrial-growth/ ''Special Report on Bank of Industry (BoI): BOI: Driving the Engine of Nigeria's Industrial Growth'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;boi.ng: [http://www.boi.ng/boi-secures-afdbs-100mfacility-for-smes/ ''BOI Secures AfDB $100 million Facility to Support SMEs'']&lt;/ref&gt; The line of credit would be provided for funding projects aimed at systematic poverty reduction, employment generation and wealth creation through entrepreneurial, social and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;afdb.org: [https://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/afdb-approves-a-financial-package-of-usd-500-million-for-the-bank-of-industry-nigeria-8045/ ''AfDB Approves a Financial Package of USD 500 Million for the Bank of Industry (Nigeria)'']&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the agreement, AfDB required the bank provide technical assistance for capacity building for both BOI and SMEs. To this end, BOI enlisted international companies BDO/GBRW.&lt;ref&gt;boi.ng: [http://www.boi.ng/boi-secures-afdbs-100mfacility-for-smes/]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2017, the interest rate was revised to 0% to ensure sustainability of youth businesses and to encourage more youth entrepreneurs under the NYSC scheme.&lt;ref&gt;boi.ng: [http://www.boi.ng/bank-of-industry-boi-graduate-entrepreneurship-fund-gef-for-nysc-members/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The GEF scheme is available to serving NYSC members that have successfully passed the Bank's screening process, attended the capacity building programme developed specifically for the prospects under GEF and submitted a bankable business plan. Applicants are able to access loans up to ₦2 million.&lt;ref&gt;guardian.ng: [https://guardian.ng/business-services/boi-reduces-interest-rate-to-zero-percent-for-youths/ '' BoI reduces interest rate to zero percent for youths'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme was developed in 2016 to provide funding to aspiring entrepreneurs aged 18 - 35 years with a minimum educational qualification of Ordinary National Diploma. Individuals may access up to ₦5 million out of the ₦10 billion fund. Similar to the Graduate Entrepreneur Fund (GEF), the programme also offers capacity building in entrepreneurship, business management and technical skills.

Ltd, ValueCon Business Services, VSL Consult Ltd, Empretec Nigeria Foundation, Fate Foundation and AfterSchool Graduate Development Centre (AGDC) to facilitate the Entrepreneurship Capacity Building programme.&lt;ref&gt;boi.ng: [http://www.boi.ng/yes/]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Youth Ignite Programme ===
The Youth Ignite Programme was introduced in 2017, in partnership with Afterschool Graduate Development Centre (AGDC), to cater to youth-led businesses at the micro level. The programme is designed to provide capacity building and funding up to ₦200,000 to micro enterprises.

'''''The Strangest Secret''''' was a 1957 spoken word record by [[Earl Nightingale]] which sold over one million copies and received the first Gold Record for the spoken word,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/music/Earl+Nightingale|title=Earl Nightingale — Free listening, videos, concerts, stats and photos at Last.fm|website=Last.fm}}&lt;/ref&gt; which helped launch the fields of business motivation and audio publishing. It was later adapted into print and video forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awaken.com/2013/01/earl-nightingale/|title=Earl Nightingale - Awaken|website=www.awaken.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Earl-Nightingale-The-Strangest-Secret/release/10831837|title=Earl Nightingale - The Strangest Secret|website=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
In 1950 [[Earl Nightingale]] was inspired by the words "we become what we think about" in [[Napoleon Hill]]'s book [[Think and Grow Rich]] around the same time he bought an insurance agency. He provided weekly motivational speeches to the agency's sales staff. In 1956, he recorded a motivational speech to be played while he was on vacation. Nightingale's employees spread word of the speech, and demand for the recording grew so large that he and friend Lloyd Conant formed the Nightingale-Conant Corporation to manage sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.success.com/article/earl-nightingales-greatest-discovery|title=Earl Nightingale's Greatest Discovery|date=30 March 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nightingale.com/authors/earl-nightingale.html|title=Earl Nightingale|website=www.nightingale.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/3402848/mod_resource/content/1/16Earl_Nightingale_The+Strangest+Secret-Nightingale.pdf|title=Moodle USP: e-Disciplinas|first=Codely|last=Tecnologia|website=edisciplinas.usp.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlnightingale.com/EarlNightingale___Audio.html|title=About Earl Nightingale|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The audio recording was later adapted into print form as a short 44 page essay. The teachings focus on nonconformity and self-education, and summarizes that "You are now, and you do become, what you think about."&lt;ref name="Horowitz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ideas.time.com/2013/10/24/the-10-best-self-help-books-youve-probably-never-heard-of/|title=The 10 Best Self-Help Books You've (Probably) Never Heard Of|first=Mitch|last=Horowitz|publisher=|via=ideas.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/how-to/growth-strategies/2014/12/earl-nightingale-and-the-strangest-secret.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/616911-earl-nightingale-s-the-strangest-secret|title=The Strangest Secret Quotes by Earl Nightingale|website=www.goodreads.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vicente Solano Lima''' (September 21, 1901 &amp;ndash; April 23, 1984) was a moderately conservative newspaper publisher and politician who served as [[Vice President]] of [[Argentina]] from May 25, 1973 to July 13, 1973.

==Life and times==
Born in [[Ramallo, Buenos Aires]], Solano Lima joined the Popular Conservative Party while enrolled in the [[University of La Plata]]. He earned a law degree in 1921 and became a provincial legislator in 1925, serving in the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Lower House of the Argentine Congress]] on two occasions as a center-right [[w:es:Partido Demócrata Nacional|National Democratic Party]] member. Solano Lima purchased an ailing [[San Nicolás de los Arroyos]] newspaper, ''[[w:es:Diario El Norte (San Nicolás)|El Norte]]'', in 1928. Becoming a market leader in northeastern Buenos Aires Province (an area which also includes Ramallo), ''El Norte'' became a forum for the National Democrats, who enjoyed majorities in Congress during most of the 1930s. 
[[Image:Sede diario el norte.jpg|thumb|left|Solano Lima's influential ''El Norte'', [[San Nicolás de los Arroyos]].]]

The election of laborioust leader [[Juan Perón]] to the Presidency in 1946 resulted in the daily's closure in 1948. Following Perón's 1955 overthrow, however, the National Democrats' staunchly anti-[[Peronist]] stance led Solano Lima to join Senator Alberto Fonrouge in his break from the party, co-founding the Popular Conservative Party in 1958. Supporting a policy of rapproachment with the exiled Perón, the Popular Conservatives joined the banned Peronists in a joint Popular Front for the [[Argentine general election, 1963|1963 elections]], for which he accepted the nomination for the Presidency; the [[Argentine military|military]]'s insistence on their ban thwarted the move, however, and helped lead to record [[blank vote]]s.  

The ban on Peronism was rescinded ahead by President [[Alejandro Lanusse]] ahead of his call for new [[Argentine general election, March 1973|elections in 1973]], and the Popular Conservatives endorsed Perón's stand-in, [[Héctor Cámpora]]. Despite his [[conservatism|conservative]] affiliation, Solano Lima was nominated as the leftist Cámpora's running-mate, and the ticket sailed to victory on March 11. Taking office on May 25, Solano Lima focused his attention on helping increase university enrollment among the working and lower classes in Argentina. He joined President Cámpora in [[Juan Perón]]'s retinue on the leader's June 20 return from exile in [[Madrid]]; facing sudden [[Ezeiza Massacre|rioting]] near the international airport on their descent, further tragedy was averted by the Vice President's insistence that the flight be diverted to the [[Morón Airport and Air Base]]. The confrontation and differences between Cámpora and Perón's leading right-wing advisor, [[José López Rega]], caused Solano Lima to resign as Vice-President on July 13, leading Cámpora to do likewise. 

Suffering from worsening [[asthma]], Solano Lima considered retirement in [[Spain]], but was persuaded by Perón to stay on as Chief of Staff when the latter was elected President on [[Argentine general election, September 1973|snap elections]] in September. Perón appointed him [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the [[University of Buenos Aires]] in March 1974, though the president's death that July led to Solano Lima's retirement from public life, days later. Returning to San Nicolás, he joined a number of friends in a law practice, and granted numerous interviews in subsequent years; he died in Buenos Aires in 1984, at age 82.
