{{Distinguish|AP English Language and Composition}}
{{Advanced Placement}}
'''Advanced Placement English Literature and Composition''' (or '''AP English Literature and Composition''', '''AP Lit and Comp''', '''Senior AP English''', '''AP Lit''', or '''AP English IV''') is a course and examination offered by the [[College Board]] as part of the [[Advanced Placement Program]]. When AP exams were first implemented, English Language and English Literature were initially combined. They separated in 1980.

==The course==
Designated for motivated students with a command of standard [[English language|English]], an interest in exploring and analyzing challenging classical and contemporary [[literature]], and a desire to analyze and interpret dominant [[literary]] [[genre]]s and [[Theme (literature)|theme]]s, it is often offered to high school seniors and the other AP English course, AP English Language and Composition, to juniors. The College Board does not restrict courses by grade. Students learn and apply methods of literary analysis and write with a variety of purposes to increase precision in expression. Students in AP English Literature and Composition typically sit for the national AP examination administered each May for the College Board by the Educational Testing Service. The College Board publishes changing information about all AP courses and examinations on its web site.

On one of the three essays students write as part of the examination, students choose a work of literature they will write about. Readers of the exam who get an essay on a work they have not read typically pass the essay to a reader who has. The scoring guides that readers use to rate the essays are developed by experienced readers on site just before the reading begins each June, using some of the actual exam essays. Since those scoring guides do not exist before the Reading, instructors cannot teach to them but focus instead on encouraging text-based analysis.

== Commonly read literary works ==
The College Board publishes a recommended reading list, while emphasizing that it "does not mandate any particular authors or reading list." The reading list contains four major categories:

*[[Poetry]], ranging from the 16th century ([[William Shakespeare]]) to contemporary poets ([[Seamus Heaney]]);
*[[Drama]], ranging from [[Greek tragedy|Greek tragedies]] ([[Aeschylus]]) to post-modern [[absurdism|absurdist]]s ([[Tom Stoppard]]);
*[[Fiction]] &amp;ndash; [[novel]]s and [[short story|short stories]], from the 18th century comedies of manner of [[Jane Austen]] to the famous "[[Lost Generation]]" of [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]];
*Expository prose ([[essay]]s), including [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[George Orwell]].

==Grade distributions==
In the 2012 administration, 380,608 students took the exam, with a mean score of 2.80.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/ap12_engl_lit_ScoringDist.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
Independent research on the academic benefits of the Advanced Placement English Literature and Composition course indicates that not all students receive academic benefits from participating in the course. In a study with a sample size of over 90,000, the authors found that students who took the AP English Literature and Composition course did not receive any increase in academic achievement unless they also prepared for and took the AP test. The authors controlled for over 70 intervening variables and found that AP students who took and passed the English Composition and Literature exam had ACT scores that were 2.8 points higher than non-AP students or AP English students who did not take their course's AP test.&lt;ref name="Warne et al. (2015)"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Larsen|first2=Ross|last3=Anderson|first3=Braydon|last4=Odasso|first4=Alyce J.|date=2015|title=The impact of participation in the Advanced Placement program on students' college admissions test scores|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00220671.2014.917253|journal=The Journal of Educational Research|volume=108|issue=5|pages=400–416|doi=10.1080/00220671.2014.917253|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led the authors to state that AP participation "... is not beneficial to students who merely enroll in the courses ..."&lt;ref name="Warne et al.

'''Agnostic atheism''' is a philosophical position that encompasses both [[atheism]] and [[agnosticism]]. Agnostic atheists are atheistic because they do not hold a [[belief]] in the existence of any deity and agnostic because they claim that the existence of a [[deity]] is either unknowable in principle or currently unknown in fact.

The agnostic atheist may be contrasted with the [[agnostic theist]], who believes that one or more deities exist but claims that the existence or nonexistence of such is unknown or cannot be known.&lt;ref&gt;

Agnosticism addresses knowledge; atheism addresses belief.

== History ==
[[File:Irreligion map.png|thumb|250px|Fraction of atheists and agnostics in different countries]]

One of the earliest definitions of agnostic atheism is that of theologian and philosopher [[Robert Flint]], in his Croall Lecture of 1887–1888 (published in 1903 under the title ''Agnosticism'').

&lt;blockquote&gt;The atheist may however be, and not unfrequently is, an agnostic. There is an agnostic atheism or atheistic agnosticism, and the combination of atheism with agnosticism which may be so named is not an uncommon one.&lt;ref name=flint&gt;{{cite book|last=Flint|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Flint|title=Agnosticism: The Croall Lecture for 1887–88|year=1903|publisher=William Blackwood and Sons|ol=7193167M|pages=49–51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DWMtAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If a man has failed to find any good reason for believing that there is a God, it is perfectly natural and rational that he should not believe that there is a God; and if so, he is an atheist... if he goes farther, and, after an investigation into the nature and reach of human knowledge, ending in the conclusion that the existence of God is incapable of proof, cease to believe in it on the ground that he cannot know it to be true, he is an agnostic and also an atheist – an agnostic-atheist – an atheist because an agnostic... while, then, it is erroneous to identify agnosticism and atheism, it is equally erroneous so to separate them as if the one were exclusive of the other...&lt;ref name=flint/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1885 [[Robert G. Ingersoll]], popularly known as "The Great Agnostic", explained his comparative view of agnosticism and atheism as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jacoby |first=Susan |date=2013 |title=The Great Agnostic |location= |publisher=Yale University Press |page =17 | isbn=978-0-300-13725-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Agnostic is an Atheist. The Atheist is an Agnostic. The Agnostic says, ‘I do not know, but I do not believe there is any God.’ The Atheist says the same.}}

==Epistemological arguments ==
{{Further|Theological noncognitivism}}
[[Epistemology|Epistemological]], or agnostic, atheism argues that people cannot know a God or determine the existence of a God. The foundation of epistemological atheism is agnosticism, which takes a variety of forms. In the philosophy of [[immanence]], divinity is inseparable from the world itself, including a person's mind, and each person's [[consciousness]] is locked in the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]. According to this form of agnosticism, this limitation in perspective prevents any objective inference from belief in a god to assertions of its existence.

The [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] agnosticism of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] only accepts knowledge deduced with human rationality; this form of atheism holds that gods are not discernible as a matter of principle, and therefore cannot be known to exist. [[Skepticism]], based on the ideas of [[David Hume|Hume]], asserts that certainty about anything is impossible, so one can never know for sure whether or not a god exists. Hume, however, held that such unobservable metaphysical concepts should be rejected as "sophistry and illusion". The allocation of agnosticism to atheism is disputed; it can also be regarded as an independent, basic worldview.

Other arguments for atheism that can be classified as epistemological or [[ontology|ontological]], including [[logical positivism]] and [[ignosticism]], assert the meaninglessness or unintelligibility of basic terms such as "God" and statements such as "God is all-powerful." [[Theological noncognitivism]] holds that the statement "God exists" does not express a proposition, but is nonsensical or cognitively meaningless. It has been argued both ways as to whether such individuals can be classified into some form of atheism or agnosticism. Philosophers [[Alfred Ayer|A. J. Ayer]] and [[Theodore M. Drange]] reject both categories, stating that both camps accept "God exists" as a proposition; they instead place noncognitivism in its own category.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Drange|Drange, Theodore M.]] (1998). "[http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/definition.html Atheism, Agnosticism, Noncognitivism]". [[Internet Infidels]], ''Secular Web Library''. Retrieved 2007-APR-07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Ayer|Ayer, A. J.]] (1946). ''Language, Truth and Logic''. Dover. pp. 115–116. In a footnote, Ayer attributes this view to "Professor [[H. H. Price]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcohol is a depressant. After consumption, alcohol causes the body’s systems to slow down. Often, feelings of [[drunkenness]] are associated with elation and happiness but other feelings of anger or depression can arise. Balance, judgment, and coordination are also negatively affected. One of the most significant short term side effects of alcohol is reduced inhibition. Reduced inhibitions can lead to an increase in sexual behavior.&lt;ref name="LC2" /&gt;

As testosterone is critical for libido and physical arousal, alcohol tends to have deleterious effects on male sexual performance. Studies have been conducted that indicate increasing levels of alcohol intoxication produce a significant degradation in male masturbatory effectiveness (MME). This degradation was measured by measuring blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and ejaculation latency.&lt;ref name="G4"&gt;

== In women ==
In women, the effects of alcohol on libido in the literature are mixed. Some women report that alcohol increases sexual arousal and desire, however, some studies show alcohol lower the physiological signs of arousal.&lt;ref name="B32"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Ackerman|first2=KT|year=1995|title=Women, alcohol, and sexuality|journal=[[Recent Developments in Alcoholism]]|volume=12|pages=267–85|pmid=7624547|last1=Beckman|first1=LJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study found that alcohol negatively affected how positive the sexual experience was in both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=M.

Also, because women have a higher percentage of body fat and less water in their bodies, alcohol can have a quicker, more severe impact. Women's bodies take longer to process alcohol; more precisely, a woman's body often takes one-third longer to eliminate the substance.&lt;ref name="LC22"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=George|first2=WH|year=1989|title=Alcohol and human sexuality: Review and integration|journal=[[Psychological Bulletin]]|volume=105|issue=3|pages=374–86|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.105.3.374|pmid=2660179|last1=Crowe|first1=LC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual behavior in women under the influence of alcohol is also different from men. Studies have shown that increased BAC is associated with longer orgasmic latencies and decreased intensity of orgasm.&lt;ref name="B32" /&gt; Some women report a greater [[sexual arousal]] with increased alcohol consumption as well as increased sensations of pleasure during orgasm. Because ejaculatory response is visual and can more easily be measured in males, orgasmic response must be measured more intimately. In studies of the female orgasm under the influence of alcohol, orgasmic latencies were measured using a [[vaginal photoplethysmograph]], which essentially measures vaginal blood volume.&lt;ref name="B32" /&gt;

Psychologically, alcohol has also played a role in sexual behavior. It has been reported that women who were intoxicated believed they were more sexually aroused than before consumption of alcohol.&lt;ref name="B32" /&gt; This psychological effect contrasts with the physiological effects measured, but refers back to the loss of inhibitions because of alcohol. Often, alcohol can influence the capacity for a woman to feel more relaxed and in turn, be more sexual. Alcohol may be considered by some women to be a sexual disinhibitor.&lt;ref name="B32" /&gt;

==Drug facilitated sexual assault==
{{main article|Drug facilitated sexual assault}}

Drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA), also known as predator rape, is a sexual assault carried out after the victim has become incapacitated due to having consumed [[alcohol]] or other [[drug]]s. The unofficial term "date rape drug" came into widespread usage in the early 1990s through U.S. news media reports. Researchers say that unlike other types of rape, DFSA is not a crime of physical violence: it is a crime of sexual [[hedonism]] and entitlement.&lt;ref name="Welner 2008"&gt;{{cite book | first1=Michael | last1=Welner | first2=Barbara | last2=Welner | chapter=Chapter 23: Drug-Facilitated Sex Assault | pages=445–462 | editor1-first=Robert R. | editor1-last=Hazelwood | editor2-first=Ann Wolbert | editor2-last=Burgess | title=Practical Aspects of Rape Investigation: A Multidisciplinary Approach | edition=4th | publisher=CRC Press | year=2008 | isbn=978-1-4200-6504-6 | doi=10.1201/9781420065053.ch23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A date rape drug, also called a predator drug, is any drug that can be used to assist in the execution of [[drug facilitated sexual assault]] (DFSA). The most common types of DFSA are those in which a victim ingested drugs willingly for recreational purposes, or had them administered surreptitiously:&lt;ref name="Lyman 2006 70"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyman|first=Michael D.|title=Practical drug enforcement|year=2006|publisher=CRC|location=Boca Raton, Fla.|isbn=978-0849398087|pages=70|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the latter type of [[assault]] that the term "date rape drug" most often refers to.

==Sexual risk-taking==
Alcohol intoxication is associated with an increased risk that people will become involved in risky sexual behaviours, such as [[unprotected sex]].&lt;ref name="G4"/&gt; It is unclear whether the two are linked or the [[personality type]]s of people who often drink large amounts of alcohol are more tolerant of risk-taking.

Alcohol is linked to a large proportion of unwanted outcomes associated with sex such as [[date rape]], [[unwanted pregnancy]] and [[sexually transmitted diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;

=="Beer goggles"{{anchor|Beer_goggles}}== &lt;!-- [[Beer goggles]], [[Cider visor]], and [[Stella vision]] all redirect to this section --&gt;
"Beer goggles" is a slang term for the phenomenon in which consumption of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] lowers [[sexual inhibition]]s to the point that very little or no discretion is used when approaching or choosing sexual partners. The term is often humorously applied when an individual is observed making, and later regretting, advances towards a partner who would be deemed unattractive or inappropriate when sober. The "beer goggles" are considered to have distorted the "wearer's" vision, making unattractive people appear beautiful, or at least passably attractive.

A study published in 2003 supported the beer goggles hypothesis; however, it also found that another explanation is that regular drinkers tend to have personality traits that mean they find people more attractive, whether or not they are under the influence of alcohol at the time.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2836">The '''Arditi–Ginzburg equations''' describe [[ratio]] dependent [[Predation|predator–prey]] dynamics. Where ''N'' is the population of a prey species and ''P'' that of a predator, the population dynamics are described by the following two equations:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Coupling in predator-prey dynamics: Ratio-Dependence|url = http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0022519389802115/1-s2.0-S0022519389802115-main.pdf?_tid=1565d0da-6588-11e5-a81d-00000aab0f6b&amp;acdnat=1443407265_75f5fff588be891df9d652f2e3d694ff|website = ac.els-cdn.com|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{dN}{dt} &amp; = f(N)\,N-g{\left(\!\tfrac N P \!\right)}P \\[4pt]
\frac{dP}{dt} &amp; = e \,g{\left(\!\tfrac N P\! \right)}P-uP
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''f''(''N'') captures any change in the prey population not due to predator activity including inherent [[Birth rate|birth]] and [[Mortality rate|death rates]]. The per capita effect of predators on the prey population (the harvest rate) is modeled by a function ''g'' which is a function of the [[ratio]] ''N''/''P'' of prey to predators. Predators receive a reproductive payoff, ''e,'' for consuming prey, and die at rate ''u''. Making predation pressure a function of the ratio of prey to predators contrasts with the prey dependent [[Lotka–Volterra equations]], where the effect of predators on the prey population is simply a function of the magnitude of the prey population ''g''(''N''). Because the number of prey harvested by each predator decreases as predators become more [[Population density|dense]], ratio dependent predation represents an example of a [[trophic function]]. Ratio dependent predation may account for [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneity]]  in large-scale natural systems in which predator efficiency decreases when prey is scarce.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The merit of ratio dependent versus prey dependent models of predation has been the subject of much controversy, especially between the biologists [[Lev R. Ginzburg]] and Peter A. Abrams.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|title = The nature of predation: prey dependent, ratio dependent or neither?|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016953470001908X||accessdate = 2015-09-28|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(00)01908-X|volume=15|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|pages=337–341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ginzburg purports that ratio dependent models more accurately depict predator-prey interactions while Abrams maintains that these models make unwarranted complicating assumptions.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9760">'''Automatic identification and data capture''' (AIDC) refers to the methods of automatically identifying objects, collecting [[Data (computing)|data]] about them, and entering them directly into [[computer]] systems, without human involvement. Technologies typically considered as part of AIDC include [[bar codes]], [[RFID|Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)]], [[biometrics]] (like [[iris recognition|iris]] and [[facial recognition system]]), [[magnetic stripe]]s, [[Optical character recognition]] (OCR), [[smart cards]], and [[Speech recognition|voice recognition]]. AIDC is also commonly referred to as “Automatic Identification”, “Auto-ID” and "Automatic Data Capture".

AIDC is the process or means of obtaining external data, particularly through analysis of [[image]]s, [[sound]]s or [[video]]s. To capture data, a [[transducer]] is employed which converts the actual image or a sound into a digital file. The file is then stored and at a later time it can be analyzed by a computer, or compared with other files in a database to verify identity or to provide authorization to enter a secured system. Capturing of data can be done in various ways; the best method depends on application.

In biometric security systems, capture is the acquisition of or the process of acquiring and identifying characteristics such as finger image, palm image, facial image, iris print or voice print which involves audio data and the rest all involves video data.

Radio-frequency identification is relatively a new AIDC technology which was first developed in 1980s. The technology acts as a base in automated data collection, identification and analysis systems worldwide. RFID has found its importance in a wide range of markets, including [[Animal identification|livestock identification]] and Automated Vehicle Identification (AVI) systems because of its capability to track moving objects. These automated wireless AIDC systems are effective in manufacturing environments where barcode labels could not survive.

==Overview of automatic identification methods ==
Nearly all of the automatic identification technologies consist of three principal components, which also comprise the sequential steps in AIDC-
1 Data encoder . A code is a set of symbols or signals that usually represent alphanumeric characters. When data are encoded, the characters are translated into a machine readable code. A label or tag containing the encoded data is attached to the item that is to be identified.
2 Machine reader or scanner. This device reads the encoded data, converting them to alternative form, usually an electrical analog signal.
3 Data decoder. This component transforms the electrical signal into digital data and finally  back into the original alphanumeric characters.

==Capturing data from printed documents==
One of the most useful application tasks of data capture is collecting information from paper documents and saving it into databases (CMS, ECM and other systems). There are several types of basic technologies used for data capture according to the data type:{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

*DLR - for document layer recognition{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

These basic technologies allow extracting information from paper documents for further processing it in the enterprise information systems such as [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]], [[Customer relationship management|CRM]] and others.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The documents for data capture can be divided into 3 groups: '''structured''', '''semi-structured''' '''and unstructured'''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

'''Structured documents''' (questionnaires, tests, insurance forms, tax returns, ballots, etc.) have completely the same structure and appearance. It is the easiest type for data capture, because every data field is located at the same place for all documents.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

'''Semi-structured documents''' (invoices, purchase orders, waybills, etc.) have the same structure but their appearance depends on number of items and other parameters. Capturing data from these documents is a complex, but solvable task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yi|first=Jeonghee|date=Fall 2000|title=A classifier for semi-structured documents|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=13B1E16BC52B74FE4373CD864444B81A?doi=10.1.1.87.2662&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=340 - 344|doi=10.1145/350000/347164/p340-yi.pdf|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Unstructured documents''' (letters, contracts, articles, etc.) could be flexible with structure and appearance.

==The Internet and the future==

The idea is as simple as its application is difficult. If all cans, books, shoes or parts of cars are equipped with minuscule identifying devices, daily life on our planet will undergo a transformation. Things like running out of stock or wasted products will no longer exist as we will know exactly what is being consumed on the other side of the globe. Theft will be a thing of the past as we will know where a product is at all times. Counterfeiting of critical or costly items such as drugs, repair parts, or electronic components will be reduced or eliminated because manufacturers or other supply chain entities will know where their products are at all times. Product wastage or spoilage will be reduced because environmental sensors will alert suppliers or consumers when sensitive products are exposed to excessive heat, cold, vibration, or other risks. Supply chains will operate far more efficiently because suppliers will ship only the products needed when and where they are needed. Consumer and supplier prices should also drop accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Waldner |first = Jean-Baptiste |authorlink = Jean-Baptiste Waldner |title = Nanocomputers and Swarm Intelligence |publisher = [[ISTE Ltd|ISTE]] [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |place = London |year = 2008 | pages = 205–214 |isbn = 1-84704-002-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global association [[Auto-ID Center]] was founded in 1999 and is made up of 100 of the largest companies in the world such as [[Wal-Mart]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]], [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]], [[Pfizer]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[Unilever]], [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], companies working in the sector of technology such as SAP, Aliens, Sun as well as five academic research centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/automation/documents/centerguide.pdf |title= The New Network |author= Auto-ID Center |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are based at the following Universities; MIT in the USA, Cambridge University in the UK, the University of Adelaide in Australia, Keio University in Japan and University of St. Gallen in Switzerland.

The Auto-ID Center suggests a concept of a future supply chain that is based on the Internet of objects, i.e. a global application of RFID. They try to harmonize technology, processes and organization. Research is focused on miniaturization (aiming for a size of 0.3&amp;nbsp;mm/chip), reduction in the price per single device (aiming at around $0.05 per unit), the development of innovative application such as payment without any physical contact (Sony/Philips), domotics (clothes equipped with radio tags and intelligent washing machines), and sporting events (timing at the Berlin marathon).

==AIDC 100==
[[AIDC 100]] is a professional organization for the automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) industry. This group is composed of individuals who made substantial contributions to the advancement of the industry. Increasing business's understanding of AIDC processes and technologies are the primary goals of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AIDC 100|url=http://www.aidc100.org|work=AIDC 100: Professionals Who Excel in Serving the AIDC Industry|accessdate=2 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724230937/http://www.aidc100.org/| archivedate= 24 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bandim Health Project''' works with population based health research in one of the world's poorest countries, [[Guinea-Bissau]] in West Africa.

The core of the project is a health and [[Demography|demographic surveillance]] system which registers more than 100,000 people in six suburbs of the capital [[Bissau]]. Furthermore, 182 representative clusters of 100 women and their children are followed in the rural areas. Information on health, diseases, immunisations, breast-feeding, etc. is collected, primarily focusing on women and children. Admissions to the country's sole [[Pediatrics|pediatric ward]] in the capital are recorded.

The Bandim Health Project is member of the INDEPTH Network of health and demographic surveillance sites in Africa, Asia and Oceania.

{{coord|11|50|43.64|N|15|35|45.42|W|type:landmark|display=title}}

==History==
The Bandim Health Project was initiated in 1978 by Peter Aaby. The project is currently based on collaboration between the [[Ministry of Health]] in Guinea-Bissau, [[Statens Serum Institut]] in Denmark, and researchers affiliated to The [[University of Southern Denmark]], as well as the [[University of Aarhus]], Denmark.

In 2012, the Danish National Research Foundation funded the establishment of the Center of Excellence, The Research Center for Vitamins and Vaccines (CVIVA) based on the Bandim Health Project and its research into [[non-specific effect of vaccines|non-specific effects of vaccines]].

==Fields of research==
The Bandim Health Project works with population based health research, focusing on women and children. The project's fields of research include:
* '''[[Vaccine]]s''', both their specific effects on the targeted diseases, and in particular their potential [[non-specific effect of vaccines|non-specific effects]] on [[incidence (epidemiology)|morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]].
* '''Other [[health intervention]]s''', including assessment of the total impact on mortality of new interventions or changes in existing policies.
* '''[[Infectious disease]]s''', e.g. [[measles]], [[diarrhoea]], [[rotavirus]], [[respiratory infection]]s, [[malaria]], HIV, [[HTLV]], and [[Tuberculosis]].
* '''Nutrition''', including [[micronutrient]]s such as [[vitamin A]] supplementation, and [[breast-feeding]].
* '''[[Humanitarian aid]].

==Important results==
One of the most important findings was that a new [[measles vaccine]] used in [[Developing country|low-income countries]] was associated with a two-fold increase in mortality among girls. This discovery led to the withdrawal of the vaccine.&lt;ref name=WHO92&gt;{{cite journal|last1=WHO|title=Expanded programme on immunization (EPI). Safety of high titre measles vaccines.|journal=Wkly Epidemiol Rec|volume=67|pages=1992|pmid=1449986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Had it not been withdrawn, it could have cost at least ½ million additional female deaths per year in Africa alone.&lt;ref&gt;Aaby, P., et al. "Differences in female-male mortality after high-titre measles vaccine and association with subsequent vaccination with diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis and inactivated poliovirus: reanalysis of West African studies."

==The organization==
The Bandim Health Project is led by Peter Aaby. The National Research Coordinator is Amabelia Rodrigues. Since the project's foundation in 1978, more than 700 [[scientific article]]s have been published, and more than 40 PhD or [[doctoral degree]]s and 13 [[Master's degree|Masters]] of International Health degrees have been obtained by researchers employed by the project.

===Affiliations===
Bandim Health Project is placed in Guinea-Bissau and also has a small department at [[Statens Serum Institut]] in Denmark. Bandim Health Project is also affiliated with [[University of Southern Denmark]], where Peter Aaby is an [[adjunct professor]] and Christine Benn holds a professorship in Global Health.

A '''bill of attainder''' (also known as an '''act of attainder''' or '''writ of attainder''' or '''bill of pains and penalties''') is an act of a [[legislature]] declaring a person or group of persons guilty of some crime and punishing them, often without a trial. As with [[attainder]] resulting from the normal judicial process, the effect of such a bill is to nullify the targeted person's [[civil rights]], most notably the right to own property (and thus pass it on to heirs), the right to a title of nobility, and, in at least the original usage, the right to life itself. Bills of attainder passed in Parliament by Henry Vlll on 29 January 1542 resulted in the executions of a number of notable historical figures.

The use of these bills by Parliament eventually fell into disfavour due to the obvious potential for abuse and the violation of several legal principles, most importantly the right to [[due process]], the precept that a law should address a particular form of behaviour rather than a specific individual or group, and the [[separation of powers]].

==Jurisdictions==

===Australia===
Unlike the United States Constitution, there is no specific provision prohibiting the Commonwealth Government from passing bills of attainder. However, the [[High Court of Australia]] has ruled that bills of attainder are unconstitutional, because it is a violation of the separation of powers doctrine for any body other than a Chapter III court to wield judicial power.&lt;ref name="Wheat case"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|17|1915|link=New South Wales v Commonwealth (1915)|litigants=New South Wales v Commonwealth |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1915/17.pdf (1915) 20 CLR 54] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Communist case"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|5|1951|litigants=[[Australian Communist Party v Commonwealth]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1951/5.pdf (1951) 83 CLR 1] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boilermakers"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|10|1956|litigants=[[R v Kirby; Ex parte Boilermakers' Society of Australia]] |parallelcite=(1956) 94 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 254 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the core aspects of judicial power is the ability to make binding and authoritative decisions on questions of law, that is, issues relating to life, liberty or property.&lt;ref name="Huddart"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|36|1909|litigants=[[Huddart, Parker &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Moorehead]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1909/36.pdf (1909)&amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp;CLR&amp;nbsp;330] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Polyukhovich"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|32|1991|litigants=[[Polyukhovich v Commonwealth]] (War Crimes Act case) |parallelcite=(1991) 172 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 501 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The wielding of judicial power by the legislative or executive branch includes the direct wielding of power and the indirect wielding of judicial power.&lt;ref name="Lim"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|64|1992|litigants=[[Chu Kheng Lim v Minister of Immigration]] |parallelcite=(1992) 176 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The state constitutions in Australia contain few limitations on government power. Bills of attainder are considered permissible because there is no entrenched separation of powers at the state level.&lt;ref&gt;''Building Construction Employees and Builders' Labourers Federation of New South Wales v Minister of Industrial Relations'' (1986) 7 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 372, [[Supreme Court of New South Wales|Court of Appeal]] (NSW, Australia).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VicRp|46|1994|litigants=City of Collingwood v Victoria [No2] |parallelcite=[1994] 1 [[Victorian Reports|VR]] 652 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[section 77 of the Constitution of Australia]] permits state courts to be invested with Commonwealth jurisdiction, and any state law that renders a state court unable to function as Chapter III court (Commonwealth jurisdiction) is unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|24|1996|litigants=[[Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW)]] |parallelcite=(1996) 189 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 51 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The States cannot structure their legal systems to prevent them from being subject to the Australian Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|1|2010|litigants=[[Kirk v Industrial Court of NSW]] |parallelcite=(2010) 239 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 531 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important distinction is that laws seeking to direct judicial power (e.g. must make orders)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|49|2009|litigants=International Finance Trust Company Ltd v New South Wales Crime Commission (Criminal Assets Recovery case) |parallelcite=(2009) 240 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 319 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; are unconstitutional, but laws that concern mandatory sentencing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NTSC|120|1997|litigants=Wynbyne v Marshall |parallelcite=(1997) 99 {{abbr|A Crim R|Australian Criminal Reports}} 1 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v Moffatt'' [1998] 2 [[Victorian Reports|VR]] 229, [[Supreme Court of Victoria|Court of Appeal]] (Vic, Australia).&lt;/ref&gt; rules of evidence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|9|1998|litigants=Nicholas v The Queen |parallelcite=(1998) 193 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 173 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; non-punitive imprisonment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|46|1998|litigants=Fardon v Attorney-General (QLD) |parallelcite=(2004) 223 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 575 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or tests,&lt;ref&gt;

===Canada===
In two cases of attempts to pass bills (in 1984 for [[Clifford Olson]] and in 1995 for [[Karla Homolka]]) to inflict a judicial penalty on a specific person, the speakers of the [[House of Commons of Canada|House]] and [[Senate of Canada|Senate]], respectively, have ruled that Canadian parliamentary practice does not permit bills of attainder or bills of pains and penalties.&lt;ref&gt;Canada: 32nd Parliament, 2nd Session, 14 May 1984 {{cite web|title=Debates of the House of Commons: "An Act respecting the execution of Clifford Robert Olson|url=http://parl.canadiana.ca/view/oop.debates_HOC3202_03/1321?r=0&amp;s=1|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=23 November 2015|page=3683}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Canada: 35th Parliament, 1st Session, 28 November 1995 {{cite web|title=Debates of the Senate: "Bill Concerning Karla Homolka|url=http://parl.canadiana.ca/view/oop.debates_SOC3501_02/366?r=0&amp;s=1|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=23 November 2014|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

====Usage under English law====
The word "[[attainder]]", meaning "taintedness", is part of English [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;The word "attainder" does not, in fact, derive from a Latin expression meaning "tainted", but from a French expression meaning "to attain", in the sense of condemn. http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/12725?redirectedFrom=attainder#eid&lt;/ref&gt; Under English law, a criminal condemned for a serious crime, whether [[treason]] or [[felony]] (but not [[misdemeanor|misdemeanour]], which referred to less serious crimes), could be declared "attainted", meaning that his civil rights were nullified: he could no longer own property or pass property to his family by will or testament. His property could consequently revert to the Crown or to the [[mesne lord]]. Any [[peerage]] titles would also revert to the Crown. The convicted person would normally be punished by [[execution (legal)|judicial execution]]—when a person committed a capital crime and was put to death for it, the property left behind [[escheat]]ed to the Crown or lord rather than being inherited by family. Attainder functioned more or less as the revocation of the feudal chain of privilege and all rights and properties thus granted.

Due to [[mandatory sentencing]], the due process of the courts provided limited flexibility to deal with the various circumstances of offenders. The property of criminals caught alive and put to death because of a guilty plea or jury conviction on a not guilty plea could be forfeited, as could the property of those who escaped justice and were outlawed; but the property of offenders who died before trial, except those killed during the commission of crimes (who fell foul of the law relating to ''[[felo de se]]''), could not be forfeited, nor could the property of offenders who refused to plead and who were tortured to death through ''[[peine forte et dure]]''.

On the other hand, when a legal conviction did take place, confiscation and "corruption of blood" sometimes appeared unduly harsh for the surviving family. In some cases (at least regarding the peerage) the Crown would eventually re-grant the convicted peer's lands and titles to his heir. It was also possible, as political fortunes turned, for a bill of attainder to be reversed. This sometimes occurred long after the convicted person was executed.

Unlike the mandatory sentences of the courts, acts of Parliament provided considerable latitude in suiting the punishment to the particular conditions of the offender's family. Parliament could also impose non-capital punishments without involving courts; such bills are called '''bills of pains and penalties'''.

Bills of attainder were sometimes criticised as a convenient way for the [[British monarchy|King]] to convict subjects of crimes and confiscate their property without the bother of a trial – and without the need for a conviction or indeed any evidence at all.

The first use of attainder was in 1321 against both [[Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester]] and his son [[Hugh Despenser the Younger|Hugh Despenser the Younger, Earl of Gloucester]]. They were both attainted for supporting [[Edward II of England|King Edward II]] during his struggle with the [[Isabella of France|queen]] and barons.

In England, those executed subject to attainders include [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence]] (1478); [[Thomas Cromwell]] (1540); [[Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury]] (1540); [[Catherine Howard]] (1542); Baron [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]] (1549); [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Duke Thomas Howard of Norfolk]] (1572); [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Earl Thomas Wentworth of Strafford]] (1641); Archbishop [[William Laud]] of [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]] (1645); and the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke James Scott of Monmouth]]. In the case of Catherine Howard, in 1541 King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was the first monarch to delegate [[Royal Assent]], to avoid having to assent personally to the execution of his wife.

After defeating [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] and replacing him on the throne of England, [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] had Parliament pass a bill of attainder against his predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/richard-iii-the-truth-may-yet-be-discovered-8142320.html|title=Richard III: The truth may yet be discovered|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is noteworthy that this bill made no mention of the [[Princes in the Tower]], although it does declare him guilty of "shedding of Infants blood."&lt;ref name="Kendall, Richard IIIA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kendall|first1=Paul Murray|ref=Kendall|title=[[Richard III (biography)|Richard the Third]]|authorlink=Paul Murray Kendall|publisher=[[W. W. Norton]]|year= 1956|isbn=0-393-00785-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although deceased by the time of the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], the [[List of regicides of Charles I|regicides]] [[John Bradshaw (judge)|John Bradshaw]], [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Henry Ireton]] and [[Thomas Pride]] were served with a bill of attainder on 15 May 1660 backdated to 1 January 1649 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|NS]]). After the committee stages, the bill passed both the Houses of Lords and Commons and was engrossed on 4 December 1660. This was followed with a resolution that passed both Houses on the same day:&lt;ref name="british-history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=26189 |title=House of Commons Journal Volume 8: 15 May 1660 &amp;#124; British History Online |publisher=british-history.ac.uk|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="british-history2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=26317 |title=House of Commons Journal Volume 8: 4 December 1660 &amp;#124; British History Online |publisher=british-history.ac.uk|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="british-history3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=26867 |title=Index: A-J &amp;#124; British History Online &amp;#124; ''Journal of the House of Commons:'' volume 8 |publisher=british-history.ac.uk|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1685, when the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth| Duke of Monmouth]] landed in West England and started [[Monmouth Rebellion|a rebellion]] in an effort to overthrow his uncle, the recently enthroned [[James II of England|James II]], Parliament passed an bill of attainder against him. After the [[Battle of Sedgemoor]], this made it possible for King James to have the captured Monmouth put summarily to death. Though  legal, this was regarded by many as an arbitrary and ruthless act.

In 1753, the Jacobite leader [[Archibald Cameron of Locheil]] was summarily put to death on the basis of a seven-year-old bill of attainder, rather than being put on trial for his recent subversive activities in Scotland. This aroused some protests in British public opinion at the time, including from people with no Jacobite sympathies.

The last use of attainder was in 1798 against [[Lord Edward FitzGerald]] for leading the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]].

====The Great Act of Attainder====
In 1688, King [[James II of England]] (VII of Scotland), driven off by the ascent of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] in the [[Glorious Revolution]], came to Ireland with the sole purpose of reclaiming his throne. After his arrival, the [[Parliament of Ireland]] assembled a list of names in 1689 of those reported to have been disloyal to him, eventually tallying between two and three thousand, in a bill of attainder. Those on the list were to report to Dublin for sentencing. One man, [[William Stewart, 1st Viscount Mountjoy|Lord Mountjoy]], was in the [[Bastille]] at the time and was told by the Irish Parliament that he must break out of his cell and make it back to Ireland for his punishment, or face the grisly process of being [[Drawing and quartering|drawn and quartered]].&lt;ref&gt;Macaulay, ''History of England from the Accession of James the Second'' (London, 1855), 216–220&lt;/ref&gt; The parliament became known in the 1800s as the "[[Patriot Parliament]]".

Later defenders of the Patriot Parliament pointed out that the ensuing "[[Treaty of Limerick#The Williamite Settlement forfeitures|Williamite Settlement forfeitures]]" of the 1690s named an even larger number of [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] suspects, most of whom had been attainted by 1699.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/E800002-045/index.html TO Davis, "The Irish Parliament of James II"], 1843&lt;/ref&gt;

====Private bills====
{{main article|Private bill}}
{{About|legislation that affects a specific person|legislation proposed by a single MP|Private member's bill|section=yes}}

In the Westminster system (and especially in the United Kingdom), a similar concept is covered by the term "private bill" (a bill which upon passage becomes a private Act). Note however that "private bill" is a general term referring to a proposal for legislation applying to a specific person; it is only a bill of attainder if it punishes them; private bills have been used in some Commonwealth countries to effect divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Millar and Sheldon Goldenberg (1998). "Explaining Child Custody Determinations in Canada", ''Canadian Journal of Law and Society'', Vol. 13, No. 1, p. 209-225.&lt;/ref&gt; Other traditional uses of private bills include chartering corporations, changing the charters of existing corporations, granting monopolies, approving of public infrastructure and seizure of property for those, as well as enclosure of commons and similar redistributions of property. Those types of private bills operate to take away private property and rights from certain individuals, but are usually not called "bill of pains and penalties".

The last United Kingdom bill called a "Pains and Penalties Bill" was [[Pains and Penalties Bill 1820]] and was passed by the House of Lords in 1820, but not considered by the House of Commons; it sought to divorce [[Caroline of Brunswick|Queen Caroline]] from King George IV and adjust her titles and property accordingly, on grounds of her alleged adultery, as did many private bills dealing with divorces of private persons.

It has been reported that no bills of attainder have been passed since 1820 in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Zechariah Chafee, Jr., ''Three Human Rights in the Constitution of 1787 at 97'' (Univ. of Kans. Press, 1956)&lt;/ref&gt; Attainder as such was also a legal consequence of convictions in courts of law, but this ceased to be a part of punishment in 1870.&lt;ref name="british-civil-wars"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/glossary/impeachment-attainder.htm |title=BCW Project :: British Civil Wars, Commonwealth &amp;amp; Protectorate 1638-1660 &amp;#124; Impeachment &amp; Attainder |author=David Plant|publisher=british-civil-wars.co.uk|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====World War II====
Previously secret British [[War Cabinet#Second World War|War Cabinet]] papers released on 1 January 2006 have shown that, as early as December 1942, the War Cabinet had discussed their policy for the punishment of the leading Nazis if captured. [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] had then advocated a policy of [[summary execution]] with the use of an Act of Attainder to circumvent legal obstacles. He was dissuaded by cabinet minister [[Richard Law, 1st Baron Coleraine|Richard Law]] who pointed out that the United States and Soviet Union still favoured trials.&lt;ref&gt;John Crossland [http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article210371.ece "Churchill: execute Hitler without trial"], ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', 1 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/trials/nurnbergtrial.html Holocaust Education and Archive Research Team], "The 1st Nuremberg Trial"&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
==== Colonial era ====
Bills of attainder were used through the 18th century in England, and were applied to British colonies as well. Some colonists were inspired to the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]] because of anger at the injustice of attainder. Although at least one American state used a bill of attainder to confiscate the property of a British [[United Empire Loyalist|loyalist]] (called [[Tory|Tories]]) during the war (New York, in the 1779 case of [[Parker Wickham]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parker Wickham (1727–1785)|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~jwickham/parker.htm|website=Ancestry.com|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; American dissatisfaction with British attainder laws resulted in their being prohibited in the U.S. Constitution ratified in 1789.

==== Constitutional bans ====
[[File:Constitution Pg2of4 AC-attainder.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Excerpt from Article One, Section 9 of the United States Constitution, prohibiting the passing of bills of attainder]]

The [[United States Constitution]] forbids legislative bills of attainder: in federal law under [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|Article I, Section 9]], and in state law under [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 10: Limits on the States|Article I, Section 10]]. The fact that they were banned even under state law reflects the importance that the framers attached to this issue.

Within the U.S. Constitution, the clauses forbidding attainder laws serve two purposes. First, they reinforced the [[separation of powers]], by forbidding the legislature to perform [[judiciary|judicial]] or executive functions—since the outcome of any such acts of legislature would of necessity take the form of a bill of attainder. Second, they embody the concept of [[due process]], which was partially reinforced by the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] to the Constitution. The text of the Constitution, Article I, Section 9, Clause 3 is "No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed".

The constitution of every state also expressly forbids bills of attainder.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} For example, [[Wisconsin Constitution|Wisconsin's constitution]] Article I, Section 12 reads:

{{quote|No bill of attainder, [[ex post facto law]], nor any law impairing the obligation of contracts, shall ever be passed, and no conviction shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture of estate.}}

Contrast this with the Texas version: Article 1 (Titled Bill of Rights) Section 16, entitled ''Bills of Attainder; Ex Post Facto or Retroactive Laws: Impairing Obligation of Contracts'': "No bill of attainder, ex post facto law, retroactive law, or any law impairing the obligation of contracts, shall be made". It is unclear whether a contract that calls for heirs to be deprived of their estate is allowed under this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jacob |last=Reynolds |title=The Rule of Law and the Origins of the Bill of Attainder Clause |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/stlr18&amp;div=13&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals |journal=St. Thomas Law Review |year=2005 |volume=18 |issue=1 |page=177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cases before the U.S. Supreme Court ====
The U.S. Supreme Court has invalidated laws under the Attainder Clause on only five occasions.&lt;ref&gt;"Nonattainder as a Liberty Interest", ''Wisconsin Law Review'', 2010, p. 1229.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]'s first decisions on the meaning of the bill of attainder clause came after the [[American Civil War]]. In ''[[Ex parte Garland]]'', 71 U.S. 333 (1866), the court struck down a federal law requiring attorneys practising in federal court to swear that they had not supported the rebellion. In ''[[Cummings v. Missouri]]'', 71 U.S. 277 (1867), the [[Missouri]] constitution required anyone seeking a professional's license from the state to swear they had not supported the rebellion. The Supreme Court overturned the law and the constitutional provision, arguing that the people already admitted to practice were subject to penalty without judicial trial.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Hart Ely|Ely, John H.]] ''On Constitutional Ground''. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1996, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of judicial trial was the critical affront to the Constitution, the Court said.&lt;ref&gt;Nabers, Deak. ''Victory of Law: The Fourteenth Amendment, the Civil War, and American Literature, 1852–1867''. Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two decades later, however, the Court upheld similar laws. In ''[[Hawker v. New York]]'', 170 U.S. 189 (1898), a state law barred convicted felons from practising medicine. In ''[[Dent v. West Virginia]]'', 129 U.S. 114 (1889), a state law imposed a new requirement that practising physicians had to have graduated from a licensed medical school or they would be forced to surrender their license. The Court upheld both laws because, it said, the laws were narrowly tailored to focus on an individual's qualifications to practice medicine.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, Theodore. ''The Second Amendment Controversy—Explained.'' 2d ed. Indianapolis: iUniverse, 2002, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; That was not true in ''Garland'' or ''Cummings''.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyond481483"&gt;"Beyond Process: A Substantive Rationale for the Bill of Attainder Clause". ''Virginia Law Review''. 70:475 (April 1984), p. 481-483.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court changed its "bill of attainder test" in 1946. In ''[[United States v. Lovett]]'', 328 U.S. 303 (1946), the Court confronted a federal law that named three people as subversive and excluded them from federal employment. Previously, the Court had held that lack of judicial trial and the narrow way in which the law rationally achieved its goals were the only tests of a bill of attainder. But the ''Lovett'' Court said that a bill of attainder 1) specifically identified the people to be punished; 2) imposed punishment; and 3) did so without benefit of judicial trial.&lt;ref&gt;Cushman, Robert Fairchild and Koniak, Susan P. ''Cases in Civil Liberties''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1994, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Heritage Guide to the Constitution''. Washington, D.C.: Heritage Foundation, 2005, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; As all three prongs of the bill of attainder test were met in ''Lovett'', the court held that a congressional statute that bars particular individuals from government employment qualifies as punishment prohibited by the bill of attainder clause.

The [[Taft–Hartley Act]] (enacted in 1947) sought to ban [[strike action|political strikes]] by [[Communism|Communist]]-dominated [[trade union|labour unions]] by requiring all elected labour leaders to take an oath that they were not and had never been members of the [[Communist Party USA]], and that they did not advocate violent overthrow of the U.S. government. It also made it a crime for members of the Communist Party to serve on executive boards of labour unions. In ''[[American Communications Association v. Douds]]'', 339 U.S. 382 (1950), the Supreme Court had said that the requirement for the oath was not a bill of attainder because: 1) anyone could avoid punishment by disavowing the Communist Party, and 2) it focused on a future act (overthrow of the government) and not a past one.&lt;ref name="Welsh"&gt;Welsh, Jane. "The Bill of Attainder Clause: An Unqualified Guarantee of Process". ''Brooklyn Law Review''. 50:77 (Fall 1983), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting current fears, the Court commented in ''Douds'' on approving the specific focus on Communists by noting what a threat communism was.&lt;ref&gt;Wiecek, William M. ''History of the Supreme Court of the United States: The Birth of the Modern Constitution: The United States Supreme Court, 1941–1953''. New York: Macmillan, 2006, p. 548.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court had added an "escape clause" test to determining whether a law was a bill of attainder.&lt;ref name="Welsh" /&gt;

In ''[[United States v. Brown]]'', 381 U.S. 437 (1965), the Court invalidated the section of the statute that criminalized a former communist serving on a union's executive board. Clearly, the Act had focused on past behaviour and had specified a specific class of people to be punished. But if this specific focus in ''Brown'' was constitutionally invalid, why was it ''not'' constitutionally invalid in ''Douds''?&lt;ref&gt;"Beyond Process: A Substantive Rationale for the Bill of Attainder Clause", ''Virginia Law Review'', April 1984, p. 485.&lt;/ref&gt; (Many legal scholars assumed that the ''Brown'' case effectively, if not officially, overruled ''Douds''.)&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitz, Victor. ''Unrepentant Leftist: A Lawyer's Memoir''. Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press, 1996, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Court did not apply the punishment prong of its test, leaving legal scholars confused as to whether the Court still intended it to apply.&lt;ref&gt;Welsh, "The Bill of Attainder Clause: An Unqualified Guarantee of Process", ''Brooklyn Law Review'', Fall 1983, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court emphasised the narrowness and rationality of bills of attainder in ''[[Nixon v. Administrator of General Services]]'', 433 U.S. 425 (1977). During the [[Watergate scandal]], in 1974 Congress passed the [[Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act]], which required the [[General Services Administration]] to confiscate former President [[Richard Nixon]]'s presidential papers to prevent their destruction, screen out those which contained national security and other issues which might prevent their publication, and release the remainder of the papers to the public as fast as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Ripley, Anthony. "U.S. Judge Rules Nixon Documents Belong to Nation", ''New York Times'', 1 February 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court upheld the law in ''Nixon'', arguing that specificity alone did not invalidate the act because the President constituted a "class of one".&lt;ref name="Stark"&gt;Stark, Jack. ''Prohibited Government Acts: A Reference Guide to the United States Constitution''. Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 2002, p. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, specificity was constitutional if it was rationally related to the class identified.&lt;ref name="Stark" /&gt; The Court modified its punishment test, concluding that only those laws which historically offended the bill of attainder clause were invalid.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, ''Prohibited Government Acts: A Reference Guide to the United States Constitution'', 2002, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also found it significant that Nixon was compensated for the loss of his papers, which alleviated the punishment.&lt;ref name="Stark75"&gt;Stark, ''Prohibited Government Acts: A Reference Guide to the United States Constitution'', 2002, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court modified the punishment prong by holding that punishment could survive scrutiny if it was rationally related to other, nonpunitive goals.&lt;ref name="Stark75" /&gt; Finally, the Court concluded that the legislation must not be intended to punish; legislation enacted for otherwise legitimate purposes could be saved so long as punishment was a side-effect rather than the main purpose of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, ''Prohibited Government Acts: A Reference Guide to the United States Constitution'', 2002, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cases considered by lower courts ====
A number of cases which raised the bill of attainder issue did not reach or have not reached the Supreme Court, but were considered by lower courts.

In 1990, in the wake of the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]], Congress enacted the [[Oil Pollution Act of 1990|Oil Pollution Act]] to consolidate various oil spill and oil pollution statutes into a single unified law, and to provide for a statutory regime for handling oil spill cleanup. This law was challenged as a bill of attainder by the shipping division of [[ExxonMobil]].&lt;ref&gt;''SeaRiver Maritime Fin. Holdings, Inc. v. Pena'', 952 F.Supp. 9, D.D.C. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carringan, Alison C. "The Bill of Attainder Clause: A New Weapon to Challenge the Oil Pollution Act of 1990", ''Boston College Environmental Affairs Law Review'' 28:119 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] struck down the [[Elizabeth Morgan Act]] as a bill of attainder.&lt;ref&gt;''Doris R. Foretich, et al. v. United States'', 351 F.3d 1198 (D.C.App. 2003); Leonning, Carol D. "Appeals Court Rules Against Morgan Law", ''Washington Post'' 17 December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution in late 2009 barring the community organising group [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now]] (ACORN) from receiving federal funding, the group sued the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;Fahim, Kareem. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/13/nyregion/13acorn.html "Acorn Sues Over Funding Vote in House"]. ''New York Times'', 12 November 2009. Accessed 14 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Another, broader bill, the Defund ACORN Act, was enacted by Congress later that year. In March 2010, a federal district court declared the funding ban an unconstitutional bill of attainder.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, Michael B. "Funding Gone, Scandal-Plagued ACORN to Disband". ''Christian Science Monitor'', 23 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 August 2010, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] reversed and remanded on the grounds that only 10 percent of ACORN's funding was federal and that did not constitute "punishment".&lt;ref&gt;"Federal Court Rules Against Acorn". Associated Press: 14 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ACORN v.

United States|accessdate = 23 July 2015|date = 20 January 2011|publisher = Harvard Law Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Possible cases ====
There is argument over whether the [[Palm Sunday Compromise]] in the [[Terri Schiavo case]] was a bill of attainder.&lt;ref&gt;Calabresi, Steven G. "The Terri Schiavo Case: In Defense of the Special Law Enacted by Congress and President Bush", ''Northwestern University Law Review'' 100:1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGough, Michael. "Terri's Law: Is It Constitutional?" ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', 22 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marks, Jr., Thomas C. "Terri Schiavo and the Law", ''Albany Law Review'' 67:843 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analysts considered a proposed Congressional bill to confiscate 90 percent of the bonus money paid to executives at federally rescued investment bank [[American International Group]] a bill of attainder, although disagreement exists on the issue. The bill was not passed by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Ashby. "Would an AIG-Bonus Tax Pass Constitutional Muster? (A Tribe Calls 'Yes!')" ''Wall Street Journal'', 18 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Connor. "No Bill of Attainder... Shall Be Passed". ''The Atlantic'', 16 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the City of Portland's attempt to prosecute more severely those on a "secret list" of 350 individuals deemed by police to have committed "liveability crimes" in certain neighbourhoods was challenged as unconstitutional bill of attainder.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/secret-list-on-trial/Content?oid=1055123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.streetroots.org/2009/03/11/two-more-cases-add-list-trial&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the House voted to defund [[Planned Parenthood]]. Democratic Representative [[Jerrold Nadler|Jerry Nadler]] called that vote a bill of attainder, saying it was unconstitutional as such because the legislation was targeting a specific group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = House votes to defund Planned Parenthood - David Nather and Kate Nocera|url = http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0211/49830.html|accessdate = 23 July 2015|first = David Nather and Kate|last = Nocera|date = 18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the House reinstated the [[Holman Rule]], a procedural rule that enables lawmakers to reduce the pay of an individual federal worker down to $1.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenation.com/article/the-holman-rule-once-allowed-congress-to-purge-leftists-from-government-agencies-now-its-back/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles Eamer Kempe, 1860.jpg|thumb|upright|Kempe in 1860]]

'''Charles Eamer Kempe''' (29 June 1837 – 29 April 1907) was a Victorian designer and manufacturer of [[stained glass]]. His studios produced over 4,000 windows and also designs for altars and altar frontals, furniture and furnishings, lichgates and memorials that helped to define a later nineteenth-century Anglican style. The list of English cathedrals containing examples of his work includes: [[Chester Cathedral|Chester]], [[Gloucester Cathedral|Gloucester]], [[Hereford Cathedral|Hereford]], [[Lichfield Cathedral|Lichfield]], [[Wells Cathedral|Wells]], [[Winchester Cathedral|Winchester]] and [[York Minster|York]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;
Kempe in Sussex, Adrian Barlow, South Down Living, June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
[[File:York Minster - RWB Hornby Window.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert William Bilton Hornby|R.W.B. Hornby]] memorial window at York Minster]]
Charles Kempe was born at Ovingdean Hall, near [[Brighton]], [[East Sussex]] in 1837. He was the youngest son of Nathaniel Kemp, a cousin of [[Thomas Read Kemp]], a politician and property developer responsible for the [[Kemptown, Brighton|Kemptown]] area of Brighton&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Kempe added the ‘e’ to his name in adult life&lt;/ref&gt; and the maternal grandson of Sir [[John Eamer]], who served as [[Lord Mayor of London]] in 1801.

After attending [[Twyford School]], he attended [[Pembroke College, Oxford]] where he was influenced by the [[Oxford Movement|Anglo-Catholic Tractarian]] revival and considered a vocation to the priesthood. When it became clear that his severe [[stammer]] would be an impediment to preaching Kempe decided that "if I was not permitted to minister in the Sanctuary I would use my talents to adorn it", and subsequently went to study [[architecture]] with the firm of a leading ecclesiastical architect [[George Frederick Bodley]], where he learned the aesthetic principles of medieval church art, particularly stained glass. During the 1860s Kempe collaborated with Bodley on the internal painting of two churches, [[All Saints Church, Cambridge|All Saints, Jesus Lane]] in [[Cambridge]] and [[Church of Saint John the Baptist, Liverpool|St John’s]], [[Tuebrook]] in [[Liverpool]]. Later, in 1892, Bodley and Kempe would work together once more on All Saints at [[Danehill, East Sussex|Danehill]], [[East Sussex]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Kempe Studios ==
[[File:Kempe maker's mark.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Kempe company maker's mark, the Wheatsheaf, on a window in [[St Mary's Church, Nottingham]]]]
In 1866 he opened a studio of his own in [[London]], supplying and creating stained glass and furnishings and [[vestment]]s. The firm prospered and by 1899 he had over fifty employees. As a [[trademark]], the firm used a golden ''garb'' or wheatsheaf, taken from Kempe's own [[coat of arms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LlQOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA471&amp;lpg=PA471&amp;dq=%22garb%20or%22|title=The baronetage of England, or, The history of the English baronets, and such baronets of Scotland, as are of English families|first=rev William|last=Betham|date=1 January 1801|publisher=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mid-Victorian period were important years in the history of the design of English churches and Kempe’s influence is found in numerous examples, many in his home county of Sussex which has 116 examples of his work.&lt;ref&gt;The Corpus of Kempe Stained Glass, editor Philip N.H. Collins, The Kempe Trust, 2000,&lt;/ref&gt; The works at St Mark’s, [[Staplefield]] near [[Horsham]], [[West Sussex]] dating from 1869 are regarded as especially important, representing the earliest of three known examples of Kempe’s wall painting.&lt;ref&gt;http://southdownsliving.blogspot.com/2010/04/kempe-wall-paintings-st-marks-church.html Information on Kempe wall paintings at St Mark’s,  Staplefield&lt;/ref&gt; They contain key elements of Kempe’s figurative work. The angels holding the scroll are magnificently apparelled and the borders of their cloaks are embellished with pearls, each individually highlighted although they do not contain a design of peacock feathers, a well used embellishment in later works. [[Rosalie Glynn Grylls]], [[Mander family|Lady Mander]], whose home [[Wightwick Manor]], near [[Wolverhampton]], contains many pieces of Kempe's stained glass, wrote in 1973:
"Kempe's work has a unique charm; its colours shine out from jewels that cluster on the [[mitre]]s or the [[Crown (headgear)|crowns]] his figures wear and from their [[peacock]]s' feathers, while [[angel]]s playing their instruments are drawn with tender delicacy and scattered above the main windows informally but making a pattern of precision. Above all, the prevailing yellow wash is literally translucent, for it lets through the rays of the full or the setting sun..." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.owlpen.com/wightwick.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322231351/http://www.owlpen.com/wightwick.shtml |archivedate=22 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }} Information on Wightwick Manor&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:St Peter's Church, Binton - The Scott Window.jpg|thumb|upright|The Scott Memorial Window in [[St Peter's Church, Binton]]]]
On Kempe’s death in 1907 in accordance with his will the firm was reformed as C. E Kempe &amp; Co. Ltd and Kempe's distant cousin, Walter Earnest Tower (1873–1955), was appointed Chairman. Tower thenceforth used a black tower above the golden garb. A lack of orders caused by the [[Great Depression]] ended the firm's life in 1934.

==Personal life==
Kempe was a rather shy person, who never married. He continued to live in Sussex most of his life and in 1875 he bought and renovated an Elizabethan House at [[Lindfield, West Sussex|Lindfield]], near [[Haywards Heath]] in West Sussex. Kempe would entertain his clients and professional colleagues from his home enjoying the role of a country squire.

Kempe died suddenly on 28 April 1907 aged 69, at 28 Nottingham Place, London, having caught a cold that led to congestion of the lung and refused to get medical help. He 
is buried in the churchyard at [[St Wulfran's Church, Ovingdean]].&lt;ref name="Dale207"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |page=207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, most of Kempe's records were disposed of after the firm shut in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7890">'''David Louis Mearns''', O.A.M., M.Sc., (born 10 August 1958), is an [[United States|American]]-born [[United Kingdom]] based marine scientist and [[Oceanography|Oceanographer]], who specializes in deep water search and recovery operations, and the discovery of the location of historic ship wrecks.

==Early life==
Mearns was raised in [[Weehawken, New Jersey]], where he attended [[Weehawken High School]], graduating in 1976. He subsequently graduated [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] in Marine Biology from [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]] in 1980, and obtained a [[Master of Science|Masters]] degree in Marine Geology from the [[University of South Florida]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Hague|Hague, Jim]]. [http://www.hudsonreporter.com/view/full_story/2376595/article-Weehawken-native-finds-HMS-Hood-on-ocean-s-floor-Mearns--six-year-journey-ends-with-mixed-emotions--leads-to-documentary--book?instance-search_results "Weehawken native finds HMS Hood on ocean's floor Mearns' six-year journey ends with mixed emotions; leads to documentary, book"], ''[[The Hudson Reporter]]'', November 9, 2001. Accessed December 29, 2016. "When David Mearns was a youngster growing up in Weehawken, he was always fascinated by water.... Upon graduating from Weehawken High School in 1976, Mearns headed to Fairleigh Dickinson University to major in marine biology. He graduated in 1980 after studying in St. Croix in the Virgin Islands for a semester, then headed to graduate school at the University of South Florida in Tampa."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oceanographic career==
From 1986 to 1995 Mearns was employed in the commercial undersea surveying industry in a managerial capacity. In 1990 he worked on the criminal investigation into the foundering of the [[cargo ship|freighter]] ''[[Lucona]]'', and in 1994 located the wreck of the [[ore-bulk-oil carrier]] {{MV|Derbyshire}}. Relocating to [[England]] in the mid 1990s, he established ''Blue Water Recoveries, Limited'', a commercial company that locates and researches historic deep-sea shipwrecks across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;Entry (dated 2017) for Mearns on the Linkedin professional profile website.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]] high seas confrontation between the naval forces of the [[British Empire]] and [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]], Mearns successfully led an expedition funded by [[Channel 4 Television]] to locate and film on the seabed of the [[North Atlantic Ocean]] the wrecks of the Royal Navy flagship [[HMS Hood|H.M.S ''Hood'']], and its nemesis, [[German battleship Bismarck]]. An extended television documentary entitled ''The Hunt for the Hood'' was produced from the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;IMDb entry for 'The Hunt for the Hood'. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1318884/&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
Blue Water Recoveries Ltd. holds three [[Guinness World Records]], including one for the deepest shipwreck ever found, the German [[blockade runner]] ''Rio Grande'', which was located at a depth of {{Convert|5762|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;A.B.C. (Australia) Report, 'The Hunt for H.M.A.S. Sydney', April 2008. http://www.abc.net.au/tv/hmassydney/whosinvd.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Mearns [[Search for HMAS Sydney and German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran|led a search team to find]] the [[Australia]]n cruiser {{HMAS|Sydney|D48|6}} and the German auxiliary cruiser [[German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran|''Kormoran'']], which both sank following a [[Battle between HMAS Sydney and German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran|engagement]] off of [[Western Australia]] in 1941 during World War 2. Prior to finding H.M.A.S. ''Sydney'', Mearns said that it was, in some ways, "bigger than the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]''" because of what it meant to Australia. "Nothing comes close to the ''Sydney''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,20741311-2,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120905153042/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,20741311-2,00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-05 |title='I'll find HMAS Sydney' |date=2006-11-12 |accessdate=2008-09-01 |publisher=Sunday Telegraph |work=news.com.au }}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the end of 2010, he successfully led the search for another missing Australian shipwreck, the Hospital Ship [[AHS Centaur|''Centaur'']], which was torpedoed off [[Queensland]] by a [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]] submarine in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/discovery-proves-maligned-navigator-gordon-rippon-got-it-right/story-e6frg6nf-1225812246120 |title=Discovery proves maligned navigator got it right |last=Fraser |first=Andrew |date=21 December 2009 |work=The Australian |page=3 |accessdate=21 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 November 2010, Mearns was awarded an honorary [[Medal of the Order of Australia]] in recognition of his work in locating and analyzing the wrecks of H.M.A.S. ''Sydney'' and A.H.S. ''Centaur''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/shipwreck-finder-gets-honorary-order-of-australia.htm |title=Shipwreck finder gets honorary OAM |last=Smith |first=Aaron |date=4 November 2010 |work=Australian Geographic |accessdate=5 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106075341/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/shipwreck-finder-gets-honorary-order-of-australia.htm |archivedate=6 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 March 2015 Mearns was part of a team led by [[Microsoft]] co-founder [[Paul Allen]] which located the wreck of the Japanese battleship ''[[Japanese battleship Musashi|Musashi]]'' in the [[Sibuyan Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/video-sunken-japan-wwii-warship-musashi-paul-allen-research-team/|title=Live video feed of sunken Japan WWII warship Musashi by Paul Allen research team|date=13 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 March 2015, Mearns jointly announced with the Ministry of Heritage &amp; Culture of the Government of [[Oman]] the discovery of a shipwreck from [[Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama's]] 1502-1503 Armada to India. The wreck is believed to be the Portuguese ''nau Esmeralda'' that was commanded by Vicente Sodré the maternal uncle of Vasco da Gama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esmeraldashipwreck.com|title=Vasco da Gama shipwreck Esmeralda near Oman from Vasco da Gama fleet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having sunk in May 1503, the ''Esmeralda'' is believed to be the earliest ship from Europe's Age of Discovery ever to be found and excavated by archaeologists. Mearns published a paper, with co-authors D. Parham and B. Frohlich, on the discovery in the International Journal of Nautical Archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mearns|first1=David|title=A Portuguese East Indiaman from the 1502–1503 Fleet of Vasco da Gama off Al Hallaniyah Island, Oman: an interim report|journal=International Journal of Nautical Archaeology|date=14 March 2016|volume=46|issue=2|pages=1–21|doi=10.1111/1095-9270.12175|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1095-9270.12175/full|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10899">The '''Dwight H. Terry Lectureship''', also known as the '''Terry Lectures''', was established at [[Yale University]] in 1905&lt;ref name="yale"&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/terrylecture/ Yale University - "Dwight H. Terry Lectureship"]&lt;/ref&gt; by a gift from Dwight H. Terry of [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]]. Its purpose is to engage both scholars and the public in a consideration of religion from a [[humanitarian]] point of view, in the light of modern science and philosophy.  The subject matter has historically been similar to that of the [[Gifford Lectures]] in Scotland, and several lecturers have participated in both series.

==Establishment of the Lectureship==
The 1905 deed of gift establishing the lectureship states:

{{cquote|The object of this foundation is not the promotion of scientific investigation and discovery, but rather the assimilation and interpretation of that which has been or shall be hereafter discovered, and its application to human welfare, especially by the building of the truths of science and philosophy into the structure of a broadened and purified religion. The founder believes that such a religion will greatly stimulate intelligent effort for the improvement of human conditions and the advancement of the race in strength and excellence of character. To this end it is desired that a series of lectures be given by men eminent in their respective departments, on ethics, the history of civilization and religion, biblical research, all sciences and branches of knowledge which have an important bearing on the subject, all the great laws of nature, especially of evolution ... also such interpretations of literature and sociology as are in accord with the spirit of this foundation, to the end that the Christian spirit may be nurtured in the fullest light of the world’s knowledge and that mankind may be helped to attain its highest possible welfare and happiness upon this earth.&lt;ref name="yup"&gt;[http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/SeriesPage.asp?Series=81 Yale University Press - "The Terry Lectures Series"]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although commitment to the gift was made in 1905 it did not mature until 1923, which is when the first Terry lectures were held.

==Lecture format==
The lectures are free and open to the public.  A single installment generally consists of four lectures by the same visiting scholar, given over the course of a month or less.  Many of the lectures have been edited into books published by the [[Yale University Press]], and remain in print to this day (see below)  Since 1999, the lectures have been recorded and archived on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100411232503/http://www.yale.edu/terrylecture/past_00-04.html Terry Lectures website] as audio and/or video streams.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8426">[[File:Ecological Pyramid.svg|thumb|An energy pyramid is a presentation of the trophic levels in an ecosystem. Energy from the sun is transferred through the ecosystem by passing through various trophic levels. Roughly 10% of the energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next, thus preventing a large number of trophic levels. There must be higher amounts of biomass at the bottom of the pyramid to support the energy and biomass requirements of the higher trophic levels.]]
An '''ecological pyramid''' (also '''trophic pyramid''', '''eltonian pyramid''', '''energy pyramid''', or sometimes '''food pyramid''') is a graphical representation designed to show the [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] or [[Primary production|bio productivity]] at each [[trophic level]] in a given [[ecosystem]].

''Biomass pyramids'' show how much biomass (the amount of living or organic matter present in an organism) is present in the organisms at each trophic level, while ''productivity pyramids'' show the procreation or turnover in biomass. There is also ''pyramid of numbers'' which represent the number of organisms in each trophic level. They may be upright (e.g. Grassland ecosystem), inverted (parasitic ecosystem) or dumbbell shaped (forest ecosystem).

Energy pyramids begin with [[autotroph|producers]] on the bottom (such as plants) and proceed through the various trophic levels (such as herbivores that eat plants, then carnivores that eat flesh, then omnivores that eat both plants and flesh, and so on).  The highest level is the [[Apex predator|top]] of the [[food chain]].

==History==
The concept of pyramid of numbers ("Eltonian pyramid") was developed by [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]] (1927).&lt;ref&gt;Elton, C. 1927. ''Animal Ecology''. New York, Macmillan Co. [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/7435#/summary link].&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it would also be expressed in terms of biomass by [[Shimon Fritz Bodenheimer|Bodenheimer]] (1938).&lt;ref&gt;Bodenheimer, F. S. 1938. ''Problems of Animal Ecology''. Oxford University Press. [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.218303 link].&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of pyramid of productivity or energy relies on works of [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]] and [[Raymond Lindeman]] (1942).&lt;ref name="lindeman_1942"&gt;Lindeman, R. L. (1942). The trophic-dynamic aspect of ecology. ''Ecology'' 23: 399–418. [http://www.fcnym.unlp.edu.ar/catedras/ecocomunidades/Lindman_1942.pdf link].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trebilco, R., Baum, J.K., Salomon, A.K., Dulvy, N.K. 2013. Ecosystem ecology: size-based constraints on the pyramids of life. ''Trends Ecol. Evol.'' 28, 423–431. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267279432_Understanding_Eltonian_biomass_pyramids_with_size-based_ecological_theory#pf8 link].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pyramid of numbers==
[[File:Numbers Pyramid.svg|thumb|A numbers pyramid shows the relevant number of organisms that each trophic level occupies in an ecosystem. Often, there are more producers than consumers, however, it can also be seen in many ecosystems that there are more primary consumers than producers.]]

A "pyramid of numbers" shows graphically the population of each level in a food chain. It is an upright pyramid given in an ecosystem, where usually the producers are more in number than any other [[Trophic level]]. This shows the number of organisms in each trophic level without any consideration for their size. This type of pyramid can be convenient, as counting is often a simple task and can be done over the years to observe the changes in a particular ecosystem. However, some types of organisms are difficult to count, especially when it comes to some juvenile forms. Unit: number of organisms.

==Pyramid of biomass== 
[[File:Biomass Pyramid.svg|thumb|A biomass pyramid shows the total mass of the organisms that each trophic level occupies in an ecosystem. Usually, producers have a higher biomass than any other trophic level, but there can be lower amounts of biomass at the bottom of the pyramid if the rate of primary production per unit biomass is very fast.]]

A "pyramid of biomass" shows the relationship between biomass and trophic level by quantifying the biomass present at each trophic level of an [[biocoenosis|energy community]] at a particular time. It is a graphical representation of biomass (total amount of living or organic matter in an ecosystem) present in unit area in different tropic levels. Typical units are grams per meter&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or calories per meter&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
The pyramid of biomass may be "inverted". For example, in a pond ecosystem, the [[standing crop]] of [[phytoplankton]], the major [[autotrophs|producers]], at any given point will be lower than the mass of the [[heterotrophs]], such as fish and insects. This is explained as the phytoplankton [[reproduce]] very quickly, but have much shorter individual lives.

One problem with biomass pyramids is that they can make a trophic level appear to contain more [[energy]] than it actually does. For example, all [[birds]] have [[beak]]s and [[skeleton]]s, which despite having [[mass]] are not typically digested by the next trophic level.

==Pyramid of Energy==
A "pyramid of productivity" is often more useful, showing the production or turnover (the rate at which energy or mass is transferred from one trophic level to the next) of biomass at each trophic level. Instead of showing a single snapshot in time, [[primary production|productivity]] pyramids show the flow of [[energy]] through the [[food chain]]. Typical units are grams per meter&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per year or calories per meter&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per year. As with the others, this graph shows producers at the bottom and higher trophic levels on top.

When an ecosystem is healthy, this graph produces a standard ''ecological pyramid''. This is because in order for the ecosystem to sustain itself, there must be more energy at lower trophic levels than there is at higher trophic levels. This allows organisms on the lower levels to not only to maintain a stable population, but also to transfer energy up the pyramid. The exception to this generalization is when portions of a [[food web]] are supported by inputs of resources from outside the local [[biocoenosis|community]]. In small, forested streams, for example, the volume of higher levels is greater than could be supported by the local [[primary production]].

When energy is transferred to the next trophic level, typically only 10% or 12% of it is used to build new biomass, becoming stored energy (the rest going to metabolic processes) (Pauly and Christensen, 1995). In this case, in the ''pyramid of productivity'' each step will be 10% the size of the previous step (100,000, 10,000, 1,000, 100, 10, 1, .1, .01).

The advantages of the ''pyramid of productivity'' as a representation:
* It takes account of the rate of production over a period of time.
* Two species of comparable biomass may have very different [[life expectancy|life spans]]. Thus a direct comparison of their total biomasses is misleading, but their productivity is directly comparable.
* The relative energy chain within an ecosystem can be compared using pyramids of energy; also different [[ecosystems]] can be compared.
* There are no inverted pyramids.
* The input of solar energy can be added.

The disadvantages of the ''pyramid of productivity'' as a representation:
* The rate of biomass production of an organism is required, which involves measuring growth and reproduction through time.
* There is still the difficulty of assigning the organisms to a specific trophic level. As well as the organisms in the [[food chain]]s there is the problem of assigning the [[decomposers]] and [[detritivore]]s to a particular trophic level.

Nonetheless, [[productivity]] pyramids usually provide more insight into an [[biocoenosis|ecological community]] when the necessary information is available.

'''Electrocoagulation''' (EC), aka '''radio frequency diathermy''' or '''short wave electrolysis,''' is a technique used for wash water treatment, [[wastewater]] treatment, industrial processed water, and medical treatment. Electrocoagulation has become a rapidly growing area of wastewater treatment due to its ability to remove contaminants that are generally more difficult to remove by filtration or [[Chemical addition wastewater treatment|chemical treatment]] systems, such as emulsified oil, [[total petroleum hydrocarbon]]s, refractory organics, [[suspended solids]], and [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]]. There are many brands of electrocoagulation devices available and they can range in complexity from a simple anode and cathode to much more complex devices with control over electrode potentials, passivation, anode consumption, cell REDOX potentials as well as the introduction of ultrasonic sound, ultraviolet light and a range of gases and reactants to achieve so-called Advanced Oxidation Processes for [[refractory]] or ''recalcitrant'' organic substances.

A fine wire probe or other delivery mechanism is used to transmit [[radio waves]] to [[Biological tissue|tissues]] near the probe. Molecules within the tissue are caused to vibrate which lead to a rapid increase of the temperature, causing [[coagulation]] of the [[proteins]] within the tissue, effectively killing the tissue. At higher powered applications, full [[desiccation]] of tissue is possible.

== Water treatment ==
With the latest technologies, reduction of electricity requirements, and miniaturization of the needed power supplies, EC systems have now become affordable for water treatment plants and industrial processes worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;OilTrap Environmental Products, Tumwater, WA. [http://www.oiltrap.com/systems-and-technology/wash-water-treatment-system "Wash Water Treatment System."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227130317/http://www.oiltrap.com/systems-and-technology/wash-water-treatment-system |date=2011-12-27 }} Accessed 2012-12-05.&lt;/ref&gt; {{third-party-inline|date=December 2012}}

=== Background ===
Electrocoagulation ("electro", meaning to apply an electrical charge to water, and "coagulation", meaning the process of changing the particle surface charge, allowing suspended matter to form an agglomeration) is an advanced and economical water treatment technology. It effectively removes suspended solids to sub-micrometre levels, breaks emulsions such as oil and grease or latex, and oxidizes and eradicates heavy metals from water without the use of filters or the addition of separation chemicals &lt;ref&gt;Noling, Calvin (2004-07-01). [http://www.waterworld.com/index/display/article-display/211070/articles/industrial-waterworld/volume-5/issue-4/product-focus/new-electrocoagulation-system-addressesbrchallenges-of-industrial-storm-wash-water.html "New Electrocoagulation System Addresses Challenges of Industrial Storm, Wash Water."] ''WaterWorld.'' PennWell Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide range of wastewater treatment techniques are known, which includes biological processes for [[nitrification]], denitrification and [[phosphorus]] removal, as well as a range of physico-chemical processes that require chemical addition. The commonly used physico-chemical treatment processes are [[filtration]], [[air stripping]], [[ion exchange]], [[Precipitation (chemistry)|chemical precipitation]], chemical [[oxidation]], carbon [[adsorption]], [[ultrafiltration]] (UF), [[reverse osmosis]] (RO), [[electrodialysis]], [[volatilization]], and gas stripping.

===Benefits===
* Mechanical Filtration addresses only two issues in wash rack wash water: suspended solids larger than 30&amp;nbsp;µm, and free oil and grease. Emulsified oil and grease cause damage to the media filters, resulting in very high maintenance costs. Electrocoagulation addresses any size of suspended solids (including destructive &gt;30&amp;nbsp;µm particles and heavy metals that can wear-and-tear pressure washers and pose an environmental and employee hazard).
* Chemical treatment addresses suspended solids, oil and grease, and some heavy metals—but may require up to three polymer and multiple pH adjustments for proper treatment. This technology requires the addition of chemicals resulting in expensive, messy, and labor-intensive treatment. This process also requires addition of compressed air for floatation of coagulated contaminants. Generally filtration is also required as a post-treatment phase for polishing. Electrocoagulation requires no filters, no daily maintenance, no additives, and removes any size of suspended solids, oil, grease and heavy metals.

=== Technology ===
Treatment of wastewater and wash water by EC has been practiced for most of the 20th century with increasing popularity. In the last decade, this technology has been increasingly used in the United States, South America and Europe for treatment of industrial wastewater containing metals.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez J, Stopić S, Krause G, Friedrich B (2007). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/28801600066879m8/fulltext.pdf "Feasibility Assessment of Electrocoagulation Towards a New Sustainable Wastewater Treatment."] ''Environmental Science and Pollution Research'' 14 (7), pp. 477–482.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been noted that in North America EC has been used primarily to treat wastewater from [[paper pollution|pulp and paper]] industries, [[Industrial wastewater treatment#Mines and quarries|mining]] and [[Industrial wastewater treatment#Iron and steel industry|metal-processing]] industries. A large one-thousand gallon per minute cooling tower application in El Paso, Texas illustrates electrocoagulations growing recognition and acceptance to the industrial community. In addition, EC has been applied to treat water containing [[Industrial wastewater treatment#Food industry|foodstuff]] waste, oil wastes, dyes, output from public transit and marinas, wash water, ink, [[total suspended solids|suspended particles]], chemical and mechanical polishing waste, organic matter from [[landfill]] [[leachate]]s, [[defluorination]] of water, synthetic detergent effluents, and solutions containing heavy metals.&lt;ref&gt;Lai, C. L., Lin, S. H. 2003.

=== Coagulation process ===
Coagulation is one of the most important physio-chemical reactions used in water treatment. [[Ion]]s (heavy metals) and [[colloid]]s (organic and inorganic) are mostly held in solution by electrical charges. The addition of ions with opposite charges destabilizes the colloids, allowing them to coagulate. Coagulation can be achieved by a chemical coagulant or by electrical methods. [[Alum]] [Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;18[[water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]] is such a chemical substance, which has been widely used for ages{{When|date=February 2009}} for wastewater treatment.

The mechanism of coagulation has been the subject of continual review. It is generally accepted{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} that coagulation is brought about primarily by the reduction of the net surface charge to a point where the colloidal particles, previously stabilized by electrostatic repulsion, can approach closely enough for [[van der Waals force]]s to hold them together and allow aggregation. The reduction of the surface charge is a consequence of the decrease of the repulsive potential of the electrical double layer by the presence of an [[electrolyte]] having opposite charge. In the EC process, the coagulant is generated ''[[In situ#Chemistry and chemical engineering|in situ]]'' by electrolytic oxidation of an appropriate [[anode]] material. In this process, charged ionic species—metals or otherwise—are removed from wastewater by allowing it to react with an ion having an opposite charge, or with [[Flocculation|floc]] of metallic [[hydroxide]]s generated within the effluent.

Electrocoagulation offers an alternative to the use of metal [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] or [[polymer]]s and [[polyelectrolyte]] addition for breaking stable [[emulsion]]s and [[suspension (chemistry)|suspensions]]. The technology removes metals, colloidal solids and particles, and soluble inorganic pollutants from aqueous media by introducing highly charged polymeric metal hydroxide species. These species neutralize the electrostatic charges on suspended solids and oil droplets to facilitate agglomeration or coagulation and resultant separation from the aqueous phase. The treatment prompts the precipitation of certain metals and salts.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Chemical coagulation has been used for decades to destabilize suspensions and to effect precipitation of soluble metals species, as well as other inorganic species from aqueous streams, thereby permitting their removal through sedimentation or filtration. Alum, lime and/or polymers have been the chemical coagulants used. These processes, however, tend to generate large volumes of sludge with high bound water content that can be slow to filter and difficult to dewater. These treatment processes also tend to increase the [[total dissolved solids]] (TDS) content of the effluent, making it unacceptable for reuse within industrial applications."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Process Chemistry for Water and Wastewater Treatment |last1=Benefield |first1=Larry D. |last2=Judkins |first2=Joseph F.|last3=Weand |first3=Barron L. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1982 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |isbn=0-13-722975-5 |page=212 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Although the electrocoagulation mechanism resembles chemical coagulation in that the cationic species are responsible for the neutralization of surface charges, the characteristics of the electrocoagulated flock differ dramatically from those generated by chemical coagulation. An electrocogulated flock tends to contain less bound water, is more shear resistant and is more readily filterable" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Woytowich |first1=David L. |last2=Dalrymple |first2=C.W. |last3=Britton |first3=M.G.  |date=Spring 1993 |title=Electrocoagulation (CURE) Treatment of Ship Bilge Water for the US Coast Guard in Alaska |journal=Marine Technology Society Journal |publisher=Marine Technology Society, Inc. |location=Columbia, MD |volume=27 |issue=1 |page=92 |url=http://www.mtsociety.org |doi=  |issn=0025-3324}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Description ===
In its simplest form, an electrocoagulation reactor is made up of an electrolytic cell with one [[anode]] and one [[cathode]]. When connected to an external power source, the anode material will electrochemically [[Corrosion|corrode]] due to oxidation, while the cathode will be subjected to [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]].

An EC system essentially consists of pairs of conductive metal plates in parallel, which act as monopolar [[electrode]]s. It furthermore requires a [[direct current]] power source, a resistance box to regulate the [[Electric current|current]] density and a [[multimeter]] to read the current values. The conductive metal plates are commonly known as "sacrificial electrodes." The sacrificial anode lowers the [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] potential of the anode and minimizes the passivation of the cathode. The sacrificial anodes and cathodes can be of the same or of different materials.

The arrangement of monopolar electrodes with cells in series is electrically similar to a single cell with many electrodes and interconnections. In series cell arrangement, a higher potential difference is required for a given current to flow because the cells connected in series have higher resistance. The same current would, however, flow through all the electrodes. On the other hand, in parallel or bipolar arrangement the electric current is divided between all the electrodes in relation to the resistance of the individual cells, and each face on the electrode has a different polarity.

During [[electrolysis]], the positive side undergoes anodic reactions, while on the negative side, cathodic reactions are encountered. Consumable metal plates, such as [[iron]] or [[aluminum]], are usually used as sacrificial electrodes to continuously produce ions in the water. The released ions neutralize the charges of the particles and thereby initiate coagulation. The released ions remove undesirable contaminants either by chemical reaction and precipitation, or by causing the colloidal materials to coalesce, which can then be removed by flotation. In addition, as water containing colloidal particulates, oils, or other contaminants move through the applied electric field, there may be [[ionization]], electrolysis, [[hydrolysis]], and [[Radical (chemistry)|free-radical]] formation which can alter the physical and chemical properties of water and contaminants. As a result, the reactive and excited state causes contaminants to be released from the water and destroyed or made less soluble.

It is important to note that electrocoagulation technology cannot remove infinitely soluble matter. Therefore ions with molecular weights smaller than Ca&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt; or Mg&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt; cannot be dissociated from the aqueous medium.

=== Reactions within the electrocoagulation reactor ===
Within the electrocoagulation reactor, several distinct electrochemical reactions are produced independently. These are:

* '''Seeding''', resulting from the anode reduction of metal ions that become new centers for larger, stable, insoluble complexes that precipitate as complex metal ions.
* '''Emulsion Breaking''', resulting from the oxygen and hydrogen ions that bond into the water receptor sites of emulsified oil molecules creating a water-insoluble complex separating water from oil, driller's mud, dyes, inks and fatty acids etc.
* '''[[Halogen]] Complexing''', as the metal ions bind themselves to chlorines in a chlorinated hydrocarbon molecule resulting in a large insoluble complex separating water from [[pesticide]]s, [[herbicide]]s, chlorinated [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]s, etc.
* '''Bleaching''' by the oxygen ions produced in the reaction chamber oxidizes dyes, [[cyanide]]s, [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, biohazards, etc. Electron flooding of electrodes forced ions to be formed to carry charge into the water, thereby eliminating the polar effect of the water complex, allowing colloidal materials to precipitate and the current controlled ion transport between the electrodes creates an osmotic pressure that typically ruptures bacteria, cysts, and viruses.
* '''Oxidation Reduction''' reactions are forced to their natural end point within the reaction tank which speeds up the natural process of nature that occurs in wet chemistry, where concentration gradients and Solubility Products (KsP) are the chief determinants to enable reactions to reach stoichiometric completion. 
* '''Electrocoagulation Induced pH''' swings toward neutral.

=== Optimizing reactions ===
Careful selection of the reaction tank material is essential along with control of the current, flow rate and [[pH]]. Electrodes can be made of iron, aluminum, [[titanium]], [[graphite]] or other materials, depending upon the wastewater to be treated and the contaminants to be removed. Temperature and pressure appear to have only a  minor effect on the process.
 
In the EC process the water-contaminant mixture separates into a floating layer, a mineral-rich flocculated sediment, and clear water. The floating layer is generally removed by means of an overflow weir or similar removal method. The aggregated flocculent mass settles either in the reaction vessel or in subsequent settling tanks due to gravitational force.

Following removal to a sludge collection tank, it is typically dewatered to a semi-dry cake using a mechanical screw press. The clear, treated (supernatant) water is typically then pumped to a buffer tank for later disposal and/or reuse in the plant’s designated process.

=== Advantages ===
* EC requires simple equipment and is easy to operate with sufficient operational latitude to handle most problems encountered on running.
* Wastewater treated by EC gives palatable, clear, colorless and odorless water.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}
* Sludge formed by EC tends to be readily settable and easy to de-water, compared to conventional alum or ferric hydroxide sludges, because the mainly metallic oxides/hydroxides have no residual charge.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* Flocs formed by EC are similar to chemical floc, except that EC floc tends to be much larger, contains less bound water, is acid-resistant and more stable, and therefore, can be separated faster by filtration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Al-Shannag|first1=Mohammad|last2=Bani-Melhem|first2=Khalid|last3=Al-Anber|first3=Zaid|last4=Al-Qodah|first4=Zakaria|title=Enhancement of COD-Nutrients Removals and Filterability of Secondary Clarifier Municipal Wastewater Influent Using Electrocoagulation Technique|journal=Separation Science and Technology|date=January 2013|volume=48|issue=4|pages=673–680|doi=10.1080/01496395.2012.707729}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* EC can produce effluent with less TDS content as compared with chemical treatments, particularly if the metal ions can be precipitated as either hydroxides or carbonates (such as magnesium and calcium. EC generally has little if any impact on sodium and potassium ions in solution.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} 
* The EC process has the advantage of removing the smallest colloidal particles, because the applied electric field neutralises any residual charge, thereby facilitating the coagulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Al-Shannag|first1=Mohammad|last2=Bani-Melhem|first2=Khalid|last3=Al-Anber|first3=Zaid|last4=Al-Qodah|first4=Zakaria|title=Enhancement of COD-Nutrients Removals and Filterability of Secondary Clarifier Municipal Wastewater Influent Using Electrocoagulation Technique|journal=Separation Science and Technology|volume=48|issue=4|pages=673–680|doi=10.1080/01496395.2012.707729}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The EC process generally avoids excessive use of chemicals and so there is reduced requirement to neutralize excess chemicals and less possibility of secondary pollution caused by chemical substances added at high concentration as when chemical coagulation of wastewater is used.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* The gas bubbles produced during electrolysis can conveniently carry the pollutant components to the top of the solution where it can be more easily concentrated, collected and removed by a motorised skimmer.
* The electrolytic processes in the EC cell are controlled electrically and with no moving parts, thus requiring less maintenance.
* Dosing incoming waste water with [[sodium hypochlorite]] assists reduction of [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) and consequent [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD) although this should be avoided for wastewater containing high levels of organic compounds or dissolved ammonia (NH4+) due to formation of [[trihalogenated methanes]] (THMs) or other chlorinated organics. Sodium hypochlorite can be generated electrolytically in an E cell using platinum and similar inert electrodes or by using external electrochlorinators.&lt;ref&gt;United States Bureau of Reclamation. Yuma, AZ. [http://www.usbr.gov/lc/yuma/facilities/wqic/yao_wqic_research_chemical.html "Research Facilities and Test Equipment - Chemistry Research Units."] Updated 2012-07-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Due to the excellent EC removal of suspended solids and the simplicity of the EC operation, tests conducted for the U.S. [[Office of Naval Research]] concluded that the most promising application of EC in a [[Membrane technology|membrane system]] was found to be as pretreatment to a multi-membrane system of UF/RO or [[microfiltration]]/reverse osmosis (MF/RO). In this function the EC provides protection of the low-pressure membrane that is more general than that provided by chemical coagulation and more effective. EC is very effective at removing a number of membrane fouling species (such as silica, alkaline earth metal hydroxides and transition group metals) as well as removing many species that chemical coagulation alone cannot remove.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5112">'''Enterprise test [[software]]''' (ETS) is a type of [[software]] that [[electronics]] and other manufacturers use to standardize product testing enterprise-wide, rather than simply in the [[test engineer]]ing department. It is designed to integrate and synchronize test systems to other enterprise functions such as [[research and development]] (R&amp;D), [[new product introduction]] (NPI), [[manufacturing]], and [[supply chain]], overseeing the collaborative test processes between engineers and managers in their respective departments.

Like most [[enterprise software]] subcategories, ETS represents an evolution away from custom-made, in-house software development by [[original equipment manufacturer]]s (OEM). It typically replaces a cumbersome, unsophisticated, test management infrastructure that manufacturers have to redesign for every new product launch. Some large companies, such as [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]], [[Cisco]], and [[Nortel]], develop ETS systems internally to standardize and accelerate their test engineering activities, while others such as [[Harris Corporation]] and Freescale Semiconductor choose [[commercial off-the-shelf]] ETS options for advantages that include test data management and report generation. This need results from the extensive characterization efforts associated with IC design, characterization, validation, and verification. ETS accelerates design improvements through test system management and version control.

ETS supports test system development and can be interconnected with manufacturing execution services (MES), [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP), and [[product lifecycle management]] (PLM) software packages to eliminate double-data entry and enable [[Real-time computing|real-time]] information sharing throughout all company departments.

==Enterprise-wide test applications==

ETS covers five major enterprise-wide test applications.

*Test and automation—By using ETS in conjunction with [[virtual instrumentation]] [[programming tool]]s, design and test engineers avoid custom [[software programming]] unrelated to device characterization, and can thereby accelerate test system development.
*Product [[data management]]—In this application, the engineer collects, stores, aggregates, distributes, and shares product and test data in a central database. One significant advantage of ETS is reported to be product [[traceability]]. It is designed to make performance reporting easier, and to increase the chances that products are built correctly, from the first [[prototype]], reducing design iterations.
*[[Process control]]—The engineer manages the flow of activities between test, repair, and assembly stations, and enforces or suggests how a set of work instructions are to be applied. This application is designed to orchestrate product test strategies from [[Verification and Validation|validation]] to delivery.
*Multi-site collaboration—This purpose of this application is avoid [[time zone]] difficulties and error-prone updates of new product and test system releases, by sharing information with other departments and remote [[contract manufacturer]]s electronically. It is designed to offer real-time visibility over global test operations.
*Test asset management—This application is intended to help design and test engineers track [[product configuration]]s, tolerances, test sequences, and software being used by each test system, as well as distribute new updates electronically in real-time. Engineers can update their test systems automatically, in synch with their new releases.

'''Estonian Theatre and Music Museum''' is a national museum located in the old town of [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]].  The museum was established in 1924.&lt;ref name=Muuseum&gt;{{cite web|title=Estonian Theatre and Music Museum|url=http://www.muuseum.ee/en/muuseumid/eesti_muuseumid/keskmuuseumid?action=details&amp;museum_id=24|publisher=Muuseum|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Visit Estonia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Estonian Theatre and Music Museum|url=http://www.visitestonia.com/en/estonian-theatre-and-music-museum|publisher=Visit Estonia|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=all-about-estonia.com&gt;{{cite web|title=Information about national and thematic museums in Estonia|url=http://www.all-about-estonia.com/museums-in-estonia.html|publisher=all-about-estonia.com|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Estonian Theatre and Music Museum was established in 1924. Estonian music composer [[Peeter Süda]] made a huge collection of musical instruments, notes, books and other things. The purpose behind establishing this was preserving his collections.&lt;ref name=Culture.ee&gt;{{cite web|title=Estonian Theatre and Music Museum|url=http://www.culture.ee/location/estonian-theatre-and-music-museum|publisher=Culture.ee|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IYP&gt;{{cite web|title=Estonian Theatre &amp; Music Museum|url=http://www.inyourpocket.com/estonia/tallinn/sightseeing/museums/Estonian-Theatre-and-Music-Museum_7009v|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collection ==
The museum has a large collection of musical and theatrical instruments and props made by local craftsmen and made outside Estonia.&lt;ref name="Visit Estonia" /&gt; The museum has two main departments— music department and theatre department. The music department has musical instruments and hand-written songs and notes of notable music composers. The theatre department provides an overview of the Estonian theatre. There are collections of old theatre photos, costumes and documents. The museum has a separate library.&lt;ref name=Culture.ee /&gt;

Ethelwyn Manning (23 November 1885 – 1 June 1972) was the second Chief Librarian of the [[Frick Art Reference Library]]. During [[World War II]], she assisted the Committee of the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) on Protection of Cultural Treasures in War Areas, later known as the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]] (MFAA).

==Education==

Manning graduated from [[Smith College]] in 1908 and the school of Library Science at [[Simmons College]] in 1911. She also studied at the Training School for Children's Librarians at the [[Carnegie Library]], Pittsburgh.

==Career==

Manning began her career as a Children's Librarian at the [[Brooklyn Public Library]] in 1909. She subsequently held positions in the public libraries of [[Burlington, Iowa]], [[Cedar Rapids]], Iowa, and [[Milton, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;''Iowa Library Quarterly'' (1912). Volume 6, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, she was appointed Head Cataloger of the [[Amherst College]] Library in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;''Library Journal'' (1917). Volume 42 (February), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1924, Manning was appointed the second Chief Librarian of the Frick Art Reference Library, a research institute dedicated to promoting the study of art history and related subjects that had been founded four years earlier by [[Helen Clay Frick]] as a memorial to her father, the collector [[Henry Clay Frick]].&lt;ref&gt;Knox, Katharine McCook (1979). ''The Story of the Frick Art Reference Library: The Early Years''. New York: The Library, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Manning worked at the Frick Art Reference Library for twenty-four years, overseeing the institution's transfer from its original location in a two and one-half story building at 6 East 71st Street to its present thirteen story building located at 10 East 71st Street.&lt;ref&gt;Knox (1979), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, when the Committee of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] (ACLS) on Protection of Cultural Treasures in War Areas was in residence at the Library, she worked alongside art historians on the Committee to prepare maps detailing the location of art treasures and landmarks in war zones and in danger of Nazi plundering. Manning was also instrumental in developing the institution's collection of study photographs of works of art, acquiring thousands of reproductions from European photographers and hiring photographers in the United States to travel through the country and photograph inaccessible paintings in private collections.&lt;ref&gt; Knox (1979), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting collection, which presently comprises more than one million images, documents the Western artistic tradition.&lt;ref&gt; Frick Art Reference Library Photoarchive: Holdings (2015). http://www.frick.org/research/photoarchive/holdings. Retrieved 15 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2277">[[File:Genetic Information Research Institute (logo).png|Genetic Information Research Institute logo|frame]]The '''Genetic Information Research Institute (GIRI)''' is a non-profit institution that was founded in 1994 by [[Jerzy Jurka]]. The mission of the institute "is to understand biological processes which alter the genetic makeup of different organisms, as a basis for potential gene therapy and genome engineering techniques."[https://web.archive.org/web/19981203120148/http://www.girinst.org/] The institute specializes in applying computer tools to analysis of [[DNA]] and [[protein]] sequence information. GIRI develops and maintains Repbase Update, a [[database]] of prototypic [[sequences]] representing [[repetitive DNA]] from different [[eukaryotic]] species, and Repbase Reports, an electronic journal established in 2001 [http://www.girinst.org/repbase/index.html]. Repetitive DNA is primarily derived from [[transposable elements]] (TEs), which include DNA [[transposons]] belonging to around 20 superfamilies and [[retrotransposons]] that can also be sub-classified into subfamilies . The majority of known superfamilies of DNA [[transposons]] were discovered or co-discovered at GIRI, including [[Helitron (biology)]], ''Academ, Dada, Ginger, Kolobok, Novosib, Sola, Transib, Zator, PIF/Harbinger'' and ''Polinton/Maverick''. An ancient element from the ''Transib'' superfamily was identified as the evolutionary precursor of the [[Recombination activating gene]]. GIRI has hosted three international conferences devoted to the genomic impact of eukaryotic transposable elements [http://www.girinst.org/conference/index.html].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2300">The '''Glasgow Chronology''' is a proposed revision of the [[Egyptian chronology]] of [[ancient Egypt]]. It was first formulated between the years 1978 and 1982 by a working group following the Glasgow Conference of Society for Interdisciplinary Studies (SIS, a non-profit organization advocating serious academic analysis of the writings of [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] and other [[catastrophism|catastrophist]]s).&lt;ref name=Sweeney&gt;{{cite book|title=Empire of Thebes, or, Ages in chaos revisited|author=Emmet John Sweeney|pages=19|publisher=Algora Publishing|year=2007| isbn=9780875864808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[chronology]] placed the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt]] some five hundred years later than the [[conventional chronology of Egypt]].

==Chronology formation==
The Glasgow Chronology was initially presented at an SIS conference, held in 1978 in [[Glasgow]] and entitled "Ages in Chaos?". Flaws were pointed out in it almost immediately, and by the 1980s its original proponents had all abandoned it, in favour of other chronologies.&lt;ref name=Sweeney /&gt;

The Glasgow Chronology accepted all the character identifications proposed by [[Velikovsky]] in ''[[Ages in Chaos]]'' (1952). Thus [[Hatshepsut]], who visited the Divine Land, was equated with the [[Queen of Sheba]], who visited [[Solomon]] in [[Jerusalem]], whilst [[Thutmose III]], who followed Hatshepsut, was equated with [[Shishak]], who plundered the Jerusalem temple after the death of Solomon. Velikovsky therefore reduced the age of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty]] by five centuries. However, in his subsequently published ''Ramses II and his Time'' (1978), he brought the Nineteenth dynasty down by roughly seven centuries, thus opening a two-century gap between the Eighteenth and Nineteenth dynasties. Despite the Glasgow Chronology intent of reducing the age of the Nineteenth dynasty by five centuries and allowing it to naturally follow from the Eighteenth dynasty, its original proponents concluded that it was historically insupportable.

'''''Gulliver's Travels''''', or '''''Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World. In Four Parts. By Lemuel Gulliver, First a Surgeon, and then a Captain of Several Ships''''' (which is the full title), is a prose [[satire]]&lt;ref name="DeMaria Jr"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swift|first1=Jonathan|editor1-last=DeMaria|editor1-first=Robert J=Gulliver's Travels|date=2003|publisher=Penguin|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=I-Narrators&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swift|first1=Jonathan|editor1-last=Rawson|editor1-first=Claude|editor1-link=Swift's 'I' Narrators|title=Gulliver's Travels|date=2009|publisher=W.

Norton|isbn=978-0-393-93065-8|page=875}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Irish people|Irish]] writer and clergyman [[Jonathan Swift]], that is both a satire on [[human nature]] and the [[travel literature|"travellers' tales"]] literary subgenre. It is Swift's best known full-length work, and a classic of [[English literature]]. He himself claimed that he wrote ''Gulliver's Travels'' "to vex the world rather than divert it".

The book became popular as soon as it was published. [[John Gay]] wrote in a 1726 letter to Swift that "It is universally read, from the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] [[council]] to the nursery."&lt;ref&gt;''Gulliver's Travels: Complete, Authoritative Text with Biographical and Historical Contexts'', Palgrave Macmillan 1995 (p. 21). The quote has been misattributed to Alexander Pope, who wrote to Swift in praise of the book just a day earlier.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Robert McCrum]] released his selection list of 100 best novels of all time where ''Gulliver’s Travels'', a satirical masterpiece, is listed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/17/the-100-best-novels-written-in-english-the-full-list|title=The 100 best novels written in English: the full list|accessdate=17 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part I: A Voyage to Lilliput===
;4 May 1699&lt;ref&gt;e="Project Gutenberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/w/captcha/question/|title=Project Gutenberg|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gulliver in Liliput, Bremen.jpg|thumb|Mural depicting Gulliver surrounded by citizens of Lilliput.]]
The travel begins with a short preamble in which [[Lemuel Gulliver]] gives a brief outline of his life and history before his voyages.

During his first voyage, Gulliver is washed ashore after a shipwreck and finds himself a prisoner of a race of tiny people, less than {{convert|6|in|cm}} tall, who are inhabitants of the island country of [[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliput]]. After giving assurances of his good behaviour, he is given a residence in Lilliput and becomes a favourite of the Lilliput [[Court (royal)|Royal Court]]. He is also given permission by the King of Lilliput to go around the city on condition that he must not harm their subjects.

At first, the Lilliputians are hospitable to Gulliver, but they are also wary of the threat that his size poses to them. The Lilliputians reveal themselves to be a people who put great emphasis on trivial matters. For example, which end of an egg a person cracks becomes the basis of a deep political rift within that nation. They are a people who revel in displays of authority and performances of power. Gulliver assists the Lilliputians to subdue their neighbours the Blefuscudians by stealing their fleet. However, he refuses to reduce the island nation of Blefuscu to a province of Lilliput, displeasing the King and the royal court.

Gulliver is charged with treason for, among other crimes, urinating in the capital though he was putting out a fire. He is convicted and sentenced to be blinded. With the assistance of a kind friend, "a considerable person at court", he escapes to Blefuscu. Here, he spots and retrieves an abandoned boat and sails out to be rescued by a passing ship, which safely takes him back home.

Gulliver soon sets out again. When the sailing ship ''Adventure'' is blown off course by storms and forced to sail for land in search of fresh water, Gulliver is abandoned by his companions and is left on a peninsula on the western coast of the [[North American]] continent.

The grass of that land is as tall as a tree. He is then found by a farmer who was about 72&amp;nbsp;ft (22 m) tall, judging from Gulliver estimating a man's step being {{convert|10|yd|m|0}}. He brings Gulliver home and the farmer's daughter [[Glumdalclitch]] cares for Gulliver. The [[Giant (mythology)|giant]]-sized farmer treats him as a curiosity and exhibits him for money. After a while the constant shows make Gulliver sick, and the farmer sells him to the queen of the realm. Glumdalclitch (who accompanied her father while exhibiting Gulliver) is taken into the Queen of [[Brobdingnag]]'s service to take care of the tiny man. Since Gulliver is too small to use their huge chairs, beds, knives and forks, the Queen of Brobdingnag commissions a small house to be built for him so that he can be carried around in it; this is referred to as his "travelling box".

Between small adventures such as fighting giant [[wasp]]s and being carried to the roof by a [[monkey]], he discusses the state of Europe with the King of Brobdingnag. The King is not happy with Gulliver's accounts of Europe, especially upon learning of the use of guns and cannons. On a trip to the seaside, his traveling box is seized by a giant eagle which drops Gulliver and his box into the sea where he is picked up by some sailors who return him to England.

[[File:Laputa - Grandville.jpg|thumb|upright|Gulliver discovers Laputa, the flying island (illustration by [[Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard Grandville|J. J. Grandville]])]]
Setting out again, Gulliver's ship is attacked by [[Piracy|pirates]] and he is [[Marooning|marooned]] close to a desolate rocky island near India. He is rescued by the [[Floating island (fiction)|flying island]] of [[Laputa]], a kingdom devoted to the arts of music, mathematics, and astronomy but unable to use them for practical ends. Rather than use armies, Laputa has a custom of throwing rocks down at rebellious cities on the ground.

Gulliver tours [[Balnibarbi]], the kingdom ruled from Laputa, as the guest of a low-ranking courtier and sees the ruin brought about by the blind pursuit of science without practical results, in a satire on bureaucracy and on the [[Royal Society]] and its experiments. At the Grand Academy of [[Lagado]] in Balnibarbi, great resources and manpower are employed on researching completely preposterous schemes such as extracting sunbeams from cucumbers, softening marble for use in pillows, learning how to mix paint by smell, and uncovering political conspiracies by examining the excrement of suspicious persons (see [[Muckraker|muckraking]]). Gulliver is then taken to [[Maldonada (Gulliver's Travels)|Maldonada]], the main port of Balnibarbi, to await a trader who can take him on to Japan.

While waiting for a passage, Gulliver takes a short side-trip to the island of [[Glubbdubdrib]] which is southwest of Balnibarbi. On Glubbdubdrib, he visits a magician's dwelling and discusses history with the ghosts of historical figures, the most obvious restatement of the "ancients versus moderns" theme in the book. The ghosts consist of [[Julius Caesar]], [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]], [[Homer]], [[Aristotle]], [[René Descartes]], and [[Pierre Gassendi]].

On the island of [[Luggnagg]], he encounters the ''[[struldbrug]]s'', people who are immortal. They do not have the gift of eternal youth, but suffer the infirmities of old age and are considered legally dead at the age of eighty.

After reaching [[Japan in Gulliver’s Travels|Japan]], Gulliver asks the Emperor "to excuse my performing the ceremony imposed upon my countrymen of [[Fumi-e|trampling upon the crucifix]]", which the Emperor does. Gulliver returns home, determined to stay there for the rest of his days.

[[File:Gulliver u Hvajninimů - Grandville.jpg|thumb|Gulliver in discussion with Houyhnhnms (1856 illustration by [[J.J. Grandville]]).]]
Despite his earlier intention of remaining at home, Gulliver returns to sea as the captain of a [[wikt:merchantman|merchantman]], as he is bored with his employment as a surgeon. On this voyage, he is forced to find new additions to his crew whom he believes to have turned the rest of the crew against him. His crew then commits mutiny. After keeping him contained for some time, they resolve to leave him on the first piece of land they come across, and continue as pirates. He is abandoned in a landing boat and comes upon a race of hideous, deformed and savage humanoid creatures to which he conceives a violent antipathy. Shortly afterwards, he meets the [[Houyhnhnm]]s, a race of talking horses. They are the rulers while the deformed creatures that resemble human beings are called [[Yahoo (Gulliver's Travels)|Yahoos]].

Gulliver becomes a member of a horse's household and comes to both admire and emulate the Houyhnhnms and their way of life, rejecting his fellow humans as merely Yahoos endowed with some semblance of reason which they only use to exacerbate and add to the vices Nature gave them. However, an Assembly of the Houyhnhnms rules that Gulliver, a Yahoo with some semblance of reason, is a danger to their civilization and commands him to swim back to the land that he came from. Gulliver's "Master," the Houyhnhnm who took him into his household, buys him time to create a canoe to make his departure easier. After another disastrous voyage, he is rescued against his will by a Portuguese ship. He is disgusted to see that Captain Pedro de Mendez, whom he considers a Yahoo, is a wise, courteous, and generous person.

He returns to his home in England, but he is unable to reconcile himself to living among "Yahoos" and becomes a recluse, remaining in his house, largely avoiding his family and his wife, and spending several hours a day speaking with the horses in his stables.

==Composition and history==
It is uncertain exactly when Swift started writing ''Gulliver's Travels'' (much of the writing was done at Loughry Manor in [[Cookstown]], [[County Tyrone]], whilst Swift stayed there) but some sources{{which|date=August 2013}} suggest as early as 1713 when Swift, Gay, Pope, [[John Arbuthnot|Arbuthnot]] and others formed the [[Scriblerus Club]] with the aim of satirising popular literary genres. According to these accounts, Swift was charged with writing the memoirs of the club's imaginary author, Martinus Scriblerus, and also with satirising the "travellers' tales" literary subgenre. It is known from Swift's correspondence that the composition proper began in 1720 with the mirror-themed Parts I and II written first, Part IV next in 1723 and Part III written in 1724; but amendments were made even while Swift was writing ''[[Drapier's Letters]]''. By August 1725 the book was complete; and as ''Gulliver's Travels'' was a transparently anti-[[British Whig Party|Whig]] satire, it is likely that Swift had the manuscript copied so that his handwriting could not be used as evidence if a prosecution should arise, as had happened in the case of some of his Irish [[pamphlet]]s (the ''Drapier's Letters''). In March 1726 Swift travelled to London to have his work published; the manuscript was secretly delivered to the publisher [[Benjamin Motte]], who used five printing houses to speed production and avoid piracy.&lt;ref&gt;Clive Probyn, ''Swift, Jonathan (1667–1745)'', ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' ([[Oxford University Press]]: [[Oxford]], 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Motte, recognising a best-seller but fearing prosecution, cut or altered the worst offending passages (such as the descriptions of the court contests in Lilliput and the rebellion of [[Lindalino]]), added some material in defence of Queen Anne to Part II, and published it. The first edition was released in two volumes on 28 October 1726, priced at 8''s''. ''6''d.''&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Journal'' 28 Oct 1726, "This day is published".&lt;/ref&gt;

Motte published ''Gulliver's Travels'' anonymously, and as was often the way with fashionable works, several follow-ups (''Memoirs of the Court of Lilliput''), parodies (''Two Lilliputian Odes, The first on the Famous Engine With Which Captain Gulliver extinguish'd the Palace Fire...'') and "keys" (''Gulliver Decipher'd'' and ''Lemuel Gulliver's Travels into Several Remote Regions of the World Compendiously Methodiz'd'', the second by [[Edmund Curll]] who had similarly written a "key" to Swift's ''[[Tale of a Tub]]'' in 1705) were swiftly produced. These were mostly printed anonymously (or occasionally pseudonymously) and were quickly forgotten. Swift had nothing to do with them and disavowed them in Faulkner's edition of 1735. Swift's friend [[Alexander Pope]] wrote a set of five ''Verses on Gulliver's Travels'', which Swift liked so much that he added them to the second edition of the book, though they are rarely included.

===Faulkner's 1735 edition===
In 1735 an Irish publisher, [[George Faulkner]], printed a set of Swift's works, Volume III of which was ''Gulliver's Travels''. As revealed in Faulkner's "Advertisement to the Reader", Faulkner had access to an annotated copy of Motte's work by "a friend of the author" (generally believed to be Swift's friend Charles Ford) which reproduced most of the manuscript without Motte's amendments, the original manuscript having been destroyed. It is also believed that Swift at least reviewed proofs of Faulkner's edition before printing, but this cannot be proved. Generally, this is regarded as the ''[[Editio Princeps]]'' of ''Gulliver's Travels'' with one small exception. This edition had an added piece by Swift, ''A letter from Capt. Gulliver to his Cousin Sympson'', which complained of Motte's alterations to the original text, saying he had so much altered it that "I do hardly know mine own work" and repudiating all of Motte's changes as well as all the keys, libels, parodies, second parts and continuations that had appeared in the intervening years. This letter now forms part of many standard texts.

===Lindalino===
The five-paragraph episode in Part III, telling of the rebellion of the surface city of [[Lindalino]] against the flying island of Laputa, was an obvious allegory to the affair of ''[[Drapier's Letters]]'' of which Swift was proud. Lindalino represented [[Dublin]] and the impositions of Laputa represented the British imposition of [[William Wood (ironmaster)|William Wood]]'s poor-quality copper currency. Faulkner had omitted this passage, either because of political sensitivities raised by an Irish publisher printing an anti-British satire, or possibly because the text he worked from did not include the passage. In 1899 the passage was included in a new edition of the ''Collected Works''. Modern editions derive from the Faulkner edition with the inclusion of this 1899 addendum.

[[Isaac Asimov]] notes in ''The Annotated Gulliver'' that Lindalino is generally taken to be Dublin, being composed of double lins; hence, Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swift|first=Jonathan|editor=Isaac Asimov|title=The Annotated Gulliver's Travels|date=1980|publisher=Clarkson N Potter Inc|location=New York|isbn=0-517-539497|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swift's Gulliver- Voyage to Brobdingnag The Metropolitan Museum of Art edit.jpg|thumb|upright|''The King of Brobdingnag and Gulliver'' by [[James Gillray]] (1803), (satirising [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and [[George III of England|George III]]). [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
''Gulliver's Travels'' has been the recipient of several designations: from [[Menippean satire]] to a children's story, from proto-science fiction to a forerunner of the modern novel.

Published seven years after [[Daniel Defoe]]'s wildly successful ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', ''Gulliver's Travels'' may be read as a systematic rebuttal of Defoe's optimistic account of human capability. In ''The Unthinkable Swift: The Spontaneous Philosophy of a Church of England Man'', [[Warren Montag]] argues that Swift was concerned to refute the notion that the individual precedes society, as Defoe's novel seems to suggest. Swift regarded such thought as a dangerous endorsement of [[Thomas Hobbes]]' radical political philosophy and for this reason Gulliver repeatedly encounters established societies rather than desolate islands. The captain who invites Gulliver to serve as a surgeon aboard his ship on the disastrous third voyage is named Robinson.

Scholar Allan Bloom points out that Swift's critique of science (the experiments of Laputa) is the first such questioning by a modern liberal democrat of the effects and cost on a society which embraces and celebrates policies pursuing scientific progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Allan Bloom|title=Giants and Dwarfs: An Outline of Gulliver's Travels|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1990|location=New York|pages=47–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A possible reason for the book's classic status is that it can be seen as many things to many different people. Broadly, the book has three themes:
* A satirical view of the state of European government, and of petty differences between religions
* An inquiry into whether men are inherently corrupt or whether they become corrupted
* A restatement of the older "ancients versus moderns" controversy previously addressed by Swift in ''[[The Battle of the Books]]''

In storytelling and construction the parts follow a pattern:
* The causes of Gulliver's misadventures become more malignant as time goes on—he is first shipwrecked, then abandoned, then attacked by strangers, then attacked by his own crew.
* Gulliver's attitude hardens as the book progresses—he is genuinely surprised by the viciousness and politicking of the Lilliputians but finds the behaviour of the Yahoos in the fourth part reflective of the behaviour of people.
* Each part is the reverse of the preceding part—Gulliver is big/small/wise/ignorant, the countries are complex/simple/scientific/natural, and the forms of government are worse/better/worse/better than England's.
* Gulliver's viewpoint between parts is mirrored by that of his [[antagonist]]s in the contrasting part—Gulliver sees the tiny Lilliputians as being vicious and unscrupulous, and then the king of Brobdingnag sees Europe in exactly the same light; Gulliver sees the Laputians as unreasonable, and his Houyhnhnm master sees humanity as equally so.
* No form of government is ideal—the simplistic Brobdingnagians enjoy public executions and have streets infested with beggars, the honest and upright Houyhnhnms who have no word for lying are happy to suppress the true nature of Gulliver as a Yahoo and are equally unconcerned about his reaction to being expelled.
* Specific individuals may be good even where the race is bad—Gulliver finds a friend in each of his travels and, despite Gulliver's rejection and horror toward all Yahoos, is treated very well by the Portuguese captain, Don Pedro, who returns him to England at the novel's end.

Of equal interest is the character of Gulliver himself—he progresses from a cheery optimist at the start of the first part to the pompous [[misanthrope]] of the book's conclusion and we may well have to filter our understanding of the work if we are to believe the final misanthrope wrote the whole work. In this sense ''Gulliver's Travels'' is a very modern and complex novel. There are subtle shifts throughout the book, such as when Gulliver begins to see all humans, not just those in Houyhnhnm-land, as Yahoos. However, a feminist perspective of ''Gulliver's Travels'' argues that it is [[misogyny]], and not misanthropy, that is shown in Gulliver.&lt;ref name="1667-1745"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/31794911|title=Gulliver's travels : complete, authoritative text with biographical and historical contexts, critical history, and essays from five contemporary critical perspectives|last=1667-1745.|first=Swift, Jonathan,|others=Fox, Christopher, 1948-|isbn=9780312066659|location=Boston|oclc=31794911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout, Gulliver is presented as being gullible; he believes what he is told, never perceives deeper meanings, is an honest man, and expects others to be honest. This makes for fun and irony; what Gulliver says can be trusted to be accurate, and he does not always understand the meaning of what he perceives.

Also, although Gulliver is presented as a commonplace "[[everyman]]", lacking higher education, he possesses a remarkable natural gift for language. He quickly becomes fluent in the native tongue of any strange land in which he finds himself, a literary device that adds verisimilitude and humour to Swift's work.

Despite the depth and subtlety of the book, it is often classified as a children's story because of the popularity of the Lilliput section (frequently [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerised]]) as a book for children. One can still buy books entitled ''Gulliver's Travels'' which contain only parts of the Lilliput voyage.

=== Misogyny ===
A well-known underlying theme in ''Gulliver's Travels'' is misogyny. Swift uses satire to openly mock misogyny throughout the book, with one of the most cited examples of this coming from Gulliver's description of a Brobdingnagian woman:

"I must confess no Object ever disgusted me so much as the Sight of her monstrous Breast, which I cannot tell what to compare with, so as to give the curious Reader an Idea of its Bulk, Shape, and Colour.... This made me reflect upon the fair Skins of our ''English'' Ladies, who appear so beautiful to us, only because they are of our own Size, and their Defects not to be seen but through a magnifying glass...."

This open critique towards aspects of the female body is something that Swift often brings up in other works of his, particularly in poems such as ''The Lady's Dressing Room'' and ''A Beautiful Young Nymph Going To Bed''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Katharine M.|date=1959|title="MY FEMALE FRIENDS": THE MISOGYNY OF JONATHAN SWIFT|jstor=40753638|journal=Texas Studies in Literature and Language|volume=1|issue=3|pages=366–379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well known criticism of Swift's use of misogyny by Felicity A. Nussbaum proposes the idea that “Gulliver himself is a gendered object of satire, and his antifeminist sentiments may be among those mocked.” Gulliver’s own masculinity is often mocked, seen in how he is made to be a coward among the Brobdingnag people, repressed by the people of Lilliput, and viewed as an inferior Yahoo among the Houyhnhnms.&lt;ref name="1667-1745"/&gt;&lt;!--gender characteristics generate from deeply meaningful personal ethic differences expressly associated with grammatical gender. Popular historical literature more likely create gender as known today, than criticize gender as known today; even if somehow the literature criticized gender as known when authoring. Also, characters rarely form models of behavior unless those characters exhibit difficulty to perfectly imitate but-rather models of behavior form from veritable what-ifs tested in the reader's reality--&gt;

Another criticism of Swift's use of misogyny delves into Gulliver's repeated use of the word 'nauseous,' and the way that Gulliver is fighting his emasculation by commenting on how he thinks the women of Brobdingnag are disgusting.

"Swift has Gulliver frequently invoke the sensory (as opposed to reflective) word "nauseous" to describe this and other magnified images in Brobdingnag not only to reveal the neurotic depths of Gulliver's misogyny, but also to show how male nausea can be used as a pathetic countermeasure against the perceived threat of female consumption. Swift has Gulliver associate these magnified acts of female consumption with the act of "throwing-up" — the opposite of and antidote to the act of gastronomic consumption."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4625129|title=The Sexual Politics of Microscopy in Brobdingnag|last=Armintor|first=Deborah|date=2007|website=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This commentary of Deborah Needleman Armintor relies upon the way that the giant women do with Gulliver as they please, in much the same way as one might play with a toy, and get it to do everything one can think of.  Armintor's comparison focuses on the pocket microscopes that were popular in Swift's time.  She talks about how this instrument of science was transitioned to something toy-like and accessible, so it shifted into something that women favored, and thus men lose interest.  This is similar to the progression of Gulliver's time in Brobdingnag, from man of science to women's plaything.

=== Comic Misanthropy ===
[[Misanthropy]] is a theme that scholars have identified in ''Gulliver's Travels.''  Arthur Case, R.S. Crane, and Edward Stone discuss [[Lemuel Gulliver|Gulliver]]'s development of misanthropy and come to the consensus that this theme ought to be viewed as comical rather than cynical.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Case, Arthur E. “From ‘The Significance of ''Gulliver’s Travels''.’” ''A Casebook on Gulliver Among the Houyhnhnms'', edited by Milton P. Foster, Thomas Y. Crowell Company, 1961, pp. 139–47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Crane, R. S. “The Houyhnhnms, the Yahoos, and the History of Ideas.” ''Twentieth Century Interpretations of Gulliver’s Travels: A Collection of Critical Essays'', edited by Frank Brady, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., Prentice-Hall, 1968, pp. 80–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Stone, Edward. “Swift and the Horses: Misanthropy or Comedy?” ''A Casebook on Gulliver Among the Houyhnhnms'', edited by Milton P. Foster, Thomas Y. Crowell Company, 1961, pp. 180–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of Gulliver's development of misanthropy, these three scholars point to the fourth voyage.  According to Case, Gulliver is at first averse to identifying with the [[Yahoo (Gulliver's Travels)|Yahoos]], but, after he deems the [[Houyhnhnm]]s superior, he comes to believe that humans (including his fellow Europeans) are Yahoos due to their shortcomings.  Perceiving the Houyhnhnms as perfect, Gulliver thus begins to perceive himself and the rest of humanity as imperfect.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;  According to Crane, when Gulliver develops his misanthropic mindset, he becomes ashamed of humans and views them more in line with animals.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  This new perception of Gulliver's, Stone claims, comes about because the Houyhnhnms' judgement pushes Gulliver to identify with the Yahoos.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;  Along similar lines, Crane holds that Gulliver's misanthropy is developed in part when he talks to the Houyhnhnms about mankind because the discussions lead him to reflect on his previously held notion of humanity.  Specifically, Gulliver’s master, who is a Houyhnhnm, provides questions and commentary that contribute to Gulliver’s reflectiveness and subsequent development of misanthropy.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  However, Case points out that Gulliver's dwindling opinion of humans may be blown out of proportion due to the fact that he is no longer able to see the good qualities that humans are capable of possessing.  Gulliver’s new view of humanity, then, creates his repulsive attitude towards his fellow humans after leaving Houyhnhnmland.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;  But in Stone's view, Gulliver’s actions and attitude upon his return can be interpreted as misanthropy that is exaggerated for comic effect rather than for a cynical effect.  Stone further suggests that Gulliver goes mentally mad and believes that this is what leads Gulliver to exaggerate the shortcomings of humankind.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;  Over time, though, Gulliver is able to get used to humanity again.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Another aspect that Crane attributes to Gulliver’s development of misanthropy is that when in Houyhnhnmland, it is the animal-like beings (the Houyhnhnms) who exhibit reason and the human-like beings (the Yahoos) who seem devoid of reason; Crane argues that it is this switch from Gulliver’s perceived norm that leads the way for him to question his view of humanity.  As a result, Gulliver begins to identify humans as a type of Yahoo.  To this point, Crane brings up the fact that a traditional definition of man – ''Homo est animal rationale'' (Humans are rational animals) – was prominent in academia around [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]]’s time.  Furthermore, Crane argues that Swift had to study this type of logic (see [[Porphyrian tree|Porphyrian Tree]]) in college, so it is highly likely that he intentionally inverted this logic by placing the typically given example of irrational beings – horses – in the place of humans and vice versa.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Stone points out that ''Gulliver's Travels'' takes a cue from the genre of the travel book, which was popular during Swift's time period.  From reading travel books, Swift’s contemporaries were accustomed to beast-like figures of foreign places; thus, Stone holds that the creation of the Yahoos was not out of the ordinary for the time period.  From this playing off of familiar genre expectations, Stone deduces that the parallels that Swift draws between the Yahoos and humans is meant to be humorous rather than cynical.  Even though Gulliver sees Yahoos and humans as if they are one and the same, Stone argues that Swift did not intend for readers to take on Gulliver’s view; Stone states that the Yahoos’ behaviors and characteristics that set them apart from humans further supports the notion that Gulliver's identification with Yahoos is not meant to be taken to heart.  Thus, Stone sees Gulliver’s perceived superiority of the Houyhnhnms and subsequent misanthropy as features that Swift used to employ the satirical and humorous elements characteristic of the Beast Fables of travel books that were popular with his contemporaries; as Swift did, these Beast Fables placed animals above humans in terms of morals and reason, but they were not meant to be taken literally.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

===Character analysis===
'''Pedro de Mendez''' is the name of the Portuguese captain who rescues Gulliver in Book IV. When Gulliver is forced to leave the Island of the [[Houyhnhnms]], his plan is "to discover some small Island uninhabited" where he can live in solitude. Instead, he is picked up by Don Pedro's crew. Despite Gulliver's appearance—he is dressed in skins and speaks like a horse—Don Pedro treats him compassionately and returns him to Lisbon.

Though Don Pedro appears only briefly, he has become an important figure in the debate between so-called soft school and hard school readers of ''Gulliver's Travels''. Some critics contend that Gulliver is a target of Swift's satire and that Don Pedro represents an ideal of human kindness and generosity. Gulliver believes humans are similar to Yahoos in the sense that they make "no other use of reason, than to improve and multiply...vices" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gulliver's Travels|last=Swift|first=Jonathan|publisher=|year=1726|isbn=978-0-393-93065-8|location=|pages=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Pedro provides a contrast to Gulliver's reasoning, proving humans are able to reason, be kind, and most of all: civilized. Gulliver sees the bleak fallenness at the center of human nature, and Don Pedro is merely a minor character who, in Gulliver's words, is "an Animal which had some little Portion of Reason."&lt;ref&gt;James Clifford, "Gulliver's Fourth Voyage: 'hard' and 'soft' Schools of Interpretation."

From 1738 to 1746, [[Edward Cave]] published in occasional issues of ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' semi-fictionalized accounts of contemporary debates in the two Houses of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] under the title of ''Debates in the Senate of Lilliput''. The names of the speakers in the debates, other individuals mentioned, politicians and monarchs present and past, and most other countries and cities of Europe ("Degulia") and America ("Columbia") were thinly disguised under a variety of Swiftian pseudonyms. The disguised names, and the pretence that the accounts were really translations of speeches by Lilliputian politicians, were a reaction to an Act of Parliament forbidding the publication of accounts of its debates. Cave employed several writers on this series: [[William Guthrie (historian)|William Guthrie]] (June 1738&amp;nbsp;– November 1740), [[Samuel Johnson]] (November 1740&amp;nbsp;– February 1743), and [[John Hawkesworth (book editor)|John Hawkesworth]] (February 1743&amp;nbsp;– December 1746).

The astronomers of Laputa have discovered "two lesser stars, or satellites, which revolve about Mars".&lt;ref&gt;''Gulliver's Travels: Complete, Authoritative Text with Biographical and Historical Contexts'', Palgrave Macmillan 1995 (p. 21)&lt;/ref&gt; This may have influenced [[Voltaire]], whose 1750 story ''[[Micromégas]]'' also refers to two moons of Mars. In 1877, [[Asaph Hall]] discovered the two real moons of Mars, [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] and [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]]; in 1973 craters on Deimos were named [[Swift (Deimian crater)|Swift]] and [[Voltaire (crater)|Voltaire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Page/DEIMOS/target |work=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature |publisher=[[Astrogeology Research Program]], USGS |title=Target: Deimos |accessdate=28 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 2006 numerous features on Phobos were named after elements from ''Gulliver's Travels'', including Laputa [[Regio (astronomy)|Regio]], Lagado [[Planitia]], and several craters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Page/PHOBOS/target |work=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature |publisher=[[Astrogeology Research Program]], USGS |title=Target: Phobos |accessdate=28 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Lilliputian'' has entered many languages as an adjective meaning "small and delicate". There is even a brand of small cigar called Lilliput. There is a series of collectable model houses known as "Lilliput Lane". The smallest light bulb fitting (5mm diameter) in the [[Edison screw]] series is called the "Lilliput Edison screw". In Dutch and Czech, the words ''Lilliputter'' and ''liliput(á)n'' respectively are used for adults shorter than 1.30 meters. Conversely, ''Brobdingnagian'' appears in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] as a synonym for ''very large'' or ''gigantic''.

In like vein, the term ''yahoo'' is often encountered as a [[synonym]] for ''ruffian'' or ''thug''. In the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] it is considered a definition for "a rude, noisy, or violent person" and its origins attributed to Swift's ''Gulliver's Travels.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/yahoo#yahoo|title=yahoo - definition of yahoo in English - Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the discipline of [[computer architecture]], the terms [[endianness|''big-endian'' and ''little-endian'']] are used to describe two possible ways of laying out [[bytes]] in [[computer memory|memory]]. The terms derive from one of the satirical conflicts in the book, in which two religious sects of Lilliputians are divided between those who crack open their soft-boiled eggs from the little end, and those who use the big end, the "Big-endians".

[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoevsky]] references ''Gulliver's Travels'' in his novel ''[[Demons (Dostoyevsky novel)|Demons]]'' (1872): 'In an English satire of the last century, Gulliver, returning from the land of the Lilliputians where the people were only three or four inches high, had grown so accustomed to consider himself a giant among them, that as he walked along the Streets of London he could not help crying out to carriages and passers-by to be careful and get out of his way for fear he should crush them, imagining that they were little and he was still a giant....'

== Reception ==
The book was very popular upon release and was commonly discussed within social circles.&lt;ref&gt;Wiener, Gary, editor. “The Enthusiastic Reception of Gulliver's Travels.” Readings on Gulliver's Travels, Greenhaven Press, 2000, pp. 57–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Public reception widely varied, with the book receiving an initially enthusiastic reaction with readers praising its satire, and some reporting that the satire's cleverness sounded like a realistic account of a man's travels.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Gerace, Mary. “The Reputation of ‘Gulliver’s Travels’ in the Eighteenth Century.” ''University of Windsor'', 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Beattie (poet)|James Beattie]] commended Swift’s work for its “truth” regarding the narration and claims that “the statesman, the philosopher, and the critick, will admire his keenness of satire, energy of description, and vivacity of language,” noting that even children can enjoy the novel.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Lund, Roger D. ''Johnathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels: A Routledge Study Guide''. Routledge, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; As popularity increased, critics came to appreciate the deeper aspects of ''Gulliver’s Travels.'' It became known for its insightful take on morality, expanding its reputation beyond just humorous satire.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Despite its initial positive reception, the book faced backlash. One of the first critics of the book, referred to as Lord Bolingbroke, criticized Swift for his overt use of misanthropy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Other negative responses to the novel also looked towards its portrayal of humanity, which was considered inaccurate. Swifts’s peers rejected the novel on claims that its themes of misanthropy were harmful and offensive. They criticized its satire for exceeding what was deemed acceptable and appropriate, including the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos’s similarities to humans.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There was also controversy surrounding the political allegories. Readers enjoyed the political references, finding them humorous. However, members of the Whig party were offended, believing that Swift mocked their politics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

British journalist [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] described Swift’s novel as “blasphemous,” citing its critical view of mankind as ludicrous and overly harsh. He concludes his critique by remarking that he cannot understand the origins of Swift’s critiques on humanity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==In other works==

===Sequels and imitations===
* Many sequels followed the initial publishing of the ''Travels''. The earliest of these was the anonymously authored ''Memoirs of the Court of Lilliput'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZTRAAAAMAAJ|title=Memoirs of the Court of Lilliput|date=1 January 1727|publisher=J. Roberts|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; published 1727, which expands the account of Gulliver's stays in Lilliput and Blefuscu by adding several gossipy anecdotes about scandalous episodes at the Lilliputian court.
* Abbé [[Pierre Desfontaines]], the first French translator of Swift's story, wrote a sequel, ''Le Nouveau Gulliver ou Voyages de Jean Gulliver, fils du capitaine Lemuel Gulliver'' (The New Gulliver, or the travels of John Gulliver, son of Captain Lemuel Gulliver), published in 1730.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w6LRAAAAMAAJ|title=Le nouveau Gulliver: ou, Voyage de Jean Gulliver, fils du capitaine Gulliver|first1=Desfontaines (Pierre-François Guyot, M.|last1=l'abbé)|first2=Jonathan|last2=Swift|date=1 January 1730|publisher=La veuve Clouzier|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gulliver's son has various fantastic, satirical adventures.
* [[Donald Grant Mitchell]] retold part one of the novel in the form of a short story for children, published in ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine|St. Nicholas]]'' magazine in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;“[https://archive.org/stream/stnicholasserial01dodg#page/296/mode/2up About Some Queer Little People],” by Donald Grant Mitchell, ''St. Nicholas'', Mar. 1874, 296–99.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hungary|Hungarian]] author [[Frigyes Karinthy]] wrote two science fiction novellas that continue the adventures of Gulliver: ''[[Voyage to Faremido]]'' (1916) is an early examination of artificial intelligence, with a pacifist theme,&lt;ref name="sftey"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bleiler | first1 = E. F. | first2 = Bleiler | last2 = Richard | title = Science-Fiction: The Early Years | publisher = Kent State University Press | date = 1990 | location = | pages = 400–401 | isbn = 9780873384162 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Capillaria]]'' (1921) is a satire on the 'battle of the sexes'.&lt;ref name="sftey"/&gt;
* [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] science fiction writer [[Volodymyr Ivanovych Savchenko|Vladimir Savchenko]] published ''Gulliver's Fifth Travel—The Travel of Lemuel Gulliver, First a Surgeon, and Then a Captain of Several Ships to the Land of Tikitaks'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Пятое путешествие Гулливера – Путешествие Лемюэля Гулливера, сначала хирурга, а потом капитана нескольких кораблей, в страну тикитаков}}), a sequel to the original series in which Gulliver's role as a surgeon is more apparent. Tikitaks are people who inject the juice of a unique fruit to make their skin transparent, as they consider people with regular opaque skin secretive and ugly.
* {{nihongo|''[[Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon]]''|ガリバーの宇宙旅行|Garibā no Uchū Ryokō|Gulliver's Space Travels}} is a 1965 Japanese animated film, portraying an elder Gulliver taking part in a space travel, joined by a boy, a crow, a talking toy soldier and a dog. The film, although being a children's production generally fascinated by the idea of space travelling, portrays an alien world where robots have taken power. Thus it continues in Swift's vein of critical approach on themes in current society.
* [[Hanna-Barbera]] produced two adaptations of ''Gulliver's Travels'', one was an animated TV series called ''[[The Adventures of Gulliver]]'' from 1968 to 1969 and another was a 1979 animated television special titled ''[[Gulliver's Travels (1979 TV special)|Gulliver's Travels]]''.
* American physician John Paul Brady published in 1987 ''A Voyage to Inishneefa: A First-hand Account of the Fifth Voyage of Lemuel Gulliver'' (Santa Barbara: John Daniel), a parody of Irish history in Swift's manner.
* In 1998 the Argentine writer [[Edgar Brau]] published ''El último Viaje del capitán Lemuel Gulliver'' (The Last Voyage of Captain Lemuel Gulliver), a novel in which Swift's character goes on an imaginary fifth journey, this time into the River Plate. It satirises ways and customs of present-day society, including sports, television, politics, etc. To justify the parody, the narrative is set immediately after the last voyage written by Swift (precisely, 1722), and the literary style of the original work is kept throughout the whole story.

==Adaptations==
[[File:CC No 16 Gullivers Travels.jpg|thumb|upright|Comic book cover by Lilian Chesney]]

===Music===
* In 1728 the Baroque composer [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] composed a 5-movement suite for two violins based on Swift's book. Telemann's piece is commonly known as ''Gulliver's Travels,'' and depicts the Lilliputians and the Brobdingnagians particularly vividly through rhythms and tempos. The piece is part of Telemann's ''Der getreue Musik-meister'' (The Steadfast Music Teacher).
* The ambient band ''Soufferance'' based and themed their 2010 [[concept album]] on the book. Titled ''"Travels into Several Remote Nations of the Mind"'', the album featured a single, 65 minute song, bearing the title "The Thoughts and Memoirs of Mike Lachaire, First a Strange Individual, and then a Philosopher", referencing the full title of the original book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Julien|first1=Alexandre|title=Soufferance Bandcamp page|url=https://soufferance.bandcamp.com/album/travels-into-several-remote-nations-of-the-mind|website=Bandcamp|publisher=Abridged Pause Publishing|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"Polygondwanaland" 13th studio album by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard draws many connections among thematic interpretations thought the book and album.

[[File:Adoration des rois mages 1390 Herman von Munster 08947.JPG|thumb|Windows by Hermann von Münster&lt;ref&gt;http://www.persee.fr/doc/bulmo_0007-473x_1969_num_127_1_7094&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Hermann von Münster''' (c. 1330 - March 1392) was a German master glassmaker, native of [[Münster]], in [[Westphalia]], and active in [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]].

== Biography ==
Hermman von Münster  is actually the first stained glass artist to be mentioned by the archives of the Cathedral chapter of [[Metz Cathedral|Saint-Etienne]] of Metz. On August 29, 1381, master Hermann received an annuity of 22 [[Livre tournois|pounds]], to pay for its work on the western large window of the cathedral of Metz. His work was supported by Cardinal William Aigrefeuille, legate of the antipope [[Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]], who then reorganized the Chapter of Metz. Three years later, on 2 May 1384, the Cathedral chapter negotiated the price of the "GRANT OZ", the western [[Rose window]] with Hermann von Munster. Hermann was still working on the windows of the western facade in December 1384. In August 1385, the Cathedral Chapter borrowed 420 pounds to set the work completed.

In 1388, Hermann bought a home in Metz, beside the cathedral, where he died in March 1392. Thanks to his fame and to the excellent quality of his work, Hermann was buried in the aisle of the cathedral. An epitaph on the north wall of the cathedral indicates in [[old French]]:

CI DEVANT GIST&lt;br&gt;
MAISTRE HARMAN LI VALRIER&lt;br&gt;
DE MUNSTERE AN WAILTEFALLE,&lt;br&gt;
ET FIST LE GRANT OZ DE CEANS,&lt;br&gt;
QUI MORUT LE JOR DE LA NOSTRE DAME&lt;br&gt;
EN MARS M.CCC.IIIIXX et XII.&lt;ref&gt;Here, lies the master glassmaker Hermann, from Münster in Westphalia, who made the great rose window there, and died the day of Our Lady, in March 1392.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The only information known about Herman von Münster concerns of the [[Metz Cathedral|cathedral of Metz]], in particular the large western window of the nave of Metz.

== Technical overview ==
To [[came glasswork|assemble the window]], pieces of colored and painted glass were first laid out on the design board, with the edges of each piece fitted into H-shaped strips of lead. Then, these [[came]]s were soldered to one another. When a panel was completed, putty was inserted between the glass and the lead cames for waterproofing. The entire composition was then stabilized with an iron armature and mounted in the window.&lt;ref&gt;Stained Glass in Medieval Europe, Thematic Essay, Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, The Metropolitan Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stylistic influences ==
It seems that the style of Herman von Münster is to link to the [[Westphalia|Westphalian context]]. His work is close in style to the work of the master of [[Altenberg (Bergisches Land)|Altenberg]], near Münster. But the figures of the master of Altenberg are less expressive, and stricter. The characters in the bottom of the western windows of Metz, richly dressed, stand under colourful architectural niches. The use of thicker glass, with more sustained tones than in France, far from being an archaism, testifies of the influence that the medieval Rhenish style had on his work.

The '''Incoherents''' (''Les Arts incohérents'') was a short-lived French art movement founded by Parisian writer and publisher [[:fr:Jules Lévy|Jules Lévy]]&lt;sup&gt;(French)&lt;/sup&gt; (1857-1935) in 1882, which in its satirical irreverence anticipated many of the art techniques and attitudes later associated with [[avant-garde]] and [[anti-art]].  

Lévy coined the phrase ''les arts incohérents'' as a play on the common expression ''les arts décoratifs'' (i.e. arts &amp; crafts, but above all, a famous art school in Paris, the [[École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs|National School of Decorative Arts]]). The Incoherents presented work which was deliberately irrational and [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]], contained [[found objects]], was [[nonsense|nonsensical]], included humoristic sketchs, drawings of children, and drawings "made by people who don't know how to draw."  Lévy exhibited an all-black painting by poet [[Paul Bilhaud]] called ''Combat de Nègres dans un Tunnel'' (Negroes Fight in a Tunnel).  The early film animator [[Émile Cohl]] contributed photographs which would later be called [[surrealism|surreal]].  

[[File:Sapeck-La Joconde fumant la pipe.jpg|upright|thumb|''The Joconde smoking pipe'' by Sapeck, in ''[[Le Rire]]'', 1887.]] 

Although small and short-lived, the Incoherents were certainly well-known.  The movement sprang from the same [[Montmartre]] cabaret culture that spawned the [[Hydropathes]]  of [[Émile Goudeau]] and [[Alfred Jarry]]'s ''[[Ubu Roi]]''.  The October 1882 show was attended by two thousand people, including [[Manet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], [[Camille Pissarro]], and [[Richard Wagner]].  Beginning in 1883 there were annual shows, or masked balls, or both.  In an 1883 show, the artist [[:fr:Eugène Bataille (Sapeck)|Sapeck (Eugène Bataille)]]&lt;sup&gt;(French)&lt;/sup&gt; contributed ''Le rire,'' an "augmented" ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' smoking a pipe, that directly prefigures the famous [[Marcel Duchamp]] 1919 "appropriation" of the ''Mona Lisa'', ''[[L.H.O.O.Q.]]''.    

The movement wound down in the mid-1890s.

==History==
The Incoherent arts were born in the late nineteenth century, a period that was rich in scientific discoveries and social innovations. Cheeky and inventive, this time also marks a turning point in the field of art. The official art traditions were even being questioned in the newspapers through satirical images which implied it was a dying craft. It was in this creative lull that Jules Levy - former member of the literary club [[Hydropathes]] - decided to organize "an exhibition of drawings made by people who can not draw." This charitable carnival helped victims of a recent gas explosion to have an opportunity to present their works. The first "Incoherent arts" get-together, which took place on July 13, 1882 on the Champs Elysées hosts many curiosities. Taking advantage of a power outage, and lit only by candlelight, they created a jumble of rebellious works, using all types of materials and any inspiration with the ultimate goal of making people laugh. 

On October 2, 1882, Jules Lévy decided to repeat the experience at home. He gathered his friends under the pretense of having an "unusual evening". In his tiny apartment they worked under the phrase "Death to clichés, to us young people!" They received unexpected success and lots of newspaper coverage. As a result, the Incohérents arts movement became engrained into the Parisian cultural landscape. In October 1883 the Paris had its first official exhibition of Incoherent art, ran by local Galerie Vivienne. The purpose was charitable as with all Incoherent exhibits thereafter. A regulation 13-point proclamation was that "All the works are allowed, the serious works and obscene excepted". The exhibition adopts a true catalog, including a piece by Levy Orville in which he reverses an inkwell for the sake of aesthetics. The tone of the exhibition was set by an abundance of parodies and pictorial puns. More than 20,000 visitors took part over a month. 

A year later, the Incoherents returned to haunt the Galerie Vivienne with their cheeky pranks. They hoped this occasion would see the image of the "Chief pipes Poyle sand without number, on a silver field," an ancient statue carving chisel of an academician who does not lead wide.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} A catalog accompanied the exhibition with luxury engraved reproductions of most of the significant works. On its cover, a dancer brandishes a broom and scares away the gloom of black birds. The journalists accompanied the event with enthusiasm. The artists were increasingly familiarizing themselves with the pictorial map and the pun, both of which helped to establish this kind of "Incoherent" art. In 1886 the Incoherents at the Eden Theatre unveiled their new exhibit. Jules Chéret's poster included Levy going through the moon like a paper hoop. At the entrance, the rules regarding the event were framed prominently: "One goal you propose, laugh and cheer you frankly." The room was also full of visitors that worked in high, medium or low relief. Everything was recorded in catalog records which are decorated with "striking" portraits of exhibitors and zany references. 

In 1886 Jules Levy began to be the target of criticism. He was accused of using the Incoherent Arts for its own interests. He had in fact opened a publishing house in 1886 and published the works of his friends (Goudeau, Leroy, Monselet, etc..), illustrated by artists such as Boutet, Somm or Gray. He gradually lost the support of the French Courrier who had declared him as "the official unofficial Incoherent" in 1884. Meanwhile, some seeking to take advantage of the Incoherent movement by opening Incoherent cafes or established magazine operations, that the founders of the movement had nothing to do with. In 1887 Jules Levy promised the end of Inconsistency would be on April 16 of that year. A costume party was organized for the occasion with a [[Folies Bergère]] funeral procession. However, Incoherence has a brief renaissance on March 27, 1889 at a new dance held at the Eden Theatre. Levy wanted this event to remind the good memories of the Incoherent arts and to announce the return of his exhibitions. But in the spring of the 1889 exhibition he organized, while the Expo was in full swing in Paris, it was a fiasco. The press hardly covered the event, and even the [[French Courier]] remained silent. The Incoherent arts was no longer a novelty interest. Jules Levy, refusing to give up, created the magazine ''Folies Bergère'' in January 1891. Poorly organized, not repeated, the show is considered too long and the ball too short.
The last gasp of the inconsistency, his exhibition of 1893 had a brand new premise at Olympia, and passed almost unnoticed. Jules Blois of the French Mail wrote: "All that is outdated, outmoded. Inconsistency joined decadence, decay and other jokes with or without handles in the bag of old fashioned chiffes" Despite that, Levy still pulled on the Incoherent string until 1896 when it was met with massive indifference from the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.artsincoherents.info%2F | title=History of the Incoherent arts | publisher=Les Arts incohérents | accessdate=July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Institutional model theory''' generalizes a large portion of [[first-order logic|first-order]] [[model theory]] to an arbitrary [[logical system]].

== Overview ==
The notion of "logical system" here is formalized as an [[Institution (computer science)|institution]]. Institutions constitute a model-oriented meta-theory on logical systems similar to how the theory of [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]s and [[Module (mathematics)|module]]s constitute a meta-theory for classical [[linear algebra]]. Another analogy can be made with [[universal algebra]] versus [[Group (mathematics)|group]]s, [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, [[Module (mathematics)|module]]s etc. By abstracting away from the realities of the actual conventional logics, it can be noticed that institution theory comes in fact closer to the realities of non-conventional logics.

Institutional model theory analyzes and generalizes classical model-theoretic notions and results, like

* Elementary diagrams
* [[Elementary embedding]]s
* [[Ultraproduct]]s, [[Los' theorem]]
* [[Saturated model]]s
* [[Axiomatizable class|axiomatizability]]
* [[Variety (universal algebra)|Varieties]], [[Garrett Birkhoff|Birkhoff]] axiomatizability
* [[Craig interpolation]]
* [[Robinson's joint consistency theorem|Robinson consistency]]
* [[Evert Willem Beth|Beth]] definability
* [[Gödel]]'s [[completeness theorem]]

For each concept and theorem, the infrastructure and properties required are analyzed and formulated as conditions on institutions, thus providing a detailed insight on which properties of first-order logic they rely and how much they can be generalized to other logics.

==Nature==
The study of intercultural relations incorporates many different academic disciplines.  As a field, it is most closely tied to [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]], although a degree program in Intercultural Relations or Intercultural Studies may also include the study of [[history]], [[research]] methods, [[urban studies]], [[gender studies]], [[public health]], many various [[natural sciences]], [[human development (biology)|human development]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], [[religion]], [[missiology]], and [[linguistics]] or other language training.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Judith. Nakayama, Thomas. "Experiencing Intercultural Communication". McGraw Hill. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, Intercultural programs are designed to translate these academic disciplines into a practical training curricula.

{{Political anthropology}}
{{Anthropology |social/cultural}}

'''Legal anthropology''', also known as the '''anthropology of laws''', is a sub-discipline of [[anthropology]] which specializes in "the cross-cultural study of social ordering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Greenhouse, Carol J. |title=Praying for Justice: Faith, Order, and Community in an American Town |location=Ithaca |publisher=Cornell UP |year=1986 |pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The questions that Legal Anthropologists seek to answer concern how is [[law]] present in cultures? How does it manifest? How may anthropologists contribute to understandings of law?

Earlier legal anthropological research focused more narrowly on conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation.  [[Bronisław Malinowski]]'s 1926 work, ''Crime and Custom in Savage Society'', explored law, order, crime, and punishment among the [[Trobriand Islanders]].&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, Bronislaw 1985[1926] Crime and Custom in Savage Society. Totowa, New Jersey:  Rowman &amp; Allanheld.&lt;/ref&gt;  The English lawyer Sir [[Henry Maine]] is often credited with founding the study of Legal Anthropology through his book ''[[Ancient Law]]'' (1861), and although his evolutionary stance has been widely discredited within the discipline, his questions raised have shaped the subsequent discourse of the study. This ethno-centric evolutionary perspective was pre-eminent in early Anthropological discourse on law, evident through terms applied such as ‘pre-law’ or ‘proto-law’ and applied by so-called armchair anthropologists. However, a turning point was presented in the 1926 publication of ''Crime and Custom in Savage Society'' by [[Bronisław Malinowski|Malinowski]] based upon his time with the Trobriand Islanders. Through emphasizing the order present in acephelous societies, Malinowski proposed the cross-cultural examining of law through its established functions as opposed to a discrete entity. This has led to multiple researchers and ethnographies examining such aspects as order, dispute, conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation, in addition (and often antagonistically) to law-centred studies, with small-societal studies leading to insightful self-reflections and better understanding of the founding concept of law.

Legal anthropology remains a lively discipline with modern and recent applications including issues such as [[human rights]], [[legal pluralism]], [[Islamophobia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowen |first=John R. |title=A New Anthropology of Islam |year=2012 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Political theologies: public religions in a post-secular world |year=2006 |publisher=Fordham University Press |location=New York |editor=Hent de Vries and Lawrence E. Sullivan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and political uprisings.

==What is law?==
{{see also|Philosophy of law}}
Legal Anthropology provides a definition of law which differs from that found within modern legal systems. Hoebel (1954) offered the following definition of law: ''“A social norm is legal if its neglect or infraction is regularly met, in threat or in fact, by the application of physical force by an individual or group possessing the socially recognized privilege of so acting”''

Maine argued that human societies passing through three basic stages of legal development, from a group presided over by a senior agnate, through stages of territorial development and culminating in an elite forming normative laws of society, stating that ''“what the juristical oligarchy now claims is to monopolize the knowledge of the laws, to have the exclusive possession of the principles by which quarrels are decided”''

This [[evolutionary approach]], as has been stated, was subsequently replaced within the anthropological discourse by the need to examine the manifestations of law’s societal function. As according to [[Hoebel]], law has four functions:

1)	to identify socially acceptable lines of behaviour for inclusion in the culture. 
2)	To allocate authority and who may legitimately apply force.
3)	To settle trouble cases.
4)	To redefine relationships as the concepts of life change.

Legal theorist H. L. A. Hart, however, stated that law is a body of rules, and is a union of two sets of rules: 
# rules on conduct ("primary rules") &lt;ref&gt;H. L. A. Hart, "Law as the Union of Primary and Secondary Rules," The Concept of Law.&lt;/ref&gt;
# rules about recognizing, changing, applying, and adjudicating on rules on conduct ("secondary rules") &lt;ref&gt;H. L. A. Hart, "Law as the Union of Primary and Secondary Rules," The Concept of Law.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within modern English Theory, law is a discrete and specialized topic. Predominantly positivist in character, it is closely linked to notions of a rule-making body, the judiciary and enforcement agencies. The centralized state organisation and isolates are essentials to the attributes of rules, courts and sanctions. To learn more on this view, see Hobbes. 1651 Leviathan, part 2, chapter 26  or Salmond, J. 1902 Jurisprudence.

However, this view of law is not applicable everywhere. There are many acephelous societies around the world where the above control mechanisms are absent. There are no conceptualized and isolated set of normative rules – these are instead embodied in everyday life. Even when there may be a discrete set of legal norms, these are not treated similarly to the English Legal System’s unequivocal power and unchallenged pre-eminence. Shamans, fighting and supernatural means are all mechanisms of superimposing rules within other societies. For example, within [[Rasmussen]]’s work of Across Arctic America (1927) he recounts [[Eskimo]] nith-songs being used as a public reprimand by expressing the wrongdoing of someone guilty.

Thus, instead of focusing upon the explicit manifestations of law, legal anthropologists have taken to examining the functions of law and how it is expressed. A view expressed by Leopold Pospisil&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pospisil, Leopold |title=The Anthropology of Laws: A Comparative Theory  |year=1974|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; and encapsulated by Bronislaw Malinowski:

''“In such primitive communities I personally believe that law ought to be defined by function and not by form, that is we ought to see what are the arrangements, the sociological realities, the cultural mechanisms which act for the enforcement of law”''&lt;ref&gt;(1934: Introduction to Hogbin, Law and Order in Polynesia).&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, law has been studied in ways that may be categorized by as:

1) prescriptive rules
2) observable regularities
3) Instances of dispute.

==Processual paradigm: order and conflict==

Order and regulatory behaviour are required if social life is to be maintained. The scale and shade of this behaviour depends on the values and beliefs held by a society deriving from implicit understandings of the norm developed through socialization. There are socially constructed norms with varying degrees of explicitness and levels of order. Conflict may not be interpreted as an extreme pathological event but as a regulatory acting force.

This processual understanding of conflict and dispute became apparent and subsequently heavily theorized upon by the anthropological discipline within the latter half of the nineteenth century as a gateway to the law and order of a society. Disputes have become to be recognised as necessary and constructive over pathological whilst the stated rules of law only explain some aspects of control and compliance. The context and interactions of a dispute are more informative about a culture than the rules.

Classic studies deriving theories of order from disputes include Evans-Pritchard work Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic among the Azande which focused upon functional disputes surrounding sorcery and witchcraft practices, or Comaroff and Roberts (1981) work among the Tswana which examine the hierarchy of disputes, the patterns of contact and the effect norms affect the course of dispute as norms important to dispute are rarely ''“especially organised for jural purpose”'' &lt;ref&gt;(Bohannan, 1957:58).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include:

[[Edmund Leach|Leach]], 1954. Political Systems of Highland Burma.
[[Fredrik Barth|Barth]], 1959. Political Leadership among Swat Pathans.

==Case study approach==

Within the history of Legal Anthropology there have been various methods of data gathering adopted; ranging from literature review of traveller/missionary accounts, consulting informants and lengthy participant observation.

Furthermore, when evaluating any research it is appropriate to have a robust methodology capable of scientifically analysing the topic at hand.

The broad method of study by legal anthropologists prevails upon the Case Study Approach first developed by Llewellyn and Hoebel in The Cheyenne Way (1941) not as ''“a philosophy but a technology”'' &lt;ref&gt;(Pospisil, 1973: 541).&lt;/ref&gt;

This methodology is applied to situations of cross-cultural conflict and the correlating resolution, which can have sets of legal notions and jural regularities extracted from them &lt;ref&gt;(Bohannan, 1965: pp. 41; Pospisil, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

This method may be safe-guarded against accusations of imposing western ideological structures as it is often an emic sentiment: for example,

''“The Tiv drove me to the case method…what they were interested in. They put a lot of time and effort into cases”''
&lt;ref&gt;(Bohannan, 1989: vii).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues of terminology and ethnology==

Regarding law, in Anthropology’s characteristically self-conscious manner, the comparative analysis inherent to Legal Anthropology has been speculated upon and most famously debated by [[Paul Bohannan]] and [[Max Gluckman]]. The discourse highlights one of the primary differences between British and American Anthropology regarding fieldwork approaches and concerns the imposition of Western terminology as ethnological categories of differing societies.&lt;ref&gt;(Bohannan, 1956).&lt;/ref&gt;

Each author’s uses the Case Study Approach, however, the data’s presentation in terms of achieving comparativeness is a point of contention between them.

Paul Bohannan promotes the use of native terminology presented with ethnographic meaning as opposed to any Universal categories, which act as barriers to understanding the true nature of a culture’s legal system.

Advocating that it is better to appreciate native terms in their own medium, Bohannan critiques Gluckman’s work for its inherent [[bias]].

Gluckman has argued that Bohannan’s excessive use of native terminology creates barriers when attempting to achieve comparative analysis. He in turn has suggested that in order to further the cross-cultural comparative study of law, we should use English terms and concepts of law which will aid in the refinement of dispute facts and interrelations &lt;ref&gt;(Gluckman, 1965: 26).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, all native terms should be described and translated into an Anglo-American conceptual equivalent for the purpose of comparison.

==Processes==

As disputes and order began to be recognised as categories worthy of study, interest in the inherent aspects of conflicts emerged within legal anthropology. The processes and actors involved within the events became an object of study for ethnographers as they embraced conflict as a data-rich source.

One example of such an interest is expressed by [[Philip Gulliver]], 1963, Social Control in an African Society in which the intimate relations between disputes are postulated as being important. He examines the patterns of alliance between actors of a dispute and the strategies that develop as a result, the roles of mediators and the typologies for intervention.

==Key questions in legal anthropology==

*'''Issues of Legal Pluralism'''.
See ''[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15129292 Lyon, 2002] Local arbitration and conflict deferment in Punjab, Pakistan'' or ''Engel, D. 1980. Legal pluralism in an American community: perspectives on a civil trial court.''

*'''The legitimacy of Universal Human Rights'''.
Political anthropologists have had much to say about the UDHR(Universal Declaration of Human Rights). Original critiques, most notably by the AAA(American Anthropological Association), argued that cultural ideas of rights and entitlement differ between societies. They warned that any attempt to endorse one set of values above all others amounted to a new western imperialism, and would be counter to ideas of cultural relativism. Most anthropologists now agree that universal human rights have a useful place in today's world. Zechenter (1997) argues there are practices, such as Indian 'sati' (the burning of a widow on her husband's funeral pyre) that can be said to be wrong, despite justifications of tradition. This is because such practices are about much more than a culturally established world view, and frequently develop or revive as a result of socio-economic conditions and the balance of power within a community. As culture is not bounded and unchanging, there are multiple discourses and moral viewpoints within any community and among the various actors in such events (Merry 2003). Cultural relativists risk supporting the most powerfully asserted position at the expense of those who are subjugated under it.

More recent contributions to the question of universal human rights include analysis of their use in practice, and how global discourses are translated into local contexts (Merry 2003). Anthropologists such as Merry (2006) note how the legal framework of the UNDHR is not static but is actively used by communities around the globe to construct meaning. As much as the document is a product of western Enlightenment thinking, communities have the capacity to shape its meaning to suit their own agendas, incorporating its principles in ways that empower them to tackle their own local and national discontents.

Female genital cutting (FGC), also known as female circumcision or female genital mutilation remains a hotly debated, controversial issue contested particularly among legal anthropologists and human rights activists. Through her ethnography (1989) on the practice of pharonic circumcision among the Hofriyat of Sudan (1989) Boddy maintains that understanding local cultural norms is of crucial importance when considering intervention to prevent the practice. Human rights activists attempting to eradicate FGC using the legal framework of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UNDHR) as their justification, run the risk of imposing a set of ideological principles, alien to the culture attempting to be helped, potentially facing hostile reactions. Moreover, the UNDHR as a legal document, is contested by some as being restrictive in its prescription of what is and is not deemed a violation of a human right (Ross 2003) and  overlooks local customary justifications which operate outside of an international legalistic framework (Ross 2003). Increasingly (FGC) is becoming a global issue due to increased mobility. What was once deemed a largely African practice has seen a steady increase in European countries such as Britain. Although made illegal in 1985 there have as yet been no convictions and girls as old as nine continue to have the procedure. Legislation has now also been passed in Sweden, the United States and France where there have been convictions. Black, J. A. and Debelle, G. D. (1995) "Female Genital Mutilation in Britain" ''British Medical Journal''.

==Further information==
There are a number of useful introductions to the field of legal anthropology,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example Moore, Sally Falk, ''Law and Anthropology: A Reader'', (edited), Blackwell, 2004, pp. 20-25, {{ISBN|1-4051-0228-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sally Falk Moore]], a leading legal anthropologist, held both a law degree and a PhD in anthropology. An increasing number of legal anthropologists hold both [[juris doctor|JD]]s and advanced degrees in anthropology, and some teach in [[law school]]s while maintaining scholarly connections within the field of legal anthropology; examples include Rebecca French, John Conley, [[Elizabeth Mertz]], and [[Annelise Riles]]. Such combined expertise has also been turned to more [[applied anthropology|applied anthropological]] pursuits such as tribal advocacy and [[forensic anthropology|forensic ethnography]] by practitioners. There is a growing interest in the intersection of legal and [[linguistic anthropology]].

While [[compass surveying]], the magnetic needle is sometimes disturbed from its normal position under the influence of external attractive forces. Such a disturbing influence is called as '''local attraction'''.&lt;ref&gt;surveying volume 1 by Dr B.c Punmia and Ashok Kumar Jain. Chapter Compass Surveying&lt;/ref&gt; The external forces are produced by sources of local attraction which may be current carrying wire (magnetic materials) or [[metal]] objects.&lt;ref&gt;surveying by prof. Sk Duggal available on internet from Google books&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to denote amount of deviation of the needle from its normal position. It mostly causes errors in observations while [[surveying]] and thus suitable methods are employed to neglect these errors.&lt;ref&gt;Surveying by prof. Cl Kocher ,Principal of Mehar chand Polytechnic College, [[Jalandhar]] City, [[Punjab]]/Compass Surveying&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
The sources of local attraction may be natural or artificial. Natural sources include [[Iron ores]] or magnetic rocks while as artificial sources consist of steel structures, iron pipes, current carrying [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductors]]. The [[iron]] made [[surveying]] instruments such as metric chains, ranging rods and arrows should also be kept at a safe distance apart from [[compass]].&lt;ref&gt;surveying by Prof. Aftab Ahmad&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection==
Local attraction at a place can be detected by observing bearings from both ends of the line in the area. If fore bearing and back bearing of a line differ exactly by 180°, there is no local attraction at either station. But if this difference is not equal to 180°, then local attraction exists there either at one or both ends of the line.&lt;ref&gt;surveying by Prof. Cl Kocher&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remedies==
There are two common methods of correcting observed bearings of the lines taken in the area affected by Local Attraction. The first method involves '''correcting the bearing with the help of corrected included angles''' and the second method involves correcting the '''bearing of traverse from one correct bearing''' ( in which difference between fore bearing and back bearing is exactly equal to 180°) by the process of distribution of error to other bearings.&lt;ref&gt;Surveying by Dr. Bc Punmia/Compass Surveying&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4211">'''Manomet, Inc.''' is a non-profit organization headquartered in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]], with an office in [[Brunswick, Maine]].

Manomet scientists work with private industry, nonprofit and governmental partners across North and South America to create a more sustainable world. Manomet works in the areas of conservation, business sustainability and science education.

==History==
Manomet is a non-profit research organization which was founded as the '''Manomet Bird Observatory''' in 1969 and was called '''Manomet Center for Conservation Sciences''' until 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Story|url=http://www.manomet.org/about-us|publisher=Manomet Center for Conservation Science|accessdate=14 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628031617/http://www.manomet.org/about-manomet/our-story|archivedate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Manomet is named for the coastal village in New England where its headquarters have been for more than 45 years. A Native American word, the name Manomet means portage path.

Manomet focuses its programs where they will have measurable impact and opportunity for scale: 
*Climate Services — Integrating science and stakeholder networks to identify and implement nature–based solutions to climate change.
*Landbird Conservation — Using long-term research and education to connect people to nature.
*Shorebird Recovery — Engaging a diverse coalition of people and organizations across the Americas to develop and implement science-based solutions to conserve imperiled shorebirds.
*Sustainable Economies — Advising partners on practices to enhance economic viability and human well-being while measurably reducing their environmental footprint

==Recent Studies==
In June 2010, Manomet published the Biomass Sustainability and Carbon Policy Study. The study, which was commissioned by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources, investigated questions about generating electricity from biomass fuel, including the net effect of biomass energy on atmospheric carbon balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biomass Sustainability and Carbon Policy Study|url=http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eoeeaterminal&amp;L=4&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Energy%2C+Utilities+%26+Clean+Technologies&amp;L2=Renewable+Energy&amp;L3=Biomass&amp;sid=Eoeea&amp;b=terminalcontent&amp;f=doer_arra_bscps&amp;csid=Eoeea|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|accessdate=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded that [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from [[wood fuel|burning wood]] are initially higher than from fossil fuels, but the carbon sequestered by regrowing forests can yield lower greenhouse gas levels over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zeller|first=Tom|title=Q. and A.: Woody Biomass, Pros and Cons|url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/q-and-a-woody-biomass-pros-and-cons/|accessdate=August 1, 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=June 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics''' is a [[Max Planck Institute]], located in [[Garching bei München|Garching]], near [[Munich]], [[Germany]].
In 1991 the '''Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics''' split up into the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, the [[Max Planck Institute for Physics]] and the [[Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics]]. The Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics was founded as sub-institute in 1963. The
scientific activities of the institute are mostly devoted to astrophysics with telescopes orbiting in space. A large amount of the resources
are spent for studying black holes in the galaxy and in the remote universe.

== History ==

The Max-Planck-Institute for extraterrestrial physics (MPE) was preceded by the department for extraterrestrial physics in the Max-Planck-Institute for physics and astrophysics. This department was established by Professor Reimar Lüst on October 23, 1961. A Max-Planck Senate resolution transformed this department into a sub-institute of the Max-Planck-Institute for Physics and Astrophysics on May 15, 1963. Professor Lüst was appointed director of the Institute. Another Senate resolution on March 8, 1991 finally established MPE as an autonomous institute within the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft. It is dedicated to the experimental and theoretical exploration of the space outside of earth as well as astrophysical phenomena.&lt;ref name="MPE: History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the MPE|url=http://www.mpe.mpg.de/history.html#2|accessdate=13 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916070822/http://www.mpe.mpg.de/history.html#2|archivedate=16 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Detailed history ===
The Max-Planck-Institut für extraterrestrische Physik (MPE) was preceded by the department for extraterrestrial Physics in the Max-Planck-Institut für Physik und Astrophysik. This department was established by Professor Reimar Lüst on October 23, 1961. A Max-Planck Senate resolution transformed this department into a sub-institute of the Max-Planck-Institut für Physik und Astrophysik on May 15, 1963. Professor Lüst was appointed Director of the Institute. Another Senate resolution on March 8, 1991 finally established MPE as an autonomous institute within the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft. It is dedicated to the experimental and theoretical exploration of the space outside of earth as well as astrophysical phenomena. A continuous reorientation to new, promising fields of research and the appointment of new members ensures steady advancement.

Among the 29 employees of the Institute when it was founded in 1963 were 9 scientists and 1 Ph.D. student. Twelve years later in 1975 the number of employees had grown to 180 with 55 scientists and 13 Ph.D. students, and today (status 2015) there are some 400 staff (130 scientists and 75 PhD students). It is noteworthy that permanent positions at the institute have not increased since 1973 - despite its celebrated scientific achievements. The increasingly complex tasks and international obligations have been mainly maintained by staff members with positions having limited duration and funded by external organizations.

Because the Institute has assumed a leading position in astronomy internationally, it has attracted guest scientists throughout the world. The number of long-term guests increased from 12 in 1974 to a maximum of 72 in 2000. In recent years MPE has hosted an average of about 50 guest scientists each year.

During the early years, the scientific work at the Institute concentrated on the investigation of extraterrestrial plasmas and the magnetosphere of the earth. This work was performed with measurements of particles and electromagnetic fields as well as a specially developed ion-cloud technique using sounding rockets.

Another field of research also became important: astrophysical observations of electromagnetic radiation which could not be observed from the surface of the earth because the wavelengths are such that the radiation is absorbed by the earth's atmosphere. These observations and inferences therefrom are the subject matter of infra-red astronomy as well as X-ray- and gamma-ray-astronomy. In addition to more than 100 rockets, an increasing number of high-altitude balloons (up to now more than 50; e.g.  HEXE) have been used to carry experiments to high altitudes.

Since the 1990s, satellites have become the preferred observation platforms because of their favorable observation-time/cost ratio. Nevertheless, high-flying observation airplanes and ground-based telescopes are also used to obtain data, especially for optical and near-infrared observations.

New observation techniques using satellites has necessitated the recording, processing and accessible storage of high data fluxes over long periods of time. This demanding task is performed by a data processing group, which has grown quickly in the last decade. Special data centers were established for the large satellite projects.

Besides the many successes, there have also been disappointments. The malfunctioning of the Ariane carrier rockets on test launches in 1980 and 1996 were particularly bitter setbacks. The satellite  "Firewheel", in which many members of the Institute had invested years of work, was lost on May 23, 1980 because of a burning instability in the first stage of the launch rocket. The same fate was to overtake the four satellites of the CLUSTER-Mission on June 4, 1996 when the first Ariane 5 was launched. This time the disaster was attributed to an error in the rocket's software. The most recent loss was "ABRIXAS", an X-ray satellite built by industry under the leadership of MPE. After few hours in orbit, a malfunction of the power system caused the total loss of the satellite.

Over the years, however, the history of MPE is primarily a story of scientific successes.&lt;!-- http://www.mpe.mpg.de/576082/overview

== Scientific work ==
[[File:MICADO agreement signed.jpg|thumb|Agreement Signed for [[MICADO]] Camera for [[E-ELT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agreement Signed for MICADO Camera for E-ELT|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann15068/|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The institute was founded in 1963 as a sub-institute of the Max-Planck-Institut für Physik und Astrophysik and established as an independent institute in 1991.
Its main research topics are astronomical observations in spectral regions which are only accessible from space because of the absorbing effects of the Earth's atmosphere, but also instruments on ground-based observatories are used whenever possible.
Scientific work is done in four major research areas that are supervised by one of the directors, respectively: optical and interpretative astronomy (Bender), infrared and sub-millimeter/millimeter astronomy (Genzel), high-energy astrophysics (Nandra), and in the Centre for Astrochemical Studies (Caselli). Within these areas scientists lead individual experiments and research projects organised in about 25 project teams. The research topics pursued at MPE range from the physics of cosmic plasmas and of stars to the physics and chemistry of interstellar matter, from star formation and nucleosynthesis to extragalactic astrophysics and cosmology.

Many experiments of the Max-Planck-Institut für extraterrestrische Physik (MPE) have to be carried out above the dense Earth's atmosphere using aircraft, rockets, satellites and space probes. In the early days experiments were also flown on balloons. To run advanced extraterrestrial physics and state-of-the-art experimental astrophysics, the institute continues to develop high-tech instrumentation in-house. This includes detectors, spectrometers, and cameras as well as telescopes and complete payloads (e.g. [[ROSAT]] and [[eROSITA]]) and even entire satellites (as in case of AMPTE and EQUATOR-S). For this purpose the technical and engineering departments are of particular importance for the institute's research work.

Observers and experimenters perform their research work at the institute in close contact with each other. Their interaction while interpreting observations and propounding new hypotheses underlies the successful progress of the institute's research projects.

At the end of the year 2009 a total of 487 employees were working at the institute, numbering among them 75 scientist, 95 junior scientists (45 IMPRS PhD students included), 97 externally funded positions and 64 visiting scientists and interns.

The MPE is also active in scientific and vocational training. At the end of 2009 6 students were working on their diploma thesis and 9 apprentices worked in the administration (1) and the institute's workshop (8).&lt;ref name="MPE: Sc.Work"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific Work at the MPE|url=http://www.mpe.mpg.de/profile.html#8|accessdate=13 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618214732/http://www.mpe.mpg.de/profile.html#8|archivedate=18 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==

Scientific projects at the MPE are often the efforts of the different research departments to build, maintain, and use experiments and facilities which are needed by the many different scientific research interest at the institute. Apart from hardware projects, there are also projects that use archival data and are not necessarily connected to a new instrument.

The '''Maxims of Islamic Law''' were established after representatives of all schools of thought regarding Muslim Jurisprudence came together to reach a consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Abd-Allah, Umar Faruq. "Islam and the cultural imperative." CrossCurrents (2006): 357-375. [http://www.nawawi.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Article3.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}
Maxims refer to a body of abstract rules that were produced after a detailed study of the fiqh. They’re theoretical guidelines corresponding to different areas of [[fiqh]], which may be dealing with anything from evidence to [[matrimonial law]].&lt;ref&gt;Kamali, Mohammad Hashim. Principles of Islamic jurisprudence. The Islamic Text Society, 1991., https://d1.islamhouse.com/data/en/ih_books/single2/en_Principles_of_Islamic_Jurisprudence.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[fiqh]] is Islamic jurisprudence,through the human interpretation of [[Islamic law]].

==The five Normative Maxims of Islamic law are==
* Al-umuru bi-maqasidiha: Acts are judged by the intention behind them
* Ad-dararu yuzal: Harm must be eliminated 
* Al-yaqinu la yazulu bish-shakk: Certainty is not overruled by doubt
* Al-'addatu muhakkamatun: Custom is the basis of judgement
* Al-mashaqqatu tujlab at-taysir: Hardship begets facility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Godlas|first1=Alan|title=The five Universal Maxims of Islamic Law|url=http://islam.uga.edu/law_maxims.html|website=Islamic Studies- University of Georgia|accessdate=16 November 2016|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mechanism''' is the belief that natural wholes (principally living things) are like complicated machines or artifacts, composed of parts lacking any intrinsic relationship to each other. Thus, the source of an apparent thing's activities is not the whole itself, but its parts or an external influence on the parts.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The doctrine of mechanism in [[philosophy]] comes in two different flavors. They are both doctrines of [[metaphysics]], but they are different in scope and ambitions: the first is a global doctrine about nature; the second is a local doctrine about humans and their minds, which is hotly contested. For clarity, we might distinguish these two doctrines as [[universal mechanism]] and [[anthropic mechanism]].

{{quote|There is no constant meaning in the history of philosophy for the word Mechanism. Originally, the term meant that cosmological theory which ascribes the motion and changes of the world to some external force. In this view material things are purely passive, while according to the opposite theory (i. e., Dynamism), they possess certain internal sources of energy which account for the activity of each and for its influence on the course of events; These meanings, however, soon underwent modification. The question as to whether motion is an inherent property of bodies, or has been communicated to them by some external agency, was very often ignored. With a large number of cosmologists the essential feature of Mechanism is the attempt to reduce all the qualities and activities of bodies to quantitative realities, i. e. to mass and motion. But a further modification soon followed. Living bodies, as is well known, present at first sight certain characteristic properties which have no counterpart in lifeless matter. Mechanism aims to go beyond these appearances. It seeks to explain all "vital" phenomena as physical and chemical facts; whether or not these facts are in turn reducible to mass and motion becomes a secondary question, although Mechanists are generally inclined to favour such reduction. The theory opposed to this biological mechanism is no longer Dynamism, but Vitalism or Neo-vitalism, which maintains that vital activities cannot be explained, and never will be explained, by the laws which govern lifeless matter.&lt;ref name="CE1913"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Mechanism |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |date=1913 |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Mechanism}}&lt;/ref&gt;|"Mechanism" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1913)}}

== Universal mechanism&lt;!--'Universal mechanism' redirects here--&gt; ==

The older doctrine, here called '''universal mechanism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, is the ancient philosophies closely linked with [[materialism]] and [[reductionism]], especially that of the [[atomism|atomists]] and to a large extent, [[stoicism|stoic physics]]. They held that the universe is reducible to completely mechanical principles—that is, the [[motion (physics)|motion]] and collision of [[matter]]. Later mechanists believed the achievements of the [[scientific revolution]] had shown that all phenomena could eventually be explained in terms of 'mechanical' laws, natural laws governing the motion and collision of matter that implied a thorough going [[determinism]]: if ''all'' phenomena could be explained ''entirely'' through the motion of matter under the laws of [[classical physics]], then even more surely than the gears of a clock determine that it must strike 2:00 an hour after striking 1:00, ''all'' phenomena must be completely determined: whether past, present or future. (One of the philosophical implications of modern [[quantum mechanics]] is that this view of determinism is not defensible.)

The French mechanist and determinist [[Pierre Simon de Laplace]] formulated the sweeping implications of this thesis by saying:

{{quote|We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of the past and the cause of the future. An intellect which at any given moment knew all of the forces that animate nature and the mutual positions of the beings that compose it, if this intellect were vast enough to submit the data to analysis, could condense into a single formula the movement of the greatest bodies of the universe and that of the lightest [[atom]]; for such an intellect nothing could be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.|Pierre Simon Laplace|''A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities''}}

One of the first and most famous expositions of universal mechanism is found in the opening passages of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' by [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1651). What is less frequently appreciated is that [[René Descartes]] was a staunch mechanist, though today, in the [[philosophy of mind]], he is remembered for introducing the [[mind–body problem]] in terms of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] and [[physicalism]].

Descartes was a [[substance dualist]], and argued that reality was composed of two radically different types of substance: extended [[matter]], on the one hand, and immaterial [[mind]], on the other. Descartes argued that one cannot explain the conscious mind in terms of the spatial dynamics of mechanistic bits of matter cannoning off each other. Nevertheless, his understanding of biology was thoroughly mechanistic in nature:

:"I should like you to consider that these functions (including passion, memory, and imagination) follow from the mere arrangement of the machine’s organs every bit as naturally as the movements of a clock or other automaton follow from the arrangement of its counter-weights and wheels." (Descartes, Treatise on Man, p.108)

His scientific work was based on the traditional mechanistic understanding that animals and humans are completely mechanistic [[automaton|automata]]. Descartes' dualism was motivated by the seeming impossibility that mechanical dynamics could yield mental experiences.

[[Isaac Newton]] ushered in a much weaker acceptation of mechanism that tolerated the antithetical, and as yet inexplicable, [[action at a distance]] of [[gravity]]. However, his work seemed to successfully predict the motion of both celestial and terrestrial bodies according to that principle, and the generation of philosophers who were inspired by Newton's example carried the mechanist banner nonetheless. Chief among them were French [[philosophy|philosophers]] such as [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]] and [[Denis Diderot]] (see also: [[French materialism]]).

== Anthropic mechanism&lt;!--'Anthropic mechanism' redirects here--&gt; ==

The thesis in '''anthropic mechanism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is not that everything can be completely explained in mechanical terms (although some anthropic mechanists may ''also'' believe that), but rather that everything ''about human beings'' can be completely explained in mechanical terms, as surely as can everything about clocks or the internal combustion engine.

One of the chief obstacles that all mechanistic theories have faced is providing a mechanistic explanation of the human [[mind]]; Descartes, for one, endorsed [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] in spite of endorsing a completely mechanistic conception of the material world because he argued that mechanism and the notion of a mind were logically incompatible. Hobbes, on the other hand, conceived of the mind and the will as purely mechanistic, completely explicable in terms of the effects of perception and the pursuit of desire, which in turn he held to be completely explicable in terms of the materialistic operations of the nervous system. Following Hobbes, other mechanists argued for a thoroughly mechanistic explanation of the mind, with one of the most influential and controversial expositions of the doctrine being offered by [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]] in his ''Man a Machine'' (1748).

Today, as in the past, the main points of debate between anthropic mechanists and anti-mechanists are mainly occupied with two topics: the mind — and consciousness, in particular — and [[free will]]. Anti-mechanists argue that anthropic mechanism is incompatible with our commonsense intuitions: in [[philosophy of mind]] they argue that unconscious matter cannot completely explain the phenomenon of consciousness, and in [[metaphysics]] they argue that anthropic mechanism implies determinism about human action, which (they argue) is incompatible with our understanding of ourselves as creatures with [[free will]]. Contemporary philosophers who have argued for this position include [[Norman Malcolm]] and
[[David Chalmers]].

Anthropic mechanists typically respond in one of two ways. In the first, they agree with anti-mechanists that mechanism conflicts with some of our commonsense intuitions, but go on to argue that our commonsense intuitions are simply mistaken and need to be revised. Down this path lies [[eliminative materialism]] in [[philosophy of mind]], and [[hard determinism]] on the question of free will. This option is accepted by the eliminative materialist philosopher [[Paul Churchland]]. Some have questioned how eliminative materialism is compatible with the freedom of will apparently required for anyone (including its adherents) to make truth claims.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Jonas, ''The Phenomenon of Life: Toward a Philosophical Biology'' (Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press, 2001/1966), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; The second option, common amongst philosophers who adopt anthropic mechanism, is to argue that the [[argument]]s given for incompatibility are specious: whatever it is we mean by "consciousness" and "free will," they urge, it is fully compatible with a mechanistic understanding of the human mind and will. As a result, they tend to argue for one or another non-eliminativist [[Physicalism|physicalist]] theories of mind, and for [[compatibilism]] on the question of free will. Contemporary philosophers who have argued for this sort of account include [[J. J. C. Smart]] and [[Daniel Dennett]].

===Gödelian arguments&lt;!--'Gödelian argument' and 'Gödelian arguments' redirect here--&gt;===
Some scholars have debated over what, if anything, [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] imply about anthropic mechanism. Much of the debate centers on whether the human mind is equivalent to a [[Turing machine]], or by the [[Church-Turing thesis]], any finite machine at all. If it is, and if the machine is [[Consistency|consistent]], then Gödel's incompleteness theorems would apply to it.

'''Gödelian arguments'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; claim that a system of human mathematicians (or some idealization of human mathematicians) is both consistent and powerful enough to recognize its own consistency. Since this is impossible for a Turing machine, the Gödelian concludes that human reasoning must be non-mechanical.

However, the modern consensus in the scientific and mathematical community is that actual human reasoning is inconsistent; that any consistent "idealized version" ''H'' of human reasoning would logically be forced to adopt a healthy but counter-intuitive open-minded skepticism about the consistency of ''H'' (otherwise ''H'' is provably inconsistent); and that Gödel's theorems do not lead to any valid argument against mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Graham Oppy]]|title=Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/#GdeArgAgaMec|website=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|accessdate=27 April 2016|date=20 January 2015|quote=These Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are, however, problematic, and there is wide consensus that they fail.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Stuart J. Russell]]|author2=[[Peter Norvig]]|title=[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]|date=2010|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=0-13-604259-7|edition=3rd|chapter=26.1.2: Philosophical Foundations/Weak AI: Can Machines Act Intelligently?/The mathematical objection|quote=...even if we grant that computers have limitations on what they can prove, there is no evidence that humans are immune from those limitations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Colyvan. An introduction to the philosophy of mathematics. [[Cambridge University Press]], 2012. From 2.2.2, 'Philosophical significance of Gödel's incompleteness results': "The accepted wisdom (with which I concur) is that the Lucas-Penrose arguments fail."&lt;/ref&gt; This consensus that Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are doomed to failure is laid out strongly in ''[[Artificial Intelligence (journal)|Artificial Intelligence]]'': "''any'' attempt to utilize (Gödel's incompleteness results) to attack the [[computationalism|computationalist]] thesis is bound to be illegitimate, since these results are quite consistent with the computationalist thesis."&lt;ref name=laforte&gt;LaForte, G., Hayes, P. J., Ford, K. M. 1998. Why Gödel's theorem cannot refute computationalism. [[Artificial Intelligence (journal)|Artificial Intelligence]], 104:265-286, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
One of the earliest attempts to use incompleteness to reason about human intelligence was by Gödel himself in his 1951 [[Josiah Willard Gibbs Lectureship|Gibbs Lecture]] entitled "Some basic theorems on the foundations of mathematics and their philosophical implications".&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Gödel|Gödel, Kurt]], 1951, ''Some basic theorems on the foundations of mathematics and their implications'' in  [[Solomon Feferman]], ed., 1995. ''Collected works / Kurt Gödel, Vol. III''. Oxford University Press: 304-23.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this lecture, Gödel uses the incompleteness theorem to arrive at the following disjunction: (a) the human mind is not a consistent finite machine, or (b) there exist [[Diophantine equations]] for which it cannot decide whether solutions exist. Gödel finds (b) implausible, and thus seems to have believed the human mind was not equivalent to a finite machine, i.e., its power exceeded that of any finite machine. He recognized that this was only a conjecture, since one could never disprove (b). Yet he considered the disjunctive conclusion to be a "certain fact".

In subsequent years, more direct anti-mechanist lines of reasoning were apparently floating around the intellectual atmosphere. In 1960, [[Hilary Putnam]] published a paper entitled "Minds and Machines," in which he points out the flaws of a typical anti-mechanist argument.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilary Putnam|Putnam, Hilary]], 1960, ''Minds and Machines'' in [[Sidney Hook]], ed., ''Dimensions of Mind: A Symposium''. New York University Press. Reprinted in Anderson, A. R., ed., 1964. ''Minds and Machines''. Prentice-Hall: 77.&lt;/ref&gt;  Informally, this is the argument that the (alleged) difference between "what can be mechanically proven" and "what can be seen to be true by humans" shows that human intelligence is not mechanical in nature. Or, as Putnam puts it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let T be a Turing machine which "represents" me in the sense that T can prove just the mathematical statements I prove. Then using Gödel's technique I can discover a proposition that T cannot prove, and moreover I can prove this proposition. This refutes the assumption that T "represents" me, hence I am not a Turing machine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Hilary Putnam]] objects that this argument ignores the issue of consistency. Gödel's technique can only be applied to consistent systems. It is conceivable, argues Putnam, that the human mind is inconsistent. If one is to use Gödel's technique to prove the proposition that T cannot prove, one must first prove (the mathematical statement representing) the consistency of T, a daunting and perhaps impossible task. Later Putnam suggested that while Gödel's theorems cannot be applied to humans, since they make mistakes and are therefore inconsistent, it may be applied to the human faculty of science or mathematics in general. If we are to believe that it is consistent, then either we cannot prove its consistency, or it cannot be represented by a Turing machine.&lt;ref&gt;The Gödel Theorem and Human Nature, a talk given by [[Hilary Putnam]] in the Gödel centenary 2006  [http://www.logic.at/goedel2006/abstract.php?putnam]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. R. Lucas]] in ''[[Minds, Machines and Gödel]]'' (1961), and later in his book ''The Freedom of the Will'' (1970), lays out an anti-mechanist argument closely following the one described by Putnam, including reasons for why the human mind can be considered consistent.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lucas (philosopher)|Lucas, J. R.]], 1961, "[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~jrlucas/Godel/mmg.html Minds, Machines, and Gödel.]" ''Philosophy 36'':112-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lucas admits that, by Gödel's second theorem, a human mind cannot formally prove its own consistency, and even says (perhaps facetiously) that women and politicians are inconsistent. Nevertheless, he sets out arguments for why a male non-politician can be considered consistent. These arguments are philosophical in nature and are the subject of much debate; Lucas provides references to responses on his own [http://users.ox.ac.uk/~jrlucas/Godel/referenc.html website].

Another work was done by [[Judson Webb]] in his 1968 paper "Metamathematics and the Philosophy of Mind".&lt;ref&gt;[[Judson Webb|Webb, Judson]], 1968, "Metamathematics and the Philosophy of Mind," ''Philosophy of Science 35'': 156-78.&lt;/ref&gt;  Webb claims that previous attempts have glossed over whether one truly can see that the Gödelian statement ''p'' pertaining to oneself, is true. Using a different formulation of Gödel's theorems, namely, that of [[Raymond Smullyan]] and [[Emil Post]], Webb shows one can derive convincing arguments for oneself of both the truth and falsity of ''p''. He furthermore argues that all arguments about the philosophical implications of Gödel's theorems are really arguments about whether the [[Church-Turing thesis]] is true.

Later, [[Roger Penrose]] entered the fray, providing somewhat novel anti-mechanist arguments in his books, ''[[The Emperor's New Mind]]''  (1989) [ENM] and ''[[Shadows of the Mind]]'' (1994) [SM]. These books have proved highly controversial.  [[Martin Davis]] responded to ENM in his paper [http://www.cs.nyu.edu/cs/faculty/davism/penrose.ps "Is Mathematical Insight Algorithmic?" (ps)], where he argues that Penrose ignores the issue of consistency.  [[Solomon Feferman]] gives a critical examination of SM in his paper [http://math.stanford.edu/~feferman/papers/penrose.pdf "Penrose's Gödelian argument" (pdf)].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The response of the scientific community to Penrose's arguments has been negative, with one group of scholars calling Penrose's repeated attempts to form a persuasive Gödelian argument "a kind of intellectual shell game, in which a precisely defined notion to which a mathematical result applies... is switched for a vaguer notion".&lt;ref name=laforte /&gt;

A Gödel-based anti-mechanism argument can be found in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]'', though Hofstadter is widely viewed as a known skeptic of such arguments:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Looked at this way, Gödel's proof suggests – though by no means does it prove! – that there could be some high-level way of viewing the mind/brain, involving concepts which do not appear on lower levels, and that this level might have explanatory power that does not exist – not even in principle – on lower levels. It would mean that some facts could be explained on the high level quite easily, but not on  lower levels at all. No matter how long and cumbersome a low-level statement were made, it would not explain the phenomena in question.
It is analogous to the fact that, if you make derivation after derivation in [[Peano arithmetic]], no matter how long and cumbersome you make them, you will never come up with one for G – despite the fact that on a higher level, you can see that the [[Gödel sentence]] is true.

What might such high-level concepts be? It has been proposed for eons, by various holistically or "soulistically" inclined scientists and humanists that consciousness is a phenomenon that escapes explanation in terms of brain components; so here is a candidate at least. There is also the ever-puzzling notion of free will. So perhaps these qualities could be "emergent" in the sense of requiring explanations which cannot be furnished by the physiology alone
  (''Gödel, Escher, Bach'', p. 708).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rationology.net/eGodel.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9323">[[File:Las Meninas, by Diego Velázquez, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Las Meninas]]'' by [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], used by [[André Gide|Gide]] to demonstrate the technique of ''mise en abyme'']]
In [[Western art history]], '''''Mise en abyme''''' ({{IPA-fr|miz ɑ̃n‿abim}}; also '''''mise en abîme''''') is a formal technique of placing a copy of an image within itself, often in a way that suggests an infinitely recurring sequence. In film theory and literary theory, it refers to the technique of inserting a story within a story. The term is derived from [[heraldry]] and literally means "placed into [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]]". It was first appropriated for modern criticism by the French author [[André Gide]].

A common sense of the phrase is the visual experience of standing between two [[mirror]]s, seeing as a result an infinite reproduction of one's image.&lt;ref name="Rheinhardt2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rheinhardt|first=Dagmar|title=Youtopia. a Passion for the Dark: Architecture at the Intersection Between Digital Processes and Theatrical Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=38_ZvEwnGtQC&amp;pg=PT42|year=2012|publisher=Freerange Press|isbn=978-0-9808689-1-3|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is the [[Droste effect]], in which a picture appears within itself, in a place where a similar picture would realistically be expected to appear.&lt;ref&gt;Nänny. Max and Fischer, Olga, ''The Motivated Sign: Iconicity in Language and Literature'' p.&amp;nbsp;37, John Benjamins Publishing Company (2001) {{ISBN|90-272-2574-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is named after the 1904 [[Droste]] cocoa package, which depicts a woman holding a tray bearing a Droste cocoa package, which bears a smaller version of her image.&lt;ref&gt;Törnqvist, Egil. ''Ibsen: A Doll's House'', p. 105, Cambridge University Press (1995) {{ISBN|0-521-47866-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heraldry==
[[File:Royal Arms of United Kingdom (1816-1837).svg|thumb|left|Coat of arms of the United Kingdom 1816–37]]
In the terminology of [[heraldry]], the ''abyme'' is the center of a [[coat of arms]]. The term ''mise en abyme'' then meant put in the center. It described a coat of arms that appears as a smaller shield in the center of a larger one (see [[Droste effect]]).

A complex example of ''mise en abyme'' is seen in the [[coat of arms of the United Kingdom]] [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom#After the Acts of Union 1707|for the period 1816–1837]], as used by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]. The [[crown of Charlemagne]] is placed ''en abyme'' within the [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] of [[Hanover]], which in turn is ''en abyme'' within the arms of England, Scotland, and Ireland.

Another example is the two-headed eagle in the modern [[coat of arms of Russia]], which holds a [[sceptre]] topped by a similar eagle holding a similar sceptre.

==Medieval examples==
[[File:Istanbul.Hagia Sophia075.jpg|thumb|300px|Southwestern entrance mosaic of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, depicting both Hagia Sophia itself and Constantinople, both offered to Jesus and the Virgin Mary]]
{{further|Mathematics and art}}

While [[art historian]]s working on the early-modern period adopted this phrase and interpreted it as showing artistic "self awareness", medievalists tended not to use it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Many examples, however, can be found in the pre-modern era, as in a [[mosaic]] from the [[Hagia Sophia]] dated to the year 944. To the left, [[Justinian I]] offers the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] the Hagia Sophia, which contains the mosaic itself. To the right, [[Constantine I]] offers the city of [[Constantinople]] (now known as Istanbul), which itself contains the Hagia Sophia.

More medieval examples can be found in the collection of articles ''Medieval mise-en-abyme: the object depicted within itself'',&lt;ref name='mise'/&gt; in which Stuart Whatling conjectures that the self-references sometimes are used to strengthen the symbolism of gift-giving by documenting the act of giving on the object itself. An example of this self-referential gift-giving appears in the [[Stefaneschi Triptych]] in the [[Vatican Museum]], which features Cardinal [[Giacomo Gaetani Stefaneschi]] as the giver of the altarpiece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/PIN/PIN_Sala02_03.html Giotto di Bondone and assistants: Stefaneschi triptych&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical theory and art history==
In [[Western art history]], ''mise en abyme'' is a formal technique in which an image contains a smaller copy of itself, in a sequence appearing to recur infinitely; "[[recursion|recursive]]" is another term for this. The modern meaning of the phrase originates with the author [[André Gide]] who used it to describe self-reflexive embeddings in various art forms and to describe what he sought in his own work.&lt;ref name='mise'&gt;[http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/researchforum/projects/medievalarttheory/documents/Mise-en-abyme.pdf Medieval ''mise-en-abyme'': the object depicted within itself (collection of papers)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102033517/http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/researchforum/projects/medievalarttheory/documents/Mise-en-abyme.pdf |date=2013-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As examples, Gide cites both paintings such as ''[[Las Meninas]]'' by [[Diego Velázquez]] and literary forms such as [[William Shakespeare]]'s use of the "play within a play" device in ''[[Hamlet]]'', where a theatrical company presents a performance for the characters that illuminates a thematic aspect of the play itself. This use of the phrase ''mise en abyme'' was picked up by scholars and popularized in the 1977 book ''Le récit spéculaire. Essai sur la mise en abyme'' by [[Lucien Dällenbach]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucien Dällenbach, ''Le récit spéculaire. Essai sur la mise en abyme'', Paris, Seuil, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and film==
''Mise en abyme'' occurs within a text when there is a reduplication of images or concepts referring to the textual whole. ''Mise en abyme'' is a play of signifiers within a text, of sub-texts mirroring each other. &lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Mise-en-abime" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 252-253&lt;/ref&gt; This mirroring can attain a level where meaning may become unstable and, in this respect, may be seen as part of the process of [[deconstruction]]. The film-within-a-film, where a film contains a plot about the making of a movie, is an example of ''mise en abyme''. The film being made within the film refers, through its ''[[mise en scène]]'', to the real film being made. The spectator sees film equipment, stars getting ready for the take, crew sorting out the various directorial needs. The narrative of the film within the film may directly reflect the one in the real film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/3265.ctl|Hayward, Susan. ''Cinema Studies Key Concepts''. New York: Routledge, 2006.] Accessed 2009-05-27&lt;/ref&gt; An example is ''[[La Nuit américaine]]'' (1973) by [[François Truffaut]].

In [[film]], the meaning of ''mise en abyme'' is similar to the artistic definition, but also includes the idea of a "dream within a dream". For example, a character awakens from a dream and later discovers that s/he is [[false awakening|still dreaming]]. Activities similar to dreaming, such as unconsciousness and virtual reality, also are described as ''mise en abyme''. This is seen in the film ''[[eXistenZ]]'' where the two protagonists never truly know whether or not they are out of the game. It also becomes a prominent element of [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s ''[[Synecdoche, New York]]'' (2008). A more recent instance can be found in the film ''[[Inception]]'' (2010).  Classic filmic examples include the snow globe in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941) which provides a clue to the film's core mystery, and the discussion of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s written works (particularly "[[The Purloined Letter]]") in the [[Jean-Luc Godard]] film ''[[Band of Outsiders]]'' (1964). 

In [[literary criticism]], ''mise en abyme'' is a type of [[frame story]], in which the core narrative may be used to illuminate some aspect of the framing story. The term is used in deconstruction and deconstructive literary criticism as a paradigm of the [[Intertextuality|intertextual]] nature of language, that is, of the way language never quite reaches the foundation of reality because it refers in a frame-within-a-frame way, to other language, which refers to other language, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ross Chambers |title=Story and Situation: Narrative Seduction and the Power of Fiction |year=1984 |url=http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/story-and-situation}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2017}}

==Background==
[[Matter]] is made up by [[atom]]s (formed by [[proton]]s and other [[subatomic particle]]s). When the environment is right, atoms can join together and form [[molecules]], which give rise to most materials studied in [[materials science]]. But certain environments, such as high temperatures, don't allow atoms to form molecules. Stars have very high temperatures, primarily in their interior, and therefore there are few molecules formed in stars. For this reason, a [[chemist]] (who studies atoms and molecules) would not have much to study in a star, so stars are better explained by [[physicist]]s. However, low abundance of molecules in stars is not equated with no molecules at all.&lt;ref name="smol"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/stellar-molecules |title=Stellar Molecules » American Scientist |doi=10.1511/2013.105.403 |publisher=American Scientist |date= |accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence and research==
Although the [[Sun]] is a star, its [[photosphere]] has a low enough temperature of 6,000 [[kelvin]]s, and therefore molecules can form.  [[Water]] has been found on the Sun, and there is evidence of [[molecular hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in [[white dwarf]] stellar atmospheres.&lt;ref name="smol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="XuJura2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Xu |first1=S. |last2=Jura |first2=M. |last3=Koester |first3=D. |last4=Klein |first4=B. |last5=Zuckerman |first5=B. |title=DISCOVERY OF MOLECULAR HYDROGEN IN WHITE DWARF ATMOSPHERES |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=766 |issue=2 |year=2013 |pages=L18 |issn=2041-8205 |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/766/2/L18|arxiv = 1302.6619 |bibcode = 2013ApJ...766L..18X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooler stars include absorption band spectra that are characteristic of molecules.  Similar absorption bands are found in [[sun spot]]s which are cooler areas on the Sun. Molecules found in the Sun include [[magnesium monohydride|MgH]], [[calcium monohydride|CaH]], [[Iron monohydride|FeH]], [[Chromium monohydride|CrH]], [[NaH]], [[hydroxyl radical|OH]], [[Silicon monohydride|SiH]], [[vanadium monoxide|VO]], and [[titanium monoxide|TiO]]. Others include [[Cyanogen radical|CN]] [[Methylidyne|CH]], [[MgF]], [[Imidogen|NH]], [[dicarbon|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[SrF]], [[zirconium monoxide]], [[yttrium monoxide|YO]], [[Scandium monoxide|ScO]], [[borylene|BH]].&lt;ref name=pam/&gt;

Stars of most types can contain molecules, even the Ap category of [[A class star]]s. Only the hottest O, B and A class stars have no detectable molecules.  Also carbon rich white dwarfs, even though very hot, have spectral lines of  [[dicarbon|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Methylidyne|CH]].&lt;ref name=astroc/&gt;

===Laboratory measurements===
Measurements of simple molecules that may be found in stars are performed in laboratories to determine the wavelengths of the spectra lines. Also it is important to measure the [[dissociation energy]] and oscillator strengths (how strongly the molecule interacts with electromagnetic radiation). These measurements are inserted into formula that can calculate the spectrum under different conditions of pressure and temperature. However man-made conditions are often different to stars, because it is hard to achieve the temperatures, and also [[local thermal equilibrium]], as found in stars, is unlikely. Accuracy of oscillator strengths and actual measurement of dissociation energy is usually only approximate.&lt;ref name=astroc/&gt;

===Model atmosphere===
A numerical model of a star's atmosphere will calculate pressures and temperatures at different depths, and can predict the spectrum for different elemental concentrations.

==Application==
The molecules in stars can be used to determine some characteristics of the star. The isotopic composition can be determined if the lines in the molecular spectrum are observed. The different masses of different isotopes cause vibration and rotation frequencies to significantly vary. Secondly the temperature can be determined, as the temperature will change the numbers of molecules in the different vibrational and rotational states. Some molecules are sensitive to the ratio of elements, and so indicate elemental composition of the star.&lt;ref name=astroc&gt;{{cite book |last1=Symposium |first1=International Astronomical Union |last2=Union |first2=International Astronomical |title=Astrochemistry |date=1987 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=9789027723604 |page=852 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nLFYEZyEVQgC&amp;pg=PA583 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different molecules are characteristic of different kinds of stars, and are used to classify them.&lt;ref name=pam&gt;{{cite journal |url=|bibcode=1951ASPL....6..114M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because there can be numerous spectral lines of different strength, conditions at different depths in the star can be determined. These conditions include temperature and speed towards or away from the observer.&lt;ref name=astroc/&gt; 

The spectrum of molecules has advantages over atomic spectral lines, as atomic lines are often very strong, and therefore only come from high in the atmosphere. Also the profile of the atomic spectral line can be distorted due to isotopes or overlaying of other spectral lines.&lt;ref name=astroc/&gt; The molecular spectrum is much more sensitive to temperature than atomic lines.&lt;ref name=astroc/&gt;

China's '''one-child policy''' was part of a birth planning program designed to control the size of its population. Distinct from the family planning policies of most other countries (which focus on providing contraceptive options to help women have the number of children they want), it set a limit on the number of children parents could have, the world's most extreme example of [[Human population planning|population planning]]. It was introduced in 1979 (after a decade-long two-child policy)&lt;ref name="Scharping" /&gt;, modified in the mid 1980s to allow rural parents a second child if the first was a daughter, and then lasted three more decades before being eliminated at the end of 2015. The policy also [[Affirmative action in China|allowed exceptions]] for some other groups, including [[ethnic minorities in China|ethnic minorities]].  The term '''one-child policy''' is thus a misnomer, because for nearly 30 years of the 36 years that it existed (1979-2015) about half of all parents in China were allowed to have a second child.  Provincial governments could (and did) require the use of contraception, sterilizations and abortions to ensure compliance and imposed enormous fines for violations.  Local and national governments created commissions to raise awareness and carry out registration and inspection work.

According to the Chinese government, 400{{nbsp}}million births were prevented, starting from 1970 a decade before the start of the one child policy. Some scholars have disputed this claim, with [[Martin King Whyte]] and Wang ''et al'' contending that the policy had little effect on population growth or the size of the total population.&lt;ref name= "Wang Judge"&gt;{{cite journal|first1 =Wang|last1 =Feng| last2=Yong | first2 = Cai| first3=Baochang | last3 = Gu |url= http://dragonreport.com/Dragon_Report/Challenges_files/Wang_pp115-129.pdf|title=Population, Policy, and Politics: How Will History Judge China's One-Child Policy?|journal= Population and Development Review |volume= 38 |date= 2012|pages= 115–29 | doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2013.00555.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Whyte&gt;{{cite journal

Effective from January 2016, the birth planning policy became a universal [[two-child policy#China|two-child policy]] that allowed each couple to have two children.

Although the fertility rate began to decline, the Chinese government observed the global debate over a possible [[overpopulation]] catastrophe suggested by organizations such as [[Club of Rome]] and [[Sierra Club]].  It thus began to encourage one-child families in 1978, and then announced in 1979 its intention to advocate for one-child families.  In 1980, the central government organized a meeting in Chengdu to discuss the speed and scope of one-child restrictions.&lt;ref name="Scharping"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Scharping |first1=Thomas |title=Birth control in China 1949–2000: Population policy and demographic development. |date=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

One participant at the Chengdu meeting had read two influential books about population concerns, ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' and ''[[A Blueprint for Survival]]'' while visiting Europe in 1979.

Although a recent and often-repeated interpretation by Greenhalgh claims that [[Song Jian]] was the central architect of the one-child policy and that he "hijacked" the population policymaking process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Greenhalgh |first1=Susan |title=Just One Child:  Science and Policy in Deng's China |date=2008 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |page=Dust Jacket}}&lt;/ref&gt; that claim has been refuted by several leading scholars, including Liang Zhongtang, a leading internal critic of one-child restrictions and an eye-witness at the discussions in Chengdu.&lt;ref name="Hvistendahl2010"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mara |first1=Hvistendahl |title=Has China outgrown the one-child policy? |agency=Science |issue=329 |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the words of Wang et al., "the idea of the one-child policy came from leaders within the Party, not from scientists who offered evidence to support it”&lt;ref name="Wang Judge" /&gt;  Central officials had already decided in 1979 to advocate for one-child restrictions before knowing of Song's work and, upon learning of his work in 1980, already seemed sympathetic to his position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tien |first1=H.Y. |title=China's Strategic Demographic Initiative |date=1991 |publisher=Praeger |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, even if Song's work convinced them to proceed with universal one-child restrictions in 1980, the policy was loosened to a "1.5"-child policy just five years later, and it is that policy which has been misnomered since as the "one-child policy."  Thus, it is misleading to suggest that [[Song Jian]] was either the inventor or architect of the policy that China had in place from 1985-2015.

==History==
The one-child policy was originally designed to be a One-Generation Policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0-la2vliXwC&amp;pg=PA179|title=Only Hope: Coming of Age Under China's One-Child Policy|last=Fong|first=Vanessa L.|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-80475330-2|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was enforced at the [[provinces of the People's Republic of China|provincial level]] and enforcement varied; some provinces had more relaxed restrictions. The one-child limit was most strictly enforced in densely populated urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unescap.org/esid/psis/population/database/chinadata/intro.htm|title=Status of Population and Family Planning Program in China by Province|publisher=[[Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330215041/http://www.unescap.org/esid/psis/population/database/chinadata/intro.htm|archivedate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1980, the official policy granted local officials the flexibility to make exceptions and allow second children in the case of "practical difficulties" (such as cases in which the father is a disabled serviceman) or when both parents are single children,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD81F3BF937A15752C0A961948260 | newspaper=The New York Times | date=4 January 1987 | accessdate=27 October 2008 | title=America, the U.N. and China's Family Planning (Opinion) | last=Scheuer | first=James}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some provinces had other exemptions worked into their policies as well. In most areas, families were allowed to apply to have a second child if their first-born is a daughter.&lt;ref name="mostpeople"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-07/11/content_5432238.htm|title=Most people free to have more child|date=11 July 2007|accessdate=31 July 2009|work=[[China Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huiting2002"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/2002/Oct/46138.htm | title=Family Planning Law and China's Birth Control Situation | newspaper=[[China Daily]] | author=Hu, Huiting | date=18 October 2002 | accessdate=2 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, families with children with [[disability in China|disabilities]] have different policies and families whose first child suffers from [[Disability|physical disability]], [[mental illness]], or [[intellectual disability]] were allowed to have more children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/listseason/11.html | title=China's Only Child | series=NOVA | serieslink=Nova (TV series) | network=PBS | date=14 February 1984 | accessdate=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, second children were sometimes subject to [[birth spacing]] (usually 3 or 4 years).

In accordance with China's [[affirmative action in China|affirmative action]] policies towards [[List of ethnic groups in China|ethnic minorities]], all non-[[Han Chinese|Han]] ethnic groups are subjected to different laws and were usually allowed to have two children in urban areas, and three or four in rural areas.

===Implementation===
The Family Planning Policy was enforced through a financial penalty in the form of the "social child-raising fee", sometimes called a "family planning fine" in the West, which was collected as a fraction of either the annual disposable income of city dwellers or of the annual cash income of peasants, in the year of the child's birth.&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:Image:Sichuan social fostering fee schedule.jpg#file|Summary of Family Planning notice on how FP fines are collected]]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in Guangdong, the fee is between 3 and 6 annual incomes for incomes below the per capita income of the district, plus 1 to 2 times the annual income exceeding the average. Both members of the couple need to pay the fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.china.org.cn/english/government/224913.htm |title=Heavy Fine for Violators of One-Child Policy | place = [[China|CN]] |accessdate= 4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the policy, women were required to have  a contraceptive [[intrauterine device]] (IUD) surgically installed after having a first child, and to be sterilized by [[tubal ligation]] after having a second child. From 1980 to 2014, 324 million Chinese women were fitted with IUDs in this way and 108 million were sterilized. Women who refused these procedures – which many resented – could lose their government employment and their children could lose access to education or health services. The IUDs installed in this way were modified such that they could not be removed manually, but only through surgery. In 2016, following the abolition of the one-child policy, the Chinese government announced that IUD removals would now be paid for by the government.&lt;ref name="The New York Times 7 January 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wee|first1=Sui-lee|title=After One-Child Policy, Outrage at China's Offer to Remove IUDs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/07/world/asia/after-one-child-policy-outrage-at-chinas-offer-to-remove-iuds.html|accessdate=8 January 2017|work=The New York Times|date=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relaxation===
In 2013, Deputy Director Wang Peian of the [[National Health and Family Planning Commission]] said that "China's population will not grow substantially in the short term".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Burkitt | first = Laurie | date = 17 November 2013 | url = https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303755504579203853048322532 | title = China to Move Slowly on One-Child Law Reform | edition = online | newspaper = The Wall Street Journal | accessdate = 5 December 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A survey by the commission found that only about half of eligible couples wish to have two children, mostly because of the cost of living impact of a second child.&lt;ref name=nyt-20140225&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/world/asia/many-couples-in-china-will-pass-on-a-new-chance-for-a-second-child.html |title=Many in China Can Now Have a Second Child, but Say No | first = Dan | last = Levin |newspaper= The New York Times |date=25 February 2014 |accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, following the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, China announced the decision to relax the one-child policy.

And if people don't start having more children, they're going to have a vastly diminished workforce to support a huge aging population."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Fong | first = Mei | author-link = Mei Fong | date = 15 October 2015 | title = China one-child policy | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/10/151030-china-one-child-policy-mei-fong/ | newspaper = National Geographic}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  China's ratio is about five working adults to one retiree; the huge retiree community must be supported, and that will dampen future growth, according to Fong.

Since the citizens of China are living longer and having fewer children, the growth of the population imbalance is expected to continue, as reported by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] which referred to a [[United Nations]] projections forecast that "China will lose 67{{nbsp}}million working-age people by 2030, while simultaneously doubling the number of elderly. That could put immense pressure on the economy and government resources."&lt;ref name= "cbc.ca" /&gt;  The longer term outlook is also pessimistic, based on an estimate by the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]], revealed by Cai Fang, deputy director.  "By 2050, one-third of the country will be aged 60 years or older, and there will be fewer workers supporting each retired person."&lt;ref name= "chinadaily.com.cn"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2014-12/16/content_19093408.htm | title = China daily | date = Dec 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many critics of China's reproductive restrictions approve of the policy's abolition, Amnesty International said that the move to the two-child policy would not end forced sterilizations, forced abortions, or government control over birth permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=China ends one-child policy — but critics warn new two-child policy won't end forced abortions |url= http://www.rawstory.com/2015/10/china-ends-one-child-policy-but-critics-warn-new-two-child-policy-wont-end-forced-abortions/ |publisher= [[The Raw Story]]|accessdate= 29 October 2015|date= 29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/10/china-one-child-reform/|title=China: Reform of one-child policy not enough|website=www.amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others also stated that the abolition is not a sign of the relaxation of authoritarian control in China. A reporter for [[CNN]] said, "It was not a sign that the party will suddenly start respecting personal freedoms more than it has in the past.  No, this is a case of the party adjusting policy to conditions.  ... The new policy, raising the limit to two children per couple, preserves the state's role."&lt;ref name= "cnn.com"&gt;{{Citation | publisher = CNN | last = Ghitis | date = 29 October 2015 | url = http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/29/opinions/ghitis-china-one-child-policy/ | title = China: one-child policy}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20151105-china-one-child-calamity/|title=China’s one-child calamity|date=5 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The abolition may not achieve a significant benefit, as the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] analysis indicated: "Repealing the one-child policy may not spur a huge baby boom, however, in part because fertility rates are believed to be declining even without the policy's enforcement. Previous easings of the one-child policy have spurred fewer births than expected, and many people among China's younger generations see smaller family sizes as ideal."&lt;ref name= "cbc.ca" /&gt; The CNN reporter adds that China's new prosperity is also a factor in the declining&lt;ref name= "chinadaily.com.cn" /&gt; birth rate, saying, "Couples naturally decide to have fewer children as they move from the fields into the cities, become more educated, and when women establish careers outside the home."&lt;ref name="cnn.com" /&gt;

== Administration            ==
The one-child policy was managed by the [[National Population and Family Planning Commission]] under the central government since 1981. The [[Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China]] and the National Health and Family Planning Commission were made defunct and a new single agency [[National Health and Family Planning Commission]] took over national health and family planning policies in 2013. The agency reports to the State Council.

The policy was enforced at the provincial level through fines that were imposed based on the income of the family and other factors. "Population and Family Planning Commissions" existed at every level of government to raise awareness and carry out registration and inspection work.&lt;ref name=dewey&gt;{{cite web | last = Dewey | first = Arthur E | title = One-Child Policy in China | publisher = Senior State Department | date = 16 December 2004 | url = http://statelists.state.gov/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0412c&amp;L=dossdo&amp;P=401 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721062432/http://statelists.state.gov/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0412c&amp;L=dossdo&amp;P=401 | archivedate = 21 July 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Total fertility rate|fertility rate]] in China continued its fall from 2.8 births per woman in 1979 (already a sharp reduction from more than five births per woman in the early 1970s) to 1.5 by the mid 1990s.  Some scholars claim that this decline is similar to that observed in other places that had no one-child restrictions, such as Thailand as well as Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, a claim designed to support the argument that China's fertility might have fallen to such levels anyway without draconian fertility restrictions &lt;ref name= "Wang Judge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sen Cooperation"&gt;{{cite web | last = Sen | first = Amartya | url = http://www.abep.nepo.unicamp.br/docs/PopPobreza/AmartyaSen.pdf | publisher = Universidade de Campinas | title = Population Policy: Authoritarianism versus Cooperation | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | place = [[Brazil|BR]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160623233814/http://www.abep.nepo.unicamp.br/docs/PopPobreza/AmartyaSen.pdf | archivedate = 23 June 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Sen Reality"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yong Development"&gt;{{cite journal |first= Yong |last= Cai |format= [[Portable document format|PDF]] |url= http://courses.arch.vt.edu/courses/wdunaway/gia5524/china10.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150722161857/http://courses.arch.vt.edu/courses/wdunaway/gia5524/china10.pdf |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 22 July 2015 |title= China's Below-Replacement Fertility: Government Policy or Socioeconomic Development? |journal= Population and Development Review |volume= 36 |issue= 3 |date= Sep 2010 |pages= 419–40 |doi= 10.1111/j.1728-4457.2010.00341.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  According to a 2017 study in the [[Journal of Economic Perspectives]], "the one-child policy accelerated the already-occurring drop in fertility for a few years, but in the longer term, economic development played a more fundamental role in leading to and maintaining China's low fertility level."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Junsen|date=1 February 2017|title=The Evolution of China's One-Child Policy and Its Effects on Family Outcomes|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.31.1.141|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|language=en|volume=31|issue=1|pages=141–160|doi=10.1257/jep.31.1.141|issn=0895-3309}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Disparity in sex ratio at birth===
[[File:Sex ratio at birth in mainland China.png|thumb|The [[sex ratio]] at birth in People's Republic of China, males per 100 females, 1980–2010.]] 
{{details |Missing women of China}}
The [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]] of a newborn infant (between male and female births) in [[People's Republic of China|mainland China]] reached 117:100, and stabilized between 2000 and 2013, substantially higher than the natural baseline, which ranges between 103:100 and 107:100. It had risen from 108:100 in 1981—at the boundary of the natural baseline—to 111:100 in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | format = PDF | url=http://www.cicred.org/Eng/Seminars/Details/Seminars/FDA/papers/18_ChenWei.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718153354/http://www.cicred.org/Eng/Seminars/FDA/papers/18_ChenWei.pdf | archivedate=18 July 2006 | last =Wei | first = Chen | title= Sex Ratios at Birth in China | year=2005 | accessdate=2 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report by the [[National Population and Family Planning Commission]], there will be 30{{nbsp}}million more men than women in 2020, potentially leading to social instability, and courtship-motivated [[emigration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Chinese facing shortage of wives | publisher = BBC | date = 12 January 2007| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6254763.stm | accessdate = 12 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disparity in the gender ratio at birth increases dramatically after the first birth, for which the ratios remained steadily within the natural baseline over the 20 year interval between 1980 and 1999. Thus, a large majority of couples appear to accept the outcome of the first pregnancy, whether it is a boy or a girl. If the first child is a girl, and they are able to have a second child, then a couple may take extraordinary steps to assure that the second child is a boy. If a couple already has two or more boys, the sex ratio of higher parity births swings decidedly in a feminine direction. This demographic evidence indicates that while families highly value having male offspring, a secondary norm of having a girl or having some balance in the sexes of children often comes into play. {{Harvnb | Zeng | 1993}} reported a study based on the 1990 census in which they found sex ratios of just 65 or 70 boys per 100 girls for births in families that already had two or more boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Zeng | first = Yi |display-authors=etal | year = 1993 | title = Causes and Implications of the Recent Increase in the Reported Sex Ratio at Birth in China | journal = Population and Development Review | volume = 19 | issue = June | pages = 283–302 | doi=10.2307/2938438}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A study by {{Harvp | Anderson | Silver | 1995}} found a similar pattern among both Han and non-Han nationalities in Xinjiang Province: a strong preference for girls in high [[parity (biology)|parity]] births in families that had already borne two or more boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Barbara A | last1 = Anderson | first2 = Brian D | last2 = Silver | year = 1995 | title = Ethnic Differences in Fertility and Sex Ratios at Birth in China: Evidence from Xinjiang | journal = Population Studies | volume = 49 | issue = July | pages = 211–26 | doi=10.1080/0032472031000148476}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This tendency to favour girls in high parity births to couples who had already borne sons was later also noted by Coale and Banister, who suggested as well that once a couple had achieved its goal for the number of males, it was also much more likely to engage in "stopping behavior", i.e., to stop having more children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Coale | first = Ansley J |authorlink= Ansley J. Coale |first2=Judith |last2=Banister |date=December 1996|title=Five decades of missing females in China|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|volume=140|issue=4|pages=421–450|jstor=987286}} Also printed as {{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2061752|pmid=7828766 | volume=31 | title=Five decades of missing females in China.|date=Aug 1994|journal=Demography|pages=459–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long-term disparity has led to a significant gender imbalance or skewing of the sex ratio. As reported by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], China has between 32{{nbsp}}million and 36{{nbsp}}million more males than would be expected naturally, and this has led to social problems.  "Because of a traditional preference for baby boys over girls, the one-child policy is often cited as the cause of China's skewed sex ratio ... Even the government acknowledges the problem and has expressed concern about the tens of millions of young men who won't be able to find brides and may turn to kidnapping women, sex trafficking, other forms of crime or social unrest."&lt;ref name= "cbc.ca"/&gt; The situation will not improve in the near future. According to the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]], there will be 24 million more men than women of marriageable age by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = Beijing today | date = Oct 2015 | url = https://beijingtoday.com.cn/2015/10/online-dating-a-path-to-marriage-for-young-busy-chinese/ | title = Online dating a path to marriage for young, busy Chinese}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
According to a 2017 study in the [[Journal of Economic Perspectives]], "existing studies indicate either a modest or minimal effect of the fertility change induced by the one-child policy on children education".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Adoption and Abandonment===
[[File:PRC family planning don't abandon girls.jpg|thumb|A roadside sign in rural [[Sichuan]]: "It is forbidden to discriminate against, mistreat or abandon baby girls."]]

For parents who had "unauthorized" births or who wanted a son but had a daughter, giving up the child for adoption was a kind of strategy to avoid penalties under one-child restrictions.  In fact, "out adoption" was not uncommon in China even before birth planning.  In the 1980s, adoptions of daughters accounted for slightly above half of the so-called "missing girls," as out-adopted daughters often went unreported in censuses and survey and adoptive parents were not penalized for violating birth quotas &lt;ref name=johansson1991&gt;{{cite journal | title=The missing girls of China: a new demographic account | last1 =Johansson | first1 = Sten | last2= Nygren | first2=Olga | year=1991 | volume=17 | issue=1 | journal = Population and Development Review | pages= 35–51 | doi= 10.2307/1972351 | publisher= Population Council | jstor=1972351}}&lt;/ref&gt;    However, in 1991, a central decree attempted to close off this loophole by raising penalties and levying those penalties on any household that had an "unauthorized" child, including those that had adopted children.&lt;ref name="JohnsonKA"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=Kay Ann |title=China’s hidden children: Abandonment, adoption, and the human costs of the one- child policy |date=2016 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |url=https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo22977673.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This closing of the adoption loophole resulted in the abandonment of some two million Chinese children (mostly daughters),&lt;ref name="GoodkindBIllion" /&gt; many of who ended up in orphanages, some 120,000 of whom would be adopted by international parents.  

The peak wave of abandonment occurred in the 1990s, with a smaller wave after 2000.&lt;ref name="JohnsonKA" /&gt;  Around the same time, poor care and high mortality rates in some state orphanages generated intense international pressure for reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Death by Default: A Policy of Fatal Neglect in China's State Orphanages |year= 1996| publisher =Human Rights Watch/Asia|location= New York|isbn= 1-56432-163-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/china96.pdf | format = PDF |title=Chinese Orphanages: A Follow-up | publisher = Human Rights Watch/Asia|date=March 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 2005, the number of international adoptions declined, due both to falling birth rates and the related increase in demand for adoptions by Chinese parents themselves.  In an interview with [[National Public Radio]] on 30 October 2015, Adam Pertman,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Adam Pertman | publisher = National center on adoption &amp; permanency | url = http://www.nationalcenteronadoptionandpermanency.net/adam-pertman.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt; president and CEO of the National Center on Adoption and Permanency, indicated that "the infant girls of yesteryear have not been available, if you will, for five, seven years. China has been ... trying to keep the girls within the country ... And the consequence is that, today, rather than those young girls who used to be available – primarily girls – today, it's older children, children with special needs, children in sibling groups. It's very, very different."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = NPR | date = 30 October 2015 | title = How China's one-child policy transformed US attitudes on adoption | url = https://www.npr.org/2015/10/30/453217108/how-chinas-one-child-policy-transformed-u-s-attitudes-on-adoption}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twins===
Since there are no penalties for [[multiple birth]]s, it is believed that an increasing number of couples are turning to fertility medicines to induce the conception of twins. According to a 2006 ''[[China Daily]]'' report, the number of twins born per year was estimated to have doubled.{{clarify timeframe|date=June 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2006-02/14/content_520025.htm | title= China: Drug bid to beat child ban | work=China Daily | accessdate=11 November 2008 | date=14 February 2006 | agency= Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality of life for women===
The one-child policy has played a major role in improving the quality of life for women in China.  For thousands of years, girls have held a lower status in Chinese households. However, the one-child policy's limit on the number of children has prompted parents of women to start investing money in their well-being. As a result of being an only child, women have increased opportunity to receive an education, and support to get better jobs. One of the side effects of the one-child policy is to have liberated women from heavy duties in terms of taking care of many children and the family in the past; instead women had a lot of spare time for themselves to pursue their career or hobbies. The other major "side effect" of the one child policy is that the traditional concepts of gender roles between men and women have weakened. Being one and the only "chance" the parents have, women are expected to compete with peer men for better educational resources or career opportunities. Especially in cities where one-child policy was much more regulated and enforced, expectations on women to succeed in life are no less than on men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10531422/How-Chinas-one-child-policy-overhauled-the-status-and-prospects-of-girls-like-me.html |title=How China's one-child policy overhauled the status and prospects of girls like me |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate= 18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healthcare improvements===
It is reported that the focus of China on population planning helps provide a better health service for women and a reduction in the risks of death and injury associated with pregnancy. At family planning offices, women receive free contraception and pre-natal classes that contributed to the policy's success in two respects. First, the average Chinese household expends fewer resources, both in terms of time and money, on children, which gives many Chinese people more money with which to invest. Second, since Chinese adults can no longer rely on children to care for them in their old age, there is an impetus to save money for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Naughton|first=Barry|title=The Chinese Economy: Transitions and Growth|year=2007|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0262640640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If, for any reason, the single child is unable to care for their older adult relatives, the oldest generations would face a lack of resources and necessities.

J. | title=AQA GCSE Geography A | publisher=Nelson Thornes | location=Cheltenham | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-4085-1708-6 | page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, some people have worried that this will result in a higher tendency toward poor social communication and cooperation skills amongst the new generation, as they have no siblings at home. No social studies have investigated the ratio of these so-called "over-indulged" children and to what extent they are indulged. With the first generation of children born under the policy (which initially became a requirement for most couples with first children born starting in 1979 and extending into the 1980s) reaching adulthood, such worries were reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= The Little Emperors|newspaper= The Los Angeles Times | last =Deane | first = Daniela|date=26 July 1992|page=16|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-26/magazine/tm-5347_1_one-child-policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the "little emperor syndrome" and additional expressions, describing the generation of Chinese singletons are very abundant in the Chinese media, Chinese academia and popular discussions. Being over-indulged, lacking self-discipline and having no adaptive capabilities are traits that are highly associated with Chinese singletons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinkingchinese.com/index.php?page_id=117%20|title= Chinese Singletons&amp;nbsp;– Basic 'Spoiled' Related Vocabulary|work=Thinking Chinese|date=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 30 delegates called on the government in the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] in March 2007 to abolish the one-child rule, citing "social problems and personality disorders in young people". One statement read, "It is not healthy for children to play only with their parents and be spoiled by them: it is not right to limit the number to two children per family, either."&lt;ref name= CPPCC/&gt; The proposal was prepared by Ye Tingfang, a professor at the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]], who suggested that the government at least restore the previous rule that allowed couples to have up to two children. According to a scholar, "The one-child limit is too extreme. It violates nature's law. And in the long run, this will lead to mother nature's revenge."&lt;ref name=CPPCC&gt;{{cite news| title = Consultative Conference: 'The government must end the one-child rule' | publisher = AsiaNews | place = [[Italy|IT]] |date=16 March 2007 | url = http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&amp;art=8757&amp;size=A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Advisors say it's time to change one-child policy | publisher = Shanghai Daily |date=15 March 2007 | url = http://english.sina.com/china/1/2007/0315/106515.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth tourism===
Reports surfaced of Chinese women giving birth to their second child overseas, a practice known as [[birth tourism]]. Many went to Hong Kong, which is exempt from the one-child policy. Likewise, a Hong Kong passport differs from China mainland passport by providing additional advantages. Recently though, the Hong Kong government has drastically reduced the quota of births set for non-local women in public hospitals.  As a result, fees for delivering babies there have surged. As further admission cuts or a total ban on non-local births in Hong Kong are being considered, mainland agencies that arrange for expectant mothers to give birth overseas are predicting a surge in those going to North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.review33.com/m/forum_msg.php?db=3&amp;tstart=0&amp;s=&amp;topic=90120131205753&amp;number=5 |title= 談天說地 |publisher= review33 |accessdate= 4 October 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131004235358/http://www.review33.com/m/forum_msg.php?db=3&amp;tstart=0&amp;s=&amp;topic=90120131205753&amp;number=5 |archivedate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[United States]] practises [[Birthright citizenship in the United States|birthright citizenship]], all children born in the US will automatically have US citizenship. The closest US location from China is [[Saipan]] in the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], a US dependency in the western Pacific Ocean that allows Chinese visitors without visa restrictions. As of 2012, the island was experiencing an upswing in Chinese births, since birth tourism there had become cheaper than to Hong Kong. This option is used by relatively affluent Chinese who often have secondary motives as well, wishing their children to be able to leave mainland China when they grow older or bring their parents to the US. [[Canada]], compared to US, is less achievable as their government denies many visa requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Birth tourism on the upswing | url = http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?cat=1&amp;newsID=116516 | last = Eugenio | first = Haidée V | work = Saipan Tribune | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120516120609/http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?cat=1&amp;newsID=116516 | archivedate = 16 May 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Many Chinese giving birth in CNMI trying to get around one child policy |url=http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?cat=1&amp;newsID=116544 |last=Eugenio |first=Haidée V |work=Saipan Tribune |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209073600/http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?cat=1&amp;newsID=116544 |archivedate=9 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex-selective abortion ===
Due to the preference in Rural Chinese society to give birth to a son,&lt;ref&gt;Hardee, Karen, Gu Baochang, and Xie Zhenming. 2000. "Holding up more than half the sky:Fertility control and women's empowerment in China,"paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Population Association of America, 23–25 March, Los Angeles&lt;/ref&gt; pre-natal sex determination and [[sex-selective abortions]] are illegal in China.&lt;ref&gt;Junhong, Chu, June 2001, "Prenatal Sex Determination and Sex-Selective Abortion in Rural Central China," Population and Development Review, Vol. 27, Iss. 2, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;  Often argued as one of the key factors in the imbalanced sex-ratio in China, as excess female infant mortality and underreporting of female births cannot solely explain this gender disparity.&lt;ref&gt;Hesketh, Therese . Lu, Li. Xing, Zhu Wei, Sept 2005, "The Effect of China's One-Child Family Policy After 25 Years, The New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 353, Iss. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;   Researchers have found that the gender of the firstborn child in rural parts of China impact whether or not the mother will seek an ultrasound for the second child.  40% of women with a firstborn son seek an ultrasound for their second pregnancy, versus 70% of women with firstborn daughters.  This clearly depicts a desire for women to birth a son if one has not yet been birthed.&lt;ref name="Junhong, Chu 2001"&gt;Junhong, Chu (2001). "Prenatal Sex Determination and Sex-Selective Abortion in Rural Central China". ''Population and Development Review''. '''27''' (2): 259–81&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to this, the Chinese government made sex-selective abortions illegal in 2005.&lt;ref name="Junhong, Chu 2001"/&gt;

==Criticism==
The policy is controversial outside China for many reasons, including accusations of human rights abuses in the implementation of the policy, as well as concerns about negative social consequences.&lt;ref name="policy outgrown"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Hvistendahl | first = Mara |title= Has China Outgrown The One-Child Policy? |journal=Science|pages= 1458–61 |volume= 329 |date= 17 September 2010|doi= 10.1126/science.329.5998.1458|pmid= 20847244|issue= 5998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statement of the effect of the policy on birth reduction===
The Chinese government, quoting Zhai Zhenwu, director of Renmin University's School of Sociology and Population in Beijing, estimates that 400{{nbsp}}million births were prevented by the one-child policy as of 2011, while some demographers challenge that number, putting the figure at perhaps half that level, according to CNN.&lt;ref&gt;Some demographers challenge that number, putting the figure at perhaps half that level.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhai clarified that the 400{{nbsp}}million estimate referred not just to the one-child policy, but includes births prevented by predecessor policies implemented one decade before, stating that "there are many different numbers out there but it doesn't change the basic fact that the policy prevented a really large number of births".&lt;ref name=boston.com/&gt;

This claim is disputed by Wang Feng, director of the Brookings-Tsinghua Center for Public Policy, and Cai Yong from the Carolina Population Center at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill&lt;ref name=boston.com/&gt; Wang claims that "Thailand and China have had almost identical fertility trajectories since the mid 1980s", and "Thailand does not have a one-child policy."&lt;ref name=boston.com&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2011/10/27/chinas_touting_of_1_child_rules_draws_challenges/ | title = Experts challenge China's 1-child population claim }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
China's Health Ministry has also disclosed that at least 336{{nbsp}}million abortions were performed on account of the policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9933468/336-million-abortions-under-Chinas-one-child-policy.html|title=336 million abortions under China's one-child policy|date=15 March 2013|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report by the US Embassy, scholarship published by Chinese scholars and their presentations at the October 1997 Beijing conference of the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population seemed to suggest that market-based incentives or increasing voluntariness is not morally better but that it is in the end more effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beijing.usembassy-china.org.cn/report0698family.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218215046/http://beijing.usembassy-china.org.cn/report0698family.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=18 February 2013|publisher=U.S. Embassy in Beijing|date=June 1988|title=PRC Family Planning: The Market Weakens Controls But Encourages Voluntary Limits}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, Zeng Yi and Professor T. Paul Schultz of [[Yale University]] discussed the effect of the transformation to the market on Chinese fertility, arguing that the introduction of the [[Household-responsibility system|contract responsibility system]] in agriculture during the early 1980s weakened family planning controls during that period.&lt;ref&gt;PRC journal ''Social Sciences in China'' [Zhongguo, January 1988]{{full citation needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeng contended that the "big cooking pot" system of the [[People's commune|People's Commune]]s had [[Moral hazard|insulated people from the costs]] of having many children. By the late 1980s, economic costs and incentives created by the contract system were already reducing the number of children farmers wanted.

A long-term experiment in a county in Shanxi Province, in which the family planning law was suspended, suggested that families would not have many more children even if the law were abolished.&lt;ref name="NYT72212"/&gt; A 2003 review of the policy-making process behind the adoption of the one-child policy shows that less intrusive options, including those that emphasized delay and spacing of births, were known but not fully considered by China's political leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Greenhalgh, Susan|year=2003|title=Science, Modernity, and the Making of China's One-Child Policy|journal=Population and Development Review|volume=29|issue=June|pages=163–196|url=https://webspace.utexas.edu/cmm2436/china%27s_one-child_policy.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2003.00163.x|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029205950/https://webspace.utexas.edu/cmm2436/china%27s_one-child_policy.pdf|archivedate=29 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unequal enforcement===
Corrupted government officials and especially wealthy individuals have often been able to violate the policy in spite of fines.&lt;ref name="Chinanews"/&gt; Filmmaker Zhang Yimou had three children and was subsequently fined 7.48{{nbsp}}million yuan ($1.2{{nbsp}}million).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = China: Filmmaker Zhang Yimou fined $1M for breach of one-child policy - CNN.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/09/world/asia/filmmaker-one-child-policy-fine/index.html|website = CNN|accessdate = 3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, between 2000 and 2005, as many as 1,968 officials in central China's [[Hunan]] province were found to be violating the policy, according to the provincial family planning commission; also exposed by the commission were 21 national and local lawmakers, 24 political advisors, 112 entrepreneurs and 6 senior intellectuals.&lt;ref name="Chinanews"&gt;{{cite web | work=[[Xinhua]] | url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-07/08/content_912620.htm | title=Over 1,900 officials breach birth policy in C.

Some of the offending officials did not face penalties,&lt;ref name="Chinanews"/&gt; although the government did respond by raising fines and calling on local officials to "expose the celebrities and high-income people who violate the family planning policy and have more than one child".&lt;ref name="Chinanews"/&gt; Also, people who lived in the rural areas of China were allowed to have two children without punishment, although the family is required to wait a couple of years before having another child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=chan|first=peggy|title=Cultures of the world China|date=2005|publisher=Marshall Cavendish International|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights violations===
{{Further |Human rights in China}}
The one-child policy has been challenged for violating a [[human right]] to determine the size of one's own proper  family.

According to the UK newspaper ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', a quota of 20,000 abortions and sterilizations was set for [[Huaiji County]] in [[Guangdong]] Province in one year due to reported disregard of the one-child policy. According to the article local officials were being pressured into purchasing portable ultrasound devices to identify abortion candidates in remote villages. The article also reported that women as far along as 8.5 months pregnant were forced to abort, usually by an [[Instillation abortion|injection of saline solution]].&lt;ref name=abort&gt;{{cite news| title = Chinese region 'must conduct 20,000 abortions' | newspaper = [[The Telegraph (UK)|The Telegraph]] |date=8 April 2001 | last = McElroy | first = Damien | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/1336466/Chinese-region-must-conduct-20000-abortions.html | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1993 book by social scientist, [[Steven W.

In the past, China promoted [[eugenics]] as part of its population planning policies, but the government has backed away from such policies, as evidenced by China's ratification of the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], which compels the nation to significantly reform its genetic testing laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{subscription required}} {{cite journal| title = Implications of China's Ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/china/v008/8.1.petersen.html |journal=China: An International Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent{{when|date=October 2013}} research has also emphasized the necessity of understanding a myriad of complex social relations that affect the meaning of [[informed consent]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sleeboom-Faulkner|first=Margaret Elizabeth |title= Genetic testing, governance, and the family in the People's Republic of China|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |date=1 June 2011|volume=72|issue=11|pages=1802–9|doi= 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.03.052}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 2003, China revised its marriage registration regulations and couples no longer have to submit to a pre-marital physical or genetic examination before being granted a marriage license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China | url = http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/4b6fe19d6.pdf |newspaper= Australia: Refugee Review Tribunal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] offered the following summary as to the long term effects of [[sex-selective abortion]] and abandonment of female infants:

{{Quote|Multiple research studies have also found that sex-selective abortion – where a woman undergoes an ultrasound to determine the sex of her baby, and then aborts it if it's a girl – was widespread for years, particularly for second or subsequent children. Millions of female fetuses have been aborted since the 1970s.  China outlawed sex selective abortions in 2005, but the law is tough to enforce because of the difficulty of proving why a couple decided to have an abortion. The abandonment, and killing, of baby girls has also been reported, though recent research studies say it has become rare, in part due to strict criminal prohibitions.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca" /&gt;}}

Anthropologist [[G. William Skinner]] at the [[University of California, Davis]] and Chinese researcher Yuan Jianhua have claimed that infanticide was fairly common in China before the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| work = San Jose Mercury News | place = [[California|CA]] |date=15 March 2000|title=Experts Allege Infanticide In China — 'Missing' Girls Killed, Abandoned, Pair Say| last =Lubman | first = Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9075">Phytoextraction is a subprocess of [[phytoremediation]] in which plants remove dangerous elements or compounds from soil or water, most usually [[heavy metals]], metals that have a high density and may be toxic to organisms even at relatively low concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilpi.com/msds/ref/heavymetal.html&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy metals that plants extract are toxic to the plants as well, and the plants used for phytoextraction are known [[hyperaccumulator]]s that sequester extremely large amounts of heavy metals in their tissues. Phytoextraction can also be performed by plants that uptake lower levels of pollutants, but due to their high growth rate and biomass production, may remove a considerable amount of contaminants from the soil.&lt;ref&gt; Guidi Nissim W.,Palm E.,Mancuso S.,Azzarello E. (2018) “Trace element phytoextraction from contaminated soil: a case study under Mediterranean climate”. Environmental Science and Pollution Research https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-1197-x &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Heavy metals and biological system==
[[Heavy metal (chemistry)|Heavy metal]]s can be a major problem for any biological organism as they may be reactive with a number of chemicals essential to biological processes. 

They can also break apart other molecules into even more reactive species (such as:[[Reactive Oxygen Species]]), which also disrupt biological processes. These reactions deplete the concentration of important molecules and also produce dangerously reactive molecules such as the radicals O&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;.

Non-hyperaccumulators also absorb some concentration of heavy metals, as many heavy metals are chemically similar to other metals that are essential to the plants life.

==The process==
For a plant to extract a heavy metal from water or soil, five things need to happen. 
1.The metal must dissolve in something the plant roots can absorb.
2.The plant roots must absorb the heavy metal.
3.The plant must chelate the metal to both protect itself and make the metal more mobile(this can also happen before the metal is absorbed)j.
:[[Chelation]] is a process by which a metal is surrounded and chemically bonded to an organic compound. This process is displayed in the figure titled "Metal-EDTA Chelate"
4.The plant moves the chelated metal to a place to safely store it
5.Finally, the plant must adapt to any damages the metals cause during transportation and storage

===Dissolution===
In their normal states, metals cannot be taken into any organism. They must be dissolved as an ion in solution to be mobile in an organism.&lt;ref&gt;Misra V., Tiwari A., Shukla B. &amp; Seth C.S. (2009) Effects of soil amendments on the bioavailability of heavy metals from zinc mine tailings. Environmental Monitoring Assessment 155, 467–475.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the metal is mobile, it can either be directly transported over the root [[cell wall]] by a specific metal transporter or carried over by a specific agent. The plant roots mediate this process by secreting things that will capture the metal in the [[rhizosphere]] and then transport the metal over the cell wall. Some examples are: phytosiderophores, [[organic acids]], or [[carboxylates]] &lt;ref&gt;Han F., Shan X.Q., Zhang S.Z., Wen B. &amp; Owens G. (2006) Enhanced cadmium accumulation in maize roots – the impact of organic acids. Plant and Soil 289, 355–368.  
&lt;/ref&gt; If the metal is chelated at this point, then the plant does not need to chelate it later and the chelater serves as a case to conceal the metal from the rest of the plant. This is a way that a hyper-accumulator can protect itself from the toxic effects of poisonous metals.

===Root absorption===
The first thing that happens when a metal is absorbed is it binds to the root cell wall.&lt;ref&gt;Clemens S., Palmgren M.G. &amp; Krämer U. (2002) A long way ahead: understanding and engineering plant metal accumulation. Trends in Plant Science 7, 309–315.&lt;/ref&gt; The metal is then transported into the root. Some plants then store the metal through chelation or sequestration. Many specific transition metal ligands contributing to metal detoxification and transport are up-regulated in plants when metals are available in the rhizosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Seth, C. S., et al. "Phytoextraction of Toxic Metals: A Central Role for Glutathione." Plant, Cell and Environment (2011)SCOPUS. Web. 16 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point the metal can be alone or already sequestered by a chelating agent or other compound. To get to the [[xylem]], the metal must then pass through the root symplasm.

===Root-to-shoot transport===
The systems that transport and store heavy metals are the most critical systems in a hyper-accumulator because the heavy metals will damage the plant before they are stored.  
The root-to-shoot transport of heavy metals is strongly regulated by gene expression. The genes that code for metal transport systems in plants have been identified. These genes are expressed in both hyper-accumulating and non-hyper-accumulating plants. There is a large body of evidence that genes known to code for the transport systems of heavy metals are constantly over-expressed in hyper-accumulating plants when they are exposed to heavy metals.&lt;ref&gt;Rascio, N., and F. Navari-Izzo. "Heavy Metal Hyper-accumulating Plants: How and Why do they do it? and what Makes them so Interesting?" Plant Science 180.2 (2011): 169-81. SCOPUS. Web. 16 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This genetic evidence suggests that hyper-accumulators overdevelop their metal transport systems. This may be to speed up the root-to-shoot process limiting the amount of time the metal is exposed to the plant systems before it is stored. Cadmium accumulation has been reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;
 
These transporters are known as heavy metal transporting ATPases (HMAs).&lt;ref&gt;K.B. Axelsen and M.G. Palmgren, Inventory of the superfamily of P-Type ion pumps in Arabidopsis. Plant Physiol.,  126  (1998), pp. 696–706.&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the most well-documented HMAs is HMA4, which belongs to the Zn/Co/Cd/Pb HMA subclass and is localized at xylem parenchyma plasma membranes.&lt;ref&gt;Rascio, N., and F. Navari-Izzo. "Heavy Metal Hyper-accumulating Plants: How and Why do they do it? and what Makes them so Interesting?" Plant Science 180.2 (2011): 169-81. SCOPUS. Web. 16 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; HMA4 is upregulated when plants are exposed to high levels of Cd and Zn, but it is down regulated in its non-hyperaccumulating relatives.&lt;ref&gt;A. Papoyan and L.V. Kochian, Identification of Thlaspi caerulescens genes that may be involved in heavy metal hyper-accumulation and tolerance. Characterization of a novel heavy metal transporting ATPase. Plant Physiol.,  136  (2004), pp. 3814–3823.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, when the expression of HMA4 is increased there is a correlated increase in the expression of genes belonging to the ZIP (Zinc regulated transporter Iron regulated transporter Proteins) family. This suggests that the root-to-shoot transport system acts as a driving force of the hyper-accumulation by creating a metal deficiency response in roots.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hanikenne, et al. Evolution of metal hyper-accumulation required cis-regulatory changes and triplication of HMA4. Nature,  453  (2008), pp. 391–395&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storage===
Systems that transport and store heavy metals are the most critical systems in a hyper-accumulator, because heavy metals damage the plant before they are stored. Often in hyper accumulaters the heavy metals are stored in the leaves.

===How phytoextraction can be useful===

====For Plants====
There are several theories to explain why it would be beneficial for a plant to do this. 
#The "elemental defence" hypothesis assumes that maybe predators will avoid eating hyper accumulaters because of the heavy metals. At this time though scientists have not been able to determine a correlation.&lt;ref&gt;Rascio, N., and F. Navari-Izzo. "Heavy Metal Hyperaccumulating Plants: How and Why do they do it? and what Makes them so Interesting?" Plant Science 180.2 (2011): 169-81. SCOPUS. Web. 16 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2002 a study was done by the Department of Pharmacology at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University in Bangladesh that used [[Water Hyacinth]] to remove arsenic from water.&lt;ref&gt;Misbahuddin, M., and A. Fariduddin. "Water Hyacinth Removes Arsenic from Arsenic-Contaminated Drinking Water." Archives of Environmental Health 57.6 (2002): 516-8. SCOPUS. Web. 26 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This study proved that water could be completely purified of arsenic in a few hours and that the plant then could be used as animal feed, fire wood and many other practical purposes. Since water hyacinth is invasive it is inexpensive to grow and extremely practical.

The '''rational planning model''' is a model of the planning process involving a number of rational actions or steps. Taylor (1998) outlines five steps, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Urban Planning Theory since 1945|last = Taylor|first = Nigel|publisher = Sage Publications|year = 1998|isbn = |location = London|pages = 67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Definition of the problems and/or goals;
* Identification of alternative plans/policies;
* Evaluation of alternative plans/policies;
* Implementation of plans/policies;
* Monitoring of effects of plans/policies. 
The rational planning model is used in planning and designing neighborhoods, cities, and regions. It has been central in the development of modern [[urban planning]] and [[transportation planning]]. The model has many limitations, particularly the lack of guidance on involving stakeholders and the community affected by planning, and other models of planning, such as [[collaborative planning]], are now also widely used.

The very similar '''rational decision-making model''', as it is called in [[organizational behavior]], is a process for making logically sound decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robbins|first=Stephen P.|title=Organizational Behavior|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0132431569|edition=12th|pages=156–8|author2=Timothy A. Judge }}&lt;/ref&gt; This multi-step model and aims to be logical and follow the orderly path from problem identification through solution. Rational decision making is a multi-step process for making logically sound decisions that aims to follow the orderly path from problem identification through solution.

==Method==
Rational [[decision-making]] or [[planning]] follows a series of steps detailed below:

===Verify, define,detail the problem, give solution or alternative to the problem ===
Verifying, defining &amp; detailing the problem (problem definition, goal definition, information gathering).  This step includes recognizing the problem, defining an initial solution, and starting primary analysis.  Examples of this are creative devising, creative ideas, inspirations, breakthroughs, and [[Brainstorming|brainstorm]]s.

The very first step which is normally overlooked by the top level [[management]] is defining the exact problem. Though we think that the problem identification is obvious, many times it is not. The rational decision making model is a group-based decision making process. If the problem is not identified properly then we may face a problem as each and every member of the group might have a different definition of the problem.

===Generate all possible solutions===
This step encloses two to three final solutions to the problem and preliminary implementation to the site.  In planning, examples of this are Planned Units of Development and downtown revitalizations.

This activity is best done in groups, as different people may contribute different ideas or alternative solutions to the problem.  Without alternative solutions, there is a chance of arriving at a non-optimal or a rational decision. For exploring the alternatives it is necessary to gather information. Technology may help with gathering this information.

===Generate objective assessment criteria===
Evaluative criteria are measurements to determine success and failure of alternatives.  This step contains secondary and final analysis along with secondary solutions to the problem.  Examples of this are site suitability and site sensitivity analysis. After going thoroughly through the process of defining the problem, exploring for all the possible alternatives for that problem and gathering information this step says evaluate the information and the possible options to anticipate the consequences of each and every possible alternative that is thought of.  At this point optional criteria for measuring the success or failure of the decision taken needs to be considered.
The rational model of planning rest largely on objective assessment.

===Choose the best solution generated===
This step comprises a final solution and secondary implementation to the site.  At this point the process has developed into different strategies of how to apply the solutions to the site.

Based on the criteria of assessment and the analysis done in previous steps, choose the best solution generated.  These four steps form the core of the Rational Decision Making Model.

===Implement the preferred alternative===
This step includes final implementation to the site and preliminary monitoring of the outcome and results of the site.  This step is the building/renovations part of the process.

===Monitor and evaluate outcomes and results===
This step contains the secondary and final monitoring of the outcomes and results of the site.  This step takes place over a long period of time.

=== Feedback===
Modify future decisions and actions taken based on the above evaluation of outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Michael P.|title=Planning Theory for Practitioners|year=2002|publisher=American Planning Association|location=Chicago|pages=175–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discourse of rational planning model used in policy making==
The rational model of decision-making is a process for making sound decisions in policy making in the public sector. Rationality is defined as “a style of behavior that is appropriate to the achievement of given goals, within the limits imposed by given conditions and constraints”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Simon, Herbert |title=[[Administrative Behavior]] |publisher=The Free Press |location=New York |year=1976 |edition=3rd |isbn=0-684-83582-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note the model makes a series of assumptions in order for it to work, such as:

*The model must be applied in a system that is stable,
*The government is a rational and unitary actor and that its actions are perceived as rational choices,
*The policy problem is unambiguous,
*There are no limitations of time or cost.

Indeed, some of the assumptions identified above are also pin pointed out in a study written by the historian H.A. Drake, as he states:

''In its purest form, the Rational Actor approach presumes that such a figure [as Constantine] has complete freedom of action to achieve goals that he or she has articulated through a careful process of rational analysis involving full and objective study of all pertinent information and alternatives. At the same time, it presumes that this central actor is so fully in control of the apparatus of government that a decision once made is as good as implemented. There are no  staffs on which to rely, no constituencies to placate, no generals or governors to cajole. By attributing all decision making to one central figure who is always fully in control and who acts only after carefully weighing all options, the Rational Actor method allows scholars to filter out extraneous details and focus attention on central issues''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Drake, H.A. |title=Constantine and the Bishops: The Politics of Intolerance |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, as we have seen, in the context of policy rational models are intended to achieve maximum social gain. For this purpose, Simon identifies an outline of a step by step mode of analysis to achieve rational decisions. Ian Thomas describes Simon's steps as follows:

#Intelligence gathering— data and potential problems and opportunities are identified, collected and analyzed.
#Identifying problems
#Assessing the consequences of all options
#Relating consequences to values— with all decisions and policies there will be a set of values which will be more relevant (for example, economic feasibility and environmental protection) and which can be expressed as a set of criteria, against which performance (or consequences) of each option can be judged.
#Choosing the preferred option— given the full understanding of all the problems and opportunities, all the consequences and the criteria for judging options.&lt;ref name=Thomas07&gt;{{cite book |editor=Thomas, Ian |title=Environmental Policy: Australian Practice in the Context of Theory |publisher=Federation Press |location=Sydney |year=2007 |isbn=1-86287-603-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In similar lines, Wiktorowicz and Deber describe through their study on ‘Regulating biotechnology: a rational-political model of policy development’ the rational approach to policy development. The main steps involved in making a rational decision for these authors are the following:

#The comprehensive organization and analysis of the information
#The potential consequences of each option
#The probability that each potential outcome would materialize
#The value (or utility) placed on each potential outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wiktorowicz, Mary |author2=Deber, Raisa |title=Regulating biotechnology: a rational-political Model of policy development |journal=Health Policy Journal |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=115–138 |date=May 1997 |doi=10.1016/S0168-8510(96)00889-5 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V8X-3SWTKM6-3&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=05%2F31%2F1997&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_origin=browse&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=fff8e9fe6163caa0b6011b53c3aa37dd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach of Wiktorowicz and Deber is similar to Simon and they assert that the rational model tends to deal with “the facts” (data, probabilities) in steps 1 to 3, leaving the issue of assessing values to the final step. According to Wiktorowicz and Deber values are introduced in the final step of the rational model, where the utility of each policy option is assessed.

Many authors have attempted to interpret the above-mentioned steps, amongst others, Patton and Sawicki &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Patton, C., Sawicki, D. |title=Basic methods of policy analysis and planning |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=NJ |year=1986 |isbn=0-13-060948-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; who summarize the model as presented in the following figure (missing):

#Defining the problem by analyzing the data and the information gathered.
#Identifying the decision criteria that will be important in solving the problem. The decision maker must determine the relevant factors to take into account when making the decision.
#A brief list of the possible alternatives must be generated; these could succeed to resolve the problem.
#A critical analyses and evaluation of each criterion is brought through. For example, strength and weakness tables of each alternative are drawn and used for comparative basis.  The decision maker then weights the previously identified criteria in order to give the alternative policies a correct priority in the decision.
#The decision-maker evaluates each alternative against the criteria and selects the preferred alternative.
#The policy is brought through.

The model of rational decision-making has also proven to be very useful to several decision making processes in industries outside the public sphere. Nonetheless, many criticisms of the model arise due to claim of the model being impractical and lying on unrealistic assumptions.  For instance, it is a difficult model to apply in the public sector because social problems can be very complex, ill-defined and interdependent. The problem lies in the thinking procedure implied by the model which is linear and can face difficulties in extra ordinary problems or social problems which have no sequences of happenings. This latter argument can be best illustrated by the words of Thomas R. Dye, the president of the Lincoln Center for Public Service, who wrote in his book `Understanding Public Policy´ the following passage:

''There is no better illustration of the dilemmas of rational policy making in America than in the field of health…the first obstacle to rationalism is defining the problem. Is our goal to have good health — that is, whether we live at all (infant mortality), how well we live (days lost to sickness), and how long we live (life spans and adult mortality)? Or is our goal to have good medical care — frequent visits to the doctor, wellequipped and accessible hospitals, and equal access to medical care by rich and poor alike?''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dye, Thomas R. |title=Understanding Public Policy |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=12th |year=2007 |isbn=0-13-936948-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problems faced when using the rational model arise in practice because social and environmental values can be difficult to quantify and forge consensus around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1005469411776 |author1=Morgan M.G. |author2=Kandlikar M. |author3=Risbey J. |author4=Dowlatabadi H. |title=Why Conventional Tools for Policy Analysis Are Often Inadequate for Problems of Global Change |journal=Climatic Change |volume=41 |issue=3–4 |pages=271–281 |date=19 March 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the assumptions stated by Simon are never fully valid in a real world context.

However, as Thomas states the rational model provides a good perspective since in modern society rationality plays a central role and everything that is rational tends to be prized. Thus, it does not seem strange that “we ought to be trying for rational decision-making”.&lt;ref name=Thomas07/&gt;

===Decision criteria for policy analysis — Step 2===

As illustrated in Figure 1, rational policy analysis can be broken into 6 distinct stages of analysis. Step 2 highlights the need to understand which factors should be considered as part of the decision making process. At this part of the process, all the economic, social, and environmental factors that are important to the policy decision need to be identified and then expressed as policy decision criteria. For example, the decision criteria used in the analysis of environmental policy is often a mix of —

* [[Environmental impact assessment|Ecological impacts]] —  such as [[biodiversity]], [[water quality]], [[air quality]], [[Habitat conservation|habitat quality]], species [[population]], etc.
* [[Economic efficiency]] — commonly expressed as benefits and costs.
* [[Welfare economics|Distributional equity]] — how policy impacts are distributed amongst different demographics. Factors that can affect the distribution of impacts include location, ethnicity, income, and occupation.
* [[Cultural psychology|Social/Cultural acceptability]] — the extent to which the policy action may be opposed by current [[Norm (social)|social norms]] or [[Value theory|cultural values]].
* [[Implementation|Operational practicality]] — the capacity required to actually operationalize the policy.
* Legality — the potential for the policy to be implemented under current legislation versus the need to pass new legislation that accommodates the policy.
* Uncertainty — the degree to which the level of policy impacts can be known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Loomis, John |author2=Helfand, Gloria |title=Environmental Policy Analysis for Decision Making |publisher=Kluwer Academic |year=2001 |isbn=0-7923-6500-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some criteria, such as economic benefit, will be more easily measurable or definable, while others such as environmental quality will be harder to measure or express quantitatively. Ultimately though, the set of decision criteria needs to embody all of the policy goals, and overemphasising the more easily definable or measurable criteria, will have the undesirable impact of biasing the analysis towards a subset of the policy goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weimer|Vining|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of identifying a suitably comprehensive decision criteria set is also vulnerable to being skewed by pressures arising at the political interface. For example, decision makers may tend to give "''more weight to policy impacts that are concentrated, tangible, certain, and immediate than to impacts that are diffuse, intangible, uncertain, and delayed''."^8. For example, with a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions the net financial cost in the first five years of policy implementation is a far easier impact to conceptualise than the more diffuse and uncertain impact of a country's improved position to influence [[Post–Kyoto Protocol negotiations on greenhouse gas emissions|global negotiations on climate change action]].

===Decision methods for policy analysis — Step 5===

Displaying the impacts of policy alternatives can be done using a policy analysis matrix (PAM) such that shown in Table 1. As shown, a PAM provides a summary of the policy impacts for the various alternatives and examination of the matrix can reveal the tradeoffs associated with the different alternatives.

Table 1. Policy analysis matrix (PAM) for SO2 emissions control.

Once policy alternatives have been evaluated, the next step is to decide which policy alternative should be implemented. This is shown as step 5 in Figure 1. At one extreme, comparing the policy alternatives can be relatively simple if all the policy goals can be measured using a single metric and given equal weighting. In this case, the decision method is an exercise in benefit cost analysis (BCA).
 
At the other extreme, the numerous goals will require the policy impacts to be expressed using a variety of metrics that are not readily comparable. In such cases, the policy analyst may draw on the concept of utility to aggregate the various goals into a single score. With the utility concept, each impact is given a weighting such that 1 unit of each weighted impact is considered to be equally valuable (or desirable) with regards to the collective well-being.

Weimer and Vining also suggest that the "''go, no go''" rule can be a useful method for deciding amongst policy alternatives^8. Under this decision making regime, some or all policy impacts can be assigned thresholds which are used to eliminate at least some of the policy alternatives. In their example, one criterion "''is to minimize SO2 emissions''" and so a threshold might be a reduction SO2 emissions "of at least 8.0 million tons per year". As such, any policy alternative that does not meet this threshold can be removed from consideration. If only a single policy alternative satisfies all the impact thresholds then it is the one that is considered a "go" for each impact. Otherwise it might be that all but a few policy alternatives are eliminated and those that remain need to be more closely examined in terms of their trade-offs so that a decision can be made.

===Case study of rational policy analysis===

To demonstrate the rational analysis process as described above, let’s examine the policy paper “Stimulating the use of biofuels in the European Union: Implications for climate change policy” by Lisa Ryan where the substitution of fossil fuels with biofuels has been proposed in the European Union (EU) between 2005–2010 as part of a strategy to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from road transport, increase security of energy supply and support development of rural communities.

Considering the steps of Patton and Sawicki model as in Figure 1 above, this paper only follows components 1 to 5 of the rationalist policy analysis model:

# Defining The Problem – the report identifies transportation fuels pose two important challenges for the European Union (EU). First, under the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol to the Climate Change Convention, the EU has agreed to an absolute cap on greenhouse gas emissions; while, at the same time increased consumption of transportation fuels has resulted in a trend of increasing greenhouse gas emissions from this source. Second, the dependence upon oil imports from the politically volatile Middle East generates concern over price fluctuations and possible interruptions in supply. Alternative fuel sources need to be used &amp; substituted in place of fossil fuels to mitigate GHG emissions in the EU.
# Determine the Evaluation Criteria – this policy sets Environmental impacts/benefits (reduction of GHG’s as a measure to reducing climate change effects) and Economical efficiency (the costs of converting to biofuels as alternative to fossil fuels &amp; the costs of production of biofuels from its different potential sources)as its decision criteria.  However, this paper does not exactly talk about the social impacts, this policy may have. It also does not compare the operational challenges involved between the different categories of biofuels considered.
# Identifying Alternative Policies – The European Commission foresees that three alternative transport fuels: hydrogen, natural gas, and biofuels, will replace transport fossil fuels, each by 5% by 2020.
# Evaluating Alternative Policies – Biofuels are an alternative motor vehicle fuel produced from biological material and are promoted as a transitional step until more advanced technologies have matured. By modelling the efficiency of the biofuel options the authors compute the economic and environmental costs of each biofuel option as per the evaluation criteria mentioned above.
# Select The Preferred Policy – The authors suggest that the overall best biofuel comes from the sugarcane in Brazil after comparing the economic &amp; the environmental costs. The current cost of subsidising the price difference between European biofuels and fossil fuels per tonne of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions saved is calculated to be €229–2000. If the production of European biofuels for transport is to be encouraged, exemption from excise duties is the instrument that incurs the least transactions costs, as no separate administrative or collection system needs to be established. A number of entrepreneurs are producing biofuels at the lower margin of the costs specified here profitably, once an excise duty rebate is given. It is likely that growth in the volume of the business will engender both economies of scale and innovation that will reduce costs substantially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2005.06.010 |author1=Ryan L. |author2=Convery F. |author3=Ferreira S. |title=Stimulating the use of biofuels in the European Union: Implications for climate change policy |journal=Energy Policy |volume=34 |issue=17 |pages=3184–94 |date=November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements and limitations==
However, there are a lot of assumptions, requirements without which the rational decision model is a failure. Therefore, they all have to be considered. 
The model assumes that we have or should or can obtain adequate information, both in terms of quality, quantity and accuracy. This applies to the situation as well as the alternative technical situations. It further assumes that you have or should or can obtain substantive knowledge of the cause and effect relationships relevant to the evaluation of the alternatives. In other words, it assumes that you have a thorough knowledge of all the alternatives and the consequences of the alternatives chosen. It further assumes that you can rank the alternatives and choose the best of it. 
The following are the limitations for the Rational Decision Making Model:

* requires a great deal of time
* requires great deal of information
* assumes rational, measurable criteria are available and agreed upon
* assumes accurate, stable and complete knowledge of all the alternatives, preferences, goals and consequences
* assumes a rational, reasonable, non – political world

==Current status==
While the rational planning model was innovative at its conception, the concepts are controversial and '''questionable processes today.''' The rational planning model has fallen out of mass use as of the last decade. Rather than conceptualising human agents as rational planners, [[Lucy Suchman]] argues, agents can better be understood as engaging in [[situated action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Suchman|first=Lucy|title=Human-Machine Reconfigurations: Plans and Situation Action|year=2007|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; Going further, [[Guy Benveniste]] argued that the rational model could not be implemented without taking the political context into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benveniste|first=Guy|title=Mastering the Politics of Planning|year=1994|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Since the 1960s, Roy Ascott has been a practitioner of [[interactive]] [[computer art]], [[electronic art]], [[cybernetic art]] and [[telematic art]].


The historian of art and technology [[Frank Popper]] writes of Roy Ascott:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Frank|title=From Technological to Virtual Art|year=2007|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-262-16230-2|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Roy Ascott was among the first artists to launch an appeal for total spectator participation ... At present, Ascott is one of the most outstanding artists and theoreticians in the field of telematics.
}}

In his first show (1964) at the Molton Gallery, London [http://telematic.walkerart.org/timeline/timeline_shanken.html], he exhibited ''Analogue Structures and Diagram Boxes'', comprising change-paintings and other works in wood, perspex and glass. In 1964 Ascott published "Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision" in ''Cybernetica: journal of the International Association for Cybernetics'' (Namur). In 1968,  he was elected Associate Member of the Institution of Computer Science, London (proposed by [[Gordon Pask]]). In 1972, he became a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Arts]].

Ascott has shown at the [[Venice Biennale]], [[Shanghai Biennale]], Electra Paris, [[Ars Electronica]], [[V2 Institute for the Unstable Media]]  [http://framework.v2.nl/archive/archive/leaf/other/default.xslt/nodenr-143122], Milan Triennale, Biennale do Mercosul, [[Brazil]], European Media Festival, and gr2000az at [[Graz]], Austria. His first telematic project was ''La Plissure du Texte'' (1983),  [http://telematic.walkerart.org/timeline/timeline_ascott.html]  an online work of "distributed authorship" involving artists around the world. The second was his "gesamtdatenwerk" ''Aspects of Gaia: Digital Pathways across the Whole Earth'' (1989), an installation for the [[Ars Electronica]] Festival in Linz, discussed by  (inter alia) Matthew Wilson Smith in ''The Total Work of Art: from Bayreuth to Cyberspace'', New York: Routledge, 2007. Retrospective exhibitions of his work were shown in May 2009 at Plymouth Arts Centre, England,  then in the Incheon International Digital Arts Festival, Incheon, South Korea in September 2010, and at [[SPACE (studios)]] in Hackney, London in 2011. ''Syncretic Cybernetics'', a comprehensive exhibition of his work, was featured in the 9th [[Shanghai Biennale]] 2012. ''Roy Ascott: The Analogues'' (featuring his work of the 1960s) was shown at the Plug-in Institute ofContemporary Arts [http://www.plugin.org/exhibitions/2013/roy-ascott-analogues], Winnipeg, July-Sept 2013. In September 2014, a mini retrospective of his work was shown in Linz, at the time of his Ars Electronica Golden Nica award [http://www.art-in-berlin.de/royascott2.mp4]. He discussed his work on Geran TV [http://www.art-in-tv.de/videoplaytv.php?id=1525].
The seminal work of 1962, "Video-Roget" [http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/ascott-video-roget-t13977] was acquired in 2014, by the Tate Gallery, London for its permanent collection. Two key works were included in "Electronic Superhighway", at the Whitechapel Gallery, London in 2016 [http://www.whitechapelgallery.org/about/press/press-release-electronic-superhighway/]. "Art in Europe 1945-68" shown in ZKM, Karlsruhr, Germany Oct 2016/ Jan 2017, included his "Change-painting 1966" [http://zkm.de/en/event/2016/10/art-in-europe-1945-1968]. His early work was the subject of the exhibition "Roy Ascott: Form has Behaviour", at the Henry Moore Institute, Leeds, Jan/Apr 2017 [https://www.henry-moore.org/whats-on/2017/01/25/roy-ascott-form-has-behaviour]. 

== Interactive computer art ==
Since the 1960s, Ascott has been a working with interactive [[computer art]], [[telematic art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artmuseum.net/w2vr/timeline/Ascott.html artmuseum.net]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[systems art]]. Ascott built a theoretical framework for approaching interactive artworks, which brought together certain characteristics of [[Dada]], [[Surrealism]], [[Fluxus]], [[Happenings]], and [[Pop Art]] with the science of [[cybernetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plymouthartscentre.org/art/royascott.html|title=Plymouth Arts Centre Blog|work=Plymouth Arts Centre Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also influenced by the writings of [[Gordon Pask]], [[Anthony Stafford Beer]], [[William Ross Ashby]], and [[Frank Honywill George|F.H. George]].&lt;ref&gt;A critical survey of Ascott's work is provided by [[Edward A. Shanken]] in his introductory essay "From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott" in Ascott, R. 2003.

The '''statistical correlations of criminal behavior''' explore the associations of specific non-criminal factors with specific crimes.

The field of [[criminology]] studies the dynamics of crime. Most of these studies use [[Correlation (statistics)|correlational]] data; that is, they attempt to identify various factors are associated with specific categories of criminal behavior. Such correlational studies led to hypotheses about the causes of these crimes.

''The Handbook of Crime Correlates'' (2009) is a systematic review of 5200 empirical studies on crime that have been published worldwide. A crime consistency score represents the strength of relationships. The scoring depends on how consistently a [[statistically significant]] relationship was identified across multiple studies. The authors claim that the review summarizes most of what is currently known about the variables associated with criminality.{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}}

==Gender and biology==
{{anchor|Genetics}}
{{Main article|Sex differences in crime}}
Crime occurs most frequently during the second and third decades of life. Males commit more crime overall and more violent crime than females. They commit more property crime except [[shoplifting]], which is about equally distributed between the genders. Males appear to be more likely to [[Recidivism|reoffend]]. Measures related to [[arousal]] such as [[heart rate]] and [[skin conductance]] are low among criminals. [[Mesomorphic]] or muscular body type is positively correlated with criminality, in particular with sexual crimes. [[Testosterone]] levels positively correlate to criminal behavior.{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}}

When controlling for age and sex, strong [[human genetics|genetic]] correlates with criminality. Low [[monoamine oxidase]] activity and low [[5-HIAA]] levels tend to be found among criminals.{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}} [[Monoamine oxidase A]] (dubbed the "warrior gene" in the popular press) is strongly tied to an increased tendency towards [[violent crime]]. In addition, [[CDH13]], a gene previously tied to an increased risk of [[substance abuse]], has been tied to violent crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Genetic background of extreme violent behavior|journal = Molecular Psychiatry|pages = 786–792|volume = 20|issue = 6|doi = 10.1038/mp.2014.130|first = J|last = Tiihonen|first2 = M-R|last2 = Rautiainen|first3 = H M|last3 = Ollila|first4 = E|last4 = Repo-Tiihonen|first5 = M|last5 = Virkkunen|first6 = A|last6 = Palotie|first7 = O|last7 = Pietiläinen|first8 = K|last8 = Kristiansson|first9 = M|last9 = Joukamaa|pmid=25349169|pmc=4776744|year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tendencies are ostensibly related, as the majority of all individuals who commit severe violent crime [[Crime in Finland|in Finland]] do so under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The presence of the genetic profile is not determinative, although it increases the likelihood of [[wiktionary:Delinquency|delinquency]] in cases where other factors are present. Ferguson stated,  'a large percentage of our behaviour in terms of violence or aggression is influenced by our biology - our genes - and our brain anatomy.'&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29760212 |title=Two genes linked with violent crime |last=Hogenboom |first=Melissa |date=2014-10-28 |work=BBC News |access-date=2018-02-19 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schnupp stated, 'To call these alleles "genes for violence" would therefore be a massive exaggeration. In combination with many other factors these genes may make it a little harder for you to control violent urges, but they most emphatically do not predetermine you for a life of crime.'&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

==Race, ethnicity and immigration==
{{main|Race and crime|Immigration and crime}}
Associated factors include [[race and crime]] and [[immigration and crime|status as an immigrant]]. In some countries, ethnically/racially diverse geographical areas have higher crime rates compared to homogeneous areas, and in other countries, it is the other way around. Some studies on [[immigrants]] found higher rates of crime among these populations; these rates vary according to the country of origin (immigrants from some regions having lower crime rates than the indigenous population).{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}} Notions about the propensity for immigrants to commit crime vary among geographical regions. Likewise, the propensity for immigrants to commit more or less crime than the indigenous population also varies geographically. For instance within the United States, census data shows that immigrants are less likely to commit crime than residents who were born within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/immigrants-commit-crimes-us-united-states-born-america-donald-trump-alien-weekly-list-a7548956.html|title=Immigrants less likely to commit crimes than those born in the US|date=2017-01-27|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-03-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Associated factors include [[Smoking and pregnancy|maternal smoking during pregnancy]], [[Low birth weight]], [[perinatal]] trauma/birth complications,{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}}&lt;ref name="Monea2011"&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health|date = June 2011|volume = 43|issue = 2|vauthors=Monea J, Thomas A |title = Unintended pregnancy and taxpayer spending|pages = 88–93|doi = 10.1363/4308811|pmid = 21651707}}&lt;/ref&gt; child maltreatment, low parent-child attachment, marital discord/family discord, alcoholism and drug use in the family, low parental supervision/monitoring, family size and birth order,{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}} [[nocturnal enuresis]] or bed wetting, [[bullying]], school disciplinary problems, [[truancy]], low [[grade point average]], dropping out of high school{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}} and childhood lead exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/lead-crime-link-gasoline?page=1|title=Sick Kids Are Just the Beginning of America’s Lead Crisis|work=Mother Jones|access-date=2017-03-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adult behavior==
Associated factors include high alcohol use, alcohol abuse and alcoholism, high illegal drug use and dependence, early age of first sexual intercourse and the number of sexual partners, social isolation, criminal peer groups and gang membership.{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}}

==Religion==
A few studies have found a negative correlation between [[religiosity]] and criminality. A 2001 [[meta-analysis]] found, "religious beliefs and behaviors exert a moderate deterrent effect on individuals' criminal behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0022427801038001001 | title="If You Love Me, Keep My Commandments": A Meta-Analysis of the Effect of Religion on Crime | journal=Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency | date=2001 | volume=38 | issue=1 | pages=3–21 | first=C.

DAVID | last=EVANS}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual with high religious saliency (i.e. expressing the high importance of religion in their life) is less likely to be associated with criminal activities; similarly, an individual who regularly attends religious services or is highly involved in them tends to be less involved in criminality, with the exception of property damage.{{Sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}}{{rp|108}} Other meta-analysis research suggests that those who subscribe to more orthodox religious beliefs are less likely to engage in criminal behavior than those who do not.{{Sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}}{{rp|112}}

A 1997 study of six public schools found no statistically significant negative correlations between religiosity and crime, or religiosity and drug use, and the only relationship between religiosity and alcohol was statistically significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0022427897034002001 | title=An Examination of a Reciprocal Relationship Between Religiosity and Different Forms of Delinquency Within a Theoretical Model | journal=Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency | date=1997 | volume=34 | issue=2 | pages=163–186 | first=B. B. | last=BENDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A more recent review concludes that there are insufficient data to indicate any correlation between religiosity and crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Atheism, Secularity, and Well-Being: How the Findings of Social Science Counter Negative Stereotypes and Assumptions|journal = Sociology Compass|date = 2009-12-01|issn = 1751-9020|pages = 949–971|volume = 3|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/j.1751-9020.2009.00247.x|first = Phil|last = Zuckerman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political ideology==
A 2016 study found statistically significant evidence that political ideology is moderately correlated with involvement in non-violent but not violent crime, among White individuals and particularly among White women. It suggests that liberal self-classification can, among some groups, be positively associated with non-violent criminal behavior compared to conservative self-classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | authors=Wright, J.P., et al. | title = Political ideology predicts involvement in crime, Personality and Individual Differences | date = 2016 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2016.10.062 | volume=106 | journal=Personality and Individual Differences | pages=236–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological traits==
Associated factors include childhood [[conduct disorder]], adult [[antisocial personality disorder]] (also associated with each other),{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}}&lt;ref name="WilsonPetersilia2002"&gt;{{cite book |first1=James Q.|last1= Wilson|first2=Joan |authorlink1=James Q.

The [[American Psychological Association]]'s 1995 report ''Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns'' stated that the correlation between IQ and crime was -0.2. In his book ''[[The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability]]'' (1998), Arthur Jensen cited data which showed that IQ was generally negatively associated with crime among people of all races, peaking between 80 and 90.  Learning disability is a substantial discrepancy between IQ and academic performance and is associated with crime. Slow reading development may be particularly relevant.{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}}

Several personality traits are associated with criminality: [[impulsivity]], [[psychoticism]], [[sensation-seeking]], (low) [[self control]], childhood [[aggression]], low [[empathy]] and low [[altruism]].{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}}

==Socioeconomic factors==
[[Socioeconomic status]] (usually measured using the three variables income (or wealth), occupational level, and years of education) correlates negatively with criminality, except for self-reported illegal drug use. Higher parental socioeconomic status probably has an inverse relationship with crime.

Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 896(1), pp.131-144.&lt;/ref&gt; These higher stress levels would probably be correlated positively with the propensity to commit a crime. 

Somewhat inconsistent evidence indicates a positive relationship between low income levels, the percentage of population under the poverty line, low education levels, and high income inequality in an area with more crime in said area.{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}}

A World Bank study said, “Crime rates and inequality&amp;nbsp;are positively correlated within countries and, particularly, between countries, and&amp;nbsp;this correlation reflects causation from inequality to crime rates, even after controlling&amp;nbsp;for other crime determinants.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fajnzylber | first1 = P. | last2 = Lederman | first2 = D. | last3 = Loayza | first3 = N. | year = 2002 | title = Inequality and violent crime | url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DEC/Resources/Crime%26Inequality.pdf | format = PDF | journal = The Journal of Law and Economics | volume = 45 | issue = 1| pages = 1–39 | doi=10.1086/338347| citeseerx = 10.1.1.559.483 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic factors==
Associated factors include areas with population size, neighborhood quality, residential mobility, tavern and alcohol density, gambling and tourist density, proximity to the equator,{{sfn|Ellis|Beaver|Wright|2009}} temperature ([[weather]] and season).

==Biosocial criminology and other analysis of environmental factors==
{{main|Biosocial criminology|Environmental criminology}}
[[Biosocial criminology]] is an [[interdisciplinary]] field that aims to explain crime and antisocial behavior by exploring both biological factors and environmental factors. While contemporary criminology has been dominated by [[sociological]] theories, biosocial criminology also recognizes the potential contributions of fields such as [[genetics]], [[neuropsychology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]].&lt;ref name=Asghate2011&gt;{{cite book|first1=Anthony |last1=Walsh|first2=Kevin M |last2=Beaver|chapter=Biosocial Criminology|title=The Ashgate Research Companion to Biosocial Theories of Crime|chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=V9KhAgAAQBAJ}}|date=28 January 2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-9470-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggressive behavior has been associated with abnormalities in three principal regulatory systems in the body: 
* [[serotonin|serotonin systems]], 
* [[catecholamine|catecholamine systems]], 
* and the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis]]. 
Abnormalities in these systems also are known to be induced by [[Stress (biology)|stress]], either severe, acute stress or chronic low-grade stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=WALTON K.

In environmental terms, the [[Lead and crime hypothesis|theory that crime rates and lead exposure]] are connected, with increases in the latter causing increases in the former, has attracted much scientific analysis. In 2011, a report published by the official United Nations News Centre remarked, "Ridding the world of leaded petrol, with the United Nations leading the effort in developing countries, has resulted in $2.4 trillion in annual benefits, 1.2 million fewer premature deaths, higher overall intelligence and 58 million fewer crimes". The [[California State University]] did the specific study. Then [[United Nations Environment Programme|U.N. Environment Programme]] (UNEP) executive director [[Achim Steiner]] argued, "Although this global effort has often flown below the radar of media and global leaders, it is clear that the elimination of leaded petrol is an immense achievement on par with the global elimination of major deadly diseases."&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40226&amp;Cr=pollutant&amp;Cr1=#.UZdkooJAsR4|title=Phase-out of leaded petrol brings huge health and cost benefits – UN–backed study|date=27 October 2011|accessdate=11 November 2016|publisher=[[United Nations News Centre]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tharrawaddy Min Bell''' ({{lang-my|သာယာဝတီမင်း ခေါင်းလောင်းတော်}}), also known as the '''Maha Tissada Gandha Bell''', is a large [[Bell (instrument)|bell]] located at the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] in [[Yangon]], [[Myanmar]] (Burma). It was donated in 1841 by [[Tharrawaddy Min|King Tharrawaddy]], of [[Konbaung Dynasty]]. The official [[Pali]] name of the bell is Maha Tissada Gandha, which means "Great Three-toned Sweet Sound".&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com.mm/books?id=NWJI4bK9kQ8C&amp;pg=PT233&amp;lpg=PT233&amp;dq=Tharrawaddy+Min+bell&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KTaaw_VbAd&amp;sig=yJiRpgw4T3ASZathHCiIKb2MC7I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9xFBU_CeM8uCrgeRz4CoDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Tharrawaddy%20Min%20bell&amp;f=false |title=Asian Art - MobileReference - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com.mm |date= |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sacred-destinations1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/burma/yangon-shwedagon-pagoda |title=Shwedagon Pagoda - Yangon, Burma |publisher=Sacred-destinations.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History of the Shwedagon Pagoda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shwedagon.org/history.php |title=History of the Shwedagon Pagoda |publisher=Shwedagon.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="towerbells1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.towerbells.org/data/APGreatBellsO.html |title=Great Bells - Asia and the Pacific Rim |publisher=Towerbells.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On 24 September 1841 (10th waxing of [[Thadingyut]] 1203 [[Burmese calendar|ME]]), King Tharrawaddy commissioned a 42-ton bell called the Maha Tissada Gandha ("great three-toned sweet sound") Bell and 20 kilograms (44&amp;nbsp;lbs) of gold plating to the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon.&lt;ref name=ksy-32/&gt;&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sacred-destinations1"/&gt; The king appointed two ministers Maha Sithu and Maha Min Kyaw Thinkhaya to oversee the casting project, which began on 20 January 1842 (10th waxing of [[Tabodwe]] 1203 ME).&lt;ref name=ksy-32/&gt;

==Current status==
The bell is housed in a pavilion, located on the northeast side of the pagoda's middle terrace.&lt;ref name="sacred-destinations1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="History of the Shwedagon Pagoda"/&gt;&lt;ref name="towerbells1"/&gt;

'''''The New Jerusalem''''' is a [[1920 in literature|1920]] [[book]] written by British writer [[G. K. Chesterton]]. Dale Ahlquist calls it a "philosophical travelogue" of Chesterton's journey across Europe to [[Mandate Palestine|Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahlquist|first=Dale|title=Lecture XXXV: The New Jerusalem|url=http://www.chesterton.org/discover/lectures/35newjerusalem.html|publisher=The American Chesterton Society|accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
*"On the road to Cairo one may see twenty groups exactly like that of the Holy Family in the pictures of the Flight into Egypt; with only one difference. The man is riding on the ass."
*"The real mistake of the Muslims is something much more modern in its application than any particular passing persecution of Christians as such. It lay in the very fact that they did think they had a simpler and saner sort of Christianity, as do many modern Christians. They thought it could be made universal merely by being made uninteresting. Now a man preaching what he thinks is a platitude is far more intolerant than a man preaching what he admits is a paradox. It was exactly because it seemed self-evident, to Muslims as to Bolshevists, that their simple creed was suited to everybody, that they wished in that particular sweeping fashion to impose it on everybody."

[[Image:G-sharp-major e-sharp-minor.png|thumb|G{{music|#}} major, a key signature with a double-sharp.]]
[[Image:A-flat-major f-minor.svg|thumb|A{{music|b}} major, equivalent key signature without double-sharps or flats.]]

In [[music theory]], a '''theoretical key''' or '''impossible key''' is a [[key (music)|key]] whose [[key signature]] has at least one [[Flat (music)|double-flat]] or [[Sharp (music)|double-sharp]].
 
Double-flats and double-sharps are often used as [[accidental (music)|accidentals]], but placing them in the key signature (in music that uses [[equal temperament]]) makes the music generally impractical to read.

For example, the key of [[G-sharp major|G{{music|#}} major]] is a key of this type, because its corresponding [[key signature]] has an F{{Music|doublesharp}} (on its [[leading-tone]]). An equal-tempered [[Musical scale|scale]] of G{{music|#}} major comprises the same pitches as the [[A-flat major|A{{music|b}} major]] scale, so that the two scales sound exactly the same; such key pairs are said to be [[enharmonic|enharmonically equivalent]]. Consequently, the theoretical key of G{{music|#}} major is usually notated as A{{music|b}} major.

{|class="wikitable"
|A{{music|b}} major:||A{{music|b}}||B{{Music|b}}||C||D{{music|b}}||E{{music|b}}||F||G
|-
|G{{Music|#}} major:||G{{Music|#}}||A{{Music|#}}||B{{Music|#}}||C{{Music|#}}||D{{Music|#}}||E{{Music|#}}||F{{Music|doublesharp}}
|-
|}

Even when enharmonic equivalence is not resorted to, it is more common to use either no key signature or one with single-sharps and to provide accidentals as needed for the F{{music|doublesharp}}s, than to incorporate double-sharps into the key signature. Nevertheless, examples of the latter can be found (see below).

==Enharmonic equivalence==
[[Image:Circle of fifths deluxe 4.svg|thumb|Circle of fifths showing major and minor keys]]
While a piece of Western music generally has a [[Tonic (music)|home key]], a passage within it may [[modulate (music)|modulate]] to another key, which is usually [[closely related key|closely related]] to the home key (in the Baroque and early Classical eras), that is, close to the original around the [[circle of fifths]]. When the key is near the top of the circle (a key signature of zero or few accidentals), the notation of both keys is straightforward.  But if the home key is near the bottom of the circle (a key signature of many accidentals), and particularly if the new key is on the opposite side (in the late Classical and Romantic eras), it becomes necessary to consider enharmonic equivalence (if double accidentals are to be avoided).

In each of the bottom three places on the circle of fifths the two enharmonic equivalents can be notated entirely with single accidentals and so do not classify as 'theoretical keys':
{| class="wikitable"
!Major (minor) || Key signature || &amp;nbsp; || Major (minor) || Key signature
|-
|[[B major|B]] ([[G-sharp minor|g{{Music|sharp}}]]) || 5 [[sharp (music)|sharps]] || &amp;nbsp; || [[C-flat major|C{{Music|flat}}]] ([[A-flat minor|a{{Music|flat}}]]) || 7 [[flat (music)|flats]]
|-
|[[F-sharp major|F{{Music|sharp}}]] ([[D-sharp minor|d{{Music|sharp}}]]) || 6 sharps || &amp;nbsp; || [[G-flat major|G{{Music|flat}}]] ([[E-flat minor|e{{Music|flat}}]]) || 6 flats
|-
|[[C-sharp major|C{{Music|sharp}}]] [[A-sharp minor|(a{{Music|sharp}}]]) || 7 sharps || &amp;nbsp; || [[D-flat major|D{{Music|flat}}]] ([[B-flat minor|b{{Music|flat}}]]) || 5 flats
|}

==The need to consider theoretical keys==
However, when a parallel key ascends the opposite side of the circle from its home key, then theory suggests that double-sharps and double-flats would have to be incorporated into the notated key signature. The following keys (six of which are the [[parallel key|parallel]] major/minor keys of those above) would require up to seven double-sharps or double-flats: 

:{| class="wikitable"
!Key||Key signature||[[Relative key]]
|-
|[[D-flat minor|D{{Music|flat}} minor]] ([[C-sharp minor|C{{Music|sharp}} minor]])|| 8 flats || [[F-flat major|F{{Music|flat}} major]] ([[E major]])
|-
|G{{Music|flat}} minor ([[F-sharp minor|F{{Music|sharp}} minor]])|| 9 flats || B{{Music|doubleflat}} major ([[A major]])
|-
|C{{Music|flat}} minor ([[B minor]])|| 10 flats || E{{Music|doubleflat}} major ([[D major]])
|-
|F{{Music|flat}} minor ([[E minor]])|| 11 flats || A{{Music|doubleflat}} major ([[G major]])
|-
|B{{Music|doubleflat}} minor ([[A minor]])|| 12 flats || D{{Music|doubleflat}} major ([[C major]])
|-
|E{{Music|doubleflat}} minor ([[D minor]])|| 13 flats || G{{Music|doubleflat}} major ([[F major]])
|-
|A{{Music|doubleflat}} minor ([[G minor]])|| 14 flats || C{{Music|doubleflat}} major ([[B-flat major|B{{Music|flat}} major]])
|-
|[[G-sharp major|G{{Music|sharp}} major]] ([[A-flat major|A{{Music|flat}} major]])|| 8 sharps || E{{Music|sharp}} minor ([[F minor]]) 
|-
|D{{Music|sharp}} major ([[E-flat major|E{{Music|flat}} major]])|| 9 sharps || B{{Music|sharp}} minor ([[C minor]])

|-
|B{{Music|sharp}} major ([[C major]])|| 12 sharps || G{{Music|doublesharp}} minor ([[A minor]])
|-
|F{{Music|doublesharp}} major ([[G major]])|| 13 sharps || D{{Music|doublesharp}} minor ([[E minor]])
|-
|C{{Music|doublesharp}} major ([[D major]])|| 14 sharps || A{{Music|doublesharp}} minor ([[B minor]])
|}
For example, pieces in the major mode commonly modulate up a [[perfect fifth|fifth]] to the [[dominant (music)|dominant]]; for a key with sharps in the signature this leads to a key whose key signature has an additional sharp. A piece in C{{Music|#}} that performs this modulation would lead to the theoretical key of G{{Music|#}} major, requiring eight sharps, meaning an F{{Music|x}} in place of the F{{Music|#}} already present. To write that passage with a new key signature would require recasting the new section using the enharmonically equivalent key signature of A{{Music|b}} major. An example of such recasting is [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[Suite bergamasque]]'': in the third movement "Clair de lune" the key shifts for a few measures from D{{music|b}} major to D{{music|b}} minor (eight flats), but the passage is notated in C{{music|#}} minor (four sharps) for ease of reading; the same happens in the final movement "Passepied", which reaches theoretical G{{Music|sharp}} major written as A{{Music|flat}} major.

However, such passages may instead be notated with the use of double-sharp or double-flat accidentals, as in this example from [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', in G{{music|#}} major (the overall key is C{{music|#}} major):

:[[File:G-sharp major example 2.png]]

In very few cases, theoretical keys are in fact used directly, putting the necessary double-accidentals in the key signature. The final pages of [[John Foulds]]' ''[[A World Requiem]]'' are written in G{{music|sharp}} major (with F{{music|x}} in the key signature), and the third movement of [[Victor Ewald]]'s Brass Quintet Op. 8 is written in F{{music|flat}} major (with B{{music|bb}} in the key signature).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enspub.com/pages/sku93503.htm |title=Ewald: Quintet No 4 in A{{music|b}}, op 8 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Ensemble Publications |publisher=Ensemble Publications |access-date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tunings other than twelve-tone equal-temperament==

In a different [[tuning system]] (for example, [[19 equal temperament|19 tone equal temperament]]), several keys do require a double-sharp or double-flat in the key signature, and no longer have conventional equivalents: where there are 19 tones in the scale, the key of B{{Music|doubleflat}} major (9 flats) is equivalent to A{{Music|sharp}} major (10 sharps). In [[17 equal temperament|17 tone equal temperament]] and [[31 equal temperament|31 tone equal temperament]], keys that are enharmonic in a 12 tone system (for example, A♭ and G♯ major) may have to be notated completely differently.

[[File:Retiarius vs secutor from Borghese mosaic.jpg|thumb|[[Retiarius]] vs [[Secutor]], the two gladiators lying are dead, as signified by the ''theta nigrum'']]
The '''theta nigrum''' ("black [[theta]]") or '''theta infelix''' ("unlucky theta") is a [[Symbols of death|symbol of death]] in Greek and Latin [[epigraphy]].&lt;ref name="Mednik"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mednikarova  |first=Iveta |last2= |first2= |date= |title=The Use of Θ in Latin Funerary Inscriptions |url= |journal=Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik|volume=136 |issue=|pages=267–276 |doi= |access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isidore of Seville]] notes the letter was appended after the name of a deceased soldier and finds of [[papyrus|papyri]] containing military records have confirmed this use.&lt;ref name="Mednik" /&gt; Additionally it can be seen in [[Gladiator Mosaic|The Gladiator Mosaic]]. 

The term ''theta nigrum'' was coined by [[Theodor Mommsen]], but

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29714">This is a timeline of the [[feminist art movement]] in [[New Zealand]] (or Aotearoa/New Zealand as it is often known in inclusive circles). It lists important figures, collectives, publications, exhibitions and moments that have contributed to discussion and development of the movement. For the indigenous [[Māori people|Māori]] population, the emergence of the [[feminist art movement]] broadly coincided with the emergence of [[Māori Renaissance]].

'''1982'''

The [[F1 Sculpture Project]] is staged in a large disused factory building on Tory Street in Wellington. A significant number of female artists make temporary installation pieces and a range of events were staged, including a two-day Women Sculptors Seminar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Factory 1 (F1) Sculpture Project 1982|url=http://thecommunityarchive.org.nz/node/65922/description|website=The Community Archive|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strathdee|first1=Barbara|title=Women Artists at the F1 New Zealand Sculpture Project|journal=Art New Zealand|date=Autumn 1983|issue=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1983'''

The national art magazine ''Art New Zealand'' dedicates its Autumn issue to female artists and the women's art movement. Art historian [[Cheryll Sotheran]] writes an overview of the current state and reception of women's art in New Zealand, noting  that 'most critics in New Zealand avoid or condemn exhibitions of women's art which use gender difference as a political weapon. The women whose art receives favourable reviews (or in many cases any reviews at all) are those whose work fits the modernist mould, are not feminists, are asexual and apolitical.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sotheran|first1=Cheryll|title=Replacing Women in Art History|url=http://www.art-newzealand.com/Issues21to30/replacing.htm|website=Art New Zealand|accessdate=21 February 2016|date=Autumn 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, [[Gretchen Albrecht]] selects work for a group exhibition arranged by the Outreach Gallery in Auckland,  ''New Works By Women''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosier|first1=Pat|title=New Works By Women, 1983|journal=Broadsheet|date=June 1983|issue=110|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, Juliet Batten facilitates ''The Menstrual Maze'' at Greer's Factory in Auckland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first1=Bronwen|title=The Menstrual Maze|journal=Broadsheet|date=September 1983|issue=112|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The June issue of feminist magazine ''Broadsheet'' includes a special feature on feminist artists. It includes Batten's article 'What is a feminist artist?'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Batten|first1=Juliet|title=What is a feminist artist?|journal=Broadsheet|date=June 1983|issue=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broadsheet 110, June 1983: 'Special feature on feminist art'|url=http://best-of-3.blogspot.co.nz/2016/03/broadsheet-110-june-1983-special.html|website=Best of 3|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1986'''

The journal ''Antic'' is launched. Art historian [[Tina Barton]] describes it as 'one forum for a more analytical explication of feminist theory and its applications in the field of literature, criticism and the visual arts, which could be seen as an alternative to the ''Broadsheet'' or ''Art New Zealand'' models.' It ceases publication in 1990.&lt;ref name ='Barton 1993'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barton|first1=Christina|title=Ten Years On: Reviewing the terrain for women in art in New Zealand|journal=Art New Zealand|date=Spring 1993|issue=68|pages=50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antic 1986 - 1990: full list of contents|url=http://best-of-3.blogspot.co.nz/2016/03/antic-1986-1990-full-list-of-contents.html|website=Best of 3|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art critic Lita Barrie delivers a paper, 'Remissions: toward a deconstruction of phallic unequivocality: deferrals', at the Critic's Conference at the National Art Gallery. Informed by contemporary French theory and calling for a 'critical feminist art practice', Barrie attacked the essentialist form of feminist art practice common at the time, sending 'shock waves through the community of women artists to whom her paper was addressed'.&lt;ref name = 'Barton 1993'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rice|first1=Rebecca|last2=Williams|first2=Mark|title=Criticism and the arts - Issues of identity, 1960s onwards|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/criticism-and-the-arts/page-4|website=Te Ara - The Online Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Basal cells ===
The basal layer of the epithelium is the most mitotically active and reproduces new cells.&lt;ref name="Blaustein2002" /&gt; This layer is composed of one layer of cuboidal cells laying on top of the basal membrane.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Parabasal cells ===
The parabasal cells include the stratum granulousum and the stratum spinosum.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In these two layers, cells from the lower basal layer transition from active metabolic activity to death (apoptosis). In these mid-layers of the epithelia, the cells begin to lose their [[mitochondria]] and other cell organelles.&lt;ref name="Blaustein2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reproductive and developmental toxicology|last=Gupta|first=Ramesh| name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Academic Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-12-382032-7|location=London|pages=1005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The multiple layers of parabasal cells are polyhedral in shape with prominent nuclei.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Intermediate cells ===
Intermediate cells make abundant glycogen and store it.&lt;ref name="Wehrend17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; [[Estrogen]] induces the intermediate and superficial cells to fill with [[glycogen]].&lt;ref name="Robboy" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nunn KL, Forney LJ | title = Unraveling the Dynamics of the Human Vaginal Microbiome | journal = The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 331–337 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27698617 | pmc = 5045142 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The intermediate cells contain nuclei and are larger than the parabasal cells and more flattened. Some have identified a transitional layer of cells above intermediate layer&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Superficial cells ===
[[Estrogen]] induces the intermediate and superficial cells to fill with [[glycogen]].&lt;ref name="Robboy" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Several layers of superficial cells exist that consist large, flattened cells with indistinct nuclei. The superficial cells are exfoliated continuously.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Cell junctions ===
The junctions between epithelial cells regulate the passage of molecules, bacteria and viruses by functioning as a physical barrier.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; The three types of structural adhesions between epithelial cells are: tight junctions, [[adherens junction]]s, and [[desmosome]]s. "Tight junctions ([[Tight junction|zonula occludens]]) are composed of [[transmembrane protein]]s that make contact across the intercellular space and create a seal to restrict [[transmembrane proteins]] difusion.&lt;ref name="Beckmann" /&gt; of molecules across the epithelial sheet. Tight junctions also have an organizing role in epithelial polarization by limiting the mobility of membrane-bound molecules between the apical and basolateral domains of the plasma membrane of each epithelial cell.

=== Mucous ===
The vagina itself does not contain [[mucous gland]]s.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nunn KL, Wang YY, Harit D, Humphrys MS, Ma B, Cone R, Ravel J, Lai SK | title = Enhanced Trapping of HIV-1 by Human Cervicovaginal Mucus Is Associated with Lactobacillus crispatus-Dominant Microbiota | journal = mBio | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = e01084-15 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26443453 | pmc = 4611035 | doi = 10.1128/mBio.01084-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though [[Mucus|mucous]] is not produced by the vaginal epithelium, mucous originates from the cervix.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The cervical mucous that is located inside the vagina can be used to assess fertility in ovulating women.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nfp.marquette.edu/nfp_quick_inst_mucus.php|title=NFP Quick Instructions for the Marquette Model (Mucus Only)|last=|first=|date=2018|website=|publisher=Marquette University|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bartholin's glands]] and [[Skene's gland]]s located at the entrance of the vagina do produce mucous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3s_s6-G3hVwC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=%22vaginal+mucus%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HwRyOODJko&amp;sig=VcBNgAYdW88nlyrVH-ldz8tnlkw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzk8313qzZAhVDZKwKHTVvBGA4FBDoAQgoMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22vaginal%20mucus%22&amp;f=false|title=Sperm Competition in Humans: Classic and Contemporary Readings|last=Shackelford|first=Todd K.|last2=Pound|first2=Nicholas| name-list-format = vanc |date=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780387280363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The epithelium of the vagina originates from three different precursors during embryonic and [[Prenatal development|fetal development]]. These are the vaginal squamous epithelium of the lower vagina, the columnar epithelium of the [[Cervical canal|endocervix]], and the squamous epithelium of the upper vagina. The distinct origins of vaginal epithelium may impact the understanding of [[vaginal anomalies]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reich O, Fritsch H | title = The developmental origin of cervical and vaginal epithelium and their clinical consequences: a systematic review | journal = Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 358–60 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 24977630 | doi = 10.1097/lgt.0000000000000023 | url = http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00128360-201410000-00016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Vaginal adenosis]] is a vaginal anomaly traced to displacement of normal vaginal tissue by other reproductive tissue within the muscular layer and epithelium of the vaginal wall. This displaced tissue often contains glandular tissue and appears as a raised, red surface.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BbJjfMjDM7cC&amp;pg=PA1388&amp;dq=vagina+epithelium&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig-PaBk5DZAhUkpFkKHaMIB4MQ6AEIUzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=vagina%20epithelium&amp;f=false|title=The 5-Minute Clinical Consult 2011|last=Domino|first=Frank J.| name-list-format = vanc |date=2010|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=9781608312597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cyclic variations ==
During the luteal and follicular phases of the estrous cycle the structure of the vaginal epithelium varies. The number of cell layers vary during the days of the estrous cycle:

Day 10, 22 layers

Days 12-14, 46 layers

Day 19,  32 layers

Day 24, 24 layers

The glycogen levels in the cells is at its highest immediately before ovulation.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==Lytic cells==
[[File:Vagina (mucosa).JPG|thumb|Different layers of the vaginal epithelium]]

Without estrogen, the vaginal epithelium is only a few layers thick. Only small round cells are seen that originate directly from the basal layer ([[Stratum basale|basal cells]]) or the cell layers (parabasal cells) above it. The parabasal cells, which are slightly larger than the basal cells, form a five- to ten-layer cell layer.  The parabasal cells can also differentiate into [[histiocyte]]s or glandular cells. Estrogen also influences the changing ratios of nuclear constituents to cytoplasm. As a result of cell aging, cells with shrunken, seemingly foamy cell nuclei (intermediary cells ) develop from the parabasal cells. These can be categorized by means of the nuclear-plasma relation into "upper" and "deep" intermediate cells.&lt;ref name="Knörr" /&gt; Intermediate cells make abundant glycogen and store it. The further nuclear shrinkage and formation of [[mucopolysaccharides]] are distinct characteristics of superficial cells. The mucopolysaccharides form a [[keratin]]-like cell scaffold. Fully keratinized cells without a nucleus are called 'floes'.&lt;ref name="Nauth23"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Hans Friedrich | last1 = Nauth | name-list-format = vanc | title = Gynäkologische Zytodiagnostik|edition = 2nd |publisher = Georg Thieme|location = Stuttgart|year=2014| page = 23 |isbn=978-3-13-131092-7|language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wehrend17"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Axel | last1 = Wehrend | name-list-format = vanc | title=Leitsymptome Gynäkologie und Geburtshilfe beim Hund|publisher=Enke|location = Stuttgart|year = 2010| page = 17|isbn=978-3-8304-1076-8 | language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intermediate and superficial cells are constantly exfoliated from the epithelium. The glycogen from these cells is converted to sugars and then fermented by the bacteria of the vaginal flora to lactic acid.&lt;ref name="Nauth23" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; The cells progress through the cell cycle and then decompose (cytolysis) within a week's time. Cytolysis occurs only in the presence of glycogen-containing cells, that is, when the epithelium is degraded to the upper intermediate cells and superficial cells. In this way, the cytoplasm is dissolved, while the cell nuclei remain.&lt;ref name="Nauth23" /&gt;

== Epithelial microbiota==
[[File:Glycogen structure.svg |thumb|Glycogen is the complex form of sugar present in the vaginal epithelium that is metabolized into lactic acid]]

Low pH is necessary to control vaginal microbiota. Vaginal epithelial cells have a relatively high concentration of glycogen compared to other epithelial cells of the human body. The metabolism of this complex sugar by the lactobacillus dominated microbiome is responsible for vaginal acidity.&lt;ref name=" Aroutcheva "&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Aroutcheva A. |author2=Gariti D. |author3=Simon M. |author4=Shott S. |author5=Faro J. |author6=Simoes J.

== Function ==
The [[Cell junction|cellular junctions]] of the vaginal epithelium help prevent pathogenic microorganisms from entering the body though some are still able to penetrate this barrier. Cells of the cervix and vaginal epithelium generate a [[Mucus|mucous]] barrier (glycocalyx) in which immune cells reside. In addition, [[white blood cell]]s provide additional immunity and are able to infiltrate and move through the vaginal epithelium.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The epithelium is permeable to antibodies, other immune system cells, and [[macromolecule]]s. The permeability of epithelium thus provides access for these immune system components to prevent the passage of invading pathogens into deeper vaginal tissue.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; The epithelium further provides a barrier to microbes the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides ([[Beta defensin|beta-defensins]] and [[cathelicidin]]s) and immunoglobulins.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Terminally differentiated, superficial keratinocytes extrude the contents of [[lamellar bodies]] out of the cell to form a specialized, intercellular [[lipid]] envelope that encases the cells of the epidermis and provides a physical barrier to microorganisms.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Clinical significance==
[[File:Chlamydia pneumoniae.jpg|thumb|Vaginal epithelial cells containing chlamydia bacteria]]

=== Disease transmission ===
Sexually transmitted infections, including HIV are rarely transmitted across intact and healthy epithelium. These protective mechanisms are due to: frequent exfoliation of the superficial cells, low pH, and innate and acquired immunity in the tissue. Research into the protective nature of the vaginal epithelium has been recommended as it would help in the design of [[topical medication]] and microbicides.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;

=== Cancer ===

=== Atrophy ===
The vaginal epithelium changes significantly when estrogen levels decrease at menopause.&lt;ref&gt;''Vulvovaginal atrophy'' and ''atrophic vaginitis'' have been the preferred terms for this condition and cluster of symptoms until recently. These terms are now regarded as inaccurate in describing changes to the whole genitourinary system occurring after menopause. The term ''atrophic vaginitis'' suggests that the vaginal is inflamed or infected. Though this may be true, inflammation and infection are not the major components of postmenopausal changes to the vagina after menopause. The former terms do not describe the negative effects on the lower urinary tract which can be the most troubling symptoms of menopause for women.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atrophic vaginitis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim HK, Kang SY, Chung YJ, Kim JH, Kim MR | title = The Recent Review of the Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause | language = English | journal = Journal of Menopausal Medicine | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 65–71 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26357643 | doi = 10.6118/jmm.2015.21.2.65 | url = https://synapse.koreamed.org/DOIx.php?id=10.6118/jmm.2015.21.2.65 }}&lt;/ref&gt; usually causes scant odorless discharge with no odor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Faubion SS, Sood R, Kapoor E | title = Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause: Management Strategies for the Clinician | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 92 | issue = 12 | pages = 1842–1849 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 29202940 | doi = 10.1016/j.mayocp.2017.08.019 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0025619617306390 | via =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2184">'''William Zeitlin''' (c. 1850 – 1921, in [[Leipzig]]) was a Russian scholar and bibliographer born at [[Homel]], government (''[[guberniya]]'') of [[Moghilef]], about the middle of the 19th century. He is known especially as the author of ''Kiryat Sefer,'' or ''Bibliotheca Hebraica Post-Mendelssohniana'' (Leipzig, 1891–95), a bibliographical dictionary of modern [[Hebrew literature]] from the beginning of [[Moses Mendelssohn]]'s epoch until 1890. The compilation of this work occupied Zeitlin for twenty years. He made extensive use of [[Benjacob]]'s ''Otzar ha-Sefarim'' and of [[Julius Fürst|Fürst]]'s ''Bibliotheca Judaica'', and visited [[Vilna]] and [[Warsaw]], the centers of the Hebrew book market, as well as many university cities—as [[Königsberg]], [[Berlin]], [[Geneva]], and [[Paris]]—from the libraries of which he gathered additional material for his work.

The ''Qiryat Sefer'' indexes not only works in book form, but also important periodical articles, biographical sketches, and scientific essays, in addition to giving biographical notes on several authors. Zeitlin had previously prepared an index of works written on the [[Hebrew calendar]], in which he enumerates seventy-seven Hebrew works; this index was published by [[Chayyim Jonah Gurland]] in ''Yevreiski Kalendar'' (St. Petersburg, 1882). In the ''Zeit. für Hebr. Bibl.'' (ix.3-4) Zeitlin has published an alphabetical list of anagrams and pseudonyms of modern Hebrew writers; he was also a contributor to several Hebrew periodicals, writing mostly biographical articles.
