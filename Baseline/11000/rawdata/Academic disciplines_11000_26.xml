'''Advanced Placement [[Chemistry]]''' ('''AP Chemistry''' or '''AP Chem''') is a course and examination offered by the [[College Board]] as a part of the [[Advanced Placement Program]] to give [[United States|American]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] high school students the opportunity to demonstrate their abilities and earn [[college]]-level credit. AP Chemistry has the distinction of having the lowest known test participation rate, with 49.5% of AP Chemistry students taking the exam in one study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|title=Research on the academic benefits of the Advanced Placement program: Taking stock and looking forward |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177%2F2158244016682996 |journal=SAGE Open|date=2017|volume=7|issue=1|page=9|doi=10.1177/2158244016682996|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another, smaller study found that 52.7% of students enrolled in AP Chemistry took their course's AP test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sadler|first1=Philip M.|last2=Sonnert|first2=Gerhard|last3=Hazari|first3=Zahra|last4=Tai|first4=Robert|title=The role of Advanced high school coursework in increasing STEM career interest|journal=Science Educator|volume=23|issue=1|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The course==
AP Chemistry is a course geared toward students with interests in chemical and [[physical science]]s, as well as any of the biological sciences. The course aims to prepare students to take the AP Chemistry exam toward the end of the academic year. AP Chemistry topics include [[atomic theory]], [[chemical bonding]], [[phases of matter]], [[solution (chemistry)|solutions]], [[chemical reactions|types of reactions]], [[chemical equilibrium]], [[reaction kinetics]], [[electrochemistry]], and [[thermodynamics]].

==Prerequisites==
The College Board recommends successful completion of High School Chemistry and [[Algebra II]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/sub_chem.html AP Chemistry at collegeboard.com]&lt;/ref&gt; however, requirement of this may differ from school to school. AP Chemistry usually requires knowledge of [[Algebra II]]; however, some schools allow students to take Algebra II concurrently with this class. The requirement of regular or honors level High School Chemistry may also be waived, but usually requires completion of a special assignment or exam.

==The exam==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2015}}

The annual AP Chemistry examination, which is typically administered in May, is divided into two major sections (multiple-choice questions and free response essays).

=== Old test (2013 and earlier) ===

The old test was composed of two sections: a multiple-choice section consisting of 75 questions with five answer choices each, and a free-response section consisting of six essay prompts that required the authoring of chemical equations, solution of problems, and development of thoughtful essays in response to [[hypothetical]] scenarios.

* '''Section I''', the multiple-choice portion, did ''not'' allow the use of a [[calculator]], nor did it provide any additional reference material, other than a periodic table. Each question contained five answer choices. 90 minutes were allotted for the completion of Section I. Section I covered the breadth of the curriculum.
* '''Section II''', the free response section, was divided into two sections: Part A, requiring the completion of three problems, and Part B, also containing three problems.  Part A, lasting 55 minutes, allowed the use of calculators, while Part B, lasting 40 minutes, did not. The first problem in Part A concerned equilibrium related to solubility, [[acids]] and [[base (chemistry)|bases]], or pressure/concentration.  The first question of Part B was a chemical equation question in which 3 scenarios were presented and the student was required to work all 3 scenarios, authoring a balanced net ionic chemical equation for each scenario and answering questions about the equations and scenarios. If time permitted, students may have edited their responses from Part A during the time allotted for responding to Part B, though without the use of a calculator. The student needed to have completed all six questions.

While the use of calculators was prohibited during Section I and Section II Part B, a periodic table, a list of selected standard reduction potentials, and two pages of equations and conventions are available for use during the entirety of Section II.

=== New test (2014 and later) ===
{{expand section|date=February 2015}}

The 2014 AP Chemistry exam was the first administration of a redesigned test as a result of a redesigning of the AP Chemistry course.  The exam format is now different from the previous years, with 60 multiple choice questions (now with only four answer choices per question), 3 long free response questions, and 4 short free response questions. The new exam has a focus on longer, more in depth, lab-based questions. The penalty for incorrect answers on the multiple choice section was also removed.  More detailed information can be found at the related link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exam Content|url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/exam/exam_information/1998.html|work=The AP Chemistry Exam|publisher=The College Board|accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology |theories}}

The '''alliance theory''', also known as the '''general theory of exchanges''', is a [[Structuralism|structuralist]] method of studying [[kinship]] relations. It finds its origins in [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s ''Elementary Structures of Kinship'' (1949) and is in opposition to the [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] theory of [[Radcliffe-Brown]]. Alliance theory has oriented most [[Anthropology|anthropological]] French works until the 1980s; its influences were felt in various fields, including [[psychoanalysis]]&lt;!-- (who shared the belief in a universal [[incest taboo]])--&gt;, [[philosophy]] and [[political philosophy]].

The hypothesis of a "marriage-alliance" emerged in this frame, pointing out towards the necessary interdependence of various families and lineages. Marriages themselves are thus seen as a form of [[communication]] that anthropologists such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]], [[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]] or [[Rodney Needham]] have described. Alliance theory hence tries to understand the basic questions about inter-individual relations, or what constitutes [[human society|society]].

Alliance theory is based on the [[incest taboo]]: according to it, only this [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] prohibition of incest pushes human groups towards [[exogamy]]. Thus, inside a given society, certain categories of kin are forbidden to inter-marry. The incest taboo is thus a negative prescription; without it, nothing would push men to go searching for women outside their inner kinship circle, or vice versa. This theory echoes with [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'' (1913). But the incest taboo of alliance theory, in which one's daughter or sister is offered to someone outside a family circle, starts a circle of exchange of women: in return, the giver is entitled to a woman from the other's intimate kinship group. Thus the negative prescriptions of the prohibition have positive counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], ''Les structures élémentaires de la parenté'', Paris, Mouton, 1967, 2ème édition, p.60''&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the alliance theory is thus of a reciprocal or a generalized exchange which founds [[Affinity (law)|affinity]]. This global phenomenon takes the form of a "circulation of women" which links together the various social groups in one whole: society.

== Elementary structures and complex structures ==

According to Lévi-Strauss's alliance theory, there are two different structural "models" of marriage exchange. Either the women of ego's group are offered to another group "explicitly defined" by social institutions: these are the "elementary structures of kinship". Or the group of possible spouses for the women in ego's group is "indetermined and always open", to the exclusion, however, of certain kin-people ([[nuclear family]], aunts, uncles...), as in the [[Western world]]. Lévi-Strauss call these latter "complex structures of kinship".

Levi-Strauss' model attempted to offer a single explanation for [[Parallel and cross cousins|cross-cousin]] marriage, sister-exchange, dual organisation and rules of [[exogamy]]. Marriage rules over time create social structures, as marriages are primarily forged between groups and not just between the two individuals involved. When groups exchange women on a regular basis they marry together, with each marriage creating a debtor/creditor relationship which must be balanced through the "repayment" of wives, either directly or in the next generation. Levi-Strauss proposed that the initial motivation for the exchange of women was the incest taboo, which he deemed to be the beginning and essence of culture, as it was the first rule to check natural impulses; and secondarily the sexual division of labour. The former, by prescribing exogamy, creates a distinction between marriageable and tabooed women and thus necessitates a search for women outside one's own kin group ("marry out or die out"), which fosters exchange relationships with other groups; the latter creates a need for women to do "women's tasks". By necessitating wife-exchange arrangements, exogamy therefore promotes inter-group alliances and serves to form structures of social networks.

Levi-Strauss also discovered that a wide range of historically unrelated cultures had the rule that individuals should marry their cross-cousin, meaning children of siblings of the opposite sex - from a male perspective that is either the FZD (father's sister's daughter in kinship abbreviation) or the MBD (mother's brother's daughter in kinship abbreviation). Accordingly, he grouped all possible kinship systems into a scheme containing three basic kinship structures, constructed out of two types of exchange. He called the three kinship structures elementary, semi-complex and complex.

Elementary structures are based on positive marriage rules that specify whom a person must marry, while complex systems specify negative marriage rules (whom one must not marry), thus leaving a certain amount of room for choice based on preference. Elementary structures can operate based on two forms of exchange: restricted (or direct) exchange, a symmetric form of exchange between two groups (also called moieties) of wife-givers and wife-takers; in an initial restricted exchange FZ marries MB, with all children then being bilateral cross-cousins (the daughter is both MBD and FZD). Continued restricted exchange means that the two lineages marry together. Restricted exchange structures are generally quite uncommon.

The second form of exchange within elementary structures is called generalised exchange, meaning that a man can only marry either his MBD ([[matrilateral]] cross-cousin marriage) or his FZD ([[patrilateral]] cross-cousin marriage). This involves an asymmetric exchange between at least three groups. Matrilateral cross-cousin marriage arrangements where the marriage of the parents is repeated by successive generations are very common in parts of Asia (e.g. amongst the [[Jingpo people|Kachin]]). Levi-Strauss considered generalised exchange to be superior to restricted exchange because it allows the integration of indefinite numbers of groups.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Barnard and Good, 1984:96&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of restricted exchange are found in some tribes residing in the [[Amazon basin]]. These tribal societies are made up of multiple moieties which often split up, thus rendering them comparatively unstable. Generalised exchange is more integrative but contains an implicit hierarchy, for instance amongst the Kachin where wife-givers are superior to wife-takers. Consequently, the last wife-taking group in the chain is significantly inferior to the first wife-giving group to which it is supposed to give its wives. These status inequalities can destabilise the entire system or can at least lead to an accumulation of wives (and in the case of the Kachin also of bridewealth) at one end of the chain.

From a structural perspective, matrilateral cross-cousin marriage is superior to its patrilateral counterpart; the latter has less potential to produce social cohesion since its exchange cycles are shorter (the direction of wife exchange is reversed in each successive generation). Levi-Strauss' theory is supported by fact that patrilateral cross-cousin marriage is in fact the rarest of three types. However, matrilateral generalised exchange poses a risk, as group A depends on being given a woman from a group that it has not itself given a woman to, meaning that there is a less immediate obligation to reciprocate compared to a restricted exchange system. The risk created by such a delayed return is obviously lowest in restricted exchange systems.

Levi-Strauss proposed a third structure between elementary and complex structures, called the semi-complex structure, or the Crow-Omaha system. Semi-complex structures contain so many negative marriage rules that they effectively come close to prescribing marriage to certain parties, thus somewhat resembling elementary structures. These structures are found amongst societies such as the [[Crow tribe|Crow]] and [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]] native [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] in [[North America]].

In Levi-Strauss' order of things, the basic building block of kinship is not just the nuclear family, as in structural-functionalism, but the so-called kinship atom: the nuclear family together with the wife's brother. This "mother's brother" (from the perspective of the wife-seeking son) plays a crucial role in alliance theory, as he is the one who ultimately decides whom his daughter will marry. Moreover, it is not just the nuclear family as such but alliances between families that matter in regard to the creation of social structures, reflecting the typical structuralist argument that the position of an element in the structure is more significant than the element itself. Descent theory and alliance theory therefore look at two different sides of the same coin: the former emphasising bonds of consanguinity (kinship by blood), the latter stressing bonds of affinity (kinship by law or choice).

'''Automotive suspension design''' is an aspect of [[automotive engineering]], concerned with designing the [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] for cars and trucks.  Suspension design for other vehicles is similar, though the process may not be as well established.

The process entails 

*Selecting appropriate vehicle level targets
*Selecting a system architecture
*Choosing the location of  the 'hard points', or theoretical centres of each [[ball joint]] or [[Bushing (isolator)|bushing]]
*Selecting the rates of the bushings
*Analysing the loads in the suspension
*Designing the [[spring rate]]s
*Designing [[shock absorber]] characteristics
*Designing the structure of each component so that it is strong, stiff, light, and cheap
*Analysing the [[vehicle dynamics]] of the resulting design

Since the 1990s the use of [[multibody]] simulation and [[finite element]] software has made this series of tasks more straightforward.

==Vehicle level targets==

A partial list would include:

*Maximum steady state lateral acceleration (in understeer mode)
*Roll stiffness (degrees per g of lateral acceleration)
*Ride frequencies  
*Lateral [[load transfer]] percentage distribution front to rear
*[[Roll moment]] distribution front to rear
*Ride heights at various states of load
*[[Understeer]] gradient
*[[Turning radius|Turning circle]]
*[[Ackermann steering geometry|Ackermann]]
*Jounce travel
*Rebound travel

Once the overall vehicle targets have been identified they can be used to set targets for the two suspensions. For instance, the overall understeer target can be broken down into contributions from each end using a [[Bundorf analysis]].

==System architecture==

Typically a vehicle designer is operating within a set of constraints. The suspension architecture selected for each end of the vehicle will have to obey those constraints. For both ends of the car this would include the type of spring, location of the spring, and location of the [[shock absorbers]]. 

For the front suspension the following need to be considered

*The type of suspension ([[MacPherson strut]] or [[double wishbone suspension]]) 
*Type of steering actuator ([[rack and pinion]] or [[recirculating ball]])
*Location of the steering actuator in front of, or behind, the wheel centre

For the rear suspension there are many more possible suspension types, in practice.

==Hardpoints==

The hardpoints control the static settings and the [[kinematics]] of the suspension. 

The static settings are

The kinematics describe how important characteristics change as the suspension moves, typically in roll or steer. They include

The analysis for these parameters can be done graphically, or by [[Computer-aided design|CAD]], or by the use of kinematics software.

==Compliance analysis==

The compliance of the bushings, the body, and other parts modify the behaviour of the suspension. In general it is difficult to improve the kinematics of a suspension using the bushings, but one example where it does work is the [[toe control]] bush used in [[Twist-beam rear suspension]]s. More generally, modern cars suspensions include a [[Noise, vibration, and harshness]] (NVH) bush. This is designed as the main path for the vibrations and forces that cause road noise and impact noise, and is supposed to be tunable without affecting the kinematics too much.

In racing cars, bushings tend to be made of harder materials for good handling such as [[brass]] or [[Polyoxymethylene|delrin]].
In Passenger cars, bushings tend to be made of softer material for added comfort.
In general physical terms, the [[mass]] and mechanical [[hysteresis]] (damping effect) of solid parts should be accounted for in a dynamic analysis, as well as their [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]].

==Loads==

Once the basic geometry is established the loads in each suspension part can be estimated. This can be as simple as deciding what a likely maximum load case is at the contact patch, and then drawing a [[Free body diagram]] of each part to work out the forces, or as complex as simulating the behaviour of the suspension over a rough road, and calculating the loads caused. Often loads that have been measured on a similar suspension are used instead - this is the most reliable method.

==Detailed design of arms==

The loads and geometry are then used to design the arms and spindle. Inevitably some problems will be found in the course of this that force compromises to be made with the basic geometry of the suspension.

In [[biology]], '''cell theory''' is the historic [[scientific theory]], now universally accepted, that living organisms are made up of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s, that they are the basic structural/organizational unit of all organisms, and that all cells come from pre-existing cells. Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction. With continual improvements made to [[microscope]]s over time, magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century. This discovery is largely attributed to [[Robert Hooke]], and began the scientific study of cells, also known as [[cell biology]]. Over a century later, many debates about cells began amongst scientists. Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration, and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life. Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839. This is usually credited to [[Matthias Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann]]. However, many other scientists like [[Rudolf Virchow]] contributed to the theory. It was an important step in the movement away from [[spontaneous generation]].

The three [[:wikt:tenet|tenet]]s to the cell theory are as described below:
# All living organisms are composed of one or more cells.
# The cell is the basic unit of structure and organization in organisms.
# Cells arise from pre-existing cells.

The first of these tenets is disputed, as [[non-cellular life|non-cellular entities]] such as viruses are sometimes considered life-forms.&lt;ref&gt;Villarreal, Luis P. (August 8, 2008) [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-viruses-alive-2004/ Are Viruses Alive?] ''Scientific American''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Microscopes==

[[File:Leeuwenhoek Microscope.png|thumb|Anton van Leeuwenhoek's microscope from the 17th century with a magnification of 300x.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.funsci.com/fun3_en/usph/usph.htm |title=A glass-sphere microscope |publisher=Funsci.com |accessdate=13 June 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100611200259/http://www.funsci.com/fun3_en/usph/usph.htm| archivedate= 11 June 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Hooke-microscope.png|thumb|Robert Hooke's microscope]]
The discovery of the cell was made possible through the invention of the microscope. In the first century BC, Romans were able to make glass, discovering that objects appeared to be larger under the [[glass]]. In Italy during the 12th century, Salvino D’Armate made a piece of glass fit over one eye, allowing for a magnification effect to that eye. The expanded use of lenses in [[eyeglasses]] in the 13th century probably led to wider spread use of [[Optical microscope#Simple microscope|simple microscope]]s ([[magnifying glass]]es) with limited magnification.&lt;ref&gt;Atti Della Fondazione Giorgio Ronchi E Contributi Dell'Istituto Nazionale Di Ottica, Volume 30, La Fondazione-1975, page 554&lt;/ref&gt; [[Optical microscope#Compound microscope|Compound microscope]], which combine an [[Objective (optics)|objective lens]] with an [[eyepiece]] to view a [[real image]] achieving much higher magnification, first appeared in Europe around 1620&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Albert Van Helden|author2=Sven Dupré|author3=Rob van Gent|title=The Origins of the Telescope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XguxYlYd-9EC&amp;pg=PA24|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-6984-615-6|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Rosenthal, Spectacles and Other Vision Aids: A History and Guide to Collecting, Norman Publishing, 1996, page 391 - 392&lt;/ref&gt; In 1665, Robert Hooke used a microscope about six inches long with two convex lenses inside and examined specimens under reflected light for the observations in his book ''[[Micrographia]]''. Hooke also used a simpler microscope with a single lens for examining specimens with directly transmitted light, because this allowed for a clearer image.&lt;ref name=Gest /&gt;

Extensive microscopic study was done by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], a draper who took the interest in microscopes after seeing one while on an apprenticeship in Amsterdam in 1648. At some point in his life before 1668, he was able to learn how to grind lenses.  This eventually led to Leeuwenhoek making his own unique microscope. His were a single lens simple microscope, rather than a [[compound microscope]]. This was because he was able to use a single lens that was a small glass sphere but allowed for a magnification of 270x. This was a large progression since the magnification before was only a maximum of 50x. After Leeuwenhoek, there was not much progress for the microscopes until the 1850s, two hundred years later. [[Carl Zeiss]], a German engineer who manufactured microscopes, began to make changes to the lenses used. But the optical quality did not improve until the 1880s when he hired [[Otto Schott]] and eventually [[Ernst Abbe]].&lt;ref name="Unifying Concept"/&gt;

Optical microscopes can focus on objects the size of a [[wavelength]] or larger, giving restrictions still to advancement in discoveries with objects smaller than the wavelengths of [[visible light]]. Later in the 1920s, the [[electron microscope]] was developed, making it possible to view objects that are smaller than optical wavelengths, once again, changing the possibilities in science.&lt;ref name="Unifying Concept" /&gt;

== Discovery of cells ==
[[File:Cork Micrographia Hooke.png|thumb|Drawing of the structure of [[Cork cambium|cork]] by [[Robert Hooke]] that appeared in ''[[Micrographia]]''.]]

The cell was first discovered by [[Robert Hooke]] in 1665, which can be found to be described in his book [[Micrographia]]. In this book, he gave 60 ‘observations’ in detail of various objects under a coarse, compound microscope.&lt;ref name=Gest&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One observation was from very thin slices of bottle cork. Hooke discovered a multitude of tiny pores that he named "cells". This came from the Latin word Cella, meaning ‘a small room’ like monks lived in and also Cellulae, which meant the six sided cell of a honeycomb. However, Hooke did not know their real structure or function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Inwood, Stephen |title=The man who knew too much: the strange and inventive life of Robert Hooke, 1635–1703 |publisher=Pan |location=London |year=2003 |page=72 |isbn=0-330-48829-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
What Hooke had thought were cells, were actually empty cell walls of plant tissues. With microscopes during this time having a low magnification, Hooke was unable to see that there were other internal components to the cells he was observing. Therefore, he did not think the "cellulae" were alive.&lt;ref name="Becker, Wayne M.; Kleinsmith, Lewis J. and Hardin, Jeff 2003 1"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Becker, Wayne M. |author2=Kleinsmith, Lewis J. |author3=Hardin, Jeff |page=1|title=The World of the Cell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UA8OAAAACAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-8053-4854-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His cell observations gave no indication of the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and other [[organelle]]s found in most living cells. In Micrographia, Hooke also observed mould, bluish in color, found on leather. After studying it under his microscope, he was unable to observe “seeds” that would have indicated how the mould was multiplying in quantity. This led to Hooke suggesting that spontaneous generation, from either natural or artificial heat, was the cause. Since this was an old [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotelian theory]] still accepted at the time, others did not reject it and was not disproved until [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek|Leeuwenhoek]] later discovers generation is achieved otherwise.&lt;ref name=Gest /&gt;

[[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] is another scientist who saw these cells soon after Hooke did. He made use of a microscope containing improved lenses that could magnify objects almost 300-fold, or 270x.&lt;ref name="Becker, Wayne M.; Kleinsmith, Lewis J. and Hardin, Jeff 2003 1"/&gt; Under these microscopes, Leeuwenhoek found motile objects. In a letter to [[The Royal Society]] on October 9, 1676, he states that [[motility]] is a quality of life therefore these were living organisms. Over time, he wrote many more papers in which described many specific forms of [[microorganisms]]. Leeuwenhoek named these “animalcules,” which included [[protozoa]] and other unicellular organisms, like [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name="Unifying Concept" /&gt; Though he did not have much formal education, he was able to identify the first accurate description of red blood cells and discovered bacteria after gaining interest in the sense of taste that resulted in Leeuwenhoek to observe the tongue of an ox, then leading him to study "pepper water" in 1676. He also found for the first time the [[sperm cells]] of animals and humans. Once discovering these types of cells, Leeuwenhoek saw that the fertilization process requires the sperm cell to enter the [[egg cell]]. This put an end to the previous theory of [[spontaneous generation]]. After reading letters by Leeuwenhoek, Hooke was the first to confirm his observations that were thought to be unlikely by other contemporaries.&lt;ref name=Gest /&gt;

The cells in animal tissues were observed after plants were because the [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] were so fragile and susceptible to tearing, it was difficult for such thin slices to be prepared for studying. Biologists believed that there was a fundamental unit to life, but were unsure what this was. It would not be until over a hundred years later that this fundamental unit was connected to cellular structure and existence of cells in animals or plants.&lt;ref name="History of Biology"&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Richard|title=History of Biology: Cell Theory and Cell Structure|url=http://www.biologyreference.com/Gr-Hi/History-of-Biology-Cell-Theory-and-Cell-Structure.html#b|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This conclusion was not made until [[Henri Dutrochet]]. Besides stating “the cell is the fundamental element of organization”,&lt;ref&gt;Dutrochet, Henri (1824) [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwQOAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA166,M1 "Recherches anatomiques et physiologiques sur la structure intime des animaux et des vegetaux, et sur leur motilite, par M.H. Dutrochet, avec deux planches"]&lt;/ref&gt; Dutrochet also claimed that cells were not just a structural unit, but also a physiological unit.

In 1804, [[Karl Rudolphi]] and [[Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link|J.H.F. Link]] were awarded the prize for "solving the problem of the nature of cells", meaning they were the first to prove that cells had independent [[cell walls]] by the [[University of Göttingen|Königliche Societät der Wissenschaft]] (Royal Society of Science), Göttingen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathnat.uni-rostock.de/geschichte/kalenderblatt/kalenderblatt-dezember-2013/ Kalenderblatt Dezember 2013 – Mathematisch-Naturwissenschaftliche Fakultät – Universität Rostock]. Mathnat.uni-rostock.de (2013-11-28). Retrieved on 2015-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Before, it had been thought that cells shared walls and the fluid passed between them this way.

[[File:Schwann Theodore.jpg|thumb|Schwann Theodore| [[Theodor Schwann]] (1810–1882)]]
Credit for developing cell theory is usually given to two scientists: [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharp |first=L. W. |year=1921 |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontocy032473mbp |title=Introduction To Cytology |location=New York |publisher=McGraw Hill Book Company Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Rudolf Virchow]] contributed to the theory, he is not as credited for his attributions toward it. In 1839, Schleiden suggested that every structural part of a plant was made up of cells or the result of cells. He also suggested that cells were made by a crystallization process either within other cells or from the outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schleiden, M. J. |year=1839|title= Beiträge zur Phytogenesis|journal=Archiv für Anatomie, Physiologie und wissenschaftliche Medicin|pages=137–176|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/49861#page/347/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was not an original idea of Schleiden. He claimed this theory as his own, though [[Barthelemy Charles Joseph Dumortier|Barthelemy Dumortier]] had stated it years before him. This crystallization process is no longer accepted with [[#Modern interpretation|modern cell theory]]. In 1839, [[Theodor Schwann]] states that along with plants, animals are composed of cells or the product of cells in their structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schwann, T. |year=1839|title=Mikroskopische Untersuchungen über die Uebereinstimmung in der Struktur und dem Wachsthum der Thiere und Pflanzen|publisher=Sander|place= Berlin|url=http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/book/show/schwann_mikroskopische_1839}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a major advancement in the field of biology since little was known about animal structure up to this point compared to plants. From these conclusions about plants and animals, two of the three tenets of cell theory were postulated.&lt;ref name="History of Biology" /&gt;

1. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells

2. The cell is the most basic unit of life

Schleiden's theory of free cell formation through crystallization was refuted in the 1850s by [[Robert Remak]], [[Rudolf Virchow]], and [[Albert Kolliker]].&lt;ref name="Unifying Concept"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1038/8964| pmid = 10559875| year = 1999| last1 = Mazzarello| first1 = P.| journal = Nature Cell Biology| volume = 1| issue = 1| url = http://newburyparkhighschool.net/barra/classes/bio_cp/handout_cell%20theory%20reading_students.doc| pages = E13–5| title = A unifying concept: the history of cell theory| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150603062810/http://newburyparkhighschool.net/barra/classes/bio_cp/handout_cell%20theory%20reading_students.doc| archivedate = 2015-06-03| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, Rudolf Virchow added the third tenet to cell theory. In Latin, this tenet states ''Omnis cellula e cellula''.&lt;ref name="History of Biology" /&gt;  This translated to:

3. All cells arise only from pre-existing cells

However, the idea that all cells come from pre-existing cells had in fact already been proposed by Robert Remak; it has been suggested that Virchow plagiarized Remak and did not give him credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silver|year=1987|title=Virchow, the heroic model in medicine: health policy by accolade|journal=[[American Journal of Public Health]]|volume=77|issue=1|pmid=3538915|pmc=1646803|doi=10.2105/AJPH.77.1.82|first1=GA|pages=82–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remak published observations in 1852 on cell division, claiming Schleiden and Schawnn were incorrect about generation schemes. He instead said that [[binary fission]], which was first introduced by Dumortier, was how reproduction of new animal cells were made. Once this tenet was added, the classical cell theory was complete.

== Modern interpretation ==
The generally accepted parts of modern cell theory include:

# All known living things are made up of one or more cells&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe&lt;/ref&gt;
# All living cells arise from pre-existing cells by division. 
# The cell is the fundamental unit of structure and function in all living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
# The activity of an organism depends on the total activity of independent cells.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
# Energy flow ([[metabolism]] and [[biochemistry]]) occurs within cells.&lt;ref name="modern Cell Theory" /&gt;
# Cells contain [[DNA]] which is found specifically in the chromosome and [[RNA]] found in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
# All cells are basically the same in chemical composition in organisms of similar species.&lt;ref name="modern Cell Theory" /&gt;

== Modern version ==
The modern version of the cell theory includes the ideas that:
*Energy flow occurs within cells.&lt;ref name="modern Cell Theory"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://biology.about.com/od/biologydictionary/g/celltheory.htm | title=The modern version of the Cell Theory | accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Heredity information ([[DNA]]) is passed on from cell to cell.&lt;ref name="modern Cell Theory" /&gt;
*All cells have the same basic chemical composition.&lt;ref name="modern Cell Theory" /&gt;

== Opposing concepts in cell theory: history and background ==

The cell was  first discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665 using a microscope. The first cell theory is credited to the work of [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] in the 1830s. In this theory the internal contents of cells were called [[protoplasm]] and described as a jelly-like substance, sometimes called living jelly. At about the same time, [[colloidal chemistry]] began its development, and the concepts of [[bound water]] emerged. A [[colloid]] being something between a [[solution]] and a [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]], where [[Brownian motion]] is sufficient to prevent [[sedimentation]].
The idea of a [[semipermeable membrane]], a barrier that is permeable to [[solvent]] but impermeable to solute [[molecules]] was developed at about the same time. The term [[osmosis]] originated in 1827 and its importance to [[physiological]] phenomena realized, but it wasn’t until 1877, when the [[botanist]] [[Pfeffer]] proposed the [[History of cell membrane theory|membrane theory]] of [[cell physiology]]. In this view, the cell was seen to be enclosed by a thin surface, the [[plasma membrane]], and cell water and solutes such as a [[potassium]] [[ion]] existed in a physical state like that of a [[dilute solution]]. In 1889 Hamburger used [[hemolysis]] of [[erythrocytes]] to determine the permeability of various solutes. By measuring the time required for the cells to swell past their elastic limit, the rate at which solutes entered the cells could be estimated by the accompanying change in cell volume. He also found that there was an apparent nonsolvent volume of about 50% in red blood cells and later showed that this includes water of hydration in addition to the protein and other nonsolvent components of the cells.

===Evolution of the membrane and bulk phase theories===

Two opposing concepts developed within the context of studies on [[osmosis]], permeability, and electrical properties of cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ling|first=Gilbert N.|title=In search of the physical basis of life|date=1984|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York|isbn=0306414090}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first held that these properties all belonged to the plasma membrane whereas the other predominant view was that the [[protoplasm]] was responsible for these properties.
The [[History of cell membrane theory|membrane theory]] developed as a succession of ad-hoc additions and changes to the theory to overcome experimental hurdles. Overton (a distant cousin of Charles Darwin) first proposed the concept of a lipid (oil) plasma membrane in 1899. The major weakness of the [[lipid membrane]] was the lack of an explanation of the high permeability to water, so Nathansohn (1904) proposed the mosaic theory. In this view, the membrane is not a pure lipid layer, but a mosaic of areas with lipid and areas with semipermeable gel. Ruhland refined the mosaic theory to include pores to allow additional passage of small molecules. Since membranes are generally less permeable to [[anions]], [[Leonor Michaelis]] concluded that [[ions]] are [[adsorbed]] to the walls of the pores, changing the permeability of the pores to ions by [[electrostatic repulsion]]. Michaelis demonstrated the [[membrane potential]] (1926) and proposed that it was related to the distribution of ions across the membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Michaelis|first1=L.|title=Contribution to the Theory of Permeability of Membranes for Electrolytes|journal=The Journal of General Physiology|volume=8|issue=2 |pages=33–59|year=1925|pmid=19872189|pmc=2140746|doi=10.1085/jgp.8.2.33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey and Danielli (1939) proposed a [[lipid bilayer]] membrane covered on each side with a layer of protein to account for measurements of surface tension. In 1941 Boyle &amp; Conway showed that the membrane of frog muscle was permeable to both {{chem|K|+}} and {{chem|Cl|-}}, but apparently not to {{chem|Na|+}}, so the idea of electrical charges in the pores was unnecessary since a single critical pore size would explain the permeability to {{chem|K|+}}, {{chem|H|+}}, and {{chem|Cl|-}} as well as the impermeability to {{chem|Na|+}}, {{chem|Ca|+}}, and {{chem|Mg|2+}}.
Over the same time period, it was shown (Procter &amp; Wilson, 1916) that gels, which do not have a semipermeable membrane, would swell in dilute solutions. [[Jacques Loeb|Loeb]] (1920) also studied [[gelatin]] extensively, with and without a membrane, showing that more of the properties attributed to the plasma membrane could be duplicated in [[gels]] without a membrane. In particular, he found that an electrical potential difference between the gelatin and the outside medium could be developed, based on the {{chem|H|+}} concentration. Some criticisms of the membrane theory developed in the 1930s, based on observations such as the ability of some cells to swell and increase their surface area by a factor of 1000. A lipid layer cannot stretch to that extent without becoming a patchwork (thereby losing its barrier properties. Such criticisms stimulated continued studies on protoplasm as the principal agent determining cell permeability properties. In 1938, Fischer and Suer proposed that water in the protoplasm is not free but in a chemically combined form—the protoplasm represents a combination of protein, salt and water—and demonstrated the basic similarity between swelling in living tissues and the swelling of gelatin and [[fibrin]] gels. Dimitri Nasonov (1944) viewed proteins as the central components responsible for many properties of the cell, including electrical properties.
By the 1940s, the bulk phase theories were not as well developed as the membrane theories. In 1941, Brooks &amp; Brooks published a monograph, "The Permeability of Living Cells", which rejects the bulk phase theories.

===Emergence of the steady-state membrane pump concept===

With the development of [[radioactive tracers]], it was shown that cells are not impermeable to {{chem|Na|+}}. This was difficult to explain with the membrane barrier theory, so the sodium pump was proposed to continually remove {{chem|Na|+}} as it permeates cells. This drove the concept that cells are in a state of [[dynamic equilibrium]], constantly using energy to maintain [[ion gradient]]s. In 1935, [[Karl Lohmann]] discovered [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and its role as a source of energy for cells, so the concept of a metabolically-driven [[sodium pump]] was proposed.
The tremendous success of [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin]], [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley]], and [[Bernard Katz|Katz]] in the development of the membrane theory of cellular membrane potentials, with differential equations that modeled the phenomena correctly, provided even more support for the membrane pump hypothesis.
 
The modern view of the plasma membrane is of a fluid lipid bilayer that has protein components embedded within it. The structure of the membrane is now known in great detail, including 3D models of many of the hundreds of different proteins that are bound to the membrane.
These major developments in cell physiology placed the membrane theory in a position of dominance and stimulated the imagination of most physiologists, who now apparently accept the theory as fact—there are, however, a few dissenters.[citation needed]
===The reemergence of the bulk phase theories===

In 1956, Afanasy S. Troshin published a book, ''The Problems of Cell Permeability'', in Russian (1958 in German, 1961 in Chinese, 1966 in English) in which he found that permeability was of secondary importance in determination of the patterns of equilibrium between the cell and its environment. Troshin showed that cell water decreased in solutions of galactose or urea although these compounds did slowly permeate cells. Since the membrane theory requires an impermanent solute to sustain cell shrinkage, these experiments cast doubt on the theory. Others questioned whether the cell has enough energy to sustain the sodium/potassium pump. Such questions became even more urgent as dozens of new metabolic pumps were added as new chemical gradients were discovered.

In 1962, [[Gilbert Ling]] became the champion of the bulk phase theories and proposed his association-induction hypothesis of living cells.

[[File:Endomembrane system diagram en (edit).svg|thumb|Endomembrane system diagram en| Eukaryote cell.]]
Cells can be subdivided into the following subcategories:

# ''[[Prokaryote]]s'': Prokaryotes are relatively small cells surrounded by the plasma membrane, with a characteristic cell wall that may differ in composition depending on the particular organism.&lt;ref name=w11&gt;Wolfe, p.&amp;nbsp;11&lt;/ref&gt; Prokaryotes lack a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] (although they do have circular or linear [[DNA]]) and other membrane-bound [[organelle]]s (though they do contain [[ribosome]]s). The [[protoplasm]] of a prokaryote contains the chromosomal region that appears as [[fibrous]] deposits under the microscope, and the [[cytoplasm]].&lt;ref name=w11/&gt; [[Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]] are the  two [[domain (biology)|domains]] of prokaryotes.
# ''[[Eukaryote]]s'': Eukaryotic cells are also surrounded by the plasma membrane, but  on the other hand, they  have distinct nuclei bound by a [[nuclear membrane]] or envelope. Eukaryotic cells also contain membrane-bound organelles, such as  ([[mitochondria]], [[chloroplasts]], [[lysosomes]], rough and smooth [[endoplasmic reticulum]], [[vacuoles]]).&lt;ref name=w13&gt;Wolfe, p.&amp;nbsp;13&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they possess organized chromosomes which store genetic material.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Animals have evolved a greater diversity of cell types in a [[multicellular]] body (100–150 different cell types), compared
with 10–20 in plants, fungi, and protoctista.&lt;ref&gt;Margulis, L. &amp; Chapman, M.J. (2009). Kingdoms and Domains: An Illustrated Guide to the Phyla of Life on Earth ([4th ed.]. ed.). Amsterdam: Academic Press/Elsevier. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chloragogen cells''', also called as ''y cells'', are cells in [[annelids]] that function similarly to the [[liver]] in vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.academic.ru/dic.nsf/en_invertebrate_zoology/2694/chloragogen&lt;/ref&gt;

The cells store [[glycogen]] and neutralize toxins, are yellowish in colour due to the presence of yellow [[Granule (cell biology)|granules]] called chloragosomes and are present in [[Coelom#Coelomic_fluid|coelomic fluid]] of some annelids.

These cells are derived from the inner coelomic epithelium, and help in [[Excretory system|excretory functions]], as most commonly demonstrated in earthworms.&lt;ref&gt;''Biology and Ecology of Earthworms, Volume 3'',  Clive A. Edwards, P.J. Bohlen, p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

They have characteristic vesicular bulging which store and transport substances like glycogen and [[nitrogenous waste]]s. They take part in the [[deamination]] of amino acids and [[urea cycle|synthesis of urea]].

[[Silicates]] taken in along with food are deposited in the chloragogen cells.

'''Comparative cognition''' is the comparative study of the mechanisms and origins of [[cognition]] in various [[species]], and is sometimes seen as more general than, or similar to, [[comparative psychology]].
From a biological point of view, work is being done on the brains of [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] that should yield techniques precise enough to allow an understanding of the workings of the human brain on a scale appreciative of individual groups of [[neurons]] rather than the more regional scale previously used. Similarly, gene activity in the human [[brain]] is better understood through examination of the brains of mice by the Seattle-based [[Allen Institute for Brain Science]] (see link below), yielding the freely available [[Allen Brain Atlas]]. This type of study is related to comparative cognition, but better classified as one of [[comparative genomics]]. Increasing emphasis in [[psychology]] and [[ethology]] on the biological aspects of [[perception]] and [[behavior]] is bridging the gap between [[genomics]] and [[behavioral analysis]].

In order for scientists to better understand cognitive function across a broad range of species they can systematically compare cognitive abilities between closely and distantly related species&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Horik|first=Jayden|last2=Emery|first2=Nathan J.|date=2011-11-01|title=Evolution of cognition|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science|language=en|volume=2|issue=6|pages=621–633|doi=10.1002/wcs.144|pmid=26302412|issn=1939-5086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this process they can determine what kinds of selection pressure has led to different cognitive abilities across a broad range of animals. For example, it has been hypothesized that there is convergent evolution of the higher cognitive functions of corvids and apes, possibly due to both being omnivorous, visual animals that live in social groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''conservation and restoration of silver objects''' is an activity dedicated to the preservation and protection of objects of historical and [[Silver (household)|personal value]] made from [[silver]]. When applied to [[cultural heritage]] this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]].

Historically, objects made from silver were created for religious, artistic, technical, and domestic uses. The act of [[conservation and restoration]] strives to prevent and slow the deterioration of the object as well as protecting the object for future use. The prevention and removal of surface tarnish is the primary concern of conservator-restorers when dealing with silver objects.

== Use of silver ==
[[Silver]] is a [[precious metal]] that has been mined for use as early as 4000 B.C. in [[Anatolia]] (Modern [[Turkey]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 History of Silver|url=http://www.925-1000.com/silverhistory.html |publisher=The Silver Institute|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because silver is malleable and durable it has been used for many purposes which include [[jewelry]], tableware, ornaments, [[coin]]s, musical instruments and [[movie film]]. It is often used as a plating on other metals.

==Tarnish==
{{About||additional information|tarnish}} 
All metals, apart from pure gold, will corrode naturally when exposed to elements such as air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberge|first=Pierre|title=Gold Corrosion|url=http://corrosion-doctors.org/MatSelect/corrgold.htm|publisher=Corrosion Doctors|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; High relative humidity, moisture, and air pollutants  are common causes of corrosion in metals, including silver.&lt;ref name=Erhardt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Erhardt|first=David|author2=Charles S. Tumosa and Marion F. Mecklenburg|title=Applying science to the question of museum climate|journal=Museum Microclimates|year=2007|series=National Museum of Denmark|pages=11–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Silver is known in the chemistry world as a [[noble metal]] which means it is resistant to corrosion, but not completely.  Whether [[silver plating]] or pure silver, the composite of the metal will [[tarnish]] when exposed to air and sulfur.

Tarnish is a chemical reaction on the surface of metal (copper, brass, silver, etc.) and causes a layer of corrosion. In the case of silver tarnish, the silver combines with sulfur and forms [[silver sulfide]] ( Ag2S ) which is black. The original silver surface can be restored if the layer of silver sulfide is removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=At Home Experiment: Put a Shine on it|url=http://scifun.chem.wisc.edu/homeexpts/TARNISH.html|publisher=SciFun|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On some metals, tarnish serves as a protective layer known as a [[patina]] and is typically found on copper and bronze roofing, architectural elements, statues and bells.

== Collections care ==
{{Main article|Collections care}}

===Storage and handling ===
Proper handling, storage, and treatment can help prevent deterioration of silver objects.&lt;ref name="Erhardt"/&gt; Metals are best conserved when stored in an even and low humidity atmosphere, ideally at 40% [[relative humidity]] or lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bachmann |first1=Konstanze |title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators |date=1992 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |isbn=9781560981749 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=icJvDwAAQBAJ |language=en |pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silver tends to corrode easily when stored in damp, moist locations such as a basement because it will accelerate tarnishing. Some storage boxes contain  materials, such as wood, acidic paper, rubber, and adhesives, that can off-gas corrosive materials. Conservators wear [[Nitrile rubber|nitrile]] gloves when handling silver to prevent oils, ammonia, and salts from the skin from corroding the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bachmann |first1=Konstanze |title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators |date=1992 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |isbn=9781560981749 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=icJvDwAAQBAJ |language=en |page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preventing interaction with sulfur gases===
Sulfur-containing gases and particulates can tarnish the surface of silver. These corrosive agents can come from air pollution, paints, textiles, bacterial by-products, and other chemically treated objects or building materials. When storing silver, museum conservators wrap silver in [[sulfur]]-free tissue paper and store in a tight sealed [[polyethylene]] bag. [[Activated charcoal]] is sometimes used to absorb sulfur by placing it in the bag but not in direct contact with the object. Likewise, Pacific Silver Cloth has also been used by museums to prevent tarnishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bachmann |first1=Konstanze |title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators |date=1992 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |isbn=9781560981749 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=icJvDwAAQBAJ |language=en |pages=99–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lacquering===
{{About||lacquering|lacquer|other uses|lacquerware}}
[[Lacquer]]ing is the process of creating a hard durable finish on the surface of an object such as wood or metal.
Polished silver is sometimes lacquered to protect against tarnish and to prevent over-polishing. There are different types of [[resin]]s that are used such as Acryloid B-72 and Incralac. If silver pieces are being displayed in the open, such as in a house or museum exhibit case, it is difficult to prevent corrosion from air exposure. A surface coating will prevent or slow tarnishing and is a service done by professionals or conservator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bachmann |first1=Konstanze |title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators |date=1992 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |isbn=9781560981749 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=icJvDwAAQBAJ |language=en |pages=100–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most used coatings is Agateen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=Beverly|title=The De-electrification and Re-electrification of Historic Lighting Fixtures at Winterthur Museum|journal=Journal of the American Institute of Conservation|year=2003|volume=42|series=6|issue=3|pages=457–462|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic42-03-006_3.html|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacquer is applied to a surface that has been cleaned with [[ethanol]], [[acetone]], or [[methyl ethyl ketone]]. Oils from human hands prevent the lacquer from adhering to the silver. Agateen No. 27 ([[Nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]]) and [[Paraloid B-72]] are the most commonly used lacquers however there is a debate which lacquer, cellulose nitrate or acrylic, is best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wharton|first=Glenn|title=The Cleaning and Lacquering of Museum silver|journal=Western Association for Art Conservation|date=Jan 1989|volume=11|issue=1|pages=4–5|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn11/wn11-1/wn11-103.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historic methods of treating silver ==
The art of crafting objects out of silver, also known as [[silversmith]]ing, has been around for centuries. With the creation of hand-made silver objects, the issue of cleaning and caring for these items was a concern. Silversmiths would give advice to clients on how to properly care for their silver. Here are examples of instructions given by silversmiths in the 17th and 18th centuries.

: 1737 - "Clean it now and then with only warm water and soap, with a Spunge, and then wash it  with clean water, and dry it very well with a soft Linnen cloth, and keep it in a dry place, for the damp will spoyle it".&lt;ref name="Cripps 1967 17–18"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cripps|first=Wilfred|title=Old English Plate|year=1967|publisher=Spring Books|location=London|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:1679 - "...rubb the [[flagon]]s and [[chalice]]s from topp to the Bottome, not crosswise, but the Bason and patnes are to be rubb’d roundwise, not acrosse, and by noe means use either [[chalk]], [[sand]], or [[salt]]" &lt;ref name="Cripps 1967 17–18"/&gt;

Although dated, these instructions are very similar to current methods of cleaning and polishing of silver.

== Current practices ==
The following sections discuss the different methods in which silver objects can be cleaned and polished. Some of the methods described below can cause damage to the surface of the silver, such as scratching or accelerated tarnishing. A conservator should be consulted if there are any questions about the methods below especially when dealing with archaeological, antique or sensitive objects.&lt;ref name=cfs/&gt;

===Museum conservation practices – historical objects===

Water sensitive objects are masked in plastic wrap to avoid getting wet. A [[slurry]] of precipitated (pharmaceutical grade) [[calcium carbonate]] and [[deionized water]] is created and rubbed onto the silver piece with a cotton rag or cotton ball. It is recommended that the slurry be tested on the bottom or in a non-visible area of the silver for abrasiveness. If the slurry is too abrasive it will scratch the surface and increase the potential for future tarnishing. The polish is applied with a soft cloth and polished in a circular motion.&lt;ref name=draymanwesser&gt;{{cite book|last=Drayman-Weisser|first=T|title=Caring for Your Collections|year=1992|publisher=Harry N. Abrams Incorp|location=New York|pages=109–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Unpolished and polished silver artwork pieces.jpg|left|thumb|Parts of a silver object from [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] collection, in the process of being polished with [[calcium carbonate]]. An unpolished piece  is on the left and a finished piece on the right.]]

[[Ethyl alcohol]] is sometimes added to the slurry mixture to help dry out excess water.  The slurry mixture is applied throughout the piece until completely polished. Dark tarnish spots are sometimes located on the surface and may need to be polished more than once to remove. Over polishing is an issue with silver and can cause harm to the surface of the metal. After polishing, the silver object is rinsed in deionized water and dried with a cotton cloth.&lt;ref name=cfs&gt;{{cite web|last=National Park Service|title=Caring for Silver and Copper Alloy Materials|url=http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/10-02.pdf|work=Conserve O Gram|publisher=NPS|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once cleaned and dried the silver is wrapped in [[acid-free]] tissue paper and placed in a sealed plastic bag. A [[3M]] anti-tarnish strip is also placed in the bag to absorb any sulfur that may be in the air. The tissue paper is used as a buffer to prevent the silver surface coming into contact with the anti-tarnish strip.&lt;ref name=draymanwesser/&gt;

===Waddings===
Waddings are cloths that have been infused with an organic [[solvent]]. Because they contain solvents instead of water, they can be used for polishing metal objects that cannot be exposed to water. Polishing waddings will leave abrasive particles behind and the residue can be  removed using a soft brush or by rubbing the surface with a soft [[linen]] cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Selwyn|first=L|title=Care and Tarnish Removal|url=http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/publications/notes/9-7_e.pdf|publisher=Canadian Conservation Institute|accessdate=4 March 2012|date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural methods===
The following sections include methods that use natural methods such as water and salt to clean the surface of silver. Some of the methods use heat which may be dangerous to silver tableware such as candlesticks or knife handles. Water trapped in crevices of silver objects can accelerate tarnishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bachmann |first1=Konstanze |title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators |date=1992 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |isbn=9781560981749 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=icJvDwAAQBAJ |language=en |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Single Ingredient'' - [[Toothpaste]] is applied with a clean cloth as a gentle abrasive with a soft bristle toothbrush and rinsed in water.&lt;ref name=natural/&gt;

''Boiling Water Bath'' - The silver object or pieces are placed into an aluminum pot and covered with water. One [[tablespoon]] of salt and [[baking soda]] is added and boiled for three minutes. After cooling, the silver is placed into a warm soapy water mixture and cleaned with a cotton cloth and then dried with a separate cotton cloth.&lt;ref name=natural/&gt; 

''Soaking bath'' – A glass roasting pan is lined with [[aluminum foil]] with the dull side facing downwards. The silver is placed atop of the foil and a [[quart]] of boiling water is poured over the pieces with two tablespoons of baking soda. The silver soaks for five minutes and is dried with a clean cloth.&lt;ref name=natural&gt;{{cite web|last=Douglas|first=Ellen|title=All Natural Way to Clean Tarnished Silver|url=http://greenliving.nationalgeographic.com/allnatural-way-clean-tarnished-silver-3214.html|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical dips===
A popular and quick method for polishing silver is the use of chemical dips. Dips work by dissolving the tarnished surface of the silver at a highly accelerated rate. Many dips are made of [[acid]]s and other agents. Acids are very corrosive and pose a danger to the silver surface as well as to the user. Dips can be harmful to objects with sealed surfaces such as candlesticks, trophies and teapots with hollow components because the chemical could leak into the hollow area and can never be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herman|first=Jeffrey|title=Silver Care|url=http://www.silversmithing.com/care.htm#Chemical%20Dips|publisher=Society of Silversmiths|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike museum quality polishing, employing a slurry of calcium carbonate and ionized water, dips are quicker and less expensive. However, dips are more abrasive to the surfaces of silver, gold, and other metals. NOTE: Jeffrey Herman confirms this method damages silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tarn-X Tarnish Remover Review and Other Silver Dips - WARNING! |url=http://www.hermansilver.com/tarn-x.htm |website=www.hermansilver.com |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laser cleaning===
Can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=SALIMBENI |first1=RENZO |title=LASER TECHNIQUES FOR CONSERVATION OF ARTWORKS |url=http://www.ace.hu/am/2006_1/AM-2006-1-RS.pdf |publisher=Institute of Applied Physics “Nello Carrara”- CNR, |accessdate=1 October 2013 |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The above process wil naturally lead to the cleaning of silver, which is passed through lasers to remove any dirt and pollutants.

Polishing wheels, also known as buffing wheels or polishing mops, use a specific electric tool to physically remove tarnish from the surface rather than chemically as with the calcium carbonate slurry or commercial dips.&lt;ref name=wheel/&gt;

Because silver is soft,  the surface can be easily cut or scratched. The main buffing type used for silver, gold, and plated objects is Canton flannel. This flannel is made of very soft material and will not scratch the plated, lacquered, or other soft surfaces.&lt;ref name=wheel/&gt;

Along with buffing wheels, particular compounds are used to help polish the material. Two main types of compounds used for silver and gold surfaces are red and blue compounds. Red, also known as [[jeweler's rouge]], polishes without any cutting action. The blue compound is a dryer compound and is used with a grease-less wheel that also does not cut or scratch the surface.&lt;ref name=wheel&gt;{{cite web|last=Caswell Electroplating in Miniature|title=How to Buff and Polish: An Introduction to Buffing &amp; Polishing|url=http://www.caswellplating.com/buffman.htm|publisher=Caswell Inc.|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum conservation practices - Archaeology objects==

Archaeological silver objects are particularly sensitive to mistakes in planning or carrying out conservation restoration. The essential problem connected with archaeological silver objects is brittleness.&lt;ref&gt;Wanhill, R.J.H., 2000, Brittle archaeological silver. Identification, restoration and conservation, Materialen, 16, 30– 5; also NLR Technical Publication NLR.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain objects, such as those that are completely mineralized, nielloed, or gil, are particularly problematic.  When dealing with archaeological objects, reversible processes, such as the use of Paraloid B-72 glue, are preferred to permanent treatments.

Benzotriazole can be used as corrosion inhibitor for archaeological importance. Suitable protective coatings include Paraloid B-72 (or Paraloid B 67 - soluble in white spirit) and Renaissance Wax.

'''Cutin''' is one of two [[wax]]y polymers that are the main components of the [[plant cuticle]], which covers all aerial surfaces of [[plant]]s. The other major cuticle polymer is [[Cutan (polymer)|cutan]], which is much more readily [[taphonomy|preserved]] in the fossil record,.&lt;ref name=Briggs1999&gt;{{citation

There are two major [[monomer]] families of cutin, the C16 and C18 families. The C16 family consists mainly of 16-hydroxy [[palmitic acid]] and 9,16- or 10,16-dihydroxypalmitic acid. The C18 family consists mainly of 18-hydroxy [[oleic acid]], 9,10-epoxy-18-hydroxy [[stearic acid]], and 9,10,18-trihydroxystearate.&lt;ref name=Holloway1982&gt;Holloway, PJ (1982).

The '''EUR-ACE (European Accredited Engineer)''' Label is a certificate awarded to courses of study in Engineering that are accredited by authorized quality assurance and accreditation agencies in the [[European Higher Education Area]]. 

The [[European Network for Accreditation of Engineering Education]] (ENAEE) grants this authorization to agencies that accredit degree programs in Engineering in accordance with the European Framework Standards and ENAEE's Standards for Accreditation Agencies.

The EUR-ACE label may be awarded to First Cycle (Bachelor) and Second Cycle (Master) accredited degrees in [[Engineering]].

==History==

The European Standing Observatory for the Engineering Profession and Education (ESOEPE) was established in September 2000. Its aim was to improve systems of accreditation of engineering degree programs in Europe.

In 2004 ESOEPE submitted a proposal to the European Commission. This proposal envisaged the establishment of a quality label (the EUR-ACE Label) which could be awarded to engineering degree programs which had reached certain educational standards, as defined by their learning outcomes.

The proposal was accepted by the EU Commission and funding provided for the project.
ESOEPE was dissolved; ENAEE was established and implemented the EUR-ACE Project.

The EUR-ACE Project concluded on 31/03/2006 with the presentation of the results in a public workshop in which the EUR-ACE label was listed among the six EC-sponsored “European quality labels in higher education”.
.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecaconsortium.net/event/paris/doc/WG4-ECA position paper&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach to using learning outcomes in the ENAEE European Framework Standards has been corroborated in a number of publications and projects since the establishment of ENAEE.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/a-tuning-ahelo-conceptual-framework-of-expected-desired-learning-outcomes-in-engineering_5kghtchn8mbn-en?citeformat=ris&lt;/ref&gt;

.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wfeo-ceie.org/news1.php?downFile&amp;id=4/&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 19 November 2014, authorized agencies sign a Mutual Recognition Agreement whereby they  accept each other's accreditation decisions in respect of Bachelor and Master engineering degree programs which they accredit.

==Agencies authorised to award the EUR-ACE label==

As of 21 November 2017 ENAEE had authorised 15 agencies to award the EUR-ACE label, which has been awarded to some 2600 engineering degree programmes in 35 countries both within and outside of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enaee.trynisis.com&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8799">'''Eco-innovation''' is the development of products and processes that contribute to [[sustainable development]], applying the commercial application of knowledge to elicit direct or indirect ecological improvements. This includes a range of related ideas, from [[environmentally friendly]] technological advances to socially acceptable innovative paths towards [[sustainability]]. The field of research that seeks to explain how, why, and at what rate new "ecological" [[Idea|ideas]] and [[technology]] spread is called [[eco-innovation diffusion]].

==Concept==

The idea of eco-innovation is fairly recent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Díaz-García|first=Cristina|last2=González-Moreno|first2=Ángela|last3=Sáez-Martínez|first3=Francisco J.|date=2015|title=Eco-innovation: insights from a literature review|journal=Innovation: Management, Policy &amp; Practice|volume=17|issue=1|pages=6–23|doi=10.1080/14479338.2015.1011060|issn=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first appearances of the concept of eco-innovation in the literature is in the book by Claude Fussler and Peter James.&lt;ref&gt;Fussler, C. &amp; P. James, 1996; ''Driving Eco-Innovation: A Breakthrough Discipline for Innovation and Sustainability'', Pitman Publishing: London, 364 p.&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent article, Peter James defines eco-innovation as "new products and processes which provide customer and business value but significantly decrease environmental impacts".&lt;ref name="james"&gt;James, P., 1997; 'The Sustainability Circle: a new tool for product development and design', ''Journal of Sustainable Product Design'' 2: 52:57, http://www.cfsd.org.uk/journal&lt;/ref&gt; Klaus Rennings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rennings|first=Klaus|date=2000|title=Redefining innovation - eco-innovation research and the contribution from ecological economics|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800999001123|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=32|issue=2|pages=319–332|doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(99)00112-3|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduces the term eco-innovation addressing explicitly three kinds of changes towards sustainable development: technological, social and institutional innovation.

Eco-innovation is closely linked to a variety of related concepts. It is often used interchangeably with "[[environmental innovation]]", and is also often linked with [[environmental technology]], [[eco-efficiency]], [[Ecodesign|eco-design]], [[environmental design]], [[sustainable design]], or [[sustainable innovation]]. While the term "environmental innovation" is used in similar contexts to "eco-innovation", the other terms are mostly used when referring to product or process design, and therefore focus more on the technological aspects of eco-innovation rather than the societal or political aspects. [[Ecovation]] is the process by which responsible capitalism aligns with ecological innovation to construct products which have a generative nature and are recyclable back into the environment for usage in other industries.

===As a technological term===

The most common usage of the term "eco-innovation" is to refer to [[innovative]] products and processes that reduce environmental impacts. This is often used in conjunction with eco-efficiency and eco-design. Leaders in many industries have been developing innovative technologies in order to work towards [[sustainability]]. However, these are not always practical, or enforced by policy and legislation.

===As a social process===

Another position held (for example, by the organisation [http://www.eco-innovation.net Eco Innovation]) is that this definition should be complemented: eco-innovations should also bring greater social and cultural acceptance. In this view, this "social pillar" added to James's&lt;ref name="james" /&gt; definition is necessary because it determines learning and the effectiveness of eco-innovations. This approach gives eco-innovations a social component, a status that is more than a new type of commodity, or a new sector, even though [[environmental technology]] and eco-innovation are associated with the emergence of new economic activities or even branches (e.g., [[waste treatment]], [[recycling]], etc.). This approach considers eco-innovation in terms of usage rather than merely in terms of product. The social pillar associated with eco-innovation introduces a governance component that makes eco-innovation a more integrated tool for [[sustainable development]].

== Diffusion ==
Literature in the field of eco-innovations often focuses on policy, regulations, technology, market and firm specific factors rather than [[Diffusion of innovations|diffusion]]. However, understanding of [[diffusion of eco-innovations]] recently has gained more importance given the fact that some eco-innovations are already at a mature stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karakaya|first=Emrah|last2=Hidalgo|first2=Antonio|last3=Nuur|first3=Cali|date=2014|title=Diffusion of eco-innovations: A review|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032114001051|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=33|issue=|pages=392–399|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2014.01.083|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Survey research shows that most customers hold positive attitudes towards various types of eco-innovations.

M., Michel, M. K., &amp; Teti, L. O. (1994). The development of emotion regulation and dysregulation: A clinical perspective. (Vol. 59, pp. 73-100). Wiley-Blackwell. {{jstor|1166139}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be defined as [[extrinsic]] and [[intrinsic]] processes responsible for monitoring, evaluating, and modifying emotional reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = R.

Emotional regulation is a complex process that involves [[Initiation|initiating]], inhibiting, or modulating one's state or [[Behavior#Psychology|behavior]] in a given situation{{spaced ndash}}for example the subjective experience (feelings), cognitive responses (thoughts), emotion-related physiological responses (for example heart rate or hormonal activity), and emotion-related behavior (bodily actions or expressions). Functionally, emotional regulation can also refer to processes such as the tendency to focus one's attention to a task and the ability to suppress inappropriate behavior under instruction. Emotional regulation is a highly significant function in human life.

Every day, people are continually exposed to a wide variety of potentially arousing [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]]. Inappropriate, extreme or unchecked emotional reactions to such stimuli could impede functional fit within society; therefore, people must engage in some form of emotion regulation almost all of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Koole, S. L. (2009). The psychology of emotion regulation: An integrative review. (23 ed., Vol. 1, pp. 4-41). Psychology Press. Retrieved from http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02699930802619031&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, [[emotional dysregulation]] has been defined as difficulties in controlling the influence of emotional [[arousal]] on the organization and quality of thoughts, actions, and interactions. Individuals who are emotionally dysregulated exhibit patterns of responding in which there is a mismatch between their goals, responses, and/or modes of expression, and the demands of the [[social environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeman | first1 = J. | last2 = Cassano | first2 = M. | last3 = Perry-Parrish | first3 = C. | last4 = Stegall | first4 = S. | year = 2006 | title = Emotion regulation in children and adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 155–168 | doi=10.1097/00004703-200604000-00014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there is a significant association between emotion dysregulation and symptoms of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[Eating disorder|eating pathology]], and [[substance abuse]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Aldao, A., Nolen-Hoeksema, S., &amp; Schweizer, S.

New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==

===Process model===
The process model of emotion regulation is based upon the modal model of emotion. The modal model of emotion suggests that the emotion generation process occurs in a particular sequence over time. This sequence occurs as follows:
#Situation: the sequence begins with a situation (real or imagined) that is emotionally relevant.
#[[Attention]]: attention is directed towards the emotional situation.
#[[Cognitive appraisal|Appraisal]]: the emotional situation is evaluated and interpreted.
#Response: an emotional response is generated, giving rise to loosely coordinated changes in experiential, behavioral, and physiological response systems.
Because an emotional response (4.) can cause changes to a situation (1.), this model involves a feedback loop from (4.) Response to (1.) Situation. This feedback loop suggests that the emotion generation process can occur recursively, is ongoing, and dynamic.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gross, J. J. &amp; Thompson, R. A. (2007). Emotion regulation: Conceptual foundations. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 3-24). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process model contends that each of these four points in the emotion generation process can be subjected to regulation. From this conceptualization, the process model posits five different families of emotion regulation that correspond to the regulation of a particular point in the emotion generation process. They occur in the following order:&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gross | first1 = J. J. | year = 1998 | title = The emerging field of emotion regulation: An integrative review | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 271–299 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.2.3.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Situation selection
#Situation modification
#Attentional deployment
#Cognitive change
#Response modulation
The process model also divides these emotion regulation strategies into two categories: antecedent-focused and response-focused. Antecedent-focused strategies (i.e., situation selection, situation modification, attentional deployment, and cognitive change) occur before an emotional response is fully generated. Response-focused strategies (i.e., response modulation) occur after an emotional response is fully generated.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gross | first1 = J. J. | year = 1998 | title = Antecedent- and response-focused emotion regulation: Divergent consequences for experience, expression, and physiology | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 224–237 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.1.224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategies==

===Situation selection===
Situation selection involves choosing to avoid or approach an emotionally relevant situation. If a person selects to avoid or disengage from an emotionally relevant situation, he or she is decreasing the likelihood of experiencing an emotion. Alternatively, if a person selects to approach or engage with an emotionally relevant situation, he or she is increasing the likelihood of experiencing an emotion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Typical examples of situation selection may be seen interpersonally, such as when a parent removes his or her child from an emotionally unpleasant situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fox | first1 = N. A. | last2 = Calkins | first2 = S. D. | year = 2003 | title = The development of self-control of emotion: Intrinsic and extrinsic influences | url = | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 7–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of situation selection may also be seen in psychopathology. For example, avoidance of social situations to regulate emotions is particularly pronounced for those with [[social anxiety disorder]]&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = A. | last2 = Papageorgiou | first2 = C. | year = 1998 | title = Social phobia: Effects of external attention on anxiety, negative beliefs, and perspective taking | url = | journal = Behavior Therapy | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 357–370 | doi=10.1016/s0005-7894(98)80037-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[avoidant personality disorder]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Effective situation selection is not always an easy task. For instance, humans display difficulties [[Affective forecasting|predicting their emotional responses]] to future events. Therefore, they may have trouble making accurate and appropriate decisions about which emotionally relevant situations to approach or to avoid.&lt;ref&gt;Loewenstein, G. (2007). Affect regulation and affective forecasting. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation ''(pp.180-203). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situation modification===
Situation modification involves efforts to modify a situation so as to change its emotional impact.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Situation modification refers specifically to altering one's external, physical environment. Altering one's "internal" environment to regulate emotion is called cognitive change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Examples of situation modification may include injecting humor into a speech to elicit laughter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hofmann | first1 = S. G. | last2 = Gerlach | first2 = A. L. | last3 = Wender | first3 = A. | last4 = Roth | first4 = W T. | year = 1997 | title = Speech disturbances and gaze behavior during public speaking in subtypes of social phobia | url = | journal = Journal of Anxiety Disorders | volume = 11 | issue = 6| pages = 573–585 | doi=10.1016/s0887-6185(97)00040-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; or extending the physical distance between oneself and another person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edelmann | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Iwawaki | first2 = S. | year = 1987 | title = Self-reported expression and consequences of embarrassment in the United Kingdom and Japan | url = | journal = Psychologia | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 205–216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attentional deployment===
Attentional deployment involves directing one's attention towards or away from an emotional situation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====Distraction====
[[Distraction]], an example of attentional deployment, is an early selection strategy, which involves diverting one's attention away from an emotional stimulus and towards other content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sheppes | first1 = G. | last2 = Gross | first2 = J. J. | year = 2011 | title = Is timing everything? Temporal considerations in emotion regulation | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 319–331 | doi=10.1177/1088868310395778}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distraction has been shown to reduce the intensity of painful&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seminowicz | first1 = D.

This is because distraction easily filters out high-intensity emotional content, which would otherwise be relatively difficult to appraise and process.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sheppes | first1 = G. | last2 = Scheibe | first2 = S. | last3 = Suri | first3 = G. | last4 = Gross | first4 = J.

====Rumination====
[[Rumination (psychology)|Rumination]], an example of attentional deployment,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; is defined as the passive and repetitive focusing of one's attention on one's symptoms of distress and the causes and consequences of these symptoms. Rumination is generally considered to be a maladaptive emotion regulation strategy, as it tends to exacerbate emotional distress. It has also been implicated in a host of disorders including [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nolen-Hoeksema | first1 = S. | last2 = Wisco | first2 = B. E. | last3 = Lyubomirsky | first3 = S. | year = 2008 | title = Rethinking rumination | url = | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 3 | issue = 5| pages = 400–424 | doi=10.1111/j.1745-6924.2008.00088.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Worry====

====Thought suppression====
[[Thought suppression]], an example of attentional deployment, involves efforts to redirect one's attention from specific thoughts and mental images to other content so as to modify one's emotional state.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Campbell-Sills, L. &amp; Barlow, D. H. (2007). Incorporating emotion regulation into conceptualizations and treatments of anxiety and mood disorders. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 542-559). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Although thought suppression may provide temporary relief from undesirable thoughts, it may ironically end up spurring the production of even more unwanted thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wegner | first1 = D. M. | last2 = Zanakos | first2 = S. | year = 1994 | title = Chronic thought suppression | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 615–640 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1994.tb00311.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy is generally considered maladaptive, being most associated with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===Cognitive change===
Cognitive change involves changing how one appraises a situation so as to alter its emotional meaning.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====Reappraisal====
Reappraisal, an example of cognitive change, is a late selection strategy, which involves reinterpreting the meaning of an event so as to alter its emotional impact.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, this might involve reinterpreting an event by broadening one's perspective to see "the bigger picture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schartau | first1 = P. E. | last2 = Dalgleish | first2 = T. | last3 = Dunn | first3 = B.

As opposed to distraction, individuals show a relative preference to engage in reappraisal when facing stimuli of low negative emotional intensity because these stimuli are relatively easy to appraise and process.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Reappraisal is generally considered to be an adaptive emotion-regulation strategy. Compared to suppression, which is correlated negatively with many psychological disorders,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; reappraisal can be associated with better interpersonal outcomes, and can be positively related to wellbeing.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gross, James |author2=John, Oliver |title=Individual differences in two emotion regulation processes: Implications for affect, relationships, and well-being|pmid=12916575|url=http://doi.apa.org/journals/psp/85/2/348.pdf|year=2003|volume=85|issue=2|pages=348–62|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.85.2.348}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some researchers argue that context is important when evaluating the adaptiveness of a strategy, suggesting that in some contexts reappraisal may be maladaptive.&lt;ref name="Tamir, M. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tamir | first1 = M | year = 2009 | title = What do people want to feel and why?

====Distancing====
Distancing, an example of cognitive change, involves taking on an independent, third-person perspective when evaluating an emotional event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ochsner | first1 = K. N. | last2 = Gross | first2 = J. J. | year = 2008 | title = Cognitive emotion regulation: Insights from social, cognitive, affective neuroscience | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 153–158 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00566.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distancing has been shown to be an adaptive form of self-reflection, facilitating the emotional processing of negatively valenced stimuli,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ayduk | first1 = O. | last2 = Kross | first2 = E. | year = 2009 | title = Asking why from a distance facilitates emotional processing: A reanalysis of Wimalaweera and Moulds (2008) | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 88–92 | doi=10.1016/j.brat.2008.06.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; reducing emotional and cardiovascular reactivity to negative stimuli, and increasing problem-solving behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ayduk | first1 = O. | last2 = Kross | first2 = E. | year = 2010 | title = From a distance: Implications of spontaneous self-distancing for adaptive self-reflection | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 98 | issue = 5| pages = 809–829 | doi=10.1037/a0019205 | pmid=20438226 | pmc=2881638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Humor====
[[Humor]], an example of cognitive change, has been shown to be an effective emotion regulation strategy. Specifically, positive, good-natured humor has been shown to effectively upregulate positive emotion and downregulate negative emotion. On the other hand, negative, mean-spirited humor is less effective in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Samson | first1 = A. C. | last2 = Gross | first2 = J. J. | year = 2012 | title = Humour as emotion regulation: The differential consequences of negative versus positive humour | url = | journal = Cognition and Emotion | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 375–384 | doi=10.1080/02699931.2011.585069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response modulation===
Response modulation involves attempts to directly influence experiential, behavioral, and physiological response systems.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====Expressive suppression====
[[Expressive Suppression|Expressive suppression]], an example of response modulation, involves inhibiting emotional expressions. It has been shown to effectively reduce facial expressivity, subjective feelings of positive emotion, heart rate, and [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic activation]]. However, the research is mixed regarding whether this strategy is effective for downregulating negative emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dan-Glauser | first1 = E. S. | last2 = Gross | first2 = J. J. | year = 2011 | title = The temporal dynamics of two response-focused forms of emotion regulation: Experiential, expressive, and autonomic consequences | url = | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 1309–1322 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.2011.01191.x| pmc = 3136552 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also shown that expressive suppression may have negative social consequences, correlating with reduced personal connections and greater difficulties forming relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butler | first1 = E. A. | last2 = Egloff | first2 = B. | last3 = Wlhelm | first3 = F. H. | last4 = Smith | first4 = N. C. | last5 = Erickson | first5 = E. A. | last6 = Gross | first6 = J. J. | year = 2003 | title = The social consequences of expressive suppression | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 48–67 | doi = 10.1037/1528-3542.3.1.48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expressive suppression is generally considered to be a maladaptive emotion-regulation strategy. Compared to reappraisal, it is correlated positively with many psychological disorders,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; associated with worse interpersonal outcomes, is negatively related to wellbeing,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; and requires the mobilization of a relatively substantial amount of cognitive resources.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Jane|title=The Cognitive Consequences of Concealing Feelings|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=August 2004|volume=13|issue=4|pages=131–134|doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00291.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some researchers argue that context is important when evaluating the adaptiveness of a strategy, suggesting that in some contexts suppression may be adaptive.&lt;ref name="Tamir, M. 2009"/&gt;

====Drug use====
[[Drug]] use, an example of response modulation, can be a way to alter emotion-associated physiological responses. For example, [[Ethanol|alcohol]] can produce [[sedative]] and [[anxiolytic]] effects&lt;ref&gt;Sher, K. J. &amp; Grekin, E. R. (2007). Alcohol and affect regulation. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 560-580). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[beta blockers]] can affect sympathetic activation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Exercise====
[[Exercise]], an example of response modulation, can be used to downregulate the physiological and experiential effects of negative emotions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Regular physical activity has also been shown to reduce emotional distress and improve emotional control.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oaten|first=Megan|author2=Cheng, Ken|title=Longitudinal gains in self-regulation from regular physical exercise|journal=British Journal of Health Psychology|year=2006|volume=11|issue=4|pages=717–733|doi=10.1348/135910706X96481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sleep====
[[Sleep]] plays a role in emotion regulation, although stress and worry can also interfere with sleep. Studies have shown that sleep, specifically [[REM sleep]], down-regulates reactivity of the [[amygdala]], a brain structure known to be involved in the processing of emotions, in response to previous emotional experiences.&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walker |first=Matthew P. |date=March 2009 |title=The Role of Sleep in Cognition and Emotion |url=http://walkerlab.berkeley.edu/reprints/Walker_NYAS_2009.pdf |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=1156 |pages=168–197 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04416.x |access-date=25 November 2015 |pmid=19338508}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the flip side, [[sleep deprivation]] is associated with greater emotional reactivity or overreaction to negative and stressful stimuli. This is a result of both increased amygdala activity and a disconnect between the amygdala and the [[prefrontal cortex]], which regulates the amygdala through inhibition, together resulting in an overactive emotional brain.&lt;ref name="walker"/&gt; Due to the subsequent lack of emotional control, sleep deprivation may be associated with depression, [[impulsivity]], and mood swings. Additionally, there is some evidence that sleep deprivation may reduce emotional reactivity to positive stimuli and events and impair [[emotion recognition]] in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beattie |first=Louise |last2=Kyle |first2=Simon D. |last3=Espie |first3=Colin A. |last4=Biello |first4=Stephany M. |date=December 2015 |title=Social interactions, emotion and sleep: A systematic review and research agenda |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079214001579 |journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews |volume=24 |pages=83–100 |doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2014.12.005 |access-date=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychotherapy==

Emotion-regulation strategies are taught, and emotion-regulation problems are treated, in a variety of approaches to [[counseling]] and [[psychotherapy]], including [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), [[dialectical behavior therapy]] (DBT), [[emotion-focused therapy]] (EFT), and [[mindfulness-based cognitive therapy]] (MBCT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berking |first1=Matthias |authorlink1=Matthias Berking |last2=Wupperman |first2=Peggilee |last3=Reichardt |first3=Alexander |last4=Pejic |first4=Tanja |last5=Dippel |first5=Alexandra |last6=Znoj |first6=Hansjörg |date=November 2008 |title=Emotion-regulation skills as a treatment target in psychotherapy |journal=[[Behaviour Research and Therapy]] |volume=46 |issue=11 |pages=1230–1237 |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2008.08.005 |pmid=18835479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Kring |editor1-first=Ann M. |editor2-last=Sloan |editor2-first=Denise M. |date=2010 |title=Emotion Regulation and Psychopathology: A Transdiagnostic Approach to Etiology and Treatment |location=New York |publisher=[[Guilford Press]] |isbn=9781606234501 |oclc=319318901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infancy===
Intrinsic emotion-regulation efforts during [[infancy]] are believed to be guided primarily by innate physiological response systems.&lt;ref&gt;Derryberr, D., &amp; Rothbart, M. K. (2001). Early temperament and emotional development. In A. F. Kalverboer &amp; A. Gramsbergen (Eds.), ''Handbook of Brain and Behavior in Human Development'' (pp. 967-988). Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; These systems usually manifest as an approach towards and an avoidance of pleasant or unpleasant stimuli. At three months, infants can engage in self-soothing behaviors like sucking and can reflexively respond to and signal feelings of distress.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Rothbart, M., Ziaie, H., &amp; O'Boyle, C. (1992). Self-regulation and emotion in infancy. In N. Eisenberg, &amp; R. Fabes (Eds.), ''Emotion and Its Regulation in Early Development'' (pp. 7-23). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass/Pfeiffer.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, infants have been observed attempting to suppress anger or sadness by knitting their brow or compressing their lips.&lt;ref name="Malatesta et. al."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malatesta|first=C.Z.|author2=Grigoryev, P. |author3=Lamb, C. |author4=Albin, M. |author5=Culver, C. |title=Emotional socialization and expressive development in preterm and full-term infants|journal=Child Development|year=1986|volume=57|pages=316–330|doi=10.2307/1130587|pmid=3956316|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between three and six months, basic [[Motor skills|motor functioning]] and attentional mechanisms begin to play a role in emotion regulation, allowing infants to more effectively approach or avoid emotionally relevant situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kochanska | first1 = G. | last2 = Coy | first2 = K.

Extrinsic emotion-regulation efforts by caregivers, including situation selection, modification, and distraction, are particularly important for infants.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Calkins, S. D., &amp; Hill, A. (2007). Caregiver influence on emerging emotion regulation: Biological and environmental transactions in early development. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 229-248). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The emotion regulation strategies employed by caregivers to attenuate distress or to upregulate positive affect in infants can impact the infants' emotional and behavioral development, teaching them particular strategies and methods of regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Sroufe, L. A. (1996). ''Emotional development: The organization of emotional life in the early years''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The type of [[Attachment styles|attachment style]] between caregiver and infant can therefore play a meaningful role in the regulatory strategies infants may learn to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kochanska | first1 = G | year = 2001 | title = Emotional development in children with different attachment histories: The first three years | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 474–490 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent evidence supports the idea that maternal singing has a positive effect on affect regulation in infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trehub | first1 = S. E. | last2 = Ghazban | first2 = N. | last3 = Corbeil | first3 = M. | year = 2015 | title = Musical affect regulation in infancy | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1337 | issue = 1| pages = 186–192 | doi=10.1111/nyas.12622 | pmid=25773634}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singing play-songs, such as "The Wheels on the Bus" or "She'll Be Comin' Round the Mountain" have a visible affect-regulatory consequence of prolonged positive affect and even alleviation of distress. In addition to proven facilitation of social bonding, when combined with movement and/or rhythmic touch, maternal singing for affect regulation has possible applications for infants in the NICU and for adult caregivers with serious personality or adjustment difficulties.

===Toddler-hood===
By the end of the first year, [[toddler]]s begin to adopt new strategies to decrease negative arousal. These strategies can include rocking themselves, chewing on objects, or moving away from things that upset them.&lt;ref name="Kopp"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kopp|first=C.B.|title=Regulation of distress and negative emotions|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1989|volume=25|pages=343–354|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.25.3.343|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; At two years, toddlers become more capable of actively employing emotion regulation strategies.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; They can apply certain emotion regulation tactics to influence various emotional states.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Additionally, maturation of brain functioning and language and motor skills permits toddlers to manage their emotional responses and levels of arousal more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Rueda, M. R., Posner, M. I., &amp; Rothbart, M. K. (2004). Attentional control and self-regulation. In R. F. Baumeister &amp; K. D. Vohs (Eds.),'' Handbook of self-regulation: Research, theory, and applications ''(pp. 283-300). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Extrinsic emotion regulation remains important to emotional development in toddlerhood. Toddlers can learn ways from their caregivers to control their emotions and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kopp | first1 = C. | year = 1989 | title = Regulation of distress and negative emotions: A developmental view | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 243–254 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.25.3.343}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, caregivers help teach self-regulation methods by distracting children from unpleasant events (like a [[vaccination]] shot) or helping them understand frightening events.&lt;ref name="Thompson, 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=R.A.|title=Emotional regulation: A theme in search of definition|journal=Monographs of Society for Research in Child Development|year=1994|volume=59|pages=2–3|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5834.1994.tb01276.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood===
Emotion-regulation knowledge becomes more substantial during childhood. For example, children aged six to ten begin to understand [[display rules]]. They come to appreciate the contexts in which certain emotional expressions are socially most appropriate and therefore ought to be regulated. For example, children may understand that upon receiving a gift they should display a smile, irrespective of their actual feelings about the gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = P.

Regarding the development of emotion dysregulation in children, one robust finding suggests that children who are frequently exposed to negative emotion at home will be more likely to display, and have difficulties regulating, high levels of negative emotion.&lt;ref name="Caspi et. al, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caspi|first=A.|author2=Moffitt, T.E. |author3=Morgan, J. |author4=Rutter, M. |author5=Taylor, A. |author6=Arseneault, L. |author7=Tully, L. |author8=Jacobs, C. |author9=Kim-Cohen, J. |author10=Polo-Tomas, M. |title=Maternal expressed emotion predicts children's antisocial behaviour problems: Using monozygotic-twin differences to identify environmental effects on behavioural development|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2004|volume=40|pages=149–161|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.40.2.149|pmid=14979757|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisenberg, Zhou &amp; Koller, 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenberg|first=N.|author2=Zhou, Q. |author3=Koller, S. |title=Brazilian adolescents' prosocial moral judgement and behaviour: Relations to sympathy, perspective-taking, gender-role orientation, and demographic characteristics|journal=Child Development|year=2001|volume=72|pages=518–534|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00294|pmid=11333082|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maughan &amp; Cicchetti"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maughan|first=A.|author2=Cicchetti, D.|title=Impact of child maltreatment and interadult violence on children's emotional regulation abilities and socioemotional adjustements|journal=Child Development|year=2002|volume=73|pages=1525–1542|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00488|pmid=12361317|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valiente, Eisenberg &amp; Spinrad, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Valiente|first=C.|author2=Fabes, R.A. |author3=Eisenberg, N. |author4=Spinrad, T.L. |title=The relations of parental expressivity and support to children's coping with daily stress|journal=Journal of Family Psychology|year=2004|volume=18|pages=97–106|doi=10.1037/0893-3200.18.1.97|pmid=14992613|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adolescence===
[[Adolescence|Adolescents]] show a marked increase in their capacities to regulate their emotions, and emotion-regulation decision making becomes more complex, depending on multiple factors. In particular, the significance of interpersonal outcomes increases for adolescents. When regulating their emotions, adolescents are therefore likely to take into account their social context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeman | first1 = J. | last2 = Cassano | first2 = M. | last3 = Perry-Parrish | first3 = C. | last4 = Stegall | first4 = S. | year = 2006 | title = Emotion regulation in children and adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 155–168 | doi=10.1097/00004703-200604000-00014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, adolescents show a tendency to display more emotion if they expect a sympathetic response from their peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeman | first1 = J. | last2 = Garber | first2 = J. | year = 1996 | title = Display rules for anger, sadness, and pain: it depends on who is watching | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 67 | issue = | pages = 957–973 | doi=10.2307/1131873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, spontaneous use of cognitive emotion-regulation strategies increases during adolescence, which is evidenced both by self-report data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garnefski | first1 = N. | last2 = Kraaij | first2 = V. | year = 2006 | title = Relationships between cognitive emotion regulation strategies and depressive symptoms: A comparative study of five specific samples | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 1659–1669 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2005.12.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and neural markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Luna | first1 = B. | last2 = Padmanabhan | first2 = A. | last3 = O'Hearn | first3 = K. | year = 2010 | title = What has fMRI told us about the development of cognitive control through adolescence? | url = | journal = Brain and Cognition | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 101–113 | doi = 10.1016/j.bandc.2009.08.005 | pmc = 2815087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adulthood===
Social losses increase and health tends to decrease as people age. As people get older their motivation to seek emotional meaning in life through social ties tends to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carstensen | first1 = L. A.

==Overview of perspectives==

===Neuropsychological perspective===

====Affective====
As people age, their [[affect (psychology)|affect]]{{spaced ndash}}the way they react to emotions{{spaced ndash}}changes, either positively or negatively. Studies show that positive affect increases as a person grows from adolescence to their mid 70s. Negative affect, on the other hand, decreases until the mid 70s. Studies also show that emotions differ in adulthood, particularly affect (positive or negative). Although some studies found that affect decreases{{Clarify|reason=Becomes less positive / more negative or rather becomes less extreme, i.e., less positive or less negative as applicable?|date=February 2017}} with age, some have concluded that adults in their middle age experience more positive affect and less negative affect than younger adults. Positive affect was also higher for men than women while the negative affect was higher for women than it was for men and also for single people. A reason that older people{{spaced ndash}}middle adulthood{{spaced ndash}}might have less negative affect is because they have overcome, "the trials and vicissitudes of youth, they may increasingly experience a more pleasant balance of affect, at least up until their mid-70s". Positive affect might rise during middle age but towards the later years of life{{spaced ndash}}the 70s{{spaced ndash}}it begins to decline while negative affect also does the same. This might be due to failing health, reaching the end of their lives and the death of friends and relatives.&lt;ref name="Labouvie"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Labouvie-Vief|first=Gisela|title=Dynamic Integration:Affect, Cognition and the Self in Adulthood|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=December 2003|volume=12|issue=6|pages=201–206|doi=10.1046/j.0963-7214.2003.01262.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to [[Reference range|baseline]] levels of positive and negative affect, studies have found individual differences in the time-course of emotional responses to [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]]. The [[Time|temporal]] dynamics of emotional regulation, also known as affective [[chronometry]], include two key variables in the emotional response process: rise time to peak emotional response, and recovery time to baseline levels of emotion.&lt;ref name="Davidson, R. J. 1998 pp. 307-330"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Davidson, R. J. |title= Affective Style and Affective Disorders: Perspectives from Affective Neuroscience|journal= Cognition and Emotion|volume= 12|year=1998|pages=307–330|doi=10.1080/026999398379628|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of affective chronometry typically separate positive and negative affect into distinct categories, as previous research has shown (despite some correlation) the ability of humans to experience changes in these categories independently of one another.&lt;ref&gt;Ruef, Anna Marie; Levenson, Robert W. Coan, James A. (Ed); Allen, John J. B. (Ed) "Continuous measurement of emotion: The affect rating dial" (2007). Handbook of emotion elicitation and assessment. Series in affective science., New York, NY, US: Oxford University Press, pp. 287–297.&lt;/ref&gt; Affective chronometry research has been conducted on clinical populations with [[anxiety]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], and [[personality disorders]], but is also utilized as a measurement to test the effectiveness of different therapeutic techniques (including [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] training) on [[emotional dysregulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Geschwind N.|pmid=21767001|year=2011|last2=Peeters|first2=F|last3=Drukker|first3=M|last4=Van Os|first4=J|last5=Wichers|first5=M|title=Mindfulness training increases momentary positive emotions and reward experience in adults vulnerable to depression: A randomized controlled trial|volume=79|issue=5|pages=618–28|doi=10.1037/a0024595|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neurological====
The development of functional [[magnetic resonance imaging|magnetic resonance]] imaging has allowed for the study of emotion regulation on a biological level. Specifically, research over the last decade strongly suggests that there is a neural basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frank | first1 = DW | last2 = Dewitt | first2 = M | last3 = Hudgens-Haney | first3 = ME | last4 = Schaeffer | first4 = DJ | last5 = Ball | first5 = BH | last6 = Schwarz | first6 = NF | last7 = Hussein | first7 = AA | last8 = Smart | first8 = LM | last9 = Sabatinelli | first9 = D | year = 2014 | title = Emotion regulation: Quantitative meta-analysis of functional activation and deactivation | url = | journal = Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 202–211 | doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.06.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufficient evidence has correlated emotion regulation to particular patterns of prefrontal activation. These regions include the [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]]al prefrontal cortex, the ventromedial [[prefrontal cortex]], and the [[dorsolateral]] prefrontal cortex. Two additional brain structures that have been found to contribute are the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex. Each of these structures are involved in various facets of emotion regulation and irregularities in one or more regions and/or interconnections among them are affiliated with failures of emotion regulation. An implication to these findings is that individual differences in prefrontal activation predict the ability to perform various tasks in aspects of emotion regulation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davidson | first1 = R.J. | last2 = Putnam | first2 = K.M. | last3 = Larson | first3 = C.L. | year = 2000 | title = Dysfunction in the neural circuitry of emotion regulation: A possible prelude to violence | url = | journal = Science | volume = 289 | issue = | pages = 591–594 | doi=10.1126/science.289.5479.591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociological===
People intuitively mimic [[facial expressions]]; it is a fundamental part of healthy functioning. Similarities across cultures in regards to [[nonverbal communication]] has prompted the debate that it is in fact a [[universal language]].&lt;ref name="Elfenbein, H. A. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elfenbein | first1 = H. A. | last2 = Ambady | first2 = N. | year = 2002 | title = On the universality and cultural specificity of emotion recognition: a meta-analysis | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 128 | issue = 2| pages = 203–235 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.2.203 | pmid=11931516}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be argued that emotional regulation plays a key role in the ability to emit the correct responses in social situations. Humans have control over facial expressions both [[conscious mind|consciously]] and [[unconscious mind|unconsciously]]: an intrinsic emotion program is generated as the result of a transaction with the world, which immediately results in an emotional response and usually a facial reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ekman | first1 = P. | last2 = Friesen | first2 = W. V. | last3 = Ancoli | first3 = S. | year = 1980 | title = Facial signs of emotional experience | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 1125–1134 | doi=10.1037/h0077722}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a well documented [[phenomenon]] that emotions have an effect on facial expression, but recent research has provided evidence that the opposite may also be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Izard | first1 = C. E. | year = 1990 | title = Facial expressions and the regulation of emotions | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 58 | issue = 3| pages = 487–498 | pmid = 2182826 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.58.3.487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This notion would give rise to the belief that a person may not only control his emotion but in fact influence them as well. Emotional regulation focuses on providing the appropriate emotion in the appropriate circumstances. Some theories allude to the thought that each emotion serves a specific purpose in coordinating [[organism]]ic needs with [[Environmental psychology|environmental]] demands (cole 1994). This skill, although apparent throughout all nationalities,&lt;ref name="Elfenbein, H. A. 2002"/&gt; has been shown to vary in successful application at different age groups. In experiments done comparing younger and older adults to the same unpleasant stimuli, older adults were able to regulate their emotional reactions in a way that seemed to avoid negative confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charles | first1 = S. T. | last2 = Carstensen | first2 = L. L. | year = 2008 | title = Unpleasant situations elicit different emotional responses in younger and older adults | url = | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 495–504 | doi = 10.1037/a0013284 | pmc = 2677442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings support the theory that with time people develop a better ability to regulate their emotions. This ability found in adults seems to better allow individuals to react in what would be considered a more appropriate manner in some social situations, permitting them to avoid adverse situations that could be seen as detrimental.

====Expressive regulation (in solitary conditions)====
In solitary conditions, emotional regulation can include a minimization-miniaturization effect, in which common outward expressive patterns are replaced with toned down versions of expression. Unlike other situations, in which physical expression (and its regulation) serve a social purpose (i.e. conforming to [[display rules]] or revealing emotion to outsiders), solitary conditions require no reason for emotions to be outwardly expressed (although intense levels of emotion can bring out noticeable expression anyway). The idea behind this is that as people get older, they learn that the purpose of outward expression (to appeal to other people), is not necessary in situations in which there is no one to appeal to.&lt;ref name="Holodynski"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holodynski|first=Manfred|title=The Miniaturization of Expression in the Development of Emotional Self-Regulation|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2004|volume=40|issue=1|pages=16–28|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.40.1.16|pmid=14700461}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the level of emotional expression can be lower in these solitary situations.

===Stress===
According to Yu. V. Scherbatykh, emotional stress in situations like school examinations can be reduced by engaging in self-regulating activities prior to the task being performed. To study the influence of [[Self-control|self-regulation]] on mental and [[physiological]] processes under exam stress, Shcerbatykh conducted a test with an experimental group of 28 students (of both sexes) and a control group of 102 students (also of both sexes).&lt;ref name=Scherbatykh&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shcherbatykh|first=Yu. V.|title=Self-Regulation of Autonomic Homeostasis in Emotional Stress|journal=Human Physiology|year=2000|volume=26|issue=5|pages=641–642|url=http://www.no-stress.ru/stress/stress_science/emotional_stress_regulation.html|doi=10.1007/BF02760382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the moments before the examination, [[situational]] stress levels were raised in both groups from what they were in quiet states. In the experimental group, participants engaged in three self-regulating techniques (concentration on respiration, general body relaxation, and the creation of a mental image of successfully passing the examination). During the examination, the anxiety levels of the experimental group were lower than that of the control group. Also, the percent of unsatisfactory marks in the experimental group was 1.7 times less than in the control group. From this data, Scherbatykh concluded that the application of self-regulating actions before examinations helps to significantly reduce levels of emotional strain, which can help lead to better performance results.&lt;ref name=Scherbatykh /&gt;

===Decision making===
Identification of our emotional self-regulating process can facilitate in the decision making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Miclea, M. |author2=Miu, A. |pmid=20364902|title=Emotion Regulation and Decision Making Under Risk and Uncertainty|year=2010|volume=10|issue=2|pages=257–65|doi=10.1037/a0018489|journal=Emotion (Washington, D.C.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current literature on emotion regulation identifies that humans characteristically make efforts in controlling emotion experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gross, J. J.|pmid=12212647|url=http://sprweb.org/articles/Gross02.pdf|year=2002|title=Emotion regulation: Affective, cognitive, and social consequences|volume=39|issue=3|pages=281–91|journal=Psychophysiology|doi=10.1017/s0048577201393198}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is then a possibility that our present state emotions can be altered by emotional regulation strategies resulting in the possibility that different regulation strategies could have different decision implications.

==Effects of low self regulation==
With a failure in emotional regulation there is a rise in [[psychosocial]] and emotional dysfunctions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bandura, A. |author2=Caprara, G. V. |author3=Barbaranelli, C. |author4=Gerbino, M. |author5=Pastorelli, C. |title=Role of Affective Self-Regulatory Efficacy in Diverse Spheres of Psychosocial Functioning|pmid=12795389 |jstor=3696228|year=2003|volume=74|issue=3|pages=769–82|journal=Child Development|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00567}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused by traumatic experiences due to an inability to regulate emotions. These traumatic experiences typically happen in grade school and are sometimes associated with [[bullying]]. Children who can't properly self-regulate express their volatile emotions in a variety of ways, including screaming if they don't have their way, lashing out with their fists, or bullying other children. Such behaviors often elicit negative reactions from the social environment, which, in turn, can exacerbate or maintain the original regulation problems over time, a process termed cumulative continuity. These children are more likely to have conflict-based relationships with their teachers and other children. This can lead to more severe problems such as an impaired ability to adjust to school and predicts school dropout many years later. Children who fail to properly self-regulate grow as teenagers with more emerging problems. Their peers begin to notice this "immaturity", and these children are often excluded from social groups and teased and harassed by their peers. This "immaturity" certainly causes some teenagers to become social outcasts in their respective social groups, causing them to lash out in angry and potentially violent ways. Being teased or being an outcast during the teenage years is especially damaging and could lead to a dysfunctional future,{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} which is why it is recommended to foster emotional self-regulation in children as early as possible.

'''Fauvism''' is the style of '''''les Fauves''''' ([[French language|French]] for "the wild beasts"), a group of early twentieth-century [[modern art]]ists whose works emphasized [[painterly]] qualities and strong color over the [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] values retained by [[Impressionism]]. While Fauvism as a style began around 1904 and continued beyond 1910, the [[Art movement|movement]] as such lasted only a few years, 1905–1908, and had three exhibitions.&lt;ref name=elderfield13&gt;[[John Elderfield]],  The ''"Wild Beasts" Fauvism and Its Affinities,'' 1976, [[Museum of Modern Art]], p.13, {{ISBN|0-87070-638-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Judi, et al., ''The Fauve Landscape'', 1990, Abbeville Press, p. 13, {{ISBN|1-55859-025-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of the movement were [[André Derain]] and [[Henri Matisse]].

Besides Matisse and [[André Derain|Derain]], other artists included [[Albert Marquet]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Louis Valtat]], [[Jean Puy]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Henri Manguin]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], [[Georges Rouault]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Kees van Dongen]] and [[Georges Braque]] (subsequently Picasso's partner in [[Cubism]]).&lt;ref name=elderfield13/&gt;

"How do you see these trees? They are yellow. So, put in yellow; this shadow, rather blue, paint it with pure [[ultramarine]]; these red leaves? Put in [[vermilion]]."
Fauvism has been compared to [[Expressionism]], both in its use of pure color and unconstrained brushwork.&lt;ref name=tate-fauvism/&gt; Some of the Fauves were among the first avant-garde artists to collect and study African and Oceanic art, alongside other forms of non-Western and folk art, leading several Fauves toward the development [[Cubism]].&lt;ref&gt;Joshua I.

==Origins==
[[File:Derain CharingCrossBridge.png|thumb|[[André Derain]], 1906, ''Charing Cross Bridge, London'', [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, DC.]]
[[Gustave Moreau]] was the movement's inspirational teacher;&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;Freeman, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; a controversial professor at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris and a [[Symbolist painters|Symbolist painter]], he taught Matisse, Marquet, Manguin, Rouault and Camoin during the 1890s, and was viewed by critics as the group's philosophical leader until Matisse was recognized as such in 1904.&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt; Moreau's broad-mindedness, originality and affirmation of the expressive potency of pure color was inspirational for his students.&lt;ref name=dempsey&gt;Dempsey, Amy (2002). ''Styles, Schools and Movements: An Encyclopedic Guide to Modern Art'', pp. 66-69, London: Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Matisse said of him, "He did not set us on the right roads, but off the roads.  He disturbed our complacency."&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt; This source of empathy was taken away with Moreau's death in 1898, but the artists discovered other catalysts for their development.&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt;

In 1896, Matisse, then an unknown art student, visited the artist [[John Peter Russell]] on the island of [[Belle Île]] off the coast of [[Brittany]].&lt;ref name=abc&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/booktalk/stories/s1430343.htm "Book talk: The Unknown Matisse..."], [[Radio National|ABC Radio National]], interview with [[Hilary Spurling]], 8 June 2005. Retrieved 1 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell was an [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] painter; Matisse had never previously seen an Impressionist work directly, and was so shocked at the style that he left after ten days, saying, "I couldn't stand it any more."&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; The next year he returned as Russell's student and abandoned his earth-colored palette for bright Impressionist colors, later stating, "Russell was my teacher, and Russell explained color theory to me."&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; Russell had been a close friend of [[Vincent van Gogh]] and gave Matisse a Van Gogh drawing.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;

In 1901, [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] encountered the work of [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]] for the first time at an exhibition, declaring soon after that he loved Van Gogh more than his own father; he started to work by squeezing paint directly onto the canvas from the tube.&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt; In parallel with the artists' discovery of contemporary avant-garde art came an appreciation of pre-[[Renaissance]] French art, which was shown in a 1904 exhibition, ''French Primitives''.&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt; Another aesthetic influence was African sculpture, of which [[Vlaminck]], [[Derain]] and Matisse were early collectors.&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt;

Many of the Fauve characteristics first cohered in [[Matisse]]'s painting, ''[[Luxe, Calme et Volupté]]'' ("Luxury, Calm and Pleasure"), which he painted in the summer of 1904, whilst in [[Saint-Tropez]] with [[Paul Signac]] and [[Henri-Edmond Cross]].&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt;

After viewing the boldly colored canvases of [[Henri Matisse]], [[André Derain]], [[Albert Marquet]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Kees van Dongen]], [[Charles Camoin]], and [[Jean Puy]] at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1905, the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] disparaged the painters as "''fauves''" (wild beasts), thus giving their movement the name by which it became known, ''Fauvism''. The artists shared their first exhibition at the 1905 Salon d'Automne. The group gained their name after [[Louis Vauxcelles|Vauxcelles]] described their show of work with the phrase "[[Donatello]] chez les fauves" ("Donatello among the wild beasts"), contrasting their "orgie of tones" with a [[Renaissance]]-style sculpture that shared the room with them.&lt;ref name="Gil Blas, 17 October 1905"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7522165g/f5.image Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon d'Automne'', Gil Blas, 17 October 1905.

[[Henri Rousseau]] was not a Fauve, but his large jungle scene ''[[The Hungry Lion Throws Itself on the Antelope]]'' was exhibited near Matisse's work and may have had an influence on the pejorative used.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberta Smith|Smith, Roberta]] (2006).

Following the Salon d'Automne of 1905 which marked the beginning of Fauvism, the Salon des Indépendants of 1906 marked the first time all the Fauves would exhibit together. The centerpiece of the exhibition was Matisse's monumental ''[[Le Bonheur de Vivre]] (The Joy of Life)''.&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt; Critics were horrified by the flatness, bright colors, eclectic style and mixed technique of ''Le Bonheur de Vivre''.&lt;ref name="Clement"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VcaMyvjUZhIC&amp;pg=PR23&amp;lpg=PR23&amp;dq=salle+VII,+salon+d'automne+de+1905&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=alVRJahAml&amp;sig=6SkzgOftNxhpsdYdDNKbJjzqXUY&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=metzinger&amp;f=false Russell T.

'''Faye Duchin''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dj|uː|tʃ|ᵻ|n}}; born 1944) is an American [[Computer Scientist]] and Professor of [[Economics]] at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] ("RPI"), where she was the Dean of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences from 1996 to 2002.&lt;ref name="Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economics.rpi.edu/pl/people/faye-duchin|title=Faye Duchin, Professor of Economics|publisher=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is active in the fields of [[ecological economics]] and [[industrial ecology]] and employs [[Input-output model|Input-Output Analysis]] in her work. Her faculty page at RPI states that she is "concerned with ways of achieving economic development while avoiding environmental disasters."

==Biography==
Faye Duchin was raised in a "very conventional setting" in [[Bayonne, New Jersey|Bayonne]], [[New Jersey]]. She attended [[Cornell University]], earning a BA in Experimental Psychology in 1965 &lt;ref name="Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="people"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economics.rpi.edu/index.php?siteid=18&amp;pageid=199&amp;personID=91|title=People – Department of Economics|publisher=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1973 completed her Ph.D. in Computer Science at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] with a dissertation on the newly passed [[Rent Control]] law in Berkeley.&lt;ref name="poly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poly.rpi.edu/article_view.php3?view=1041&amp;part=1|title=Dean Duchin has varied background|last=Lutzky|first=Raymond|date=2001-11-14|publisher=The Polytechnic|accessdate=2009-01-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911223642/http://www.poly.rpi.edu/article_view.php3?view=1041&amp;part=1|archivedate=2006-09-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="people"/&gt;

From 1977–1996, Duchin was on the faculty at [[New York University]], where she worked for Nobel Laureate [[Wassily Leontief]] on [[input-output economics]].&lt;ref name="poly"/&gt; In 1985, she became Director of the NYU Institute for Economic Analysis, a position she held until 1996&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpi.edu/~duchin/cv.html|title=CV|publisher=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|accessdate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; when she left to become Dean of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. In 2002, Duchin resigned as Dean.

==Professional affiliations==
Duchin served as president of the [[International Input-Output Association]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iioa.org/Who%20we%20are-offices.htm|title=Who we are|publisher=International Input-Output Association|accessdate=2008-11-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120904045151/http://www.iioa.org/Who%20we%20are-offices.htm|archivedate=2012-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2004 to 2006,&lt;ref name="activities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpi.edu/~duchin/activities.html|title=Activities|last=Duchin|first=Faye|publisher=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a former Vice President of the [[International Society for Ecological Economics]] (ISEE). She is a member of the editorial boards of various journals, including the journal of [[Industrial Ecology]], having held this position since the journal's founding in 1997.&lt;ref name="activities"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1530-9290/homepage/EditorialBoard.html&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the founders and a managing editor of the journal Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, She is author or co-author of thirty-three works published between 1973 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.scientificcommons.org/faye_duchin|title=Scientific Commons: Faye Duchin|publisher=ScientificCommons.org|accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly contributions==
Duchin has stated that she examines factors that could "make a difference in satisfying major global imperatives."&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; She has examined [[technological change]], [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle change]], [[quality of life]], [[income distribution]], [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]], [[international trade]], [[natural resource]] use and [[environmental degradation]] using [[input-output model]]s. She calls her work "problem-oriented rather than discipline- or technique-oriented" and has used an interdisciplinary approach to study [[sustainability]]. She claims to study physical realities and constraints, not just monetary values, by using process and engineering data to model technology and resource use.

Duchin's RPI web page describes her research agenda:
:"Based on the results of my empirical studies, I became convinced of the need for changes not only in technologies but also in household lifestyles, in particular household decisions regarding diet, housing and transportation. The plausibility and implications of such scenarios need to be explored in a global framework, and I have developed a new model of the world economy for this purpose."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economics.rpi.edu/pl/people/faye-duchin Duchin faculty web page at RPI]&lt;/ref&gt;

Duchin's recent work focuses on [[industrial ecology]], continuing work she began in the early 1990s. Her 1994 book begins with the question, "Can technology ensure environmentally sound [[economic development]]?"&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0195085744/|title=Amazon.com: The Future of the Environment: Ecological Economics and Technological Change: Faye Duchin, Glenn-Marie Lange: Books|publisher=Amazon.com, Inc|accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book uses quantitative analysis of empirical data and discusses alternative scenarios for the future.

'''''Female Chauvinist Pigs: Women and the Rise of Raunch Culture'''''&lt;ref name="levy"&gt;Ariel Levy, ''Female Chauvinist Pigs: Women and the Rise of Raunch Culture'', Free Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-7432-8428-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2005) is a book by  [[Ariel Levy (journalist)|Ariel Levy]] which critiques the highly sexualized American culture in which women are [[Objectification|objectified]], objectify one another, and are encouraged to objectify themselves. Levy refers to this as "'''raunch culture'''."

==Background==
According to Levy, raunch culture is a product of the unresolved feminist sex wars – the conflict between the women’s movement and the sexual revolution.&lt;ref name="seventy four"&gt;Levy 2005, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Another source places the beginnings of raunch culture in the [[permissive society]] of the 1960s, which in [[Postfeminism|postfeminist]] perspective was less about female sexual liberation than fulfilling the male fantasy of unlimited female availableness.&lt;ref&gt;Veronique Mottier, ''Sexuality: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford 2008) p. 56-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Levy also characterizes raunch culture as a backlash against the stereotypes of "prude" and "uptight" (women) applied to many second-wave feminists (e.g., anti-pornography feminists).&lt;ref name="seventy four"/&gt; [[Herbert Marcuse|Marcuse]]'s intuition of the increased role of sexuality in advanced industrialism&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Marcuse, ''One-Dimensional Man'' (London 2002) p. 78-9&lt;/ref&gt; was thereafter increasingly confirmed by a pragmatic alliance between [[neo-liberalism]] and the commodification of sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Walby, ''The Future of Feminism'' (Cambridge 2011) p. 21-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s saw the ever-growing [[sexualization]] of the media, with raunchiness emerging in the overlapping interfaces of music, TV, video and advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Dennis, ''Britney:Inside the Dream'' (2009) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; By the close of the century, figures like [[Germaine Greer]] were talking critically of [[Sex-positive feminism#Critiques of sex-positive feminism|sex-positive feminism]], whereby acknowledging one's inner "[[slut]]" (in a commodified context) was seen as an ultimate goal.&lt;ref&gt;Germaine Greer, ''the whole woman'' (London 1999) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Levy claims that the enjoyment of raunch, or "kitschy, slutty stereotypes of female sexuality", has existed through the ages, but it was once a phenomenon that existed primarily in the male sphere and has since become mainstream and highly visible.&lt;ref name="thirty four"&gt;Levy 2005, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Raunch culture has penetrated "political life, the music industry, art, fashion, and taste".&lt;ref name="thirty four"/&gt;

==Levy's critique of raunch culture==
Citing examples ranging from [[Playboy Bunny]] merchandise for women to the [[moral panic]] of [[Rainbow party (sexuality)|rainbow parties]], Levy argues that American mass culture has framed the game so perversely that young women now strive to be the "hottest" and "sexiest" girl they know rather than the most accomplished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22479337-16947,00.html|title=Turned on|work=The Australian|accessdate=October 31, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113030706/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22479337-16947,00.html|archivedate=November 13, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that raunch culture is focused on the sex appeal of women, it is solely image-based: "It's about inauthenticity and the idea that women should be constantly exploding in little bursts of exhibitionism. It's an idea that female sexuality should be about performance and not about pleasure."&lt;ref name="levy"/&gt; Levy argues that in a raunch culture, many women engage in performances of sexuality that are not expressions of their individual sexuality, but are designed for the pleasure of the male observer(s) – or appear as though they are trying to be pleasurable sex objects.&lt;ref name="levy"/&gt; Levy describes "hotness" as the degree to which someone is trying to be sexually attractive, regardless of how conventionally attractive they actually are.&lt;ref name=levy/&gt;

Further, Levy theorizes that many women internalize the objectifying [[male gaze]] that permeates a raunch culture, leading them to participate in self-objectification quite willingly, falsely believing that it is a form of female empowerment and sexual liberation.&lt;ref name="levy"/&gt; According to Levy there is nothing to support the "conception of raunch culture as a path to liberation rather than oppression".&lt;ref name="eighty two"&gt;Levy 2005, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Susan Brownmiller]], a well-known American feminist, journalist, author, and activist, share this opinion.&lt;ref name="eighty two"/&gt;

Although raunch originated in the male domain, Levy claims that it "no longer makes sense to blame men".&lt;ref name="thirty five"/&gt; Central to Levy’s analysis of raunch culture is the concept of "Female Chauvinist Pigs": women who sexually objectify other women and themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Levy 2005, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Levy, there are two strategies a Female Chauvinist Pig (FCP) employs to "deal with her femaleness".&lt;ref name="one hundred seven"&gt;Levy 2005, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first strategy, an FCP distinguishes herself from women who she deems excessively feminine ("girly-girls"), while simultaneously objectifying such women (e.g., going to strip clubs, reading Playboy, and talking about porn stars).&lt;ref name="one hundred seven"/&gt; Women may employ this strategy as an attempt to attain the elevated status of the dominant group and overcome their oppression by acting like [[male chauvinist]]s.&lt;ref name=levy/&gt; In the second strategy, an FCP objectifies herself through her choice of apparel and expression of stereotypes of female sexuality.&lt;ref name="one hundred seven"/&gt; This strategy may also be employed as an attempt to gain status, through embodying what society portrays as the ideal object of male desire.&lt;ref name=levy/&gt;

Levy criticizes what she refers to as "[[lipstick feminism|lipstick feminists]]" and "[[loophole]] women".{{ref|a}} According to Levy, lipstick feminists believe, for example, that [[striptease|stripping]] is empowering for women and that putting on a show to attract men, for instance through makeup, clothing, or [[girl-on-girl]] physical contact, is not contrary to the goals and ideals of feminism.  Levy disagrees with this view, criticizing such lipstick feminists as those involved in the CAKE organization, which provides sexually oriented entertainment for women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cakenyc.com/ CAKE website]&lt;/ref&gt; Levy quotes from the CAKE website: "The new sexual revolution is where sexual equality and feminism finally meet."&lt;ref&gt;Levy, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other end of the spectrum, Levy takes issue with women who make their way in a man's world by playing by men's rules.  Sometimes, she argues, these women even make their fame and fortune by objectifying other women; for example, Levy finds it interesting that the ''[[Playboy]]'' organization was run by a woman, [[Christie Hefner]], [[Hugh Hefner]]'s daughter. Levy addresses women who succeed in male-dominated fields on their own merit, but shy away from feminism, saying: "But if you are the exception that proves the rule, and the rule is that women are inferior, you haven't made any progress."&lt;ref&gt;Levy p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Levy proposes the following as a solution: "Ending raunch culture will require citizens to scrutinise the way they regard gender. Objectification is rooted in disrespect, condescending views of the opposite gender, and power struggles. When men realise that they have the capability to fundamentally respect women, and women realise that they have the power to present themselves as empowered, fully capable people, raunch culture may moan its last and final faked orgasm."&lt;ref name=levy/&gt;

==Examples of raunch culture==
===Playboy===
[[Playboy]], an American magazine company that features photographs of nude women, was founded by [[Hugh Hefner]], but is primarily run by women.&lt;ref name="thirty five"&gt;Levy 2005, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these women is Hefner’s daughter, [[Christie Hefner]], the chairman and CEO of Playboy Enterprises.&lt;ref name="thirty five"/&gt; 
The images displayed in Playboy are sometimes accompanied by brief biographies of the models; however, the focus is on the models’ sexualized bodies. Not all of the women who have appeared in the magazine have careers in modeling; many are celebrities (singers, actresses, etc.) or athletes, for example. Female Olympic athletes, before the summer 2004 games in Athens, interrupted their busy training schedules to pose nude in Playboy, or nearly nude in FHM (For Him Magazine).&lt;ref&gt;Levy 2005, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Man Show===
[[The Man Show]], a variety program on Comedy Central, was originally hosted by well-known comedians and television hosts [[Jimmy Kimmel]] and [[Adam Carolla]] and was one of the top shows on cable in 2000.&lt;ref name="one hundred twelve"&gt;Levy 2005, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, thirty-eight percent of the viewers were female, and it was co-executive produced by two women. The show presents women as sexual objects, is self-described as "chauvinistic fun", and concludes each episode with a scene of women bouncing on trampolines.&lt;ref name="one hundred twelve"/&gt; Levy reports that although women involved The Man Show are sexualized because of their gender, they are also told that they have temporary "[[honorary man]]" status.&lt;ref name="one hundred thirteen"&gt;Levy 2005, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; According to co-executive producer Jennifer Heftler, this status as "one of the guys" is an advantage of her job, in that it meant that she would no longer have to prove herself as a woman who is not excessively feminine or easily offended, and is thus relatable to men.&lt;ref name="one hundred thirteen"/&gt; Heftler posits that this advantage is also the female viewers’ incentive for watching The Man Show.&lt;ref name="one hundred thirteen"/&gt;

===Girls Gone Wild===
The [[Girls Gone Wild (franchise)|Girls Gone Wild]] (GGW) team tours locations where there are numerous young people who are likely to be drinking large quantities of alcohol –  spring break destinations, sports bars, [[Mardi Gras]], and "hard-partying colleges" – filming young women who are willing to expose their bodies on camera.&lt;ref&gt;Levy 2005, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Levy found that many women who appeared on GGW were eager to display their bodies for a GGW hat or T-shirt, while others did not immediately comply with the cajoling of peers or the crew, but eventually relented.&lt;ref name=levy/&gt;

===Stripping===
Levy, along with many feminists, perceives [[striptease|stripping]] as a perpetuation of the objectification of women, valuable only for its potential to serve as necessary income.&lt;ref name=levy/&gt; The author discusses the contrasting view, popular in raunch culture, in which stripping is idealized and conceptualized as liberating and empowering by numerous women, including feminists. As examples of this, Levy mentions "Cardio Striptease" classes (workouts in lingerie),&lt;ref&gt;Levy 2005, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''G-String Divas'',&lt;ref&gt;Levy 2005, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; a television show about strippers which was executive produced by [[Sheila Nevins]], feminist and well-known veteran of HBO.

===CAKE===
CAKE is a feminist group concerned with women’s sexuality in terms of liberation and self-expression. While the organization encourages women to explore their own sexuality, the parties themselves have the appearance of an average strip club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/may/15/gender.features11|title=No more faking|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=May 15, 2006|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Levy, pornography and objectification of women are prevalent at CAKE parties and events.&lt;ref&gt;Levy 2005, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levy 2005, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flight envelope protection''' is a [[human machine interface]] extension of an [[Aircraft flight control systems|aircraft’s control]] system that prevents the pilot of an aircraft from making control commands that would force the aircraft to exceed its structural and aerodynamic operating limits.&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;Pratt, R. (2000). Flight control systems: practical issues in design and implementation. Institution of Electrical Engineers. {{ISBN|978-0-85296-766-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abzug"&gt;Abzug MJ, Larrabee EE. (2002). Airplane stability and control: a history of the technologies that made aviation possible. Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-80992-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Risukhin"&gt;Risukhin V. (2001). Controlling Pilot Error: Automation. McGraw-Hill Professional. {{ISBN|978-0-07-137320-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in some form in all modern commercial [[fly-by-wire]] aircraft.&lt;ref name="North"&gt;North, David. (2000) "Finding Common Ground in Envelope Protection Systems". ''Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology'',  Aug 28, pp. 66–68.&lt;/ref&gt; The professed advantage of flight envelope protection systems is that they restrict a pilot's excessive control inputs, whether in surprise reaction to emergencies or otherwise, from translating into excessive [[flight control surface]] movements. Notionally, this allows pilots to react quickly to an emergency while blunting the effect of an excessive control input resulting from "startle," by electronically limiting excessive control surface movements that could over-stress the airframe and endanger the safety of the aircraft.&lt;ref name="Waldrop"&gt;Waldrop MM. (1989). Flying the Electric Skies. Science, 244: 1532-1534. {{JSTOR|1704109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alizart R. Fulford GA. (1989) Electric Airliners. Science, 245: 581-583. {{JSTOR|1704444}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, these limitations have sometimes resulted in unintended [[human factors]] errors and accidents of their own.

==Function==
Aircraft have a [[flight envelope]] that describes its safe performance limits in regard to such things as minimum and maximum operating speeds, and its operating structural strength.&lt;ref name="Pratt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abzug"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Risukhin"/&gt; Flight envelope protection calculates that flight envelope (and adds a margin of safety) and uses this information to stop [[aviator|pilots]] from making control inputs that would put the aircraft outside that flight envelope.&lt;ref name="Waldrop"/&gt; For example, if the pilot uses the rearward [[side-stick]] to [[Roll, pitch, and yaw|pitch]] the aircraft nose up, the control computers creating the flight envelope protection will prevent the pilot pitching the aircraft beyond the [[Stall (flight)|stalling]] [[angle of attack]]. As a result, even if the pilot tried to apply more and more if rearward control, the flight envelope protection would cause the aircraft to ignore this command.&lt;ref name="North"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Waldrop"/&gt; Flight envelope protection can in this way increase aircraft safety by allowing the pilot to apply in an emergency maximum control forces while not at the same time inadvertently putting the aircraft outside the margins of its operational safety.

Examples of where this might stop [[Aviation accidents and incidents|air accidents]] are when it allows a pilot to make a quick evasive maneuver in response to a [[ground proximity warning system]] warning, or in quick response to an approaching aircraft and a potential [[mid air collision]].&lt;ref name="North"/&gt; In this case without a flight envelope protection system, "you would probably hold back from maneuvering as hard as you could for fear of tumbling out of control, or worse. You would have to sneak up on it [2.5 G, the design limit], and when you got there you wouldn't be able to tell, because very few commercial pilots have ever flown 2.5 G. But in the [[Airbus A320 family|A320]], you wouldn't have to hesitate: you could just slam the controller all the way to the side and instantly get out of there as fast as the plane will take you."&lt;ref name="Waldrop"/&gt; Thus the makers of the Airbus argue: "envelope protection doesn't constrain the pilot. It liberates the pilot from uncertainty-and thus enhances safety."&lt;ref name="Waldrop"/&gt;

== Airbus and Boeing==
The [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]] was the first commercial aircraft to incorporate full flight-envelope protection into its flight-control software. This was instigated by former Airbus senior vice president for engineering [[Bernard Ziegler]].  In the Airbus, the flight envelope protection cannot be overridden completely, although the crew can fly beyond flight envelope limits by selecting an alternate "control law".&lt;ref name="North"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Traverse P.

==Incidents==

===China Airlines Flight 006===
{{further|China Airlines Flight 006}}
One objection raised against flight envelope protection is the incident that happened to China Airlines Flight 006, a [[Boeing 747SP|Boeing 747SP-09]], northwest of San Francisco in 1985.&lt;ref name="Waldrop"/&gt; In this flight incident, the crew was forced to overstress (and structurally damage) the horizontal tail surfaces in order to recover from a [[Aerobatic maneuver|roll]] and near-vertical dive. (This had been caused by an automatic disconnect of the [[autopilot]] and incorrect handling of a yaw brought about by an engine flame-out).  The pilot recovered control with about 10,000&amp;nbsp;ft of altitude remaining (from its original high-altitude cruise). But to do that the pilot had to pull the aircraft with an estimated 5.5 G, or more than twice its design limits.&lt;ref name="Waldrop"/&gt; If the aircraft had a flight envelope protection system, this recovery could not have been performed. Against this objection, Airbus has responded that an A320 in the situation of Flight 006 "never would have fallen out of the air
in the first place: the envelope protection would have automatically kept it in level flight in spite of the drag of a stalled engine".&lt;ref name="Waldrop"/&gt;

===FedEx Flight 705===
{{further|FedEx Flight 705}}
FedEx Flight 705, a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]]-30, was a case of a [[FedEx]] Flight Engineer who, facing a dismissal, attempted to hijack the plane and crash it into FedEx Headquarters in order for his family to collect his life insurance policy.  After being attacked and severely injured, the flight crew was able to fight back and land the plane safely. In order to keep the attacker off balance and out of the cockpit the crew had to perform extreme maneuvers, including a [[barrel roll]] and a dive so fast the airplane couldn't measure its speed. Had the crew not been able to exceed the plane's flight envelope, the crew might not have been successful {{citation needed|date=August 2016}}.

===American Airlines Flight 587===
{{further|American Airlines Flight 587}}
American Airlines Flight 587, an [[Airbus A300]], crashed when the vertical stabiliser broke off due to large rudder inputs by the pilot. A flight-envelope protection system could have prevented this crash, though it can still be argued that an override button should be provided for contingencies when the pilots are aware of the need to exceed normal limits.

===US Airways Flight 1549===
{{further|US Airways Flight 1549}}
US Airways Flight 1549, an [[Airbus A320]], experienced a dual engine failure after a bird strike and subsequently landed safely in the Hudson River. The NTSB accident report&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR1003.pdf in particular section 1.6.3 and 2.7.2&lt;/ref&gt; mentions the effect of flight envelope protection: ''"The airplane’s airspeed in the last 150 feet of the descent was low enough to activate the alpha-protection mode of the airplane’s fly-by-wire envelope protection features... Because of these features, the airplane could not reach the maximum AOA attainable in pitch normal law for the airplane weight and configuration; however, the airplane did provide maximum performance for the weight and configuration at that time... The flight envelope protections allowed the captain to pull full aft on the sidestick without the risk of stalling the airplane."''

===Air France Flight 447===
{{further|Air France Flight 447}}
Air France Flight 447, an [[Airbus A330]], entered an aerodynamic stall from which it did not recover and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean killing all aboard.
Temporary inconsistency between measured speeds, likely a result of the obstruction of the pitot tubes by ice crystals, caused autopilot disconnection and reconfiguration to alternate law; 
A second consequence of the reconfiguration into alternate law was that stall protection no longer operated. The crew made inappropriate control inputs that caused the aircraft to stall and did not recognize that the aircraft had stalled.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6046">In [[structural engineering]] and [[mechanical engineering]], '''generalised beam theory (GBT)''' is a one-dimensional theory used to mathematically model how beams bend and twist under various loads. It is a generalization of classical [[Euler–Bernoulli beam theory]] that approximates a beam as an assembly of thin-walled plates that are constrained to deform as a [[Linear combination|linear combination]] of specified deformation [[Normal mode|modes]].&lt;ref name="deMiranda2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Miranda|first1=Stefano|last2=Gutiérrez|first2=Alejandro|last3=Miletta|first3=Rosario|last4=Ubertini|first4=Francesco|title=A generalized beam theory with shear deformation|journal=Thin-Walled Structures|date=June 2013|volume=67|pages=88–100|doi=10.1016/j.tws.2013.02.012|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==

Its origin is due to Richard Schardt (1966). Since then many other authors have extended the initial (first-order elastic) GBT formulations developed by Schardt and his co-workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schardt|first1=Richard|title=Generalised Beam Theory – an adequate method for coupled stability problems|journal=Thin-Walled Strcutures|date=1994|volume=19|issue=2-4|pages=161–180|doi=10.1016/0263-8231(94)90027-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davies|first1=JM|title=Recent research advances in cold-formed steel structures|journal=Journal of Constructional Steel Research|date=2000|volume=55|issue=1-3|doi=10.1016/S0143-974X(99)00089-9|pages=267–288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many extensions and applications of GBT have been developed by Camotim ([[Instituto Superior Técnico]], University of Lisbon, Portugal) and collaborators, since the beginning of the 21st century.

== Description ==
The theory can be applied without restrictions to any prismatic thin-walled structural member exhibiting straight or curved axial axis (any [[Structural load|loading]], any [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section geometry]], any boundary conditions).  GBT is in some ways analogous to the [[finite strip method]]&lt;ref name="deMiranda2013" /&gt; and can be a more computationally efficient method than modeling a beam with a full 2D or 3D [[finite element method]] to predict the member structural behavior.

GBT has been widely recognized as an efficient approach to analyzing thin-walled members and structural systems. The efficiency arises mostly from its modal nature – the [[Displacement field (mechanics)|displacement field]] is expressed as a linear combination of cross-section deformation modes whose amplitudes vary continuously along the member length (x axis)  - see Figures 2-3. Due to GBT assumptions inherent to a thin-walled member, only 3 non-null stress components are considered in the formulations (see Fig. 1).

Membrane displacement field (i.e., in the cross-section mid-surface):

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
u(s,x) &amp; = u_k(s) \zeta_{k,x}(x), \\
v(s,x) &amp; = v_k(s) \zeta_k(x), \\
w(s,x) &amp; = w_k(s) \zeta_k(x).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- [[File:GBT membrane displacement field.png|GBT membrane displacement field]] --&gt;

The GBT modal nature makes it possible to (i) acquire in-depth knowledge on the mechanics of the thin-walled member behaviour and (ii) judiciously exclude, from subsequent similar GBT analyses, those deformation modes found to play no (or negligible) role in the particular behaviour under scrutiny. Eliminating modes that play no role reduces the number of degrees of freedom involved in a GBT analysis and increases its computational efficiency. GBT has proven useful in the understanding of the structural behaviour under analysis as well as in its computational efficiency.&lt;ref name="deMiranda2013" /&gt;

The '''holonomic brain theory''', developed by neuroscientist [[Karl H. Pribram|Karl Pribram]] initially in collaboration with physicist [[David Bohm]], is a model of human [[cognition]] that describes the brain as a [[hologram|holographic]] storage network.&lt;ref name=Forsdyke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt; Pribram suggests these processes involve electric oscillations in the brain's fine-fibered dendritic webs, which are different from the more commonly known action potentials involving axons and synapses.&lt;ref name=Pribram1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vandervert/&gt; These oscillations are waves and create [[wave interference]] patterns in which memory is encoded naturally, and the waves may be analyzed by a [[Fourier transform]].&lt;ref name=Pribram1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vandervert/&gt;&lt;ref name=Berger&gt;{{cite journal | author = Berger D.H., Pribram K.H. | year = 1992 | title = The Relationship between the Gabor elementary function and a stochastic model of the inter-spike interval distribution in the responses of the visual cortex neurons | url = | journal = Biological Cybernetics | volume = 67 | issue = | pages = 191–194 | doi=10.1007/bf00201026}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pribram2004&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pribram K.H. | year = 2004 | title = Consciousness Reassessed | url = | journal = Mind and Matter | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 7–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabor, Pribram and others noted the similarities between these brain processes and the storage of information in a hologram, which can also be analyzed with a Fourier transform.&lt;ref name=Forsdyke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gabor1972/&gt; In a hologram, any part of the hologram with sufficient size contains the whole of the stored information. In this theory, a piece of a long-term memory is similarly distributed over a dendritic arbor so that each part of the dendritic network contains all the information stored over the entire network.&lt;ref name=Forsdyke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gabor1972/&gt;&lt;ref name=Borsellino/&gt; This model allows for important aspects of human consciousness, including the fast associative [[memory]] that allows for connections between different pieces of stored information and the [[Distributed representation|non-locality]] of memory storage (a specific memory is not stored in a specific location, i.e. a certain neuron).&lt;ref name=Forsdyke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bokkon/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gabor1968&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gabor D | year = 1968 | title = Holographic Model of Temporal Recall | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 217 | issue = | page = 584 | doi=10.1038/217584a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and development==
In 1946 [[Dennis Gabor]] invented the hologram mathematically, describing a system where an image can be reconstructed through information that is stored throughout the hologram.&lt;ref name=Pribram1999&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pribram K. H., Meade S. D. | year = 1999 | title = Conscious awareness: Processing in the synaptodendritic web | url = | journal = New Ideas in Psychology | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 205–214 | doi = 10.1016/S0732-118X(99)00024-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He demonstrated that the information pattern of a three-dimensional object can be encoded in a beam of light, which is more-or-less two-dimensional. Gabor also developed a mathematical model for demonstrating a [[holographic associative memory]].&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kelly M. A. |author2=Blostein D. |author3=Mewhort D. J. K. | year = 2013 | title = Encoding structure in holographic reduced representations | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 67 | issue = 2| pages = 79–93 | doi=10.1037/a0030301}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Gabor's colleagues, Pieter Jacobus Van Heerden, also developed a related holographic mathematical memory model in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Van Heerden P. J. | year = 1963 | title = A New Optical Method of Storing and Retrieving Information | url = | journal = Applied Optics | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 387–392 | doi = 10.1364/AO.2.000387 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Van Heerden P. J. | year = 1963 | title = Theory of Optical Information Storage in Solids | url = | journal = Applied Optics | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 393–400 | doi = 10.1364/AO.2.000393 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VanHeerden&gt;{{cite journal | author = Van Heerden P. J. | year = 1970 | title = Models for the brain | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 225 | issue = 5228| pages = 177–178 | doi=10.1038/225177a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model contained the key aspect of non-locality, which became important years later when, in 1967, experiments by both [[Valentino Braitenberg|Braitenberg]] and Kirschfield showed that exact localization of memory in the brain was false.&lt;ref name=Borsellino&gt;{{cite journal | author = Borsellino A., Poggio T. | year = 1972 | title = Holographic aspects of temporal memory and optomotor responses | url = | journal = Kybernetik | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 58–60 | doi=10.1007/bf00288785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Pribram had worked with psychologist [[Karl Lashley]] on Lashley's [[Engram (neuropsychology)|engram]] experiments, which used lesions to determine the exact location of specific memories in primate brains.&lt;ref name=Forsdyke&gt;{{cite journal | author = Forsdyke D. R. | year = 2009 | title = Samuel Butler and human long term memory: Is the cupboard bare? | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 258 | issue = | pages = 156–164 | doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2009.01.028 | pmid=19490862}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lashley made small lesions in the brains and found that these had little effect on memory. On the other hand, Pribram removed large areas of cortex, leading to multiple serious deficits in memory and cognitive function. Memories were not stored in a single neuron or exact location, but were spread over the entirety of a neural network. Lashley suggested that brain interference patterns could play a role in perception, but was unsure how such patterns might be generated in the brain or how they would lead to brain function.&lt;ref name=Pribram2011&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pribram H.H. | year = 2011 | title = Recollections | url = | journal = Neuroquantology | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 370–374 | doi=10.14704/nq.2011.9.3.447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several years later an article by neurophysiologist [[John Eccles (neurophysiologist)|John Eccles]] described how a wave could be generated at the branching ends of pre-synaptic axons. Multiple of these waves could create interference patterns. Soon after, [[Emmett Leith]] was successful in storing visual images through the interference patterns of laser beams, inspired by Gabor's previous use of Fourier transformations to store information within a hologram.&lt;ref&gt;Emmett N. Leith and Juris Upatnieks (1965). Photography by Laser. ''Scientific American'' Volume 212, Issue 6, June 1, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; After studying the work of Eccles and that of Leith,&lt;ref name=Pribram2011/&gt; Pribram put forward the hypothesis that memory might take the form of interference patterns that resemble laser-produced holograms.&lt;ref&gt;K. Pribram (1969). The Neurophysiology of Remembering. American Volume 220, Issue 1, January 1, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Physicist David Bohm presented his ideas of holomovement and [[Implicate Order|implicate and explicate order]].&lt;ref name=Globus&gt;{{cite journal | author = Globus G. G., O'Carroll C. P. | year = 2010 | title = Nonlocal neurology: Beyond localization to holonomy | url = | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 75 | issue = | pages = 425–432 | doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2010.04.012 | pmid=20418020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pribram became aware of Bohm's work in 1975&lt;ref&gt;[http://karlhpribram.net/wp-content/uploads/pdf/theory/T-166a.pdf The implicate brain] by Karl H. Pribram, karlhpribram.com&lt;/ref&gt; and realized that, since a hologram could store information within patterns of interference and then recreate that information when activated, it could serve as a strong metaphor for brain function.&lt;ref name=Pribram2011/&gt; Pribram was further encouraged in this line of speculation by the fact that DeValois and DeValois&lt;ref&gt;DeValois and DeValois, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; established "the spatial frequency encoding displayed by cells of the visual cortex was best described as a [[Fourier transform]] of the input pattern."&lt;ref name=Pribram87&gt;"Pribram, 1987"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory overview==

===The hologram and holonomy===
[[File:Hologram optical setup.jpg|thumbnail|Diagram of one possible hologram setup.]]
A main characteristic of a [[Holography|hologram]] is that every part of the stored information is distributed over the entire hologram.&lt;ref name=Andrew&gt;{{cite journal | author = Andrew A. M. | year = 1997 | title = The decade of the brain - further thoughts | url = | journal = Kybernetes | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 255–264 | doi=10.1108/03684929710163155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both processes of storage and retrieval are carried out in a way described by [[Fourier transform]]ation equations.&lt;ref name=Srivastava&gt;{{cite journal | author = Srivastava V., Edwards S. F. | year = 2004 | title = A mathematical model of capacious and efficient memory that survives trauma | url = | journal = Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications | volume = 333 | issue = 1–4| pages = 465–477 | doi=10.1016/j.physa.2003.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As long as a part of the hologram is large enough to contain the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference pattern]], that part can recreate the entirety of the stored image, except with more unwanted changes, called [[Noise (signal processing)|noise]].&lt;ref name=Gabor1972&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gabor D | year = 1972 | title = Holography, 1948–1971 | url = | journal = Science | volume = 177 | issue = 4046| pages = 299–313 | doi=10.1126/science.177.4046.299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analogy to this is the broadcasting region of a radio antenna. In each smaller individual location within the entire area it is possible to access every channel, similar to how the entirety of the information of a hologram is contained within a part.&lt;ref name=Pribram1999/&gt; Another analogy of a hologram is the way sunlight illuminates objects in the visual field of an observer. It doesn't matter how narrow the beam of sunlight is. The beam always contains all the information of the object, and when conjugated by a lens of a [[camera]] or the eyeball, produces the same full three-dimensional image. The Fourier transform formula converts spatial forms to spatial wave frequencies and vice versa, as all objects are in essence [[vibration|vibratory]] structures. Different types of lenses, acting similarly to [[Lens (optics)|optic lenses]], can alter the frequency nature of information that is transferred.

This non-locality of information storage within the hologram is crucial, because even if most parts are damaged, the entirety will be contained within even a single remaining part of sufficient size. [[Karl H. Pribram|Pribram]] and others noted the similarities between an optical hologram and [[memory]] storage in the human brain. According to the holonomic brain theory, memories are stored within certain general regions, but stored non-locally within those regions.&lt;ref name=Globus/&gt;&lt;ref name=LH&gt;{{cite journal | author = Longuet-Higgins H. C. | year = 1968 | title = Holographic model of temporal recall [50] | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 217 | issue = 5123| page = 104 | doi=10.1038/217104a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the brain to maintain function and memory even when it is damaged.&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;&lt;ref name=Srivastava/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baev/&gt; It is only when there exist no parts big enough to contain the whole that the memory is lost.&lt;ref name=Pribram1999/&gt; This can also explain why some children retain normal intelligence when large portions of their brain—in some cases, half—are removed. It can also explain why memory is not lost when the brain is sliced in different cross-sections.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;

[[File:Holomouse2.jpg|thumbnail|A single hologram can store 3D information in a 2D way. Such properties may explain some of the brain's abilities, including the ability to recognize objects at different angles and sizes than in the original stored memory.]]

Pribram proposed that neural holograms were formed by the diffraction patterns of oscillating electric waves within the cortex.&lt;ref name=Baev&gt;{{cite journal | author = Baev K.V. | year = 2012 | title = Solution of the Problem of Central Pattern Generators and a New Concept of Brain Functions | url = | journal = Neurophysiology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 414–432 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note the difference between the idea of a holonomic brain and a holographic one. Pribram does not suggest that the brain functions as a single hologram. Rather, the waves within smaller neural networks create localized holograms within the larger workings of the brain.&lt;ref name=Vandervert&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vandervert L. R. | year = 1995 | title = Chaos theory and the evolution of consciousness and mind: A thermodynamic-holographic resolution to the mind-body problem | url = | journal = New Ideas in Psychology | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 107–127 | doi = 10.1016/0732-118X(94)00047-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This patch holography is called holonomy or windowed Fourier transformations.

A holographic model can also account for other features of memory that more traditional models cannot. [[Hopfield network|The Hopfield memory model]] has an early memory saturation point before which memory retrieval drastically slows and becomes unreliable.&lt;ref name=Srivastava&gt;{{cite journal | author = Srivastava V., Edwards S. F. | year = 2004 | title = A mathematical model of capacious and efficient memory that survives trauma | url = | journal = Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications | volume = 333 | issue = 1–4| pages = 465–477 | doi=10.1016/j.physa.2003.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, holographic memory models have much larger theoretical storage capacities. Holographic models can also demonstrate associative memory, store complex connections between different concepts, and resemble forgetting through [[lossy compression|"lossy storage."]]&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kelly M. A. |author2=Blostein D. |author3=Mewhort D. J. K. | year = 2013 | title = Encoding structure in holographic reduced representations | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 67 | issue = 2| pages = 79–93 | doi=10.1037/a0030301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The synaptodendritic web===
[[File:Blausen 0843 SynapseTypes.png|thumb|A Few of the Various Types of Synapses]]
In classic brain theory the summation of electrical inputs to the [[dendrite]]s and soma (cell body) of a [[neuron]] either inhibit the neuron or excite it and set off an [[action potential]] down the [[axon]] to where it [[synapse]]s with the next neuron. However, this fails to account for different varieties of synapses beyond the traditional axodendritic (axon to dendrite). There is evidence for the existence of other kinds of synapses, including serial synapses and those between dendrites and soma and between different dendrites.&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt; Many synaptic locations are functionally bipolar, meaning they can both send and receive impulses from each neuron, distributing input and output over the entire group of dendrites.&lt;ref name=Pribram1998&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pribram K. H. | year = 1999 | title = Quantum holography: Is it relevant to brain function? | url = | journal = Information Sciences | volume = 115 | issue = 1–4| pages = 97–102 | doi = 10.1016/S0020-0255(98)10082-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Processes in this dendritic arbor, the network of teledendrons and dendrites, occur due to the oscillations of polarizations in the membrane of the fine-fibered dendrites, not due to the propagated nerve impulses associated with action potentials.&lt;ref name=Pribram1999/&gt; Pribram posits that the length of the delay of an input signal in the dendritic arbor before it travels down the axon is related to mental awareness.&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Persinger&gt;{{cite journal | author = Persinger M.A., Lavallee C. | year = 2012 | title = The Σn=n Concept and the Quantitative Support for the Cerebral-Holographic and Electromagnetic Configuration of Consciousness | url = | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 128–253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shorter the delay the more unconscious the action, while a longer delay indicates a longer period of awareness. A study by David Alkon showed that after unconscious [[Classical Conditioning|Pavlovian conditioning]] there was a proportionally greater reduction in the volume of the dendritic arbor, akin to synaptic elimination when experience increases the automaticity of an action.&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt; Pribram and others theorize that, while unconscious behavior is mediated by impulses through nerve circuits, conscious behavior arises from microprocesses in the dendritic arbor.&lt;ref name=Pribram1999/&gt;

At the same time, the dendritic network is extremely complex, able to receive 100,000 to 200,000 inputs in a single tree, due to the large amount of branching and the many dendritic spines protruding from the branches.&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt; Furthermore, synaptic [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]] and [[depolarization]] remains somewhat isolated due to the resistance from the narrow dendritic spine stalk, allowing a polarization to spread without much interruption to the other spines. This spread is further aided intracellularly by the [[microtubules]] and extracellularly by [[neuroglia|glial cells]]. These polarizations act as waves in the synaptodendritic network, and the existence of multiple waves at once gives rise to interference patterns.&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt;

===Deep and surface structure of memory===
Pribram suggests that there are two layers of cortical processing: a surface structure of separated and localized neural circuits and a deep structure of the dendritic arborization that binds the surface structure together. The deep structure contains distributed memory, while the surface structure acts as the retrieval mechanism.&lt;ref name=Pribram1999/&gt; Binding occurs through the temporal synchronization of the oscillating polarizations in the synaptodendritic web. It had been thought that binding only occurred when there was no phase lead or lag present, but a study by Saul and Humphrey found that cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus do in fact produce these.&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt; Here phase lead and lag act to enhance sensory discrimination, acting as a frame to capture important features.&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt; These [[Filter (signal processing)|filters]] are also similar to the lenses necessary for holographic functioning.

==Recent studies==
While Pribram originally developed the holonomic brain theory as an analogy for certain brain processes, several papers (including some more recent ones by Pribram himself) have proposed that the similarity between hologram and certain brain functions is more than just metaphorical, but actually structural.&lt;ref name=Bokkon&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bókkon István | year = 2005 | title = Dreams and neuroholography: An interdisciplinary interpretation of development of homeotherm state in evolution | url = | journal = Sleep and Hypnosis | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 47–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Persinger&gt;{{cite journal | author = Persinger M.A., Lavallee C. | year = 2012 | title = The Σn=n Concept and the Quantitative Support for the Cerebral-Holographic and Electromagnetic Configuration of Consciousness | url = | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 128–253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others still maintain that the relationship is only analogical.&lt;ref name=Velmans&gt;{{cite journal | author = Velmans M | year = 2003 | title = Is the world in the brain, or the brain in the world? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 427–429 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x03420098}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have shown that the same series of operations used in holographic memory models are performed in certain processes concerning temporal memory and [[optomotor response]]s. This indicates at least the possibility of the existence of neurological structures with certain holonomic properties.&lt;ref name=Borsellino&gt;{{cite journal | author = Borsellino A., Poggio T. | year = 1972 | title = Holographic aspects of temporal memory and optomotor responses | url = | journal = Kybernetik | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 58–60 | doi=10.1007/bf00288785}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have demonstrated the possibility that [[biophoton]] emission (biological electrical signals that are converted to weak electromagnetic waves in the visible range) may be a necessary condition for the electric activity in the brain to store holographic images.&lt;ref name=Bokkon&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bókkon István | year = 2005 | title = Dreams and neuroholography: An interdisciplinary interpretation of development of homeotherm state in evolution | url = | journal = Sleep and Hypnosis | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 47–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These may play a role in cell communication and certain brain processes including sleep, but further studies are needed to strengthen current ones.&lt;ref name=Persinger&gt;{{cite journal | author = Persinger M.A., Lavallee C. | year = 2012 | title = The Σn=n Concept and the Quantitative Support for the Cerebral-Holographic and Electromagnetic Configuration of Consciousness | url = | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 128–253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have shown the correlation between more advanced cognitive function and [[homeothermy]]. Taking holographic brain models into account, this temperature regulation would reduce distortion of the signal waves, an important condition for holographic systems.&lt;ref name=Bokkon&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bókkon István | year = 2005 | title = Dreams and neuroholography: An interdisciplinary interpretation of development of homeotherm state in evolution | url = | journal = Sleep and Hypnosis | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 47–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and alternative models==
Pribram's holonomic model of brain function did not receive widespread attention at the time, but other quantum models developed since, including brain dynamics by Jibu &amp; Yasue and Vitiello's dissipative quantum brain dynamics. Though not directly related to the holonomic model, they continue to move beyond approaches based solely in classic brain theory.&lt;ref name=Andrew&gt;{{cite journal | author = Andrew A. M. | year = 1997 | title = The decade of the brain - further thoughts | url = | journal = Kybernetes | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 255–264 | doi=10.1108/03684929710163155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bokkon&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bókkon István | year = 2005 | title = Dreams and neuroholography: An interdisciplinary interpretation of development of homeotherm state in evolution | url = | journal = Sleep and Hypnosis | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 47–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Globus /&gt;

===Correlograph===
In 1969 scientists D. Wilshaw, O. P. Buneman and [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|H. Longuet-Higgins]] proposed an alternative, non-holographic model that fulfilled many of the same requirements as Gabor's original holographic model. The Gabor model did not explain how the brain could use Fourier analysis on incoming signals or how it would deal with the low signal-noise ratio in reconstructed memories. Longuet-Higgin's correlograph model built on the idea that any system could perform the same functions as a Fourier holograph if it could correlate pairs of patterns. It uses minute pinholes that do not produce diffraction patterns to create a similar reconstruction as that in Fourier holography.&lt;ref name=Andrew&gt;{{cite journal | author = Andrew A. M. | year = 1997 | title = The decade of the brain - further thoughts | url = | journal = Kybernetes | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 255–264 | doi=10.1108/03684929710163155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like a hologram, a discrete correlograph can recognize displaced patterns and store information in a parallel and non-local way so it usually will not be destroyed by localized damage.&lt;ref name=Willshaw&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Willshaw D. J. |author2=Buneman O. P. |author3=Longuet-Higgins H. C. | year = 1969 | title = Non-holographic associative memory | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 222 | issue = 5197| pages = 960–962 | doi=10.1038/222960a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then expanded the model beyond the correlograph to an associative net where the points become parallel lines arranged in a grid. Horizontal lines represent axons of input neurons while vertical lines represent output neurons. Each intersection represents a modifiable synapse. Though this cannot recognize displaced patterns, it has a greater potential storage capacity. This was not necessarily meant to show how the brain is organized, but instead to show the possibility of improving on Gabor's original model.&lt;ref name=Willshaw/&gt; P. Van Heerden countered this model by demonstrating mathematically that the signal-noise ratio of a hologram could reach 50% of ideal. He also used a model with a 2D neural hologram network for fast searching imposed upon a 3D network for large storage capacity. A key quality of this model was its flexibility to change the orientation and fix distortions of stored information, which is important for our ability to recognize an object as the same entity from different angles and positions, something the correlograph and association network models lack.&lt;ref name=VanHeerden&gt;{{cite journal | author = Van Heerden P. J. | year = 1970 | title = Models for the brain | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 225 | issue = 5228| pages = 177–178 | doi=10.1038/225177a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Holographic models of memory and consciousness may be related to several brain disorders involving disunity of sensory input within a unified consciousness, including [[Charles Bonnet Syndrome]], Disjunctive Agnosia, and [[Schizophrenia]]. Charles Bonnet Syndrome patients experience two vastly different worlds within one consciousness.&lt;ref name="G.G. Globus 2010"&gt;G.G. Globus; C.P. O’Carroll, "Nonlocal neurology: Beyond localization to holonomy," Irvine, April 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; They see the world that psychologically normal people perceive, but also a simplified world riddled with [[Pseudohallucination]]. These patients can differentiate these two worlds easily. Since dynamic core and global workspace theories insist that a distinct area of the brain is responsible for consciousness, the only way a patient would perceive two worlds was if this dynamic core and global workspace were split.&lt;ref name="G.G. Globus 2010"/&gt; But such does not explain how different content can be perceived within one single consciousness since these theories assume that each dynamic core or global workspace creates a single coherent reality.&lt;ref name="G.G. Globus 2010"/&gt; The primary symptom of Disjunctive Agnosia is an inconsistency of sensory information within a unified consciousness. They may see one thing, but hear something entirely incompatible with that image. Schizophrenics often report experiencing thoughts that do not seem to originate from themselves, as if the idea was inserted exogenously. The individual feels no control over certain thoughts existing within their consciousness.

{{For|the YouTube channel|HowToBasic}}
A '''how-to''' is an informal, often short, description of how to accomplish a specific task. A how-to is usually meant to help non-experts, may leave out details that are only important to experts, and may also be greatly simplified from an overall discussion of the topic.

One of the earliest how-to books was published in 1569 and entitled, ''A booke of the arte and maner, how to plant set Up intro an divers other new practise, by one of the Abbey of Saint Vincent in Fraunce'' by [[Leonard Mascall]].'' 

Perhaps the best known full-length book in the genre is ''[[How to Win Friends and Influence People]]'', written by [[Dale Carnegie]] in 1936.

A similar concept can be seen in many of the ''[topic] For Dummies'' series of tutorials and also in many other introductory surveys entitled with the suffix "[[101 (number)|101]]" (based on academic numberings of entry-level courses).

==Usage in the world of computers==
It is common practice to write the phrase as "HOWTO" in the open-source community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tldp.org/HOWTO/HOWTO-INDEX/howtos.html List of Linux HowTos], tldp.org&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the traditional naming scheme for technical documentation, such as [[FAQ]] and [[README]]. Another possible reason is that this makes it easier to find a how-to in search engines like [[Google]] as searching with the words "to" and "how" does not necessarily deliver relevant search results.&lt;ref&gt;As of 2009 A Google search for "How To" results in a comprehensive list of HowTo sites. It seems this has changed throughout the years. In the 1990s and early years of 2000, it was common for search engines to ignore these words, and even to notify the user that these words are too common for giving a comprehensive result. Currently, [https://www.google.com/help/features.html the Google features web page] says: Google ignores common words and characters such as where, the, how, and other digits and letters that slow down your search without improving the results. If a common word is essential to getting the results you want, you can make sure we pay attention to it by putting a "+" sign in front of it."&lt;/ref&gt;

How-tos have a long history as a way of sharing knowledge on the [[Internet]], but are less successful than [[FAQ]]s, manuals, [[recipe]]s and [[guide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;A search on [[Google]] for "howto faq" or for "faq howto" results in FAQs with HowTo instructions in them, but never to a single HowTo page. This is probably because FAQ pages are usually broader in scope, and therefore more commonly used.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning, most how-tos on the Internet were the result of a complex process in which an author wrote a how-to for potential readers. After 2001, [[user added content]] played a more and more important role on the internet in a trend that is widely referred to{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} as [[Web 2.0]]. This had a profound impact on the way in which how-tos are generated on the internet, as the readers and users were able to add to and improve the on-line content.

Identity-based security is an approach to control access to a digital product or service based on the authenticated identity of an individual. This allows organizations to grant access to specific users to access a variety of digital services using the same credentials, ensuring the accurate match between what users are entitled to and what they actually receive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.10duke.com/file/whitepapers/10Duke-Whitepaper-Pillars_for_effective_Personalisation.pdf |format=PDF |title=Identity and Access Management: Pillars for effective Personalisation |publisher=''10duke.com'' |date=2016-02-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705065947/http://www.10duke.com/file/whitepapers/10Duke-Whitepaper-Pillars_for_effective_Personalisation.pdf |archivedate=2017-07-05 |accessdate=2017-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while also permitting other access constraints such as company, device, location and application type ([[Attribute-based access control|attributes]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gigaom.com/report/identity-based-security-and-the-cloud/ |title= Analyst Report: Identity-based security and the cloud |last=Linthicum |first=David |publisher=[[Gigaom]] |date=2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624051107/https://gigaom.com/report/identity-based-security-and-the-cloud/ |archivedate=2016-06-24 |accessdate=2017-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Underpinning the identity-based security approach is the Identity-Based Access Control (IBAC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://csrc.nist.gov/Glossary/?term=4708 |title=Glossary: Identity-Based Access Control |work=Computer Security Resource Center |publisher=[[NIST]] |accessdate=2017-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (or identity-based licensing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.10duke.com/resources/blog/2016-02-02:What_is_identity-based_licensing%3F.html |title=What is identity-based licensing? |publisher=''10duke.com'' |date=2016-02-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114103751/http://www.10duke.com/resources/blog/2016-02-02:What_is_identity-based_licensing%3F.html |archivedate=2017-11-14 |accessdate=2017-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://help.adobe.com/en_US/fmrms/1.0.1/overview.pdf#G4.1520496 |format=PDF |title=Adobe Flash Media Rights Management Server 1.0 Overview for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and UNIX |authorlink=Adobe Systems |work=Workflows - Identity-based licensing |publisher=[[Adobe Systems]] |date=2008-05-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829230756/https://help.adobe.com/en_US/fmrms/1.0.1/overview.pdf |archivedate=2017-08-29 |accessdate=2017-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) concept.

[[NIST]] defines identity-based security policies as policies "based on the identities and/or attributes of the object (system resource) being accessed and of the subject (user, group of users, process, or device) requesting access."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-33.pdf SP 800-33 - Underlying Technical Models for Information Technology Security], Gary Stoneburner, p. 21, December 2001, ''NIST Computer Security Publications - NIST Special Publications (SPs)'', [[doi:10.6028/NIST.SP.800-33]]. Retrieved 4 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the advantages of the identity-based security approach include the ability to exercise very fine-grained control over who is allowed to use which services and which functions those users can perform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=102217 |title=.NET Identity and Principal Objects |last=Enrico |first=Sabbadin |work=informIT |publisher=[[Pearson Education]] |date=2003-12-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114114047/http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=102217 |archivedate=2017-11-14 |accessdate=2017-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is device-agnostic, offering the possibility to enforce access control policy across a variety of devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and PCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://esj.com/Articles/2012/07/16/BYOD-and-Identity-Based-Security.aspx?Page=2 |title=Q&amp;A: Addressing BYOD with Identity-Based Security |last=Powell |first=James E. |publisher=Enterprise Systems Journal |date=2012-07-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114113119/https://esj.com/articles/2012/07/16/byod-and-identity-based-security.aspx |archivedate=2017-11-14 |accessdate=2017-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Identity-based security models ==

=== Cyberoam’s approach ===

The identity-based security network security approach put forward by [[Cyberoam]] includes security components that provides visibility and control over user activity in a particular [[Computer network|network]]. It offers a network security system which includes a user's [[identity management|human identity]] as a part of the [[firewall (computer)|firewall]] rule matching criteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberoam.com/downloads/Whitepaper/CyberoamLayer8Technology.pdf  Identity based security], ''cyberoam.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept includes treating a user's identity as the 8th Layer (also known as the human layer{{cn|date=November 2017}}) in the [[Protocol_stack|network protocol stack]], thus attaching user identity to security while authenticating, authorizing and auditing the network. This takes a different step from conventional security appliances, which bind security to [[IP address|IP-address]]es. Such an approach allows organisations to create [[computer security policy|security policies]] that align to users and groups rather than to IP addresses which ultimately gives them more precise control over who can access the network—and what they can access.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/routers/800-series-routers/at_a_glance_c45-675579.pdf Identity-Based Firewall Security], ''cisco.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Identity-based security prevents systems against address [[IP address spoofing|spoofing]] attacks by combining the point of [[encryption]], [[authentication]], and [[access control]] into a single unit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arubanetworks.com/pdf/solutions/identity-based-security.pdf Identity-Based Security], ''arubanetworks.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''inhabited initial''' is an [[initial]], an enlarged [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] at the beginning of a paragraph or other section of text that contains an illustration of human or animal figures within the letter. It is similar to a [[historiated initial]]; however, the figures in historiated initials show an identifiable scene or story, while the figures in inhabited initials do not show a narrative.&lt;ref name="bluk-glosI" /&gt; Figures in inhabited initials may be related to the contents of the text, but do not have to be.

The '''Institute for Mathematics and its Applications''' located at the [[University of Minnesota]] is an organization established in 1982 by the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) of the United States.  

==Mission==
The primary mission of the IMA is to increase the impact of mathematics by fostering interdisciplinary research and linking mathematics  and scientific and technological problems from other disciplines and industry.

==Activities==
The IMA hosts long-term visitors, funds [[postdoctoral research]] positions, and holds several conferences annually. The NSF has granted the IMA $19.5 million over the period 2005&amp;ndash;2010, the largest single mathematics grant the NSF has ever awarded.

The '''Institute of Economic Affairs''' ('''IEA''') is a non-profit, [[right-wing libertarian]] [[think tank]] based in [[Westminster]], London, United Kingdom. Founded by businessman and [[battery farming]] pioneer [[Antony Fisher]] in 1955, it promotes [[free market]] economics. There has been discussion in the press and among parliamentarians as to whether the IEA is more accurately described as a [[lobbying]] operation than as a think tank.&lt;ref name=obs11nov18&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/11/brexit-whistleblower-shahmir-sanni-taxpayers-alliance-concedes-it-launched-smears|title=TaxPayers' Alliance concedes it launched smears against Brexit whistleblower|last=Cadwalladr|first=Carole|date=11 November 2018|newspaper=The Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It publishes a magazine, books, and holds lectures regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/brexitinc/adam-ramsay-peter-geoghegan/right-wing-think-tank-accused-of-promoting-tobacco-oil-indu|title=Right-wing think tank accused of promoting tobacco and oil industry “propaganda” in schools|last1=Ramsay|first1=Adam|last2=Geoghegan|first2=Peter|date=28 November 2018|publisher=openDemocracy|accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1945, [[Antony Fisher]] read a summary of ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' by [[Friedrich Hayek]].&lt;ref name="ieachronology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org.uk/sites/default/files/Chronology.pdf|title=IEA: Chronology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Fisher visited Hayek at the London School of Economics.  Hayek dissuaded Fisher from embarking on a political and parliamentary career to try to prevent the spread of socialism and [[central planning]].&lt;ref name="ieachronology"/&gt; Instead, Hayek suggested the establishment of a body which could engage in research and reach the intellectuals with reasoned argument.&lt;ref name="ieachronology"/&gt;

In June 1955, ''The Free Convertibility of Sterling'' by George Winder was published, with Fisher signing the foreword as Director of the IEA.&lt;ref name="ieachronology"/&gt; In November 1955, the IEA's Original Trust Deed was signed by Fisher, John Harding and [[Oliver Smedley]]. [[Ralph Harris, Baron Harris of High Cross|Ralph Harris]] (later Lord Harris) began work as part-time General Director in January 1957.&lt;ref name="ieachronology"/&gt; He was joined in 1958 by [[Arthur Seldon]] who was initially appointed Editorial Advisor and became the Editorial Director in 1959.&lt;ref name="ieachronology"/&gt; Smedley wrote to Fisher that it was &lt;blockquote&gt;"imperative that we should give no indication in our literature that we are working to educate the public along certain lines which might be interpreted as having a political bias. … That is why the first draft [of the IEA’s aims] is written in rather cagey terms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/entries/fdb484c8-99a1-32a3-83be-20108374b985 |title=THE CURSE OF TINA |website=BBC |date=13 September 2011  |author=Adam Curtis |accessdate= 18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Social Affairs Unit]] was established in December 1980 as an offshoot of the Institute of Economic Affairs to carry the IEA's economic ideas onto the battleground of sociology.&lt;ref name=Muller/&gt; "Within a few years the Social Affairs Unit became independent from the IEA, acquiring its own premises."&lt;ref name=Muller&gt;{{cite journal |last=Muller |first=Christopher |title=The Institute of Economic Affairs: Undermining the Post-War Consensus |journal=Contemporary British History |volume=10 |issue=1 |year=1996 |pages=88–110 [p. 102] |doi=10.1080/13619469608581370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 the IEA created a Health and Welfare Unit to focus on these aspects of social policy.&lt;ref name="ieachronology"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Muller/&gt; Discussing the IEA's increasing influence under the Conservative government in the 1980s in relation to the "advent of Thatcherism" and the promotion of privatisation, Dieter Plehwe, a Research Fellow at the [[WZB Berlin Social Science Center]], has written that&lt;blockquote&gt;The arguably most influential think tank in British history... benefited from the close alignment of IEA's [[neoliberal]] agenda with [[corporatocracy|corporate interests]] and the priorities of the Thatcher government.&lt;ref&gt;Academic Identities – Academic Challenges? American and European Experience of the Transformation of Higher Education and Research, Dieter Plehwe, Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2011, pp. 172–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2007, British journalist [[Andrew Marr]] called the IEA "undoubtedly the most influential think tank in modern British history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=New Britannia|series=[[Andrew Marr's History of Modern Britain]]|publisher=[[BBC One]]|episode=5|airdate=19 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damien Cahill, a Professor of Political Economy at the [[University of Sydney]], has characterised the IEA as, "Britain's oldest and leading neoliberal think tank".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=GKAiBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=%22Institute+of+Economic+Affairs%22,+%22neoliberal+think+tank%22&amp;hl=ja&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=If52VeO2Oui5mAWj1IPQAQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Institute%20of%20Economic%20Affairs%22%2C%20%22neoliberal%20think%20tank%22&amp;f=false The End of Laissez-Faire?: On the Durability of Embedded Neoliberalism] Damien Cahill, Edward Elgar Pub, 2014, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, the IEA appointed Mark Littlewood as its Director General with effect from 1 December 2009.&lt;ref name="cherwell"&gt;Robert Walmsley, [http://www.cherwell.org/comment/interviews/2014/01/25/interview-mark-littlewood Interview: Mark Littlewood], ''[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]]'', 26 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose and aims==
It is not known what the IEA actually is, or on whose behalf it speaks, or how it is funded. It is rated by the accountability group Transparify&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transparify.org/ |title=Transparify |website=Transparify.org |date=17 July 2018  |author= |accessdate= 18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "highly opaque". &lt;ref name=graun18jl18/&gt;

It has supported legislation banning charities receiving public funds from lobbying the government (this does not affect IEA itself; as a registered educational charity it is exempt from many taxes, but its funding is private). Charity Commission rules state that "an organisation will not be charitable if its purposes are political". In July 2018 the Charity Commission announced that it was to investigate whether the IEA had broken its rules.&lt;ref name=graun18jl18/&gt;

Since Britain voted to leave the [[European Union]] ([[Brexit]]) by March 2019, the IEA has lobbied consistently for a [[Brexit#Hard and soft Brexit|hard Brexit]] without customs and regulatory alignment, etc.; a report it published in July 2018 proposed using Brexit to remove rules protecting agency workers, to deregulate finance, annul the rules on hazardous chemicals and weaken food labelling laws.&lt;ref name=graun18jl18/&gt;

The IEA supports privatising the [[National Health Service]] (NHS); campaigns against controls on junk food; attacks trades unions; and defends [[zero-hour contract]]s, unpaid internships and tax havens.&lt;ref name=graun18jl18/&gt; Its staff frequently appear on BBC television promoting these positions.

Its director Mark Littlewood said "We want to totally reframe the debate about the proper role of the state and civil society in our country … Our true mission is to change the climate of opinion."&lt;ref name=graun18jl18/&gt;
===Concerns about political independence; investigation===

[[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], [[Steve Baker (politician)|Steve Baker]] and [[Martin Callanan|Lord Callanan]], ministers at the [[Department for Exiting the European Union]] (DExEU) at the time, all recorded meetings with the IEA in the first three months of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/720640/-DExEU_Ministers_Quarterly_Return_Q417.xlsx_-_Meetings.csv_-_COMPLETE_2018-12-06_DExEU_Ministers_Quarterly_Return_Q417.xlsx_-_Meetings.csv.csv/preview |title=Ministerial meetings, January to March 2018|website=UK Government, Department for Exiting the European Union  |author= |date= 28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''The Observer'' reported on 29 July 2018 that the director of the IEA was secretly recorded in May and June telling an undercover reporter that funders could get to know ministers on first-name terms and that his organisation was in "the Brexit influencing game". While seeking funding, Littlewood said that the IEA allowed donors to affect the "salience" of reports and to shape "substantial content". The recording was to be given to the Charity Commission on 30 July.&lt;ref name=obs29jul18&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/29/rightwing-thinktank-ministerial-access-potential-us-donors-insitute-of-economic-affairs-brexit |title=Rightwing UK thinktank 'offered ministerial access' to potential US donors |newspaper=The Observer|author= Robert Booth|date= 29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charity Commission, considering that the allegations raised by the recordings were “of a serious nature”, on 20 July 2018  opened a regulatory compliance case into the IEA due to concerns about its political independence, after it became known that it offered potential US donors access to ministers while raising funds for research to promote free-trade deals favoured by proponents of a "hard Brexit". The Commission has powers to examine IEA financial records, legally compel it to provide information, and to disqualify trustees. The IEA denies it has breached charity law.&lt;ref name=graun30jl18&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/30/labour-calls-for-inquiry-into-iea-thinktank-over-cash-for-access-claims |title=Thinktank faces double investigation after 'cash for access' claims |newspaper=The Guardian|author=Robert Booth and  Rajeev Syal|date= 30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lobbying in the United Kingdom#Regulation|register of lobbyists]] was also considering whether the IEA should be registered. It was also revealed that, after the IEA published a report recommending more [[casino]]s, the casino industry donated £8,000 to the IEA.&lt;ref name=graun30jl18/&gt;

[[Jon Trickett]], the [[Shadow Cabinet|shadow]] [[Cabinet Office]] minister, welcoming the investigation into the IEA, said "on the road to Brexit, a small group of establishment figures, funded to the tune of millions, are covertly pursuing a political campaign in favour of extreme free trade, acting in effect as lobbyists for secretive corporate interests. ... there are serious questions that high-ranking Conservative ministers must now answer about their dealings with the IEA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/31/charity-commission-investigation-institute-economic-affairs |title=This thinktank scandal is another sign that our democracy is under attack |newspaper=The Guardian |author=Jon Trickett |date= 31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also revealed that Jersey Finance, representing financial interests in [[Jersey]], paid for an IEA report saying that  tax havens (such as Jersey) benefited the wider economy, and did not diminish tax  revenues in other countries. The report recommended that their status be protected. The IEA did not disclose the funding from Jersey Finance. A similar IEA report about neighbouring [[Guernsey]] was funded by the financial services industry there. Following these revelations, the IEA said that funding they received never influenced the conclusions of reports, and that their output was independent and free from conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/31/jersey-finance-paid-iea-to-trash-hotbeds-of-tax-evasion-claims |title=Jersey Finance paid for IEA report rubbishing 'hotbeds of tax evasion' claims |newspaper=The Guardian |author=Robert Booth and  David Pegg|date= 31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The IEA is a registered educational and research charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|235351|The Institute of Economic Affairs Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation states that it is entirely funded by "voluntary donations from individuals, companies and foundations who want to support its work, plus income from book sales and conferences"&lt;ref name=IEA-about /&gt; and that it is "independent of any political party or group".&lt;ref name=IEA-about /&gt; The IEA's sources of funding are not known, except that there has been long-term funding by [[British American Tobacco]] (BAT), [[Japan Tobacco International]], [[Imperial Tobacco]] and [[Philip Morris International]].&lt;ref name=graun18jl18/&gt; The IEA has written policy papers arguing against government funding for pressure groups and charities involved in political campaigning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Snowden|first1=Christopher|title=Sock Puppets: How the government lobbies itself and why|url=http://www.iea.org.uk/publications/research/sock-puppets-how-the-government-lobbies-itself-and-why|publisher=IEA Discussion Paper 39|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding from multinational tobacco, alcohol and food corporations===
The IEA does not disclose their sources of funding but has been criticised by health charities and ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;ref name=graun18jl18&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/18/dark-money-democracy-political-crisis-institute-economic-affairs |title=Dark money lurks at the heart of our political crisis |newspaper=The Guardian |author=George Monbiot |date= 18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for receiving funds from major tobacco companies whilst campaigning on tobacco related issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/15/cigarette-packaging-corporate-smokescreen-liberty | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Cigarette packaging: the corporate smokescreen}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[British American Tobacco]] confirmed it had donated £40,000 to the IEA in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British American Tobacco's response to ASH – June 2014|url=http://www.bat.com/group/sites/uk__9d9kcy.nsf/vwPagesWebLive/DO9DLM9T/$FILE/medMD9KSF99.pdf?openelement|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; £20,000 in 2012 and £10,000 in 2011 and [[Philip Morris International]] and [[Japan Tobacco International]] also confirmed they had provided financial support to the IEA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jun/01/thinktanks-big-tobacco-funds-smoking Health groups dismayed by news 'big tobacco' funded rightwing thinktanks], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 1 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 a leaked letter revealed that prominent IEA member, the conservative writer [[Roger Scruton]], had authored an IEA pamphlet attacking the World Health Organisation's campaign on tobacco, whilst failing to disclose that he was receiving £54,000 a year from Japan Tobacco International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/jan/24/advertising.tobaccoadvertising | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Scruton in media plot to promote smoking}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bmj"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pro-tobacco writer admits he should have declared an interest|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/324/7332/257.1.full|website=British Medical Journal|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response the IEA said it would introduce an author declaration policy.&lt;ref name="bmj" /&gt; The IEA says that it "accepts no tied funding".&lt;ref name="peer review"&gt;{{cite web|title=Peer Review Protocol|url=https://iea.org.uk/peer-review-protocal/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201175327/http://www.iea.org.uk:80/publications/peer-review-protocol|archive-date=1 February 2016|dead-url=no|website=IEA|access-date=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An organisation called 'American Friends of the IEA' had received $215,000 as of 2010 from the US-based [[Donors Trust]] and [[Donors Capital Fund]], [[donor-advised fund]]s which support right-wing libertarian causes.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/18/charities-pr-rightwing-ultra-rich | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=The educational charities that do PR for the rightwing ultra-rich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Think tank [[Transparify]], which is funded by the [[Open Society Foundations]], ranked the IEA as one of the three least transparent think tanks in the UK in relation to funding.&lt;ref name="sarahneville"&gt;Sarah Neville, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ae6968c4-b5ec-11e4-b58d-00144feab7de.html#axzz3SekS8nmf British think-tanks ‘less transparent about sources of funding’], ''Financial Times'', 17 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=t2015 /&gt; The IEA responded by saying "...It is a matter for individual donors whether they wish their donation to be public or private – we leave that entirely to their discretion.", and that it has not "...earmarked money for commissioned research work from any company".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neville|first1=Sarah|title=British think-tanks 'less transparent about sources of funding'|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ae6968c4-b5ec-11e4-b58d-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=uk|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding to the IEA from the alcohol industry, food industry, and sugar industry has also been documented.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Impact of Market Forces on Addictive Substances and Behaviours: The web of influence of addictive industries.|last=Miller|first=David|last2=Harkins|first2=Claire|last3=Schlögl|first3=Matthias|last4=Montague|first4=Brendan|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780198753261|location=Oxford|pages=102-108}}&lt;/ref&gt; IEA Research Fellow [[Christopher Snowdon]] disclosed alcohol industry funding in a response to a British Medical Journal article in 2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Publications==

Arthur Seldon proposed a series of Papers for economists to explore the market approach to the issues of the day.&lt;ref name="ieachronology"/&gt; Eventually these emerged as the Hobart Papers; 154 had been published by August 2006. In addition, 32 Hobart Paperbacks had been released along with 139 Occasional Papers, 61 Readings and 61 Research Monographs.&lt;ref name="ieachronology"/&gt; A large number of other titles has been published in association with trade and university presses.&lt;ref name="ieachronology"/&gt;

''The Journal of Economic Affairs'' was first published in October 1980 and continues to be published to the present day. IEA publications are sold throughout the world – reprinted and translated into over twenty-five languages. In the UK, many IEA titles have become mandatory in university and classroom reading lists.&lt;ref name="IEA-about"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.iea.org.uk/about|title = about the IEA|publisher = Institute of Economic Affairs|accessdate = 29 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IEA papers are arranged in a series of titles, each with its own 'brand image'. The main series of publications is complemented by the IEA's quarterly journal ''Economic Affairs''.

In September 2008, the institute started the IEA blog.

===Research===
According to the IEA, although not an academic body, the institute's research activities are aided by an international Academic Advisory Council and a panel of Honorary Fellows. The IEA say that their papers are subjected to the same refereeing process used by academic journals&lt;ref name="peer review" /&gt;, and that the views expressed in IEA papers are those of the authors and not of the IEA, its trustees, directors or advisers.

The IEA has also published research in areas including  business ethics, economic development, education, pensions, regulation, taxation and transport.

'''Internet linguistics''' is a domain of [[linguistics]] advocated by the English linguist [[David Crystal]]. It studies new language styles and forms that have arisen under the influence of the [[Internet]] and of other [[new media]], such as [[Short Message Service]] (SMS) [[text messaging]].&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the beginning of [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI) leading to [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) and Internet-mediated communication (IMC), experts{{who?|date=May 2018}} have acknowledged that linguistics has a contributing role in it, in terms of web interface and usability. Studying the emerging language on the Internet can help improve conceptual organization, translation and web usability. Such study aims to benefit both linguists and web users.&lt;ref name=" Linguistics and web usability "&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of Internet linguistics can take place through four main perspectives: [[#socp|sociolinguistics]], [[#ep|education]], [[#sp|stylistics]] and [[#ap|applied]] linguistics.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope"/&gt; Further dimensions have developed as a result of further technological advances - which include the development of the Web as [[text corpus | corpus]] and the spread and influence of the stylistic variations brought forth by the spread of the Internet, through the [[mass media]] and through [[literary works]]. In view of the increasing number of users connected to the Internet, the linguistics future of the Internet remains to be determined, as new computer-mediated technologies continue to emerge and people adapt their languages to suit these new media.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt; The Internet continues to play a significant role both in encouraging as well as in diverting attention away from the usage of languages.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Minority Languages, Multimedia and the Web"/&gt;

==Main perspectives==

David Crystal has identified four main perspectives for further investigation – the sociolinguistic perspective, the educational perspective, the stylistic perspective and the applied perspective.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; The four perspectives are effectively interlinked and affect one another.

=== {{anchor|socp}}Sociolinguistic perspective ===
This perspective deals with how society views the impact of Internet development on languages.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; The advent of the Internet has revolutionized communication in many ways; it changed the way people communicate and created new platforms with far-reaching social impact. Significant avenues include but are not limited to SMS text messaging, [[e-mails]], [[Online chat|chatgroups]], [[virtual worlds]] and the Web.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt;

The evolution of these new mediums of communications has raised much concern with regards to the way language is being used. According to Crystal (2005), these concerns are neither without grounds nor unseen in history – it surfaces almost always when a new technology breakthrough influences languages; as seen in the 15th century when [[printing]] was introduced, the 19th century when the [[telephone]] was invented and the 20th century when [[broadcasting]] began to penetrate our society.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt;

At a personal level, CMC such as SMS Text Messaging and mobile e-mailing ([[push mail]]) has greatly enhanced instantaneous communication.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; Some examples include the [[iPhone]] and the [[BlackBerry]].

In schools, it is not uncommon for educators and students to be given personalized school e-mail accounts for communication and interaction purposes.  Classroom discussions are increasingly being brought onto the Internet in the form of discussion forums. For instance, at [[Nanyang Technological University]], students engage in collaborative learning at the university’s portal – edveNTUre, where they participate in discussions on forums and online quizzes and view streaming podcasts prepared by their course instructors among others. [[iTunes U]] in 2008 began to collaborate with universities as they converted the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] music service into a store that makes available academic lectures and scholastic materials for free – they have partnered more than 600 institutions in 18 countries including [[Oxford University|Oxford]], [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] and [[Yale University|Yale]] Universities.&lt;ref name="iPhone takes on BlackBerry"&gt;{{Cite news

| newspaper = [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]
| date = 7 March 2008
| accessdate = 2010-10-31}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

These forms of academic social networking and media are slated to rise as educators from all over the world continue to seek new ways to better engage students. It is commonplace for students in [[New York University]] to interact with “guest speakers weighing in via [[Skype]], library staffs providing support via [[instant messaging]], and students accessing library resources from off campus.”&lt;ref name="Universities Use Social Media to Connect"&gt;{{Cite news
| title = Universities Use Social Media to Connect
| first = Peter
| last = Cohen
| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/31/education/31iht-riedsoc.html?_r=1
| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]
| date = 30 March 2010
| accessdate = 2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will affect the way language is used as students and teachers begin to use more of these CMC platforms.&lt;ref name="Universities Use Social Media to Connect"/&gt;

At a professional level, it is a common sight for companies to have their computers and laptops hooked up onto the Internet (via wired and wireless [[Internet connection]]), and for employees to have individual e-mail accounts. This greatly facilitates internal (among staffs of the company) and external (with other parties outside of one’s organization) communication. Mobile communications such as [[smart phones]] are increasingly making their way into the corporate world. For instance, in 2008, Apple announced their intention to actively step up their efforts to help companies incorporate the iPhone into their enterprise environment, facilitated by technological developments in streamlining integrated features (push e-mail, calendar and contact management) using [[ActiveSync]].&lt;ref name="iPhone takes on BlackBerry" /&gt;

In general, these new CMCs that are made possible by the Internet have altered the way people use language – there is heightened informality and consequently a growing fear of its deterioration. However, as David Crystal puts it, these should be seen positively as it reflects the power of the creativity of a language.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt;

====Themes====

The sociolinguistics of the Internet may also be examined through five interconnected themes.&lt;ref name="Thurlow"&gt;{{cite book

# [[Multilingualism]] – It looks at the prevalence and status of various languages on the Internet.
# [[Language change]] – From a sociolinguistic perspective, language change is influenced by the physical constraints of technology (e.g. typed text) and the shifting social-economic priorities such as globalization. It explores the linguistic changes over time, with emphasis on [[Internet lingo]].
# [[Conversation analysis|Conversation discourse]] – It explores the changes in patterns of social interaction and communicative practice on the Internet.
# Stylistic diffusion – It involves the study of the spread of Internet jargons and related linguistic forms into common usage. As language changes, conversation discourse and stylistic diffusion overlap with the aspect of language stylistics.
#:''See below: [[#sp|Stylistic perspective]]''
# [[Metalanguage]] and [[folk linguistics]] – It involves looking at the way these linguistic forms and changes on the Internet are labelled and discussed (e.g. impact of Internet lingo resulted in the 'death' of the apostrophe and loss of capitalization.)

==={{anchor|ep}}Educational perspective===
The educational perspective of internet linguistics examines the Internet's impact on [[formal language]] use, specifically on [[Standard English]], which in turn affects [[language education]].&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; The rise and rapid spread of Internet use has brought about new linguistic features specific only to the Internet platform. These include, but are not limited to, an increase in the use of informal written language, inconsistency in written styles and [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]] and the use of new abbreviations in Internet chats and SMS text messaging, where constraints of technology on word count contributed to the rise of new abbreviations.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; Such [[acronyms]] exist primarily for practical reasons — to reduce the time and effort required to communicate through these mediums apart from technological limitations. Examples of common acronyms include ''[[lol]]'' (for laughing out loud; a general expression of laughter), ''[[SMS language#Common abbreviations|omg]]'' (oh my god) and ''gtg'' (got to go).&lt;ref name="The Influence of Internet on Language and Email Stress"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The educational perspective has been considerably established in the research on the Internet's impact on language education. It is an important and crucial aspect as it affects and involves the education of current and future student generations in the appropriate and timely use of informal language that arises from [[Internet usage]]. There are concerns for the growing infiltration of informal language use and incorrect word use into academic or formal situations, such as the usage of casual words like "guy" or the choice of the word "preclude" in place of "precede" in academic papers by students. There are also issues with spellings and grammar occurring at a higher frequency among students' academic works as noted by educators, with the use of abbreviations such as "u" for "you" and "2" for "to" being the most common.&lt;ref name="No LOL Matter: Cyber lingo shows up in academia"&gt;{{cite news

| last = Hayslett

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists and professors like Eleanor Johnson suspect that widespread mistakes in writing are strongly connected to Internet usage, where educators have similarly reported new kinds of spelling and grammar mistakes in student works. There is, however, no [[scientific evidence]] to confirm the proposed connection.&lt;ref name="Experts divided over Internet changes to Language"&gt;{{cite news

| first = Rachel
| last = Abrams
| publisher = [[Voanews.com|VOANews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there are valid concerns about Internet usage and its impact on students' academic and formal writing, its severity is however enlarged by the informal nature of the new media platforms. [[Naomi Baron|Naomi S. Baron]] (2008)  argues in ''Always On'' that student writings suffer little impact from the use of Internet-mediated communication (IMC) such as internet chat, SMS text messaging and e-mail.&lt;ref name="Always On"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 2009 published by the [[British Psychological Society|British Journal of Developmental Psychology]] found that students who regularly texted (sent messages via SMS using a mobile phone) displayed a wider range of vocabulary and this may lead to a positive impact on their reading development.&lt;ref name="Texting improves language skill"&gt;{{cite news

| publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the use of the Internet resulted in stylistics that are not deemed appropriate in academic and formal language use, it is to be noted that Internet use may not hinder language education but instead aid it. The Internet has proven in different ways that it can provide potential benefits in enhancing language learning, especially in second or [[Foreign language teaching|foreign language learning]]. Language education through the Internet in relation to Internet linguisitics is, most significantly, applied through the communication aspect (use of e-mails, [[discussion forums]], [[Instant messaging|chat messengers]], [[blog]]s, etc.).&lt;ref name="Globalization and Language Education"&gt;{{cite web

| title = Globalization and Language Education

| work = Presentation
| first = Tim
| last = Xie}}&lt;/ref&gt;
IMC allows for greater interaction between language learners and native speakers of the language, providing for greater error corrections and better learning opportunities of standard language, in the process allowing the picking up of specific skills such as negotiation and persuasion.&lt;ref name="Globalization and Language Education"/&gt;

==={{anchor|sp}}Stylistic perspective===
This perspective examines how the Internet and its related technologies have encouraged new and different forms of creativity in language, especially in literature.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; It looks at the Internet as a medium through which new language phenomena have arisen. This new mode of language is interesting to study because it is an amalgam of both spoken and written languages. For example, traditional writing is static compared to the dynamic nature of the new language on the Internet where words can appear in different colors and font sizes on the computer screen.&lt;ref name=" Linguists See Internet Lingo as Cultural Catalyst "&gt;{{Cite news

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, this new mode of language also contains other elements not found in natural languages. One example is the concept of framing found in e-mails and discussion forums. In replying to e-mails, people generally use the sender’s e-mail message as a frame to write their own messages. They can choose to respond to certain parts of an e-mail message while leaving other bits out. In discussion forums, one can start a new thread and anyone regardless of their physical location can respond to the idea or thought that was set down through the Internet. This is something that is usually not found in written language.&lt;ref name=" Linguists See Internet Lingo as Cultural Catalyst"/&gt;

Future research also includes new varieties of expressions that the Internet and its various technologies are constantly producing and their effects not only on written languages but also their spoken forms.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; The communicative style of Internet language is best observed in the CMC channels below, as there are often attempts to overcome technological restraints such as transmission time lags and to re-establish social cues that are often vague in written text.&lt;ref name="Thurlow"/&gt;

====Mobile phones====
{{see also|mobile phone}}
Mobile phones (also called "cell phones") have an expressive potential beyond their basic communicative functions. This can be seen in text-messaging poetry competitions such as the one held by [[The Guardian]].&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; The 160-character limit imposed by the cell phone has motivated users to exercise their linguistic creativity to overcome them.  A similar example of new technology with character constraints is [[Twitter]], which has a 280-character limit.  There have been debates as to whether these new abbreviated forms introduced in users’ [[wikt:Special:Search/tweet|Tweet]]s are "lazy" or whether they are creative fragments of communication. Despite the ongoing debate, there is no doubt that Twitter has contributed to the linguistic landscape with new lingoes and also brought about a new dimension of communication.&lt;ref name=" From Telegraph to Twitter: The Language of the Short Form "&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cell phone has also created a new literary genre – [[cell phone novels]]. A typical cell phone novel consists of several chapters which readers download in short installments. These novels are in their "raw" form as they do not go through editing processes like traditional novels. They are written in short sentences, similar to text-messaging.&lt;ref name="Thumbs Race as Japan’s Best Sellers Go Cellular"&gt;{{Cite news

| accessdate = 2010-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Authors of such novels are also able to receive feedbacks and new ideas from their readers through e-mails or online feedback channels. Unlike traditional novel writing, readers’ ideas sometimes get incorporated into the storyline or authors may also decide to change their story’s plot according to the demand and popularity of their novel (typically gauged by the number of download hits).&lt;ref name="Cell Phones Put to Novel Use"&gt;{{cite news

====Blogs====

Blogging has brought about new ways of writing diaries and from a linguistic perspective, the language used in blogs is "in its most 'naked' form",&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; published for the world to see without undergoing the formal editing process. This is what makes blogs stand out because almost all other forms of printed language have gone through some form of editing and standardization.&lt;ref name="Language and the Internet"&gt;{{cite book |last=Crystal |first=David

These developments in interactive blogging have created new linguistic conventions and styles, with more expected to arise in the future.&lt;ref name="Language and the Internet"/&gt;

====Virtual worlds====
{{see also|virtual worlds}}

Virtual worlds provide insights into how users are adapting the usage of natural language for communication within these new mediums. The Internet language that has arisen through user interactions in text-based chatrooms and [[computer-simulated]] worlds has led to the development of slangs within digital communities. Examples of these include [[pwn]] and [[noob]]. [[Emoticons]] are further examples of how users have adapted different expressions to suit the limitations of cyberspace communication, one of which is the "loss of emotivity".&lt;ref name="On The Linguistic Nature of Cyberspace and Virtual Communities"&gt;{{cite journal

Communication in niches such as [[role-playing game]]s (RPG) of [[MUDs|Multi-User domains]] (MUDs) and virtual worlds is highly interactive, with emphasis on speed, brevity and spontaneity.  As a result, CMC is generally more vibrant, volatile, unstructured and open. There are often complex organization of sequences and exchange structures evident in the connection of conversational strands and short turns. Some of the CMC strategies used include capitalization for words such as ''EMPHASIS'', usage of symbols such as the asterisk to enclose words as seen in ''*stress*'' and the creative use of punctuation like ''???!?!?!?''.&lt;ref name="Thurlow"/&gt; Symbols are also used for discourse functions, such as the asterisk as a [[Conversation analysis#Repair|conversational repair]] marker and arrows and carats as [[deixis]] and [[referent]] markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collister|first=Lauren B.|date=2012-03-01|title=The discourse deictics ∧ and &lt;-- in a World of Warcraft community|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211695812000050|journal=Discourse, Context &amp; Media|volume=1|issue=1|pages=9–19|doi=10.1016/j.dcm.2012.05.002|archive-url=http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/17348/|archive-date=21 Feb 2013}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collister|first=Lauren Brittany|date=2011-02-01|title=*-repair in Online Discourse|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216610003152|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|series=The Language of Space and Time|volume=43|issue=3|pages=918–921|doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.09.025|archive-url=http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/20621/|archive-date=21 Feb 2014}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides contributing to these new forms in language, virtual worlds are also being used to teach languages. [[Virtual world language learning]] provides students with simulations of real-life environments, allowing them to find creative ways to improve their language skills. Virtual worlds are good tools for language learning among the younger learners because they already see such places as a "natural place to learn and play".&lt;ref name=" Language Teaching Gains Second Life: Virtual Worlds Offer New Methods to Teach Languages "&gt;{{Cite press release

====E-mail====
{{See also|email}}

One of the most popular Internet-related technologies to be studied under this perspective is e-mail, which has expanded the stylistics of languages in many ways. A study done on the linguistic profile of e-mails has shown that there is a hybrid of speech and writing styles in terms of format, grammar and style.&lt;ref name="baron"&gt;{{cite journal

| accessdate = 2010-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often related to informality as it feels temporary and can be deleted easily. However, as this medium of communication matures, e-mail is no longer confined to sending informal messages between friends and relatives. Instead, business correspondences are increasingly being carried out through e-mails. Job seekers are also using e-mails to send their resumes to potential employers. The result of a move towards more formal usages will be a medium representing a range of formal and informal stylistics.&lt;ref name="Language and the Internet"/&gt;

While e-mail has been blamed for students’ increased usage of informal language in their written work, David Crystal argues that e-mail is "not a threat, for language education" because e-mail with its array of stylistic expressiveness can act as a domain for language learners to make their own linguistic choices responsibly. Furthermore, the younger generation’s high propensity for using e-mail may improve their writing and communication skills because of the efforts they are making to formulate their thoughts and ideas, albeit through a digital medium.&lt;ref name=" Say so long to traditional letter writing "/&gt;

====Instant messaging====
{{See also|instant messaging}}

Like other forms of online communication, instant messaging has also developed its own acronyms and short forms. However, instant messaging is quite different from e-mail and chatgroups because it allows participants to interact with one another in real-time while conversing in private.&lt;ref name="7 things you should know about…Instant Messaging "&gt;{{Cite journal
| title = 7 Things You Should Know About Instant Messaging

This increased degree of intimacy allows greater informality in language and "typographical idiosyncrasies". There are also greater occurrences of stylistic variation because there can be a very wide age gap between participants. For example, a granddaughter can catch up with her grandmother through instant messaging. Unlike chatgroups where participants come together with shared interests, there is no pressure to conform in language here.&lt;ref name="Language and the Internet"/&gt;

==={{anchor|ap}}Applied perspective===
[[File:Language on internet.JPG|thumb|alt=|Source: [http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm Internet World Stats]]]
The applied perspective views the linguistic exploitation of the Internet in terms of its communicative capabilities – the good and the bad.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; The Internet provides a platform where users can experience multilingualism. Although English is still the dominant language used on the Internet, other languages are gradually increasing in their number of users.&lt;ref name="Thurlow" /&gt; The [[Global Internet usage]] page provides some information on the number of users of the Internet by language, nationality and geography. This multilingual environment continues to increase in diversity as more language communities become connected to the Internet. The Internet is thus a platform where minority and [[endangered language]]s can seek to revive their language use and/or create awareness. This can be seen in two instances where it provides these languages opportunities for progress in two important regards - [[language documentation]] and [[language revitalization]].&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt;

====Language documentation====
{{See also|Language documentation}}
Firstly, the Internet facilitates language documentation. Digital archives of media such as audio and video recordings not only help to preserve language documentation, but also allows for global dissemination through the Internet.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publicity about endangered languages, such as Webster (2003) has helped to spur a worldwide interest in linguistic documentation.

Foundations such as the Hans Rausing Endangered Languages Project (HRELP), funded by Arcadia also help to develop the interest in linguistic documentation. The HRELP is a project that seeks to document endangered languages, preserve and disseminate documentation materials among others. The materials gathered are made available online under its Endangered Languages Archive (ELAR) program.

Other online materials that support language documentation include the Language Archive Newsletter which provides news and articles about topics in endangered languages. The web version of Ethnologue also provides brief information of all of the world’s known living languages. By making resources and information of endangered languages and language documentation available on the Internet, it allows researchers to build on these materials and hence preserve endangered languages.

====Language revitalization====
{{See also|language revitalization}}

Secondly, the Internet facilitates language revitalization. Throughout the years, the digital environment has developed in various sophisticated ways that allow for virtual contact. From e-mails, chats to instant messaging, these virtual environments have helped to bridge the spatial distance between communicators. The use of e-mails has been adopted in language courses to encourage students to communicate in various styles such as conference-type formats and also to generate discussions.&lt;ref name="Singhal"&gt;{{cite journal

| first = Meena
| last = Singhal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the use of e-mails facilitates language revitalization in the sense that speakers of a minority language who moved to a location where their native language is not being spoken can take advantage of the Internet to communicate with their family and friends, thus maintaining the use of their native language. With the development and increasing use of telephone broadband communication such as [[Skype]], language revitalization through the internet is no longer restricted to literate users.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt;

Hawaiian educators have been taking advantage of the Internet in their language revitalization programs.&lt;ref name="Warschauer"&gt;{{cite journal

The content, interface and menus of the system are entirely in the Hawaiian language. It is installed throughout the immersion school system and includes components for e-mails, chat, dictionary and online newspaper among others. In higher institutions such as colleges and universities where the Leoki system is not yet installed, the educators make use of other software and Internet tools such as Daedalus Interchange, e-mails and the Web to connect students of Hawaiian language with the broader community.&lt;ref name="Warschauer2"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another use of the Internet includes having students of minority languages write about their native cultures in their native languages for distant audiences. Also, in an attempt to preserve their language and culture, [[Occitan]] speakers have been taking advantage of the Internet to reach out to other Occitan speakers from around the world.  These methods provide reasons for using the minority languages by communicating in it.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;{{cite journal

====Exploitation of the Internet====
::''See also: [[Forensic linguistics]]''

The Internet can also be exploited for activities such as [[terrorism]], [[internet fraud]] and [[pedophilia]]. In recent years, there has been an increase in crimes that involved the use of the Internet such as e-mails and [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), as it is relatively easy to remain anonymous.&lt;ref name="BAAS"&gt;{{cite news

From a forensic linguistic point of view, there are many potential areas to explore. While developing a chat room [[Content-control software|child protection procedure]] based on search terms filtering is effective, there is still minimal linguistically orientated literature to facilitate the task.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; In other areas, it is observed that the [[Semantic Web]] has been involved in tasks such as personal [[data protection]], which helps to prevent fraud.&lt;ref name="Ryan Lee"&gt;{{cite book

==Dimensions==

The dimensions covered in this section include looking at the Web as a corpus and issues of language identification and normalization. The impacts of internet linguistics on everyday life are examined under the spread and influence of Internet stylistics, trends of language change on the Internet and conversation discourse.

===The Web as a corpus===

With the Web being a huge reservoir of data and resources, language scientists and technologists are increasingly turning to the web for language data.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"&gt;{{Cite journal

It was met with much controversy as they lacked theoretical integrity leading to much skepticism of their role in the field,&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt; until the publication of the journal ‘Using Large Corpora’ in 1993&lt;ref name="computational linguistics using large corpora"&gt;{{Cite journal

====Themes====

There has been much discussion about the possible developments in the arena of the Web as a corpus. The development of using the web as a data source for word sense disambiguation was brought forward in The EU MEANING project in 2002.&lt;ref name="rigau000"&gt;{{Cite conference

In areas of [[language modeling]], the Web has been used to address data sparseness. Lexical statistics have been gathered for resolving prepositional phrase attachments,&lt;ref name="volk000"&gt;{{Cite conference

In areas of information retrieval, a Web track was integrated as a component in the community’s TREC evaluation initiative. The sample of the Web used for this exercise amount to around 100GB, compromising of largely documents in the .gov top level domain.&lt;ref name="hawking000"&gt;{{Cite conference

====British National Corpus====
{{See also|British National Corpus}}

The [[British National Corpus]] contains ample information on the dominant meanings and usage patterns for the 10,000 words that forms the core of English.

The number of words in the British National Corpus (ca 100 million) is sufficient for many empirical strategies for learning about language for linguists and lexicographers,&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baker001"&gt;{{Cite conference

However, for some other purposes, it is insufficient, as an outcome of the [[Zipfian distribution|Zipfian]] nature of word frequencies. Because the bulk of the lexical stock occurs less than 50 times in the British National Corpus, it is insufficient for statistically stable conclusions about such words. Furthermore, for some rarer words, rare meanings of common words, and combinations of words, no data has been found. Researchers find that probabilistic models of language based on very large quantities of data are better than ones based on estimates from smaller, cleaner data sets.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

{{Update||date=March 2017|inaccurate=yes|talk=The data about percentage of  languages on internet pages is from year 2000 and is no longer accurate.}}

The Web is clearly a multilingual corpus.&lt;ref&gt;Ivković, D. (2013). The Eurovision Song Contest on YouTube: A corpus-based analysis of language attitudes. Language@Internet, 10, article 1. (urn:nbn:de:0009-7-35977)&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 71% of the pages (453 million out of 634 million Web pages indexed by the Excite engine) were written in English, followed by Japanese (6.8%), German (5.1%), French (1.8%), Chinese (1.5%), Spanish (1.1%), Italian (0.9%), and Swedish (0.7%).&lt;ref name="xu000"&gt;{{Cite conference

  | booktitle = Proceedings of the Hawaii International Conference on System Science (HICSS-33)
  | place = Maui, Hawaii
  | year = 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A test to find contiguous words like ‘deep breath’ revealed 868,631 Web pages containing the terms in [[AlltheWeb]]. The number found through the search engines are more than three times the counts generated by the British National Corpus, indicating the significant size of the English corpus available on the Web.

The massive size of text available on the Web can be seen in the analysis of controlled data in which corpora of different languages were mixed in various proportions. The estimated Web size in words by [[AltaVista]] saw English at the top of the list with 76,598,718,000 words. The next is German, with 7,035,850,000 words along with 6 other languages with over a billion hits. Even languages with fewer hits on the Web such as Slovenian, Croatian, Malay, and Turkish have more than one hundred million words on the Web.&lt;ref name="grenstette000"&gt;{{Cite conference

====Challenges====

In areas of language modeling, there are limitations on the applicability of any language model as the statistics for different types of text will be different.&lt;ref name="biber000"&gt;{{Cite journal
 | title = Using register-diversified corpora for general language studies
 | journal = Computational Linguistics
 | volume = 19
 | issue = 2
 | pages = 219–242
 | last = Biber
 | first = Douglas
 | year = 1993
 | publisher = [[MIT Press]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a language technology application is put into use (applied to a new text type), it is not certain that the language model will fare in the same way as how it would when applied to the training corpus. It is found that there are substantial variations in model performance when the training corpus changes.&lt;ref name="sekine000"&gt;{{Cite conference

  | first = Satshi
  | title = The domain dependence of parsing
  | booktitle = Proceedings of the Fifth Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing
  | place = Washington, DC
  | pages = 96–102
  | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of theory types limits the assessment of the usefulness of language-modeling work.

As Web texts are easily produced (in terms of cost and time) and with many different authors working on them, it often results in little concern for accuracy. Grammatical and typographical errors are regarded as “erroneous” forms that cause the Web to be a dirty corpus. Nonetheless, it may still be useful even with some noise.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

The issue of whether [[sublanguage]]s should be included remains unsettled. Proponents of it argue that with all sublanguages removed, it will result in an impoverished view of language. Since language is made up of lexicons, grammar and a wide array of different sublanguages, they should be included. However, it is not until recently that it became a viable option. Striking a middle ground by including some sublanguages is contentious because it’s an arbitrary issue of which to include and which not.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

The decision of what to include in a corpus lies with corpus developers, and it has been done so with pragmatism.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt; The desiderata and criteria used for the British National Corpus serves as a good model for a general-purpose, general-language corpus&lt;ref name="atkins001"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the focus of being representative replaced with being balanced.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

Search engines such as [[Google]] serves as a default means of access to the Web and its wide array of linguistics resources. However, for linguists working in the field of corpora, there presents a number of challenges. This includes the limited instances that are presented by the search engines (1,000 or 5,000 maximum); insufficient context for each instance (Google provides a fragment of around ten words); results selected according to criteria that are distorted (from a linguistic point of view) as search term in titles and headings often occupy the top results slots; inability to allow searches to be specified according to linguistic criteria, such as the citation form for a word, or word class; unreliability of statistics, with results varying according to search engine load and many other factors. At present, in view of the conflicts of priorities among the different stakeholders, the best solution is for linguists to attempt to correct these problems by themselves. This will then lead to a large number of possibilities opening in the area of harnessing the rich potential of the Web.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

====Representation====

Despite the sheer size of the Web, it may still not be representative of all the languages and domains in the world, and neither are other corpora. However, the huge quantities of text, in numerous languages and language types on a huge range of topics makes it a good starting point that opens up to a large number of possibilities in the study of corpora.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

===Impact of its spread and influence===

Stylistics arising from Internet usage has spread beyond the new media into other areas and platforms, including but not limited to, [[films]], [[music]] and [[literary works]]. The infiltration of Internet stylistics is important as mass audiences are exposed to the works, reinforcing certain Internet specific language styles which may not be acceptable in standard or more formal forms of language.

Apart from internet slang, grammatical errors and typographical errors are features of writing on the Internet and other CMC channels. As users of the Internet gets accustomed to these errors, it progressively infiltrates into everyday language use, in both written and spoken forms.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; It is also common to witness such errors in mass media works, from typographical errors in news articles to grammatical errors in advertisements and even internet slang in drama dialogues.

The more the internet is incorporated into daily life, the greater the impact it has on formal language. This is especially true in modern Language Arts classes through the use of smart phones, tablets, and social media. Students are exposed to the language of the internet more than ever, and as such, the grammatical structure and slang of the internet are bleeding into their formal writing. Full immersion into a language is always the best way to learn it. Mark Lester in his book ''&lt;u&gt;Teaching Grammar and Usage&lt;/u&gt;'' states, “The biggest single problem that basic writers have in developing successful strategies for coping with errors is simply their lack of exposure to formal written English...We would think it absurd to expect a student to master a foreign language without extensive exposure to it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Teaching Grammar and Usage|last = Lester|first = Mark|publisher = Allyn and Bacon|year = 2001|isbn = 0205306551|location = Boston|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since students are immersed in internet language, that is the form and structure they are mirroring.

==== Mass media ====

There has been instances of television advertisements using Internet slang, reinforcing the penetration of Internet stylistics in everyday language use. For example, in the [[Cingular Wireless|Cingular]] commercial in the United States, acronyms such as "BFF Jill" (which means "Best Friend Forever, Jill") were used. More businesses have adopted the use of Internet slang in their advertisements as the more people are growing up using the Internet and other CMC platforms, in an attempt to relate and connect to them better.&lt;ref name="Using Internet Slang in Spoken Conversation: LOL!"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such commercials have received relatively enthusiastic feedback from its audiences.&lt;ref name="Using Internet Slang in Spoken Conversation: LOL!"/&gt;

The use of [[Internet lingo]] has also spread into the arena of music, significantly seen in [[popular music]]. A recent example is [[Trey Songz|Trey Songz's]] lyrics for "LOL :-)", which incorporated many Internet lingo and mentions of Twitter and texting.&lt;ref name="Trey Songz LOL"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.treysongz.com/music/lol-ft-gucci-mane-soulja-boy/ | title = LOL :-) Ft. Gucci Mane &amp; Soulja Boy Tell 'Em | work = Song | first = Trey | last = Songz | authorlink = Trey Songz | publisher = Trey Songz| accessdate = 2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of Internet linguistics is also present in [[films]] made by both commercial and [[independent filmmakers]]. Though primarily screened at [[film festivals]], DVDs of independent films are often available for purchase over the internet including paid-live-streamings, making access to films more easily available for the public.&lt;ref name="LOL - The Movie"&gt;{{cite video

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very nature of commercial films being screened at public cinemas allows for the wide exposure to the mainstream mass audience, resulting in a faster and wider spread of Internet slangs. The latest commercial film is titled "LOL" (acronym for ''Laugh Out Loud'' or ''Laughing Out Loud''), starring [[Miley Cyrus]] and [[Demi Moore]].&lt;ref name="Miley Cyrus' Movie 'LOL' Picked Up By Distributor"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of internet slangs is not limited to the English language but extends to other languages as well. The [[Korean language]] has incorporated the English alphabet in the formation of its slang, while others were formed from common misspellings arising from fast typing. The new [[Korean slang]] is further reinforced and brought into everyday language use by television shows such as [[soap operas]] or comedy dramas like “[[High Kick Through the Roof]]” released in 2009.&lt;ref name="Korean Language in Contemporary Society"&gt;[[Korean Language in Contemporary Society]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic future of the Internet==

With the emergence of greater computer/Internet mediated communication systems, coupled with the readiness with which people adapt to meet the new demands of a more technologically sophisticated world, it is expected that users will continue to remain under pressure to alter their language use to suit the new dimensions of communication.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

As the number of Internet users increase rapidly around the world, the cultural background, linguistic habits and language differences among users are brought into the Web at a much faster pace. These individual differences among Internet users are predicted to significantly impact the future of Internet linguistics, notably in the aspect of the multilingual web. As seen from 2000 to 2010, Internet penetration has experienced its greatest growth in non-English speaking countries such as China, India and Africa,&lt;ref name="Internet Usage Statistics"&gt;{{cite web

Also, the interaction between English and other languages is predicted to be an important area of study.&lt;ref&gt;Ivkovic, D., &amp; Lotherington, H. (2009). Multilingualism in cyberspace: Conceptualising the virtual linguistic landscape. International Journal of Multilingualism, 6(1), 17-36.&lt;/ref&gt; As global users interact with each other, possible references to different languages may continue to increase, resulting in formation of new Internet stylistics that spans across languages. Chinese and Korean languages have already experienced English language's infiltration leading to the formation of their multilingual Internet lingo.&lt;ref name="A Comparison of English and Chinese Internet Language"&gt;{{cite web

At current state, the Internet provides a form of education and promotion for minority languages. However, similar to how cross-language interaction has resulted in English language's infiltration into Chinese and Korean languages to form new slangs,&lt;ref name="A Comparison of English and Chinese Internet Language" /&gt; minority languages are also affected by the more common languages used on the Internet (such as English and Spanish). While language interaction can cause a loss in the authentic standard of minority languages, familiarity of the majority language can also affect the minority languages in adverse ways.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Minority Languages, Multimedia and the Web"&gt;{{cite journal

== Early life and education ==
Lubchenco was born on December 4, 1947, and grew up in Denver, Colorado, the oldest of six sisters. Her father, Michael Lubchenco, a surgeon from South Carolina, was of Ukrainian, French, English, Scottish and Irish descent and her mother, LaMeta Dahl Lubchenco, a pediatrician from North Dakota and Minnesota, had Norwegian, French and English ancestry. Lubchenco attended [[St. Mary's Academy (Cherry Hills Village)|St. Mary's Academy]], a Catholic girls high school.&lt;ref name="Allgov.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allgov.com/Official/Lubchenco__Jane |title=Officials: Jane Lubchenco|publisher=AllGov.com |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied as a Ford Independent Studies scholar at [[Colorado College]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], graduating with a B.A. in [[biology]] in 1969. During college, a summer class in [[invertebrate zoology]] at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, sparked her interest in marine biology and research.&lt;ref name="Nature News"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Monastersky|first=Richard|title=Newsmaker of the year: In the eye of the storm|year=2010| doi=10.1038/4681024a |journal=Nature |volume=468|pages=1024–1028|pmid=21179143}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended graduate school at the [[University of Washington]] where she combined experimental and evolutionary approaches to marine ecology for her thesis on competition between sea stars.&lt;ref name="Washington Alumni"&gt;{{cite web|author=Sarah DeWeerdt |url=http://www.washington.edu/alumni/columns-magazine/june-2011/features/lubchenco/ |title=The Natural |publisher=Columns, The University of Washington Alumni Magazine |date=June 2011 |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lubchenco graduated with an M.S. in [[zoology]] in 1971 and then a Ph.D. in 1975 in [[marine ecology]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="thesis-menge-1975"&gt;{{cite thesis |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/302781161/ |title=Effect of herbivores on community structure of the New England rocky intertidal region: distribution, abundance and diversity of algae. |date=1975 |publisher=[[Harvard University]] |type=Ph.D. |last=Menge |first=Jane Lubchenco |via=[[ProQuest]] |subscription=yes |oclc=5575513}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her dissertation dealt with the population and community ecology of rocky sea shores in New England, in particular the role of herbivores, competition among seaweeds, and seaweed defenses against grazers.

== Academic career ==
After obtaining her Ph.D. in 1975, Lubchenco was hired as an assistant professor at [[Harvard University]]. In 1977, she and her husband moved to [[Oregon State University]] (OSU) in Corvallis, Oregon, where she was assistant professor (1977-1982), associate professor (1982-1988) and full professor (1988-2009, 2013–present)&lt;ref name="Allgov.com"/&gt;  Lubchenco served as chair of the Department of Zoology from 1989-1992 and in 1993 was named Distinguished Professor of Zoology. In 1995, she and her husband, Dr. Bruce Menge, were both named Wayne and Gladys Valley Professors of Marine Biology, endowed chair positions in the Department of Zoology.&lt;ref name="Oregon State University"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://campaignforosu.org/howtogive/namingopportunities/endowedpositions/thewayneandgladysvalleychairinmarinebiology/ |title=The Wayne and Gladys Valley Chair in Marine Biology |publisher=Oregon State University |accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; One unique aspect of Lubchenco's position at Oregon State University was the pioneering appointment she and her husband negotiated with the University. To attract them, the University split a single assistant professor position into two, separate, half-time but tenure-track positions. The novel arrangement allowed each of them to spend considerable time with their family while also teaching and doing research.&lt;ref name="Nature News"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lubchenco|first1=J.|last2=Menge|first2=B.|year=1993|title=Split Positions Can Provide a Sane Career Track: A Personal Account|journal=BioScience|volume=43|issue=4|pages=243–248 | doi=10.2307/1312127}}&lt;/ref&gt; This two half-time, tenure-track arrangement for a couple seems to have been the first in the U.S., although thousands of couples have since negotiated similar positions. Each worked half-time for ten years, then three-quarters-time for two years before returning to full-time in 1989, all at OSU.

Lubchenco took a leave of absence from Oregon State University to serve as NOAA Administrator (2009-2013).  After spending three months as Haas Distinguished Visitor in Public Service at Stanford University in the spring of 2013, she returned to OSU. Lubchenco has also been a Research Associate at the Smithsonian Institution (1978-1984) while she conducted research at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. She has also taught courses or conducted extended research at the [[University of the West Indies]], [[Kingston, Jamaica]] (1976); [[Universidad Catolica de Chile]], [[Santiago, Chile]] (1986); Institute of Oceanography, [[Academia Sinica]], [[Qingdao, China]] (1987); and [[University of Canterbury]], [[Christchurch]], New Zealand (1994–95, 1999–2000, 2002–03).&lt;ref name="Allgov.com"/&gt;

== Science communication ==
Throughout her career, Lubchenco has emphasized the responsibilities scientists have to society and the importance of effective communication between scientists and society. In her 1997 address as President of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], she focused on scientists'  "social contract"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lubchenco | first1 = J | year = 1998 | title = Entering the Century of the Environment: A New Social Contract for Science | journal = Science | volume = 279 | issue = 5350| pages = 491–497 | doi = 10.1126/science.279.5350.491 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/24/science/earth/24prof.html?_r=1&amp; |title=NOAA Chief Believes in Science as Social Contract |publisher=The New York Times |date=2009-03-23 |accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; with society, i.e. their obligation to not only create new knowledge that is helpful to society but also to share that knowledge widely, not just with other scientists. She created three organizations devoted to helping scientists become better communicators. In 1998 and 1999, respectively, she founded the Aldo Leopold Leadership Program and COMPASS that train scientists to communicate their research more effectively to citizens, the media, policymakers and business leaders.&lt;ref name = "The New York Times" /&gt; In 2007, Lubchenco co-founded Climate Central, a not-for-profit, non-advocacy organization whose mission is to communicate the science of climate change to U.S. audiences in a manner that is understandable, relevant, credible and useful.

Lubchenco builds bridges between the scientific community and the general public through her public lectures, writing, and service to various scientific, non-governmental and governmental organizations. She has been a member of the Pew Oceans Commission, the Joint Oceans Commission Initiative, the Aspen Institute Arctic Commission, and the Council of Advisors for Google Ocean.&lt;ref name="Allgov.com"/&gt;

==Scientific leadership==
Lubchenco has served the scientific community through leadership in numerous professional societies. She was president of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS; 1997-8), the International Council for Science (ICSU; 2002-5), and the Ecological Society of America (1992–93). She served two terms as a Presidentially nominated, Senate-confirmed Member of the National Science Board (1996-2006) and was elected to the Council of the National Academy of Sciences and appointed to its Executive Committee.  She has been on the editorial boards of many of the major journals in her field.

==Sustainability science==
Lubchenco led the effort of the Ecological Society of America to identify scientific research priorities (biodiversity, climate change and sustainability science); this effort, called the Sustainable Biosphere Initiative (SBI) charted a new course for the professional scientific society toward more use-inspired science.  The SBI connected the dots between seemingly esoteric research topics and real-world environmental problems.&lt;ref name="SBI paper"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lubchenco|first=J.|author2=A.M. Olson|author3=L.B. Brubake |author4=S.R. Carpenter|author5=M.M. Holland|author6=S.P. Hubbell|author7=S.A. Levin|author8=J.A. MacMahon|author9=P.A. Matson|author10=J.M. Melillo|author11=H.A.

Lubchenco co-founded a research/monitoring/communications collaboration that sought to understand how the near-shore portion of the large marine ecosystem off the coasts of Washington, Oregon and California works and is changing, with an eye to improving management and policy.  This collaboration across four universities ([[Oregon State University]], [[University of California at Santa Cruz]], [[Stanford University]], [[University of California at Santa Barbara]]), called the [[Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans]] (PISCO) provided a new model for conducting ecosystem-wide research in which each university would conduct the same basic monitoring and research for its portion of the shoreline, allowing greater comparability and power across the entire system. Findings from the PISCO team have been used by managers and policy makers, e.g., to understand the emergence of new dead zones off Washington and Oregon, and to inform selection criteria for networks of marine reserves and Marine Protected Areas in California and Oregon.

==Marine reserves and marine protected areas==

Lubchenco led an influential study of the science of marine reserves (also called 'no-take' [[marine protected areas]]) – areas of the ocean protected from any extractive or destructive activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lubchenco|first1=J.|authorlink2=Stephen R. Palumbi|first2=S.R.|last2=Palumbi|first3=S.D.|last3=Gaines|first4=S.|last4=Andelman|title=Plugging a Hole in the Ocean: The Emerging Science of Marine Reserves|journal=[[Ecological Applications]]|year=2003|volume=13|issue=1 Supplement|pages=S3-S7|doi=10.1890/1051-0761(2003)013[0003:pahito]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study showed that reserves result in significant increases in abundance, size and diversity of species within the reserve, and that some of this bounty spills over to the area outside the reserve. This study also proposed the concept of 'networks' of reserves – reserves within a large marine ecosystem that are connected by the movement of juveniles or adults.  She famously proposed the '20% by 2020' phrase – that 20% of the world's oceans be protected in marine reserves by the year 2020 to draw attention to the urgent need to protect and restore oceans to health. This proposal and other efforts to promote marine reserves have been controversial and resisted by those who wish to keep extracting resources from oceans.  More recently, where fishermen have exclusive rights to fish along the margins of marine reserves, and thus benefit from the bounty spilling out from the reserve, they have championed establishment of more reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lenny|last=Bernstein|title=Well-funded program tries new approach to tackle overfishing in developing world|date=2014-02-23|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== NOAA ==

=== Appointment ===

Lubchenco served as Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and Administrator of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA)  from 2009 to 2013. She was nominated by President-Elect Barack Obama as a part of his new "Science Team" in December 2008, confirmed by the Senate on March 19, 2009, and sworn in on March 20, 2009. To introduce her to his Senate colleagues for her confirmation hearing, Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) called Lubchenco 'the bionic woman of good science.'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-111shrg51471/html/CHRG-111shrg51471.htm |title=Nominations to the Executive Office of the President and the Department of Commerce| author=Senate Hearing 111-408}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served as Administrator for nearly four years until her resignation on February 27, 2013.

NOAA is the nation's top science agency for climate, weather, and oceans. As head of NOAA, Lubchenco oversaw a staff of 12,800 employees, a budget of ca $5 billion, and ensured NOAA carried out its mission "To understand and predict changes in climate, weather, oceans, and coasts, to share that knowledge and information with others, and to conserve and manage coastal and marine ecosystems and resources.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noaa.gov/about-noaa.html |title=NOAA's Mission |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lubchenco is both the first woman and the first marine ecologist to occupy the post. During her tenure at NOAA, she helped guide the nation through disasters such as the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] and some of the most severe weather on record.&lt;ref name="severe weather"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lubchenco|first=J.|author2=Karl, T.R. |title=Predicting and managing extreme weather events|journal=Physics Today|year=2012|volume=65|issue=3|pages=31–37|doi=10.1063/PT.3.1475}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also oversaw the formulation of NOAA's first scientific integrity policy, the implementation of Congress' instructions to end overfishing in U.S. waters by having management plans for every fishery, the restructuring of the program responsible for building the next generation of weather satellites, and assisted with the creation of the first National Ocean Policy for the United States.

=== Strengthening science ===

NOAA's ability to provide services and stewardship depends on having credible scientific information and good scientists.  Lubchenco helped to strengthen science in the agency in a number of ways. First, the position of Chief Scientist, previously vacant for 16 years, was reinstated, although the Senate did not act to confirm the President's nominee at this time. Second, NOAA doubled the number of senior scientist positions, and created a scientific Council of Fellows. Third, under her leadership, NOAA created its first Scientific Integrity Policy. The Scientific Integrity Policy allows NOAA scientists to speak freely to the media and public, and forbids the manipulation, suppression, distortion and misuse of science in the agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release/NOAA-Sets-High-Bar-With-New-SI-Policy-6213.html |title=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Sets High Bar with New Scientific Integrity Policy, Science Group Says |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists |date=2011-06-16 |accessdate=2014-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301111410/http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release/NOAA-Sets-High-Bar-With-New-SI-Policy-6213.html |archivedate=March 1, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in President Obama's administration, he charged agencies with establishing strong scientific integrity policies that would 'return science to its rightful place' in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about.agu.org/president/presidents-message-archive/obama-administrations-commitment-scientific-integrity/ |title=The Obama Administration's Commitment to Scientific Integrity |publisher=American Geophysical Union |date=2010-12-20 |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; NOAA's Scientific Integrity Policy has been called the "Platinum Standard" for agency policies in protecting the rights of scientists to communicate freely and in ensuring policy makers will not suppress or modify scientific findings. In addition, a first-ever all-agency-scientist workshop was held to identify scientific priorities and ways to strengthen science at the agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/noaa_documents/Science_Workshop_WP_FINAL_2010.pdf |title=Strengthening NOAA Science |publisher=NOAA |date=April 2010 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This workshop helped form the foundation of NOAA's Next Generation Strategic Plan, which assesses the highest priority opportunities for NOAA to contribute to the advancement of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppi.noaa.gov/ngsp/ |title=Next Generation Strategic Plan |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deepwater Horizon oil spill ===

On April 20, 2010, the [[Deepwater Horizon]] oil rig off the coast of Louisiana unexpectedly exploded, causing oil to freely flow into the Gulf of Mexico for the next 87 days. NOAA was one of the lead agencies responsible for responding to the oil spill. Lubchenco led NOAA's response and coordination with 13 other agencies. NOAA provided data from satellites, planes, ships and buoys, and on-the-ground scientists to help track the oil and forecast where it would go; local weather forecasts to inform responders; scientific advice to the U.S. Coast Guard who is in charge of an oil spill in U.S. waters; kept seafood safe by closing fisheries in U.S. waters when oil was present or expected to be present; developed protocols with other agencies to reopen closed areas; protected endangered species such as turtles; and evaluated the impact of the spill on the natural resources of the Gulf and the public's access to them. Lubchenco was frequently interviewed by the media as a federal science expert, and helped disseminate the working knowledge of the response to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2010/04/todays-qs-for-os-wh-4292010/ |title=Today's Questions for Obama's White House, 4/29/2010 |publisher=ABC News |date=2010-04-29 |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; NOAA scientists and their academic partners continue to analyze and monitor the effects of the spill on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] ecosystem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2010/20100804_oil.html |title=Federal Science Report Details Fate of Oil from BP Spill |publisher=NOAA |date=2010-08-04 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lubchenco|first=J.|author2=M.K.

=== Oceans and coasts ===

Lubchenco helped craft the United States' National Ocean Policy, a document that provides a science-based blueprint for managing the U.S.'s oceans, coasts and Great Lakes to help mitigate conflicts between different ocean users (fishermen, shippers, natural resource managers, etc.) and ensure an overarching focus on good stewardship. She actively participated in the President's Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force and attended all of the six regional meetings across the country to gather stakeholder input. Recommendations of this Task Force were adopted by President Obama as the nation's first formal policy on oceans on July 19, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/environment/2010/07/obamas-national-ocean-policy |title=Obama's National Ocean Policy |author=Erik Stokstad |publisher=Science Magazine |date=2010-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/files/documents/2010stewardship-eo.pdf |title=Stewardship of the Ocean, Our Coasts, and the Great Lakes |publisher=The White House Office of the Press Secretary |date=2010-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602205951/http://www.whitehouse.gov/files/documents/2010stewardship-eo.pdf |archivedate=June 2, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While environmental groups, federal and state lawmakers, and federal agency officials applauded the policy, some lawmakers and members of industry felt that it would provide too much regulation. Despite some opposition, on April 16, 2013, the Obama administration laid out an implementation plan for the National Ocean Policy to put into practice the recommendations laid out in the policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/oceans/implementationplan |title=National Ocean Policy Implementation Plan |publisher=The White House |accessdate=2014-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107042245/http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/oceans/implementationplan |archivedate=January 7, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-planet.org/2013/04/17/obama-administration-releases-national-ocean-policy-implementation-plan/ |title=Obama Administration Releases National Ocean Policy Implementation Plan |author=Megan Herzog |publisher=LegalPlanet |date=2013-04-17 |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/04/16/white-house-finalizes-national-ocean-policy/ |title=White House finalizes national ocean policy |author=Juliet Eilperin |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2013-04-16 |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fisheries===

In 2006, Congress re-authorized the [[Magnuson-Stevens Act]] (MSA), the regulatory law for the U.S. fisheries in federal waters. Sustainable fisheries are critical for ensuring sustainable coastal economies and livelihoods. Under the MSA, NOAA was directed to end overfishing by 2010 by having a management plan for each federally managed fishery. Lubchenco led NOAA's efforts to develop MSA management plans, which specify annual catch limits and accountability measures for each fishery.  As of July 2011, in collaboration with the Fishery Management Councils in each region, NOAA completed this task.  Lubchenco's support for limiting fishing in coastal communities led to some Congressmen calling for her resignation.[14, 16] Creating catch limits is often controversial, but thanks to these plans and their enforcement, overfishing is ending in U.S. waters and many depleted fisheries are recovering. According to NOAA, 2012 had the lowest number of stocks on the overfishing list and 32 stocks have been rebuilt since 2000, most within the last few years, creating more sustainable fishing opportunities and healthy ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/statusoffisheries/2012/2012_SOS_RTC.pdf |title=Status of Stocks 2012 |publisher=NOAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an email to NOAA employees, Lubchenco listed "ending over-fishing, rebuilding depleted stocks, and returning fishing to profitability" as a major accomplishment of NOAA during her tenure."&lt;ref name=ClimateCentral&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecentral.org/news/head-of-noaa-lubchenco-to-step-down-in-february-15348 |title=Lubchenco, head of NOAA, to step down in February |author=Andrew Freedman |publisher=ClimateCentral |date=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Lubchenco's leadership, NOAA also pursued use of 'catch shares' as a viable fishery management tool for appropriate fisheries.  Although [[catch share]]s have been used since 1990 in the U.S., scientific evidence about their merits suggests that the wider use of catch shares may benefit many other fisheries, making them once again profitable and sustainable. Science magazine quoted Lubchenco on catch shares, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Recent scientific analyses show us that fisheries managed with catch share programs perform better than fisheries managed with traditional tools. Even in the first years after implementation, catch share fisheries are stable, and even increase their productivity ... I see catch shares as the best way for many fisheries to both meet the Magnuson mandates and have healthy, profitable fisheries that are sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/2009/05/noaa-moves-forward-catch-shares |title=NOAA moves forward with catch shares |publisher=Science Magazine |author=Erik Stokstad |date=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2010, after extensive consultation with regional fishery management councils, NOAA adopted its National Catch Share Policy, which encourages the use of catch shares where appropriate.  Although critics asserted that NOAA imposed catch shares on fisheries, the policy makes it clear that they are not required, nor are they appropriate for every fishery.  NOAA's Catch Share Policy remains controversial, with critics asserting it cuts jobs for fishermen and takes away money from small coastal economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.joincca.org/tag/noaa-catch-share-policy/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140227004428/http://news.joincca.org/tag/noaa-catch-share-policy/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-02-27 |title=Caught up in Catch Shares |publisher=Coastal Conservation Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many coastal economies are beginning to embrace this type of fisheries management and, with the help of NOAA, are implementing a catch share-based system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.opb.org/news/blog/ecotrope/congress-to-noaa-catch-shares-need-your-help/ |title=Congress to NOAA: Catch shares need your help |publisher=Oregon Public Broadcasting |author=Cassandra Profita |date=November 16, 2011|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the four years Lubchenco was at NOAA, the number of catch share programs grew from 5 to 15.  In most of those programs, profitability is up, innovation by fishermen has increased and discards are down.

During Lubchenco's tenure, NOAA's law enforcement program came under fire.  After hearing from fishermen and members of Congress about problems, she requested a review of the program from the Department of Commerce Inspector General. The problems identified by the review were addressed when Lubchenco initiated a top-to-bottom overhaul of the program, including improvements to policy for assessing penalties, limited use of civil funds, updates to its National and Division Enforcement Priorities with stakeholder input, and a plan to create enforcement positions that better ensure compliance. As these changes were being implemented, additional past problems came to light15, triggering additional reforms.

Lubchenco also pushed for greater attention to recreational fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asafishing.org/newsroom/news-releases/noaa-administrator-discusses-recreational-fishings-concerns-at-2009-sportfi/ |title=NOAA Administrator Discusses Recreational Fishing’s Concerns at 2009 Sportfishing Summit |publisher=American Sportfishing Association |date=2009-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504015510/http://asafishing.org/newsroom/news-releases/noaa-administrator-discusses-recreational-fishings-concerns-at-2009-sportfi/ |archivedate=May 4, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oregonlive.com/sports/oregonian/bill_monroe/index.ssf/2009/09/noaa_head_reaches_out_to_angle.html |title=NOAA head Jane Lubchenco reaches out to anglers |author=Bill Monroe |publisher=The Oregonian |date=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She created a new position at NOAA to oversee and represent saltwater fishing interests, called for a Saltwater Recreational Fishing Summit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

Despite significant progress, many recreational fishing organizations continue to express distrust and unhappiness with Lubchenco in particular and NOAA in general.

On the international front, Lubchenco increased the number of efforts aimed at addressing overfishing and illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing on the high seas.  She teamed up with the Commissioner of Fisheries for the [[European Union]], [[Maria Damanaki]] to initiate a more serious effort to address illegal fishing and level the playing field for law-abiding fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/damanaki/headlines/press-releases/2011/08/20110907_en.htm |title=EU and US join efforts against illegal fishing |publisher=European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

=== Climate services ===

Providing data, services and products related to forecasting a changing climate is a main priority for NOAA scientists.  Lubchenco strengthened these efforts. One of her initial goals was to establish the National Climate Service, which would have re-organized NOAA to better provide climate services and products to the public13. However, congressional opposition prevented the budget-neutral re-organization from moving forward. Nonetheless, responding to increasing demands for climate services, under Lubchenco's leadership, NOAA initiated a number of steps.  Climate.gov was created in 2012 as a "one-stop shop" for climate information.  In 2011 NOAA signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Western Governors' Association to provide western states with a range of climate services, for example information about impending drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2011/pdfs/WGA_NOAA_MOU_6.30.11.pdf |title=Memorandum of Understanding Between the Western Governors' Association and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration |date=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westgov.org/initiatives/climate/241-news/news-2011/358-western-governors-noaa-agree-to-work-together-to-improve-climate-services-for-the-west| title=Western Governors, NOAA agree to work together to improve climate services for the West| publisher=Western Governors' Association|date=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said, "Creating a new generation of climate services to promote public understanding, support mitigation and adaptation efforts, enable smart planning, and promote regional climate partnerships"&lt;ref name=ClimateCentral /&gt; were some of the things she was most proud of during her tenure.

During her time, NOAA also led federal agency efforts to develop the most ambitious [[National Climate Assessment]] ever conducted.

===Weather-Ready Nation===

From 2009-2013, the nation experienced some of the most [[extreme weather]] on record. NOAA delivered life-saving forecasts for 770 tornadoes, 70 Atlantic hurricanes/tropical storms, 6 major floods, 3 tsunamis, historic drought, prolonged heat waves, record snowfall/blizzard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climate-one.org/blog/carbon-curves |title=Carbon Curves |date=2013-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305063357/http://www.climate-one.org/blog/carbon-curves |archivedate=March 5, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Lubchenco has said that "bizarre, crazy weather" came to define her term as NOAA Administrator.&lt;ref name="severe weather" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/15/budget-cuts-weather-forecast-noaa_n_2698132.html |title=Budget cuts threaten weather, NOAA's Jane Lubchenco warns |author=Lauren Morello |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=2013-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, NOAA's [[National Weather Service]], the source of all official weather warnings and the main weather forecasting body in the country, decided it could no longer gauge its performance by the accuracy and timeliness of its forecast – it needed to also understand how effective these were at getting people to respond. Under the lead of Dr. Lubchenco, NOAA launched the "Weather-Ready Nation" initiative in the summer of 2011 to help build resilience and improve on-the-ground response to extreme weather and water events.  In March 2011, NOAA initiated the nation's most ambitious upgrading of its [[weather radar]] network, converting all of its 160 radar sites to dual polarization technology, which vastly improves the accuracy and timeliness of forecasts related to weather and water activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/com/weatherreadynation/news/130425_dualpol.html |title=Dual-polarization radar: Stepping stones to building a Weather-Ready Nation |publisher=NOAA |date=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hurricane Sandy===

In late October 2012, [[Hurricane Sandy]] hit the east coast of the United States, devastating communities across the eastern seaboard and west to Michigan and Wisconsin. NOAA technology and scientists helped to accurately predict the path of the storm, allowing on-the-ground warnings to be issued in time to save lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2012/12/10/jane-lubchenco-wicked-problems/ |title=NOAA's Jane Lubchenco on 'society's wicked problems' |publisher=UC Berkeley News Center |author=Barry Bergman |date=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tohōku earthquake===

On March 11, 2011, the large Tohoku earthquake occurred off the coast of Japan, which was the precursor to the devastating [[Fukushima, Fukushima#21st century|Fukushima earthquake]] one month later. NOAA was involved in predicting where radioactive material and [[marine debris]] would go, how the currents would carry the material, and helping coastal states and communities prepare for dealing with the debris when it arrived.

==Research and publications==

According to the [[Institute for Scientific Information]], eight of Lubchenco's numerous scientific papers have been cited so many times in other scientific publications they are considered 'science citation classic papers' or 'top 0.25% papers'.  These papers report novel findings about the factors determining local and global patterns of distribution, abundance and diversity of species on rocky sea shores, interactions between people and nature, the importance of no-take marine protected areas and the responsibilities of scientists to society.  The eight classic papers are:

Most of Lubchenco's earlier research concentrated on local ecological patterns of rocky sea shores and their causes; her later research looks at ocean ecosystems more broadly – how they work, how they are changing and implications for policy and management.  She has shifted her focus to conducting research that informs sustainable use of oceans and has worked on a range of interrelated topics including aquaculture, fisheries, climate change, biodiversity, ecosystem services, dead zones (hypoxia and anoxia), ecosystem approaches to management and marine reserves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1723">In artificial intelligence, knowledge-based agents draw on a pool of logical sentences to infer conclusions about the [[world]].  At the '''knowledge level''', we only need to specify what the agent knows and what its goals are; a logical abstraction separate from details of implementation.

This notion of knowledge level was first introduced by [[Allen Newell]] in the 1980s, to have a way to rationalize an agent's behavior.  The agent takes actions based on knowledge it possesses, in an attempt to reach specific goals.  It chooses actions according to the [[principle of rationality]].

Beneath the knowledge level resides the [[symbol level]].  Whereas the knowledge level is ''world'' oriented, namely that it concerns the environment in which the agent operates, the symbol level is ''system'' oriented, in that it includes the mechanisms the agent has available to operate.  The knowledge level ''rationalizes'' the agent's behavior, while the symbol level ''mechanizes'' the agent's behavior.

For example, in a computer program, the knowledge level consists of the information contained in its data structures that it uses to perform certain actions.  The symbol level consists of the program's algorithms, the data structures themselves, and so on.

'''Meltwater management''' is a runoff management system designed to deal with runoff caused by the melting of snow in colder climates. They were designed when it became apparent that using the [[Best management practice for water pollution|Best management practice]] (BMP) for rainfall runoff was not working.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stormwater.pca.state.mn.us/index.php/Cold_climate_impact_on_runoff_management|title=Cold climate impact on runoff management - Minnesota Stormwater Manual|website=stormwater.pca.state.mn.us|language=en|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Snow filtration''' is a system to deal with left-over [[snow]] in an [[environmentally friendly]] way. Removing snow from roads is done to ensure [[road safety]]. The conventional method is by removing the snow and emptying it into rivers. However, since salt is used to melt ice on the roads, the salt also enters the rivers with the dumped snow. This increases the salt content of the rivers which can have impacts on aquatic and marine ecosystems. The practice of removing snow from streets and off-loading it into rivers affects the aquatic ecosystems. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindsay|first1=Jay|title=Dump Snow in Rivers, Harbors? There's a Downside.|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/41427190/ns/us_news-environment/t/dump-snow-rivers-harbors-theres-downside/#.WQzRIcm1uRs|website=NBCNews|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
In spring as snow melts, the salt used on roads as a deicer is left behind, which can be environmentally damaging as it creates a [[Tonicity#Hypertonicity|hypertonic]] environment for plants.

The snow [[Surface runoff|runoff]] is collected and brought to a collection center. It is directed through an oil and grit separator which also monitors the consistency of pollutants in the runoff. The oil and grit separator causes [[electrochemical]] and [[biological process|biological]] processes, which bind [[heavy metals]] and [[nutrients]] to the sediment by means of [[redox|
reduction-oxidation]] reactions. At the same time, this reduces the amount of [[chlorine]] present in the runoff. 

The runoff then flows into a [[catch basin]], where plants use the salt [[ions]] (e.g. [[Potassium|K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Phosphorus|P&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Nitrogen|N&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;]]) for their growth.The runoff is further filtered by the plants, leaving only clean water to go back into [[streams]] and [[river]]s.&lt;!-- Plagiarism --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18752">A '''[[Metropolitan area|metropolitan]] [[planning]] organization''' ('''MPO''') is a federally mandated and federally funded [[transportation]] policy-making organization in the [[United States]] that is made up of representatives from local [[government]] and governmental transportation authorities. They were created to ensure regional cooperation in transportation planning. MPOs were introduced by the [[Federal-Aid Highway Act|Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1962]], which required the formation of an MPO for any [[urban area|urbanized area]] (UZA) with a population greater than 50,000. Federal funding for transportation projects and programs are channeled through this planning process. Congress created MPOs in order to ensure that existing and future expenditures of governmental funds for transportation projects and programs are based on a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive (“3&amp;#8209;C”) planning process. Statewide and metropolitan transportation planning processes are governed by federal law ({{UnitedStatesCode|23|134|135}}). Transparency through public access to participation in the planning process and [[Internet|electronic publication]] of plans now is required by federal law. As of 2015, there are 408 MPOs in the United States.&lt;ref name="hepgislist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hepgis.fhwa.dot.gov/hepgismaps11/ViewMap.aspx?map=MPO+Boundaries%7CMPO+Boundary |title=MPO Boundary Data  |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |accessdate=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Number of MPOs by state.png|thumb|Chart showing the number of Metropolitan Planning Organizations by state as of September 2015.]]

==Purpose==
Purposes of MPOs:{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
* Transportation investment allocates scarce federal and other transportation funding resources;
* Planning needs to reflect the region’s shared vision for its future;
* Adequate transportation planning requires a comprehensive examination of the region’s future and investment alternatives; and
* An MPO acts as a Council of Governments; that is, it facilitates collaboration of governments, interested parties, and residents in the planning process.

In other words, the federal government requires that federal transportation funds be allocated to regions in a manner that has a basis in metropolitan  plans developed through intergovernmental collaboration, rational analysis, and consensus-based decision making.{{citation need|date=October 2017}}

==Governance==
Typically, an MPO [[governance]] structure includes a variety of committees as well as a professional staff. The “policy committee” is the top-level decision-making body for the planning organization. In most MPOs, the policy committee comprises:{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
*elected or appointed officials from local governmental jurisdictions such as [[municipalities]] or [[county|counties]];
*representatives of different transportation [[Transport mode|modes]], such as [[public transit]], [[freight]], [[bicycle]]/[[pedestrian]]; and
*state agency officials such as, state [[Department of Transportation]], environmental agency, etc.; and
*non-voting members such as [[Federal Highway Administration|FHWA]], [[Federal Transit Administration|FTA]], [[FAA]], [[Federal Railroad Administration|FRA]], staff advisers from state departments of transportation, [[Chambers of Commerce]]

With only a few unique exceptions nationwide (such as the [[Metro (Oregon regional government)|MPO in Portland, Oregon]]), MPO policy committee members are not elected directly by citizens. Rather, a policy committee member typically is an elected or appointed official of one of the MPO’s constituent local jurisdictions. The policy committee member thus has legal authority to speak and act on behalf of that jurisdiction in the MPO setting. Federal law, however, does not require members of an MPO policy committee to be representatives of the metropolitan areas' populations. Systematic studies have found that MPO policy committees' representations of urban municipalities and disadvantaged minority populations in their areas are less than proportional to population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author=Thomas W. Sanchez |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=January 2006 |title=An Inherent Bias? Geographic and Racial-Ethnic Patterns of Metropolitan Planning Organization Boards |url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2006/06/01transportation-sanchez |publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] Metropolitan Policy Program |series=Series on Transportation Reform |page= |docket= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy committee’s responsibilities include debating and making decisions on key MPO actions and issues, including adoption of the metropolitan long-range transportation plans, [[transportation improvement program]]s, annual planning work programs, budgets, and other policy documents. The policy committee also may play an active role in key decision points or milestones associated with MPO plans and studies, as well as conducting public hearings and meetings. An appointed advisory committee (CAC) develops the recommendations for consideration by the policy committee and establishes a ranked proposal for work plans.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Most MPOs also establish a technical committee to act as an advisory body to the policy committee for transportation issues that primarily are technical in nature. The technical committee interacts with the MPO’s professional staff on technical matters related to planning, analysis tasks, and projects. Through this work, the technical committee develops recommendations on projects and programs for policy committee consideration. Metropolitan travel forecasting is one of the key roles that the technical committee supports. The technical committee typically comprises staff-level officials of local, state, and federal agencies. In addition, a technical committee may include representatives of interest groups, various transportation modes, and local citizens. A 2005 survey of MPOs nationally commissioned in preparation of "Special Report&amp;nbsp;288" of the [[Transportation Research Board]] of the [[National Academies]] found that "forecast by negotiation" was a common method of projecting future population and employment growth for use in [[Transportation forecasting|travel forecasting]], suggesting [[rent-seeking]] behavior on the part of MPO committees influencing the technical staff.&lt;ref&gt;Committee for Determination of the State of the Practice in Metropolitan Area Travel Forecasting, Transportation Research Board of the National Academies. (2007) Metropolitan Travel Forecasting: Current Practice and Future Direction. Transportation Research Board Special Report 288. [http://www.trb.org/Main/Blurbs/Metropolitan_Travel_Forecasting_Current_Practice_a_158933.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually MPOs retain a core professional staff in order to ensure the ability to carry out the required metropolitan planning process in an effective and expeditious manner. The size and qualifications of this staff may vary by MPO, since no two metropolitan areas have identical planning needs Most MPOs, however, require at least some staff dedicated solely to MPO process oversight and management because of the complexity of the process and need to ensure that requirements are properly addressed.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Functions==
===Core functions===

There are five core functions of an MPO:
#'''establish a setting''':  establish and manage a fair and impartial setting for effective regional decision-making in the metropolitan area (UZA)
# '''evaluate alternatives''':  evaluate transportation alternatives, scaled to the size and complexity of the region, to the nature of its transportation issues, and to the realistically available options
#'''maintain a [[regional transportation plan]] (RTP)''':  develop and update a fiscally constrained long-range transportation plan for the UZA covering a planning horizon of at least twenty years that fosters
#* mobility and access for people and goods,
#* efficient system performance and preservation, and
#* quality of life
# '''develop a [[transportation improvement program]] (TIP)''': develop a fiscally constrained program based on the long-range transportation plan and designed to serve the UZA’s goals while using spending, regulating, operating, management, and financial tools
#'''involve the public''': involve the general public and all the significantly affected sub-groups in the four essential functions listed above.

If the metropolitan area is designated as an [[air quality]] [[non-attainment area|non-attainment]] or maintenance area, then

#&lt;li value="6"&gt;'''protect air quality''': transportation plans, programs, and projects must conform with the air quality plan, known as the “[[State Implementation Plan|state implementation plan]]” (SIP), for the state within which the UZA lies.

Presently, most MPOs have no authority to raise revenues such as to levy taxes on their own, rather, they are designed to allow local officials to decide collaboratively how to spend available federal and other governmental transportation funds in their urbanized areas. The funding for the operations of an MPO comes from a combination of federal transportation funds and required matching funds from state and local governments.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Expanded functions===
In some regions, MPOs have been given authority to handle expanded functions:

* Managing a regional [[urban growth boundary]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonmetro.gov/urban-growth-boundary|title=Urban growth boundary|author=|date=19 May 2014|website=oregonmetro.gov|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Distributing a Regional Housing Need Allocation to [[Smart growth|manage growth]] and ensure [[affordable housing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abag.ca.gov/planning/housingneeds/|title=ABAG Planning: Regional Housing Need Allocation (RHNA)|author=|date=|website=www.abag.ca.gov|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Operating the region's [[public transportation]] services&lt;ref&gt;Governing Metropolitan Areas: Growth and Change in a Networked Age. David K. Hamilton, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure of MPO organizations==
MPOs differ greatly in various parts of the country and even within states. Some have large staffs, while others may include only a director and a transportation planner. Sometimes the professional staff of an MPO is provided by a county or a council of governments. In many urban areas, existing organizations such as county governments or councils of government also function as MPOs. The MPO role also may be played by an independent governmental organization or a regional government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bond|first=Alexander|title=Staffing and Administrative Capacity of Metropolitan Planning Organizations|url=http://www.cutr.usf.edu/programs/pcm/files/2010-05-Staffing_and_Administrative_Capacity_of_MPOs.pdf|work=Staffing and Administrative Structure of Metropolitan Planning Organizations|publisher=CUTR/FHWA|accessdate=2011-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area, for example, [[Metro (Oregon regional government)|Metro]] is the MPO. In the [[Minneapolis-St.&amp;nbsp;Paul, Minnesota]], metropolitan area, the [[Metropolitan Council]] is the MPO.

An example of a medium-sized MPO is the [[Lexington Area MPO]] in [[Kentucky]]. An example of a small MPO is the [[Kittery, Maine|Kittery Area MPO]] in [[Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smrpc.org/transportation|title=/kacts/kacts.htm smrpc.org|author=|date=|website=smrpc.org|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another MPO planning organization has developed in the area of western central [[Florida]]. Several MPOs there, with governance over eight counties, have developed a greater regional planning committee, the Chairs Coordinating Committee (CCC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionaltransportation.org/|title=Chairs Coordinating Committee|first=|last=Developer|date=|website=www.regionaltransportation.org|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; composed of the chairs of seven MPOs and the chairs of their appointed advisory committee (or their representatives) in order to coordinate transportation planning for the region, that is compatible with all, as well as addressing the challenges of long range planning for a large and growing region that has overlapping issues among the MPOs or transportation plans that extend throughout the entire area. Often the members of the executive committee of an MPO act interchangeably as the representative to this seven-MPO regional committee. This committee meets less frequently than the participating MPOs.

==Evolving role==
The enactment of the 1991 [[Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act]] (ISTEA) ushered in a “renaissance” for MPOs. After a decade or more of being consigned to a minimal role in transportation planning, ISTEA directed additional federal funding to MPOs, expanded their authority to select projects, and mandated new metropolitan planning initiatives. For the first time, state transportation officials were required to consult seriously with local representatives on MPO governing boards regarding matters of project prioritization and decision-making. These changes had their roots in the need to address increasingly difficult transportation problems&amp;mdash;in particular, the more complicated patterns of [[traffic congestion]] that arose with the [[suburban]] development boom in the previous decades. Many recognized that the problems could only be addressed effectively through a stronger federal commitment to regional planning.

The legislation that emerged, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), was signed into federal law by President [[George H.&amp;nbsp;W. Bush]] in December 1991. It focused on improving transportation, not as an end in itself, but as the means to achieve important national goals including economic progress, [[Air pollution|cleaner air]], [[energy conservation]], and [[social equity]]. ISTEA promoted a transportation system in which different modes and facilities&amp;mdash;highway, transit, [[pedestrian]], [[bicycle]], [[aviation]], and [[Marine (ocean)|marine]]&amp;mdash;were integrated to allow a "seamless" movement of both goods and people. New funding programs provided greater flexibility in the use of funds, particularly regarding using previously restricted highway funds for transit development,  improved "[[intermodal passenger transport|intermodal]]" connections, and emphasized upgrades to existing facilities over building new capacity&amp;mdash;particularly roadway capacity.

To accomplish more serious metropolitan planning, ISTEA doubled federal funding for MPO operations and required the agencies to evaluate a variety of [[multimodal transport|multimodal]] solutions to roadway congestion and other transportation problems. MPOs also were required to broaden public participation in the planning process and to see that investment decisions contributed to meeting the air quality standards of the [[Clean Air Act Amendments]].

In addition, ISTEA placed a new requirement on MPOs to conduct “fiscally constrained planning”, and ensure that long-range transportation plans and short-term [[transportation improvement program]]s were fiscally constrained; in other words, adopted plans and programs can not include more projects than reasonably can be expected to be funded through existing or projected sources of revenues. This new requirement represented a major conceptual shift for many MPOs (and others in the planning community), since the imposition of fiscal discipline on plans now required, not only understanding how much money might be available, but how to prioritize investment needs and make difficult choices among competing needs. Adding to this complexity is the need to plan across transportation modes and develop approaches for multimodal investment prioritization and decision making. It is in this context of greater prominence, funding, and requirements that MPOs function today.

An annual element is composed of transportation improvement projects contained in an area's transportation improvement program (TIP), which is proposed for implementation during the current year. The annual element is submitted to the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Department of Transportation]] as part of the required planning process.

The passage of Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users [[SAFETEA&amp;#8209;LU]] in 2005 created new and revised requirements for transportation planning and programs. Although SAFETEA-LU increased standards, most MPOs already were in compliance with the regulations. Some of the planning topic areas include transportation systems security, emergency preparedness, public participation plans for metropolitan planning, and requiring the [[Internet|electronic publication]] of plans and TIP/STIP by the MPOs.

SAFETEA-LU requires that the statewide transportation planning process and the metropolitan planning process provide for consideration of projects and strategies that will protect and enhance the environment, promote energy conservation, improve the quality of life, and promote consistency between transportation improvements and state and local planned growth and economic development patterns.&lt;ref&gt;49 USC 5303(g)(3) and 23 USC 134(g)(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Microphone Splitter.jpg|thumb|A microphone splitter]]

A '''microphone splitter''' is a device with an input from a [[microphone]] and multiple outputs. It is also known as a "'''rathouse'''" due to the large amount of cabling involved. A splitter is often used at larger venues to provide feeds from microphones or other sources to both a [[front of house]] [[mixing desk]] and a monitor desk.  This allows the monitor mix to be different from the house mix, so that the musicians may hear a mix with certain instruments emphasized, which can assist in achieving a feeling of "tightness".

In a simple splitter the outputs are connected in [[Parallel circuits | parallel]], with no isolation between outputs.  In cases where each output is connected to a system with a different [[Ground (electricity) | ground potential]], this can cause [[ground loop (electricity)|ground loops]], a common source of noise in an audio system.  To provide isolation and prevent ground loops, outputs may be connected via a splitting [[transformer]] or a number of [[buffer amplifiers]].  

Each additional output puts additional [[Electrical load | load]] on the source, which can cause signal degradation.  Active splitters with buffer amplifiers (also known as a [[distribution amplifier]]) are the only solution to provide an unlimited number of splits, but are costly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8927">The '''NK model''' is a [[mathematical model]] described by its primary inventor [[Stuart Kauffman]] as a "tunably rugged" [[fitness landscape]]. "Tunable ruggedness" captures the intuition that both the overall size of the landscape and the number of its local "hills and valleys" can be adjusted via changes to its two parameters, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, defined below.  The NK model has found application in a wide variety of fields, including the theoretical study of [[evolutionary biology]], [[immunology]], [[combinatorial optimization|optimisation]], [[technological evolution]], and [[complex systems]]. The model was also adopted in [[organizational theory]], where it is used to describe the way an [[Agent-based model|agent]] may search a landscape by manipulating various characteristics of itself. For example, an agent can be an [[organization]], the hills and valleys represent [[Profit (economics)|profit]] (or changes thereof), and movement on the landscape necessitates organizational decisions (such as adding product lines or altering the organizational structure), which tend to interact with each other and affect profit in a complex fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levinthal | first1 = D. A. | year = 1997 | title = Adaptation on Rugged Landscapes | url = | journal = Management Science | volume = 43 | issue = 7| pages = 934–950 | doi=10.1287/mnsc.43.7.934}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An early version of the model, which considered only the smoothest (&lt;math&gt;K=0&lt;/math&gt;) and most rugged (&lt;math&gt;K=N-1&lt;/math&gt;) landscapes, was presented in Kauffman and Levin (1987).&lt;ref name = "kauff"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kauffman | first1 = S. | last2 = Levin | first2 = S. | year = 1987 | title = Towards a general theory of adaptive walks on rugged landscapes | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 128 | issue = 1| pages = 11–45 | doi=10.1016/s0022-5193(87)80029-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The model as it is currently known first appeared in Kauffman and Weinberger (1989).&lt;ref name = "KandW"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kauffman | first1 = S. | last2 = Weinberger | first2 = E. | year = 1989 | title = The NK Model of rugged fitness landscapes and its application to the maturation of the immune response | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 141 | issue = 2| pages = 211–245 | doi=10.1016/s0022-5193(89)80019-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the reasons why the model has attracted wide attention in [[combinatorial optimization|optimisation]] is that it is a particularly simple instance of a so-called [[NP-complete problem]].&lt;ref name = "NPcomplete"&gt;Weinberger, E. (1996), "NP-completeness of Kauffman's N-k model, a Tuneably Rugged Fitness Landscape", Santa Fe Institute Working Paper, 96-02-003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical details ==
The NK model defines a [[combinatorial]] [[phase space]], consisting of every string (chosen from a given alphabet) of length &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. For each string in this search space, a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] value (called the ''[[fitness function|fitness]]'') is defined. If a distance [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] is defined between strings, the resulting structure is a ''landscape''.

Fitness values are defined according to the specific incarnation of the model, but the key feature of the NK model is that the fitness of a given string &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of contributions from each locus &lt;math&gt;f_i(S)&lt;/math&gt; in the string:

:&lt;math&gt;F(S) = \sum_i \tilde{f}_i(S),&lt;/math&gt;

and the contribution from each locus in general depends on its state and the state of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; other loci,:

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}_i(S) = f_i(S_i, S_{k_{i1}}, \dots, S_{k_{iK}}), &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the index of the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th neighbor of locus &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. 

Hence, the fitness function &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]] between strings of length ''K''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 and scalars, which Weinberger's later work calls "fitness contributions". Such fitness contributions are often chosen randomly from some specified probability distribution.

In 1991, Weinberger published a detailed analysis&lt;ref name="AnalyticOptima" /&gt;  of the case in which &lt;math&gt;1 &lt;&lt; k \le N&lt;/math&gt; and the fitness contributions are chosen randomly.  His analytical estimate of the number of local optima was later shown to be flawed {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}.  However, numerical experiments included in Weinberger's analysis support his analytical result that the expected fitness of a string is normally distributed with a mean of approximately

&lt;math&gt; \mu + \sigma \sqrt{{2 \ln (k+1)} \over {k+1}}&lt;/math&gt;

and a variance of approximately

&lt;math&gt; {{(k+1)\sigma^2} \over {N[k+1 + 2(k+2)\ln(k+1)]}}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Visualization of two dimensions of a NK fitness landscape.png|thumb|Visualization of two dimensions of a NK fitness landscape. The arrows represent various mutational paths that the population could follow while evolving on the fitness landscape.]]

== Example ==
For simplicity, we will work with [[Binary code|binary]] strings. Consider an NK model with ''N'' = 5, ''K'' = 1. Here, the fitness of a string is given by the sum of individual fitness contributions from each of 5 loci. Each fitness contribution depends on the local locus value and one other. We will employ the convention that &lt;math&gt;f(S_i) = f(S_i, S_{i+1})&lt;/math&gt;, so that each locus is affected by its neighbour, and &lt;math&gt;f(S_5) = f(S_5, S_1)&lt;/math&gt; for cyclicity. If we choose, for example, the fitness function ''f''(0, 0) = 0; ''f''(0, 1) = 1; ''f''(1, 0) = 2; ''f''(1, 1) = 0, the fitness values of two example strings are:

:&lt;math&gt; F(00101) = f(0,0)  + f(0,1) + f(1,0) + f(0, 1) + f(1, 0) = 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6. &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; F(11100) = f(1,1)  + f(1,1) + f(1,0) + f(0, 0) + f(0, 1) = 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 3. &lt;/math&gt;

== Tunable topology ==
[[Image:Nk model hypercube.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Illustration of tunable topology in the NK model. Nodes are individual binary strings, edges connect strings with a [[Hamming distance]] of exactly one. (left) ''N'' = 5, ''K'' = 0. (centre) ''N'' = 5, ''K'' = 1. (right) ''N'' = 5, ''K'' = 2. The colour of a node denotes its fitness, with redder values having higher fitness. The [[embedding]] of the hypercube is chosen so that the fitness maximum is at the centre. Notice that the ''K'' = 0 landscape appears smoother than the higher-K cases.]]

The value of ''K'' controls the degree of [[epistasis]] in the NK model, or how much other loci affect the fitness contribution of a given locus. With ''K'' = 0, the fitness of a given string is a simple sum of individual contributions of loci: for nontrivial fitness functions, a [[global optimum]] is present and easy to locate (the genome of all 0s if ''f''(0) &gt; ''f''(1), or all 1s if ''f''(1) &gt; ''f''(0)). For nonzero ''K'', the fitness of a string is a sum of fitnesses of substrings, which may interact to [[Geometrical frustration|frustrate]] the system (consider how to achieve optimal fitness in the example above). Increasing ''K'' thus increases the ruggedness of the fitness landscape.

=== Variations with neutral spaces ===
The bare NK model does not support the phenomenon of ''neutral space'' -- that is, sets of genomes connected by single mutations that have the same fitness value. Two adaptations have been proposed to include this [[Neutral theory of molecular evolution|biologically important structure]]. The ''NKP model'' introduces a parameter &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;: a proportion &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; of the &lt;math&gt;2^K&lt;/math&gt; fitness contributions is set to zero, so that the contributions of several genetic motifs are degenerate {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}. The ''NKQ model'' introduces a parameter &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and enforces a discretisation on the possible fitness contribution values so that each contribution takes one of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; possible values, again introducing degeneracy in the contributions from some genetic motifs {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}. The bare NK model corresponds to the &lt;math&gt;P = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q = \infty&lt;/math&gt; cases under these parameterisations.

== Applications ==
The NK model has found use in many fields, including in the study of [[spin glasses]], [[epistasis]] and [[pleiotropy]] in [[evolutionary biology]], and [[combinatorial optimisation]].

'''NextGenPower''' is an integrated project which aims to demonstrate new alloys and coatings in boiler, turbine and interconnecting pipework.  The concept of NextGenPower is to perform innovative demonstrations that will significantly contribute to the [[European Union|EU]] target to increase the efficiency in existing and new build pulverized coal power plants.

==Background==
[[Carbon Capture and Storage]] (CCS) is envisaged to be the main transition technology to comply with the CO2 reduction targets set by the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nextgenpower.eu/images/Documents/nextgenpower_brochure.pdf  NextGenPower Brochure]&lt;/ref&gt; However, CCS has the drawback that the electrical efficiency of the coal-fired power plant will drop significantly. The efficiency loss caused by CCS in coal-fired power plants will range from 4 to 12% points, depending on the CCS technology chosen.
To overcome this drawback, one has to increase the plant efficiency or the share of [[biomass]] co-firing. Both options are limited due to the quality of the current available coatings and materials. Live steam temperatures well in excess of 700°C are necessary to compensate the efficiency loss caused by CCS and to achieve a net efficiency of 45%.
NextGenPower aims to develop and demonstrate coatings and materials that can be applied in ultra-supercritical (in excess of 700˚C) conditions.

==Summary==
The NextGenPower project was due to start on 1 May 2010 and have a duration of 48 months.  The budget is €10.3million, with an EU contribution making up €6million of the budget.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nextgenpower.eu/  NextGenPower]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
The following scientific and technological objectives have been defined for NextGenPower, leading to the following project activities:
*Demonstrating the application of precipitation hardened [[Nickel]]-alloys for [[pulverized coal-fired boiler]]s having allowable levels of creep and fatigue evolving from high temperatures envisaged with USC
*Demonstrating the application of cost-effective fireside coatings, compatible with affordable and available tube alloys, for coal-fired boilers capable of withstanding the corrosive conditions envisaged with USC and the environment of biomass co-firing under different conditions
*Demonstrating the application of cost-effective steam side coatings/protective layers to extend the life of boiler tube and interconnecting pipe work, and to facilitate the use of cheaper alternative materials without compromising component life or reliability
*Demonstrating the application of Ni-alloys for interconnecting pipe work between boiler and [[steam turbine]] withstanding high temperatures envisaged with USC and to explore alternative design options to allow for the use of cheaper, more available materials than Ni-alloys
*Demonstrating the capability to [[castings|cast]], [[forging|forge]] and [[welding|weld]] Ni-alloys for critical steam turbine components

==Sub-projects==
There are also four sub-projects which will be focused on throughout the course of the NextGenPower project.

===Sub Project 1 – boiler===
NextGenPower aims at overcoming fireside corrosion and steamside [[oxidation]] in high temperature parts through the application of suitable coatings. The main goal for Sub Project 1 is to demonstrate the benefits and limitations of materials and coatings for the fireside under biomass co-firing conditions as well as for the boiler and main steam pipework under USC and current steam conditions.

===Sub Project 2 - steam turbine===
The main goals for Sub Project 2 are to select the best candidate alloys for the HP and ID steam turbines operating at high steam temperatures (≥720˚C).   A number of nickel-base alloys have been developed whose properties have  been proven at the laboratory scale and for small-scale components. The main uncertainty in the application of these alloys for steam turbine applications is the ability to manufacture, weld and inspect large components. The performance in service presents a much smaller risk since there is confidence that the mechanical behaviour can be modelled on the basis of the material properties. This philosophy follows the approach applied in the development, demonstration and exploitation of materials technology for 700-720˚C steam turbines in other projects ([[AD700]], [[AD700#Phase 3 - COMTES 700|COMTES]], EON 50plus) where the first commercial steam turbine will enter service without prior operation in a test loop. Following alloy selection, full-scale steam turbine casings and rotor forgings will be manufactured and materials properties demonstrated through implementation of a mechanical testing programme. Full-scale demonstration of the welding technology and the NDE capability required for welded rotor and casing manufacture will also be carried out.

===Sub Project 3 – integration===
Sub Project 3 provides a framework for the testing and demonstration work in the overall project.  It will review the expected operating parameters required for NGP plants, with and without CO2 capture technologies, and with and without biomass co-firing. The aim is to evaluate a series of NextGenPower plants with CCS systems in terms of their power generation efficiencies and CO2 emissions per unit of electricity generated.

===Sub Project 4 – dissemination===
The main goal for Sub Project 4 is to ensure that the generic results and results from topical activities are actively disseminated. It promotes results and approaches and encourages the duplication in other, thereby contributing to EU objectives of the CO2 reduction, efficiency improvement and security of energy supply. Another objective is to facilitate the sharing of policies, approaches and knowledge between the participants.

The '''Oxford Centre for Maritime Archaeology''' ('''OCMA''') is a specialist research group within the School of [[Archaeology]] at the [[University of Oxford]] in [[England]].

==Overview==
Established in 2003 with the ongoing support of the [[Hilti Foundation]], the OCMA is devoted to the study of people who live or work on and around water. The centre offers undergraduate and postgraduate courses in maritime archaeology and fosters research that ranges from the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and its surrounding seas and oceans to the maritime cultures and peoples of the Indian Ocean and [[South China Sea]] from antiquity to the early modern period. In [[Egypt]], the OCMA collaborates on field projects implemented by the [[Institut Européen d’Archéologie Sous-Marine]] (IEASM),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieasm.org Institut Européen d'Archéologie Sous-Marine] (IEASM).&lt;/ref&gt; under the direction of [[Franck Goddio]]. In 2011, OCMA began the excavation of shipwreck 43 in [[Aboukir Bay]] and the centre is also involved in work in [[Libya]]. Its research is disseminated through a vigorous programme of international conferences and in-house monograph publication.

==Teaching and research==
The Oxford Centre for Maritime Archaeology offers post-graduate courses in maritime archaeology and provides post-graduate supervision within the School of Archaeology and the Faculty of Classics.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The Hilti Foundation funds two postgraduate studentships into research relating to IEASM excavations in ancient [[Heracleion]]. Current{{when|date=December 2013}} post-graduates research includes the Byzantine harbours in [[Greece]] and [[Spain]], and the maritime archaeology of the [[Philippines]], [[Korea]] and [[Cambodia]]. An option in Mediterranean maritime archaeology is also available to undergraduates.

==Excavation==
The Oxford Centre for Maritime Archaeology is actively engaged in fieldwork as part of its on-going research strategy. It also offers training opportunities in field methods for its students.

===Shipwreck 43, Aboukir Bay===
OCMA is currently{{when|date=December 2013}} excavating shipwreck 43, one of 67 ancient ships so-far recorded by IEASM under Franck Goddio.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, D. (2012). "News"''Nautical archaeology Society Newsletter'' (Winter 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Tentatively dated to between 785-481 cal BC, the vessel has a distinctive form of naval architecture that has not been fully documented elsewhere in the ancient [[Mediterranean]]. This involved the use of long tenons that were initially fitted into mortice holes that passed through the keel plank over which multiple lines of planking were added, pegged into place with wooden treenails. From the albeit limited excavations, there do not appear to be any frames and consequently the long tenons may have provided the structural stability of the vessel through a kind of ‘internal framework’. As the structural elements of the wreck were made from the locally-available wood [[Acacia]] Totilis/Radiana, it is thought{{who|date=December 2013}} that shipwreck 43 was [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] in origin and thus probably involves a shipbuilding tradition that developed in accordance with the availability of local supplies of timber and the realities of nautical life at the margins of the [[Nile Delta]].

===The Western Marmarica Coastal Survey===
The OCMA supports the Western Marmarica Coastal Survey (WMCS) to investigate the engagement of the Roman and Byzantine countryside with coastal trade in eastern [[Libya]].&lt;ref&gt;Hulin, L. et al. (2008-2010). Reports in ''Libyan Studies'' 39-41 (Winter 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The region east of [[Tobruk]] was populated by small farms and villages, most of whom exported their produce in amphora made in their own kilns. Although the area lacked the environmental resources to develop into a major centre, it is not isolated. A range of archaeological finds suggest connections, at different times, to [[Cyrenaica]], ca. 250&amp;nbsp;km west and to the [[Egypt]]ian delta, some 600&amp;nbsp;km to the east, as well as contacts across the eastern [[Mediterranean]] to the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], and through the [[Sahara]] to west [[Africa]] or the [[Sudan]].

==Conferences and publication==
The Oxford Centre for Maritime Archaeology publishes a monograph series as part of the Institute of Archaeology’s publication programme. The OCMA oversees the scholarly publication of the fieldwork conducted by the IEASM in Alexandria and the submerged Canopic region, as well as post-excavation studies of the material culture recovered from these excavations by IEASM specialists and Hilti Foundation sponsored post-graduate students. The OCMA regularly organizes conferences exploring themes within maritime archaeology or relating to the fieldwork of the IEASM. Volumes arising out of these conferences are also included in the monograph series.

Each volume is assessed by an internal review committee comprising principal members of staff from the Institute of Archaeology, the Oriental Institute, the Classics Centre and the [[Ashmolean Museum]], and are also peer-reviewed.

'''Pavlok''' is a wearable device that uses [[operant conditioning]] through [[haptic feedback]] to modify behavior. Users are said to be able to break bad habits by pairing the behavior with up to 150 [[volts]] of "zaptic feedback", and can establish new routines by pairing the behavior with vibration.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://buy.pavlok.com/pages/frontpage|title=Pavlok: Frontpage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Pavlok is a Behavioral Technology Group product, created by [[Maneesh Sethi]], an author and television personality. Sethi was previously known for his writing as [[Editor-in-chief]] of ''Hack The System'', a series of articles and guides on establishing a [[passive income]] and being productive.

In 2012, Sethi was featured on [[Daily News (New York)|NY Daily News]], [[CNET]], [[Huffington Post]], and other news outlets for hiring a woman off of [[Craigslist]] to slap him across the face whenever he was distracted from his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/blogger-hires-woman-slap-procrastinates-article-1.1186931|title=Blogger hires woman to slap him when he procrastinates|last=Roberts|first=Christine|date=October 18, 2012|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/man-hires-woman-to-slap-him-every-time-hes-on-facebook/|title=Man hires woman to slap him every time he's on Facebook|newspaper=[[CNET]]|author=Matyszczyk, Chris|date=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/18/maneesh-sethi-blogger-hires-craigslist-slapper-to-hit-him-unproductive_n_1980274.html|title=Maneesh Sethi, San Francisco Blogger, Hires Craigslist Slapper To Hit Him For Productivity|author=Bennett-Smith, Meredith|date=October 18, 2012|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed with the observable effects of [[operant conditioning]], Sethi founded Behavioral Technology Group in July of the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://hackthesystem.com/blog/pavlok-revealed-wednesday-beta-test-the-first-habit-training-devices/|author=Sethi, Maneesh|title=Pavlok Revealed: Beta-test the first habit-training device|date=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardware==

Pavlok has two main hardware components: the wristband and the removable module.

===Wristband===
Pavlok's wristband is one size fits all, and is made with [[silicone]]. As of July 2015, Pavlok offers colored wristbands for separate purchase in blue, red, pink, and gray.

===Module===

The module is made to fit inside the wristband, and is constructed to prevent accidental disassembling. Inside of the module is a [[Bluetooth_Low_Energy| Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)]] unit and a [[rechargeable battery]]. Pavlok synchronizes data with the user's cellphone via [[Bluetooth_Low_Energy|BLE]]. The battery is specified to typically last around 3-6 days on a single charge and is charged via a [[micro USB|micro USB port]]. The zapping voltage is adjustable from 150 to 450 [[Volt]].&lt;ref&gt;Pavlok instructions https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810wmdhDgrS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==

Pavlok currently offers a private beta app for [[iOS]], acting as a remote control for the device via [[Bluetooth]]. The full app (still in development) includes a five-day audio course in [[Aversion therapy|aversion conditioning]], with custom sessions tailored specifically for [[smoking]], [[nail-biting]], and [[Binge eating|overeating]].

Pavlok is built with an [[open API]] in order to encourage users to synchronize their data with third-party health and [[fitness app]]s. Interaction with original and third-party applications is incorporated with Pavlok's unique [[payment system]], referred to as "Volts".

==Volts==
In 2014, Pavlok established its own [[digital currency]]. Users can earn Volts for their activity on the Pavlok application, such as completing an audio course or reaching a [[goal]]. Volts are an internet-based [[medium of exchange]], and can be redeemed for additional in-app courses and modules. Pavlok uses this [[payment system]] to leverage [[behavioral economics]] and improve its capacity to modify behavior, as financial incentives have been shown to enhance success in [[smoking cessation]], grade performance, and other endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1503200"|title=Nudging Smokers|author=Cass Sunstein|newspaper=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://rady.ucsd.edu/docs/faculty/Levitt_et_al_Behavioralist_School_NBER_WP18165.pdf|title=The Behavioralist Goes to School|author=Levitt, Steven D.|newspaper=NBER Working Paper Series|date=June 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shark Tank ==
In May 2016, Pavlok was featured on ABC's Shark Tank Season 7 Finale. Sethi asked the sharks for $500,000 for 3.14% equity, valuing Pavlok at nearly $16 million. Kevin O'Leary offered Maneesh $500,000 for 3.14% of Pavlok by way of a 2 year balloon loan at 7.5%. Maneesh Sethi, founder of Pavlok, declined the offer. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank/episode-guide/season-07/29-episode-29|title=Shark Tank: Episode 29 - Watch Season 7 Episode 29|website=ABC|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

Behavioral Technology Group is included on [[Entrepreneur Magazine|Entrepreneur Magazine's]] 2015 list of ''100 Brilliant Companies to Watch''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/245890|newspaper=Entrepreneur|title=100 Brilliant Companies to Watch|date=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, Pavlok was named a finalist in the [[MassChallenge]] accelerator program.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://masschallenge.org/startups/2015/profile/pavlok-wear-your-willpower|title=2015 Startup Profile: Pavlok}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pavlok was a winner in the 2015 [[Shopify]] Build a Business Competition for having the most sales in a year within the [[Electronics]] &amp; [[Gadget|Gadgets]] category.

'''Pejeng drum''' (also Pejeng-type drum) is a type of Bronze Age kettledrum which was produced across the archipelago of [[Indonesia]] between the 1st and 2nd century AD. They are one of Indonesia's finest example of metalworking.{{sfn|Bellwood|2001|p=39}} Examples of Bronze Age Pejeng drum, such as the ancient [[Moon of Pejeng]], is the largest [[bronze drum]] in the world, indicating the advance of metal casting technique and the active trade in the archipelago in the first millennium AD.

==Archaeology==
[[File:MET 29G A30R4.jpg|thumb|right|The separately-cast head (the tympanum) of a Pejeng-type drum found in [[Sumba]].]]
The first record of the use of bronze and iron in the Indonesian archipelago was around 500 BC. Most of the earliest bronze objects were probably used for ceremonies e.g. [[Indonesian bronze age axes|highly-stylized axes]] and [[kettledrum]]s. Some drums were shaped in a form known as the [[Dong Son drum|Dong Son]], a type of bronze drum which originate from northern Vietnam and are spread along the [[Sunda Islands]] e.g. [[Sumatra]], [[Java]], [[Nusa Tenggara]] and even as far as the [[Kai Islands]] near [[Papua (province)|Papua]]. The spread of the Dong Son drum in the Indonesian archipelago indicates an extensive trade among the kingdoms in [[Southeast Asia]] during the period. Other bronze drums found in the archipelago represented local variation, the most well-known of these are the Pejeng drums.{{sfn|Bellwood|2001|p=39}}

The Pejeng drums, named after the Bronze Age village of [[Pejeng]] in [[Bali]], were the [[Nusantara|Indonesian]] variation of the Dong Son drum. Pejeng drums differ from the earlier [[Dong Son drum]] in that they had a more elongated shape and were made in two pieces (mantles and tympana) cast separately using the lost wax method. Pejeng drum was designed in the Indonesian archipelago and was produced extensively in the island of [[Java]] and [[Bali]] in the first millennium AD. The Balinese variation is among the most impressive metal artifact in the late prehistoric period of Indonesia. The [[Moon of Pejeng]] kept in the village of Pejeng, is the largest Pejeng drum in the world. Such enormous drum would have had great social value for the owners. Neither copper nor tin, the raw materials for bronze making, are available in Bali. The existence of huge bronze drums in Bali indicates an intensive inter-island trade between Bali and other parts of Indonesia during the first millennium AD. Trade was also more expansive in Bali, as pottery decorated with Indian-styled rouletted designs, were found at Sembiran and [[Pacung]] in the north part of Bali, indicating a trade as far as India within the archipelago in the 1st or 2nd centuries AD.{{sfn|I Wayan Kartika|2001|p=43}}

Pejeng drums may have been used as a regalia by kings or chiefs who wanted to be considered an international elite. At [[Plawangan]], a Pejeng drum was found in burials, together with other precious objects e.g. gold necklace and iron spearhead. In Bali, the [[Moon of Pejeng]], the largest drum of this type, was simply kept in villages.{{sfn|I Wayan Kartika|2001|p=43}} The [[Moko drum]] of Alor, a Pejeng-type drum, are still used as heirloom objects which are exchanged in marriage ceremonies.

==Appearance and construction==
[[File:MET 2001 433 93 O1 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The Pejeng drum.]]
A Pejeng drum has a symmetrical appearance. Its shape consists of three parts: the head or the tympanum at the top, the middle barrel where the handle is attached, and the base. The design difference between the Pejeng drum and the Dong Son drum is that the tympanum protrudes around {{convert|25|cm|inch}} beyond the body, and was cast separately from it.{{sfn|I Wayan Kartika|2001|p=43}}

Pejeng drums were made using [[lost-wax casting]]. Another difference with the [[Dong Son drum]] is that the body and tympana of the Pejeng drum were sometimes cast separately instead of as a whole. A wax model in the shape of a drum was made around a hollow clay core. The standardized geometric pattern of human or animal were impressed into the wax using incised stone molds. The geometric patterns were molded onto for the tympana and the upper sides.{{sfn|Bellwood|2001|p=38}}

The '''pericycle''' is a cylinder of [[Ground tissue#Parenchyma|parenchyma]] or [[sclerenchyma]] cells that lies just inside the [[endodermis]] and is the outer most part of the [[stele (biology)|stele]] of plants.

Although it is composed of non-vascular parenchyma cells, it is still considered part of the vascular cylinder because it arises from the procambium as do the vascular tissues it surrounds.

In [[eudicots]], it also has the capacity to produce [[lateral roots]].  Branch roots arise from this primary [[meristem]] tissue. In plants undergoing [[secondary growth]], the pericycle contributes to the [[vascular cambium]] often diverging into a [[cork cambium]].

In [[angiosperms]] certain molecules within the [[endodermis]] and the surrounding vasculature are sent to the pericycle which promotes the growth of the root [[meristem]]s.

== Location ==

The pericycle is located between the endodermis and phloem in plant roots.  In dicot stems, it is situated around the ring of vascular bundles in the stele.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.03.031 |pmid=24845660 |title=Pericycle |journal=Current Biology |volume=24 |issue=10 |pages=R378–9 |year=2014 |last1=Beeckman |first1=Tom |last2=De Smet |first2=Ive }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==

In dicot roots, the pericycle strengthens the roots and provides protection for the [[vascular bundle]]s.

In dicot root, the vascular cambium is completely secondary in origin, and it originates from a portion of pericycle tissue.

The pericycle regulates the formation of lateral roots by rapidly dividing near the xylem elements of the root.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7588064 |url=http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7588064 |year=1995 |author1=Laskowski |first1=M. J. |title=Formation of lateral root meristems is a two-stage process |journal=Development |volume=121 |issue=10 |pages=3303–10 |last2=Williams |first2=M. E. |last3=Nusbaum |first3=H. C. |last4=Sussex |first4=I. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been known to often be confused with other parts of the plant. However, its unique ring structure allows it to be more easily identified.

Past efforts to isolate such tissue have been successful. Monocot roots rarely branch, but can, and this branch will originate from the pericycle.

The '''Pisa Griffin''' is a large bronze sculpture of a [[griffin]], a mythical beast, which has been in [[Pisa]] in Italy since the Middle Ages, though it is of [[Islamic art|Islamic]] origin.  It is the largest medieval Islamic metal sculpture known, at over three feet tall (42.5&amp;nbsp;inches, or 1.07 m.), and was probably created in the 11th century in [[Al-Andalus]] (Islamic Spain).&lt;ref&gt;Quantara; Hoffman, 318&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been described as the "most famous as well as the most beautiful and monumental example" of a tradition of zoomorphic bronzes in Islamic art.&lt;ref&gt;Yale, 210&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (Cathedral Museum), Pisa.

==Description==
The griffin has the head of an [[eagle]]; but it has ears like those of a [[horse]] as well as the [[wattle (anatomy)|wattles]] of a [[rooster]], wings, and the body of a lion, or other mammal(s), with toes. Its dimensions are: height 107&amp;nbsp;cm; length 87&amp;nbsp;cm; width 43&amp;nbsp;cm. It is made of [[casting|cast]] bronze (i.e. [[copper alloy]]) with the wings cast separately and held in place by [[rivet]]s; it is largely hollow inside. There is an engraved decoration, including an Arabic inscription in [[Kufic script|Kufic]] letters round the beast's chest and flanks saying: "Perfect benediction, complete wellbeing, perfect joy, eternal peace and perfect health, and happiness and good fortune (?) for the owner".&lt;ref&gt;Quantara&lt;/ref&gt;  The wings are decorated with stylized [[feathers]], the chest with overlapping semi-circular [[Scale (anatomy)|scales]], and the back with a pattern of plain circles enclosed in two rings, on a textured background.  At the top of each leg there is a more elaborate, inverted teardrop-shaped zone or [[cartouche]], where [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]s surround an animal, lions on each front leg and birds, presumably eagles, on each rear one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_superzoom.php?im_id=3525 Quantara] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326172753/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_superzoom.php?im_id=3525 |date=2012-03-26 }}, moveable zoom, close-up image], see Quantara text also.&lt;/ref&gt;  

There are three openings to the interior of the statue, which contains fittings given various interpretations, described below. There are openings at the mouth, rear – perhaps for a missing tail – and a larger one under the belly. Inside is "a globular “cup” made of bronze, open towards the belly and soldered on the back with a fine piece of the same metal".&lt;ref&gt;Quantara&lt;/ref&gt;

The griffin is the largest of a group of surviving Islamic bronze animals, most of which are much smaller and functioned as [[aquamanile]]s, [[Censer|incense-burners]] and the like, and whose origin goes back to pre-Islamic [[Sassanian]] vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Yale, 66, 210&lt;/ref&gt; A much smaller group of middle-sized works contains several that were clearly fountainheads, probably originally arranged in circular groups facing outwards, in the manner of the famous stone lions still in place at the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]].&lt;ref&gt;"Christie's hind"; Spain, 80-84&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the group of non-portable early Islamic bronze animals, two have been sold in recent years, both clearly made as fountainheads: a lion, perhaps from [[Sicily]] and rather later in date, was sold for £1,546,650 at [[Sotheby's]] in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/lot/LotDetail.jsp?lot_id=3VJ2R A bronze fountainhead in the form of a lion, Mediterranean, probably South Italy, second half 12th century], Sotheby's lot description, Sale: L02221, London, Session 1: Wed, 16 Oct 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and a 10th-century hind (female deer) from Cordoba, which realized £3,631,500 in 1997 at [[Christie's]].&lt;ref&gt;"Christie's hind"; the one now (?) in the [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha]], [[Qatar]], see Cordoba Stag below&lt;/ref&gt;  This latter is said to be a companion of the "Cordoba Stag", the best known of the group after the Pisa Griffin, which is now 61.6&amp;nbsp;cm high, though lacking the [[antler]]s it is presumed to have originally had, and dates to ca. 950–1000.  It is in the Museo Arqueológico Provincial de Cordoba, and was found in the ruins of the large palace-city [[Madinat Al-Zahra]] outside Cordoba.&lt;ref&gt;Cordoba Stag: Jones and Mitchell, 167, cat. 172;[http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=209 "Spout of a fountain in the form of a stag"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326172742/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=209 |date=2012-03-26 }}, Quantara; [http://www.learn.columbia.edu/ma/htm/dj_islam/ma_dj_image_rel_obj03.htm Image of the Cordoba Stag]&lt;/ref&gt; Another, not matching, hind fountainhead from Madinat Al-Zahra is in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]] in Madrid (right); the 16th century historian [[Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari|al-Maqqari]] mentions "...marble basins with elaborate spouts at the palace of Madinat al-Zahra'. One of these was surrounded by twelve gold animal sculptures which spewed water from their mouths".&lt;ref&gt;"Christie's hind"&lt;/ref&gt;  Smaller pieces are the "Kassel Lion" signed by Abd Allah Mattial from the 10th or 11th century ([[Kassel]] Museum),&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Mitchell, 165, cat. 168&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Monzon lion" in the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=1037&amp;lang=en Lion with an articulated tail], the "Monzon Lion" on Quantara&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the griffin too might have been placed in a fountain, with water spouting from its mouth, but a more recent theory, based on the remains of its internal features, is that both it and a smaller lion in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, were in fact designed to emit noises from their mouth, as a kind of mechanical toy of a sort known to have been enjoyed in Islamic courts.&lt;ref&gt;Quantara; A. Contadini, R. Camber, P. Northover, ''Beasts that Roared: The Pisa Griffin and the New York Lion'' (not seen) sets out this theory&lt;/ref&gt;

Locating the area where the griffin was made has been the subject of considerable dedate, with Al-Andalus, Egypt, Sicily, North Africa and other places suggested at various points. Debate focuses on a group of bronzes of one sort or another that are often thought to have been made in the same area. Al-Andalus remains the most popular choice, but South Italy or Sicily are possible, though Egypt seems to have largely fallen out of contention.&lt;ref&gt;Quantara; [http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=1879640 "A SPANISH ISLAMIC DOOR KNOCKER, 11TH CENTURY"] Christie's Lot description and notes. Sale 6373, ISLAMIC ART AND MANUSCRIPTS, 10 October 2000
London, King Street; see also "Christie's hind".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Hillenbrand]] suggests that the fantastic nature of the griffin and other statues of animals was influenced by a belief that such mythical beasts were less likely to be regarded as idolatrous than lifelike animal forms.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand&lt;/ref&gt; All representations of animals were [[aniconism in Islam|against strict interpretations of Islam]], and three-dimensional ones, especially when large, were especially likely to be accused of skirting [[idolatry]], and are rare in [[Islamic art]]. An aquamanile in the [[Hermitage Museum]] of a cow and calf attacked by a lion has later had the throats of the animals cut with a sharp groove, apparently to make it clear that they are dead.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Mitchell, 169, cat 178; [https://books.google.com/books?id=EuxsKUAY0qAC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=Aquamanile&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OvHTTY6sO4fOswaqm-TkAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Aquamanile&amp;f=false full account here]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oleg Grabar]] suggests that the engraved decoration may be "translations into cheaper bronze" of inlays and enamelling found on gold and silver Byzantine objects.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oleg Grabar|Grabar, Oleg]] ''Early Islamic art, 650-1100, Volume 1 Constructing the study of Islamic art'', p. 238, Ashgate/Variorum, 2005, {{ISBN|0-86078-921-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-86078-921-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The circular patterns on the griffin's back and several of the other works mentioned above derive from textile designs.&lt;ref&gt;"Christie's hind"&lt;/ref&gt;

The griffin is generally agreed to have arrived in Pisa at some point during the late 11th or early 12th century, and may have been a spoil of one of the many successful "wars" or raids conducted by the [[Republic of Pisa]] against Islamic states at this period, when the small city was at the height of its power as a [[maritime republic]]. The successful attack in 1087 on [[Mahdia]] in modern [[Tunisia]], capital of the local [[Zirid dynasty]] is one candidate.&lt;ref&gt;Yale, 210.  Other possibilities are the [[Pisan–Genoese expeditions to Sardinia (1015–1016)]] and [[1113–1115 Balearic Islands expedition]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The griffin was placed on a platform on top of a column rising from the [[gable]] above the [[apse]] at the east end of [[Pisa Cathedral]], probably as part of the original construction, which was begun in 1064.  This was a very prominent position, but one that meant that it could not be seen close up, and its Islamic origins were forgotten over the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, 3&lt;/ref&gt;  According to later local legends it was variously said to be Roman, a local medieval creation, a spoil of war [[1113–1115 Balearic Islands expedition|from 1115]], or miraculously found when the foundations of the cathedral were being excavated.&lt;ref&gt;Quantara; Mack, 181–182, note 5&lt;/ref&gt;  Large-scale  European bronze casting at this period specialized in fonts and pairs of doors, of which there is a fine Romanesque pair with [[relief]]s in the same museum.

In 1828 the griffin was removed and placed in the Cathedral Museum, with a replica later placed in the original position.  Once seen closely, the [[Kufic]] inscription made its Islamic origins plain, although [[John Murray (publisher)|Murray's Handbook]] for Italy in 1861 fantasized that: "Though Arabian, it is as clearly not Mahometan, and it is most probably an idol or a talisman belonging to the Druzes, or some other of the tribes who even still secretly reject the doctrines of the Koran".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ymwDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=Pisa+griffon&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jMnRTaXpIYbKswaOn-iXCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Pisa%20griffon&amp;f=false ''Handbook for travellers in central Italy''], by O. Blewitt, p. 49, 1861, John Murray&lt;/ref&gt;  Debate about the place and date of its creation continues to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Quantara, and see above.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Pisa the griffin joined other trophy pieces of prestigious bronze sculpture displayed at the heart of the civic space, like (later) the [[Horses of St Mark]] and the lion on a column in the [[Piazza San Marco|Piazzetta]] in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; In Pisa it forms a part of probably the most famous ensemble of [[Romanesque architecture]] in Italy in the ''[[Piazza dei Miracoli]]'', looking at the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]], with the [[Baptistry (Pisa)|Bapistry]] behind it.  

In recent years the griffin has travelled to exhibitions in [[Berlin]] in 1989, Granada, New York in 1992, and Brigham Young University in Provo in 2012.  

There is an ongoing interdisciplinary project on the Pisa Griffin and related metalwork and material culture, in collaboration with Oxford University, Pisa University, [[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche|CNR]]-[[Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione|ISTI]] in Pisa, Opera della Primaziale Pisana, and the [[Istituto Superiore per la Conservazione ed il Restauro]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/griffin/ The Pisa Griffin Project]&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the outcomes of the project there will be an accurate digital 3D model of the statue obtained through [[3D scanning]], videos, a book and an exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soas.ac.uk/staff/staff30791.php Dr Anna Contadini], [[SOAS]], London&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21102">The '''rabbinical translations of Matthew''' are rabbinical versions of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] that are written in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]; ''Shem-Tob's Matthew'', the ''Du Tillet Matthew'', and the ''Münster Matthew'', and which were used in polemical debate with Catholics.

These versions are to be distinguished from the [[Gospel of the Hebrews]] which was one or more works found in the [[Early Church]], but surviving only as fragmentary quotations in Greek and Latin texts.

Some scholars consider all the rabbinical versions to be translated from the Greek or Latin of the canonical Matthew, for the purpose of Jewish apologetics.&lt;ref&gt;Brown&lt;/ref&gt;  This conclusion is not exclusive.  Other scholars have provided linguistic and historic evidence of Shem Tov's Matthew coming from a much earlier Hebrew text that was later translated into Greek and other languages.  Early Christian author Papias wrote around the year 100 that,  "Matthew composed his history in the Hebrew dialect, and everyone translated it as he was able".&lt;ref&gt;Gordon&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Howard&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rabbinical Jewish versions==
===Early Rabbinical citations of Matthew, 600-1300===
Quotations from Hebrew translations of portions of various New Testament books - including the epistles of Paul - can be found in rabbinical treatises against Catholicism. These treatises multiplied wherever Jews lived in proximity to Christians - such as Spain before the [[History of the Jews in Spain|expulsion of the Jews from Spain]] in 1492.

* ''[[Toledot Yeshu]]''; "Life of Jesus", 7th century.
* ''[[Milhamoth ha-Shem]]''; "Wars of the Lord" of Jacob Ben Reuben 12th century, which cites texts including Matthew 1:1-16, 3:13-17, 4:1-11, 5:33-40, 11:25-27, 12:1-8, 26:36-39, 28:16-20.

Jean Carmignac (Paris 1969, BNES 1978) identified fifty Hebrew translations of the [[Lord's Prayer]] from the 9th to the 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;"Hebrew Translations of the Lord's Prayer: An Historical Survey. BNES 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Josef Petuchowski, Michael Brocke ''The Lord's Prayer and Jewish liturgy'' 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans ''Jesus and His Contemporaries: Comparative Studies'' 2001 p294 "Carmignac ("Hebrew Translations," 21-49) provides fifty Hebrew translations of the Lord's prayer ranging from the ninth to the eighteenth centuries, as well as many more from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars consider that the medieval Hebrew manuscripts are derived by translation from medieval Greek or Latin manuscripts, and therefore that it is extremely unlikely that any of the unique readings found in these medieval Hebrew manuscripts could be ancient.&lt;ref&gt;Petersen 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Four principal versions in rabbinical Hebrew of Matthew have survived or partially survived:

===Shem Tov's ''Matthew'', 1385===
[[File:Shemtobfirstpage.gif|thumb|240px|Shem Tov first page]]
The '''Shem Tov Matthew''' (or '''Shem Tob's Matthew''') consists of a complete text of [[Gospel of Matthew]] in the [[Hebrew language]] found interspersed among anti-Catholic commentary in the 12th volume of a polemical treatise ''The Touchstone'' (c.1380-85) by [[Shem Tov ben Isaac ben Shaprut]] (Ibn Shaprut), a Jewish physician living in [[Aragon]], after whom the version is named. Shem Tov debated Cardinal Pedro de Luna (later [[Antipope Benedict XIII]]) on [[original sin]] and redemption in Pamplona, December 26, 1375, in the presence of bishops and learned theologians. Nine manuscripts of ''The Touchstone'' survive, though if an independent version of the text of Matthew used by Ibn Shaprut ever existed then it is lost. 

Spanish Jews of Ibn Shaprut's period were familiar with the New Testament in Latin. Jacob Ben Reuben in his ''[[Milhamoth ha-Shem|Wars of the Lord]]'' translated [[Gilbert Crispin]]'s ''Disputation of Jews and Christians'' from Latin into Hebrew, along with quotes from Matthew. Lasker (1998) remarks that "By the fourteenth century, most likely every Iberian anti-Christian Jewish polemicist knew Latin." [[Moses ha-Kohen de Tordesillas]] made proficient use of Latin phrases. Profiat Duran (fl.1380-1420) had extensive knowledge of Latin Christian texts, and devoted a chapter of his ''Disgrace of the Gentiles'' (Klimat ha-goyim) to criticism of Jerome's [[Latin Vulgate]]. [[Hayyim ben Judah ibn Musa]] argued with [[Nicholas de Lyra]] in his ''Book of Shield and Spear'' (Sefer magen va-romah).&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Lasker in ''In Iberia and beyond: Hispanic Jews between cultures'' ed. Bernard Dov Cooperman 1998 p176&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise converts to Christianity such as [[Abner of Burgos]] ([[Alphonso of Valladolid]], ca. 1270-1347) continued to write polemical, theological, philosophical, and scientific works in Hebrew. 

Shem Tov's ''The Touchstone'' (''Eben = stone, bohan = test'') has never been translated into English or published. It follows the model of ''[[Milhamoth ha-Shem]]'' of Jacob Ben Reuben in use of Matthew but contains not just sections of Matthew as Jacob Ben Reuben, but the whole text of Matthew and parts of Mark. [[George Howard (Hebraist)|George Howard]] excised the text of Matthew from among Shem Tov's comments and published it separately as ''The Gospel of Matthew according to a primitive Hebrew text'' (1987), a revised version ''Hebrew Gospel of Matthew'' (1995).&lt;ref&gt;William Horbury Appendix pp729 in ''A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Gospel According to Saint Matthew'' ed. . D. Davies, William David Davies, Dale C. Allison&lt;/ref&gt;

Shem Tov's quotations of Matthew in ''The Touchstone'' are marked by [[Judaism|Jewish]] thought, and are interspaced with the comments of the author. As a consequence several scholars{{Who|date=January 2011}} feel it is difficult to determine which parts are Shem Tov's commentary, and which parts are the actual text of the source he was quoting. Many scholars{{Who|date=January 2011}} view the text as a mediaeval translation from the Greek text of the Gospel of Matthew, as well as being the likely source of all later Hebrew versions of Matthew prior to the 20th century.

Where the [[Tetragrammaton]] occurs in [[Tanakh]] quotations, instead one finds a single Hebrew ''[[He (letter)|He]]'' (ה) except in one place where the word "ha-shem" (השם, the name) is spelled out. There are some interesting readings of Matthew in ''The Touchstone''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rosetta.reltech.org/TC/vol03/Petersen1998a.html Some Observations on a Recent Edition of and Introduction to Shem-Tob's "Hebrew Matthew"]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Matt 12:37 "According to your words you will be judged, and according to your deeds you will be convicted."
* Matt 24:40-41 "40 Then if there shall be two ploughing in a field, one righteous and the other evil, the one will be taken and the other left. 41 Two women will be grinding at a mill; one will be taken and the other left. This is because the angels at the end of the world will remove the stumbling blocks from the world and will separate the good from the evil."
* Matt 28:9 "As they were going Jesus passed before them saying: 'May the Name deliver you.'"
* Matt 28:19-20 "Go and teach them to carry out all the things which I have commanded you forever."
* Mark 9:20-28 is placed into the text of Matthew between Matt 17:17 and 17:19.  Matt 17:18 is omitted.&lt;ref&gt;http://rosetta.reltech.org/TC/vol03/Petersen1998a.html Some Observations on a Recent Edition of and Introduction to Shem-Tob's "Hebrew Matthew"&lt;/ref&gt;

While the quotations in Shem Tov's ''The Touchstone'', which are interspersed in his own commentary, diverge from the canonical text of Matthew, the text of the ''Münster Matthew'' and the ''Du Tillet Matthew'' are significantly very close to it in many passages.

===Sebastian Münster's ''Matthew,'' 1537===
The '''Münster Matthew''' is a printed version of the [[Gospel of Matthew]], written in the [[Hebrew language]]  published by [[Sebastian Münster]] in 1537 and dedicated to King Henry VIII of England. He had received the text from Spanish Jews he had converted to Christianity in the 1530s.{{cn|date=May 2013}} Apparently, these Jews had been using the text to understand the Christian religion in order to counter it. Münster felt that the text was defective, and set about reworking it. The original manuscript he received no longer exists; only his printed reworking of it survives, and it closely resembles the ''Du Tillet Matthew''. Because the places where Münster changed the text is unknown, this text can be difficult to use for [[textual criticism]].

===Jean du Tillet's ''Matthew,'' 1555===
The '''Du Tillet Matthew''' is a version of the [[Gospel of Matthew]], written in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], known as Heb.MSS.132, and residing in the National Library, Paris. The manuscript was obtained by Bishop [[Jean du Tillet]] from Italian Jews on a visit to [[Rome]] in 1553, and published in 1555, with editing by [[Jean Mercier (Hebraist)]] and addition of a Latin version, dedicated to cardinal Charles de Guise. 

While the text is less divergent from the Greek textual tradition than is the ''Shem Tov Matthew'', this version share some deviations in common with the ''Shem Tov Matthew''; for example, the [[Tetragrammaton]] is replaced with a sign composed of three [[yodh]]s or dots enclosed in a semicircle. [[Jean Cinqarbres]] (Quinquarboreus), Hebrew professor of the College Royal also worked on the Du Tillet Matthew.

===Rahabi Ezekiel's ''Matthew,'' 1750===
Rabbi [[Rahabi Ezekiel]]'s ''Ha-sepher shel we-'angilu shel ha-Nosarim shel Yeshu'' [The book of the Gospel belonging to the followers of Jesus] is a polemical translation of Matthew dating from 1750.&lt;ref&gt;Pinchas Lapide ''Hebrew in the church: the foundations of Jewish-Christian dialogue'' 1984&lt;/ref&gt; This may or may not be the same as the polemical rabbinical Hebrew New Testament of Rabbi Ezekiel bought by Claudius Buchanan in [[Cochin]] and known as the "Travancore Hebrew New Testament", which led Buchanan to urge [[Joseph Frey]] to commence work on a Christian translation.&lt;ref&gt;Shalom Goldman ''God's sacred tongue: Hebrew &amp; the American imagination'' p108  2004 "In Travancore he purchased a large collection of Hebrew manuscripts that included both a chronicle of the Jews of Cochin and a Hebrew New Testament. Buchanan identified the translator of the New Testament as one Rabbi Ezekiel,"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elias Soloweyczyk's ''Matthew,'' 1869===
{{main|Elias Soloweyczyk}}

==Christian Hebrew versions==
Around half of the 20 known Christian translations of Matthew were also done by authors who were formerly rabbis, or came from a rabbinical training: [[Domenico Gerosolimitano]] and [[Giovanni Battista Jona]], [[Rudolph Bernhard]], [[Johan Kemper]], Simon Rosenbaum (of Uppsala),&lt;ref&gt;Biblical and Near Eastern studies: essays in honor of William  Sanford La Sor, Gary A. Tuttle - 1978 "1727 Simon Rosenbaum: Uppsala, O. Hebr. 31, p. 7ro This translation of the New Testament up to Gal 2:15 is in fact anonymous, but has been attributed to Simon Rosenbaum, the successor of Johan Kemper, by Hans Joachim Schoeps"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian David Ginsburg]] and [[Yitzhak Salkinsohn|Isaac Salkinson]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean Carmignac, "Hebrew Translations of the Lord's Prayer: A Historical Survey," in ''Biblical and Near Eastern studies: essays in honor of William Sanford LaSor'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1979), pp. 18."My list of translators (or editors) is as follows: [[Shem Tob ben Shafrut]], [[Sebastian Munster]], [[Jean Cinqarbres]], [[Jean du Tillet]], [[Marco Marini]](?), [[Elias Hutter]], [[Domenico Gerosolimitano]], [[Georg Mayr]] [Bavarian Jesuit 1564-1623], [[Giovanni Battista Jona]], [[William Robertson (Hebraist)]], [[Rudolph Bernhard]], [[Johannes Kemper]], [[Simon Rosenbaum]], [[Ezekiel Rahabi]], [[Richard Caddick]], [[Thomas Yeates (orientalist)]], [[The London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews]], [[William Greenfield]], [[Robert Young (Biblical scholar)]],  [[Elias Soloweyczyk]], [[Franz Delitzsch]], [[Yitzhak Salkinsohn|Isaac Salkinson]] and [[J. M. Paul Bauchet]]."&lt;/ref&gt; However the principal modern Hebrew version of Matthew is based on the New Testament of a German, [[Franz Delitzsch]].

==Shem Tov's ''Touchstone'' in Christian Aramaic primacy debate==
{{main|Aramaic primacy}}
The hypotheses of Hebrew and [[Aramaic primacy]] posit that the Gospel of Matthew was originally written in Hebrew or Aramaic. Scholars who support these hypotheses sometimes appeal to these 3 medieval Hebrew manuscripts. However, the vast majority of scholars believe Matthew was originally written in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1997, p. 210 "There are medieval Hebrew forms of Matt that most scholars think of as retroversions from the Greek of canonical Matt, often made to serve in arguments between Christians and Jews. However, some claim that these texts are a guide to the original Hebrew of Matt (French scholars like J. Carmignac and M. Dubarle have contributed to this thesis...) Still other scholars think they can reconstruct the original Hebrew or Aramaic underlying the whole or parts of the Greek text of canonical Matt on the assumption that the original was in Semitic... The vast majority of scholars, however, contend that the Gospel we know as Matt was composed originally in Greek and is not a translation of a Semitic original... Brown, Raymond E. An Introduction to the New Testament"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Howard (Hebraist)|George Howard]], Associate Professor of Religion and Hebrew at the [[University of Georgia]] has argued (1995) that some or all of these three medieval Hebrew versions may have descended (without any intervening translation) from ancient Hebrew manuscripts of Matthew, which may have been used by early Christians in the 1st or 2nd century, but were nearly extinct by the time of Jerome, late in the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Howard 1995&lt;/ref&gt; 

However the surviving citations from [[Jewish-Christian Gospels]] (namely [[Gospel of the Nazarenes]], [[Gospel of the Ebionites]] and [[Gospel of the Hebrews]]) preserved in the writings of [[Jerome]], [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] and others, lead critical scholars to conclude that those Gospels themselves either were Greek or were translated from Greek Matthew.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philipp Vielhauer]] section in NTA1&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, most scholars consider that the medieval Hebrew manuscripts were descended (by translation) from medieval Greek or Latin manuscripts, and therefore that it is extremely unlikely that any of the unique readings found in these medieval Hebrew manuscripts could be ancient.
&lt;ref&gt;Petersen 1998&lt;/ref&gt; 

Horbury (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Horbury W. ''Hebrew study from Ezra to Ben-Yehuda'' 1999 p129 "These features are probably to be explained, however, not, as Howard thinks, from the influence of a gospel in Hebrew current among the early Christians, but rather from the encounter of Jews over the years with various forms of gospel text in other languages;"&lt;/ref&gt; notes that the characteristics of ibn Shaprut's ''Touchstone'' are better explained by the influence of Latin Gospel harmonies.

==Patristic testimony==
{{main|Gospel of the Hebrews}}
There was a strong tradition in the early church, attested by [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Origen]], [[Eusebius]], [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]], and [[Jerome]], that Matthew had written a gospel in the Hebrew language (although some of them may have conflated Hebrew and Aramaic languages). Irenaeus, Epiphanius, and Jerome identify the Gospel of the Hebrews with this Hebrew gospel of Matthew.&lt;ref&gt;Schoemaker, W. R. (1902). The Gospel According to the Hebrews. The University of Chicago Press. p.199&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of Jerome, some commentators believed that the ''Gospel of the Hebrews'' was the original Gospel of Matthew.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, ''Commentary on Matthew'' 2 . 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] in the ''Panarion'' wrote that,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"They [Jewish Christians] too accept Matthew's gospel and like the followers of Cerinthus and Merinthus, they use it alone. They call it the ''Gospel of the Hebrews'', for in truth, Matthew alone of the New Covenant writers expounded and declared the gospel in Hebrew using Hebrew script."&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius, ''Panarion,'' 30 . 3 . 7&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Papias and the Hebrew Tradition of Matthew===
About whether Matthew was written in Hebrew, Papias (as quoted by Eusebius) wrote this:
: Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a regular narrative of the Lord's sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took especial care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything fictitious into the statements. Matthew put together the oracles [of the Lord] in the Hebrew language, and each one interpreted them as best he could.

Citing this text, many argue that Papias claimed that Matthew was written in the Hebrew language, (as it is often translated in English). However, Papias' comment in Greek, (Ματθαῖος μέν οὖν '''Ἑβραίδι διαλέκτῳ''' τά λόγια, "Hebrew dialect") is a common construction in Greek and is seen in many different sources and contexts and seems to consistently refer to a style or subset of a language being spoken; and, this is distinguished from the general Greek term for language or tongue, "γλῶσσα". Papias' statement seems to signify a style of language or dialect being used by the "Hebrews", (or in other words, the style or subset of a language being used by the Hebrew race). In the historical context, the "dialect of the Hebrews", (Ἑβραίδι διαλέκτῳ), was most probably a reference to Hebrew's congener, Aramaic.&lt;ref&gt;

Above the genetic level, regeneration is fundamentally regulated by asexual cellular processes.&lt;ref name="Brokes08"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brockes JP, Kumar A | title = Comparative aspects of animal regeneration | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 24 | pages = 525–49 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18598212 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.24.110707.175336 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regeneration is different from reproduction. For example, [[hydra (genus)|hydra]] perform regeneration but reproduce by the method of [[budding]].

The [[hydra (genus)|hydra]] and the [[planarian]] flatworm have long served as model organisms for their highly [[adaptation|adaptive]] regenerative capabilities.&lt;ref name="Sánchez00"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sánchez Alvarado A | title = Regeneration in the metazoans: why does it happen? | journal = BioEssays | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 578–90 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10842312 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1521-1878(200006)22:6&lt;578::AID-BIES11&gt;3.0.CO;2-# | url = http://planaria.neuro.utah.edu/publications/BioEssays.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once wounded, their cells become activated and start to remodel tissues and organs back to the pre-existing state.&lt;ref name="Reddien04"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddien PW, Sánchez Alvarado A | title = Fundamentals of planarian regeneration | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 20 | pages = 725–57 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15473858 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.20.010403.095114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Caudata]] ("urodeles"; [[salamander]]s and [[newt]]s), an [[Order (biology)|order]] of tailed [[amphibia]]ns, is possibly the most adept [[vertebrate]] group at regeneration, given their capability of regenerating limbs, tails, jaws, eyes and a variety of internal structures.&lt;ref name="Carlson07" /&gt; The regeneration of organs is a common and widespread adaptive capability among [[metazoa]]n creatures.&lt;ref name="Sánchez00" /&gt; In a related context, some animals are able to reproduce [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] through [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]], [[budding]], or [[fission (biology)|fission]].&lt;ref name="Brokes08" /&gt; A planarian parent, for example, will constrict, split in the middle, and each half generates a new end to form two [[Clone (cell biology)|clones]] of the original.&lt;ref name="Campbell_1996"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Campbell NA | title=Biology | edition=4th | year = 1996 | publisher=The Benjamin Cummings Publishing Company, Inc. | place=California | pages=1206 | isbn = 978-0-8053-1940-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Echinoderms]] (such as the sea star), crayfish, many reptiles, and amphibians exhibit remarkable examples of tissue regeneration. The case of [[autotomy]], for example, serves as a defensive function as the animal detaches a limb or tail to avoid capture. After the limb or tail has been autotomized, cells move into action and the tissues will regenerate.&lt;ref name="Wilkie01"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilkie IC | title = Autotomy as a prelude to regeneration in echinoderms | journal = Microscopy Research and Technique | volume = 55 | issue = 6 | pages = 369–96 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11782069 | doi = 10.1002/jemt.1185 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maiorana77"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maiorana VC | title=Tail autotomy, functional conflicts and their resolution by a salamander | journal=Nature | volume=2265 | issue=5594 | pages=533–535 | year=1977 | doi=10.1038/265533a0| bibcode=1977Natur.265..533M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maginnis06"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maginnis TL | title=The costs of autotomy and regeneration in animals: a review and framework for future research | journal=Behavioral Ecology | volume=7 | issue=5 | pages=857–872 | year=2006 | doi=10.1093/beheco/arl010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Limited regeneration of limbs occurs in most fishes and salamanders, and tail regeneration takes place in larval frogs and toads (but not adults). The whole limb of a salamander or a triton will grow again and again after amputation. In reptiles, chelonians, crocodilians and snakes are unable to regenerate lost parts, but many (not all) kinds of lizards, geckos and iguanas possess regeneration capacity in a high degree. Usually, it involves dropping a section of their tail and regenerating it as part of a defense mechanism. While escaping a predator, if the predator catches the tail, it will disconnect.&lt;ref name="UCSB Science Line"&gt;{{Cite web|title = UCSB Science Line|url = http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=1103|website = scienceline.ucsb.edu|access-date = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecosystems==
{{main|regeneration (ecology)}}

Ecosystems can be regenerative. Following a disturbance, such as a fire or pest outbreak in a forest, [[Pioneer species|pioneering species]] will occupy, compete for space, and establish themselves in the newly opened habitat. The new growth of seedlings and [[Assembly rules|community assembly]] process is known as regeneration in [[ecology]].&lt;ref name="Dietze08"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1890/07-0271.1 | vauthors = Dietze MC, Clark JS | title=Changing the gap dynamics paradigm: Vegetative regenerative control on forest response to disturbance | journal=Ecological Monographs | volume=78 | issue=3 | pages=331–347 | url=http://coweeta.uga.edu/publications/10300.pdf | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey02"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0378-1127(01)00564-3 | vauthors = Bailey J, Covington WW | title=Evaluation ponderosa pine regeneration rates following ecological restoration treatments in northern Arizona, USA | journal=Forest Ecology and Management | volume=155 | pages=271–278 | url= http://library.eri.nau.edu/gsdl/collect/erilibra/index/assoc/HASH0e9a.dir/doc.pdf | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cellular molecular fundamentals==
Pattern formation in the morphogenesis of an animal is regulated by [[Regulation of gene expression|genetic induction factors]] that put cells to work after damage has occurred. Neural cells, for example, express growth-associated proteins, such as [[GAP-43]], [[tubulin]], [[actin]], an array of novel [[neuropeptide]]s, and [[cytokines]] that induce a cellular physiological response to regenerate from the damage.&lt;ref name="Fu97"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fu SY, Gordon T | title = The cellular and molecular basis of peripheral nerve regeneration | journal = Molecular Neurobiology | volume = 14 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 67–116 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9170101 | doi = 10.1007/BF02740621 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the genes that are involved in the original development of tissues are reinitialized during the regenerative process. Cells in the [[Primordium|primordia]] of [[zebrafish]] fins, for example, express four genes from the [[homeobox]] ''msx'' family during development and regeneration.&lt;ref name="akimenko96"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Akimenko MA, Johnson SL, Westerfield M, Ekker M | title = Differential induction of four msx homeobox genes during fin development and regeneration in zebrafish | journal = Development | volume = 121 | issue = 2 | pages = 347–57 | date = February 1995 | pmid = 7768177 | url = http://dev.biologists.org/content/121/2/347.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tissues==
"Strategies include the rearrangement of pre-existing tissue, the use of adult [[Somatic cell|somatic]] [[stem cells]] and the dedifferentiation and/or transdifferentiation of cells, and more than one mode can operate in different tissues of the same animal.&lt;ref name="Birbrair 2298–2314"/&gt; All these strategies result in the re-establishment of appropriate tissue polarity, structure and form."&lt;ref name="Alvarado06"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sánchez Alvarado A, Tsonis PA | title = Bridging the regeneration gap: genetic insights from diverse animal models | journal = Nature Reviews. Genetics | volume = 7 | issue = 11 | pages = 873–84 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17047686 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1923 | url = http://planaria.neuro.utah.edu/publications/NRG2006.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|873}} During the developmental process, genes are activated that serve to modify the properties of [[Cell potency|cell]] as they differentiate into different tissues. Development and regeneration involves the coordination and organization of populations cells into a [[blastema]], which is "a mound of stem cells from which regeneration begins".&lt;ref name="Kumar07"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kumar A, Godwin JW, Gates PB, Garza-Garcia AA, Brockes JP | title = Molecular basis for the nerve dependence of limb regeneration in an adult vertebrate | journal = Science | volume = 318 | issue = 5851 | pages = 772–7 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17975060 | pmc = 2696928 | doi = 10.1126/science.1147710 | bibcode = 2007Sci...318..772K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dedifferentiation of cells means that they lose their tissue-specific characteristics as tissues remodel during the regeneration process. This should not be confused with the  transdifferentiation of cells which is when they lose their tissue-specific characteristics during the regeneration process, and then re-differentiate to a different kind of cell.&lt;ref name="Alvarado06" /&gt;

==In animals==

=== Arthropods ===
[[Arthropod]]s are known to regenerate appendages following loss or [[autotomy]].&lt;ref name="Skinner_1985"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Skinner DM | chapter = Molting and Regneration | veditors = Bliss DE, Mantel LH | title = Integument, Pigments, and Hormonal Processes | date = 1985 | volume = 9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JG1lh--v1sYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | publisher = Academic Press | isbn = 978-0-323-13922-9 | pages = 46–146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regeneration among arthropods is restricted by molting such that [[Hemimetabolism|hemimetabolous]] [[insect]]s are capable of regeneration only until their final [[Moulting|molt]] whereas most [[crustacean]]s can regenerate throughout their lifetimes.&lt;ref name="Seifert AW 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seifert AW, Monaghan JR, Smith MD, Pasch B, Stier AC, Michonneau F, Maden M | title = The influence of fundamental traits on mechanisms controlling appendage regeneration | journal = Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society | volume = 87 | issue = 2 | pages = 330–45 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 21929739 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-185X.2011.00199.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Molting cycles are hormonally regulated in arthropods,&lt;ref name="Travis_1955"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Molting Cycle of the Spiny Lobster, Panulirus argus Latreille.

===Annelids===

Many [[annelid]]s (segmented worms) are capable of regeneration.&lt;ref name=Bely2006&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bely AE | title = Distribution of segment regeneration ability in the Annelida | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 508–18 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 21672762 | doi = 10.1093/icb/icj051 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''[[Chaetopterus variopedatus]]'' and ''[[Branchiomma nigromaculata]]'' can regenerate both anterior and posterior body parts after latitudinal bisection.&lt;ref name=Hill1972&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hill SD | title = Caudal regeneration in the absence of a brain in two species of sedentary polychaetes | journal = Journal of Embryology and Experimental Morphology | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 667–80 | date = December 1972 | pmid = 4655324 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between [[somatic cell|somatic]] and [[germline]] stem cell regeneration has been studied at the molecular level in the annelid ''[[Capitella teleta]]''.&lt;ref name=Giani2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Giani VC, Yamaguchi E, Boyle MJ, Seaver EC | title = Somatic and germline expression of piwi during development and regeneration in the marine polychaete annelid Capitella teleta | journal = EvoDevo | volume = 2 | issue =  | pages = 10 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21545709 | pmc = 3113731 | doi = 10.1186/2041-9139-2-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Leeches]], however, appear incapable of segmental regeneration.&lt;ref name="Zoran"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Regeneration in Annelids | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|date = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-470-01590-2 | doi = 10.1002/9780470015902.a0022103 | first = Mark J | last = Zoran | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, their close relatives, the [[Branchiobdellida|branchiobdellids]], are also incapable of segmental regeneration.&lt;ref name="Zoran" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bely2006"/&gt; However, certain individuals, like the lumbriculids, can regenerate from only a few segments.&lt;ref name="Zoran" /&gt; Segmental regeneration in these animals is epimorphic and occurs through [[blastema]] formation.&lt;ref name="Zoran" /&gt; Segmental regeneration has been gained and lost during annelid evolution, as seen in [[oligochaetes]], where head regeneration has been lost three separate times.&lt;ref name="Zoran" /&gt;

Along with epimorphosis, some [[polychaetes]] like ''[[Sabella pavonina]]'' experience morphallactic regeneration.&lt;ref name="Zoran" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bely AE | title = Early events in annelid regeneration: a cellular perspective | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume = 54 | issue = 4 | pages = 688–99 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25122930 | doi = 10.1093/icb/icu109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Morphallaxis involves the de-differentiation, transformation, and re-differentation of cells to regenerate tissues. How prominent morphallactic regeneration is in [[oligochaetes]] is currently not well understood. Although relatively under-reported, it is possible that morphallaxis is a common mode of inter-segment regeneration in annelids. Following regeneration in ''L. variegatus'', past posterior segments sometimes become anterior in the new body orientation, consistent with morphallaxis.

Following amputation, most annelids are capable of sealing their body via rapid muscular contraction. Constriction of body muscle can lead to infection prevention. In certain species, such as ''[[Limnodrilus]]'', [[Autolysis (biology)|autolysis]] can be seen within hours after amputation in the [[ectoderm]] and [[mesoderm]]. Amputation is also thought to cause a large migration of cells to the injury site, and these form a wound plug.

===Echinoderms===

Tissue regeneration is widespread among echinoderms and has been well documented in [[starfish]] ''(Asteroidea)'', [[sea cucumber]]s ''(Holothuroidea)'', and [[sea urchin]]s ''(Echinoidea).'' Appendage regeneration in echinoderms has been studied since at least the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Candia Carnevali MD, Bonasoro F, Patruno M, Thorndyke MC | title = Cellular and molecular mechanisms of arm regeneration in crinoid echinoderms: the potential of arm explants | journal = Development Genes and Evolution | volume = 208 | issue = 8 | pages = 421–30 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9799422 | doi = 10.1007/s004270050199 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to appendages, some species can regenerate internal organs and parts of their central nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = San Miguel-Ruiz JE, Maldonado-Soto AR, García-Arrarás JE | title = Regeneration of the radial nerve cord in the sea cucumber Holothuria glaberrima | journal = BMC Developmental Biology | volume = 9 | pages = 3 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19126208 | pmc = 2640377 | doi = 10.1186/1471-213X-9-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to injury starfish can autotomize damaged appendages. Autotomy is the self-amputation of a body part, usually an appendage. &amp;nbsp;Depending on severity, starfish will then go through a four-week process where the appendage will be regenerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Patruno M, Thorndyke MC, Candia Carnevali MD, Bonasoro F, Beesley PW | title = Growth factors, heat-shock proteins and regeneration in echinoderms | journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 204 | issue = Pt 5 | pages = 843–8 | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11171408 | url = http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/5/843 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species must retain mouth cells in order to regenerate an appendage, due to the need for energy.&lt;ref name="Morgan_1900" /&gt;  The first organs to regenerate, in all species documented to date, are associated with the digestive tract.

===Planaria (Platyhelminthes)===

===Amphibians===
Limb regeneration in the [[axolotl]] and [[newt]] has been extensively studied and researched.

[[File:AxolotlBE.jpg|thumbnail|[[Axolotl]]s can regenerate a variety of structures, including their limbs]]

After amputation, the epidermis migrates to cover the stump in  1–2 hours, forming a structure called the wound epithelium (WE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Satoh A, Bryant SV, Gardiner DM | title = Nerve signaling regulates basal keratinocyte proliferation in the blastema apical epithelial cap in the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 366 | issue = 2 | pages = 374–81 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22537500 | doi = 10.1016/j.ydbio.2012.03.022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Epidermal cells continue to migrate over the WE, resulting in a thickened, specialized signaling center called the apical epithelial cap (AEC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Christensen RN, Tassava RA | title = Apical epithelial cap morphology and fibronectin gene expression in regenerating axolotl limbs | journal = Developmental Dynamics | volume = 217 | issue = 2 | pages = 216–24 | date = February 2000 | pmid = 10706145 | doi = 10.1002/(sici)1097-0177(200002)217:2&lt;216::aid-dvdy8&gt;3.0.co;2-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next several days there are changes in the underlying stump tissues that result in the formation of a [[blastema]] (a mass of dedifferentiated proliferating cells).

In spite of the historically few researchers studying limb regeneration, remarkable progress has been made recently in establishing the neotenous amphibian the axolotl (''Ambystoma mexicanum'') as a model genetic organism. This progress has been facilitated by advances in [[genomics]], [[bioinformatics]], and [[somatic cell]] [[transgenesis]] in other fields, that have created the opportunity to investigate the mechanisms of important biological properties, such as limb regeneration, in the axolotl.&lt;ref name="stepwise"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Endo T, Bryant SV, Gardiner DM | title = A stepwise model system for limb regeneration | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 270 | issue = 1 | pages = 135–45 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15136146 | doi = 10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.02.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ambystoma Genetic Stock Center (AGSC) is a self-sustaining, breeding colony of the axolotl supported by the [[National Science Foundation]] as a Living Stock Collection. Located at the University of Kentucky, the AGSC is dedicated to supplying genetically well-characterized axolotl embryos, larvae, and adults to laboratories throughout the United States and abroad. An [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]]-funded NCRR grant has led to the establishment of the Ambystoma EST database, the Salamander Genome Project (SGP) that has led to the creation of the first amphibian gene map and several annotated molecular data bases, and the creation of the research community web portal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Voss SR, Muzinic L, Zimmerman G | url = http://www.ambystoma.org | title = Sal-Site | work = Ambystoma.org | date = 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydra ===
[[Hydra (genus)|''Hydra'']] is a genus of freshwater [[polyp]] in the phylum [[Cnidaria]] with highly proliferative [[stem cells]] that gives them the ability to regenerate their entire body.&lt;ref name="Bosch_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bosch TC | title = Why polyps regenerate and we don't: towards a cellular and molecular framework for Hydra regeneration | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 303 | issue = 2 | pages = 421–33 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17234176 | doi = 10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.12.012 | publisher = Elsevier }}&lt;/ref&gt; Any fragment larger than a few hundred [[epithelial]] cells that is isolated from the body has the ability to regenerate into a smaller version of itself.&lt;ref name="Bosch_2007" /&gt; The high proportion of stem cells in the hydra supports its efficient regenerative ability.&lt;ref name="Wenger_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wenger Y, Buzgariu W, Reiter S, Galliot B | title = Injury-induced immune responses in Hydra | journal = Seminars in Immunology | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 277–94 | date = August 2014 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1016/j.smim.2014.06.004 | publisher = Elsevier }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regeneration among hydra occurs as foot regeneration arising from the basal part of the body, and head regeneration, arising from the apical region.&lt;ref name="Bosch_2007" /&gt; Regeneration tissues that are cut from the gastric region contain polarity, which allows them to distinguish between regenerating a head in the apical end and a foot in the basal end so that both regions are present in the newly regenerated organism.&lt;ref name="Bosch_2007" /&gt; Head regeneration requires complex reconstruction of the area, while foot regeneration is much simpler, similar to tissue repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buzgariu W, Crescenzi M, Galliot B | title = Robust G2 pausing of adult stem cells in Hydra | journal = Differentiation; Research in Biological Diversity | volume = 87 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 83–99 | date = 2014 | doi = 10.1016/j.diff.2014.03.001 | publisher = Elsevier | others = Science Direct }}&lt;/ref&gt; In both foot and head regeneration, however, there are two distinct [[biochemical cascade|molecular cascades]] that occur once the tissue is wounded: early injury response and a subsequent, signal-driven pathway of the regenerating tissue that leads to [[cellular differentiation]].&lt;ref name="Wenger_2014" /&gt; This early-injury response includes epithelial cell stretching for wound closure, the migration of interstitial progenitors towards the wound, [[cell death]], [[phagocytosis]] of cell debris, and reconstruction of the extracellular matrix.&lt;ref name="Wenger_2014" /&gt;

Regeneration in hydra has been defined as morphallaxis, the process where regeneration results from remodeling of existing material without cellular proliferation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Morgan TH | year = 1901 | title = Regeneration | volume = 7 | series = Columbia University Biological Series | publisher = The MacMillan Company | location = New York | url = https://archive.org/details/regeneration00morggoog }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Agata_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agata K, Saito Y, Nakajima E | title = Unifying principles of regeneration I: Epimorphosis versus morphallaxis | journal = Development, Growth &amp; Differentiation | volume = 49 | issue = 2 | pages = 73–8 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17335428 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-169X.2007.00919.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a hydra is cut into two pieces, the remaining severed sections form two fully functional and independent hydra, approximately the same size as the two smaller severed sections.&lt;ref name="Bosch_2007" /&gt; This occurs through the exchange and rearrangement of soft tissues without the formation of new material.&lt;ref name="Wenger_2014" /&gt;

===Aves (birds)===

Owing to a limited literature on the subject, birds are believed to have very limited regenerative abilities as adults. Some studies&lt;ref name="Vorontsova_1960"&gt;{{cite book | title = Asexual Reproduction and Regeneration | vauthors = Vorontsova MA, Liosner LD | veditors = Billet F | translator-first = PM | translator-last1 = Allen | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = Pergamon Press | year = 1960 | location = London | pages = 367–371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on roosters have suggested that birds can adequately regenerate some parts of the limbs and depending on the conditions in which regeneration takes place, such as age of the animal, the inter-relationship of the injured tissue with other muscles, and the type of operation, can involve complete regeneration of some musculoskeletal structure. Werber and Goldschmidt (1909) found that the goose and duck were capable of regenerating their beaks after partial amputation&lt;ref name="Vorontsova_1960" /&gt;  and Sidorova (1962) observed liver regeneration via hypertrophy in roosters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sidorova VF | title = Liver regeneration in birds | journal = Biulleten' Eksperimental'noi Biologii I Meditsiny | volume = 52 | issue = 6 | pages = 1426–9 | date = July 1962 | pmid = 14039265 | doi = 10.1007/BF00785312 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds are also capable of regenerating the hair cells in their cochlea following noise damage or ototoxic drug damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cotanche DA, Lee KH, Stone JS, Picard DA | title = Hair cell regeneration in the bird cochlea following noise damage or ototoxic drug damage | journal = Anatomy and Embryology | volume = 189 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–18 | date = January 1994 | pmid = 8192233 | doi = 10.1007/BF00193125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this evidence, contemporary studies suggest reparative regeneration in avian species is limited to periods during embryonic development.

Similar to the physiological regeneration of hair in mammals, birds can regenerate their feathers in order to repair damaged feathers or to attract mates with their plumage. Typically, seasonal changes that are associated with breeding seasons will prompt a hormonal signal for birds to begin regenerating feathers. This has been experimentally induced using thyroid hormones in the Rhode Island Red Fowls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hosker | first = Anne | name-list-format = vanc | title = Regeneration of Feathers after Thyroid Feeding | date = 1936 | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 13 | pages = 344–351 | url = http://jeb.biologists.org/content/13/3/344 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These species can regrow hair follicles, skin, [[sweat glands]], fur and cartilage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seifert AW, Kiama SG, Seifert MG, Goheen JR, Palmer TM, Maden M | title = Skin shedding and tissue regeneration in African spiny mice (Acomys) | journal = Nature | volume = 489 | issue = 7417 | pages = 561–5 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 23018966 | pmc = 3480082 | doi = 10.1038/nature11499 | bibcode = 2012Natur.489..561S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these two species, subsequent studies demonstrated that ''Acomys cahirinus'' could regenerate skin and excised tissue in the ear pinna.&lt;ref name="Gawriluk_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gawriluk TR, Simkin J, Thompson KL, Biswas SK, Clare-Salzler Z, Kimani JM, Kiama SG, Smith JJ, Ezenwa VO, Seifert AW | title = Comparative analysis of ear-hole closure identifies epimorphic regeneration as a discrete trait in mammals | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 7 | pages = 11164 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27109826 | pmc = 4848467 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms11164 | bibcode = 2016NatCo...711164G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Matias Santos D, Rita AM, Casanellas I, Brito Ova A, Araújo IM, Power D, Tiscornia G | title = Ear wound regeneration in the African spiny mouse Acomys cahirinus | journal = Regeneration | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 52–61 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 27499879 | pmc = 4857749 | doi = 10.1002/reg2.50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these examples, it is generally accepted that adult [[mammal]]s have limited regenerative capacity compared to most [[vertebrate]] embryos/larvae, adult salamanders and fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Kevin | last = Xu | name-list-format = vanc | title = Humans' Ability To Regenerate Damaged Organs Is At Our Fingertips | url = http://www.businessinsider.com/how-regeneration-works-2013-7 | work = Business Insider | date = July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But the regeneration therapy approach of [[Robert O.

Some researchers have also claimed that the [[Murphy Roths Large|MRL mouse]] strain exhibits enhanced regenerative abilities. Work comparing the differential [[gene expression]] of scarless healing MRL mice and a poorly-healing [[C57BL/6]] mouse strain, identified 36 [[gene]]s differentiating the healing process between MRL mice and other mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Masinde G, Li X, Baylink DJ, Nguyen B, Mohan S | title = Isolation of wound healing/regeneration genes using restrictive fragment differential display-PCR in MRL/MPJ and C57BL/6 mice | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 330 | issue = 1 | pages = 117–22 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15781240 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.02.143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayashi ML, Rao BS, Seo JS, Choi HS, Dolan BM, Choi SY, Chattarji S, Tonegawa S | title = Inhibition of p21-activated kinase rescues symptoms of fragile X syndrome in mice | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = 27 | pages = 11489–94 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17592139 | pmc = 1899186 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0705003104 | bibcode = 2007PNAS..10411489H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Study of the regenerative process in these animals is aimed at discovering how to duplicate them in humans, such as deactivation of the p21 gene.&lt;ref name="Heber-Katz_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bedelbaeva K, Snyder A, Gourevitch D, Clark L, Zhang XM, Leferovich J, Cheverud JM, Lieberman P, Heber-Katz E | title = Lack of p21 expression links cell cycle control and appendage regeneration in mice | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 13 | pages = 5845–50 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20231440 | pmc = 2851923 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1000830107 | laysummary = http://www.physorg.com/news187879295.html | laysource = PhysOrg.com | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.5845B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2010-03/humans-could-regenerate-tissue-newts-switchin-single-gene Humans Could Regenerate Tissue Like Newts By Switching Off a Single Gene]&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent work has shown that MRL mice actually close small ear holes with scar tissue, rather than regeneration as originally claimed.&lt;ref name="Gawriluk_2016" /&gt;

MRL mice are not protected against [[myocardial infarction]]; heart regeneration in adult mammals ([[neocardiogenesis]]) is limited, because heart muscle cells are nearly all [[G0 phase|terminally differentiated]].

{{main|Regeneration in humans}}

The regrowth of lost tissues or organs in the human body is being researched. Some tissues such as skin regrow quite readily; others have been thought to have little or no capacity for regeneration, but ongoing research suggests that there is some hope for a variety of tissues and organs.&lt;ref name="Birbrair 2298–2314"/&gt;&lt;ref name=CompleteRegen2&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Min | first1 = Su | last2 = Wang | first2 = Song W. | last3 = Orr | first3 = William | name-list-format = vanc | title = Graphic general pathology: 2.2 complete regeneration: | work = Pathology | publisher = pathol.med.stu.edu.cn | year = 2006 | quote = After the repair process has been completed, the structure and function of the injured tissue are completely normal. This type of regeneration is common in physiological situations. Examples of physiological regeneration are the continual replacement of cells of the skin and repair of the endometrium after menstruation. Complete regeneration can occur in pathological situations in tissues that have good regenerative capacity. | url = http://pathol.med.stu.edu.cn/pathol/listEngContent2.aspx?ContentID=492 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121207231322/http://pathol.med.stu.edu.cn/pathol/listEngContent2.aspx?ContentID=492 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-12-07 | access-date = 2013-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human organs that have been regenerated include the bladder, vagina and the penis.&lt;ref name=regen2014104&gt;{{cite web | last =Mohammadi | first = Dara | name-list-format = vanc | title = Bioengineered organs: The story so far… | work = The Guardian | date = 4 October 2014 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/oct/04/penis-transplants-anthony-atala-interview | access-date = 9 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As are all metazoans, humans are capable of physiological regeneration (i.e. the replacement of cells during homeostatic maintenance that does not necessitate injury). For example, the regeneration of red blood cells via erythropoiesis occurs through the maturation of erythrocytes from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, their subsequent circulation for around 90 days in the blood stream, and their eventual cell-death in the spleen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Principles of Regenerative Biology | vauthors = Carlson BM | publisher = Academic Press | year = 2007 | pages = 25–26 | isbn = 978-0-12-369439-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of physiological regeneration is the sloughing and rebuilding of a functional endometrium during each menstrual cycle in females in response to varying levels of circulating estrogen and progesterone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferenczy A, Bertrand G, Gelfand MM | title = Proliferation kinetics of human endometrium during the normal menstrual cycle | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 133 | issue = 8 | pages = 859–67 | date = April 1979 | pmid = 434029 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9378(79)90302-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, humans are limited in their capacity for reparative regeneration, which occurs in response to injury. One of the most studied regenerative responses in humans is the hypertrophy of the liver following liver injury.&lt;ref name="Michalopoulos_1997"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Michalopoulos GK, DeFrances MC | title = Liver regeneration | journal = Science | volume = 276 | issue = 5309 | pages = 60–6 | date = April 1997 | pmid = 9082986 | doi = 10.1126/science.276.5309.60 | pmc = 2701258 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taub_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taub R | title = Liver regeneration: from myth to mechanism | journal = Nature Reviews. Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = 836–47 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15459664 | doi = 10.1038/nrm1489 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the original mass of the liver is re-established in direct proportion to the amount of liver removed following partial hepatectomy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kawasaki S, Makuuchi M, Ishizone S, Matsunami H, Terada M, Kawarazaki H | title = Liver regeneration in recipients and donors after transplantation | journal = Lancet | volume = 339 | issue = 8793 | pages = 580–1 | date = March 1992 | pmid = 1347095 | doi = 10.1016/0140-6736(92)90867-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which indicates that signals from the body regulate liver mass precisely, both positively and negatively, until the desired mass is reached. This response is considered cellular regeneration (a form of compensatory hypertrophy) where the function and mass of the liver is regenerated through the proliferation of existing mature hepatic cells (mainly hepatocytes), but the exact morphology of the liver is not regained.&lt;ref name="Taub_2004" /&gt; This process is driven by growth factor and cytokine regulated pathways.&lt;ref name="Michalopoulos_1997" /&gt; The normal sequence of inflammation and regeneration does not function accurately in cancer. Specifically, cytokine stimulation of cells leads to expression of genes that change cellular functions and suppress the immune response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vlahopoulos SA | title = Aberrant control of NF-κB in cancer permits transcriptional and phenotypic plasticity, to curtail dependence on host tissue: molecular mode | journal = Cancer Biology &amp; Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 254–270 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28884042 | pmc = 5570602 | doi = 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2017.0029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adult neurogenesis is also a form of cellular regeneration. For example, hippocampal neuron renewal occurs in normal adult humans at an annual turnover rate of 1.75% of neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spalding KL, Bergmann O, Alkass K, Bernard S, Salehpour M, Huttner HB, Boström E, Westerlund I, Vial C, Buchholz BA, Possnert G, Mash DC, Druid H, Frisén J | title = Dynamics of hippocampal neurogenesis in adult humans | journal = Cell | volume = 153 | issue = 6 | pages = 1219–1227 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23746839 | pmc = 4394608 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.05.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiac myocyte renewal has been found to occur in normal adult humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bergmann O, Bhardwaj RD, Bernard S, Zdunek S, Barnabé-Heider F, Walsh S, Zupicich J, Alkass K, Buchholz BA, Druid H, Jovinge S, Frisén J | title = Evidence for cardiomyocyte renewal in humans | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = 5923 | pages = 98–102 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19342590 | pmc = 2991140 | doi = 10.1126/science.1164680 | bibcode = 2009Sci...324...98B }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at a higher rate in adults following acute heart injury such as infarction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beltrami AP, Urbanek K, Kajstura J, Yan SM, Finato N, Bussani R, Nadal-Ginard B, Silvestri F, Leri A, Beltrami CA, Anversa P | title = Evidence that human cardiac myocytes divide after myocardial infarction | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 344 | issue = 23 | pages = 1750–7 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11396441 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200106073442303 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in adult myocardium following infarction, proliferation is only found in around 1% of myocytes around the area of injury, which is not enough to restore function of cardiac muscle. However, this may be an important target for regenerative medicine as it implies that regeneration of cardiomyocytes, and consequently of myocardium, can be induced.

Another example of reparative regeneration in humans is fingertip regeneration, which occurs after phalange amputation distal to the nail bed (especially in children)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McKim LH | title = REGENERATION OF THE DISTAL PHALANX | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = 549–50 | date = May 1932 | pmid = 20318716 | pmc = 402335 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muneoka K, Allan CH, Yang X, Lee J, Han M | title = Mammalian regeneration and regenerative medicine | journal = Birth Defects Research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="980">'''Retrospective [[think aloud protocol]]''' is a technique used in [[usability]], and [[eye tracking]] in particular, to gather qualitative information on the user intents and reasoning during a test. It's a form of [[think aloud protocol]] performed ''after'' the user testing session activities, instead of during them.
Fairly often the retrospective protocol is stimulated by using a visual reminder such as a video replay. In writing studies, the visual reminder may be the writing produced during the think-aloud session.

'''''Scientology''''' is a compilation book about the [[Church of Scientology]] and the [[new religious movement]] [[Scientology]], edited by [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]]. It was published in March 2009 by [[Oxford University Press]]. In addition to Lewis, other contributors to the book include [[J. Gordon Melton]], [[William Sims Bainbridge]], [[Douglas E. Cowan]], [[David G. Bromley]], [[Anson Shupe]], [[James T. Richardson]], and [[Susan J. Palmer]]. ''Scientology'' gives an overview and introduction to the organization, and presents an analysis of the movement from the perspective of [[sociology]]. The book compares the organization to other religious movements, and goes over its history of controversy. It delves into the practices of the organization and activities of its missions.

''Scientology'' was given an unfavorable review in the ''International Journal of Cultic Studies'', which considered the book unduly biased in Scientology's favour, a view echoed in a review in satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]''.&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt; It received a positive review in ''Alternative Spirituality and Religion Review'', describing it as "the most sophisticated academic item published on Scientology" to date, a book to be read by journalists and academics alike, and "the most important collection of scholarly articles on Scientology published so far – in any language".&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt;

==Editor==
At the time of the book's publication, James R. Lewis was employed as a lecturer in the subject of [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Oxford University Press | title =  Scientology - About the Author| work =  OUP USA  | publisher = www.oup.com | year =  2009| url = http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/ReligionTheology/SociologyofReligion/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195331493 | accessdate =2010-01-29  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second part covers "Theoretical and Quantitative Approaches", examining Scientology's [[soteriology]] as well as the degree to which Scientology can be said to be growing. The third part focuses on the "Community and Practices" of Scientology, while the fourth part, "Sources and Comparative Approaches", examines Scientology's religious claims. Part V is focused on "Controversy", such as Scientology's battles with the [[anti-cult movement]] and court cases in different countries concerning Scientology's recognition or lack of recognition as a religion. The sixth part analyzes the organization's activities in its "International Missions", while the seventh examines "Dimensions of Scientology", including a chapter on the [[Xenu]] myth.

Various chapters comment on Scientology's growth. Lewis puts forth the assertion that the religion is growing at a "healthy—but not a spectacular—rate" (22 percent over the period from 1990 to 2001, from 45,000 to 55,000 according to an American survey of religious self-identification), and states that contrary to the Church's own claims, it is "clearly not the world's fastest growing".&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt;&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; William Sims Bainbridge, a [[sociologist]], asserts that Scientology has experienced growth along the [[West Coast of the United States]].&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; Bainbridge looked at statistical data on the percentage of websites managed by Scientologists, and his studies revealed that the most significant portion was in the [[Pacific Northwest]] and the state of [[California]].&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; According to Bainbridge, the experience of Scientology founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] in [[science fiction]] writing combined with the Church of Scientology's skill with the "emerging cyberculture" might lead to ways that the organization can change in a future that further utilizes technology.&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; In a section of the book on dealings of the organization in [[Denmark]], researchers found that there was a decrease in the number of people joining the organization, and that the number of dedicated Scientologists in the country remained steady for the past two decades.&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; [[University of Copenhagen]] researchers Rie Wallendorf and Peter B. Andersen write that the Church of Scientology in Denmark is wary of those external to the organization, and that this detracts from the likelihood that new members will join.&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt;

[[Charles de Gaulle University – Lille III|Charles De Gaulle University]] researcher [[Régis Dericquebourg]] writes that when compared to the Scientology practice of "[[Auditing (Scientology)|Auditing]]", other ceremonies carried out by the organization have more restricted levels of participation.&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; According to Dericquebourg, these Scientology ceremonies include social functions which are frequented mainly by "elite members".&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; [[University Bordeaux Montaigne|University Michel de Montaigne]] researcher Bernardette Rigal-Cellard investigated the various Scientology missions and determined that these missions operated with a United States-based type of methodology.&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; This form of organizational structure and operational tactics is seen as not working well in areas where the U.S. is not seen favorably, including sections of [[Western Europe]], but agreeable to locations sympathetic to American culture.&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt;

==Critical reception==

===Reviews in scholarly journals===

====Review by Terra Manca====
''Scientology'' was given a negative review by Terra Manca writing in the ''International Journal of Cultic Studies'', the journal of the [[International Cultic Studies Association]].&lt;ref name="manca"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Manca|first=Terra|title=Book Review: Scientology by James R. Lewis (editor)|journal=International Journal of Cultic Studies|date=November 1, 2010|url=http://www.icsahome.com/articles/book-review-scientology-ijcs-2010|accessdate=2010-11-17|volume=1|issue=1|publisher=[[International Cultic Studies Association]]|pages=90–96|oclc=608305709|location=[[Bonita Springs, Florida]]|issn=2154-7270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manca wrote, "it is most likely to please persons who take an uncritical view of Scientology."&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; Of the lack of standards of research utilized in the book, the review stated, "far too many contributors in this volume fail to critically assess the data that they gather, thereby falling short of providing evidence that has undergone rigorous academic inquiry. Without rigor or critical assessment, a book such as this one (about a supposed new religious movement [NRM]) risks becoming pro-NRM propaganda."&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; Manca's review put forth the argument, "although this book brings needed academic attention to Scientology, its shortfalls are substantial enough to render it as an unreliable source of information about the organization."&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt;

{{quote box |width=25em | bgcolor=#c6dbf7 |align=right |halig=left | salign=right|quote="... although this book brings needed academic attention to Scientology, its shortfalls are substantial enough to render it as an unreliable source of information about the organization."|source=&amp;nbsp;—''International Journal of Cultic Studies''&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt;}}
Manca criticized the book for failing to include substantive analysis of several aspects within the controversial history of the Scientology organization, including its treatment in countries Germany and [[Belgium]]; lack of discussion regarding Scientology programs including [[Narconon]], [[Criminon]], [[World Literacy Crusade]], and [[Applied Scholastics]]; dearth of coverage regarding use within the organization of the [[Suppressive Person]] [[jargon]] and related practice of [[Disconnection]]; scarcity of commentary on the successor to the organization's [[intelligence agency]] [[Guardian's Office]] with the [[Office of Special Affairs]], and failure to cite critical scholarship on the subject matter.&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; Manca noted that aside from simply neglecting to utilize key academic scholarship on the topic, the authors of chapters within ''Scientology'' also failed to seriously analyze material received from primary-sources including Scientology organization representatives.&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; The review asserted, "This lack of critical inquiry leads to some conclusions that appear biased, involves the use of polarized language, and significantly diminishes the quality of information that might have challenged Scientology's claims regarding itself and its founder."&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; The review criticized ''Scientology'' for the fact that two contributors had added a reference to [[Wikipedia]] to their essays – "citing questionable sources can produce questionable results, which in turn can discredit the value of academic research".&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; Manca questioned the judgement of the book's publisher for allowing this type of writing practice, "It is surprising that editors at Oxford University Press allow Wikipedia to stand as an appropriate scholarly source in this or any volume."&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt;

The ''International Journal of Cultic Studies'' book review observed that the researchers were not removed in expressed point-of-view from the topic they wrote about, "Despite Lewis's claims, he and many of his contributors fail to remain neutral".&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; Manca did not recommend the book for research on the Scientology organization, "Because of its numerous and varied shortcomings, this new book on Scientology is a poor sourcebook on the organization."&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; Manca wrote that due to the poor quality of the work, the book itself could be cited as an example of problematic research, "Oddly enough, because of its numerous shortfalls and biases, ''Scientology'' may be useful to anyone who is studying the pro-cult/counter-cult debate and who wants to see numerous examples of biased scholarship by apparently polarized researchers."&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; The review concluded, "As a reference for inquiry into Scientology, however, this book fails on many fronts."&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt;

====Review by Marco Frenschkowski====
{{quote box |width=25em | bgcolor=#c6dbf7 |align=right |halig=left | salign=right|quote="... the most sophisticated academic item published on Scientology so far [...] a serious attempt at bringing together what different fields of cultural studies (not just religious studies) can say about the most controversial of NRMs."|source=&amp;nbsp;—''Alternative Spirituality and Religion Review''&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt;}}
A 30-page review by the German [[Protestant]] [[theologian]] and [[history of religion]] scholar Marco Frenschkowski in ''Alternative Spirituality and Religion Review'' stated that the book "simply put is the most
sophisticated academic item published on Scientology so far", adding that "this does not mean it will not be controversial, or that every statement in the book holds up to scrutiny."&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski&gt;{{Cite journal

Frenschkowski lauded Lewis's introduction, in which Lewis notes scholars' reluctance to publish Scientology research, given the organization's reputation as "a litigious organization, ready to sue anyone who dares criticize the Church", and addresses Scientologists' tendency to misunderstand the nature of the academic process.&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt; Frenschkowski described Melton's chapter as finding "a fine balance between critical observations and giving due weight to the point of view of devoted Scientologists [...] This does not mean defending Scientology: it means taking both members and critics seriously."&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt;

Frenschkowski welcomed Rothstein's chapter on the [[Xenu]] myth as an "important study", stating that it "defines a very good starting point for further research".&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt; He commented that Rothstein was right to praise "the anonymous Wikipedia article on the subject", a fact that was reflective of "the deeply unsatisfying state of affairs" that to date there had been not a single peer-reviewed journal article covering the topic.&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt; However, he wished Rothstein had contextualized the myth more with Hubbard's other [[space opera]] writings, and the [[science fiction]] field in general, and suggested more work needed to be done on this.&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt;

Frenschkowski listed some minor errors in the anthology, said he regretted the absence of a glossary, and was critical of the fact that there were several overlaps between various chapters; however, his main point of criticism was that apart from some new data based on the quantitative sociological approach, the book mainly presented overviews of data already known, stating that "this does not diminish the value of this fine collection, but the next academic publications on Scientology should not be once again overviews but monographs on special questions", "more specialized, in-depth studies on concepts, ideas and practices working with new data".&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt;

Towards the end of his review, Frenschkowski recalls the editor's prediction, made in the introduction, that the book would "likely end up pleasing no one engaged in the Scientology/anti-Scientology conflict, which is perhaps as it should be".&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt; Summing up, Frenschkowski states that the book pleased him, at any rate, and that he wished for it to be "read not just by academics but also e.g. by journalists [...]. It is the most important collection of articles on Scientology published so far – in any language."&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt;

===Other reviews===
The book received a critical analysis in the British [[satire|satirical]] and current affairs [[magazine]] ''[[Private Eye]]''.&lt;ref name="hislop"&gt;{{cite journal|editor-last=Hislop|editor-first=Ian|title=Literary Review: Cult cock - OUP|journal=[[Private Eye]]|volume=|issue=|page=16|publisher= Pressdram Ltd|location = | date = April 17, 2009| url = | doi = |issn=0032-888X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The review criticized the book for its unusually sympathetic tone and for not mentioning numerous notable controversies surrounding Scientology.&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt; ''Private Eye'' was critical of the book's presentation of asserted facts regarding the life of Scientology founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]], as given in two separate instances in the book by contributors [[J. Gordon Melton]] and [[David G. Bromley]].&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt; Melton stated his contribution gave, "an overview of the life of L. Ron Hubbard anchored by the general agreed facts",&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt; and Bromley asserted, "Although the basic outline of L. Ron Hubbard's life is not contested, the LRH persona has been a subject of particularly intense debate. Church critics have charged that many of the claims that Hubbard made about his own life and accomplishments are empirically false."&lt;ref name="lewis" /&gt; The ''Private Eye'' review called this notion "poppycock", writing, "Everything about Scientology's founder is contested, though no one reading this book would realise that."&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt; As an example of disputed material about Hubbard's life, the review contrasted assertions by Melton about the [[military career of L. Ron Hubbard]] with documented [[United States Navy]] records cited by author [[Russell Miller]] in the [[biography]], ''[[Bare-Faced Messiah]]''.&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt;

The ''Private Eye'' review concluded by criticizing [[Oxford University Press]] for publishing the book: "What is utterly mystifying is why one of the oldest and most respected publishing houses in the world chooses to give its imprimatur to this tendentious drivel."&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt; When questioned by ''Private Eye'', a spokesman for Oxford University Press responded, "Certainly this book was peer-reviewed."&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt; ''Private Eye'' joked that the [[peer review]]ers of the book may have been controversial figures [[Jeffrey Archer|Lord Archer]] and [[Conrad Black|Lord Black]].&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt;

Richard Cimino, founder and editor of the Religioscope Institute-published newsletter ''Religion Watch'', wrote that the book "focuses less on the church's abuses than on its organizational dynamics and teachings, although its authors do broach controversial issues."&lt;ref name="cimino"&gt;{{cite news| last =Cimino  | first =  Richard | title =Analysis: the rise or the fall of Scientology?  | work =Religioscope | publisher = religion.info | date = July 30, 2009 | url = http://religion.info/english/articles/article_433.shtml | accessdate = 2010-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cimino commented that the book is "divided about whether the movement and its distinctive blend of science, psychotherapy and esoteric religion is growing".&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; In an article about Scientology by B.A. Robinson at the website of the organization [[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]], ''Scientology'' is listed as a "recommended book".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Robinson | first = B.A. | title = About the Church of Scientology - A religion founded by L.

'''Simulation governance''' is a managerial function concerned with assurance of reliability of information generated by [[numerical simulation]].  The term was introduced in 2011 &lt;ref&gt;Szabó B. and Actis R. Simulation governance: New technical requirements for software tools in computational solid mechanics International Workshop on Verification and Validation in Computational Science University of Notre Dame 17–19 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and specific technical requirements were addressed from the perspective of mechanical design in 2012 &lt;ref&gt;Szabó B. and Actis R. Simulation governance: Technical requirements for mechanical design. Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 249–252 158–168, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Its strategic importance was addressed in 2015 &lt;ref&gt;Meintjes K.  [https://www.nafems.org/publications/resource_center/bm_jan_15_1/ Simulation Governance: Managing Simulation as a Strategic Capability]. NAFEMS Benchmark Magazine, January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Imbert J-F.  [https://www.nafems.org/publications/resource_center/nwc15_100/ Simulation Governance - Building confidence, a key dimension of simulation strategy]. NAFEMS World Congress NWC15 San Diego, June 2015. &lt;/ref&gt;.  At the [https://www.nafems.org/congress/ 2017 NAFEMS World Congress] in Stockholm simulation governance was identified as the first of eight “[https://www.nafems.org/congress/thebigissues/ big issues]” in [[numerical simulation]].

Simulation governance is concerned with (a) selection and adoption of the best available simulation technology, (b) formulation of [[mathematical models]], (c) management of experimental data, (d) data and solution [[Verification and validation of computer simulation models#Verification|verification]] procedures, and (e) revision of mathematical models in the light of new information collected from physical experiments and field observations &lt;ref&gt;Oberkampf WL and Pilch M. [https://www.nafems.org/publications/resource_center/r0121/ Simulation Verification and Validation for Managers]. NAFEMS, 2017. {{ISBN|978-1-910643-33-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

A plan for simulation governance has to be tailored to fit the mission of each organization or department within an organization: If that mission is to apply established rules of design and [[certification]] then emphasis is on solution verification and [[standardization]]. If, on the other hand, that mission is to formulate design rules, or make condition-based maintenance decisions, then [[Verification and validation of computer simulation models|verification, validation]] and [[uncertainty quantification]] must be part of the plan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="842">'''Sub-caliber training''' is used to save wear and expense when training with a larger gun by use of smaller weapons with identical ballistic characteristics. The smaller weapons could be inserted into the larger weapon's barrel, externally attached to the barrel or mounted above the weapon. Examples include the [[M303 Sub-Caliber insert]] for the {{convert|120|mm|1|abbr=on}} [[M120 mortar]] that allows the mortar to use {{convert|81|mm|1|abbr=on}} ammunition or the M49A1 sub-caliber device, which used [[7.62×51mm NATO]] rifle rounds in the {{convert|90|mm|1|abbr=on}} [[M67 recoilless rifle]]. These devices/weapons have been used for guns as large as the {{convert|12|-|16|in|1|adj=on|sp=us}} main guns of [[battleship]]s.

'''Sumptuary laws''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''sumptuāriae lēgēs'') are [[law]]s that attempt to regulate consumption; ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' defines them as "Laws made for the purpose of restraining luxury or extravagance, particularly against inordinate expenditures in the matter of apparel, food, furniture, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, p. 1436 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, they were laws that were intended to regulate and reinforce [[social hierarchy|social hierarchies]] and [[morality|morals]] through restrictions, often depending upon a person's social rank, on their permitted clothing, food, and luxury expenditures.

Societies have used sumptuary laws for a variety of purposes.  They were used as an attempt to regulate the balance of trade by limiting the market for expensive imported goods. They made it easy to identify [[Ranks of nobility and peerage|social rank]] and [[Privilege (social inequality)|privilege]], and as such could be used for [[social discrimination]].&lt;ref name="Ribeiro"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ribeiro |first=Aileen |title=Dress and Morality |publisher=Berg Publishers |year=2003 |pages=12–16 |isbn=978-1-85973-782-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The laws frequently prevented [[commoner]]s from imitating the appearance of aristocrats and also could be used to [[social stigma|stigmatize]] disfavored groups. In the [[Late Middle Ages]], sumptuary laws in [[medieval commune|medieval cities]] were instituted as a way for the [[nobility]] to cap or limit the [[conspicuous consumption]] of the prosperous [[bourgeoisie]].  If bourgeois subjects appeared to be as wealthy or wealthier than the ruling nobility, it could undermine the nobility's presentation of themselves as powerful, legitimate rulers. This could call into question their ability to control and defend their [[fief]], and inspire potential traitors and rebels. Such laws continued to be used for these purposes well into the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Ribeiro" /&gt;

==Classical world==

===Ancient Greece ===
The first written Greek law code (Locrian code), by [[Zaleucus]] in the 7th century BC, stipulated that: 
{{quote|A free-born woman may not be accompanied by more than one female slave, unless she is drunk; she may not leave the city during the night, unless she is planning to commit adultery; she may not wear gold jewelry or a garment with a purple border, unless she is a courtesan; and a husband may not wear a gold-studded ring or a cloak of Milesian fashion unless he is bent upon prostitution or adultery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0060.tlg001.perseus-grc3:12.21.1 "Diodorus Siculus, Library 12.21", Demosthenes Against Timocrates 139–43]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It also banned the drinking of undiluted [[wine]] except for medical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/YAK_ZYM/ZALEUCUS.html Zaleucus – Britannica 1911 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Rome===
The ''Sumptuariae Leges'' of [[ancient Rome]] were various laws passed to prevent inordinate expense (Latin ''sūmptus'') in banquets and dress, such as the use of expensive [[Tyrian purple]] dye.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000117024929/http://www.unc.edu/courses/rometech/public/content/survival/Alison_Austin/dyeing.html Dyeing in the ancient world – Austin, Alison, University of North Carolina]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/268/2/3.html In Support of the Oppian Law by Cato the Censor.

The World's Famous Orations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]], men were forbidden to wear [[silk]].

It was considered the duty of government to put a check upon extravagance in personal expenditure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Smith | first = William | authorlink = William Smith (lexicographer) |author2=William Wayte |author3=G. E. Marindin  | encyclopedia= A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities | title = Census | url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0063&amp;query=head%3D%231015 | accessdate = 2006-05-25 | edition = third | year = 1890 | publisher = Albemarle Street | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and such restrictions are found in laws attributed to the [[Roman Kingdom|kings of Rome]] and in the [[Twelve Tables]]. The [[Roman censor]]s, who were entrusted with the ''disciplina'' or ''cura morum'', published the ''nota censoria''. In it were listed the names of everyone found guilty of a luxurious mode of living; a great many instances of this kind are recorded. As the [[Roman Republic]] wore on, further such laws were passed; however, towards the end of the Republic, they were virtually repealed. Any such laws which may have still existed were ignored during the period of profligate [[Luxury good|luxury]] characterizing the height of the Roman Empire, except the laws regarding the wearing of Tyrian purple.&lt;ref name="CodexTheodosianus"&gt;Codex Theodosianus 14.10.2–3, tr. C. Pharr, "The Theodosian Code", p. 415&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the [[Roman Emperor]] could wear the symbol of his office, a Tyrian purple cape trimmed in [[Gold (color)|golden]] thread, and [[Roman senator]]s were the only ones who could wear the badge of their office, a Tyrian purple stripe on their toga. During the height of the Empire, expenditure on silk imported from [[China|Sinica]] was so high that Imperial advisers warned that Roman [[silver]] reserves were becoming exhausted.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==Asia==

===China===
Sumptuary laws existed in China in one form or another from the [[Qin dynasty]] onwards (221&amp;nbsp;BC).  The [[Confucian]] virtue of restraint was embodied in the scholarly system central to China's bureaucracy and became encoded in its laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Spence | first = Jonathan D. | title = The Search for Modern China | publisher = [[W.W.Norton]] | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-393-30780-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some laws concerned the size and decoration of graves and mausoleums. The founder of the [[Ming dynasty]], the [[Hongwu Emperor]], issued such regulations in the first year of his rule (1368) and tightened them in 1396, allowing only the highest nobility and officials of the top three ranks a  memorial [[stele]] installed on top of a [[bixi (tortoise)|stone tortoise]]; the steles of lower-level [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarins]] were perched on rectangular pedestals, while commoners had to be satisfied with a simple gravestone. The location of graves, and the number of attendant statues depended on rank.&lt;ref name=deGroot2&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=Brill Archive |year=1892|first=Jan Jakob Maria |last=de Groot|title=The Religious System of China|volume=II
|url=https://archive.org/stream/religioussystem01groogoog#page/n105/mode/1up |pages=451–452 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After circa 1550, sumptuary law in China was reformed. It had long been ineffective.&lt;ref name="Pomeranz 2002 425"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pomeranz | first = Kenneth | title = Political economy and ecology on the eve of industrialisation: Europe, China and the global conjuncture | journal = American Historical Review | volume = 107 | issue = 2 | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1086/532293 | pages = 425}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consumption of luxuries had risen over the previous several centuries, and at the time of the European [[Industrial revolution]], Chinese consumption of luxuries such as tea, sugar, fine silk, tobacco and eating utensils was on a par with [[Core-periphery|core regions]] in Europe.&lt;ref name="Pomeranz 2002 425"/&gt;

===Japan under the shōguns===
According to ''Britannica Online'', "In feudal Japan sumptuary laws were passed with a frequency and minuteness of scope that had no parallel in the history of the Western world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9070320 Online Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Tokugawa period]] (1603–1868) in Japan, people of every class were subject to strict sumptuary laws that included regulation of the types of clothing that could be worn. In the second half of that period (the 18th and 19th centuries), the merchant class (''[[chōnin]]'') had grown far wealthier than the aristocratic [[samurai]], and these laws sought to maintain the superiority of the samurai class despite the ability of the merchants to wear far more luxurious clothing and to own far more luxurious items. The [[shogunate]] eventually gave in and allowed certain concessions, including allowing merchants of a certain prestige to wear a single sword at their belt; samurai were required to wear a [[daisho|matched pair]] when on official duty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vh_rAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=daisho+edict&amp;dq=daisho+edict&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T9nATfyrKobk0QGDs6C4Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAjgK ''Cutting Edge: Japanese Swords in the British Museum'', Victor Harris, Tuttle Pub., 2005 p.26]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic world==

Islamic sumptuary laws are based upon teachings found in the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]]. Males are exhorted not to wear silk clothes, nor have jewelry made of gold. Likewise, wearing clothes or robes that drag on the ground, seen as a sign of vanity and excessive pride, are also forbidden. These rules do not apply to women, who are allowed all this.

Prohibition of depictions of human and animal figures in general are similar to those of the Quranic prohibition on [[you shall not make for yourself an idol|graven images]]. Hadiths do allow the depiction of animals on clothing items.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Xinru. Silk and Religion: An Exploration of Material Life and the Thought of People, p.137, 1998, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-564452-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval and Renaissance Europe==

Sumptuary laws issued by secular authorities aimed at keeping the main population dressed according to their "station" do not begin until the later 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Piponnier and Perrine Mane; ''Dress in the Middle Ages''; pp. 114–41; Yale UP, 1997; {{ISBN|0-300-06906-5}}; M.G. Muzzarelli, ''Guardaroba medievale: Vesti e società dal XIII al XVI secolo'' (Bologna 1999) pp 268-85, 306-49.&lt;/ref&gt; These laws were addressed to the entire social body, but the brunt of regulation was directed at women and the middle classes. Their curbing of display was ordinarily couched in religious and moralizing vocabulary, yet was affected by social and economic considerations aimed at preventing ruinous expenses among the wealthy classes and the drain of capital reserves to foreign suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;Summarized very succinctly in  David Jacoby, "Silk Economics and Cross-Cultural Artistic Interaction: Byzantium, the Muslim World, and the Christian West" ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'' '''58''' (2004: pp. 197-240) p. 206, with references.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Courtesans===
Special forms of dress for [[prostitute]]s and [[courtesan]]s were introduced in the 13th century: in [[Marseilles]] a striped cloak, in England a striped hood, and so on.  Over time, these tended to be reduced to distinctive bands of fabric attached to the arm or shoulder, or tassels on the arm.  Later restrictions specified various forms of finery that were forbidden, although there was also sometimes a recognition that finery represented working equipment (and capital) for a prostitute, and they could be exempted from laws applying to other non-noble women.  By the 15th century, no compulsory clothing seems to have been imposed on prostitutes in [[Florence]], [[Venice]] (the European capital of courtesans) or [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Piponnier and Mane:139–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

===England===
In England, which in this respect was typical of Europe, from the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] in the [[Medieval England|Middle Ages]] until well into the 17th century,&lt;ref name="Ribeiro" /&gt; sumptuary laws dictated what colour and type of clothing, furs, fabrics, and trims were allowed to persons of various ranks or incomes.  In the case of clothing, this was intended, amongst other reasons, to reduce spending on foreign textiles and to ensure that people did not dress "above their station":

{{quote|The excess of apparel and the superfluity of unnecessary foreign wares thereto belonging now of late years is grown by sufferance to such an extremity that the manifest decay of the whole realm generally is like to follow (by bringing into the realm such superfluities of silks, [[cloth of gold|cloths of gold]], silver, and other most vain devices of so great cost for the quantity thereof as of necessity the moneys and treasure of the realm is and must be yearly conveyed out of the same to answer the said excess) but also particularly the wasting and undoing of a great number of young gentlemen, otherwise serviceable, and others seeking by show of apparel to be esteemed as gentlemen, who, allured by the vain show of those things, do not only consume themselves, their goods, and lands which their parents left unto them, but also run into such debts and shifts as they cannot live out of danger of laws without attempting unlawful acts, whereby they are not any ways serviceable to their country as otherwise they might be|Statute issued at Greenwich, 15 June 1574, by order of [[Elizabeth I]]&lt;ref&gt;Statute issued at Greenwich, 15 June 1574, 16 Elizabeth I, [http://elizabethan.org/sumptuary/  transcribed with modernized spelling], retrieved 6 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A 1571 Act of Parliament to stimulate domestic wool consumption and general trade decreed that on Sundays and holidays all males over six years of age, except for the nobility and persons of degree, were to wear woollen caps on pain of a fine of three farthings (¾ penny) per day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?num=555&amp;u=1&amp;seq=438&amp;view=image&amp;size=100&amp;id=pst.000017915519 13 Eliz. c.19] ''An Acte for the making of Cappes''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/statute_cap|title=statute cap – definition of statute cap in English|work=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]]|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law instituted the [[flat cap]] as part of English wear. The 1571 act was repealed in 1597.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000017915502;view=1up;seq=165 39 Eliz. c.18] ''An Acte for the reviving continuance explanacion perfecting and repealing of divers Statutes''&lt;/ref&gt;

An extremely long list of items, specifying colour, materials, and sometimes place of manufacture (imported goods being much more tightly restricted) followed for each sex, with equally specific exceptions by rank of nobility or position held. For the most part, these laws seem to have had little effect, though the [[Parliament of England]] made repeated amendments to the laws,&lt;ref name=Scarisbrick1&gt;{{cite book |last=Scarisbrick |first=Diana |date=1994 |title=Jewellery in Britain 1066-1837 A Documentary, Social, Literary and Artistic Survey  |publisher=Michael Russell (Publishing) |page=1 |isbn=0859551903}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several monarchs (most notably the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]]s) continually called for stricter enforcement, especially at Court "to the intent there may be a difference of estates known by their apparel after the commendable custom in times past."&lt;ref&gt;http://elizabethan.org/sumptuary/ruffs-hose-swords.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
During the Medieval and Renaissance area in Italy, various towns passed sumptuary laws (''leggi suntuarie'') often in response to particular events or movements. For example, [[San Bernardino da Siena]], in his public sermons in Siena, thundered against the vanity of luxurious dress; this, however, was counterbalanced by the economic benefit that Siena derived as a manufacturer of items, including clothes, of luxury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accademiadeirozzi.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/numero6.pdf Accademia dei Rozzi], article titled ''L'importante e aparire: le leggi suntuarie a Siena e la loro funzione'', by Renato Legarini, page 13-15.&lt;/ref&gt; One source describes these type of laws as constantly published, and generally ignored. These laws, mostly aimed at female apparel, became sometimes a source of revenue for the state: the Florentine laws of 1415 restricted the luxury that could be worn by women, but exempted those willing to pay 50 florins a year.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=SiKODAAAQBAJ La Moda: Una storie dal Medioevo a oggi
By Giorgio Riello.&lt;/ref&gt; The laws were often quite specific. Low necklines were prohibited in [[Genoa]], [[Milan]], and Rome in the early 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;Payne, ''History of Costume'', p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; and laws restricting [[zibellini]] ([[sable]] [[fur]]s carried as fashion accessories) with heads and feet of precious metals and jewels were
issued in [[Bologna]] in 1545 and Milan in 1565.&lt;ref&gt;Netherton, Robin, and Gale R. Owen-Crocker, editors, ''Medieval Clothing and Textiles'', Volume 2, Woodbridge, Suffolk, UK, and Rochester, New York, the Boydell Press, 2006, {{ISBN|1-84383-203-8}}, pp. 128–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
[[Montaigne]]'s brief essay "On sumptuary laws" criticized 16th-century French laws, beginning: 
{{quote|The way by which our laws attempt to regulate idle and vain expenses in meat and clothes, seems to be quite contrary to the end designed ... For to enact that none but princes shall eat [[turbot]], shall wear [[velvet]] or gold [[lace]], and interdict these things to the people, what is it but to bring them into a greater esteem, and to set every one more agog to eat and wear them?}}
He also cites [[Plato]] and [[Zaleucus]].

==Early modern era==
In the [[early modern period]], sumptuary laws continued to be used to support native textile industries in the face of imports.  Prohibitions continued to be tied to rank and income and continued to be widely ignored.

===France===
In 1629 and 1633, [[Louis XIII of France]] issued edicts regulating "Superfluity of Dress" that prohibited anyone but princes and the nobility from wearing [[goldwork (embroidery)|gold embroidery]] or caps, shirts, collars and cuffs embroidered with metallic threads or lace,&lt;ref&gt;Kõhler, Carl: ''A History of Costume'', Dover Publications reprint, 1963, from 1928 Harrap translation from the German, {{ISBN|0-486-21030-8}}, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; and puffs, slashes, and bunches of ribbon were severely restricted.  As with other such laws, these were widely disregarded and laxly enforced.  A series of popular engravings by [[Abraham Bosse]] depicts the supposed effects of this law.&lt;ref&gt;Lefébure, Ernest: ''Embroidery and Lace: Their Manufacture and History from the Remotest Antiquity to the Present Day'', p.230&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial America===
In the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], only people with a personal fortune of at least two hundred pounds could wear [[lace]], silver or gold thread or [[button]]s, [[cutwork]], [[embroidery]], hatbands, belts, ruffles, capes, and other articles.  After a few decades, the law was being widely defied.&lt;ref&gt;Linda M. Scott, ''Fresh Lipstick: Redressing Fashion and Feminism'' p 24 {{ISBN|1-4039-6686-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.constitution.org/primarysources/sumptuary.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era==
{{Main article|Clothing laws by country}}

While there are rarely restrictions on the type or quality of clothing, beyond maintenance of [[Indecent exposure|public decency]] (covering parts of the body, depending upon the [[jurisdiction]]; not exhibiting unacceptable wording or images), it is widely forbidden to wear certain types of clothing restricted to specific occupations, specifically the [[uniform]]s of organisations such as [[police]] and the [[military]].

In some jurisdictions clothing or other visible signs of religious or political opinion (e.g. Nazi imagery in Germany) are forbidden in certain public places.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/node/65142 Eurasianet.org: Uzbekistan Goes After Islam with Clothing Ban and Cameras, 16 March 2012.] "A 1998 law forbids Uzbeks from wearing religious clothing in public.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtamu.edu/webres/File/Journals/MCJ/aydin.pdf Hasan Aydin, University of Nevada, Reno: Headscarf (Hijab) Ban in Turkey: importance of veiling.] "Turkey has implemented a ban on the use of the Hijab, or the headscarf, in state controlled areas like universities, government offices, and other public places."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21997089 BBC: Islamic headscarf debate rekindled in France, 2 April 2013.]  "Conspicuous signs of religious affiliation, including Islamic headscarves, are banned from French state schools, and full-face veils (burkas and niqabs) cannot be worn in public places."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The German Strafgesetzbuch (Criminal Code) in §86a outlaws "use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations".&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[United States law|American states]] in the 20th century prohibited the wearing of [[KKK]] hoods, masks, masquerade, or [[drag (clothing)|drag]]; gay men in New York City seized on the exemption for [[masquerade ball]]s in the 1920s to 1930s to go in drag.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Chauncey]], ''Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Making of the Gay Male World, 1890–1940''. Basic Books, 1995. pp. 169-175, nn. 55-58; 295-296, nn. 77-79 {{ISBN|0-465-02621-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proscription or requirement of native dress==
Sumptuary laws have also been used to control populations by prohibiting the wearing of [[national dress|native dress]] and hairstyles, along with the proscription of other cultural customs.  [[John Perrot|Sir John Perrot]], Lord Deputy of Ireland under Elizabeth I, banned the wearing of traditional woollen mantles, "open smocks" with "great sleeves", and native headdresses, requiring the people to dress in "civil garments" in the English style.&lt;ref&gt;Berleth, Richard: ''The Twilight Lords'', 1978, Barnes and Noble reprint 1994, {{ISBN|1-56619-598-5}}, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar manner, the [[Dress Act 1746|Dress Act of 1746]], part of the [[Act of Proscription]] issued under [[George II of Great Britain|King George II of Great Britain]] following the [[Jacobite risings]], made wearing Scottish [[Highland dress]] including [[tartan]]s and [[kilt]]s illegal in Scotland for anyone not in the British military.  The Act was repealed in 1782, having been largely successful, and a few decades later, "romantic" Highland dress was enthusiastically adopted by [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] on a [[Walter Scott]]-inspired [[Visit of King George IV to Scotland|visit to Scotland]] in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, John Telfer: ''The Costume of Scotland'', 1981, Batsford edition 1989, {{ISBN|0-7134-2535-0}}, p. 50-105 ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bhutan]], the wearing of traditional dress (which also has an ethnic connotation) in certain places, such as when visiting government offices, was made compulsory in 1989 under the [[driglam namzha]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51617.htm US State Dept (two passages)] and [http://www.crin.org./docs/resources/treaties/crc.27/Bhutan.doc Submission to UN Committee, p.4]&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the traditional dress includes the [[kabney]], a long scarf whose coloring is regulated. Only the [[Druk Gyalpo|King of Bhutan]] and [[Je Khenpo|Chief Abbot]] may don the saffron scarf, with various other colors reserved for government and religious officers, and white available for common people.

==Pejorative uses of the term ''sumptuary law''==

The term ''sumptuary law'' has been used as a [[pejorative]] term to describe any governmental control of consumption, whether based on moral, religious, health, or public safety concerns. American Judge [[Thomas M. Cooley]] generally described their modern form as laws that "substitute the legislative judgment for that of the proprietor, regarding the manner in which he should use and employ his property."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas M. Cooley]], ''Treatise on the Constitutional Limitations which Rest upon the Legislative Power of the States of the American Union'', The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.; 5th edition (April 1998) (1868)&lt;/ref&gt; Policies to which the term has been critically applied include [[prohibition|alcohol prohibition]],&lt;ref name="Everett Sommerville Brown 1938"&gt;Everett Sommerville Brown, ''Ratification of the Twenty-First Amendment to the United States Constitution'', (University of Michigan: 1938)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prohibition of drugs|drug prohibition]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.leg.wa.gov/documents/billdocs/1999-00/Htm/Initiatives/Initiative%20To%20The%20Legislature/INITIATIVE%20248.htm Washington State Initiative 229]&lt;/ref&gt; [[smoking ban]]s,&lt;ref&gt;''Johns-Manville Sales Corp. v.

===Alcohol prohibition===
{{main article|Prohibition}}
As early as 1860, [[Anthony Trollope]], writing about his experiences in [[Maine]] under [[Maine law|the state's prohibition law]], stated, "This law (prohibition), like all sumptuary laws, must fail."&lt;ref&gt;[http://pressherald.mainetoday.com/specialrpts/alcohol/d1hist.htm "A History of Alcohol," ''Portland Press Herald'', October 19, 1997].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, [[William Howard Taft]] decried [[prohibition in the United States]] as a bad sumptuary law, stating that one of his reasons for opposing prohibition was his belief that "sumptuary laws are matters for parochial adjustment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,731975,00.html?promoid=googlep ''Burton, Baker, Taft''], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine (October 15, 1928).&lt;/ref&gt; Taft later repeated this concern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,928319-2,00.html [[Charles Phelps Taft]], "No Taft could", ''Time Magazine'', December 10, 1928]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of Indiana]] also discussed alcohol prohibition as a sumptuary law in its 1855 decision ''Herman v. State''.&lt;ref&gt;''Herman v. State'', 8 Ind. 545 (1855).&lt;/ref&gt; During state conventions on the ratification of the [[21st Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]] in 1933, numerous delegates throughout the United States decried prohibition as having been an improper sumptuary law that never should have been included in the [[Constitution of the United States]].&lt;ref name="Everett Sommerville Brown 1938"/&gt;

In 1971, a United States federal study stated that federal laws on alcohol include "sumptuary laws which are directed at the purchaser", including, "Sales are not permitted to minors or intoxicated persons. Credit is often prohibited on liquor sales as well. Criminal penalties may be imposed for driving under the influence of alcohol as well as for drunken behavior."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druglibrary.org/Schaffer/LIBRARY/studies/nc/nc2a.htm Jane Lang McGrew, ''History of Alcohol Prohibition''], published for the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug prohibition===

When the U.S. State of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] considered [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] [[Decriminalization of non-medicinal marijuana in the United States|decriminalization]] in two initiatives, 229 and 248, the initiatives' language stated, "Cannabis prohibition is a sumptuary law of a nature repugnant to our Constitution's framers."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10207">'''Virgin boy eggs''' are a traditional dish of [[Dongyang, Zhejiang]], [[China]] in which eggs are boiled in the urine of young boys who were presumably peasants, preferably under the age of ten. Named "tong zi dan" ([[Simplified Chinese characters|Chinese]]: 童子蛋; [[pinyin]]: ''Tóngzǐdàn''), the dish translates literally to "boy egg" and is a springtime tradition of the city where the urine is collected from prepubescent peasant boys. The eggs have been listed by officials in China as a part of the region's "local [[intangible cultural heritage]]".&lt;ref name="tofu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ministryoftofu.com/2011/03/boy-urine-soaked-eggs-listed-as-local-specialty-intangible-cultural-heritage/ |title=Boys’ urine-soaked eggs listed as local specialty, intangible cultural heritage &amp;#124; Ministry of Tofu 豆腐部 |publisher=Ministryoftofu.com |date=March 11, 2011 |access-date=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The dish is a long-standing tradition of Dongyang and its practices date back centuries. In general, China has had a long history of food preservation methods. [[Tea eggs]] were originally developed to preserve the food for long periods of time. While the boy eggs may not have necessarily had the same origin, their development comes from a similar cultural background.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt; There is no good explanation for why it must be boys' urine, specifically. It has simply been so for centuries.&lt;ref name="huff"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/29/virgin-boy-eggs_n_1387312.html |title=‘Virgin Boy Eggs’ Cooked In Urine Are Spring Delicacy In Dongyang, China |last1=Chan |first1=Royston |date=May 29, 2012 |publisher=Huffington Post |access-date=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is historically believed in the region that urine has various health benefits and was commonly ingested in ancient times.&lt;ref name="tofu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="world"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/03/29/10922289-urine-soaked-virgin-boy-eggs-are-a-springtime-taste-treat-in-china |title=Urine-soaked 'virgin boy eggs' are a springtime taste treat in China |last1=Song |first1=Aly |date=March 29, 2012 |publisher=nbcnews |access-date=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huff" /&gt; In such times, eggs were one of the only nutritional food items available to peasants and farmers. Due to Zhejiang's hilly and riverside landscapes, agriculture has been a staple in the region's culture for centuries. Although rice was the most widely grown crop, most peasants raised their own pigs and poultry on their land as well.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academic.eb.com/levels/collegiate/article/117333 |title=Zhejiang |last1=Fu Hung |first1=Frederick |last2=Falkenheim |first2=Victor C. |date=March 27, 2013 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |access-date=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the eggs' availability to the common person and, with the supposedly added benefit of urine at the time, the virgin boy eggs grew in popularity. The dish's traditional nature stems from the historical tendency of [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese food culture]] to place more care on the detailed history of a specific food. Virgin boy eggs are one example of how Chinese food culture attaches more importance to the anecdotes relating to food, such as its time of invention or the significant historical figures related to the food's invention.&lt;ref name="text"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1346774351|title=Functionalism Theory Applied in C-E Translation of Chinese Food Culture Text |last1=Yue |first1=Siwei |publisher=ACADEMY PUBLISHER |access-date=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differs historically from the western food culture which places more importance on a dish's ingredients and the skills necessary for its preparation. Although the exact history is somewhat obscure to most official sources, the long-standing trend of Chinese food explains the people of Dongyang's loyalty to a traditional dish to which many others find an aversion.

==Preparation==
The dish is prepared by first soaking the eggs in the urine of young boys. The urine is sourced locally by each vendor. Then, the mixture is heated over a stove. After boiling, the egg shells are cracked around the entire surface of the egg. Afterwards, the eggs are placed back into the urine. The used urine is then replaced with fresh urine and the process is repeated. The soaking process allows the eggs to  become [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]] in the urine as they are left to simmer. The entire process is generally a day-long endeavor.&lt;ref name="tofu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="world" /&gt; According to some recipes, different herbs may also be added to the marinade. When finished, the eggs whites have a pale golden hue and the yolks turn green.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/23/world/what-in-the-world/china-dongyang-eggs-urine.html?partner=bloomberg |title=Recipe for a Chinese Ritual Dish: Eggs, Time and Plenty of Urine |last1=Levin |first1=Dan |date=July 22, 2016 |access-date=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virgin boy eggs are similar to [[century eggs]] in their curing process and historical roots, although century eggs have become much more popularly widespread and do not use urine.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

==Modern culture==
Virgin boy eggs are widely accepted as a time-honored tradition of the city, rather than considered taboo like most other cultures.&lt;ref name="tofu" /&gt; Boy egg vendors go to elementary schools in the city where they collect urine from young boys, preferably under the age of ten. The children, having been raised in the city and its culture, are used to the practice. As young boys would in schools from many other cultures, they excuse themselves from class when they feel the urge to urinate. However, instead of going to the restroom, they relieve themselves in the basin that the vendors place in the hallways. Some vendors go as far as to wait with containers in parks or public restrooms for a parent who is willing to let their child offer urine.&lt;ref name="tofu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; The teachers, being accustomed to the tradition as well, often remind the boys to not urinate in the basin if any of them have a fever or feel ill.&lt;ref name="tofu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; In addition to buying them from street vendors, residents of Dongyang are also known to cook and prepare the eggs at home, using the urine from household boys.&lt;ref name="world" /&gt; Although modern medical research provides evidence that there are no health benefits from ingesting urine, the virgin boy eggs remain deeply rooted in tradition. As of 2012, the eggs are sold for about 1.50 yuan (approximately $0.24) per egg and are approximately twice the price of normal eggs.&lt;ref name="world" /&gt; However, not all of Dongyang's residents enjoy the dish. One local man was quoted stating, "The smell kills me. I feel like throwing up at the thought of it. It stinks.”&lt;ref name="tofu" /&gt; In general, virgin boy eggs remain highly acclaimed by the people of Dongyang for both its taste and even its "fragrant" smell.&lt;ref name="world" /&gt;

==Health effects and folk medicine==
[[Urophagia]] has been a significant part of Chinese medicine for much of its history. In ancient times, urine was used as a means of enhancing the effects of medicine, although today, the practice is widely viewed as unsanitary by many. It is widely speculated, however, that when urine dries it crystallizes resulting in a substance similar to the Chinese medicine, [[ren zhong bai]]. The crystallized urine sediment is said to aid in the mitigation of inflammation and inflammatory diseases as well as [[Mycosis|fungal infections]] of the skin and mouth.&lt;ref name="thrush"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Le-ping |first=Wang |date=1994 |title="The Treatment of 75 Cases of Pediatric Oral Thrush with the Sweet, Cold, Protecting Yin Method" |journal=Shang Hai Zhong Yi Yao Za Zhi (The Shanghai Journal of Chinese Medicine &amp; Medicinals) |issue=5 |pages=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some claim that the ingestion of the urine-soaked eggs can treat [[yin deficiency]], decrease one's internal body heat, and promote blood circulation.&lt;ref name="tofu" /&gt; Locals claim, based on anecdotal evidence, that the eggs also prevent [[heat stroke]].&lt;ref name="world" /&gt; Although not the only one, it was widely believed in ancient China that eggs cured in one's own urine for seven days and consumed for a course of three months was a cure for chronic [[asthma]]. Among other uses for urine in Chinese medicine, a young boy's first urine of the day is very powerful and may be combined with herbs to make a [[Herbal tonic|tonic]].&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Deutsch |first1=Jonathan |last2=Murakhver |first2=Natalya |date=January 1, 2012 |title=They Eat That? A Cultural Encyclopedia of Weird and Exotic Food from Around the World |url=http://vv4kg5gr5v.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fsummon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&amp;rft.genre=bookitem&amp;rft.title=They+Eat+That%3F+A+Cultural+Encyclopedia+of+Weird+and+Exotic+Food+from+around+the+World&amp;rft.atitle=Urine&amp;rft.date=2012-01-01&amp;rft.isbn=9780313380587&amp;rft.externalDocID=20400340&amp;paramdict=en-US |location=United States of America |publisher=Jonathan Deutsch and Natalya Murakhver |page=190,204,205 |isbn=978-0-313-38059-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern medical practitioners remain dubious of any health benefits of the virgin boy eggs and urophagia in general. Skepticism comes from the fact that urination is a bodily mechanism for excreting waste. Evidence-based modern medicine has determined that urine "is waste expelled from the human body and basically contains no substance conducive to human health." Eating the eggs is therefore discouraged by many medical practitioners.&lt;ref name="tofu" /&gt;
