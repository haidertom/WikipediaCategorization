'''Amelogenin, X isoform''' is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ''AMELX'' (amelogenin, X isoform) [[gene]].&lt;ref name="entrez"&gt;{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: amelogenin (amelogenesis imperfecta 1| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=265| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protein Amelogenin, X isoform is an isoform of [[amelogenin]] that comes from the [[X chromosome]].&lt;ref name="urlAceView"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Acembly/av.cgi?db=human&amp;l=AMELX | title = AceView: Gene:AMELX, a comprehensive annotation of human, mouse and worm genes with mRNAs or ESTsAceView | author = | authorlink = | date = | format = | website = | publisher = National Center for Biotechnology Information, United States National Institutes of Health | pages = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1734713"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Salido EC, Yen PH, Koprivnikar K, Yu LC, Shapiro LJ | title = The human enamel protein gene amelogenin is expressed from both the X and the Y chromosomes | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 50 | issue = 2 | pages = 303–16 | date = Feb 1992 | pmid = 1734713 | pmc = 1682460 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The protein Amelogenin is a type of extracellular matrix protein, and is involved in the process of [[amelogenesis]], the formation of enamel on teeth. Amelogenin X is a member of the amelogenin family of [[extracellular matrix]] proteins.  When alternative splicing occurs, it results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms, which in humans results in amelogenin genes on both the X and Y chromosomes.&lt;ref name="urlAceView"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1734713"/&gt;

== Function ==

AMELX is involved in [[biomineralisation|biomineralization]] during [[tooth enamel]] development.&lt;ref name="pmid11406633"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gibson CW, Yuan ZA, Hall B, Longenecker G, Chen E, Thyagarajan T, Sreenath T, Wright JT, Decker S, Piddington R, Harrison G, Kulkarni AB | title = Amelogenin-deficient mice display an amelogenesis imperfecta phenotype | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 276 | issue = 34 | pages = 31871–5 | date = Aug 2001 | pmid = 11406633 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M104624200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AMELX gene encodes for the structural modeling protein, amelogenin, which works with other amelogenesis-related proteins to direct the mineralisation of enamel. This process involves the organization of [[enamel rods]], the basic unit of tooth enamel, as well as the inclusion and growth of hydroxyapatite crystals.

== Clinical significance ==

Mutations in the AMELX gene can result in [[amelogenesis imperfecta]], which refers to the collection of enamel defects resulting from either genetic or environmental causes.&lt;ref name="pmid16838342"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright JT | title = The molecular etiologies and associated phenotypes of amelogenesis imperfecta | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A | volume = 140 | issue = 23 | pages = 2547–55 | date = Dec 2006 | pmid = 16838342 | pmc = 1847600 | doi = 10.1002/ajmg.a.31358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that mice with a knocked-out AMELX gene will present disorganized and hypoplastic enamel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li Y, Suggs C, Wright JT, Yuan ZA, Aragon M, Fong H, Simmons D, Daly B, Golub EE, Harrison G, Kulkarni AB, Gibson CW | title = Partial rescue of the amelogenin null dental enamel phenotype | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 283 | issue = 22 | pages = 15056–15062 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18390542 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M707992200 | pmc=2397487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anemophily''' or '''wind pollination''' is a form of [[pollination]] whereby [[pollen]] is distributed by [[wind]].&lt;ref name="Shukla"&gt;{{cite book |author1=A. K. Shukla |author2=M. R. Vijayaraghavan |author3=Bharti Chaudhry |year=1998 |title=Biology Of Pollen |publisher=[[APH Publishing]] |isbn=9788170249245 |chapter=Abiotic pollination |pages=67–69 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfSlwa0BnDgC&amp;pg=PA67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all [[gymnosperm]]s are anemophilous, as are many plants in the order [[Poales]], including [[Poaceae|grasses]], [[Cyperaceae|sedges]] and [[Juncaceae|rushes]].&lt;ref name="Shukla"/&gt; Other common anemophilous plants are [[oak]]s, [[sweet chestnut]]s, [[alder]]s and members of the family [[Juglandaceae]] (hickory or walnut family).

==Syndrome==
Features of the wind-pollination syndrome include a lack of scent production, a lack of showy floral parts (resulting in inconspicuous flowers), reduced production of [[nectar]], and the production of enormous numbers of pollen grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author =Dave Moore |chapter=Insects of palm flowers and fruits |editor=F.W. Howard |editor2=D. Moore |editor3=R.M. Giblin-Davis |editor4=R.G. Abad |year=2001 |title=Insects on Palms |publisher=[[CAB International]] |isbn=9780851997056 |pages=233–266 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IL5jorrwFLYC&amp;pg=PA233}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinguishes them from [[entomophily|entomophilous]] and [[zoophily|zoophilous]] species (whose pollen is spread by [[insect]]s and [[vertebrate]]s respectively).

Anemophilous [[pollen]] grains are light and non-sticky, so that they can be transported by air currents. They are typically {{convert|20|-|60|um|4}} in diameter, although the pollen grains of ''[[Pinus]]'' species can be much larger and much less dense.&lt;ref name="Shukla"/&gt; Anemophilous plants possess well-exposed [[stamen]]s so that the pollens are exposed to wind currents and also have large and feathery [[stigma (botany) | stigma]] to easily trap airborne pollen grains. Pollen from anemophilous plants tends to be smaller and lighter than pollen from entomophilous ones, with very low nutritional value to insects. However, insects sometimes gather pollen from staminate anemophilous flowers at times when higher-[[protein]] pollens from entomophilous flowers are scarce. Anemophilous pollens may also be inadvertently captured by [[bee]]s' [[electrostatic]] field. This may explain why, though bees are not observed to visit [[ragweed]] flowers, its [[Melissopalynology|pollen is often found]] in [[honey]] made during the ragweed floral bloom. Other flowers that are generally anemophilous are observed to be actively worked by bees, with solitary bees often visiting [[Poaceae|grass]] flowers, and the larger [[honeybee]]s and [[bumblebee]]s frequently gathering pollen from [[maize|corn]] tassels and other grains.

Anemophily is an [[adaptation]] that helps to separate the male and female reproductive systems of a single plant, reducing the effects of [[inbreeding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =J. D. Ackerman |year=2000 |title=Abiotic pollen and pollination: ecological, functional, and evolutionary perspectives |journal=[[Plant Systematics and Evolution]] |volume=222 |issue=1–4 |pages=167–185 |doi=10.1007/BF00984101}}&lt;/ref&gt; It often accompanies [[dioecy]] – the presence of male and female reproductive structures on separate plants.

==Allergies==
Almost all pollens that are [[allergen]]s are from anemophilous species.&lt;ref name="Emberlin"&gt;{{cite book |author =Jean Emberlin |editor1=A. Barry Kay |editor2=Allen P. Kaplan |editor3=Jean Bousquet |editor4=Patrick G. Holt |year=2009 |series=Allergy and Allergic Diseases |volume=1 |title=The Scientific Basis of Allergy |edition=2nd |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=9781444300925 |chapter=Grass, tree, and weed pollen |pages=942–962 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_3T1ZXvP5YC&amp;pg=PA943}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grasses ([[Poaceae]]) are the most important producers of aeroallergens in most temperate regions, with lowland or meadow species producing more pollen than upland or [[moorland]] species.&lt;ref name="Emberlin"/&gt;

'''Anne Hooper''' (born 1941) is a British sex therapist&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9ZkbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9FIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5260,4003083&amp;dq=anne-hooper&amp;hl=en|title=Sex By The Book: Sizing Up The Bedside Reading|last=Murray|first=Linda|date=13 February 1993|work=[[The Dispatch (Lexington)|The Dispatch]]|page=19|accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and author, who pioneered [[therapy]] groups for women with sex problems in the 1970s and 1980s and who wrote UK newspaper columns on the subject of human sexuality in the 1990s.

== Books ==
Since beginning a career as an author in the late 1970s she has written over 40 titles on the subject of sex therapy and sexual enhancement. These include ''The Ultimate Sex Guide'' and ''21st Century [[Kama Sutra]]''.

Her book ''Hot, Hot, Hot: The Body Electric'' has been described as “a seminal work”{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} and has been in print for over 30 years while ''Divorce and Your Children'' was the first{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} UK based book on the subject and has also been in print for over 30 years.  She is author of the popular psychology book ''[[Alfred Adler|Adler]] for Beginners'' and an innovative work on the links between [[evolutionary psychology]] and sexual function in Sex: the Manual aka How Was It For You?

== Counseling ==
Hooper is a marital [[Marriage counseling|counselor]], a sex therapist (BASRT) and was part of the first wave of pioneer UK sex therapists.  She founded the Women's Sexuality Workshop in the late 1970s, is a UK listed [[psychotherapist]], a former council member of the Adlerian Society for Individual Psychology of Great Britain, and Founding Editor of the Adlerian Yearbook

== Journalism and radio ==
Hooper was a regular columnist on the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', introducing sexual subject matter to its readers in the early 1990s and also had columns in ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', ''First Magazine'', ''Best'', and ''Bella''.  As a reforming [[feminist]], she ensured that her writing was non-sexist at a time when others had not yet adapted their attitudes.  She was a long-term radio presenter of the Counselling Programme on LBC in London and the first [[agony aunt]] for the first national cable television station in the UK (Wire TV).  Currently she is consultant to Amora – the Academy of Sex and Relationships.

She has been a trustee for the Post Abortion Counselling Service (PACS) a regional committee member of the Family Planning Association and is presently assisting Ataxia UK.

== Film work ==
Hooper is the founder of the Tetbury Film Society and now works with the British Federation of Film Societies – South West to further film viewing in remote regions of South West England.

The '''British Nutrition Foundation''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Charitable organization#Charity registration|registered charity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|251681}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Scottish charity|SC040061}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been criticised for conflicts of interest and for acting as an industry lobby group.&lt;ref name=BMJSpinwatch/&gt;

==History==
It was founded in 1967 by Professor Alastair Frazer. In 1973 it held its first annual conference. It is based between [[Holborn tube station|Holborn]] and [[Chancery Lane tube station|Chancery Lane]] tube stations. The BNF educational programme, ''Food - a fact of life'', was launched in 1991.

==Aims==
According to its entry in the Charity Commission's register, the aims of the British Nutrition Foundation are:
#to advance the education of the public, and those involved in the training and education of others, in nutrition; and
#to advance the study of and research into nutrition for the public benefit, and to disseminate and publish the useful results of such research.&lt;ref name=CharityCommission&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=251681&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|title= Charity framework|publisher= [[Charity Commission for England and Wales]]|location= London|accessdate= 4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
The BNF's team of nutrition scientists conduct academic reviews of published research on issues of diet and public health.&lt;ref name=BNFScienceProg&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Programme|url=http://www.nutrition.org.uk/aboutbnf/values/who-we-are-what-we-do?start=2|publisher=British Nutrition Foundation|accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They present their reports in the BNF's Nutrition Bulletin, as well as various Task Force reports, intended for both academic and lay dissemination.&lt;ref name=BNFScienceProg/&gt; The BNF also organises educational programs designed to provide accessible information on diet and health for children and young people, aged 3–16+ years.&lt;ref name=BNFEducation&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Programme|url=http://www.nutrition.org.uk/aboutbnf/values/who-we-are-what-we-do?start=1|publisher=British Nutrition Foundation|accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BNF's education website, foodafactoflife.org.uk, provides teaching and learning resources about food and nutrition.&lt;ref name=BNFEducation/&gt;

The BNF receives funding for its projects from a variety of sources, including contracts with the European Commission, national government departments and agencies; food producers and manufacturers, retailers and food service companies; grant providing bodies, trusts and other charities.&lt;ref name=BNFWhoWeAre&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nutrition.org.uk/aboutbnf/values/who-we-are-what-we-do|title= Who we are, what we do|year= 2009|publisher= British Nutrition Foundation|location= London|accessdate= 4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Concerns have been raised about the BNF's close relationship with the food industry.&lt;ref name=BMJSpinwatch&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://spinwatch.org/-articles-by-category-mainmenu-8/40-pr-industry/5353-independence-of-nutritional-information-the-british-nutrition-foundation|title= Independence of nutritional information?|publisher= [[British Medical Journal]]|location= London|accessdate= 23 February 2012|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120425125849/http://spinwatch.org/-articles-by-category-mainmenu-8/40-pr-industry/5353-independence-of-nutritional-information-the-british-nutrition-foundation|archivedate= 25 April 2012|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BNF receives funding from almost every large food manufacturer and distributor in the UK, including [[Tate and Lyle]], [[Nestle]], [[PepsiCo]], [[McDonald's]] and [[Sainsburys]].

Furthermore, Paul Hebblethwaite, a member of the BNF board of trustees and its former chairman, has had "a distinguished career in the food industry working for a number of major companies including [[Cadbury-Schweppes]] and [[Chivers-Hartley]]".&lt;ref name=BNFNews&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nutrition.org.uk/attachments/288_Issue%2047%20Spring%202009.pdf|title= BNF News|publisher= British Nutrition Foundation|location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also chairman of the Biscuit, Cake, Chocolate and Confectionery Trade Association.&lt;ref name=BNFNews/&gt; Many other members of the organisation’s board of trustees and oversight committees are or have been employees of the food industry.&lt;ref name=BNFReport09&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nutrition.org.uk/attachments/330_BNF%20Annual%20Report%202008%2009.pdf|title= Annual Report and Accounts|publisher= British Nutrition Foundation|location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BNF is open about its intention to shape UK Government policy on food,&lt;ref name=BNFWhoWeAre/&gt; and this has led to concerns that it is serving as a lobbying group for the food industry which largely funds it.&lt;ref name=BMJSpinwatch/&gt; Derek Shrimpton, former director general, has been quoted as saying: "In the period I was there the foundation was solely taken up with defence actions for the industry." He said that the foundation had been constantly engaged in frustrating government committees aiming to recommend reductions in sugars, salt, and fats.&lt;ref name=CannonG&gt;{{cite book|last=Cannon|first=G|title=The Politics of Food|year=1997|publisher=Century|location=London|pages=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manglawar Stupa.JPG|thumb|Shakhorai Buddha]]
[[Manglawar]] (or Manglor) valley in Pakistan is situated about 9 Km to North East of [[Mingora]], at the point where a number of side valleys descend from the watershed range to the east. The valley has a number of Buddhist [[Relief sculpture|reliefs]] and sculptures, the best known of which is the Shakhorai Buddha.

== The valley's archaeological importance ==

The Swat Valley contained a large number of monasteries, forming a sacred landscape where images, sculptures and inscriptions welcomed pilgrims as they entered the valley.&lt;ref name="Buddha Restored 1"&gt;(13 July, 2018). [https://tribune.com.pk/story/1756539/1-buddha-statue-restored-swat/ Buddha Statue Restored in Swat]. [[The Express Tribune]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe that the valley is the site of [[Oddiyana]], a small medieval kingdom that played a crucial role in the development and dissemination of [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], and the homeland of the sages [[Indrabhuti|Indrabhūti]] and [[Padmasambhava]].&lt;ref&gt;Filigenzi, Anna (2015). [https://verlag.oeaw.ac.at/art-and-landscape Buddhist Rock Sculptures of Late Antiqe Swat/Uddiyana]. Pub: VÖAW. {{ISBN|978-3-7001-7241-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As one enters the sub-valley of Manglawar its importance is immediately revealed with the huge and well known rock relief of the '''Shakhorai Buddha'''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giuseppe Tucci |G. Tucci]], ''Preliminary report on an archelogical survey in Swat,'' East and West, vol. 9, P:306&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of sub-valley Manglawar can be judged from the accounts of [[Aurel Stein|Sir. Aural Stein]], he says:
{{blockquote|Of all the Buddhist relieves found on the rock near Manglawar and miles up the valley the colossal image of a seated Buddha some thirteen feet in height is certainly the most striking. It is carved on the vertical face of a high reddish rock, high above the narrow terrace at its foot, and is a well-executed piece of work. This position, while it had saved the relievo from damage by pious vandals, has at the same time made it distinctly difficult to photograph. The hands of the true believers much often have itched as they saw this benign-faced heathen idol looking down towards Manglawar from its heights of some three hundred feet above Shakhorai hamlet"''”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aurel Stein|A.Stein]], ''On Alexender track to Indus'', (1972), P:77-78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.cambridge.org/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9781139923538&amp;cid=CBO9781139923538A018 X - Buddhist Remains about Saidu and Manglawar]  pp. 72-80&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This Buddha seated statue is most famous because it is the second largest '''Buddha Statue''' (formally called as '''Budh Ghat''') in [[central Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Enroute_to_Janabad_-_Swat.jpg Enroute to Janabad - Swat.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conservation: [http://tribune.com.pk/story/399128/conservation-defaced-buddha-sculpture-gets-facelift/ Defaced Buddha sculpture gets facelift], Tribune, ''Published: June 26, 2012''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/news/729361/buddha-attacked-by-taliban-gets-facelift-in-pakistan Buddha attacked by Taliban gets facelift in Pakistan], Dawn, ''Published: June 25, 2012''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pakistan-explorer.com/articles/italian-archeologist-luca-olivieri-returns-to-swat-for-the-preservation-of-buddhist-statues-destroyed-by-taliban Italian Archeologist Luca Olivieri returns to Swat for the preservation of Buddhist Statues destroyed by Taliban], Pakistan-Explorer, ''Published: June 30, 2012''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[First Battle of Swat|2007]] the Taliban tried to destroy the head of the relief with explosives, although ultimately only the top part of the Buddha’s head was damaged. The carving has since been restored by the Italian Archaeological Mission in Swat. A coating was applied to protect the damaged part of the carving in 2012, and next the face was restored in [[3D reconstruction|3D]] using laser surveys and old photographs. Finally, it was physically restored using parts of the original that had been picked up off the valley floor. The restoration was completed in October 2016, deliberately leaving some of the damage visible.&lt;ref name="Buddha Restored 1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamad Ali, Syed (January 24, 2018).

A '''catchphrase''' (alternatively spelled '''catch phrase''') is a phrase or expression recognized by its repeated utterance. Such phrases often originate in [[popular culture]] and in the arts, and typically spread through word of mouth and a variety of mass media (such as films, internet, literature and publishing, television and radio). Some become the de facto or literal "trademark" or "signature" of the person or character with whom they originated, and can be instrumental in the [[typecasting (acting)|typecasting]] of a particular actor.

==Culture==
According to Richard Harris, a psychology professor at [[Kansas State University]] who studied why people like to cite films in social situations, using film quotes in everyday conversation is similar to telling a joke and a way to form solidarity with others. "People are doing it to feel good about themselves, to make others laugh, to make themselves laugh", he said. He found that all of the participants in his study had used film quotes in conversation at one point or another. "They overwhelmingly cited comedies, followed distantly by dramas and action adventure flicks." Horror films, musicals and children's films were hardly ever cited.&lt;ref name="www.cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news| first=A | last=Pawlowski|title=You talkin' to me?

'''Chromosome microdissection''' is a technique that physically removes a large section of [[DNA]] from a complete [[chromosome]]. The smallest portion of DNA that can be isolated using this method comprises 10 million [[base pair]]s - hundreds or thousands of individual [[gene]]s.

Scientists who study chromosomes are known as [[cytogeneticist]]s. They are able to identify each chromosome based on its unique pattern of dark and light bands. Certain abnormalities, however, cause chromosomes to have unusual banding patterns. For example, one chromosome may have a piece of another chromosome inserted within it, creating extra bands. Or, a portion of a chromosome may be repeated over and over again, resulting in an unusually wide, dark band (known as a [[homogeneously staining region]]). Some chromosomal aberrations have been linked to [[cancer]] and inherited genetic disorders, and the chromosomes of many tumor cells exhibit irregular bands. To understand more about what causes these conditions, scientists hope to determine which genes and DNA sequences are located near these unusual bands. Chromosome microdissection is a specialized way of isolating these regions by removing the DNA from the band and making that DNA available for further study.

To prepare cells for chromosome microdissection, a scientist first treats them with a chemical that forces them into [[metaphase]]: a phase of the cell's life-cycle where the chromosomes are tightly coiled and highly visible. Next, the cells are dropped onto a [[microscope slide]] so that the nucleus, which holds all of the genetic material together, breaks apart and releases the chromosomes onto the slide. Then, under a microscope, the scientist locates the specific band of interest, and, using a very fine needle, tears that band away from the rest of the chromosome. The researcher next produces multiple copies of the isolated DNA using a procedure called [[PCR]] (polymerase chain reaction). The scientist uses these copies to study the DNA from the unusual region of the chromosome in question.

In [[media studies]], '''concision''' is a form of [[broadcast media]] [[censorship]] by limiting debate and discussion of important topics on the rationale of time allotment.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;[http://users.utu.fi/bredelli/C8.htm Finnish Views of CNN, Chapter 8: The Structural Constraint of "Concision" as it is Used in the Discourse Style of American Commercial Broadcasting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423095239/http://users.utu.fi/bredelli/C8.htm |date=2012-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media critics such as [[Noam Chomsky]] contend that this practice, especially on commercial broadcasts with [[advertising]], encourages broadcasters to exclude people and ideas that they judge cannot conform to the time limits of a particular program.  This leads to a limited number of "the usual suspects" who will say expected ideas that will not require extensive explanation such as mainstream political ones.


'''The beauty of concision, you know, saying a couple sentences between two commercials, the beauty of that is you can only repeat conventional thoughts. Suppose I go on Nightline, whatever it is, two minutes, and I say Gaddafi is a terrorist, Khomeini is a murderer etcetera etcetera…I don’t need any evidence, everyone just nods. On the other hand, suppose you’re saying something that isn’t just regurgitating conventional pieties, suppose you say something that’s the least bit unexpected or controversial, people will quite reasonably expect to know what you mean. If you said that you’d better have a reason, better have some evidence. You can’t give evidence if you’re stuck with concision. That’s the genius of this structural constraint.'''&lt;ref name="Chomsky"&gt;[https://ohtarzie.wordpress.com/2015/05/10/greenwald-on-chomsky-and-staying-in-the-mainstream-without-compromise/  Greenwald on Chomsky and Staying In the Mainstream Without Compromise]{{cite web |url=https://ohtarzie.wordpress.com/2015/05/10/greenwald-on-chomsky-and-staying-in-the-mainstream-without-compromise/}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, introducing controversial or unexpected statements that do not conform to those conventional ideas are discouraged as time inefficient because the person will be required to explain and support them in detail.  Since this can often take considerable time in itself and digress from the primary discussion topic of the broadcast, this is discouraged.  Alternatively, the explanation could be subject to extensive editing for time which could lead to an inadequate presentation of the subject's thoughts.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

==Illustration==

This media control idea is illustrated in the [[film documentary]], ''[[Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media]]'', where journalist [[Jeff Greenfield]] explains why a person like Chomsky may be excluded from being interviewed on air because he takes too long to warm up. The film then follows up with Chomsky himself explaining the concept while the film gives examples of controversial statements he has made in the past that would require extensive explanation in an interview.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

The 1999 feature film ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]'' has a dramatization of the media concept where journalist [[Mike Wallace]] goes public on a news show about the censoring of a controversial story on ''[[60 Minutes]]''.  When Wallace sees his interview broadcast, he is furious that his testimony is limited to a curt statement that does not adequately explain his position and the only excuse from the producers he receives is that it had to be cut for time.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

The '''[[Direct current|DC]] distribution system''' has been proposed, as a replacement for the present [[Alternating current|AC]] power distribution system for ships with electric propulsion.

This concept represents a new way of distributing energy for low-voltage installations on ships. It can be used for any electrical ship application up to 20 megawatts and operates at a nominal voltage of 1000V DC. The DC distribution system is simply an extension of the multiple DC links that already exist in all propulsion and thruster drives, which usually account for more than 80 percent of the electrical power consumption on electric propulsion vessels.

==Benefits==
In addition to boosting efficiency by up to 20 percent, other benefits include space and weight savings of up to 30 percent and flexible placement of electrical equipment.&lt;ref name=20plus&gt;{{cite web 
 |title=DC distribution system - A significant step forward in electric propulsion increasing vessel efficiency up to 20%

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for significantly more cargo space and a more functional vessel layout where the electrical system is designed around the vessel functions and not vice versa.

The efficiency improvement is mainly achieved from the system no longer being locked at a specific frequency (usually 60&amp;nbsp;Hz on ships), even though a 60&amp;nbsp;Hz power source can also be connected to the grid. This new freedom of being able to control each power source totally independently opens up numerous ways of optimizing fuel consumption.
 
The reduced weight and footprint of the installed electrical equipment will vary depending on the ship type and application. One comparison using the DC distribution system instead of the traditional AC system for a Platform Supply Vessel (PSV), reduced the weight of the electrical system components from {{Convert|115520|kg|lbs}} to {{convert|85360|kg|lbs}}.

On land, the [[solar panel]]s on several buildings in Sweden are connected via DC to smooth production and consumption, bypassing the AC grid and its inverters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/likstrom-vaxlar-upp-ett-steg-till-6846362 |title=Likström växlar upp ett steg till|publisher=[[Ny Teknik]] |accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fuel savings==
The biggest potential for fuel savings lies in the ease with which energy storage devices, such as batteries or super capacitors, can be added to the system. Energy storage will help the engines level out load variations from the thrusters and other large loads.

===Operational optimization===

DC distribution system allows for new ways of thinking regarding operational optimization. The system is flexible and can combine different energy sources such as engines, turbines, and fuel cells. This means that there is the potential to implement an energy management system that takes into account varying fuel prices and the availability of different fuels.

==Challenges==

Because the main AC switchboard with its AC [[circuit breakers]] and protection relays is omitted from the new design, a new protection philosophy that fulfills class requirements is needed for selectivity and equipment protection. ABB has proposed a solution for protecting the DC distribution system using a combination of fuses and controlled turn-off semiconductor power devices. Because all energy-producing components have controllable switching devices, the fault current can be blocked much faster than is possible with traditional circuit breakers with associated protection relays.

[[Image:absolute complement.svg|200px|thumb|In this image, the '''universal set''' U (the entire rectangle) is dichotomized into the two sets A (in pink) and its complement A&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; (in grey).]]
A '''dichotomy''' {{IPAc-en|d|aɪ|ˈ|k|ɒ|t|ə|m|i}} is a [[partition of a set|partition]] of a whole (or a set) into two parts (subsets). In other words, this couple of parts must be
* [[jointly exhaustive]]: everything must belong to one part or the other, and
* [[mutually exclusive]]: nothing can belong simultaneously to both parts.

Such a partition is also frequently called a bipartition.

&lt;!-- this is a confused sentence - clearly ME and JE are NOT mutually exclusive, please re-phrase if you know how it works: 
These two ways to [[partition of a set|partition]] elements are themselves a dichotomy. --&gt;
The two parts thus formed are [[Complement (set theory)|complements]]. In [[logic]], the partitions are [[dual (category theory)|opposites]] if there exists a [[proposition]] such that it holds over one and not the other.

Treating [[continuous variable]]s or multi[[categorical variable]]s as [[binary variable]]s is called [[discretization|dichotomization]]. The [[discretization error]] inherent in dichotomization is temporarily ignored for [[conceptual model|modeling]] purposes.

== Etymology ==

The term ''dichotomy'' is from the Greek language {{lang-el|διχοτομία}} ''dichotomía'' "dividing in two" from δίχα ''dícha'' "in two, asunder" and τομή ''tomḗ'' "a cutting, incision".

== Usage and examples==

* The above applies directly when the term is used in [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], or [[linguistics]]. For example, if there is a concept A, and it is split into parts B and not-B, then the parts form a dichotomy: they are mutually exclusive, since no part of B is contained in not-B and vice versa, and they are jointly exhaustive, since they cover all of A, and together again give A.
* In [[set theory]], a dichotomous relation ''R'' is such that either ''aRb'', ''bRa'', but not both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Komjath|first1=Peter|last2=Totik|first2=Vilmos|title=Problems and Theorems in Classical Set Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rbCmt-2NxtIC&amp;lpg=PA497&amp;ots=_iKgXwG7Qa&amp;dq=dichotomous%20relation%20set%20theory&amp;pg=PA497#v=onepage&amp;q=dichotomous%20relation%20set%20theory&amp;f=false|website=Google Books|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|accessdate=17 September 2014|pages=497|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[statistics]], dichotomous data may only exist at first two [[levels of measurement]], namely at the [[nominal scale|nominal]] level of measurement (such as "British" vs "American" when measuring nationality) and at the [[ordinal scale|ordinal]] level of measurement (such as "tall" vs "short", when measuring height). A variable measured dichotomously is called a [[dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variable]]. 
* In the [[classification of mental disorders]] in [[psychiatry]] or [[clinical psychology]], dichotomous classification or [[categorization]] refers to the use of cut-offs intended to separate disorder from non-disorder at some level of abnormality, severity or disability.
* A [[false dichotomy]] is an [[informal fallacy]] consisting of a supposed dichotomy which fails one or both of the conditions: it is not jointly exhaustive and/or not mutually exclusive. In its most common form, two entities are presented as if they are exhaustive, when in fact other alternatives are possible. In some cases, they may be presented as if they are mutually exclusive although there is a broad middle ground (see also [[undistributed middle]]).
* The divine dichotomy is mentioned in the ''[[Conversations With God]]'' series of books by religious author [[Neale Donald Walsch]].
* In economics, the [[classical dichotomy]] is the division between the real side of the economy and the monetary side. According to the classical dichotomy, changes in monetary variables do not affect real values such as output, employment, and the real interest rate. Money is therefore neutral in the sense that its quantity cannot affect these real variables.
* In [[biology]], a dichotomy is a division of organisms into two groups, typically based on a characteristic present in one group and absent in the other. Such dichotomies are used as part of the process of identifying species, as part of a [[dichotomous key]], which asks a series of questions, each of which narrows down the set of organisms. A well known dichotomy is the question "does it have a backbone?" used to divide species into [[vertebrate]]s and [[invertebrate]]s.
* In [[botany]], a dichotomy is a mode of branching by repeated [[wikt:bifurcation|bifurcation]] - thus a focus on branching rather than on division.
* In [[computer science]], more specifically in programming-language engineering, dichotomies are fundamental dualities in a language's design. For instance, [[C++]] has a dichotomy in its memory model (heap versus stack), whereas Java has a dichotomy in its type system (references versus primitive data types).
* In the anthropological field of [[theology]] and in [[philosophy]], dichotomy is the belief that humans consist of a soul and a body. (See [[Mind-body dichotomy]].) This stands in contrast to [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|trichotomy]].
* Perceived dichotomies are common in Western thought. [[C. P. Snow]] believes that Western society has become an argument culture ([[The Two Cultures]]). In ''The Argument Culture'' (1998), [[Deborah Tannen]] suggests that the dialogue of Western culture is characterized by a warlike atmosphere in which the winning side has truth (like a trophy). Such a dialogue virtually ignores the middle alternatives.
* In [[sociology]] and [[semiotics]], dichotomies (also sometimes called 'binaries' and/or 'binarisms') are the subject of attention because they may form the basis to divisions and inequality. For example, the [[Domestic-public dichotomy|domestic–public dichotomy]] divides men's and women's roles in a society; the [[East-West dichotomy]] contrasts the [[Orient]] and the [[Western world|Occident]]. Some social scientists attempt to [[Deconstruction|deconstruct]] dichotomies in order to address the divisions and inequalities they create: for instance [[Judith Butler]]'s deconstruction of the [[gender]]-dichotomy (or [[gender binary]]) and [[Val Plumwood]]'s deconstruction of the human-[[social environment|environment]] dichotomy.
* The [[I Ching]] and [[taijitu]] represent the yin yang theories of traditional [[Chinese culture]]. However, these do not represent a true dichotomy as the symbol incorporates a portion of each in the other, representing a dialectic.
* In [[dialectical behavioral therapy]], a treatment shown to have some success in treating some clients with [[Borderline Personality Disorder]], an essential tool used is based on the idea of dichotomy. Dichotomy, in this case, is a self-defeating behavior using "all-or-nothing" or [[splitting (psychology)|"black-and-white" thinking]]. The therapy teaches the patient how to change the dichotomy to a more "[[dialectical]]" (or "seeing the middle ground") way of thinking.
* One type of dichotomy is dichotomous classification - classifying objects by recursively splitting them into two groups until all are separated and in their own unique category.
* [http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/mwc/16540/dichotomy Astronomy] defines a dichotomy as "the phase of the moon or an inferior planet in which half its disk appears illuminated".

[[Mathematical]] disabilities can occur as the result of some types of [[brain injury]], in which case the proper term, [[acalculia]], is to distinguish it from dyscalculia which is of innate, genetic or developmental origin.

== History ==
The term 'dyscalculia' was coined in the 1940s, but it was not completely recognized until 1974 by the work of [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakian]] researcher Ladislav Kosc. Kosc defined dyscalculia as "a structural disorder of mathematical abilities." His research proved that the learning disability was caused by impairments to certain parts of the brain that control mathematical calculations and not because symptomatic individuals were 'mentally handicapped'. Researchers now sometimes use the terms “math dyslexia” or “math learning disability” when they mention the condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/62436/11-facts-about-math-disorder-dyscalculia|title=11 Facts About the Math Disorder Dyscalculia|date=2015-04-06|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive disabilities specific to mathematics were originally identified in case studies with patients who experienced specific arithmetic disabilities as a result of damage to specific regions of the brain.  More commonly, dyscalculia occurs developmentally as a genetically linked learning disability which affects a person's ability to understand, remember, or manipulate numbers or number facts (e.g., the [[multiplication table]]s). The term is often used to refer specifically to the inability to perform arithmetic operations, but is also defined by some educational professionals and [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologists]] such as [[Stanislas Dehaene]]&lt;ref name="Dehaene1997"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Number Sense: How the Mind Creates Mathematics|last=Dehaene|first=S.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1997|isbn=978-0-19-513240-3|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brian Butterworth]]&lt;ref name="Butterworth, 2011" /&gt; as a more fundamental inability to conceptualize numbers as abstract concepts of comparative quantities (a deficit in "[[number sense]]"), which these researchers consider to be a foundational skill upon which other mathematics abilities build. Symptoms of dyscalculia include the delay of simple counting, inability to memorize simple arithmetic facts such as adding, subtracting, etc. There are few known symptoms because little research has been done on the topic.&lt;ref name="Butterworth, 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butterworth, 2011" /&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
The earliest appearance of dyscalculia is typically a deficit in the ability to know, from a brief glance and without counting, how many objects there are in a small group (see [[subitizing]]). Children as young as 5 can subitize 6 objects, especially looking at a die. However, children with dyscalculia can subitize fewer objects and even when correct take longer to identify the number than their age-matched peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Subitizing and visual counting in children with problems in acquiring basic arithmetic skills | journal = Optometry &amp; Vision Development | year = 2008 | first1 = B  | last1 = Fischer |first2= C |last2= Gebhardt |first3=  K |last3= Hartnegg, | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 24–9 | url = http://www.lookingforlearning.com/abstracts/ovd39-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyscalculia often looks different at different ages. It tends to become more apparent as kids get older; however, symptoms can appear as early as preschool.&lt;ref&gt;Team, T. U. (n.d.). Understanding Dyscalculia. Retrieved September 02, 2017, from https://www.understood.org/en/learning-attention-issues/child-learning-disabilities/dyscalculia/understanding-dyscalculia&lt;/ref&gt;Common symptoms of dyscalculia are, having difficulty with mental math, trouble analyzing time and reading an analog clock, struggle with motor sequencing that involves numbers, and often they will count on their fingers when adding numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.additudemag.com/dyscalculia-in-adults-symptoms-signs-and-statistics/|title=What Does Dyscalculia Look Like in Adults?|date=2017-02-15|work=ADDitude|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persistence in children===
Although many researchers believe dyscalculia to be a persistent disorder, evidence on the persistence of dyscalculia remains mixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kucian|last2=von Aster|title=Developmental Dyscalculia|journal=European Journal of Pediatrics|date=2015|volume=174|issue=1|pages=1–13|doi=10.1007/s00431-014-2455-7|pmid=25529864}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in a study done by Mazzocco and Myers (2003), researchers evaluated children on a slew of measures and selected their most consistent measure as their best diagnostic criterion: a stringent 10th-percentile cut-off on the TEMA-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mozzocco|last2=Myers|title=Complexities in identifying and defining mathematics learning disability in the primary school-age years|journal=Annals of Dyslexia|date=2003|volume=53|issue=1|pages=218–253|doi=10.1007/s11881-003-0011-7|pmid=19750132|pmc=2742419}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with their best criterion, they found dyscalculia diagnoses for children longitudinally did not persist; only 65% of students who were ever diagnosed over the course of four years were diagnosed for at least two years. The percentage of children who were diagnosed in two consecutive years was further reduced. It is unclear whether this was the result of misdiagnosed children improving in mathematics and spatial awareness as they progressed as normal, or that the subjects who showed improvement were accurately diagnosed, but exhibited signs of a non-persistent learning disability. 

=== Persistence in adults ===
There are very few studies about adults with dyscalculia that have had a history of it growing up, but these studies have shown that it can persist into adulthood. It can affect major parts of an adult's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Attout, Salmon, Majerus|first=Lucie, Eric, Steve|date=2015|title=Working Memory for Serial Order Is Dysfunctional in Adults With a History of Developmental Dyscalculia: Evidence From Behavioral and Neuroimaging Data|url=|journal=Developmental Neuropychology|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Most adults with dyscalculia have a hard time processing math at a 4th grade level. For 1st-4th grade level, many adults will know what to do for the math problem, but they will often get them wrong because of "careless errors," although they are not careless when it comes to the problem. The adults cannot process their errors on the math problems or may not even recognize that they have made these errors. Visual-spatial input, auditory input, and touch input will be affected due to these processing errors. Dyscalculics may have a difficult time adding numbers in a column format because their mind can mix up the numbers, and it is possible that they may get the same answer twice due to their mind processing the problem incorrectly. Dyscalculics can have problems determining differences in different coins and their size or giving the correct amount of change and if numbers are grouped together, it is possible that they cannot determine which has less or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dyscalculia.org/college-dyscalculia|title=College &amp; Dyscalculia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a dyscalculic is asked to choose the greater of two numbers, with the lesser number in a larger font than the greater number, they may take the question literally and pick the number with the bigger font.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Callaway|first=Ewen|date=2013-01-09|title=Dyscalculia: Number games|url=https://www.nature.com/news/dyscalculia-number-games-1.12153|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=493|issue=7431|pages=150–153|doi=10.1038/493150a|issn=0028-0836|bibcode=2013Natur.493..150C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults with dyscalculia have a tough time with directions while driving and with controlling their finances, which causes difficulties on a day-to-day basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.additudemag.com/dyscalculia-in-adults-symptoms-signs-and-statistics/|title=What Does Dyscalculia Look Like in Adults?|last=Frye|first=Devon|date=2017-02-15|work=ADDitude|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====College students or other adult learners====
College students particularly may have a tougher time due to the fast pace and change in difficulty of the work they are given. As a result of this, students may develop a lot of anxiety and frustration. After dealing with their anxiety for a long time, students can become averse to math and try to avoid it as much as possible, which may result in lower grades in math courses. However, students with dyscalculia often do exceptionally in writing, reading, and speaking. Students may try to succeed through determination and persistence because of their inability to do well with numbers. They may try to keep a positive attitude even with the frustration and anxiety because they want to meet their goal in life. The problem, when it comes to college, is that professors cannot grade entirely on their persistence, determination, and efforts. Students need to figure out ways to overcome their difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dyscalculia.org/college-dyscalculia|title=College &amp; Dyscalculia - Dyscalculia.org|website=www.dyscalculia.org|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a lot of services that schools can provide for students. In the 21st century there is evidence that there will be an increase in enrollment for students with learning disabilities in community colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning Disabilities and Employment|last=Rapp|first=Rhonda|publisher=pro-ed|year=1997|isbn=0-89079-717-X|editor-last=Gerber|editor-first=Paul|location=Austin, Texas|pages=104|chapter=Community College Programs: Their Role in Preparing Students with Learning Disabilities for Employment|editor-last2=Brown|editor-first2=Dale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Both [[domain-general]] and [[domain-specific]] causes have been put forth. With respect to pure developmental dyscalculia, domain-general causes are unlikely as they should not impair one’s ability in the numerical domain without also affecting other domains such as reading.

Two competing domain-specific hypotheses about the causes of developmental dyscalculia have been proposed – the ''magnitude representation'' (or ''number module deficit hypothesis'') and the ''access deficit hypothesis''.

===Magnitude representation deficit===
Dehaene's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dehaene|first1=S.|title=Precis of the number sense|journal=Mind &amp; Language|date=2001|volume=16|issue=1|pages=16–36|doi=10.1111/1468-0017.00154}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[number sense]]" theory suggests that approximate numerosities are automatically ordered in an ascending manner on a mental number line. The mechanism to represent and process non-symbolic magnitude (e.g., number of dots) is often known as the "[[approximate number system]]" (ANS), and a core deficit in the precision of the ANS, known as the "magnitude representation hypothesis" or "number module deficit hypothesis", has been proposed as an underlying cause of developmental dyscalculia.&lt;ref&gt;Butterworth, B. (2005). Developmental dyscalculia. In J. I. D., Campbell (Ed.), Handbook of mathematical cognition (pp. 455–467). Hove, UK: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In particular, the structural features of the ANS is theoretically supported by a phenomenon called the "numerical distance effect", which has been robustly observed in numerical comparison tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moyer|first1=R. S.|last2=Landauer|first2=T. K.|title=Time required for judgements of numerical inequality|journal=Nature|date=1967|volume=215|issue=5109|pages=1519–1520|doi=10.1038/2151519a0|pmid=6052760|bibcode=1967Natur.215.1519M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically developing individuals are less accurate and slower in comparing pairs of numbers closer together (e.g., 7 and 8) than further apart (e.g., 2 and 9). A related "numerical ratio effect" (in which the ratio between two numbers varies but the distance is kept constant, e.g., 2 vs. 5 and 4 vs. 7) based on the [[Weber–Fechner law|Weber's law]] has also been used to further support the structure of the ANS.&lt;ref name=Halberda2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halberda|first1=J.|last2=Mazzocco|first2=M. M. M.|last3=Feigenson|first3=L.|title=Individual differences in non-verbal number acuity correlate with maths achievement|journal=Nature|date=2008|volume=455|issue=7213|pages=665–668|doi=10.1038/nature07246|pmid=18776888|bibcode=2008Natur.455..665H}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numerical ratio effect is observed when individuals are less accurate and slower in comparing pairs of numbers that have a larger ratio (e.g., 8 and 9, ratio = 8/9) than a smaller ratio (2 and 3; ratio = 2/3). A larger numerical distance or ratio effect with comparison of sets of objects (i.e., non-symbolic) is thought to reflect a less precise ANS, and the ANS acuity has been found to correlate with math achievement in typically developing children &lt;ref name=Halberda2008 /&gt; and also in adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halberda|first1=J.|last2=Ly|first2=R.|last3=Wilmer|first3=J. B.|last4=Naiman|first4=D. Q.|last5=Germine|first5=L.|title=Number sense across the lifespan as revealed by a massive Internet-based sample|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=2012|volume=109|issue=28|pages=11116–11120|doi=10.1073/pnas.1200196109|bibcode=2012PNAS..10911116H|pmid=22733748|pmc=3396479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More importantly, several behavioral studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ashkenazi|first1=S.|last2=Mark-Zigdon|first2=N.|last3=Henik|first3=A.|title=Numerical distance effect in developmental dyscalculia|journal=Cognitive Development|date=2009|volume=24|issue=4|pages=387–400|doi=10.1016/j.cogdev.2009.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mussolin|first1=C.|last2=Mejias|first2=S.|last3=Noël|first3=M. P.|title=Symbolic and nonsymbolic number comparison in children with and without dyscalculia|journal=Cognition|date=2010|volume=115|issue=1|pages=10–25|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2009.10.006|pmid=20149355}}&lt;/ref&gt; have found that children with developmental dyscalculia show an attenuated distance/ratio effect than typically developing children. Moreover, neuroimaging studies have also provided additional insights even when behavioral difference in distance/ratio effect might not be clearly evident. For example, Price and colleagues&lt;ref name=Price2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Price|first1=G. R.|last2=Holloway|first2=I.|last3=Räsänen|first3=P.|last4=Vesterinen|first4=M.|last5=Ansari|first5=D.|title=Impaired parietal magnitude processing in developmental dyscalculia|journal=Current Biology|date=2007|volume=17|issue=24|pages=1042–1043|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.10.013|pmid=18088583}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that children with developmental dyscalculia showed no differential distance effect on reaction time relative to typically developing children, but they did show a greater effect of distance on response accuracy. They also found that the right [[intraparietal sulcus]] in children with developmental dyscalculia was not modulated to the same extent in response to non-symbolic numerical processing as in typically developing children.&lt;ref name=Price2007 /&gt; With the robust implication of the intraparietal sulcus in magnitude representation, it is possible that children with developmental dyscalculia have a weak magnitude representation in the parietal region. Yet, it does not rule out an impaired ability to access and manipulate numerical quantities from their symbolic representations (e.g., Arabic digits).
[[File:Gray726 parietal lobe.png|thumb|This shows the part of the brain where the sulcus is located in the parietal lobe.]]
Moreover, findings from a cross-sectional study suggest that children with developmental dyscalculia might have a delayed development in their numerical magnitude representation by as much as five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piazza|first1=M.|last2=Facoetti|first2=A.|last3=Trussardi|first3=A.

===Access deficit hypothesis===

==Diagnosis==
At its most basic level, dyscalculia is a learning disability affecting the normal development of arithmetic skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shalev|first1=Ruth|title=Developmental Dyscalculia|journal=Journal of Child Neurology|date=2004|volume=49|issue=11|pages=868–873|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8749.2007.00868.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A consensus has not yet been reached on appropriate diagnostic criteria for dyscalculia.&lt;ref name="Berch"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berch, Mozacco|title=Why Is Math So Hard for Some Children? The Nature and Origins of Mathematical Learning Difficulties and Disabilities|journal=Brookes Publishing Company|date=2007|pages=416|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED494995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematics is a specific domain that is complex (i.e. includes many different processes, such as arithmetic, algebra, word problems, geometry, etc.) and cumulative (i.e. the processes build on each other such that mastery of an advanced skill requires mastery of many basic skills). Thus dyscalculia can be diagnosed using different criteria, and frequently is; this variety in diagnostic criteria leads to variability in identified samples, and thus variability in research findings regarding dyscalculia.
[[File:Examples of the numerical stroop effect trials.jpg|thumb|305x305px|It show the example of each condition in the numerical stroop effect task]]
Other than using achievement tests as diagnostic criteria, researchers often rely on domain-specific tests (i.e. tests of working memory, executive function, inhibition, intelligence, etc.) and teacher evaluations to create a more comprehensive diagnosis. Alternatively, fMRI research has shown that the brains of the [[neurotypical]] children can be reliably distinguished from the brains of the dyscalculic children based on the activation in the prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dinkel|title=Diagnosing Developmental Dyscalculia on the Basis of Reliable Single Case FMRI Methods: Promises and Limitations|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2013|volume=8|issue=12|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0083722|bibcode = 2013PLoSO...883722D|pages=e83722|pmid=24349547|pmc=3857322}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the cost and time limitations associated with brain and neural research, these methods will likely not be incorporated into diagnostic criteria despite their effectiveness.

===Types===
Research on subtypes of dyscalculia has begun without consensus; preliminary research has focused on comorbid learning disorders as subtyping candidates. The most common comorbidity in individuals with dyscalculia is dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landerl|title=Developmental dyscalculia and basic numerical capacities: a study of 8–9-year-old students|journal=Cognition|date=2004|volume=93|issue=2|pages=99–125|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027704000149|pmid=15147931|last2=Bevan|first2=A|last3=Butterworth|first3=B|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2003.11.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most studies done with comorbid samples versus dyscalculic-only samples have shown different mechanisms at work and additive effects of comorbidity, indicating that such subtyping may not be helpful in diagnosing dyscalculia. But there is variability in results at present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landerl|title=Dyslexia and dyscalculia: Two learning disorders with different cognitive profiles|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|date=2009|volume=103|issue=3|pages=309–324|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022096509000575|pmid=19398112|last2=Fussenegger|first2=B|last3=Moll|first3=K|last4=Willburger|first4=E|doi=10.1016/j.jecp.2009.03.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rouselle|last2=Noël|title=Basic numerical skills in children with mathematics learning disabilities: A comparison of symbolic vs non-symbolic number magnitude processing|journal=Cognition|date=2007|volume=102|issue=3|pages=361–395|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027706000229|pmid=16488405|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2006.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosselli|first1=Monica|last2=Matute|first2=Esmeralda|last3=Pinto|first3=Noemi|last4=Ardila|first4=Alfredo|title=Memory Abilities in Children With Subtypes of Dyscalculia|journal=Developmental Neuropsychology|date=2006|volume=30|issue=3|pages=801–818|doi=10.1207/s15326942dn3003_3|pmid=17083294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Semantic memory''':  This subtype often coexists with reading disabilities such as [[dyslexia]] and is characterized by poor representation and retrieval from [[long-term memory]].  These processes share a common neural pathway in the left [[angular gyrus]], which has been shown to be selective in arithmetic fact retrieval strategies&lt;ref name=GrabnerEtal09&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grabner|first1=RH|last2=Ansari|first2=D|last3=Koschutnig|first3=K|last4=Reishofer|first4=G|last5=Ebner|first5=F|last6=Neuper|first6=C|title=To retrieve or to calculate?

This has been observed in individuals with [[Gerstmann syndrome]], of which dyscalculia is one of constellation of symptoms.
* '''Procedural concepts''':  Research by Geary has shown that in addition to increased problems with fact retrieval, children with math disabilities may rely on immature computational strategies.  Specifically, children with mathematical disabilities showed poor command of counting strategies unrelated to their ability to retrieve numeric facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geary|first1=DC|title=A componential analysis of an early learning deficit in mathematics|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|date=1990|volume=49|issue=3|pages=363383|doi=10.1016/0022-0965(90)90065-G}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This research notes that it is difficult to discern whether poor conceptual knowledge is indicative of a qualitative deficit in number processing or simply a delay in typical mathematical development.
* '''Working memory''':  Studies have found that children with dyscalculia showed impaired performance on [[working memory]] tasks compared to neurotypical children.&lt;ref name=McLeanHitch99&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McLean|first1=JF|last2=Hitch|first2=GJ|title=Working Memory Impairments in Children with Specific Arithmetic Learning Difficulties|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|date=1999|volume=74|issue=3|pages=240–260|doi=10.1006/jecp.1999.2516|pmid=10527556}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SzucsEtal13&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Szucs|first1=D|last2=Devine|first2=A|last3=Soltesz|first3=F|last4=Nobes|first4=A|last5=Gabriel|first5=F|title=Developmental dyscalculia is related to visuo-spatial memory and inhibition impairment|journal=Cortex|date=2013|volume=49|issue=10|pages=2674–2688|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2013.06.007|pmid=23890692|pmc=3878850}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, research has shown that children with dyscalculia have weaker activation of the [[intraparietal sulcus]] during visuospatial working memory tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rotzer|first1=S|last2=Loenneker|first2=T|last3=Kucian|first3=K|last4=Martin|first4=E|last5=Klaver|first5=P|last6=von Aster|first6=M|title=Dysfunctional neural network of spatial working memory contributes to developmental dyscalculia|journal=Neuropsychologia|date=2009|volume=47|issue=13|pages=2859–2865|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.06.009|pmid=19540861}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brain activity in this region during such tasks has been linked to overall arithmetic performance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dumontheil|first1=I|last2=Klingberg|first2=T|title=Brain Activity during a Visuospatial Working Memory Task Predicts Arithmetical Performance 2 Years Later|journal=Cerebral Cortex|date=2012|volume=22|issue=5|pages=1078–1085|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhr175|pmid=21768226}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that numerical and working memory functions may converge in the intraparietal sulcus.  However, working memory problems are confounded with domain-general learning difficulties, thus these deficits may not be specific to dyscalculia but rather may reflect a greater learning deficit.  Dysfunction in prefrontal regions may also lead to deficits in working memory and other executive function, accounting for comorbidity with ADHD.&lt;ref name=Shalev /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rubinsten2009 /&gt;
 
Studies have also shown indications of causes due to [[congenital]] or [[hereditary disorder]]s,&lt;ref name="pmid15727331"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Monuteaux |first1= MC |last2= Faraone |first2= SV |last3= Herzig |first3= K |last4= Navsaria |first4= N |last5= Biederman |first5= J |displayauthors= 4 |title=ADHD and dyscalculia: Evidence for independent familial transmission |journal=J Learn Disabil |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=86–93 |year=2005 |pmid=15727331 |doi= 10.1177/00222194050380010701|url=http://ldx.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15727331}}&lt;/ref&gt; but evidence of this is not yet concrete.

As such, instruction time in the classroom is necessarily limited. For this reason, several research groups have developed computer adaptive training programs designed to target deficits unique to dyscalculic individuals.

Several digital interventions have been developed for dyscalculics specifically. Each attempts to target basic processes that are associated with maths difficulties. Rescue Calcularis was one early computerized intervention that sought to improve the integrity of and access to the mental number line.&lt;ref name="Kucian, K. 2011"/&gt; Other digital interventions for dyscalculia adapt games, flash cards, and manipulables to function through technology.&lt;ref name="Butterworth, B. 2010"/&gt;

While each intervention claims to improve basic numerosity skills, the authors of these interventions do admit that repetition and practice effects may be a factor involved in reported performance gains.&lt;ref name="Butterworth, B. 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kucian, K. 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Räsänen, P."/&gt; An additional criticism is that these digital interventions lack the option to manipulate numerical quantities.&lt;ref name="Butterworth, B. 2011"/&gt; While the previous two games provide the correct answer, the individual using the intervention cannot actively determine, through manipulation, what the correct answer should be. Butterworth and colleagues argued that games like The Number Bonds, which allows an individual to compare different sized rods, should be the direction that digital interventions move towards. Such games use manipulation activities to provide intrinsic motivation towards content guided by dyscalculia research. One of these [[serious game]]s is [[Meister Cody – Talasia]], an online training that includes the [[CODY Assessment]] – a diagnostic test for detecting dyscalculia.

==Etymology==
The term ''dyscalculia'' dates back to at least 1949.&lt;ref name="Pollak2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Trott |first=Clare |editor-first=David |editor-last= Pollak|title=Neurodiversity in Higher Education: Positive Responses to Specific Learning Differences |chapter=Dyscalculia|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eVhQoqboi1UC&amp;pg=PA125 |date=5 March 2009|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-470-99753-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kosc, Ladislav|year=1974|url=http://ldx.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/7/3/164|title=Developmental dyscalculia|journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities|volume=7|number=3|pages=159–62|doi=10.1177/002221947400700309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyscalculia comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] and means "counting badly". The prefix "''dys-''" comes from Greek and means "badly". The root "''calculia''" comes from the Latin "''calculare''", which means "[[counting|to count]]" and which is also related to "[[calculation]]" and "[[calculus]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7117">An '''ecological vegetation class''' (EVC) is a component of the [[vegetation classification]] system developed and used by the state of Victoria, Australia, since 1994, for mapping floristic biodiversity. Ecological vegetation classes are groupings of [[vegetation]] communities based on floristic, structural, and [[ecological]] features. The [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]n [[Government of Victoria (Australia)#Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE)|Department of Sustainability and Environment]] has defined all of the EVCs within Victoria.

An EVC consists of one or a number of floristic communities that appear to be associated with a recognisable [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]] niche, and which can be characterised by a number of their adaptive responses to ecological processes that operate at the landscape scale level. Each ecological vegetation class is described through a combination of its floristic, life-form, and reproductive strategy profiles, and through an inferred fidelity to particular environmental attributes.&lt;ref name="evc_benchmarks"&gt;[http://www.dse.vic.gov.au/conservation-and-environment/native-vegetation-groups-for-victoria/ecological-vegetation-class-evc-benchmarks-by-bioregion DSE Website-EVC Benchmarks for each Bioregion]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are many hundreds of individual EVCs, some can be grouped together to form a "bioregion", which is a landscape-scale approach to classifying the environment using a range of attributes such as climate, geomorphology, geology, soils and vegetation.  There are 28 bioregions across [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].&lt;ref name="evc_benchmarks" /&gt;  Each EVC within a biogregion can be assigned a [[conservation status]], to indicate its degree of alteration since European settlement in Australia.  To assist with the assessment of an EVC within a bioregion, benchmarks have been established to ensure that assessments are carried out in a standard fashion across Victoria.

==Development==
Ecological vegetation classes developed from earlier approaches to the mapping of floristic communities. An example in Victoria of such earlier mapping was that done for the Otway Forest Management Area by Brinkman and Farell in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brinkman|first1=R|last2=Farrell|first2=S|title=Statement of resources, uses &amp; values for the Otway Forest Management Area|date=1990|publisher=Department of Conservation and Environment|location=East Melbourne|isbn=073060604X|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/version/6929412}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represented a break from previous floristic mapping, which was based on structural vegetation units, which in turn were derived from assessing height, density and species composition of the canopy. A "structural vegetation unit" approach had been used for the Land Conservation Council (LCC) Study Area vegetation mapping in Victoria in the 1970s (see e.g. LCC 1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Report on the Corangamite study area|date=1976|publisher=Land Conservation Council, Victoria|location=Melbourne|isbn=0724110569|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/version/10985083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first implementation of EVCs was by Woodgate et al. (1994) for mapping of East Gippsland old growth forests, under the Victorian Department of Natural Resources and Environment. In actuality, two mapping exercises were undertaken. One was for "extant EVCs" showing vegetation at the time of mapping (i.e. the 1990s), and the other "pre-1750 EVCs", which mapped an expert interpretation of the vegetation classes as they would have been prior to European impact, taken nominally as the year 1750.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodgate|first1=P.W.|last2=Peel|first2=W.D.|last3=Ritman|first3=K.T.|last4=Coram|first4=J.E.|last5=Brady|first5=A.|last6=Rule|first6=A.J.|last7=Banks|first7=J.C.G.|title=A Study of the old-growth forests of East Gippsland|publisher=Victoria: Department of Conservation and Natural Resources|location=East Melbourne|isbn=0730648036|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/version/13050492}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1996 an expert scientific group was established to undertake a peer review of the EVC methodology, concluding that "EVCs provide an important statewide level of vegetation mapping and that EVCs are an appropriate basis for assessing floristic biodiversity conservation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Victoria. Department of Natural Resources and Environment|last2=Joint Commonwealth and Victorian Regional Forest Agreement Steering Committee|title=Comprehensive regional assessment East Gippsland : environment and heritage report|date=1996|publisher=Department of Natural Resources and Environment|location=East Melbourne|isbn=0642254583|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/version/17070100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecological vegetation class mapping was implemented under the Comprehensive Regional Assessment reporting for the five Regional Forest Agreements that were underway in Victoria in the late 1990s. For an example of this mapping, see the "Comprehensive Regional Assessment" and the "Biodiversity Assessment Report" for the West Victorian Regional Forest Agreement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Victorian Regional Forest Agreement|url=http://www.agriculture.gov.au/forestry/policies/rfa/regions/vic-west|publisher=Australian Government. Department of Agriculture|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in particular for this example see [http://www.agriculture.gov.au/SiteCollectionImages/rfa/regions/vic-west/regional-assessment/volume-1/map2.gif Map 2: 'Extant Ecological Vegetation Classes'] and [http://www.agriculture.gov.au/SiteCollectionImages/rfa/regions/vic-west/regional-assessment/volume-1/map3.gif Map 3: 'Ecological Vegetation Classes - Pre-1750 Extent'], for the western part of the West Victorian RFA area. Through the RFA process and subsequent mapping projects in the non-productive forest regions of the state, the whole of the state of Victoria was mapped with EVCs at 1:100,000 scale.

Ecological vegetation class mapping has become an important tool for biodiversity planning and management in the State of Victoria. The mapping itself has been released to the public in a number of formats. The [http://mapshare2.dse.vic.gov.au/MapShare2EXT/imf.jsp?site=bim Biodiversity Interactive Map] on the [http://vro.depi.vic.gov.au/dpi/vro/vrosite.nsf/pages/vrohome DEPI website] allows users to display a number of vegetation themes for any area of Victoria - including ecological vegetation classes (EVCs), 1750 EVCs, broad EVC groups and the bioregional conservation status of EVCs. Users can print out interactive maps that they have created. The department has a downloadable information sheet [http://www.dse.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/97323/NV_spatial_datasets.pdf 'Overview of native vegetation spatial datasets'] explaining the EVC spatial data products. Recently, the Victorian government has publicly released the EVC spatial datasets in various GIS vector data formats on the [https://www.data.vic.gov.au/home Victorian Government Data Directory] under a creative commons licence.

The '''emulation theory of representation''' postulates that there are multiple internal modeling circuitries in the brain referred to as emulators. These emulators mimic the input-output patterns of many cognitive operations including action, perception, and imagery.&lt;ref name="Grush 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Grush |first=R. |year=2004 |title=The emulation theory of representation: Motor control, imagery, and perception |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=27 |pages=377–422 |doi=10.1017/s0140525x04000093}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bickle"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bickle |first=J. |year=2009 |title=The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy and Neuroscience |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often running in parallel, these emulators provide resultant feedback in the form of mock sensory signals of a motor command with less delay than sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Desmurget |first1=M. |last2=Grafton |first2=S. |year=2000 |title=Forward modeling allows feedback control for fast reaching movements |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=4 |pages=423–431 |doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(00)01537-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These forward models receive efference copies of input motor commands being sent to the body and the resulting output sensory signals. Emulators are continually updating so as to give the most accurate anticipatory signal following motor inputs.&lt;ref name="Grush 2004"/&gt;

== Mechanics and structure ==
Little is known about the overall structure of emulators. It could operate like a search glossary with a very large associative memory of input-output sequences. Under this system, the emulator receives a motor command input, finds the closest matching input from its database, and then sends the associated output in that sequence. The other model is an articulated emulator. This model requires that for each significant sensor of the [[human musculoskeletal system]] there is a group of neurons with a parallel firing frequency within the emulator.&lt;ref name="Grush 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kawato"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kawato |first1=M. |last2=Furukawa |first2=K. |last3=Suzuki |first3=R. |year=1987 |title=A Hierarchical Neural-Network Model for Control and Learning of Voluntary Movement |journal=Biological Cybernetics |volume=57 |pages=169–185 |doi=10.1007/bf00364149}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups of neurons would receive the same input as that being sent to their corresponding part of the musculoskeletal system. For example, when raising one’s hand signals will be sent to neurons responsible for wrist, elbow, and shoulder angles and arm angular inertia.

Regardless of this structure both systems will grow and change over time. This is due to constant, fluctuating noise from the environment and the fact that the body changes over time. Growing limbs and muscles result in changes in both required input commands and the resulting output. This requires a degree of plasticity in the emulators. Emulators are thus continually updating, always receiving the resulting output from the musculoskeletal system from an inputted command and comparing it to its own output. It is likely that this is accomplished through [[Kalman Filter]]. Complete correction from the difference in outputs, however, is not applied to the emulators.

[[File:Basic concept of Kalman filtering.svg|800x405px|thumbnail|center|Basic Concept of a Kalman Filter]]

Noise is a constant, fluctuating variable affecting musculoskeletal sensory output. Thus, output differences are almost always greater than they actually should be. Consequently, an internal calculation is made; taking into account the relative reliability of the emulator’s output and if the situational conditions tend to result in very variable or stable sensory outputs, the correction is weighted and applied.&lt;ref name="Grush 2004"/&gt;

The location of these emulators have been found to be largely dependent on the motor system they provide processing and information for.

== Cognitive function ==
Emulators are helpful tools to the body. Sensory feedback naturally takes longer than a predetermined forward model that the brain can compute or access directly. This timing gap can be delayed further by other environmental or physical factors that often occur throughout life. Emulators allow a mock output signal that is often close to that of the real thing. It is further postulated that the emulator can be run independently thus allowing the brain see the likely outcome of a command without running it on the entire system. Furthermore, when returning sensory information has noise and\or holes, the emulator can be run in parallel, making corrections and filling in gaps.&lt;ref name="Bickle 2009"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bickle |first=John |year=2009 |title=The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy and Neuroscience |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motor control ===
Experiments have found that the temporal length of the motor control loop takes approximately 250-400 ms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ito |first=M. |year=1984 |title=The cerebellum and neural control |location=New York, NY |publisher=Raven Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motor centers, however, are already making corrections to their previous motor plan about 70 ms after the onset of the movement based on peripheral information that should not have arrived yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=van der Meulen |first1=J.H.P. |last2=Gooskens |first2=R.H.J.M. |last3=Dennier van der Gon |first3=J.J. |last4=Gielen |first4=C.C.A.M. |last5=Wilhelm |first5=K. |year=1990 |title=Mechanisms Underlying Accuracy in Fast Goal-Directed Arm Movements in Man |journal=Journal of Motor Behavior |volume=22 |number=1 |pages=67–84 |doi=10.1080/00222895.1990.10735502}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus likely that there are motor emulators that receive and process efferent copies and then send predictive peripheral output before the actual peripheral output from sensors is received. Motor centers often have to run very quickly. Feedback delays and peripheral errors make real-time, rapid motor movement very difficult and liable to failure. Through the use of emulators motor centers can receive fast and reliable feedback in the form of a priori predictions. The later real periphery output can then be incorporated into a more accurate model.&lt;ref name="Bickle 2009"/&gt;

=== Motor imagery ===
It is possible that emulators are largely responsible for [[motor imagery]]. By running motor areas offline, emulators can receive hypothetical movement commands and provide the imagined likely sensory results. Much of this may be run without conscious awareness. For instance, when walking towards an object on the ground to grab it, the brain is running offline motor plans to determine the optimal hand positioning and grip strength to pick up the object.&lt;ref name="Bickle 2009"/&gt;

=== Visual system ===
Visual modal specific emulators have been experimentally shown to exist in an experiment by Ernst Mach in 1896. In his experiment, the subjects’ eyes were prevented from moving and then they were exposed to a stimulus that would trigger a saccade. Most subjects reported experiencing their entire visual scene briefly being shift in the opposite direction of the stimulus. Mach thus inferred that there is a mechanism within the visual system producing an a priori estimate of future visual scenes based upon motor commands and current visual stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mach |first=E. |year=1896 |title=Contributions to the Analysis of the Sensations |translator= C. M. WIlliams |location=La Salle |publisher=Open Court Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar experiment on monkeys, this particular emulator was found to exist within a group of neurons within parietal cortex. Furthermore, it was discovered that these neurons began firing before the eye even moved. They only fired, however, if the motor command would result in a visual saccade. This suggests that visual emulators are modally specific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Duhamel |first1=J. |last2=Colby |first2=C. |last3=Goldberg |first3=M. |year=1992 |title=The Updating of the Representation of Visual Space in Parietal Cortex by Intended Eye Movements |journal=Science |volume=255 |pages=90–92 |doi=10.1126/science.1553535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications for emulators ==
Emulators can be useful in a variety of industries and systems. Many factories and plants have central control systems that cannot afford to wait for certain information or updates. For example, control systems in chemical plants and reactors cannot wait for correctional signals from target systems to make alterations to chemical and material distribution and flow, thus accurate a priori predictions are made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Clark |first=A. |year=2003 |title=Natural-Born Cyborgs: Minds, Technologies, and the Future of Human Intelligence |location=New York |publisher=Oxford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robotics ===
Emulator-like programming has already been applied to many [[Artificial intelligence|AI]]. systems. In 1988 [[Bartlett Mel]] created a robot he named Murphy. Murphy was a robot arm with three joints and whose main objective was to reach out and grasp an object while avoiding contact with several objects in the way. The robot could operate under two modes. Under the first mode, Murphy would simply move its arm around the workspace until it found a path of unobstructed movement to the intended object. After enough of these runs, Murphy learns to associate a motor command with a future visual output. This leads to its second mode of operation. Similar to an emulator, Murphy can solve the navigation problem offline. Receiving visual imagery of the workspace, Murphy can manipulate an internal visual grid with [[efference copy|efference copies]]. Consequently, the robot can navigate through the obstacles and grasp the intended object in only one run.&lt;ref name="Grush 2004"/&gt;

The [[Mars landing]] rovers have to utilize a similar manipulation of input. [[NASA]] has to overcome an approximately twenty-minute time delay in information exchange from Earth and the rover on Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

'''Franklin University Switzerland''' is a [[Private school|private]] [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts university]] in [[Lugano]], [[Switzerland]]. Founded in 1969, Franklin offers [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Master of Science]] degrees accredited by both in Switzerland and in the United States. Prospective American students can apply to Franklin University Switzerland through the [[Common Application]].

==History==
Chartered in 1969, Franklin University Switzerland was born out of the former Fleming College and founded as a non-profit, independent, post-secondary institution under the name of Franklin University Switzerland. The institution is named for [[Benjamin Franklin]], the [[United States]]' first ambassador to [[France]]. It has stressed, since its incarnation, the importance of international studies as the basis for a strong, global education.

Franklin University Switzerland obtained United States accreditation from the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in 1975, confirmed most recently in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.msche.org/institutions_view.asp?idinstitution=232|title=Middle States Commission on Higher Education|author=Info724 Ltd.|publisher=|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having obtained Swiss program-level accreditation in 2005, Franklin was granted full university institution accreditation by the Swiss University Conference in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cus.ch/wDeutsch/akkreditierung/studiengaenge/index.php|title=Schweizerische Universitätskonferenz - Akkreditierte Studiengänge und Institutionen|author=author|publisher=|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the only university in the world to be accredited in the United States and Switzerland. Swiss accreditation as a university institution gave Franklin the right to call itself a university in Switzerland. In April 2014, the institution officially changed its name and celebrated its inauguration as Franklin University Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fus.edu/about-franklin/news/907-franklin-celebrates-university-day|title=Franklin Celebrates University Day|publisher=|accessdate=12 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141120222658/http://www.fus.edu/about-franklin/news/907-franklin-celebrates-university-day|archivedate=20 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
[[Image:Franklin College Switzerland Main Lawn 2007.jpg|thumb|Franklin University Switzerland, the main campus]]
The main campus (known as Kaletsch Campus), acquired in 1985, is composed of a private villa with attached library, auditorium, and classroom wing, surrounded by a wooded park. In 2005 the university acquired an additional campus nearby (known as North Campus), adding administrative, education, athletic, social and residential capacity. The current campus spans {{convert|5|acre|ha|order=flip|0}}. The Franklin campus is residential, and is on a hillside overlooking the town of [[Lugano]], in the Italian-speaking canton of [[Ticino]], [[Switzerland]].

[[Image:Franklin College Residenza Panera.jpg|thumb|Franklin University Switzerland, Residenza Panera]]

Franklin University Switzerland has nine residence buildings, seven in [[Sorengo]] and two in [[Lugano]].
* Airone is in an old hotel directly between the main campus and North Campus with singles and doubles. All rooms have their own bathrooms and some of which have kitchenettes. The ground floor houses the office of Student Life, and one of the student lounges, the "Falcon's Nest".
* Alba is in Lugano 5–10 minutes from North Campus on the way downtown.
* Ciliegi is directly across via Ponte Tresa from Airone. This is the smallest residence on campus, in apartment-style doubles.
* Leonardo da Vinci (LDV) is on the grounds of North Campus; this is the only all-freshman student dormitory.
* Giardino, nestled below the Sorengo monastery: This residence is mainly multiples (4-6 bedrooms and a shared kitchen) with some triples for freshmen.
* Panera is on the main campus grounds next to the Grotto (one of two dining halls) with apartment-style triples. Each apartment consists of four rooms: a bedroom, bathroom (with bathtub), separate kitchen, and a large common room with three desks and a couch. The Panera Lawn is a common meeting place and hang out for many students, no matter what residence they live in.
* The final two buildings are the as-of-late unnamed New Buildings (A and B) located across via Ponte Tresa from Panera. New Building A has four bedroom apartment-style housing, while New Building B has two, three, four, five, and six bedroom apartments, some of which are two stories. All rooms in both New Buildings have arguably the biggest kitchens on campus with at least one bathroom (with a shower) per two students. New Building B offers a noise-free, substance-free rooming option with an emphasis on healthy living for students.

==Academics==
Franklin's curriculum promotes international awareness and critical thinking, and emphasizes an interdisciplinary and liberal arts perspective. The majority of courses are taught in English, with the exception of language courses, including an upper-level language courses on film, culture and literature. Students must achieve proficiency in Italian, French, Spanish, or German, through fulfilling a three-year language course sequence.

In addition to the language requirement, a core curriculum consisting of Intercultural Competencies (humanities and arts), International Engagement (political science, history and economics) and Social Responsibility (sciences and cultural studies) is at the forefront. A full year's worth of study in these three categories is a requirement. Courses in mathematics and writing are required as well.

The most popular majors at Franklin are International Management, International Relations, Environmental Studies, Communications and Media Studies and International Economics, respectively.&lt;ref name="usnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/franklin-college-switzerland-CH0001|title=Franklin University Switzerland|work=Best Colleges|publisher=U.S. News and World Report|accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average class size at Franklin is 16, with no class exceeding 30 students.

==Academic Travel Program==
The Academic Travel Program is an integrated part of the Franklin University Switzerland curriculum. Academic Travel is a credit-bearing degree requirement, and two weeks of travel each semester represent an extension of the students’ class work.&lt;ref name="ga"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goabroad.com/providers/franklin-college-switzerland/programs/franklin-a-us-college-in-switzerland-4605|title=Franklin - A US College in Switzerland|work=Degree Abroad|publisher=GoAbroad|accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Travel is led by faculty members and relates to the academic expertise of the individual professor and to his or her knowledge of a given country or area.

All students, including semester and year-abroad students, are required to participate in the Academic Travel Program. Academic Travel is a graduation requirement and an integral component of each semester of study. The graduation requirement for Academic Travel is fulfilled by participating in six travel programs. Students usually fulfill the requirement by participating each semester of their first three years at Franklin. Students who enter with sophomore standing must participate each semester in which they are enrolled except their senior year.

The travels are themed around academic studies relating to the location visited and the professor guiding the travel. Economics, art history, literature, business and marketing, international relations, and history are among common themes investigated through travels.

Academic Travel destinations have included the [[Baltic states]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Denmark]], [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Guatemala]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Iceland]], [[India]], [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Malawi]], [[Morocco]], [[Mozambique]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Scotland]], [[Serbia]], [[South Korea]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[Turkey]], and the [[United States]].

==Student life==
Student life at Franklin consists of an emphasis on independent travel in [[Switzerland]] and greater [[Europe]], and of student associations, residential life, and interaction with Swiss-Italian culture in Lugano.

==Athletics==
Franklin University Switzerland offers students a wide variety of sports and fitness programs, as well as activities to promote a healthy lifestyle. Some on-campus sports facilities include the Tone Athletic Center, two volleyball courts, a basketball court and a soccer field.  Organized athletic activities include Men's and Women's Soccer, Men's and Women's Basketball, and Lugano Street Dance. Students are also encouraged to start athletic programs. Student-led activities have included Field Hockey, Yoga, Cross-fit, and Self-Defense.

Since 2000-2001 (with an exception of a bye year in 2001-2002)  Franklin's men's soccer team has competed in the National Swiss Division (5th League). The team competes with other clubs in the league from the Canton of [[Ticino]]. Franklin University Switzerland is currently the reserve team for the local club FC Paradiso, making it Franklin FC Paradiso II. In spring 2012 the team won its fourth Fair Play award. The team trains twice a week and competes on the weekends in the fall and spring semesters — home games are played on Friday nights. The players have a mid-season break from December to February.  During this period the school hosts an indoor soccer tournament open to all Franklin students, faculty and staff.

A '''fuzzy control system''' is a [[control system]] based on [[fuzzy logic]]—a [[mathematics|mathematical]] system that analyzes [[analog signal|analog]] input values in terms of  [[mathematical logic|logic]]al variables that take on continuous values between 0 and 1, in contrast to classical or [[Digital data|digital]] logic, which operates on discrete values of either 1 or 0 (true or false, respectively).&lt;ref name = "Pedrycz"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pedrycz|first1=Witold|title=Fuzzy control and fuzzy systems|year=1993|publisher=Research Studies Press Ltd.|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hájek"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hájek|first1=Petr|title=Metamathematics of fuzzy logic|year=1998|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Fuzzy logic is widely used in machine control. The term  "fuzzy" refers to the fact that the logic involved can deal with concepts that cannot be expressed as the "true" or "false" but rather as "partially true".  Although alternative approaches such as genetic algorithms and neural networks can perform just as well as fuzzy logic in many cases, fuzzy logic has the advantage that the solution to the problem can be cast in terms that human operators can understand, so that their experience can be used in the design of the controller.  This makes it easier to mechanize tasks that are already successfully performed by humans.&lt;ref name = "Pedrycz" /&gt;

== History and applications ==
Fuzzy logic was first proposed by [[Lotfi A. Zadeh]] of the University of California at Berkeley in a 1965 paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0019-9958(65)90241-X| title = Fuzzy sets| journal = Information and Control| volume = 8| issue = 3| pages = 338–353| year = 1965| last1 = Zadeh | first1 = Lotfi A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; He elaborated on his ideas in a 1973 paper that introduced the concept of "linguistic variables", which in this article equates to a variable defined as a fuzzy set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1109/TSMC.1973.5408575| title = Outline of a new approach to the analysis of complex systems and decision processes| journal = IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics| volume = 1| pages = 28–44| year = 1973| last1 = Zadeh | first1 = Lotfi A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research followed, with the first industrial application, a cement [[kiln]] built in Denmark, coming on line in 1975.

Fuzzy systems were initially implemented in [[Japan]].

* Interest in fuzzy systems was sparked by Seiji Yasunobu and Soji Miyamoto of [[Hitachi]], who in 1985 provided simulations that demonstrated the feasibility of fuzzy control systems for the [[Sendai Subway]]. Their ideas were adopted, and fuzzy systems were used to control accelerating, braking, and stopping when the [[Sendai Subway Namboku Line|Namboku Line]] opened in 1987.
* In 1987, Takeshi Yamakawa demonstrated the use of fuzzy control, through a set of simple dedicated fuzzy logic chips, in an "[[inverted pendulum]]" experiment. This is a classic control problem, in which a vehicle tries to keep a pole mounted on its top by a hinge upright by moving back and forth. Yamakawa subsequently made the demonstration more sophisticated by mounting a wine glass containing water and even a live mouse to the top of the pendulum: the system maintained stability in both cases. Yamakawa eventually went on to organize his own fuzzy-systems research lab to help exploit his patents in the field.
* Japanese engineers subsequently developed a wide range of fuzzy systems for both industrial and consumer applications. In 1988 Japan established the Laboratory for International Fuzzy Engineering (LIFE), a cooperative arrangement between 48 companies to pursue fuzzy research. The automotive company Volkswagen was the only foreign corporate member of LIFE, dispatching a researcher for a duration of three years.
* Japanese consumer goods often incorporate fuzzy systems. Matsushita vacuum cleaners use microcontrollers running fuzzy algorithms to interrogate dust sensors and adjust [[suction power]] accordingly. Hitachi washing machines use fuzzy controllers to load-weight, fabric-mix, and dirt sensors and automatically set the wash cycle for the best use of power, water, and detergent.
* Canon developed an [[autofocus]]ing camera that uses a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) to measure the clarity of the image in six regions of its field of view and use the information provided to determine if the image is in focus. It also tracks the rate of change of lens movement during focusing, and controls its speed to prevent overshoot. The camera's fuzzy control system uses 12 inputs: 6 to obtain the current clarity data provided by the CCD and 6 to measure the rate of change of lens movement. The output is the position of the lens. The fuzzy control system uses 13 rules and requires 1.1 kilobytes of memory.
*An industrial [[air conditioner]] designed by Mitsubishi uses 25 heating rules and 25 cooling rules. A temperature sensor provides input, with control outputs fed to an [[inverter (logic gate)|inverter]], a compressor valve, and a fan motor. Compared to the previous design, the fuzzy controller heats and cools five times faster, reduces power consumption by 24%, increases temperature stability by a factor of two, and uses fewer sensors.
* Other applications investigated or implemented include: character and handwriting recognition; optical fuzzy systems; robots, including one for making Japanese flower arrangements; [[voice control|voice-controlled]] robot helicopters (hovering is a "balancing act" rather similar to the inverted pendulum problem); rehabilitation robotics to provide patient-specific solutions (e.g. to control heart rate and blood pressure &lt;ref name = "sarabadani"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/TBME.2015.2391234 |title=Real-time closed-loop control of human heart rate and blood pressure|year=2015 |last1=Sarabadani Tafreshi |first1=Amirehsan |journal=IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering|volume=62 |issue=5 |pages=1434–1442 |pmid=25594957 |last2=Klamroth-Marganska|first2=V. |last3=Nussbaumer |first3=S.|last4=Riener|first4=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;); control of flow of powders in film manufacture; elevator systems; and so on.

Work on fuzzy systems is also proceeding in the United State and Europe, although on a less extensive scale than in Japan.

* The [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] has investigated fuzzy control for [[Efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] motors, and [[NASA]] has studied fuzzy control for automated space docking: simulations show that a fuzzy control system can greatly reduce fuel consumption.
* Firms such as [[Boeing]], [[General Motors]], [[Allen-Bradley]], [[Chrysler]], [[Eaton Corporation|Eaton]], and [[Whirlpool Corporation|Whirlpool]] have worked on fuzzy logic for use in low-power refrigerators, improved automotive transmissions, and energy-efficient electric motors.
* In 1995 [[Maytag]] introduced an "intelligent" [[dishwasher]] based on a fuzzy controller and a "one-stop sensing module" that combines a [[thermistor]], for temperature measurement; a conductivity sensor, to measure detergent level from the ions present in the wash; a turbidity sensor that measures scattered and transmitted light to measure the soiling of the wash; and a magnetostrictive sensor to read spin rate. The system determines the optimum wash cycle for any load to obtain the best results with the least amount of energy, detergent, and water. It even adjusts for dried-on foods by tracking the last time the door was opened, and estimates the number of dishes by the number of times the door was opened.

Research and development is also continuing on fuzzy applications in software, as opposed to [[firmware]], design, including fuzzy [[expert system]]s and integration of fuzzy logic with [[artificial neural network|neural-network]] and so-called adaptive "[[genetic algorithm|genetic]]" software systems, with the ultimate goal of building "self-learning" fuzzy-control systems.&lt;ref name="mamdani"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mamdani|first1=Ebrahim H|title=Application of fuzzy algorithms for control of simple dynamic plant|journal=Proceedings of the Institution of Electrical Engineers|year=1974|volume=121|issue=12|pages=1585–1588|doi=10.1049/piee.1974.0328}}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems can be employed to control complex, nonlinear dynamic plants, for example, human body.&lt;ref name = "sarabadani" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "mamdani" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bastian|first1=Andreas|title=Identifying fuzzy models utilizing genetic programming|journal=Fuzzy sets and systems|year=2000|volume=113|issue=3|pages=333–350|doi=10.1016/S0165-0114(98)00086-4|url=http://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/pdf/specific/articulo/science2_27.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fuzzy sets ==
{{see also|fuzzy set}}
{{unbalanced|section|date=April 2011}}
The input variables in a fuzzy control system are in general mapped by sets of membership functions similar to this, known as "fuzzy sets". The process of converting a crisp input value to a fuzzy value is called "fuzzification".

A control system may also have various types of [[switch]], or "ON-OFF", inputs along with its analog inputs, and such switch inputs of course will always have a truth value equal to either 1 or 0, but the scheme can deal with them as simplified fuzzy functions that happen to be either one value or another.

Given "[[Map (mathematics)|mapping]]s" of input variables into membership functions and [[truth value]]s, the [[microcontroller]] then [[decision making|makes decisions]] for what action to take, based on a set of "rules", each of the form:

   IF brake temperature IS warm AND speed IS not very fast 
   THEN brake pressure IS slightly decreased.

In this example, the two input variables are "brake temperature" and "speed" that have values defined as fuzzy sets. The output variable, "brake pressure" is also defined by a fuzzy set that can have values like "static" or "slightly increased" or "slightly decreased" etc.

This rule by itself is very puzzling since it looks like it could be used without bothering with fuzzy logic, but remember that the decision is based on a set of rules:

* All the rules that apply are invoked, using the membership functions and truth values obtained from the inputs, to determine the result of the rule.
* This result in turn will be mapped into a membership function and truth value controlling the output variable.
* These results are combined to give a specific ("crisp") answer, the actual brake pressure, a procedure known as "[[defuzzification]]".

This combination of fuzzy operations and [[Rule-based system|rule-based]] "[[inference]]" describes a "fuzzy expert system".

Traditional control systems are based on mathematical models in which the control system is described using one or more [[differential equation]]s that define the system response to its inputs. Such systems are often implemented as "PID controllers" ([[PID controller|proportional-integral-derivative controllers]]). They are the products of decades of development and theoretical analysis, and are highly effective.

If PID and other traditional control systems are so well-developed, why bother with fuzzy control? It has some advantages. In many cases, the mathematical model of the control process may not exist, or may be too "expensive" in terms of computer processing power and memory, and a system based on empirical rules may be more effective.

Furthermore, fuzzy logic is well suited to low-cost implementations based on cheap sensors, low-resolution analog-to-digital converters, and 4-bit or 8-bit one-chip microcontroller chips. Such systems can be easily upgraded by adding new rules to improve performance or add new features. In many cases, fuzzy control can be used to improve existing traditional controller systems by adding an extra layer of intelligence to the current control method.

=== Fuzzy control in detail ===
Fuzzy controllers are very simple conceptually. They consist of an input stage, a processing stage, and an output stage. The input stage maps sensor or other inputs, such as switches, thumbwheels, and so on, to the appropriate membership functions and truth values. The processing stage invokes each appropriate rule and generates a result for each, then combines the results of the rules. Finally, the output stage converts the combined result back into a specific control output value.

The most common shape of membership functions is triangular, although trapezoidal and bell curves are also used, but the shape is generally less important than the number of curves and their placement. From three to seven curves are generally appropriate to cover the required range of an input value, or the "[[universe of discourse]]" in fuzzy jargon.

As discussed earlier, the processing stage is based on a collection of logic rules in the form of IF-THEN statements, where the IF part is called the "antecedent" and the THEN part is called the "consequent". Typical fuzzy control systems have dozens of rules.

Consider a rule for a thermostat:

   IF (temperature is "cold") THEN turn (heater is "high")

This rule uses the truth value of the "temperature" input, which is some truth value of "cold", to generate a result in the fuzzy set for the "heater" output, which is some value of "high". This result is used with the results of other rules to finally generate the crisp composite output. Obviously, the greater the truth value of "cold", the higher the truth value of "high", though this does not necessarily mean that the output itself will be set to "high" since this is only one rule among many. 
In some cases, the membership functions can be modified by "hedges" that are equivalent to adverbs. Common hedges include "about", "near", "close to", "approximately", "very", "slightly", "too", "extremely", and "somewhat". These operations may have precise definitions, though the definitions can vary considerably between different implementations. "Very", for one example, squares membership functions; since the membership values are always less than 1, this narrows the membership function. "Extremely" cubes the values to give greater narrowing, while "somewhat" broadens the function by taking the square root.

In practice, the fuzzy rule sets usually have several antecedents that are combined using fuzzy operators, such as AND, OR, and NOT, though again the definitions tend to vary: AND, in one popular definition, simply uses the minimum weight of all the antecedents, while OR uses the maximum value. There is also a NOT operator that subtracts a membership function from 1 to give the "complementary" function.

There are several ways to define the result of a rule, but one of the most common and simplest is the "max-min" [[inference]] method, in which the output membership function is given the truth value generated by the premise.

Rules can be solved in parallel in hardware, or sequentially in software. The results of all the rules that have fired are "defuzzified" to a crisp value by one of several methods. There are dozens, in theory, each with various advantages or drawbacks.

The "centroid" method is very popular, in which the "center of mass" of the result provides the crisp value. Another approach is the "height" method, which takes the value of the biggest contributor. The centroid method favors the rule with the output of greatest area, while the height method obviously favors the rule with the greatest output value.

The diagram below demonstrates max-min inferencing and centroid defuzzification for a system with input variables "x", "y", and "z" and an output variable "n". Note that "mu" is standard fuzzy-logic nomenclature for "truth value":

[[File:Fuzzy control - centroid defuzzification using max-min inferencing.png]]

Notice how each rule provides a result as a truth value of a particular membership function for the output variable. In centroid defuzzification the values are OR'd, that is, the maximum value is used and values are not added, and the results are then combined using a centroid calculation.

Fuzzy control system design is based on empirical methods, basically a methodical approach to [[trial-and-error]]. The general process is as follows:

* Document the system's operational specifications and inputs and outputs.
* Document the fuzzy sets for the inputs.
* Document the rule set.
* Determine the defuzzification method.
* Run through test suite to validate system, adjust details as required.
* Complete document and release to production.

As a general example, consider the design of a fuzzy controller for a steam turbine. The block diagram of this control system appears as follows:

&lt;!-- Missing image removed: [[File:fuzzy control block.png]] --&gt;

The input and output variables map into the following fuzzy set:

[[File:Fuzzy control - input and output variables mapped into a fuzzy set.png]]—where:

   N3:   Large negative.
   N2:   Medium negative.
   N1:   Small negative.
   Z:    Zero.
   P1:   Small positive.
   P2:   Medium positive.
   P3:   Large positive.

The rule set includes such rules as:

 rule 1:  IF temperature IS cool AND pressure IS weak,   
          THEN throttle is P3.

 rule 2:  IF temperature IS cool AND pressure IS low,    
          THEN throttle is P2.

 rule 3:  IF temperature IS cool AND pressure IS ok,     
          THEN throttle is Z.

 rule 4:  IF temperature IS cool AND pressure IS strong, 
          THEN throttle is N2.

In practice, the controller accepts the inputs and maps them into their membership functions and truth values. These mappings are then fed into the rules. If the rule specifies an AND relationship between the mappings of the two input variables, as the examples above do, the minimum of the two is used as the combined truth value; if an OR is specified, the maximum is used. The appropriate output state is selected and assigned a membership value at the truth level of the premise. The truth values are then defuzzified. 
For an example, assume the temperature is in the "cool" state, and the pressure is in the "low" and "ok" states. The pressure values ensure that only rules 2 and 3 fire:

[[File:Fuzzy control - Rule 2 evaluation.png]]

[[File:Fuzzy control - Rule 3 evaluation.png]]

The two outputs are then defuzzified through centroid defuzzification:

The output value will adjust the throttle and then the control cycle will begin again to generate the next value .

=== Building a fuzzy controller ===
Consider implementing with a microcontroller chip a simple feedback controller:

[[File:Fuzzy control system-feedback controller.png]]

A fuzzy set is defined for the input error variable "e", and the derived change in error, "delta", as well as the "output", as follows:

   LP:  large positive
   SP:  small positive
   ZE:  zero
   SN:  small negative
   LN:  large negative

If the error ranges from -1 to +1, with the analog-to-digital converter used having a resolution of 0.25, then the input variable's fuzzy set (which, in this case, also applies to the output variable) can be described very simply as a table, with the error / delta / output values in the top row and the truth values for each membership function arranged in rows beneath:

   _______________________________________________________________________
 
               -1    -0.75  -0.5   -0.25    0     0.25   0.5    0.75    1

    mu(SN)     0.3    0.7     1     0.7    0.3     0      0      0      0

   _______________________________________________________________________            —or, in graphical form (where each "X" has a value of 0.1):

          LN           SN           ZE           SP           LP

       |                                                                  |
       +------------------------------------------------------------------+

Suppose this fuzzy system has the following rule base:

   rule 1:  IF e = ZE AND delta = ZE THEN output = ZE
   rule 2:  IF e = ZE AND delta = SP THEN output = SN
   rule 3:  IF e = SN AND delta = SN THEN output = LP
   rule 4:  IF e = LP OR  delta = LP THEN output = LN

These rules are typical for control applications in that the antecedents consist of the logical combination of the error and error-delta signals, while the consequent is a control command output. 
The rule outputs can be defuzzified using a discrete centroid computation:

   SUM( I = 1 TO 4 OF ( mu(I) * output(I) ) ) / SUM( I = 1 TO 4 OF mu(I) )

Now, suppose that at a given time we have: 
   e     = 0.25
   delta = 0.5

Then this gives:

   ________________________
 
               e     delta
   ________________________
 
   mu(LP)      0      0.3
   mu(SP)     0.7      1
   mu(ZE)     0.7     0.3
   mu(SN)      0       0
   mu(LN)      0       0
   ________________________

Plugging this into rule 1 gives:

   rule 1:  IF e = ZE AND delta = ZE THEN output = ZE
  
      mu(1)     = MIN( 0.7, 0.3 ) = 0.3
      output(1) = 0

-- where:

* mu(1): Truth value of the result membership function for rule 1. In terms of a centroid calculation, this is the "mass" of this result for this discrete case.
* output(1):  Value (for rule 1) where the result membership function (ZE) is maximum over the output variable fuzzy set range. That is, in terms of a centroid calculation, the location of the "center of mass" for this individual result. This value is independent of the value of "mu". It simply identifies the location of ZE along the output range.

The other rules give:

   rule 2:  IF e = ZE AND delta = SP THEN output = SN
 
      mu(2)     = MIN( 0.7, 1 ) = 0.7   
      output(2) = -0.5

   rule 3: IF e = SN AND delta = SN THEN output = LP
 
      mu(3)     = MIN( 0.0, 0.0 ) = 0
      output(3) = 1

   rule 4: IF e = LP OR  delta = LP THEN output = LN
 
      mu(4)     = MAX( 0.0, 0.3 ) = 0.3
      output(4) = -1

The centroid computation yields:

   &lt;math&gt; \frac{mu(1) \cdot output(1)+mu(2) \cdot output(2)+mu(3) \cdot output(3)+mu(4) \cdot output(4)}{mu(1)+mu(2)+mu(3)+mu(4)} &lt;/math&gt;
   &lt;math&gt;=\frac{(0.3 \cdot 0)+(0.7 \cdot-0.5)+(0 \cdot 1) +(0.3 \cdot-1)}{0.3+0.7+0+0.3} &lt;/math&gt;
   &lt;math&gt;=-0.5&lt;/math&gt;—for the final control output. Simple. Of course the hard part is figuring out what rules actually work correctly in practice.

If you have problems figuring out the centroid equation, remember that a centroid is defined by summing all the moments (location times mass) around the center of gravity and equating the sum to zero. So if &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt; is the center of gravity, &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; is the location of each mass, and &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt; is each mass, this gives:

   &lt;math&gt;0 = ( X_1 - X_0 ) \cdot M_1 + ( X_2 - X_0 ) \cdot M_2 + \ldots + ( X_n - X_0 ) \cdot M_n&lt;/math&gt;
   &lt;math&gt;0 = ( X_1 \cdot M_1 + X_2 \cdot M_2 + \ldots + X_n \cdot M_n ) - X_0 \cdot ( M_1 + M_2 + \ldots + M_n ) &lt;/math&gt;
   &lt;math&gt; X_0 \cdot ( M_1 + M_2 + \ldots + M_n ) =  X_1 \cdot M_1 + X_2 \cdot M_2 + \ldots + X_n \cdot M_n &lt;/math&gt;
   &lt;math&gt; X_0 = \frac{ X_1 \cdot M_1 + X_2 \cdot M_2 + \ldots + X_n \cdot M_n }{ M_1 + M_2 + \ldots + M_n }&lt;/math&gt;

In our example, the values of mu correspond to the masses, and the values of X to location of the masses  
(mu, however, only 'corresponds to the masses' if the initial 'mass' of the output functions are all the same/equivalent. If they are not the same, i.e. some are narrow triangles, while others maybe wide trapizoids or shouldered triangles, then the mass or area of the output function must be known or calculated. It is this mass that is then scaled by mu and multiplied by its location X_i).

This system can be implemented on a standard microprocessor, but dedicated fuzzy chips are now available. For example, Adaptive Logic INC of San Jose, California, sells a "fuzzy chip", the AL220, that can accept four analog inputs and generate four analog outputs. A block diagram of the chip is shown below:

== Antilock brakes ==
As a first example, consider an [[anti-lock braking system]], directed by a microcontroller chip. The microcontroller has to make decisions based on brake [[temperature]], [[speed]], and other variables in the system.

The variable "temperature" in this system can be subdivided into a range of "states": "cold", "cool", "moderate", "warm", "hot", "very hot". The transition from one state to the next is hard to define.

An arbitrary static threshold might be set to divide "warm" from "hot". For example, at exactly 90 degrees, warm ends and hot begins. But this would result in a discontinuous change when the input value passed over that threshold. The transition wouldn't be smooth, as would be required in braking situations.

The way around this is to make the states ''fuzzy''. That is, allow them to change gradually from one state to the next. In order to do this there must be a dynamic relationship established between different factors.

We start by defining the input temperature states using "membership functions":

[[File:Fuzzy control - definition of input temperature states using membership functions.png]]

With this scheme, the input variable's state no longer jumps abruptly from one state to the next. Instead, as the temperature changes, it loses value in one membership function while gaining value in the next. In other words, its ranking in the category of cold decreases as it becomes more highly ranked in the warmer category.

At any sampled timeframe, the "truth value" of the brake temperature will almost always be in some degree part of two membership functions: i.e.: '0.6 nominal and 0.4 warm', or '0.7 nominal and 0.3 cool', and so on.

The above example demonstrates a simple application, using the [[abstraction]] of values from multiple values. This only represents one kind of data, however, in this case, temperature.

Adding additional sophistication to this braking system, could be done by additional factors such as [[Traction (engineering)|traction]], speed, [[inertia]], set up in dynamic functions, according to the designed fuzzy system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vichuzhanin|first=Vladimir|title=Realization of a fuzzy controller with fuzzy dynamic correction|journal=Central European Journal of Engineering|date=12 April 2012|volume=2|issue=3|pages=392–398|doi=10.2478/s13531-012-0003-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logical interpretation of fuzzy control==
In spite of the appearance there are several difficulties to give a rigorous logical interpretation of the ''IF-THEN'' rules. As an example, interpret a rule as  ''IF (temperature is "cold") THEN (heater is "high")'' by the first order formula ''Cold(x)→High(y)'' and assume that r is an input such that ''Cold(r)'' is false. Then the formula ''Cold(r)→High(t)'' is true for any ''t'' and therefore any ''t'' gives a correct control given ''r''. A rigorous logical justification of fuzzy control is given in Hájek's book (see Chapter 7) where fuzzy control is represented as a theory of Hájek's basic logic.&lt;ref name = "Hájek" /&gt; Also in Gerla 2005 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerla|first1=Giangiacomo|title=Fuzzy logic programming and fuzzy control|journal=Studia Logica|date=2005|volume=79|issue=2|pages=231–254|doi=10.1007/s11225-005-2977-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; another logical approach to fuzzy control is proposed based on fuzzy logic programming.Indeed, denote by ''f'' the fuzzy function arising of an IF-THEN systems of rules. Then we can translate this system into a fuzzy program P containing a series of rules whose head is "Good(x,y)". The interpretation of this predicate in the least fuzzy [[Herbrand model]] of P coincides with f. This gives further useful tools to fuzzy control.

Born in [[St. Petersburg]], he studied [[psychology]] at the universities of [[Leipzig]] and [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] (1907–12), and Georgian-[[Armenian language|Armenian]]-[[Persian language|Persian]] philology at the [[Petrograd University]] (1916–17). Returning to Georgia, he served as a professor at the [[Tbilisi State University]] (1918–31, 1937–48). He was one of the founding fathers and the first rector of [[Tbilisi State Academy of Arts]] (former Fine Arts (1922–28). From 1941 until his death, he directed the Institute of the History of Georgian Arts at the [[Georgian Academy of Sciences]] (now the National Centre for Georgian Art History and Heritage Preservation) which has been named after him. His works are chiefly focused on medieval Georgian and Armenian architecture, as well as on wall painting and sculpture.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; His major works cover [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and the [[Psalms]], and his major interests centered on the oral tradition behind written sources and in folklore.

== Biography ==
Gunkel was born in [[Springe]], [[Kingdom of Hanover]],&lt;ref name=EB /&gt; where his father and grandfather were [[Lutheran]] [[pastor]]s.&lt;ref name=briefhistory&gt;{{cite book | last=Gignilliat | first=Mark S. | title=A Brief History of Old Testament Criticism | year=2012 | publisher=Zondervan | location=Grand Rapids, MI | page=108 | chapter=Hermann Gunkel | chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=WrJln5IwiZ8C&amp;pg=PT108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He studied at the [[University of Göttingen]] and the [[University of Giessen]]. He eventually taught at both universities in addition to those of [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[University of Halle-Wittenberg|Halle]].&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;{{cite book | chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=oFLGroLOKq8C&amp;pg=PA499#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oFLGroLOKq8C | editor-last=McKim | editor-first=Donald K | first=M.

Gunkel started his career in [[New Testament]] studies at [[Göttingen]] in 1888. However, he was soon transferred to [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] (1889-1894) and told to concentrate on the [[Hebrew Bible]] by the Prussian academic appointments authority. He went on to teach in [[Berlin]] (1894-1907), where he made many inter-disciplinary contacts. His 1895 book, ''Creation and Chaos in the Primeval Era and the Eschaton'', compared the symbolism in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 12. In 1901, he produced the first of three editions of commentary on Genesis, ''Genesis Translated and Explained''.&lt;ref name=dictionary /&gt;

In 1907, Gunkel finally obtained a full professorship at the [[University of Giessen]]. There he produced the third and final edition of ''Genesis'' in 1910 and ''The Prophets'' in 1917. He moved to the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg]] in 1920. He published another standard work, his commentary on the book of [[Psalms]], ''The Psalms: Translated and Explained'' in 1926. ''Introduction to the Psalms'' was his last major project, brought to completion by his student [[Joachim Begrich]] in 1933.&lt;ref name=dictionary /&gt;

Gunkel founded the series ''Research into the Religion and Literature of the Old and New Testaments'' (1903-) with [[Wilhelm Bousset]].&lt;ref name=EB /&gt; He also co-edited with Leopold Zscharnack the second edition of the German religious encyclopedia ''Religion in History and the Present'' (1927-1931), in which he authored over one hundred articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Psalms: A Form-Critical Introduction | url=http://www.ericlevy.com/revel/Psalms/Gunkel%20H%20-%20The%20Psalms%20-%20A%20Form-Critical%20Introduction%20Abridged.PDF | first=James | last=Muilenburg | author-link=James Muilenburg|chapter=Introduction | location=Philadelphia | publisher=Fortress Press | year=1967 | page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunkel became a leading representative of the "[[history of religions school]]" (''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule''), which addressed the history of traditions behind the biblical text. In addition to Gunkel, the original group also included [[Albert Eichhorn]], [[William Wrede]], Heinrich Hackmann, [[Alfred Rahlfs]], [[Johannes Weiss]], [[Wilhelm Bousset]], [[Ernst Troeltsch]], and [[Wilhelm Heitmüller]].&lt;ref name=ludemann&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  In these works he created the new critical methodology of [[form criticism]] (''Formgeschichte'').&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Muilenburg|first=James| author-link=James Muilenburg|title=Form Criticism and beyond|journal=Journal of Biblical Literature|date=March 1969|volume=88|issue=1|pages=1–18|jstor=3262829|doi=10.2307/3262829}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Form criticism examined the genres used in the biblical text to identify the ''[[Sitz im Leben]]'' (setting in life) that produced the text. This approach was based on the assumption that each genre is organically associated with a particular social and historical situation. Nineteenth-century [[source criticism]] had examined the biblical text, especially the [[Pentateuch]], on the basis of style, vocabulary, theology, and other criteria to identify the basic literary sources used to create the text. Form criticism allowed scholars to go behind these larger literary sources by identifying the smaller and older sources used by their authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Form Criticism |url=http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/article/opr/t94/e693 |work=Oxford Biblical Studies Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its utility, form criticism became immensely influential in Germany and Europe during the 20th century, with important scholars like [[Gerhard von Rad]] and [[Martin Noth]] applying and developing it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

'''Homeorhesis''', derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] for "similar flow", is a concept encompassing [[dynamical systems]] which return to a [[trajectory]], as opposed to systems which return to a particular state, which is termed [[homeostasis]].

==Biology==
Homeorhesis is steady flow. Often biological systems are inaccurately described as homeostatic, being in a steady state. Steady state implies equilibrium which is never reached, nor are organisms and ecosystems in a closed environment. During his tenure at the State University of New York at Oneonta, Dr William Butts&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oneonta.edu/academics/biofld/facultystaff.asp&lt;/ref&gt; correctly applied the term homeorhesis to biological organisms. The term was first used in biology by [[C.H. Waddington]] around 1940, where he described the tendency of developing or changing organisms to continue development or adapting to their environment and changing towards a given state.

==Gaia hypothesis==
{{wiktionary}}
In [[ecology]] the concept is important as an element of the [[Gaia hypothesis]], where the system under consideration is the ecological balance of different forms of life on the planet. It was [[Lynn Margulis]], the coauthor of Gaia hypothesis, who wrote in particular that only homeorhetic, and not homeostatic, balances are involved in the theory.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} That is, the composition of Earth's atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere are regulated around "set points" as in homeostasis, but those set points change with time.

[[File:Hipogeu Cala en Blanes 10 oct.jpg|thumb|Entrance of the hypogeum of Torre del Ram. ]]
The '''Hypogeum of Torre del Ram''' is an archaeological site of de '''Torre del Ram''', in Cala en Blanes ([[Ciutadella de Menorca]]), is a [[Bronze Age]] funerary [[hypogeum]], which was used as a collective tomb by a family or a small community. Even though it was emptied in later centuries to be reused as a cattle shelter, which caused the loss of all the information about the interred population, grave goods and chronology, its resemblance with other prehistoric tombs of Menorca dates it to between 1700 and 1400 BC.

A stepped corridor leads to the tomb's rectangular chamber, which has a stone bench that surrounds its internal perimeter. Part of the stone gallery, which used to cover the corridor and the entrance, is still preserved, which was built with the cyclopean{{explain|date=December 2017}} technique. 

The corridor is 2.60 m long, while the dimensions of the chamber are: 8.80 m long, 2.50 m wide and 1.95 m high. 
[[File:TORRE DEL RAM interior.jpg|thumb|right|View of the chamber of Torre del Ram hypogeum, ]]

The walls of the internal chamber present several engravings representing three sailing ships and other undetermined figures. Some authors claim the importance of these elements, since they could date back to the [[Bronze Age]].  However, the date of these engraving has not been determined and could have been made in any other subsequent period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.menorcatalayotica.info/Contingut.aspx?IdPub=8574#ancla4&lt;/ref&gt;

Invitational rhetoric is part of an effort to formulate alternative conceptions of rhetoric that are not “exploitative and oppressive but that contribute to a more respectful way of being a rhetor in the world.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A major assumption behind invitational rhetoric is that “the communication discipline, through its traditional constructs and theories, participates in this culture of domination,” and invitational rhetoric constitutes an effort to “contribute to the creation of more humane lives” for individuals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Core elements==
Invitational rhetoric is rooted in three feminist principles that “explicitly challenge the positive value the patriarchy accords to changing and thus dominating others”—equality, immanent value, and self-determination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Equality: In contrast to the traditional rhetoric of persuasion, in which the rhetor is seen as superior to the audience, the rhetor and the audience are viewed as equal peers who share authority and expertise and contribute equally to an interaction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inviting Transformation: Presentational Speaking for a Changing World|last=Foss|first=Sonja K.|last2=Foss|first2=Karen A.|publisher=Waveland|year=2012|isbn=1-57766-721-2|edition=3|location=Long Grove, IL|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Makau|first=Josina M.|date=Spring-Summer 1996|title=Notes on Communication Education and Social Justice|url=|journal=Communication Studies|volume=47|pages=139|doi=10.1080/10510979609368469|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Immanent value: Immanent value means that all individuals have unique, unrepeatable perspectives that should be appreciated for what they contribute to an interaction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* Self-determination: Self-determination is the principle that others are competent individuals who should be allowed to make their own decisions about their lives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
Although change is not the objective of invitational rhetoric, change may occur as a result of an invitational interaction. Interacting with others inevitably produces changes of various kinds in interactants, but in the case of invitational rhetoric, both the rhetor and the audience may choose to change their perspectives as a result of the process of sharing perspectives. They do not, however, enter the interaction trying to impose their perspectives on and trying to change one another.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ryan|first=Kathleen J.|last2=Natalle|first2=Elizabeth J.|date=2001|title=Fusing Horizons: Standpoint Hermeneutics and Invitational Rhetoric|url=|journal=Rhetoric Society Quarterly|volume=21|pages=71-80|doi=10.1080/02773940109391200|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants in invitational rhetoric value diverse perspectives because they recognize that every perspective is partial; as a result, they seek multiple perspectives to gain a more comprehensive understanding of an issue or situation. Invitational rhetors are particularly interested in exploring perspectives that are different from their own because they provide them with new information that enlarges their understanding.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Because they are eager to engage different perspectives and to allow them to affect their own thinking, invitational participants enter an interaction willing to call into question their own perspectives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In contrast to persuasive rhetoric, which involves power-over and an attempt to establish power over others by changing them, in invitational rhetoric, the kind of power involved is power-with.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This type of power is shared among the audience members and the rhetor and is used by all participants together to come to an understanding, to make a decision, or to solve a problem.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Truth or Dare: Encounters with Power, Authority, and Mystery|last=Starhawk|first=|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|year=1990|isbn=0-06-250816-4|location=San Francisco|pages=10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist Rhetorical Theories|last=Foss|first=Karen A.|last2=Foss|first2=Sonja K.|last3=Griffin|first3=Cindy L.|publisher=Waveland|year=1999|isbn=1-57766-496-5|location=Long Grove, IL|pages=182-83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Invitational rhetoric is one of many useful rhetorical options; it is not designed to be used in all situations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is one of five modes of rhetoric—conquest, conversion, benevolent, advisory, and invitational—available to rhetors. In ''conquest rhetoric'', rhetors try to establish their idea as the best among competing positions. ''Conversion rhetoric'' is rhetoric that is designed to change the minds or behaviors of others by convincing them that another way is superior. In ''benevolent rhetoric'', the objective is to help individuals improve their lives and often involves providing useful information to others. ''Advisory rhetoric'' is designed to provide assistance requested by others; it is a response to an implicit or explicit request for information or advice.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lloyd|first=Keith|date=Spring 2014|title=Feminist Challenges to ‘Academic Writing’ Writ Larger: Changing the Argumentative Metaphor from War to Perception to Address the Problem of Argument Culture|url=|journal=Intertexts|volume=18|pages=34|doi=10.1353/itx.2014.0004|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetorical options in invitational rhetoric==
There are two primary rhetorical options in invitational rhetoric: (1) offering perspectives; and (2) creating external conditions that encourage audience members to share their perspectives with the rhetor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Offering perspectives===
Offering perspectives is the way by which rhetors share their perspectives with audience members, explaining what they know or understand about an issue or idea without advocating for those perspectives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Offering occurs verbally through the use of words to explain a rhetor’s perspective or nonverbally through wearing particular kinds of clothing or displaying symbols that suggest an individual’s identification. Wearing a charity bracelet, for example, suggests that a rhetor is identified with a certain cause or issue. Wearers of the bracelets are not attempting to persuade others to support the cause but are simply offering a perspective so that those who are curious about the bracelet can choose to explore the perspective being offered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Offering perspectives may be difficult to do in hostile situations when other interactants are not interested in hearing a different perspective or when conquest and conversion rhetorics are being used. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In such cases, invitational rhetors may use re-sourcement so that they can offer their perspectives and continue to engage in invitational rhetoric. ''Re-sourcement'' is a term coined by feminist theorist [[Sally Miller Gearhart]] that means drawing energy from a new source—“a source other than the individual or system that provided the initial frame for the issue.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Women’s Spirituality: Essays on the Rise of Spiritual Power within the Feminist Movement|last=Miller Gearhart|first=Sally|publisher=Doubleday|year=1982|isbn=|editor-last=Spretnak|editor-first=Charlene|location=Garden City, NY|pages=95|chapter=Womanpower: Energy Re-Sourcement}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Re-sourcement involves two basic processes. The first is disengaging from the frame of the precipitating message—stepping away from the frame in which the message is being offered and recognizing that the response does not have to be couched in that same frame.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The second process is developing a message that “does not directly argue against or even address the message being offered. It presents a response addressed to a different exigence, need, or problem from the one implicit” in the initial message.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The use of re-sourcement allows rhetors to value both themselves and their audience members and provides a space for more options for interaction in the future because it has not locked participants into an adversarial framework.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

An example of re-sourcement is a response suggested by linguist [[Suzette Haden Elgin]] to instances of sexual harassment. She offers what she calls the ''Boring Baroque Response'' to unwanted sexual proposals or sexually suggestive remarks. This strategy involves responding to such messages by telling a long story with many tedious details that is unrelated to and does not address the proposition offered by the instigator of the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How to Disagree Without Being Disagreeable: Getting Your Point Across with the Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense|last=Haden Elgin|first=Suzette|publisher=John Wiley|year=1997|isbn=0-471-15705-8|location=New York|pages=145-46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Creating external conditions===
The second primary rhetorical option in invitational rhetoric is creating external conditions. This option involves creating an environment that encourages audience members to share their perspectives with the rhetor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To accomplish this objective, the invitational rhetor attempts to create three conditions—safety, value, and freedom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* Safety: Safety is the creation of “a feeling of security and freedom from danger for the audience.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When safety is created in a rhetorical situation, audience members feel secure both physically and intellectually.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Invitation to Public Speaking|last=Griffin|first=Cindy L.|publisher=Cengage|year=2018|isbn=978-1-305-94808-2|location=Boston|pages=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; They feel like they can safely share and question ideas and that the rhetor with whom they are sharing their perspectives will respect their ideas and will not degrade or belittle them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

* Value: Value is acknowledgment by the rhetor that the audience members have intrinsic worth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Rhetors show that they value audience members when they treat them as unique individuals with worthwhile perspectives. They listen carefully to and seriously consider the perspectives audience members share. As a result, they encourage audience members to contribute in significant ways to the interaction.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Freedom: When rhetors give audience members freedom, they do not expect them to make the same choices they have made; they give them the freedom to believe and act as they themselves choose.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Invitational rhetors allow any subjects to be introduced into the interaction and allow all assumptions to be questioned.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Freedom also means that rhetors are not disappointed or angry if audience members choose not to adopt the perspectives they offer. The relationship between rhetor and audience will not be disrupted because of the difference in their perspectives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

({{ISBN|978-1-305-94808-2}})

==Critiques of the theory==
Following are the major critiques that have been offered of the theory of invitational rhetoric. Some of the criticisms of invitational rhetoric concern conceptions of the nature and function of persuasion:
* Persuasion is not violent, as invitational rhetoric suggests that it is.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lozano-Reich|first=Nina M.|last2=Cloud|first2=Dana L.|date=April-June 2009|title=The Uncivil Tongue: Invitational Rhetoric and the Problem of Inequality|url=|journal=Western Journal of Communication|volume=73|pages=221|doi=10.1080/10570310902856105|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics suggest that [[Sonja K. Foss]] and Cindy L. Griffin’s view that rhetoric constitutes violence because it represents an attempt to violate another person’s belief system is a flawed perspective.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Condit|first=Celeste Michelle|date=Fall 1997|title=In Praise of Eloquent Diversity: Gender and Rhetoric as Public Persuasion|url=|journal=Women’s Studies in Communication|volume=20|pages=92-98, 101-107|doi=10.1080/07491409.1997.10162405|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics note that those who engage in persuasion are not always trying to impose their will on audience members.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In addition, such a view ignores the nature of audiences. Audience members may refuse to listen to persuasive messages and “have substantial power to resist messages with which they do not agree.”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jørgensen|first=Charlotte|date=2007|title=The Relevance of Intention in Argument Evaluation|url=|journal=Argumentatio|volume=21|pages=165-6|doi=10.1007/s10503-007-9044-|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, their individual belief systems are not being violated. These critics believe that “the impulse to persuade others is a constructive and valuable aspect of human symbolic interaction.”&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
* Democracy will be undermined if persuasion is disallowed. The intent to change minds and situations is at the root of the deliberative process that takes place in a democracy. If persuasion is not seen as legitimate, democracy cannot be sustained.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
* Invitational rhetoric necessarily involves persuasion. Rhetors cannot help but be involved in persuasion when they offer their perspectives because the definition of rhetoric is persuasion; thus, persuasion or influence is an integral part of every symbolic interaction.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some critics use as support for this claim Foss and Griffin’s initial article on invitational rhetoric. Although Foss and Griffin explain in this article that they are attempting to use the features of invitational rhetoric as they describe the theory, some critics suggest that, when they write about invitational rhetoric, they themselves are arguing that others should share their views.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus, even Foss and Griffin cannot help but be engaged in persuasion, even when they are describing invitational rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fulkerson|first=Richard|date=Spring 1996|title=Transcending Our Conception of Argument in Light of Feminist Critiques|url=|journal=Argumentation and Advocacy|volume=32|pages=204-5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;
* Invitational rhetoric cannot involve agency because the enactment of agency is only possible through an effort to persuade others. Although ''agency'' has many different definitions, some scholars limit the definition to the effort to change others—unless rhetors are working to get others to change their positions, they are not enacting agency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In such a view, agency does not involve the kinds of activities involved in invitational rhetoric such as understanding, listening, exploring, and sharing. Perspectives are exchanged, but because the rhetors do not take action in the form of attempting to persuade, they do not enact agency.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
Other critiques of the theory of invitational rhetoric are concerned with the nature of rhetoric and rhetorical theory:
* The theory of invitational rhetoric is based on a simplistic, reductive account of rhetorical theory and practice. The rhetorical traditional is not characterized by a patriarchal bias because many definitions of rhetoric focus on interaction rather than coercion.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The interaction of gender with rhetoric has been complicated and varied throughout the rhetorical tradition.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

* The appropriate objective for rhetorical engagement is social change, and it cannot be accomplished through invitational rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Invitational rhetoric valorizes non-confrontational and civil modes of interaction and thus cannot resist injustice and inequality; consequently, invitational rhetoric is “disabling to the oppressed.”&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lloyd|first=Keith|date=2016|title=Beyond ‘Dichotonegative’ Rhetoric: Interpreting Field Reactions to Feminist Critiques of Academic Rhetoric through an Alternate Multivalent Rhetoric|url=|journal=Rhetorica|volume=34|pages=95|doi=10.1525/rh.2016.34.1.78|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Invitational rhetoric replaces ''rhetoric'' with ''communication studies'' and thus does a disservice to the field of rhetoric. Foss and Griffin see the terms as synonymous, but they are not.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The term ''rhetoric'' means public persuasion, so invitational rhetoric situates rhetoric in a different realm—the realm of private, non-persuasive interaction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This is not an appropriate realm for rhetoric, and the status of rhetoric is devalued as a result of invitational rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
Other critiques of invitational rhetoric have to do with a variety of other aspects of the theory:
* A key tenet of invitational rhetoric is that all individuals have value; however, not all opinions or views have value. Invitational rhetors see others’ perspectives as significant and as providing important input into an interaction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Critics suggest, however, that not all perspectives are equally valuable. Those that cause harm, suffering, and death—such as those of wife abusers and rapists—should not be granted unconditional value and should not be appreciated and included in invitational dialogues.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mathison|first=Maureen A.|date=May 1997|title=The Complicity of Essentializing Difference: Complicity as Epistemology: Reinscribing the Historical Categories of ‘Woman’ Through Standpoint Feminism|url=|journal=Communication Theory|volume=7|pages=156|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.1997.tb00146.x|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
* The principles of immanent value and self-determination contradict the dialogic goal of understanding at the heart of invitational rhetoric. Immanent value and self-determination imply a focus on the solitary self and suggest that individuals should close themselves off from other perspectives and privilege their own perspectives.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; But the invitational practices of offering and willingness to yield are dependent upon interrelationships with others and require knowing and interacting with other people.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Mutual enlargement can only happen in interaction, and such interaction contradicts key practices of invitational rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Invitational rhetoric must include all of the ideas espoused by the theorists who influenced the development of invitational rhetoric. Ideas of theorists on which invitational rhetoric is based that were not a part of the theory of invitational rhetoric—such as [[Sally Miller Gearhart]]’s biologism and [[Sonia Johnson]]’s separatism—are imported into and considered part of the theory of invitational rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dow|first=Bonnie J.|date=Spring-Summer 1995|title=Feminism, Difference(s), and Rhetorical Studies|url=|journal=Communication Studies|volume=46|pages=110-11, 113|doi=10.1080/10510979509368442|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critiques of any aspect of theories developed by those who have contributed to invitational rhetoric are applicable to invitational rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;
Two of the common criticisms of invitational rhetoric are misreadings of the theory. They attribute claims to invitational rhetoric that are the opposite of what Sonja Foss and Cindy Griffin explain in their original article on invitational rhetoric:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Invitational rhetoric is not appropriate in every situation. Although Foss and Griffin state that “invitational rhetoric is one of many useful and legitimate rhetorics, including persuasion, in which rhetors will want to be skilled,” some critics see them as calling for the use of invitational rhetoric on all occasions. These critics argue that there are times when persuasion should be used, such as in fighting fascism or trying to talk a friend out of committing suicide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pollock|first=Mark|last2=Artz|first2=Lee|last3=Frey|first3=Lawrence R.|last4=Pearce|first4=W.

* Because invitational rhetoric is a form of rhetoric appropriate only for women, it reifies the gender binary and essentializes women.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bruner|first=M. Lane|date=Spring 1996|title=Producing Identities: Gender Problematization and Feminist Argumentation|url=|journal=Argumentation and Advocacy|volume=32|pages=185, 187|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although Foss and Griffin state that invitational rhetoric is not confined to “a particular population of rhetors” and is “used at various times by some women and some men, some feminists and some non-feminists,” some critics see invitational rhetoric as appropriate for women only.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; These critics equate patriarchy with the masculine gender, and because Foss and Griffin label traditional rhetoric as ''patriarchal'', these critics see the alternative—invitational rhetoric—as linked exclusively to the feminine gender.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

She was the first female lexicographer in France, and held many prominent posts in this field, where she used her influence to promote [[feminist]] changes to French language usage.

== Early career ==
A graduate of the [[University of Sorbonne]], with a doctorate of linguistics, she began her career in 1952 as a lecturer of French at the College of Paris. The following year, she became an editor of language dictionaries at the Société du Nouveau Littré. She subsequently worked at Dictionnaires Le Robert, the most prominent publisher of dictionaries in the French language. It was there that she met Alain Rey, whom she married on September 11, 1954.

She contributed to dictionaries for [[Dictionnaires Le Robert]], collaborating on the Petit Robert for the French language, at Robert des Enfants (the company's division for publishing the Children's Robert dictionaries), then to Dictionnaire du français (foreign language edition) and to Robert Méthodique-Brio. In 1977, she became secretary-general of Dictionnaires Le Robert, a position she held until 1994.

==Influence==
A well-known linguist who promoted feminist changes to French usage, she was named to various commissions to develop the standards of the  language : the Commission de la féminisation du vocabulaire au ministère des droits de la femme between 1984 et 1985, the Commission d'expertise pour la réforme de l'orthographe au Conseil supérieur de la langue française in 1989, the Commission d'orientation pour la simplification du language administratif au ministère de la Fonction publique et de la Réforme de l'État in 2001, the Office québécois de la langue française sur la terminologie, la néologie et la méthodologie du travail terminologique during the 1970s.

She was also a professor of lexicology and semiology at the University Paris III-Sorbonne Nouvelle throughout the 1970s, subsequently at the University Paris VII-Denis Diderot during the 1980s, and at the École des hautes études en sciences sociales beginning in 2002. A friend of many of the members of [[Oulipo]] (Bernard Cerquiglini, Paul Fournel), she was their visiting scholar in 1986.

'''Land development''' is altering the [[landscape]] in any number of ways such as:
* Changing [[landforms]] from a [[natural]] or semi-natural state for a purpose such as [[agriculture]] or [[House|housing]]
* [[subdivision (land)|Subdividing]] [[real estate]] into [[Lot (real estate)|lots]], typically for the purpose of building [[home]]s
* [[Real estate development]] or changing its purpose, for example by converting an unused [[factory]] complex into [[condominium|condominia]].

==Economic aspects==
In an economics context, land development is also sometimes advertised as '''land improvement''' or '''land amelioration'''. It refers to [[investment]]s making land more usable by humans. For accounting purposes it refers to any variety of projects that increase the [[property value|value of the property]]. Most are depreciable, but some land improvements are not able to be depreciated because a useful life cannot be determined. [[Home building]] and [[containment]] are two of the most common and the oldest types of development.

In an [[Urban development|urban]] context, land development furthermore includes:
* [[Road construction]]
** [[Access road]]s, [[walkway]]s and [[parking lot]]s
** [[Bridge|Bridging]]
* [[Landscaping]]
** [[Deforestation|Clearing]], [[Terrace (agriculture)|terracing]] or [[land levelling]]
* Setup of [[fence]]s and, to a lesser degree, [[hedge]]s
* Service connections to [[municipal service]]s and public utilities
* [[Drainage]], [[canal]]s
* External lighting ([[street lamp]]s, etc.)

[[Landowner]] or developers on any size of project will often want to [[profit maximization|maximise profits]], minimise [[risk analysis|risk]] and control [[cash flow]]. This "profit enhancement" means identifying and developing the best scheme for the local marketplace, whilst satisfying the local planning process.

'''Development Analysis''' puts development prospects and the development process itself under the microscope, identifying where enhancements and improvements can be introduced. These improvements aim to align with best design practice, political sensitivities, and the inevitable social requirements of a project, with the overarching objective of increasing [[land value]]s and [[profit margin]]s on behalf of the landowner or developer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=David E. |date=2008 |title=Fundamentals of Land Development |chapter=4. Marketing Studies and Market Considerations |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page= |isbn=9780471778936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development analysis can add significantly to the value of land and development, and as such is a crucial tool for landowners and developers. It is an essential step in [[Kevin A. Lynch]]'s 1960 book ''[[The Image of the City]]'', and is considered to be essential to realizing the value potential of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lynch, Kevin |title=The Image of the City |publisher= [[MIT Press]] |location=Cambridge MA |year=1960 |ol=5795447M}}&lt;/ref&gt; The landowner can share in additional planning gain (significant value uplift) via an awareness of the land's development [[economic potential|potential]]. This is done via a residual development appraisal or residual valuation. The residual appraisal calculates the sale value of the end product (the Gross Development Value, or GDV), and hypothetically deducts costs, including planning and [[construction]] costs, finance costs and developer's profit. The "residue", or leftover proportion, represents the land value. Therefore, in maximising the GDV (that which one could build on the land), land value is concurrently enhanced.

Land value is highly sensitive to [[supply and demand]] (for the end product), build costs, planning and [[affordable housing]] contributions, and so on. Understanding the intricacies of the development system and the effect of "value drivers" can result in massive differences in the landowner's sale value.

==Conversion of landforms==
Land development puts more emphasis on the expected [[economic development]] as a result of the process; "land conversion" tries to focus on the general physical and biological aspects of the [[land use]] change. "Land improvement" in the economic sense can often lead to [[land degradation]] from the ecological perspective. Land development and the change in land value does not usually take into account changes in the ecology of the developed area. While conversion of (rural) land with a [[vegetation]] carpet to [[building land]] may result in a rise in [[economic growth]] and rising [[land price]]s, the [[irreversibility]] of lost flora and fauna because of [[habitat destruction]], the loss of [[ecosystem services]] and resulting decline in [[environmental cost|environmental value]] is only considered ''a priori'' in [[environmental full-cost accounting]].

===Conversion to building land===
[[File:Motorway construction in Ireland.JPG|thumb|Motorway construction in Ireland]]
Conversion to building land is as a rule associated with [[road building]], which in itself already brings [[topsoil]] abrasion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |date=2009-09-03 |title=Top soil is removed from the new road bed |medium=Video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6htJvcohDXo |location=Dayton, TN |publisher=Bryan College}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[soil compaction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Urban Soil Compaction |date=March 2000 |series=Soil Quality – Urban Technical Note No. 2 |url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcs142p2_053278.pdf |publisher=U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service, Soil Quality Instsitute |location=Auburn, AL}}&lt;/ref&gt; and modification of the soil's chemical composition through [[soil stabilization]], creation of [[impervious surface]]s and, subsequently, (polluted) [[surface runoff]] water.
[[File:Varvarin - Building construction (USACE project).jpg|thumb|Building construction]]
Construction activity often effectively seals off a larger part of the soil from [[rainfall]] and the [[nutrient cycle]], so that the soil below buildings and roads is effectively "consumed" and made [[soil fertility|infertile]].

With the notable exception of attempts at [[rooftop garden]]ing and hanging gardens in [[green building]]s (possibly as constituents of [[green urbanism]]), [[vegetative cover]] of higher plants is lost to [[concrete]] and [[asphalt]] surfaces, complementary interspersed [[garden]] and [[park]] areas notwithstanding.

===Conversion to farmland===
[[File:Soy_forest.jpg|thumb|In Argentina and Bolivia, the [[Chaco (Paraguay)|Chaco]] [[thorn forest]] (A) is being felled at a rate considered among the highest in the world (B), to give way to [[soybean]] cultivation (C)]]

New creation of [[farmland]] (or 'agricultural land conversion') will rely on the conversion and development of previous [[forest]]s, [[savanna]]s or [[grassland]]. Recreation of farmland from [[Barren vegetation|wasteland]], [[desert]]s or previous impervious surfaces is considerably less frequent because of the degraded or missing [[soil fertility|fertile soil]] in the latter. Starting from forests, land is made [[arable land|arable]] by [[assarting]] or [[slash-and-burn]]. 
[[agriculture|Agricultural]] development furthermore includes: 
* Hydrological measures (land levelling, drainage, [[irrigation]], sometimes [[landslide]] and [[flood control]])
* [[Soil improvement]] ([[fertilization (soil)|fertilization]], establishment of a productive chemical balance).
* Road construction

[[File:Oil palm and rainforest fragment Borneo.JPG|thumb|left|[[Oil palm]] plantation and rainforest fragment on Borneo]]
Because the newly created farmland is more prone to [[erosion]] than soil stabilized by [[tree root]]s, such a conversion may mean irreversible crossing of an [[ecological threshold]].

{{see also|Horton overland flow}}

The resulting [[deforestation]] is also not easily compensated for by [[reforestation]] or [[afforestation]]. This is because [[plantation]]s of other trees as a means for [[water conservation]] and protection against wind [[erosion]] ([[shelterbelt]]s), as a rule, lack the [[biodiversity]] of the lost forest, especially when realized as [[monoculture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Sarah Jane |url=http://blog.ucsusa.org/science-blogger/not-all-forests-are-created-equal-reforesting-the-tropics-for-people-biodiversity-and-carbon-629 |title=Not All Forests Are Created Equal: Reforesting the Tropics for People, Biodiversity, and Carbon |date=2014-08-14 |website=The Equation (Blog) |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Boucher |first1=Doug |title=The Root of the Problem: What's Driving tropical Deforestation today? |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/global_warming/UCS_RootoftheProblem_DriversofDeforestation_FullReport.pdf |date=June 2011 |series=Tropical Forest and Climate Initiative |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carbontradewatch.org/issues/monoculture.html |title=Monocultures |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher=Carbon Trade Watch |location=Barcelona, Spain |access-date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brockerhoff |first1=E.G. |last2=Jactel |first2=H. |last3=Parrotta |first3=J. |last4=Quine |first4=C.P. |last5=Sayer |first5=J. |date=2008-04-09 |title=Plantation forests and biodiversity: oxymoron or opportunity? |journal=Biodiversity and Conservation |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=925–951 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10531-008-9380-x |doi=10.1007/s10531-008-9380-x |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[soil stabilization]] and [[erosion control]] measures may not be as effective in preserving [[topsoil]] as the previous intact [[vegetation]].

===Restoration===
Massive land conversion without proper consideration of [[ecological]] and [[geological]] consequences may lead to disastrous [[Land degradation|results]], such as: 
* General [[soil degradation]]
** Catastrophic [[soil salination]] and [[solonchak]] formation, e.g., in [[Central Asia]], as a consequence of irrigation by saline [[groundwater]]
** [[Desertification]], soil [[erosion]] and ecological shifts due to drainage
** [[Leaching (agriculture)|Leaching]] of saline soils
* [[Habitat loss]] for the wildlife.

While deleterious effects can be particularly visible when land is developed for industrial or mining usage, agro-industrial and settlement use can also have a massive and sometimes irreversible [[environmental impact|impact]] on the affected ecosystem.

Examples of [[land restoration]]/[[land rehabilitation]] counted as land development in the strict sense are still rare. However, [[Ecological restoration|renaturation]], [[reforestation]], [[stream restoration]] may all contribute to a [[environmental health|healthier environment]] and quality of life, especially in densely populated regions. The same is true for planned vegetation like [[park]]s and [[garden]]s, but restoration plays a particular role, because it reverses previous conversions to [[Built-up area|built]] and agricultural areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5144">[[File:Leafu.jpg|thumb|Leaf Protein Concentrate (Leafu) made from [[stinging nettles]]]]
'''Leaf protein concentrate''' ('''LPC''') is a [[concentration|concentrated]] form of the [[protein]]s found in the [[leaf|leaves]] of plants.  It has been examined as a human or animal food source, because it is potentially the cheapest, most abundant source of available protein.  Although humans can derive some protein from the direct consumption of leaves as [[leaf vegetable]]s, the [[human digestive system]] would not be able to deal with the enormous bulk of leaves needed to meet dietary protein requirements with leaf vegetables alone.

==Application==

LPC was first suggested as a human food in the 1960s, but it has not achieved much success, despite early promise. [[Norman Pirie]] (1971, 1975), the [[Copley Medal]] winner from the UK, reviewed and emphasized the importance of its benefits,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smartsheep.org/norman-wingate-pirie-bibliography-norman-wingate-piriebibliogr-index-16|title=Norman Wingate Pirie Bibliography, p.16|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which brought the subject forward. The increasing reliance on [[feedlot]] based animal rearing to satisfy human appetites for meat has increased demand for cheaper vegetable protein sources. This has recently led to renewed interest in LPC to reduce the use of human-edible vegetable protein sources in animal feed.

==Health issues==

Leaf protein is a good source of [[amino acid]]s, with [[methionine]] being a limiting factor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hussein|first=Laila|last2=El-Fouly|first2=Mohamed|last3=El-Baz|first3=F.

==Methods of production==

Generally, LPC is produced by pulping leaves and pressing the juice out, heating the juice to coagulate the protein, and filtering the protein out and drying it.

'''Loudness monitoring''' of [[programme levels]] is needed in [[radio]] and [[television]] [[broadcasting]], as well as in [[audio post production]]. Traditional methods of measuring signal levels, such as the [[Peak programme meter]] and [[VU meter]], do not give the subjectively valid measure of [[loudness]] that many would argue is needed to optimise the listening experience when changing channels or swapping disks.

The need for proper loudness monitoring is apparent in the [[loudness war]] that is now found everywhere in the audio field, and the extreme compression that is now applied to [[programme levels]].

==Loudness meters==
Meters have been introduced that aim to measure the human perceived loudness by taking account of the [[equal-loudness contours]] and other factors, such as audio spectrum, duration, compression and intensity. One such device was developed by [[CBS Laboratories]] in the 1980s. Complaints to broadcasters about the intrusive level of interstitials programs (advertisements, commercials) has resulted in projects to develop such meters. Based on loudness metering, many manufacturers have developed real-time audio processors that adjust the audio signal to match a specified target loudness level that preserves volume consistency at home listeners.

==EBU Mode meters==
In August 2010, the European Broadcasting Union published a new metering specification [http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3341.pdf EBU Tech 3341], which builds on [[ITU-R BS.1770]]. To make sure meters from different manufacturers provide the same reading in [[LUFS]] units, [http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3341.pdf EBU Tech 3341] specifies the 'EBU Mode', which includes a Momentary (400 ms), Short term (3s) and Integrated (from start to stop) meter and a [http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/testmaterial/ebu-loudness-test-setv03.zip set of audiosignals] to test the meters.

[[File:Marconi Tower at Sunset.jpg|thumb|right|Marconi Research Centre]]

'''Marconi Research Centre''' is the former name of the current '''[[BAE Systems]] Applied Intelligence Laboratories''' facility at [[Great Baddow]] in [[Essex]], United Kingdom. Under its earlier name, research at this site spanned military and civilian technology covering the full range of products offered by [[GEC-Marconi]], including [[radio]], [[radar]], [[telecommunications]], [[mechatronics]] and [[microelectronics]].

==Origins==
[[Marconi Company]] chose to establish itself in Chelmsford shortly after the company was founded in 1897. It first acquired the former silk-works on Hall Street before expanding to a new factory, the [[New Street Works]], in 1912. At the same time a formal Research Department was founded under the auspices of [[Charles Samuel Franklin]] near the original Hall Street works.&lt;ref name="MRH"&gt;{{cite web|last1=David|first1=Speake|title=A Historical Survey of the Marconi Research Centre|url=http://marconiradarhistory.pbworks.com/w/page/35808533/David%20Speake|website=marconiradarhistory.pbworks.com|publisher=Marconi Radar History|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The facilities were placed under the direction of the [[Admiralty]] at the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. When the Marconi Company resumed control in 1919, it was two years before the Research Department was reconstituted under [[H. J. Round]], who had previously worked for Franklin, with a separate research team now formed under Franklin himself. [[Thomas Eckersley]] started working for Marconi at this time.&lt;ref name="MRH"/&gt;

By 1924 the Marconi Company had developed short wave radio technology sufficiently to be awarded a contract from the [[Post Office]] to run elements of the [[Imperial Wireless Chain]].&lt;ref name="MRH"/&gt; Further research groups were developed, including one working on [[television]]. In 1936 it was decided to bring together the various radio, television and telephony research teams in a single location. A site was bought in [[Great Baddow]] because it was deemed sufficiently far from potential sources of electrical interference for all research work to be carried out without problems. Building work began in 1937 and by 1938 researchers started working at the site.&lt;ref name="MRH"/&gt;

==Pre-war activity==
The new facilities were placed under the direction J. G. Robb. Research under his direction was varied, including a telephone laboratory focusing on audio research, propagation, low noise receivers, [[direction finding|radio direction finding]] and television. A specialist component group developed quartz crystals and gas discharge devices.&lt;ref name="MRH"/&gt;

==Second World War and its aftermath==
In April 1940 the [[Royal Air Force]] took charge of the team around Eckersley dealing with [[Radio propagation]]. By August 1941, with the [[Admiralty Signal Establishment]] set up, the rest of the laboratories were taken over by the [[admiralty]].

When the UK electronics industry developed during the 1940s and 1950s, the campus expanded to include research into radar, general physics, high voltage, vacuum physics and semiconductors. At its peak the Centre employed more than 1,200 engineers, technicians, craftsmen and support staff.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} It was also home to the [[Marconi Company]]'s museum containing numerous original artifacts from the pioneering period of [[Guglielmo Marconi]]'s work on [[wireless telegraphy]].&lt;ref&gt;''The emergence of broadcasting in Britain'', Brian Hennessy, John Hennessy, {{ISBN|0-9551408-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Mathematical Institute''' is the [[mathematics]] department at the [[University of Oxford]], England. It forms one of the twelve departments of the [[Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division, University of Oxford|Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division]] in the University. The department is located between [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]] and [[Green Templeton College, Oxford|Green Templeton College]] on [[Woodstock Road, Oxford|Woodstock Road]], next to the [[Faculty of Philosophy, University of Oxford|Faculty of Philosophy]].

==Overview==
The Oxford Mathematical Institute includes both pure and applied mathematics (Statistics is a separate department) and is one of the largest and most respected mathematics departments in the UK with about 100 faculty members, and was ranked as the top mathematics department in the UK in the 2014 UK Research Evaluation Framework.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/sites/default/files/Attachments/2014/12/17/g/o/l/sub-14-01.pdf Research Excellence Framework 2014 ranking]&lt;/ref&gt; Research at the Mathematical Institute covers all branches of mathematical sciences ranging from, for example, algebra, number theory, and geometry to the application of mathematics to a wide range of fields including industry, finance, climate modelling, networks and the brain. It has over 850 undergraduates, over 250 postgraduates and around 150 MSc students. 

==History==
[[File:Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford.jpg|thumb|Former Mathematical Institute building, built in 1966.]]
The first Mathematical Institute was built in 1966 and was located at the northern end of [[St Giles' Street, Oxford|St Giles']] near the junction with [[Banbury Road]] in central north [[Oxford]]. The building of an institute was originally proposed by [[G.H. Hardy]] at least 30 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/bshm/zingaz/OxfordPeople.html The British Society for the History of Mathematics Gazetteer], [[University of Warwick]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Institute had two annexes: one in Dartington House, on [[Little Clarendon Street]], and the other in the Gibson Building, on the site of the [[Radcliffe Infirmary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/about-us About], Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of [[Michaelmas term]] 2013 Oxford Mathematics has been unified and is now housed in the purpose-built [[Andrew Wiles]] Building in the [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] in [[North Oxford]], near the original Radcliffe Infirmary. Wiles, the Regius Professor of Mathematics at the university, is known for proving [[Fermat's Last Theorem]].&lt;ref name="Short History"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www1.maths.ox.ac.uk/system/files/attachments/OxfordMathematics_ROQ_leaflet.pdf|title=The Andrew Wiles Builkding - a Short History|publisher=maths.ox.ac.uk |accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[Arthur Evans]] developed a relative dating scheme of '''Minoan chronology''' based on the excavations initiated and managed by him at the site of the ancient city of [[Knossos]]. He called the civilization that he discovered there [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]. The same scheme was later applied to the [[Greece|Greek]] mainland and the [[Cyclades]] Islands to form a general plan for dating events of the prehistoric and early historic [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]]. The relative chronology is based on the shapes and decorative styles of [[Minoan pottery]] found at many sites on [[Crete]] and elsewhere.

==Evans and Knossos==
[[Arthur Evans]] began excavating on a hill called ''tou tseleve he [[kephala]]'', "the headland of the chieftain", some three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) from the north coast of [[Crete]], on March 23, 1900. Two of the palace storerooms had been uncovered by Minos Kalokairinos in 1878, whose work ceased at the demand of the land owners. Simultaneously, coins and [[Seal (device)|seal]]s inscribed with a mysterious script were also discovered. These came to Evans' attention as the curator of the [[Ashmolean Museum]] at [[Oxford]], a position he held from 1884 to 1908. The area was rumored to have been the site of the ancient city of [[Knossos]].

Evans examined the site on March 19, 1894. Nothing further could be done at that time, but in 1898 Crete became an independent republic. In 1899 Evans purchased the land with his own funds (his family had been factory owners in industrial Britain) and decided to set up an excavation. In the first two weeks he discovered the [[Linear A]] tablets, a streak of luck exceeded only by [[Carl Blegen]]'s legendary first day's dig at [[Pylos]], when he uncovered the Pylos tablets, written in [[Linear B]], a script also found at Kephala and named by Evans.

[[File:Palace of Knossus.jpg|thumb|right|The palace]]
[[File:Knossos Rekonstruktion.jpg|thumb|right|Another view of the palace]]
Attacking the site with crews of hundreds of diggers, Evans uncovered most of the site's {{convert|6|acre|m2}} within 6 seasons. By 1905 he had named the civilization whose traces he found there ''Minoan'', after the legendary king [[Minos]], and had created a detailed chronology of the serial phases of the pottery styles in Minoan Crete, based on what he found at [[Knossos]]. Subsequently he concerned himself mainly with restoration, an activity frowned upon by archaeologists of today. He continued to excavate there and elsewhere and to restore&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webfea-lb.fea.aub.edu.lb/arch121/Aegean%20Art/page4.htm |title=Page 4 |publisher=Webfea-lb.fea.aub.edu.lb |date= |accessdate=2012-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 1935.

Evans was knighted in 1911 for his work. In 1921, the first edition of his monumental work, ''Palace of Minos'', was released, which became indispensable for any department of classical archaeology. On Evans' death in 1941, the British School of Archaeology assumed responsibility for the excavation, later turning the property over to the Greek government, while retaining excavation rights.

==Evans' chronology==
Evans' chronological framework had triple divisions each triply divided, a formula that has been retained, thus Early Minoan (EM) I, II and III, Middle Minoan (MM) I, II and III etc. Each subsection he divided into A and B, early and late. In 1918 [[Alan Wace|Alan J. B. Wace]] and [[Carl Blegen]] adapted Evans' chronology to the Greek mainland and the islands, where the culture was termed [[Helladic]] and [[Cycladic]]. In 1941 [[Arne Furumark]] applied the term Mycenaean to LH and LC. As it is clear that the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greeks]] dominated at Knossos at some point in Late Minoan (LM), the latter is often included under "Mycenaean" or called "Minoan-Mycenaean".
&lt;!---bunko: Usefully conceptualized in this artificially rigid serial organization, actual ceramics show blends of styles, either attesting gradual shifts in style or the conservative instincts of apprenticeship-trained potters and their patrons.--&gt;

The major study of Cretan pottery was Evans'. A very general stylistic trend was from dark decoration on a light background in the Early Minoan to white and red decorations on a dark wash or [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]] in Middle Minoan. Finally, there was a return to the earlier manner of [[dark on light]] in Late Minoan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sinclair Hood]], ''The Home of the Heroes: The Aegean before the Greeks'', 1975, {{ISBN|0-500-29009-1}}, Chapter 3, ''Dating the Bronze Age''.&lt;/ref&gt; New body shapes for vessels also emerged and various styles of decoration are evident within Evans' chronology.

Evans never intended to give exact calendrical dates to the pottery periods. He did correlate them roughly&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061206131707/http://oi.uchicago.edu/OI/DEPT/RA/HJK/HJKX.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt; to better dated Egyptian periods using finds of Egyptian artifacts in association with Cretan ones and obvious similarities of some types of Cretan artifacts with Egyptian ones. Subsequent investigators checking Evans' work varied the dates of some of the periods a little, usually less than a few hundred years, but the chronological structure remains basically as Evans left it, a solid framework for placing events of Aegean prehistory.

Most criticism does not aim at the overthrow of Evans' system, but only complains that it does not capture all the data, such as local variations. Even with these faults the system has no competitors. In 1958 [[Nikolaos Platon]] proposed a new chronology at the Prehistoric Conference in Hamburg. In it, the terms "Pre-palace", "Old Palace" and "New Palace" were to replace Evans' scheme. The academic community accepted the scheme but not the replacement, simply stating where in Evans' system the new terms fit.

The one serious question&lt;ref&gt;There are many questions, of course, but this one persists and would overthrow an important part of Evans' chronology. A brief review can be found at the Stanford [http://traumwerk.stanford.edu:3455/Archaeopaedia/123 Archaeopedia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061216052913/http://traumwerk.stanford.edu:3455/Archaeopaedia/123 |date=2006-12-16 }} site.&lt;/ref&gt; concerns the date of the Knossos tablets. Allegations were made that Evans falsified the stratum in which the tablets were found to place the tablets at 1400 BCE when they ought to have been the same date as the Pylos tablets, 1200 BCE. This dispute became known as the [[Palmer-Boardman Dispute]] when it first appeared. Despite the intense debate that developed on the subject no conclusive evidence has yet been found to settle the question. A key part of the case was that a certain kind of vase, a stirrup jar (named from the handles) found in tablet contexts, is dated only to 1200. Other archaeologists hastened to the journalistic scene with instances of similar jars going back to 1400. The search for closure goes on. By default, archaeologists tend to use Evans' dating.

!'''Other names'''
!'''Relative chronology'''&lt;ref&gt;It is well-nigh impossible to peruse several books and articles on Crete and come up with anything like a uniform chronology. The underlying reason is no doubt that the time windows of the artifacts are not uniform. Some sites did not experience the full complement of periods; one period got extended over more than one elsewhere. The dates of the periods are not the same everywhere. The utility of a scheme such as Evans' becomes evident in a context such as this. It might be viewed as a median chronological framework.&lt;/ref&gt;
!'''Conventional dates, BCE'''&lt;ref&gt;The dates given below are a sampling from the noted works listed in the ''References'' section below. Many samples of other noted works might be selected with little likelihood of finding the same dates, but they would tend to vary about Evans' relative chronology. Note also that some of the authors, such as Hutchinson, revised their dates as part of the ongoing process of discovery. Even in different chapters of the same book the reader will find the same period dated differently by the same author.&lt;/ref&gt;

|Palaces were so destroyed by an earthquake ca. 1700 that they had to be rebuilt. This is the dividing line between Old and New Palace and between II and III.&lt;ref&gt;The events of course are not quite so simple. There was more than one earthquake. Old Palace at Knosses seems to have gone on modified until the middle of IIIA. There is some equivocation also about what building activities constitute "old" and "new", as earthquakes in Crete were frequent and rebuilding ongoing. The transition from old to new should not be regarded as any sharp event. The quest for precision goes on.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multi-disciplinary design optimization''' ('''MDO''') is a field of [[engineering]] that uses [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] methods to solve [[design]] problems incorporating a number of disciplines. It is also known as multidisciplinary optimization and multidisciplinary system design optimization (MSDO).

MDO allows designers to incorporate all relevant disciplines simultaneously.  The optimum of the simultaneous problem is superior to the design found by optimizing each discipline sequentially, since it can exploit the interactions between the disciplines.  However, including all disciplines simultaneously significantly increases the [[computational complexity theory|complexity]] of the problem.

These techniques have been used in a number of fields, including [[automobile]] design, [[naval architecture]], [[electronics]], [[architecture]], [[computer]]s, and [[electricity distribution]].  However, the largest number of applications have been in the field of [[aerospace engineering]], such as [[aircraft]] and [[spacecraft]] design.  For example, the proposed [[Boeing]] [[blended wing body]] (BWB) aircraft concept has used MDO extensively in the conceptual and preliminary design stages.  The disciplines considered in the BWB design are [[aerodynamics]], [[structural analysis]], [[Air propulsion|propulsion]], [[control theory]], and [[economics]].

==History==
Traditionally engineering has normally been performed by teams, each with expertise in a specific discipline, such as aerodynamics or structures.  Each team would use its members' experience and judgement to develop a workable design, usually sequentially.  For example, the aerodynamics experts would outline the shape of the body, and the structural experts would be expected to fit their design within the shape specified.  The goals of the teams were generally performance-related, such as maximum speed, minimum [[drag (physics)|drag]], or minimum structural weight.

Between 1970 and 1990, two major developments in the aircraft industry changed the approach of aircraft design engineers to their design problems.  The first was [[computer-aided design]], which allowed designers to quickly modify and analyse their designs.  The second was changes in the procurement policy of most [[airline]]s and military organizations, particularly the [[military of the United States]], from a performance-centred approach to one that emphasized [[Product lifecycle management|lifecycle]] cost issues.  This led to an increased concentration on economic factors and the attributes known as the "[[ilities]]" including [[manufacturability]], [[reliability (engineering)|reliability]], [[maintainability]], etc.

Since 1990, the techniques have expanded to other industries.  Globalization has resulted in more distributed, decentralized design teams.  The high-performance [[personal computer]] has largely replaced the centralized [[supercomputer]] and the [[Internet]] and [[local area network]]s have facilitated sharing of design information. Disciplinary design software in many disciplines (such as [[OptiStruct]] or [[NASTRAN]], a [[finite element analysis]] program for structural design) have become very mature.  In addition, many optimization algorithms, in particular the population-based algorithms, have advanced significantly.

=== Origins in structural optimization ===
Whereas optimization methods are nearly as old as [[calculus]], dating back to [[Isaac Newton]], [[Leonhard Euler]], [[Daniel Bernoulli]], and [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], who used them to solve problems such as the shape of the [[catenary]] curve, numerical optimization reached prominence in the digital age. Its systematic application to structural design dates to its advocacy by Schmit in 1960. The success of structural optimization in the 1970s motivated the emergence of multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) in the 1980s. Jaroslaw Sobieski championed decomposition methods specifically designed for MDO applications. The following synopsis focuses on optimization methods for MDO. First, the popular gradient-based methods used by the early structural optimization and MDO community are reviewed. Then those methods developed in the last dozen years are summarized.

=== Gradient-based methods ===
There were two schools of structural optimization practitioners using [[Gradient|gradient]]-based methods during the 1960s and 1970s: optimality criteria and [[Mathematical optimization|mathematical programming]]. The optimality criteria school derived recursive formulas based on the [[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions|Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) necessary conditions]] for an optimal design. The KKT conditions were applied to classes of structural problems such as minimum weight design with constraints on stresses, displacements, buckling, or frequencies [Rozvany, Berke, Venkayya, Khot, et al.] to derive resizing expressions particular to each class. The mathematical programming school employed classical gradient-based methods to structural optimization problems. The method of usable feasible directions, Rosen’s gradient projection (generalized reduce gradient) method, sequential unconstrained minimization techniques, sequential linear programming and eventually sequential quadratic programming methods were common choices. Schittkowski et al. reviewed the methods current by the early 1990s.

The gradient methods unique to the MDO community derive from the combination of optimality criteria with math programming, first recognized in the seminal work of Fleury and Schmit who constructed a framework of approximation concepts for structural optimization. They recognized that optimality criteria were so successful for stress and displacement constraints, because that approach amounted to solving the dual problem for [[Lagrange multipliers]] using linear Taylor series approximations in the reciprocal design space. In combination with other techniques to improve efficiency, such as constraint deletion, regionalization, and design variable linking, they succeeded in uniting the work of both schools. This approximation concepts based approach forms the basis of the optimization modules in modern structural design software such as Altair – Optistruct, ASTROS, MSC.Nastran, PHX [[ModelCenter]], Genesis, iSight, and I-DEAS.

Approximations for structural optimization were initiated by the reciprocal approximation Schmit and Miura for stress and displacement response functions. Other intermediate variables were employed for plates. Combining linear and reciprocal variables, Starnes and Haftka developed a conservative approximation to improve buckling approximations. Fadel chose an appropriate intermediate design variable for each function based on a gradient matching condition for the previous point. Vanderplaats initiated a second generation of high quality approximations when he developed the force approximation as an intermediate response approximation to improve the approximation of stress constraints. Canfield developed a [[Rayleigh quotient]] approximation to improve the accuracy of eigenvalue approximations. Barthelemy and Haftka published a comprehensive review of approximations in 1993.

=== Non-gradient-based methods  ===
In recent years, non-gradient-based evolutionary methods including [[Genetic algorithm|genetic algorithms]], [[Simulated annealing|simulated annealing]], and [[Ant colony optimization algorithms|ant colony algorithms]] came into existence. At present, many researchers are striving to arrive at a consensus regarding the best modes and methods for complex problems like impact damage, dynamic failure, and [[Real-time analyzer|real-time analyses]]. For this purpose, researchers often employ multiobjective and multicriteria design methods.

=== Recent MDO methods ===
MDO practitioners have investigated [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] methods in several broad areas in the last dozen years. These include decomposition methods, [[approximation]] methods, [[evolutionary algorithm]]s, [[memetic algorithm]]s, [[response surface methodology]], reliability-based optimization, and [[multi-objective optimization]] approaches.

The exploration of decomposition methods has continued in the last dozen years with the development and comparison of a number of approaches, classified variously as hierarchic and non hierarchic, or collaborative and non collaborative. 
Approximation methods spanned a diverse set of approaches, including the development of approximations based on [[surrogate model]]s (often referred to as metamodels), variable fidelity models, and trust region management strategies. The development of multipoint approximations blurred the distinction with response surface methods. Some of the most popular methods include [[Kriging]] and the [[moving least squares]] method.

[[Response surface methodology]], developed extensively by the statistical community, received much attention in the MDO community in the last dozen years. A driving force for their use has been the development of massively parallel systems for high performance computing, which are naturally suited to distributing the function evaluations from multiple disciplines that are required for the construction of response surfaces. Distributed processing is particularly suited to the design process of complex systems in which analysis of different disciplines may be accomplished naturally on different computing platforms and even by different teams.

Evolutionary methods led the way in the exploration of non-gradient methods for MDO applications. They also have benefited from the availability of massively parallel high performance computers, since they inherently require many more function evaluations than gradient-based methods. Their primary benefit lies in their ability to handle discrete design variables and the potential to find globally optimal solutions.

Reliability-based optimization (RBO) is a growing area of interest in MDO. Like response surface methods and evolutionary algorithms, RBO benefits from parallel computation, because the numeric integration to calculate the probability of failure requires many function evaluations. One of the first approaches employed approximation concepts to integrate the probability of failure. The classical first-order reliability method (FORM) and second-order reliability method (SORM) are still popular. Professor Ramana Grandhi used appropriate normalized variables about the most probable point of failure, found by a two-point adaptive nonlinear approximation to improve the accuracy and efficiency. [[Southwest Research Institute]] has figured prominently in the development of RBO, implementing state-of-the-art reliability methods in commercial software. RBO has reached sufficient maturity to appear in commercial structural analysis programs like Altair's [[OptiStruct|Optistruct]] and MSC's [[Nastran]].

Utility-based probability maximization (Bordley and Pollock, Operations Research, Sept, 2009, pg.1262) was developed in response to some logical concerns (e.g., Blau's Dilemma) with reliability-based design optimization. This approach focuses on maximizing the joint probability of both the objective function exceeding some value and of all the constraints being satisfied.  When there is no objective function, utility-based probability maximization reduces to a probability-maximization problem.   When there are no uncertainties in the constraints, it reduces to a constrained utility-maximization problem.  (This second equivalence arises because the utility of a function can always be written as the probability of that function exceeding some random variable.)   Because it changes the constrained optimization problem associated with reliability-based optimization into an unconstrained optimization problem, it often leads to computationally more tractable problem formulations.

In the marketing field there is a huge literature about optimal design for multiattribute products and services, based on experimental analysis to estimate models of consumers' utility functions. These methods are known as [[Conjoint analysis|Conjoint Analysis]]. Respondents are presented with alternative products, measuring preferences about the alternatives using a variety of scales and the utility function is estimated with different methods (varying from regression and surface response methods to choice models). The best design is formulated after estimating the model. The experimental design is usually optimized to minimize the variance of the estimators. These methods are widely used in practice.

==Problem formulation==

Problem formulation is normally the most difficult part of the process.  It is the selection of design variables, constraints, objectives, and models of the disciplines.  A further consideration is the strength and breadth of the interdisciplinary coupling in the problem.

===Design variables===

A design variable is a specification that is controllable from the point of view of the designer.  For instance, the thickness of a structural member can be considered a design variable.  Another might be the choice of material.  Design variables can be continuous (such as a wing span), discrete (such as the number of ribs in a wing), or boolean (such as whether to build a monoplane or a [[biplane]]).  Design problems with continuous variables are normally solved more easily.

Design variables are often bounded, that is, they often have maximum and minimum values.  Depending on the solution method, these bounds can be treated as constraints or separately.

One of the important variables that needs to be accounted is an uncertainty. Uncertainty, often referred to as epistemic uncertainty, arises due to lack of knowledge or incomplete information. Uncertainty is essentially unknown variable but it may causes the failure of system.

===Constraints===

A constraint is a condition that must be satisfied in order for the design to be feasible.  An example of a constraint in aircraft design is that the [[lift (force)|lift]] generated by a wing must be equal to the weight of the aircraft.  In addition to physical laws, constraints can reflect resource limitations, user requirements, or bounds on the validity of the analysis models.  Constraints can be used explicitly by the solution algorithm or can be incorporated into the objective using [[Lagrange multiplier]]s.

===Objectives===

An objective is a numerical value that is to be maximized or minimized.  For example, a designer may wish to maximize profit or minimize weight.  Many solution methods work only with single objectives.  When using these methods, the designer normally weights the various objectives and sums them to form a single objective.  Other methods allow multiobjective optimization, such as the calculation of a [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto front]].

===Models===

The designer must also choose models to relate the constraints and the objectives to the design variables.  These models are dependent on the discipline involved.  They may be empirical models, such as a [[regression analysis]] of aircraft prices, theoretical models, such as from [[computational fluid dynamics]], or reduced-order models of either of these.  In choosing the models the designer must trade off fidelity with analysis time.

The multidisciplinary nature of most design problems complicates model choice and implementation.  Often several iterations are necessary between the disciplines in order to find the values of the objectives and constraints.  As an example, the aerodynamic loads on a wing affect the structural deformation of the wing.  The structural deformation in turn changes the shape of the wing and the aerodynamic loads.  Therefore, in analysing a wing, the aerodynamic and structural analyses must be run a number of times in turn until the loads and deformation converge.

===Standard form===

Once the design variables, constraints, objectives, and the relationships between them have been chosen, the problem can be expressed in the following form:

: find &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;  that minimizes &lt;math&gt;J(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; subject to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{x})\leq\mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{h}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_{lb}\leq \mathbf{x} \leq \mathbf{x}_{ub} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is an objective, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] of design variables, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of inequality constraints, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{h}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of equality constraints, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_{lb}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_{ub}&lt;/math&gt; are vectors of lower and upper bounds on the design variables.  Maximization problems can be converted to minimization problems by multiplying the objective by -1.  Constraints can be reversed in a similar manner.  Equality constraints can be replaced by two inequality constraints.

==Problem solution==

The problem is normally solved using appropriate techniques from the field of optimization.  These include [[gradient]]-based algorithms, population-based algorithms, or others.  Very simple problems can sometimes be expressed linearly; in that case the techniques of [[linear programming]] are applicable.

===Gradient-based methods===
*[[Adjoint equation]]
*[[Newton's method]]
*[[Steepest descent]]
*[[Conjugate gradient]]
*[[Sequential quadratic programming]]

===Gradient-free methods===
* Hooke-Jeeves pattern search
* [[Nelder-Mead method]]

===Population-based methods===
*[[Genetic algorithm]]
*[[Memetic algorithm]]
*[[Particle swarm optimization]]
*[[Harmony search]]
*ODMA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00500-014-1536-x|title=ODMA: a novel swarm-evolutionary metaheuristic optimizer inspired by open source development model and communities|author1=Hossein Hajipour|author2=Hamed Behzadi Khormuji|author3=Habib Rostami|doi=10.1007/s00500-014-1536-x|journal=Soft Comput|year=2016|volume=20|page=727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other methods===
*Random search
*[[Grid search]]
*[[Simulated annealing]]
*[[Brute-force search|Direct search]]
*[[IOSO]] (Indirect Optimization based on Self-Organization)

Most of these techniques require large numbers of evaluations of the objectives and the constraints.  The disciplinary models are often very complex and can take significant amounts of time for a single evaluation.  The solution can therefore be extremely time-consuming.  Many of the optimization techniques are adaptable to [[parallel computing]].  Much current research is focused on methods of decreasing the required time.

Also, no existing solution method is guaranteed to find the [[global optimization|global optimum]] of a general problem (see [[No free lunch in search and optimization]]). Gradient-based methods find local optima with high reliability but are normally unable to escape a local optimum.  Stochastic methods, like simulated annealing and genetic algorithms, will find a good solution with high probability, but very little can be said about the mathematical properties of the solution.  It is not guaranteed to even be a local optimum.  These methods often find a different design each time they are run.

A '''''{{Lang|de|Musikalisches Würfelspiel}}''''' (German for "musical dice game") was a system for using [[dice]] to randomly '[[generative music|generate]]' [[music]] from [[music composition|precomposed]] options. These 'games' were quite popular throughout Western Europe in the 18th century. Several different [[game]]s were devised, some that did not require dice, but merely 'choosing a [[random]] [[number]].'

The earliest example is [[Johann Philipp Kirnberger]]'s ''{{Lang|de|Der allezeit fertige Menuetten- und Polonaisencomponist}}'' (German for "The Ever-Ready Minuet and Polonaise Composer") (1757 [1st edition; revised 2nd 1783]).&lt;ref name="Algorithmic"&gt;Nierhaus, Gerhard (2009). ''Algorithmic Composition: Paradigms of Automated Music Generation'', pp. 36 &amp; 38n7. {{ISBN|9783211755396}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples by well known composers include [[C. P. E. Bach]]'s ''{{Lang|de|Einfall, einen doppelten Contrapunct in der Octave von sechs Tacten zu machen, ohne die Regeln davon zu wissen}}'' (German for "A method for making six bars of double counterpoint at the octave without knowing the rules") (1758) and [[Maximilian Stadler]]'s ''{{Lang|fr|Table pour composer des minuets et des Trios à la infinie; avec deux dez à jouer}}'' (French for "A table for composing minuets and trios to infinity, by playing with two dice") (1780).&lt;ref name="Algorithmic" /&gt;

In the early 20th century the Kaleidacousticon System, using arbitrarily combinable [[playing card]]s, was unsuccessfully marketed in the Boston area as a [[parlour game]].&lt;ref&gt;Nierhaus (2009), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetics==
According to Lawrence Zbikowski, "In truth, chance played little part in the success of the music produced by such games. Instead, what was required of the compilers...[was] a little knowledge about how to put the game together and an understanding of the formal design of waltzes, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Zbikowski, Lawrence M. (2002). ''Conceptualizing Music: Cognitive Structure, Theory, and Analysis'', pp. 142–143. {{ISBN|9780195187977}}. Quoted in Berkowitz, Aaron (2010). ''The Improvising Mind: Cognition and Creativity in the Musical Moment'', p. 65. {{ISBN|9780199590957}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Stephen Hedges, "The 'galant' middle class in Europe was playing with mathematics. In this atmosphere of investigation and cataloguing, a systematic device that would seem to make it possible for anyone to write music was practically guaranteed popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Hedges, Stephen A. (1978). "Dice Music in the Eighteenth Century", pp. 184–185, ''Music and Letters 59'': 180–87. Quoted in Berkowitz (2010), p. 65n60.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Leonard Meyer]], "Eighteenth-century composers constructed musical dice games while nineteenth century composers did not. ... [W]hat constrained the choice of figures [in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century music] were the claims of taste, coherent expression and propriety, given the genre of work being composed, rather than the inner necessity of a gradually unfolding, underlying process [as in nineteenth century music]".&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Leonard (1989). ''Style and Music: Theory, History, and Ideology'', p. 193. {{ISBN|9780226521527}}.&lt;/ref&gt; See: [[musical development]].

The way these games work may be understood in analogy to [[generative grammar|sentence construction]].
 1 The cow   ran    past    the field.
 2 The pig   walked through the yard.
 3 The sheep ran    into    the marsh.
One rolls one&lt;!--three sided--&gt; die for each word and selects the word from the appropriate column according to the number. Thus if one rolls 1 2 3 1 2 3 one is given, "The pig ran past the marsh." Each progression is essentially the same, there may be more or less choices for different slots, and the choices offered for each slot are slight [[variation (music)|variations]] rather than being entirely different.

== Alleged musikalisches Würfelspiel ==

The most well-known was published in 1792, by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s publisher [[Nikolaus Simrock]] in Berlin ([[Köchel catalogue|K.]] 294d or K. Anh. C 30.01). The game was attributed to Mozart, but this attribution has not been authenticated.&lt;ref&gt;Cope, David (1996). ''Experiments in Musical Intelligence'', p. 7. Madison, Wisconsin: A–R Editions, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0895793379}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The dice rolls randomly selected small sections of music, which would be patched together to create a musical piece. This game is capable of producing 11&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;45,949,729,863,572,161 different yet similar waltzes.&lt;ref&gt;Zbikowski (2002), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Some measures have only one possibility no matter what the roll of the dice (measure 8/16) while other measures have a different possibility for each roll (measure 1/16).&lt;ref&gt;Berkowitz (2010), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mozart's manuscript K. 516f, written in 1787, consisting of numerous two-[[bar (music)|bar]] fragments of music, appears to be some kind of game or system for constructing music out of two-bar fragments, but contains no instructions and there is no evidence that dice were involved.

The titles of the supposed Mozart compositions are:&lt;ref name="Algorithmic" /&gt;
*''{{Lang|de|Anleitung zum Componieren von Walzern so viele man will vermittelst zweier Würfel, ohne etwas von der Musik oder Composition zu verstehen}}'' (German for "Instructions for the composition of as many waltzes as one desires with two dice, without understanding anything about music or composition")
*''{{Lang|de|Anleitung zum Componieren von Polonaisen...}}'' (German for "Instructions for the composition of polonaises...")

[[Robert Xavier Rodríguez]] composed his ''Musical Dice Game'' for string orchestra based on K. 516f.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.schirmer.com/default.aspx?tabid=2420&amp;state_2874=2&amp;workid_2874=25473 Robert Xavier Rodríguez: Musical Dice Game]", Schirmer.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The attribution of [[Joseph Haydn]]'s ''{{Lang|it|Gioco filarmonico o sia maniera facile per comporre un infinito numero de minuetti e trio anche senza sapere il contrappunto}}'' (Italian for "The game of harmony, or an easy method for composing an infinite number of minuet-trios, without any knowledge of counterpoint") has also not been authenticated.&lt;ref name="Algorithmic" /&gt;

The '''National Cryptologic School''' ('''NCS''') is a school within the [[National Security Agency]] that provides  training to members of the Agency.

The National Cryptologic School is a Cryptologic Training School within the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). It is responsible for designing, developing, and delivering curriculum in [[Cryptology]], [[Information Assurance]], Language, and Leadership.

It was opened on November 1, 1965, and is now housed on multiple campuses, including the NSA's [[Friendship Annex]] facility in [[Linthicum, Maryland|Linthicum]], [[Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bamford |first=James |authorlink=James Bamford |title=The Puzzle Palace: A Report on America's Most Secret Agency |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=1983 |page=153 |isbn=9780140067484}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Career Development |publisher=National Security Agency |date=February 23, 2009 |url=http://www.nsa.gov/careers/career_dev/ |accessdate=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NCS courses are provided to the civilian and military population of the NSA, as well as the [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community]], the military services, and the [[Central Security Service]] (CSS). Many of the courses are accredited by the [[American Council on Education]] and the [[Council on Occupational Education]], and are eligible for transfer credits at a variety of educational institutions.

Training is delivered via computer-based methods, as well as in the traditional classroom setting. Employees have access to thousands of web-based training courses developed by NSA, as well as those offered by a variety of vendors and agencies throughout the Intelligence Community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3760">'''Online music education''' is a recent development in the field of [[music education]] consisting of the application of new technologies associated with [[distance learning]] and [[online education]] for the purpose of teaching and learning music in an [[online]] environment mediated by [[computers]] and the [[internet]].

The origins of online music education may be traced to the use of technologies to supplement face-to-face learning in traditional classroom settings, however in recent years it has expanded to include the offering of entire degree programs – even [[doctoral degree]]s – online.  

The rise of technologies leading to the development of online music education is well documented, and  such studies have become particularly popular in the United States in recent years (Schlager, 2008; Webster, 2007). Salavuo (2006) has examined the recent popularization of informal engagement with music technology in online social networks, which may embody a form of informal community music education. The potential of online music education to create positive change in terms of professional development has been noted by various scholars (Hebert, 2008; Sherbon &amp; Kish, 2005); However, concerns have also been raised regarding the absence of a sufficient research base concerning the effectiveness of online music education (Hebert, 2007; Webster, 2007). It is likely that more studies will be seen in this high-growth area in the coming years.

== Institutions offering online music education ==
The following is a partial list of North American institutions that offer online degree programs in [[music education]]:

*[[Boston University College of Fine Arts]]
*[[University of Florida College of the Arts]]
*[[University of Georgia]]
*[[Rutgers University]] [[Mason Gross School of the Arts]]
*[[Auburn University]]
*[[Duquesne University]] [[Mary Pappert School of Music]]
*[[Ohio University]]
*[[University of South Florida]]
*[[University of Hawaii at Manoa]]
*[[Kent State University]]
*[[Stephen F. Austin State University]]
*[[University of Southern Mississippi]]
*[[East Carolina University]]

The most common degree offered online in this subject area is a Master of Music, although one institution also offers a [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] degree. As of mid-2008, one institution - Boston University - has over 800 online graduate students in music education.

'''Organic Engineering Systems (OES)''' are organic, [[hydroponic]], [[aeroponic]] or [[aquaponic]] farming technologies that are designed as a building engineering system.  The main purpose of these technologies is to grow food in buildings. OES are agricultural technologies and are considered a sub-section of [[ecological engineering]], primarily because they mimic natural ecosystems to produce food and are defined as [[urban horticulture]].&lt;ref&gt;Bergen, Scott D., Susan M. Bolton, James L. Fridley. (2001). Design Principles for Ecological Engineering.  Ecological Engineering, V.18, 201-210.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parking-guidance-system-outdoor-variable-message-sign_ladot-via-fhwa.jpg|thumb|Variable message sign showing people driving where parking spaces are available.]]

'''Parking guidance and information''' ('''PGI''') systems, or '''car park guidance systems''', present drivers with dynamic information on [[parking]] within controlled areas. The systems combine traffic monitoring, communication, processing and [[variable message sign]] technologies to provide the service.

Modern parking lots utilize a variety of technologies to help motorists find unoccupied parking spaces, [[car location]] when returning to the vehicle and improve their experience.  This includes adaptive lighting [[sensor]]s and parking space indicators (red for occupied, green for available and blue is reserved for the disabled; above every parking space), and [[indoor positioning system]] (IPS).

PGI systems are a product of the worldwide initiative for the development of [[intelligent transportation system]] in [[urban areas]]. PGI systems can assist in the development of safe, efficient and environmentally friendly transportation network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Traffic Advisory Leaflet ITS 4/03| work=Parking Guidance and Information | url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/tpm/tal/its/parkingguidanceandinformation | accessdate = 13 April 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070206041939/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/tpm/tal/its/parkingguidanceandinformation &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 6 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PGI systems are designed to aid in the search for vacant [[parking space]]s by directing drivers to [[car parks]] where occupancy levels are low. The objective is to reduce search time, which in turn reduces [[Traffic congestion|congestion]] on the surrounding roads for other [[traffic]] with related benefits to [[air pollution]] with the ultimate aim of enhancement of the urban area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9387">The '''philosophy of chemistry''' considers the [[methodology]] and underlying assumptions of the [[science]] of [[chemistry]].  It is explored by philosophers, chemists, and philosopher-chemist teams.  For much of its history, [[philosophy of science]] has been dominated by the [[philosophy of physics]], but the [[philosophy|philosophical]] questions that arise from chemistry have received increasing attention since the latter part of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Weisberg"&gt;Weisberg, M. (2001). [http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/why-not-a-philosophy-of-chemistry Why not a philosophy of chemistry?] ''American Scientist.'' Retrieved April 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scerri"&gt;Scerri, E.R., &amp; McIntyre, L. (1997). [http://www.chem.ucla.edu/dept/Faculty/scerri/pdf/Case_for_poc.pdf The case for the philosophy of chemistry.] ''Synthese'', 111: 213–232. Retrieved April 10, 2009 from http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00000254/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundations of chemistry==
Major philosophical questions arise as soon as one attempts to define chemistry and what it studies.  [[Atom]]s and [[molecule]]s are often assumed to be the fundamental units of chemical theory,&lt;ref name="Schummer"&gt;Schummer, Joachim. (2006). Philosophy of science. In ''Encyclopedia of philosophy, second edition.'' New York, NY: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; but traditional descriptions of molecular structure and [[chemical bond]]ing fail to account for the properties of many substances, including [[metallic bond|metals]] and [[Coordination complex#Electronic properties of metal complexes|metal complexes]]&lt;ref name="Gammon"&gt;Ebbing, D., &amp; Gammon, S. (2005). ''General chemistry.'' Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[aromaticity]].&lt;ref name="PLK"&gt;Pavia, D., Lampman, G., &amp; Kriz, G. (2004). ''Organic chemistry, volume 1.'' Mason, OH: Cenage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, chemists frequently use non-existent chemical entities like [[resonance (chemistry)|resonance structures]]&lt;ref name="Gammon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PLK" /&gt; to explain the structure and reactions of different substances; these explanatory tools use the language and graphical representations of molecules to describe the behavior of chemicals and chemical reactions that in reality do not behave as straightforward molecules.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Some chemists and philosophers of chemistry prefer to think of substances, rather than microstructures, as the fundamental units of study in chemistry.  There is not always a one-to-one correspondence between the two methods of classifying substances.&lt;ref name="Schummer" /&gt;  For example, many rocks exist as mineral complexes composed of multiple ions that do not occur in fixed proportions or spatial relationships to one another.&lt;ref name="Gammon" /&gt;

A related philosophical problem is whether chemistry is the study of substances or reactions.&lt;ref name="Schummer" /&gt;  Atoms, even in a solid, are in perpetual motion and under the right conditions many chemicals react spontaneously to form new products.  A variety of environmental variables contribute to a substance's properties, including temperature and pressure, proximity to other molecules and the presence of a magnetic field.&lt;ref name="Schummer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gammon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PLK" /&gt;  As Schummer puts it, "Substance philosophers define a chemical reaction by the change of certain substances, whereas process philosophers define a substance by its characteristic chemical reactions."&lt;ref name="Schummer" /&gt;

Philosophers of chemistry discuss issues of [[symmetry]] and [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]] in nature. [[organic chemistry|Organic]] (i.e., [[carbon]]-based) [[molecule]]s are those most often chiral. [[Amino acid]]s, [[nucleic acid]]s and [[sugar]]s, all of which are found exclusively as a single [[enantiomer]] in organisms, are the basic chemical units of [[life]]. [[Chemists]], [[biochemistry|biochemists]], and [[biologists]] alike debate the origins of this [[homochirality]]. Philosophers debate facts regarding the origin of this phenomenon, namely whether it emerged contingently, amid a lifeless [[racemic]] environment or if other processes were at play. Some speculate that answers can only be found in comparison to [[extraterrestrial life]], if it is ever found. Other philosophers question whether there exists a bias toward assumptions of nature as symmetrical, thereby causing resistance to any evidence to the contrary.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

One of the most topical issues is determining to what extent physics, specifically, quantum mechanics, explains chemical phenomena. Can chemistry, in fact, be reduced to physics as has been assumed by many, or are there inexplicable gaps? Some authors, for example, [[Roald Hoffmann]],&lt;ref&gt;The Same and Not the Same (Columbia, 1995, pp. 19-20)&lt;/ref&gt; have recently suggested that a number of difficulties exist in the reductionist program with concepts like aromaticity, pH, reactivity, nucleophilicity, for example. The noted philosopher of science, [[Karl Popper]], among others, predicted as much.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Philosophers of chemistry==
Several [[philosophers]] and [[scientists]] have focused on the philosophy of chemistry in recent years, notably, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] philosopher [[Jaap van Brakel]], who wrote ''The Philosophy of Chemistry'' in 2000, and the [[Malta|Maltese]] philosopher-chemist [[Eric Scerri]], editor of the journal "Foundations of Chemistry" and author of ''Normative and Descriptive Philosophy of Science and the Role of Chemistry in Philosophy of Chemistry'', 2004, among other articles.  Scerri is especially interested in the philosophical foundations of the [[periodic table]], and how physics and chemistry intersect in relation to it, which he contends is not merely a matter for science, but for philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Scerri
| first = Eric R. | authorlink = | coauthors =

| year = 2008 | location = London
| pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-1-84816-137-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although in other fields of science students of the method are generally not practitioners in the field, in chemistry (particularly in synthetic organic chemistry) intellectual method and philosophical foundations are often explored by investigators with active research programmes.  [[Elias James Corey]] developed the concept of "[[retrosynthesis]]" published a seminal work "The logic of chemical synthesis" which deconstructs these thought processes and speculates on computer-assisted synthesis.  Other chemists such as [[K. C. Nicolaou]] (co-author of ''Classics in Total Synthesis'') have followed in his lead.

'''Roderick Arthur William Rhodes''' (born 15 August 1944),&lt;ref name=Congress&gt;{{cite web |title= Rhodes, R. A. W. |url= http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n81117072.html |publisher= Library of Congress |accessdate= 20 September 2014 |quote= (R.A.W. Rhodes, Univ. of Essex) data sheet (b. 8-15-44) ... (Rhodes, Roderick Arthur William) }}&lt;/ref&gt; usually cited as '''R. A. W. Rhodes''', is a British [[Professor]] of [[Political Science]]. 

Rod Rhodes is Professor of Government at the [[University of Southampton]] (UK) and Director of the Centre for Political Ethnography. He is also Emeritus Professor of Politics at the University of Newcastle (UK); Visiting Professor, Utrecht School of Governance, University of Utrecht, The Netherlands; and Adjunct Professor, Centre for Governance and Public Policy, Griffith University, Queensland, Australia. Previously, he was: Professor of Government at [[Griffith University]] (2012-2015); Director of the UK [[Economic and Social Research Council]]’s ‘Whitehall Programme’ (1994-1999); Distinguished Professor of Political Science at the [[Australian National University]] (2006-11); and Director of the Research School of Social Sciences at the [[Australian National University]] (2007-8). He is a life Vice-President and former Chair and President of the [[Political Studies Association]] of the United Kingdom; a Fellow of both the [[Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia]]; and the [[Academy of Social Sciences]] (UK). He has also been a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Arts]], editor of 'Public Administration: an international quarterly' from 1986 to 2011, and Treasurer of the Australian Political Studies Association, 2004-2011. 

== Early life and education ==
Rhodes was born in [[Bradford]] in the West Riding of [[Yorkshire]]. He was educated at a Moravian church school before working as a clerk. After studying at night school, he took a [[bachelor's degree]] at [[Bradford University]]. He also holds a postgraduate BLitt from [[Oxford University]] and a [[doctorate]] from [[Essex University]].  He emigrated from the [[United Kingdom|UK]] to [[Australia]] in 2003, returning to the UK in 2012. 

== Research ==
Rhodes was influential in developing several ideas in present-day political science.

===Differentiated polity===
The idea that British government should be seen as a fragmented or differentiated polity rather than a unitary state has been hugely influential and widely debated. The idea ‘may be becoming the new orthodoxy’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Marsh | first = David | author-link = David Marsh (political scientist) | title = What is at stake? A response to Bevir and Rhodes | journal = The British Journal of Politics &amp; International Relations | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | page = 738 | publisher = Wiley | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-856X.2008.00341.x | date = November 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-856X.2008.00341.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rhodes | first = R. A. W. | title = Beyond Westminster and Whitehall: the sub-central governments of Britain | publisher = Unwin Hyman Allen &amp; Unwin | location = London Winchester, Massachusetts, USA | year = 1988 | isbn = 9780043522226 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Core executive===
With [[Patrick Dunleavy]], Rhodes argued the conventional debate about the British executive, with its focus on the relative power of the prime minister and cabinet was too limited. The core functions of the British executive are to pull together and integrate central government policies and to act as final arbiters of conflicts between different elements of the government machine. These functions can be carried out by institutions other than prime minister and cabinet; for example, the Treasury and the Cabinet Office. By defining the core executive in functional terms, the key questions become: ‘who does what?’ and ‘who has what resources?’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rhodes | first1 = R. A. W. | last2 = Dunleavy | first2 = Patrick | author-link2 = Patrick Dunleavy | title = Prime minister, cabinet, and core executive | publisher = St. Martin's Press | location = New York | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780333555286 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policy networks===
Rhodes pioneered the analysis of policy networks in British government. The term refers to sets of formal and informal institutional linkages between governmental and other actors structured around shared interests in public policymaking and implementation. These institutions are interdependent. Policies emerge from the bargaining between the networks’ members. The other actors commonly include the professions, trade unions and big business. Central departments need their co-operation because British government rarely delivers services itself. It uses other bodies. Also, there are too many groups to consult so government must aggregate interests. It needs the ‘legitimated’ spokespeople for that policy area. The groups need the money and legislative authority that only government can provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rhodes | first1 = R. A. W. | last2 = Marsh | first2 = David | author-link2 = David Marsh (political scientist) | title = Policy networks in British government | publisher = Clarendon Press Oxford University Press | location = Oxford Oxford New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780198278528 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governance===
The term refers to: a new process of governing; or a changed condition of ordered rule; or the new method by which society is governed. Rhodes applied the idea to public administration and public policy to refer the changing boundaries between public, private and voluntary sectors. For many policy arenas, these sectors are interdependent, so decisions are a product of their game-like interactions, rooted in trust and regulated by rules of the game negotiated and agreed by the participants. Such networks have significant degree of autonomy from the state - they are self-organising - although the state can indirectly and imperfectly steer them. In sum, governance refers to governing with and through networks; to network steering. The arguments that there had been a shift from ‘government to governance’, that it was the mix of bureaucracy, markets and networks that mattered, and a consequent ‘hollowing out of the state’ are now referred to, and debated, as ‘the Anglo-governance school’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Marinetto | first = Mike | title = Governing beyond the centre: a critique of the Anglo-Governance school | journal = Political Studies | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 592–608 | publisher = Wiley | doi = 10.1111/1467-9248.00443 | date = October 2003 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9248.00443 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhodes wrote the foundational texts of this school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rhodes | first = R. A. W. | title = Understanding governance: policy networks, governance, reflexivity, and accountability | publisher = Open University Press | location = Buckingham Philadelphia | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780335197279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Rhodes | first = R. A. W. | title = Understanding governance: ten years on | journal = Organization Studies | volume = 28 | issue = 8 | pages = 1243-1264 | publisher = Sage | doi = 10.1177/0170840607076586 | date = August 2007 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0170840607076586 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretive political science===
[[Mark Bevir]] and R. A. W. Rhodes are the authors of ''Interpreting British Governance'' (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rhodes | first1 = R. A. W. | last2 = Bevir | first2 = Mark | author-link2 = Mark Bevir | title = Interpreting British governance | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780415304528 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Governance Stories'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rhodes | first1 = R. A. W. | last2 = Bevir | first2 = Mark | author-link2 = Mark Bevir | title = Governance Stories | publisher = Routledge | location = New York/London | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780415459778 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that political science must necessarily be an interpretive art.  This is because they hold that the starting point of enquiry must be to unpack the meanings, beliefs, and preferences of actors in order to then make sense of understanding actions, practices, and institutions.  Political science is therefore an interpretative discipline underpinned by hermeneutic philosophy rather than positivism: there is no ‘science’ of politics, instead all explanations, including those that deploy statistics and models, are best conceived as narratives.  Bevir and Rhodes thus provide an elaborate philosophical foundation for a decentred theory of governance woven together by the notions of beliefs, traditions and dilemmas. 'It follows that the role of political scientists is to use (1) ethnography to uncover people’s beliefs and preferences, and (2) history to uncover traditions as they develop in response to dilemmas.  The product is a story of other people’s constructions of what they are doing, which provides actors’ views on changes in government, the economy, and society.  So, for example, a political scientist may select a part of the governance process, and then explain it by unpicking various political traditions and how actors within these traditions encounter and act to resolve dilemmas.  Governance is thus understood as the contingent and unintended outcome of competing narratives of governance.’&lt;ref name=Bevir&gt;{{cite book | last = Bevir | first = Mark | author-link = Mark Bevir | title = Encyclopedia of governance | pages = 194-195 | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2007 | isbn = 9781412905794 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A decentred theory of governance===
For Bevir and Rhodes, decentered theory revolves around the idea of situated agency: institutions, practices or socialisation cannot determine how people behave, so any course of action is a contingent individual choice. People’s actions are explained by their beliefs (or meanings or desires); any one belief is interpreted in the context of the wider web of a person’s beliefs; and these beliefs are explained by traditions and modified by dilemmas. A tradition (or episteme or paradigm) is the set of theories against the background of which a person comes to hold beliefs and perform actions. It is a first influence upon people – a set of beliefs that they inherit and then transform in response to encounters with "dilemmas" (or problems or anomalies).  A dilemma arises whenever novel circumstances generate a new belief that forces people to question their previously held beliefs.  Change occurs through encountering such dilemmas: while individual responses to dilemmas are grounded in traditions, they then modify just those traditions.'&lt;ref name=Bevir /&gt;

===Administrative ethnography===
Latterly, Rhodes argued that too few political scientists were engaged in observation and founded the [[Manchester University Press]] series on ‘Political and Administrative Ethnography’ to encourage fieldwork in political science. In his own work, he used [[ethnography]] as a tool for exploring the beliefs and practices of government actors (see Rhodes, 2007, 2011, and 2014 in Select Bibliography).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40446">{{redirect-distinguish|Difference equation|differential equation}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''recurrence relation''' is an [[equation]] that [[recursion|recursively]] defines a [[sequence]] or multidimensional array of values, once one or more initial terms are given: each further term of the sequence or array is defined as a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of the preceding terms.

The term '''[[#Relationship_to_difference_equations_narrowly_defined|difference equation]]''' sometimes (and for the purposes of this article) refers to a specific type of recurrence relation.  However, "difference equation" is frequently used to refer to ''any'' recurrence relation.

==Examples==

===Logistic map===
An example of a recurrence relation is the [[logistic map]]:

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = r x_n (1 - x_n),&lt;/math&gt;

with a given constant ''r''; given the initial term ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; each subsequent term is determined by this relation.

Some simply defined recurrence relations can have very complex ([[chaos theory|chaotic]]) behaviours, and they are a part of the field of mathematics known as [[Nonlinearity|nonlinear analysis]].

Solving a recurrence relation means obtaining a [[closed-form solution]]: a non-recursive function of ''n''.

===Fibonacci numbers===
The recurrence satisfied by the [[Fibonacci number]]s is the archetype of a homogeneous [[linear recurrence]] relation with constant coefficients (see below).  The Fibonacci sequence is defined using the recurrence

:&lt;math&gt;F_n = F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;

with [[initial condition]]s (seed values)

:&lt;math&gt;F_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_1 = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Explicitly, the recurrence yields the equations
:&lt;math&gt;F_2 = F_1 + F_0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_3 = F_2 + F_1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_4 = F_3 + F_2&lt;/math&gt;
etc.

We obtain the sequence of Fibonacci numbers, which begins
:0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

The recurrence can be solved by methods described below yielding [[Binet's formula]], which involves powers of the two roots of the characteristic polynomial ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''t''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1; the [[generating function]] of the sequence is the [[rational function]]
:  &lt;math&gt;\frac{t}{1-t-t^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Binomial coefficients===
A simple example of a multidimensional recurrence relation is given by the [[binomial coefficient]]s &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n}{k}&lt;/math&gt;, which count the number of ways of selecting ''k'' elements out of a set of ''n'' elements.
They can be computed by the recurrence relation
:&lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{k}=\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\binom{n-1}{k},&lt;/math&gt;
with the base cases &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n}{0}=\tbinom{n}{n}=1&lt;/math&gt;. Using this formula to compute the values of all binomial coefficients generates an infinite array called [[Pascal's triangle]]. The same values can also be computed directly by a different formula that is not a recurrence, but that requires multiplication and not just addition to compute:
&lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Relationship to difference equations narrowly defined ==
Given an ordered [[sequence]] &lt;math&gt;\left\{a_n\right\}_{n=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt; of [[real numbers]]: the '''first difference''' &lt;math&gt;\Delta(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(a_n) = a_{n+1} - a_n.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''second difference''' &lt;math&gt;\Delta^2(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^2(a_n) = \Delta(a_{n+1}) - \Delta(a_n),&lt;/math&gt;

which can be simplified to

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^2(a_n) = a_{n+2} - 2a_{n+1} + a_n.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally: the ''' ''k''-th difference''' of the sequence ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' written as &lt;math&gt;\Delta^k(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is defined recursively as

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^k(a_n) = \Delta^{k-1}(a_{n+1}) - \Delta^{k-1}(a_n)=\sum_{t=0}^k \binom{k}{t} (-1)^t a_{n+k-t}.&lt;/math&gt;

(The sequence and its differences are related by a [[binomial transform]].) The more restrictive definition of '''difference equation''' is an equation composed of ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and its ''k''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; differences. (A widely used broader definition treats "difference equation" as synonymous with "recurrence relation".  See for example [[rational difference equation]] and [[matrix difference equation]].)

Actually, it is easily seen that,

:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+k} = 
{k\choose 0}a_n + {k\choose 1} \Delta(a_n)  + \cdots + {k\choose k} \Delta^k(a_n).
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, a difference equation can be defined as an equation that involves 
''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;n-2&lt;/sub&gt;'' etc. (or equivalently
''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;n+2&lt;/sub&gt;'' etc.)

Since difference equations are a very common form of recurrence, some authors use the two terms interchangeably. For example, the difference equation

:&lt;math&gt;3\Delta^2(a_n) + 2\Delta(a_n) + 7a_n = 0&lt;/math&gt;

is equivalent to the recurrence relation

:&lt;math&gt;3a_{n+2} = 4a_{n+1} - 8a_n.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus one can solve many recurrence relations by rephrasing them as difference equations, and then solving the difference equation, analogously to how one solves [[ordinary differential equations]].  However, the [[Ackermann number]]s are an example of a recurrence relation that do not map to a difference equation, much less points on the solution to a differential equation.

See [[time scale calculus]] for a unification of the theory of difference equations with that of [[differential equations]].

[[Summation equation]]s relate to difference equations as [[integral equation]]s relate to differential equations.

===From sequences to grids===
Single-variable or one-dimensional recurrence relations are about sequences (i.e. functions defined on one-dimensional grids). Multi-variable or n-dimensional recurrence relations are about n-dimensional grids. Functions defined on n-grids can also be studied with '''partial difference equations'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1klnDGelHGEC Partial difference equations], Sui Sun Cheng, CRC Press, 2003, {{isbn|978-0-415-29884-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Constant-recursive sequence|Linear difference equation}}

====Roots of the characteristic polynomial====
An order-''d'' '''homogeneous linear recurrence with constant coefficients'''  is an equation of the form

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = c_1a_{n-1} + c_2a_{n-2}+\cdots+c_da_{n-d},&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''d'' coefficients ''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (for all ''i'') are constants, and &lt;math&gt;c_d\ne0&lt;/math&gt;.

A [[constant-recursive sequence]] is a sequence satisfying a recurrence of this form.  There are ''d'' [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] for solutions to this recurrence, i.e., the initial values &lt;math&gt;a_0,\dots,a_{d-1}&lt;/math&gt; can be taken to be any values but then the recurrence determines the sequence uniquely.

The same coefficients yield the [[characteristic polynomial]] (also "auxiliary polynomial")

:&lt;math&gt;p(t)= t^d - c_1t^{d-1} - c_2t^{d-2}-\cdots-c_{d}&lt;/math&gt;
whose ''d'' roots play a crucial role in finding and understanding the sequences satisfying the recurrence. If the roots ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... are all distinct, then each solution to the recurrence takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;a_n = k_1 r_1^n + k_2 r_2^n + \cdots + k_d r_d^n,&lt;/math&gt;
where the coefficients ''k&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are determined in order to fit the initial conditions of the recurrence. When the same roots occur multiple times, the terms in this formula corresponding to the second and later occurrences of the same root are multiplied by increasing powers of ''n''. For instance, if the characteristic polynomial can be factored as (''x''−''r'')&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, with the same root ''r'' occurring three times, then the solution would take the form
:&lt;math&gt;a_n = k_1 r^n + k_2 n r^n + k_3 n^2 r^n.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=2.1.1 Constant coefficients – A) Homogeneous equations|title=Mathematics for the Analysis of Algorithms|first1=Daniel H.|last1=Greene|first2=Donald E.|last2=Knuth|author2-link=Donald Knuth| edition=2nd| publisher=Birkhäuser |page=17 | year=1982}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the [[Fibonacci number]]s, other constant-recursive sequences include the [[Lucas number]]s and [[Lucas sequence]]s, the [[Jacobsthal number]]s, the [[Pell number]]s and more generally the solutions to [[Pell's equation]].

For order 1, the recurrence
:&lt;math&gt;a_{n}=r a_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
has the solution ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and the most general solution is ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''kr&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k''. The  characteristic polynomial equated to zero (the [[Characteristic polynomial|characteristic equation]]) is simply ''t''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

Solutions to such recurrence relations of higher order are found by systematic means, often using the fact that ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' is a solution for the recurrence exactly when ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r'' is a root of the characteristic polynomial. This can be approached directly or using [[generating function]]s ([[formal power series]]) or matrices.

Consider, for example, a recurrence relation of the form

:&lt;math&gt;a_{n}=Aa_{n-1}+Ba_{n-2}.&lt;/math&gt;

When does it have a solution of the same general form as ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''? Substituting this guess ([[ansatz]]) in the recurrence relation, we find that

:&lt;math&gt;r^{n}=Ar^{n-1}+Br^{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;

must be true for '''all'''&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.

Dividing through by ''r''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−2&lt;/sup&gt;, we get that all these equations reduce to the same thing:

:&lt;math&gt;r^2=Ar+B,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r^2-Ar-B=0,&lt;/math&gt;

which is the characteristic equation of the recurrence relation.  Solve for ''r'' to obtain the two roots ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: these roots are known as the [[characteristic root]]s or '''eigenvalues''' of the characteristic equation.  Different solutions are obtained depending on the nature of the roots:  If these roots are distinct, we have the general solution

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = C\lambda_1^n+D\lambda_2^n&lt;/math&gt;

while if they are identical (when ''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4''B''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0), we have

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = C\lambda^n+Dn\lambda^n&lt;/math&gt;

This is the most general solution; the two constants ''C'' and ''D'' can be chosen based on two given initial conditions ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to produce a specific solution.

In the case of complex eigenvalues (which also gives rise to complex values for the solution parameters ''C'' and ''D''), the use of complex numbers can be eliminated by rewriting the solution in trigonometric form.  In this case we can write the eigenvalues as &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1, \lambda_2 = \alpha \pm \beta i.&lt;/math&gt; Then it can be shown that

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = C\lambda_1^n+D\lambda_2^n&lt;/math&gt;

can be rewritten as&lt;ref&gt;Chiang, Alpha C., ''Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics'', third edition, McGraw-Hill, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|576–585}}

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = 2 M^n \left( E \cos(\theta n) + F \sin(\theta n)\right) = 2 G M^n \cos(\theta n - \delta),&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl}
  M = \sqrt{\alpha^2+\beta^2} &amp; \cos (\theta) =\tfrac{\alpha}{M} &amp; \sin( \theta) = \tfrac{\beta}{M} \\
  C,D = E \mp F i &amp; &amp; \\
  G = \sqrt{E^2+F^2} &amp; \cos (\delta ) = \tfrac{E}{G} &amp; \sin (\delta )= \tfrac{F}{G}
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''E'' and ''F'' (or equivalently, ''G'' and δ)  are real constants which depend on the initial conditions. Using 
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1+\lambda_2=2 \alpha = A,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 \cdot \lambda_2=\alpha^2+\beta^2=-B,&lt;/math&gt;

one may simplify the solution given above as

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = (-B)^{\frac{n}{2}} \left( E \cos(\theta n) + F \sin(\theta n)\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the initial conditions and

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  E &amp;=\frac{-A a_1 + a_2}{B} \\
 F &amp;=-i \frac{A^2 a_1 - A a_2 +2 a_1 B}{B \sqrt{A^2+4B}} \\
\theta &amp;=\arccos \left (\frac{A}{2 \sqrt{-B}} \right )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In this way there is no need to solve for λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and λ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

In all cases—real distinct eigenvalues, real duplicated eigenvalues, and complex conjugate eigenvalues—the equation is [[stability theory|stable]] (that is, the variable ''a'' converges to a fixed value [specifically, zero]) if and only if ''both'' eigenvalues are smaller than one in [[absolute value]].  In this second-order case, this condition on the eigenvalues can be shown&lt;ref&gt;Papanicolaou, Vassilis, "On the asymptotic stability of a class of linear difference equations," ''Mathematics Magazine'' 69(1), February 1996, 34&amp;ndash;43.&lt;/ref&gt; to be equivalent to |''A''|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''B''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2, which is equivalent to |''B''|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 and |''A''|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''B''.

The equation in the above example was [[homogeneous differential equation|homogeneous]], in that there was no constant term.  If one starts with the non-homogeneous recurrence

:&lt;math&gt;b_{n}=Ab_{n-1}+Bb_{n-2}+K&lt;/math&gt;

with constant term ''K'', this can be converted into homogeneous form as follows:  The [[steady state]] is found by setting ''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' =&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−2&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;''b''* to obtain

:&lt;math&gt; b^{*} = \frac{K}{1-A-B}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the non-homogeneous recurrence can be rewritten in homogeneous form as

:&lt;math&gt;[b_n - b^*]=A[b_{n-1}-b^*]+B[b_{n-2}-b^*],&lt;/math&gt;

which can be solved as above.

The stability condition stated above in terms of eigenvalues for the second-order case remains valid for the general ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-order case:  the equation is stable if and only if all eigenvalues of the characteristic equation are less than one in absolute value.

Given a homogeneous linear recurrence relation with constant coefficients of order ''d'', let ''p''(''t'') be the [[characteristic polynomial]] (also "auxiliary polynomial")

:&lt;math&gt;t^d - c_1t^{d-1} - c_2t^{d-2}-\cdots-c_{d} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

such that each ''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' corresponds to each ''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the original recurrence relation (see the general form above). Suppose &amp;lambda; is a root of ''p''(''t'') having [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] ''r''. This is to say that (''t''−λ)&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; divides ''p''(''t''). The following two properties hold:

# Each of the ''r'' sequences &lt;math&gt;\lambda^n, n\lambda^n, n^2\lambda^n,\dots,n^{r-1}\lambda^n&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the recurrence relation.
# Any sequence satisfying the recurrence relation can be written uniquely as a linear combination of solutions constructed in part 1 as ''λ'' varies over all distinct roots of&amp;nbsp;''p''(''t'').

As a result of this theorem a homogeneous linear recurrence relation with constant coefficients can be solved in the following manner:

# Find the characteristic polynomial ''p''(''t'').
# Find the roots of ''p''(''t'') counting multiplicity.
# Write ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' as a linear combination of all the roots (counting multiplicity as shown in the theorem above) with unknown coefficients ''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.

::&lt;math&gt;a_n = \left (b_1\lambda_1^n + b_2n\lambda_1^n + b_3n^2\lambda_1^n+\cdots+b_r n^{r-1}\lambda_1^n \right )+\cdots+ \left (b_{d-q+1}\lambda_{*}^n + \cdots + b_{d}n^{q-1}\lambda_{*}^n \right )&lt;/math&gt;

:This is the general solution to the original recurrence relation. (''q'' is the multiplicity of λ&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;)

:4. Equate each &lt;math&gt;a_0, a_1, \dots,a_d&lt;/math&gt; from part 3 (plugging in ''n'' = 0, ..., ''d'' into the general solution of the recurrence relation) with the known values &lt;math&gt;a_0, a_1, \dots,a_d&lt;/math&gt; from the original recurrence relation. However, the values ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' from the original recurrence relation used do not usually have to be contiguous: excluding exceptional cases, just ''d'' of them are needed (i.e., for an original homogeneous linear recurrence relation of order 3 one could use the values ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).  This process will produce a linear system of ''d'' equations with ''d'' unknowns. Solving these equations for the unknown coefficients &lt;math&gt;b_1, b_2, \dots,b_d &lt;/math&gt; of the general solution and plugging these values back into the general solution will produce the particular solution to the original recurrence relation that fits the original recurrence relation's initial conditions (as well as all subsequent values &lt;math&gt;a_0,a_1,a_2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; of the original recurrence relation).

The method for solving linear [[differential equations]] is similar to the method above—the "intelligent guess" ([[ansatz]]) for linear differential equations with constant coefficients is ''e''&lt;sup&gt;λ''x''&lt;/sup&gt; where λ is a complex number that is determined by substituting the guess into the differential equation.

This is not a coincidence.  Considering the [[Taylor series]] of the solution to a linear differential equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infin \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} (x-a)^n&lt;/math&gt;

it can be seen that the coefficients of the series are given by the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; derivative of ''f''(''x'') evaluated at the point ''a''. The differential equation provides a linear difference equation relating these coefficients.

This equivalence can be used to quickly solve for the recurrence relationship for the coefficients in the power series solution of a linear differential equation.

The rule of thumb (for equations in which the polynomial multiplying the first term is non-zero at zero) is that:

:&lt;math&gt;y^{[k]} \to  f[n+k]&lt;/math&gt;
and more generally
:&lt;math&gt;x^m*y^{[k]} \to n(n-1)...(n-m+1)f[n+k-m]&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example:''' The recurrence relationship for the Taylor series coefficients of the equation:

:&lt;math&gt; (x^2 + 3x -4)y^{[3]} -(3x+1)y^{[2]} + 2y = 0&lt;/math&gt;

is given by

:&lt;math&gt; n(n-1)f[n+1] + 3nf[n+2] -4f[n+3] -3nf[n+1] -f[n+2]+ 2f[n] = 0&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;-4f[n+3] +2nf[n+2] + n(n-4)f[n+1] +2f[n] = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This example shows how problems generally solved using the power series solution method taught in normal differential equation classes can be solved in a much easier way.

'''Example:''' The differential equation

:&lt;math&gt;ay'' + by' +cy = 0&lt;/math&gt;

has solution

:&lt;math&gt; y=e^{ax}.&lt;/math&gt;

The conversion of the differential equation to a difference equation of the Taylor coefficients is

:&lt;math&gt;af[n + 2] + bf[n + 1] + cf[n] = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

It is easy to see that the ''n''th derivative of ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''ax''&lt;/sup&gt; evaluated at 0 is ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;

====Solving via linear algebra====
A linearly recursive sequence y of order n

:&lt;math&gt;y_{n+k} - c_{n-1}y_{n-1+k} - c_{n-2}y_{n-2+k} + \cdots - c_{0}y_{k} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

is identical to

:&lt;math&gt;y_{n} = c_{n-1}y_{n-1} + c_{n-2}y_{n-2} + \cdots +c_{0}y_{0}.&lt;/math&gt;

Expanded with n-1 identities of kind &lt;math&gt;y_{n-k} = y_{n-k},&lt;/math&gt; this n-th order equation is translated into a [[matrix difference equation]] system of n first-order linear equations,

:&lt;math&gt;\vec y_{n} = \begin{bmatrix}y_n\\y_{n-1}\\ \vdots \\ \vdots \\ y_1 \end{bmatrix} =

\begin{bmatrix}
 c_{n-1} &amp; c_{n-2} &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; c_{0} \\
 1       &amp; 0       &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; 0     \\
 0       &amp; \ddots  &amp; \ddots &amp;        &amp;\vdots \\
 \vdots  &amp; \ddots  &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp;\vdots \\
 0       &amp; \cdots  &amp; 0      &amp; 1     &amp; 0      \end{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix}y_{n-1} \\y_{n-2} \\ \vdots \\ \vdots \\ y_0 \end{bmatrix} 
= C\ \vec y_{n-1} = C^n \vec y_0.&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that the vector &lt;math&gt;\vec y_n&lt;/math&gt; can be computed by ''n'' applications of the [[companion matrix]], C, to the initial state vector, &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt;. Thereby, n-th entry of the sought sequence y, is the top component of &lt;math&gt;\vec y_n, y_n = \vec y_n[n]&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Eigendecomposition of a matrix#Example|Eigendecomposition]], &lt;math&gt;\vec y_n = C^n\, \vec y_0 = c_1\,\lambda_1^n\,\vec e_1 + c_2\,\lambda_2^n\,\vec e_2 + \cdots + c_n\,\lambda_n^n\,\vec e_n&lt;/math&gt; into eigenvalues, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_n&lt;/math&gt;, and eigenvectors, &lt;math&gt;\vec e_1, \vec e_2, \ldots, \vec e_n&lt;/math&gt;, is used to compute &lt;math&gt;\vec y_n.&lt;/math&gt; Thanks to the crucial fact that system ''C'' time-shifts every eigenvector, ''e'', by simply scaling its components ''λ'' times,

:&lt;math&gt;C\,\vec e_i = \lambda_i \vec e_i = C \begin{bmatrix}e_{i,n} \\e_{i,n-1} \\ \vdots \\ e_{i,1}\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\lambda_i\,e_{i,n} \\ \lambda_i\,e_{i,n-1} \\ \vdots \\ \lambda_i\,e_{i,1}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

that is, time-shifted version of eigenvector,''e'', has components ''λ'' times larger, the eigenvector components are powers of ''λ'', &lt;math&gt;\vec e_i = \begin{bmatrix}\lambda_i^{n-1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \lambda_i^2 &amp; \lambda_i &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}^T,&lt;/math&gt; and, thus, recurrent homogeneous linear equation solution is a combination of exponential functions, &lt;math&gt;\vec y_n = \sum_1^n {c_i\,\lambda_i^n\,\vec e_i}&lt;/math&gt;. The components &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; can be determined out of initial conditions:

:&lt;math&gt;\vec y_0 = \begin{bmatrix}y_{0}\\ y_{-1} \\ \vdots\\ y_{-n+1}\end{bmatrix} = \sum_{i=1}^n {c_i\,\lambda_i^0\,\vec e_i} = \begin{bmatrix}\vec e_1 &amp; \vec e_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; \vec e_n\end{bmatrix}\,\begin{bmatrix}c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \cdots \\ c_n\end{bmatrix} = E\, \begin{bmatrix}c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \cdots \\ c_n\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for coefficients,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \cdots \\ c_n\end{bmatrix} = E^{-1} \vec y_0 = \begin{bmatrix}\lambda_1^{n-1} &amp; \lambda_2^{n-1} &amp; \cdots &amp;  \lambda_n^{n-1} \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ \lambda_1 &amp; \lambda_2 &amp; \cdots &amp;  \lambda_n \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}^{-1}\,\begin{bmatrix}y_{0}\\ y_{-1} \\ \vdots\\ y_{-n+1}\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

This also works with arbitrary boundary conditions &lt;math&gt;\underbrace{y_a, y_b, \ldots}_\text{n}&lt;/math&gt;, not necessary the initial ones,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}y_a \\ y_b \\ \vdots\end{bmatrix}  = \begin{bmatrix}\vec y_a[n] \\ \vec y_b[n] \\ \vdots\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\sum_{i=1}^n {c_i\,\lambda_i^a\,\vec e_i[n]} \\ \sum_{i=1}^n {c_i\,\lambda_i^b\,\vec e_i[n]} \\ \vdots\end{bmatrix}  =\begin{bmatrix}\sum_{i=1}^n {c_i\,\lambda_i^a\,\lambda_i^{n-1}} \\ \sum_{i=1}^n {c_i\,\lambda_i^b\,\lambda_i^{n-1}} \\ \vdots\end{bmatrix} = &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = \begin{bmatrix}\sum {c_i\,\lambda_i^{a+n-1}} \\ \sum {c_i\,\lambda_i^{b+n-1}} \\ \vdots\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\lambda_1^{a+n-1} &amp; \lambda_2^{a+n-1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \lambda_n^{a+n-1} \\ \lambda_1^{b+n-1} &amp; \lambda_2^{b+n-1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \lambda_n^{b+n-1} \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \end{bmatrix}\,\begin{bmatrix}c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \vdots \\ c_n\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

This description is really no different from general method above, however it is more succinct. It also works nicely for situations like
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
  a_n =a_{n-1}-b_{n-1}\\
  b_n =2a_{n-1}+b_{n-1}.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
where there are several linked recurrences.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Discrete Algorithmic Mathematics|first1=Stephen B.|last1=Maurer|first2=Anthony|last2=Ralston|edition=2nd|publisher=A K Peters|year=1998|isbn=9781568810911|page=609}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Solving with z-transforms====
Certain difference equations - in particular, [[Z-transform#Linear constant-coefficient difference equation|linear constant coefficient]] difference equations - can be solved using [[z-transform]]s. The ''z''-transforms are a class of [[integral transform]]s that lead to more convenient algebraic manipulations and more straightforward solutions. There are cases in which obtaining a direct solution would be all but impossible, yet solving the problem via a thoughtfully chosen integral transform is straightforward.

===Solving non-homogeneous linear recurrence relations with constant coefficients===
If the recurrence is non-homogeneous, a particular solution can be found by the [[method of undetermined coefficients]] and the solution is the sum of the solution of the homogeneous and the particular solutions.  Another method to solve a non-homogeneous recurrence is the method of ''symbolic differentiation''.  For example, consider the following recurrence:

:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+1} = a_{n} + 1&lt;/math&gt;

This is a non-homogeneous recurrence.  If we substitute ''n'' ↦ ''n''+1, we obtain the recurrence

:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + 1&lt;/math&gt;

Subtracting the original recurrence from this equation yields

:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+2} - a_{n+1} = a_{n+1} - a_{n}&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently

:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+2} = 2 a_{n+1} - a_n&lt;/math&gt;

This is a homogeneous recurrence, which can be solved by the methods explained above.  In general, if a linear recurrence has the form

:&lt;math&gt; a_{n+k} = \lambda_{k-1} a_{n+k-1} + \lambda_{k-2} a_{n+k-2} + \cdots + \lambda_1 a_{n+1} + \lambda_0 a_{n} + p(n) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0, \lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; are constant coefficients and ''p''(''n'') is the inhomogeneity, then if ''p''(''n'') is a polynomial with degree ''r'', then this non-homogeneous recurrence can be reduced to a homogeneous recurrence by applying the method of symbolic differencing ''r'' times.

If
:&lt;math&gt;P(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty p_n x^n&lt;/math&gt;
is the generating function of the inhomogeneity, the generating function
:&lt;math&gt;A(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a(n) x^n&lt;/math&gt;
of the non-homogeneous recurrence 
:&lt;math&gt; a_n = \sum_{i=1}^s c_i a_{n-i}+p_n,\quad n\ge n_r,&lt;/math&gt;
with constant coefficients {{math|c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is derived from
:&lt;math&gt; \left (1-\sum_{i=1}^sc_ix^i \right )A(x)=P(x)+\sum_{n=0}^{n_r-1}[a_n-p_n]x^n-\sum_{i=1}^s c_ix^i\sum_{n=0}^{n_r-i-1}a_nx^n.&lt;/math&gt;
If ''P''(''x'') is a rational generating function, ''A''(''x'') is also one. The case discussed above, where ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''K'' is a constant, emerges as one example of this formula, with ''P''(''x'') = ''K''/(1−''x''). Another example, the recurrence &lt;math&gt;a_n=10 a_{n-1}+n&lt;/math&gt; with linear inhomogeneity, arises in the definition of the [[schizophrenic number]]s. The solution of homogeneous recurrences is incorporated as ''p'' = ''P'' = 0.

===Solving first-order non-homogeneous recurrence relations with variable coefficients===
Moreover, for the general first-order non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation with variable coefficients:

:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+1} = f_n a_n + g_n, \qquad f_n \neq 0,&lt;/math&gt;
there is also a nice method to solve it:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.pccu.edu.tw/%7Emeng/Math15.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705023731/http://faculty.pccu.edu.tw/~meng/Math15.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_{n+1} - f_n a_n = g_n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a_{n+1}}{\prod_{k=0}^n f_k} - \frac{f_n a_n}{\prod_{k=0}^n f_k} = \frac{g_n}{\prod_{k=0}^n f_k}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a_{n+1}}{\prod_{k=0}^n f_k} - \frac{a_n}{\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} f_k} = \frac{g_n}{\prod_{k=0}^n f_k}&lt;/math&gt;

Let 
:&lt;math&gt;A_n = \frac{a_n}{\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} f_k},&lt;/math&gt;
Then 
:&lt;math&gt;A_{n+1} - A_n = \frac{g_n}{\prod_{k=0}^n f_k}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^{n-1}(A_{m+1} - A_m) = A_n - A_0 = \sum_{m=0}^{n-1}\frac{g_m}{\prod_{k=0}^m f_k}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a_n}{\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} f_k} = A_0 + \sum_{m=0}^{n-1}\frac{g_m}{\prod_{k=0}^m f_k}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_n = \left(\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} f_k \right) \left(A_0 + \sum_{m=0}^{n-1}\frac{g_m}{\prod_{k=0}^m f_k}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

If we apply the formula to &lt;math&gt;a_{n+1} = (1 + h f_{nh}) a_n + hg_{nh}&lt;/math&gt; and take the limit h→0, we get the formula for first order [[linear differential equation]]s with variable coefficients; the sum becomes an integral, and the product becomes the exponential function of an integral.

===Solving general homogeneous linear recurrence relations===
Many homogeneous linear recurrence relations may be solved by means of the [[generalized hypergeometric series]]. Special cases of these lead to recurrence relations for the [[orthogonal polynomials]], and many [[special function]]s. For example, the solution to

:&lt;math&gt;J_{n+1}=\frac{2n}{z}J_n-J_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

is given by

:&lt;math&gt;J_n=J_n(z), &lt;/math&gt;

the [[Bessel function]], while

:&lt;math&gt;(b-n)M_{n-1} +(2n-b-z)M_n - nM_{n+1}=0 &lt;/math&gt;

is solved by

:&lt;math&gt;M_n=M(n,b;z) &lt;/math&gt;

the [[confluent hypergeometric series]]. Sequences which are the solutions of [[P-recursive equation|linear difference equations with polynomial coefficients]] are called [[Holonomic function|P-recursive]]. For these specific recurrence equations algorithms are known which find [[Polynomial solutions of P-recursive equations|polynomial]], [[Abramov's algorithm|rational]] or [[Petkovšek's algorithm|hypergeometric]] solutions. 

===Solving first-order rational difference equations===
{{Main|Rational difference equation}}

A first order rational difference equation has the form &lt;math&gt;w_{t+1} = \tfrac{aw_t+b}{cw_t+d}&lt;/math&gt;. Such an equation can be solved by writing &lt;math&gt;w_t&lt;/math&gt; as a nonlinear transformation of another variable &lt;math&gt;x_t&lt;/math&gt; which itself evolves linearly.  Then standard methods can be used to solve the linear difference equation in &lt;math&gt;x_t&lt;/math&gt;.

==Stability==

===Stability of linear higher-order recurrences===
The linear recurrence of order ''d'',

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = c_1a_{n-1} + c_2a_{n-2}+\cdots+c_da_{n-d},  &lt;/math&gt;

has the [[Characteristic polynomial|characteristic equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda^d - c_1 \lambda^{d-1} - c_2 \lambda^{d-2} - \cdots - c_d \lambda^0 =0. &lt;/math&gt;

The recurrence is [[Stability theory|stable]], meaning that the iterates converge asymptotically to a fixed value, if and only if the [[eigenvalues]] (i.e., the roots of the characteristic equation), whether real or complex, are all less than [[unity (mathematics)|unity]] in absolute value.

===Stability of linear first-order matrix recurrences===
{{Main|Matrix difference equation}}

In the first-order matrix difference equation

:&lt;math&gt;[x_t - x^*] = A[x_{t-1}-x^*]&lt;/math&gt;

with state vector ''x'' and transition matrix ''A'', ''x'' converges asymptotically to the steady state vector ''x''* if and only if all eigenvalues of the transition matrix ''A'' (whether real or complex) have an [[absolute value]] which is less than&amp;nbsp;1.

===Stability of nonlinear first-order recurrences===
Consider the nonlinear first-order recurrence

:&lt;math&gt;x_n=f(x_{n-1}).&lt;/math&gt;

This recurrence is [[stability theory|locally stable]], meaning that it [[limit of a sequence|converges]] to a fixed point ''x''* from points sufficiently close to ''x''*, if the slope of ''f''  in the neighborhood of ''x''* is smaller than [[unity (mathematics)|unity]] in absolute value:  that is,

: &lt;math&gt;| f' (x^*) | &lt; 1. &lt;/math&gt;

A nonlinear recurrence could have multiple fixed points, in which case some fixed points may be locally stable and others locally unstable; for continuous ''f''  two adjacent fixed points cannot both be locally stable.

A nonlinear recurrence relation could also have a cycle of period ''k'' for ''k'' &gt; 1.  Such a cycle is stable, meaning that it attracts a set of initial conditions of positive measure, if the composite function

:&lt;math&gt;g(x) := f \circ f \circ \cdots \circ f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

with ''f'' appearing ''k'' times is locally stable according to the same criterion:

: &lt;math&gt;| g' (x^*) | &lt; 1,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x''* is any point on the cycle.

In a [[chaos theory|chaotic]] recurrence relation, the variable ''x'' stays in a bounded region but never converges to a fixed point or an attracting cycle; any fixed points or cycles of the equation are unstable.  See also [[logistic map]], [[dyadic transformation]], and [[tent map]].

== Relationship to differential equations ==
When solving an [[ordinary differential equation]] [[numerical ordinary differential equations|numerically]], one typically encounters a recurrence relation. For example, when solving the [[initial value problem]]

:&lt;math&gt;y'(t) = f(t,y(t)), \ \ y(t_0)=y_0,&lt;/math&gt;

with [[Euler's method]] and a step size ''h'', one calculates the values

:&lt;math&gt;y_0=y(t_0), \ \ y_1=y(t_0+h), \ \ y_2=y(t_0+2h), \ \dots&lt;/math&gt;

by the recurrence

:&lt;math&gt;\, y_{n+1} = y_n + hf(t_n,y_n). &lt;/math&gt;

Systems of linear first order differential equations can be discretized exactly analytically using the methods shown in the [[discretization]] article.

== Applications ==

=== Biology ===
Some of the best-known difference equations have their origins in the attempt to model [[population]] dynamics. For example, the [[Fibonacci number]]s were once used as a model for the growth of a rabbit population.

The [[logistic map]] is used either directly to model population growth, or as a starting point for more detailed models of [[population dynamics]]. In this context, coupled difference equations are often used to model the interaction of two or more populations. For example, the Nicholson-Bailey model for a host-[[parasite]] interaction is given by

:&lt;math&gt;N_{t+1} = \lambda N_t e^{-aP_t} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_{t+1} = N_t(1-e^{-aP_t}), &lt;/math&gt;

with ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; representing the hosts, and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; the parasites, at time&amp;nbsp;''t''.

[[Integrodifference equation]]s are a form of recurrence relation important to spatial [[ecology]]. These and other difference equations are particularly suited to modeling [[voltinism|univoltine]] populations.

===Computer science===
Recurrence relations are also of fundamental importance in [[analysis of algorithms]].&lt;ref&gt;Cormen, T. et al, ''Introduction to Algorithms'', MIT Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Sedgewick, F. Flajolet, ''An Introduction to the Analysis of Algorithms'', Addison-Wesley, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; If an [[algorithm]] is designed so that it will break a problem into smaller subproblems ([[Divide and conquer algorithm|divide and conquer]]), its running time is described by a recurrence relation.

A simple example is the time an algorithm takes to find an element in an ordered vector with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements,  in the worst case.

A naive algorithm will search from left to right, one element at a time. The worst possible scenario is when the required element is the last, so the number of comparisons is &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

A better algorithm is called [[Binary search algorithm|binary search]]. However, it requires a sorted vector. It will first check if the element is at the middle of the vector. If not, then it will check if the middle element is greater or lesser than the sought element. At this point, half of the vector can be discarded, and the algorithm can be run again on the other half. The number of comparisons will be given by

:&lt;math&gt;c_1=1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c_n=1+c_{n/2}&lt;/math&gt;

the [[Time complexity|time complexity]] of which will be &lt;math&gt;O(\log_2(n))&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Digital signal processing ===
In [[digital signal processing]], recurrence relations can model feedback in a system, where outputs at one time become inputs for future time. They thus arise in [[infinite impulse response]] (IIR) [[digital filter]]s.

For example, the equation for a "feedforward" IIR [[comb filter]] of delay ''T'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;y_t = (1 - \alpha) x_t + \alpha y_{t - T}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;x_t&lt;/math&gt; is the input at time ''t'', &lt;math&gt;y_t&lt;/math&gt; is the output at time ''t'', and α controls how much of the delayed signal is fed back into the output.  From this we can see that

:&lt;math&gt;y_t = (1 - \alpha) x_t + \alpha ((1-\alpha) x_{t-T} + \alpha y_{t - 2T})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_t = (1 - \alpha) x_t + (\alpha-\alpha^2) x_{t-T}  + \alpha^2 y_{t - 2T})&lt;/math&gt;

etc.

===Economics===
Recurrence relations, especially linear recurrence relations, are used extensively in both theoretical and empirical economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Nancy L. |last=Stokey |authorlink=Nancy Stokey |first2=Robert E., Jr. |last2=Lucas |authorlink2=Robert Lucas, Jr. |first3=Edward C. |last3=Prescott |authorlink3=Edward C.

The model would then be solved for current values of key variables (interest rate, real GDP, etc.) in terms of [[exogeny|exogenous variables]] and lagged [[endogeneity (economics)|endogenous]] variables.  See also [[time series analysis]].

[[File:Klonglan waterfall 03.jpg|thumb|260px|right| This waterfall and fast flowing water in [[Khlong Lan National Park]] is also part of a river ecosystem]]

River [[ecosystem|ecosystems]] are flowing waters that drain the landscape, and include the [[Biotic component|biotic]] (living) interactions amongst plants, animals and micro-organisms, as well as [[abiotic]] (nonliving) physical and chemical interactions of its many parts.&lt;ref name=Ang&gt;Angelier, E.  2003.  Ecology of Streams and Rivers.  Science Publishers, Inc., Enfield. Pp. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BiologyConcepts&amp;Connections&gt;”Biology Concepts &amp; Connections Sixth Edition”, Campbell, Neil A. (2009), page 2, 3 and G-9. Retrieved 2010-06-14.&lt;/ref&gt; River ecosystems are part of larger [[Drainage basin|watershed]] networks or catchments, where smaller [[headwater]] streams drain into mid-size streams, which progressively drain into larger river networks. 

River ecosystems are prime examples of lotic ecosystems. ''Lotic'' refers to flowing water, from the [[Latin]] ''lotus'', meaning washed. Lotic waters range from [[Spring (water)|spring]]s only a few centimeters wide to major [[river]]s kilometers in width.&lt;ref name=Allan&gt;Allan, J.D.  1995.  Stream Ecology: structure and function of running waters. Chapman and Hall, London.  Pp. 388.
&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this article applies to lotic ecosystems in general, including related lotic systems such as [[stream]]s and [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]]. Lotic ecosystems can be contrasted with [[lentic ecosystems]], which involve relatively still terrestrial waters such as lakes, ponds, and [[Wetland|wetlands]]. Together, these two ecosystems form the more general study area of freshwater or [[aquatic ecology]].

The following unifying characteristics make the ecology of running waters unique among aquatic habitats.&lt;ref name=Gill&gt;Giller, S. and B. Malmqvist.  1998.  The Biology of Streams and Rivers. Oxford University Press, Oxford.  Pp. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;
::* Flow is unidirectional.
::* There is a state of continuous physical change.
::* There is a high degree of spatial and temporal heterogeneity at all scales ([[microhabitat]]s).
::* Variability between lotic systems is quite high.
::* The biota is specialized to live with flow conditions.

==Abiotic factors==
The non living components of an ecosystem are called abiotic components
[[File:Cooplacurripa R.JPG|thumb|right|A pensive Cooplacurripa River, [[NSW]]]]

===Water flow===
Unidirectional water flow is the key factor in lotic systems influencing their ecology. Stream flow can be continuous or intermittent, though . Stream flow is the result of the summative inputs from groundwater, precipitation, and overland flow. Water flow can vary between systems, ranging from torrential rapids to slow backwaters that almost seem like lentic systems. The speed or velocity of the water flow of the water column can also vary within a system and is subject to chaotic turbulence, though water velocity tends to be highest in the middle part of the stream channel (known as the [[Thalweg|thalveg]]). This turbulence results in divergences of flow from the mean downslope flow vector as typified by eddy currents.  The mean flow rate vector is based on variability of friction with the bottom or sides of the channel, [[sinuosity]], obstructions, and the incline gradient.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt;  In addition, the amount of water input into the system from direct precipitation, [[snowmelt]], and/or groundwater can affect flow rate. The amount of water in a stream is measured as [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] (volume per unit time). As water flows downstream, streams and rivers most often gain water volume, so at [[Baseflow|base flow]] (i.e., no storm input), smaller headwater streams have very low discharge, while larger rivers have much higher discharge. The "flow regime" of a river or stream includes the general patterns of discharge over annual or decadal time scales, and may capture seasonal changes in flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Canadian Science Publishing|url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/f89-228#.W_yLUS3MxHQ|doi=10.1139/f89-228#.w_ylus3mxhq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poff|first=N.

While water flow is strongly determined by slope, flowing waters can alter the general shape or direction of the stream bed, a characteristic also known as [[geomorphology]]. The profile of the river water column is made up of three primary actions: erosion, transport, and deposition. Rivers have been described as "the gutters down which run the ruins of continents".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://store.doverpublications.com/0486685888.html|title=Fluvial Processes in Geomorphology|website=store.doverpublications.com|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rivers are continuously [[Erosion|eroding]], transporting, and [[Deposition (geology)|depositing]] substrate, sediment, and organic material. The continuous movement of water and entrained material creates a variety of habitats, including [[riffle]]s, [[Bacterial gliding|glides]], and [[Stream pool|pools]].&lt;ref name="Cush"&gt;Cushing, C.E. and J.D.

'''Light''' is important to lotic systems, because it provides the energy necessary to drive [[primary production]] via [[photosynthesis]], and can also provide refuge for prey species in shadows it casts.  The amount of light that a system receives can be related to a combination of internal and external stream variables.  The area surrounding a small stream, for example, might be shaded by surrounding forests or by valley walls.  Larger river systems tend to be wide so the influence of external variables is minimized, and the sun reaches the surface.  These rivers also tend to be more turbulent, however, and particles in the water increasingly attenuate light as depth increases.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt;  Seasonal and diurnal factors might also play a role in light availability because the angle of incidence, the angle at which light strikes water can lead to light lost from reflection.  Known as [[Beers law|Beer's Law]], the shallower the angle, the more light is reflected and the amount of solar radiation received declines logarithmically with depth.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; Additional influences on light availability include cloud cover, altitude, and geographic position.&lt;ref name=Brown1987&gt;Brown 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temperature===
[[File:Castle Geyser, Yellowstone, 1874.jpg|thumb|right|[[Castle Geyser]], [[Yellowstone National Park]]]]

Most lotic species are [[poikilotherm]]s whose internal temperature varies with their environment, thus temperature is a key abiotic factor for them. Water can be heated or cooled through radiation at the surface and conduction to or from the air and surrounding substrate.  Shallow streams are typically well mixed and maintain a relatively uniform temperature within an area. In deeper, slower moving water systems, however, a strong difference between the bottom and surface temperatures may develop.  Spring fed systems have little variation as springs are typically from groundwater sources, which are often very close to ambient temperature.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;  Many systems show strong [[Diurnal temperature variation|diurnal]] fluctuations and seasonal variations are most extreme in arctic, desert and temperate systems.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;  The amount of shading, climate and elevation can also influence the temperature of lotic systems.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt;

===Chemistry===
[[File:Winter Forest Near Erzhausen II.jpg|thumb|right|A forest stream in the winter near [[Erzhausen]], [[Germany]]]]

Water chemistry in river ecosystems varies depending on which dissolved solutes and gases are present in the water column of the stream. Specifically river water can include, apart from the water itself, 
* dissolved inorganic matter and major ions (calcium, sodium, magnesium, potassium, bicarbonate, sulfide, chloride)
* dissolved inorganic nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, silica)
* suspended and dissolved organic matter
* gases (nitrogen, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, oxygen)
* trace metals and pollutants

==== Dissolved ions and nutrients ====
Dissolved stream solutes can be considered either ''reactive'' or ''conservative''. Reactive solutes are readily biologically assimilated by the [[Autotroph|autotrophic]] and [[heterotrophic]] biota of the stream; examples can include inorganic nitrogen species such as nitrate or ammonium, some forms of phosphorus (e.g., soluble reactive phosphorus), and silica. Other solutes can be considered conservative, which indicates that the solute is not taken up and used biologically; chloride is often considered a conservative solute. Conservative solutes are often used as hydrologic tracers for water movement and transport. Both reactive and conservative stream water chemistry is foremost determined by inputs from the geology of its [[drainage basin|watershed]], or catchment area. Stream water chemistry can also be influenced by precipitation,  and the addition of pollutants from human sources.&lt;ref name="Allan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cush" /&gt; Large differences in chemistry do not usually exist within small lotic systems due to a high rate of mixing.  In larger river systems, however, the concentrations of most nutrients, dissolved salts, and pH decrease as distance increases from the river’s source.&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt;

==== Dissolved gases ====
In terms of dissolved gases, [[oxygen]] is likely the most important chemical constituent of lotic systems, as all aerobic organisms require it for survival.  It enters the water mostly via diffusion at the water-air interface.  Oxygen’s solubility in water decreases as water pH and temperature increases. Fast, turbulent streams expose more of the water’s surface area to the air and tend to have low temperatures and thus more oxygen than slow, backwaters.&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt; Oxygen is a byproduct of photosynthesis, so systems with a high abundance of aquatic algae and plants may also have high concentrations of oxygen during the day.  These levels can decrease significantly during the night when primary producers switch to respiration.  Oxygen can be limiting if circulation between the surface and deeper layers is poor, if the activity of lotic animals is very high, or if there is a large amount of organic decay occurring.&lt;ref name="Cush" /&gt;

==== Suspended matter ====
Rivers can also transport suspended inorganic and organic matter. These materials can include sediment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dean|first=David J.|last2=Topping|first2=David J.|last3=Schmidt|first3=John C.|last4=Griffiths|first4=Ronald E.|last5=Sabol|first5=Thomas A.|date=January 2016|title=Sediment supply versus local hydraulic controls on sediment transport and storage in a river with large sediment loads|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015JF003436|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface|language=en|volume=121|issue=1|pages=82–110|doi=10.1002/2015jf003436|issn=2169-9003}}&lt;/ref&gt; or terrestrially-derived organic matter that falls into the stream channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Webster|first=J.

===Substrate===
[[File:Gabas 007.jpg|thumb|right|Cascade in the [[Pyrénées]]]]

The inorganic [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]] of lotic systems is composed of the [[geologic]] material present in the catchment that is eroded, transported, sorted, and deposited by the current.  Inorganic substrates are classified by size on the [[Wentworth scale]], which ranges from boulders, to pebbles, to gravel, to sand, and to silt.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; Typically, substrate [[Particle size (grain size)|particle size]] decreases downstream with larger boulders and stones in more mountainous areas and sandy bottoms in lowland rivers.  This is because the higher gradients of mountain streams facilitate a faster flow, moving smaller substrate materials further downstream for deposition.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt; Substrate can also be organic and may include fine particles, autumn shed leaves, [[large woody debris]] such as submerged tree logs, moss, and semi-aquatic plants.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt; Substrate deposition is not necessarily a permanent event, as it can be subject to large modifications during flooding events.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt;

==Biotic factors==
The living components of an ecosystem are called the biotic components. Streams have numerous types of biotic organisms that live in them, including bacteria, primary producers, insects and other invertebrates, as well as fish and other vertebrates.

=== Biofilm ===
[[Biofilm]] is the combination of algae, diatoms, fungi, bacteria, plankton, and other small [[microorganism]]s that exist in a film along the [[streambed]] or [[benthos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Battin|first=Tom J.|last2=Besemer|first2=Katharina|last3=Bengtsson|first3=Mia M.|last4=Romani|first4=Anna M.|last5=Packmann|first5=Aaron I.|date=April 2016|title=The ecology and biogeochemistry of stream biofilms|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro.2016.15|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|language=En|volume=14|issue=4|pages=251–263|doi=10.1038/nrmicro.2016.15|issn=1740-1526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biofilm assemblages themselves are complex,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Besemer|first=Katharina|last2=Peter|first2=Hannes|last3=Logue|first3=Jürg B|last4=Langenheder|first4=Silke|last5=Lindström|first5=Eva S|last6=Tranvik|first6=Lars J|last7=Battin|first7=Tom J|date=August 2012|title=Unraveling assembly of stream biofilm communities|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3400417/|journal=The ISME Journal|volume=6|issue=8|pages=1459–1468|doi=10.1038/ismej.2011.205|issn=1751-7362|pmc=3400417|pmid=22237539}}&lt;/ref&gt; and add to the complexity of a streambed. 

===Bacteria===
[[Bacteria]] are present in large numbers in lotic waters.  Free-living forms are associated with decomposing organic material, [[biofilm]] on the surfaces of rocks and vegetation, in between particles that compose the substrate, and suspended in the [[water column]].  Other forms are also associated with the guts of lotic organisms as parasites or in [[commensal]] relationships.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;  Bacteria play a large role in energy recycling (see [[#Trophic relationships|below]]).&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt;

===Primary producers===
[[File:Periphyton.jpg|thumb|right|Periphyton]]
[[File:water hyacinth.jpg|thumb|right|Common water hyacinth in flower]]

Algae, consisting of [[phytoplankton]] and [[periphyton]], are the most significant sources of primary production in most streams and rivers.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; Phytoplankton float freely in the water column and thus are unable to maintain populations in fast flowing streams.  They can, however, develop sizeable populations in slow moving rivers and backwaters.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt; Periphyton are typically filamentous and tufted algae that can attach themselves to objects to avoid being washed away by fast currents.  In places where flow rates are negligible or absent, periphyton may form a gelatinous, unanchored floating mat.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt;

Plants exhibit limited adaptations to fast flow and are most successful in reduced currents.  More primitive plants, such as [[moss]]es and [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s attach themselves to solid objects.  This typically occurs in colder headwaters where the mostly rocky substrate offers attachment sites.  Some plants are free floating at the water’s surface in dense mats like [[duckweed]] or [[water hyacinth]].  Others are rooted and may be classified as submerged or emergent.  Rooted plants usually occur in areas of slackened current where fine-grained soils are found.&lt;ref name=Brown1987/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt; These rooted plants are flexible, with elongated leaves that offer minimal resistance to current.&lt;ref name=Ang/&gt;

Living in flowing water can be beneficial to plants and algae because the current is usually well aerated and it provides a continuous supply of nutrients.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt; These organisms are limited by flow, light, water chemistry, substrate, and grazing pressure.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;  Algae and plants are important to lotic systems as sources of energy, for forming microhabitats that shelter other fauna from predators and the current, and as a food resource.&lt;ref name=Brown1987/&gt;
{{clear}}

===Insects and other invertebrates===
Up to 90% of [[invertebrate]]s in some lotic systems are [[insect]]s.  These species exhibit tremendous diversity and can be found occupying almost every available habitat, including the surfaces of stones, deep below the substratum in the [[hyporheic zone]], adrift in the current, and in the surface film. 

Insects have developed several strategies for living in the diverse flows of lotic systems.  Some avoid high current areas, inhabiting the substratum or the sheltered side of rocks. Others have flat bodies to reduce the drag forces they experience from living in running water.&lt;ref name="Poff_2006"&gt; {{cite journal

}} &lt;/ref&gt;. Some insects time their life events based on when floods and droughts occur. For example, some mayflies synchronize when they emerge as flying adults with when snowmelt flooding usually occurs in Colorado streams. Other insects do not have a flying stage and spend their entire life cycle in the river. 

Like most of the primary consumers, lotic invertebrates often rely heavily on the current to bring them food and oxygen.&lt;ref name="CumminsKlug"&gt; {{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Invertebrates are important as both consumers and prey items in lotic systems.

The common orders of insects that are found in river ecosystems include [[Ephemeroptera]] (also known as a [[mayfly]]), [[Trichoptera]] (also known as a [[caddisfly]]), [[Plecoptera]] (also known as a [[stonefly]], [[Diptera]] (also known as a true [[fly]]), some types of [[Coleoptera]] (also known as a [[beetle]]), [[Odonata]] (the group that includes the [[dragonfly]] and the [[damselfly]]), and some types of [[Hemiptera]] (also known as true bugs).

Additional invertebrate [[taxa]] common to flowing waters include [[mollusk]]s such as [[snail]]s, [[limpet]]s, [[clam]]s, [[mussel]]s, as well as [[crustacean]]s like [[crayfish]], [[amphipoda]] and [[crab]]s.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt;

===Fish and other vertebrates===
[[File:Salvelinus fontinalis.jpg|thumb|right|The [[brook trout]] is native to small streams, creeks, lakes, and spring ponds.]]
[[File:New Zealand long fin eel.jpg|thumb|right|[[New Zealand longfin eel]]s can weigh over 50 kilograms.]]

Fish are probably the best-known inhabitants of lotic systems.  The ability of a fish species to live in flowing waters depends upon the speed at which it can swim and the duration that its speed can be maintained.  This ability can vary greatly between species and is tied to the habitat in which it can survive.  Continuous swimming expends a tremendous amount of energy and, therefore, fishes spend only short periods in full current.  Instead, individuals remain close to the bottom or the banks, behind obstacles, and sheltered from the current, swimming in the current only to feed or change locations.&lt;ref name=Ang /&gt; Some species have adapted to living only on the system bottom, never venturing into the open water flow.  These fishes are [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorso-ventrally]] flattened to reduce flow resistance and often have eyes on top of their heads to observe what is happening above them.  Some also have sensory barrels positioned under the head to assist in the testing of substratum.&lt;ref name=Brown1987/&gt;

Lotic systems typically connect to each other, forming a path to the ocean (spring → stream → river → ocean), and many fishes have life cycles that require stages in both fresh and salt water.  [[Salmon]], for example, are [[anadromous]] species that are born in freshwater but spend most of their adult life in the ocean, returning to fresh water only to spawn. [[Eel]]s are [[catadromous]] species that [[Eel life history|do the opposite]], living in freshwater as adults but migrating to the ocean to spawn.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;

Other vertebrate taxa that inhabit lotic systems include [[amphibian]]s, such as [[salamander]]s, [[reptile]]s (e.g. snakes, turtles, crocodiles and alligators) various bird species, and mammals (e.g., [[otter]]s, [[beaver]]s, [[hippopotamus|hippos]], and [[river dolphin]]s).  With the exception of a few species, these vertebrates are not tied to water as fishes are, and spend part of their time in terrestrial habitats.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; Many fish species are important as consumers and as prey species to the larger vertebrates mentioned above.

==Trophic relationships==

===Energy inputs===
[[File:ElodeaCanadensis.jpg|thumb|right|[[Elodea canadensis|Pondweed]] is an autochthonous energy source]]
[[File:Stream at the Walhalla ravine.jpg|thumb|right|Leaf litter is an allochthonous energy source]]

Energy sources can be [[Indigenous (ecology)|autochthonous]] or [[allochthonous]].

* '''Autochthonous''' (from the latin "auto" = "self) energy sources are those derived from within the lotic system.  During [[photosynthesis]], for example, [[primary producer]]s form organic carbon compounds out of carbon dioxide and inorganic matter.  The energy they produce is important for the community because it may be transferred to higher [[trophic level]]s via consumption. Additionally, high rates of [[primary production]] can introduce [[dissolved organic matter]] (DOM) to the waters.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt; Another form of autochthonous energy comes from the decomposition of dead organisms and feces that originate within the lotic system.  In this case, bacteria decompose the [[detritus]] or coarse [[particulate]] organic material (CPOM; &gt;1&amp;nbsp;mm pieces) into fine particulate organic  matter (FPOM; &lt;1&amp;nbsp;mm pieces) and then further into inorganic compounds that are required for photosynthesis.&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tank|first=Jennifer L.|last2=Rosi-Marshall|first2=Emma J.|last3=Griffiths|first3=Natalie A.|last4=Entrekin|first4=Sally A.|last5=Stephen|first5=Mia L.|date=March 2010|title=A review of allochthonous organic matter dynamics and metabolism in streams|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1899/08-170.1|journal=Journal of the North American Benthological Society|language=en|volume=29|issue=1|pages=118–146|doi=10.1899/08-170.1|issn=0887-3593}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is discussed in more detail below.
* '''Allochthonous''' energy sources are those derived from outside the lotic system, that is, from the terrestrial environment.  Leaves, twigs, fruits, etc. are typical forms of terrestrial CPOM that have entered the water by direct litter fall or lateral leaf blow.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;  In addition, terrestrial animal-derived materials, such as feces or carcasses that have been added to the system are examples of allochthonous CPOM.   The CPOM undergoes a specific process of degradation. Allan gives the example of a leaf fallen into a stream.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt; First, the soluble chemicals are dissolved and [[Leaching (chemical science)|leached]] from the leaf upon its saturation with water. This adds to the DOM load in the system. Next [[microbe]]s such as [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] [[colonize]] the leaf, softening it as the [[mycelium]] of the fungus grows into it.  The composition of the microbial community is influenced by the species of tree from which the leaves are shed (Rubbo and Kiesecker 2004).  This combination of bacteria, fungi, and leaf are a food source for [[invertebrate|shredding invertebrate]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. EPA|title=Classifications of Macroinvertebrates|url=http://www.epa.gov/bioiweb1/html/invertclass.html|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which leave only FPOM after consumption.  These fine particles may be colonized by microbes again or serve as a food source for animals that consume FPOM.  Organic matter can also enter the lotic system already in the FPOM stage by wind, [[surface runoff]], [[River bank|bank]] [[erosion]], or [[groundwater]].  Similarly, DOM can be introduced through [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] drip from rain or from surface flows&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;.

===Invertebrates===
[[Invertebrate]]s can be organized into many [[Guild (ecology)|feeding guilds]] in lotic systems.  Some species are shredders, which use large and powerful mouth parts to feed on non-woody CPOM and their associated microorganisms.  Others are [[Filter feeder|suspension feeder]]s, which use their [[setae]], filtering aparati, nets, or even secretions to collect FPOM and microbes from the water.  These species may be passive collectors, utilizing the natural flow of the system, or they may generate their own current to draw water, and also, FPOM in Allan.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt; Members of the gatherer-collector guild actively search for FPOM under rocks and in other places where the stream flow has slackened enough to allow deposition.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt; Grazing invertebrates utilize scraping, rasping, and browsing adaptations to feed on [[periphyton]] and [[detritus]]. Finally, several families are predatory, capturing and consuming animal prey. Both the number of species and the abundance of individuals within each guild is largely dependent upon food availability. Thus, these values may vary across both seasons and systems.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt;

===Fish===
Fish can also be placed into [[Guild (ecology)|feeding guilds]]. Planktivores pick [[plankton]] out of the [[water column]].  [[Herbivore]]-[[detritivore]]s are [[Bottom feeder|bottom-feeding]] species that ingest both [[periphyton]] and [[detritus]] indiscriminately.  Surface and water column feeders capture surface prey (mainly terrestrial and emerging insects) and drift ([[benthic]] invertebrates floating downstream).  Benthic invertebrate feeders prey primarily on immature insects, but will also consume other benthic invertebrates.  [[Apex predator|Top predators]] consume fishes and/or large invertebrates.  [[Omnivore]]s ingest a wide range of prey.  These can be [[floral]], [[fauna]]l, and/or  detrital in nature.  Finally, [[parasite]]s live off of host species, typically other fishes.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt; Fish are flexible in their feeding roles, capturing different prey with regard to seasonal availability and their own developmental stage.  Thus, they may occupy multiple feeding  guilds in their lifetime.  The number of species in each guild can vary greatly between systems, with temperate warm water streams having the most benthic invertebrate feeders, and tropical systems having large numbers of detritus feeders due to high rates of [[allochthonous]] input.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt;

===Local species richness===
Large rivers have comparatively more species than small streams.  Many relate this pattern to the greater area and volume of larger systems, as well as an increase in habitat diversity.  Some systems, however, show a poor fit between system size and [[species richness]].  In these cases, a combination of factors such as historical rates of [[speciation]] and [[extinction]], type of [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]], [[microhabitat]] availability, water chemistry, temperature, and disturbance such as flooding seem to be important.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;

===Resource partitioning===
Although many alternate theories have been postulated for the ability of [[Guild (ecology)|guild-mates]] to coexist (see Morin 1999), [[resource partitioning]] has been well documented in lotic systems as a means of reducing competition.   The three main types of resource partitioning include habitat, dietary, and temporal segregation.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;

[[Niche differentiation#Spatial partitioning|Habitat segregation]] was found to be the most common type of resource partitioning in natural systems (Schoener, 1974).  In lotic systems, microhabitats provide a level of physical complexity that can support a diverse array of organisms (Vincin and Hawknis, 1998).  The separation of species by substrate preferences has been well documented for invertebrates.  Ward (1992) was able to divide substrate dwellers into six broad assemblages, including those that live in: coarse substrate, gravel, sand, mud, woody debris, and those associated with plants, showing one layer of segregation.  On a smaller scale, further habitat partitioning can occur on or around a single substrate, such as a piece of gravel.  Some invertebrates prefer the high flow areas on the exposed top of the gravel, while others reside in the crevices between one piece of gravel and the next, while still others live on the bottom of this gravel piece.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;

Dietary segregation is the second-most common type of resource partitioning.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; High degrees of [[Niche differentiation#Morphological differentiation|morphological specializations]] or behavioral differences allow organisms to use specific resources.  The size of nets built by some species of invertebrate [[Filter feeder|suspension feeder]]s, for example, can filter varying particle size of FPOM from the water (Edington et al. 1984).  Similarly, members in the grazing guild can specialize in the harvesting of algae or detritus depending upon the morphology of their scraping apparatus.  In addition, certain species seem to show a preference for specific algal species.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;

[[Niche differentiation#Temporal partitioning|Temporal segregation]] is a less common form of resource partitioning, but it is nonetheless an observed phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; Typically, it accounts for coexistence by relating it to differences in life history patterns and the timing of maximum growth among guild mates.  Tropical fishes in [[Borneo]], for example, have shifted to shorter life spans in response to the [[ecological niche]] reduction felt with increasing levels of species richness in their ecosystem (Watson and Balon 1984).

===Persistence and succession===
Over long time scales, there is a tendency for species composition in pristine systems to remain in a stable state.&lt;ref&gt;Hildrew, A.G. and P.S. Giller.  1994.  Patchiness, species interactions and disturbance in the stream [[benthos]]. In Aquatic Ecology: scale pattern and process.  (P.S. Giller, A.G. Hildrew, and D.G. Rafaelli eds.) Blackwell, Oxford.  Pp. 21–62.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been found for both invertebrate and fish species.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; On shorter time scales, however, flow variability and unusual precipitation patterns decrease habitat stability and can all lead to declines in persistence levels. The ability to maintain this persistence over long time scales is related to the ability of lotic systems to return to the original community configuration relatively quickly after a disturbance (Townsend et al. 1987). This is one example of temporal succession, a site-specific change in a community involving changes in species composition over time.  Another form of temporal succession might occur when a new habitat is opened up for [[colonization]]. In these cases, an entirely new community that is well adapted to the conditions found in this new area can establish itself.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;

The [[River continuum concept]] (RCC) was an attempt to construct a single framework to describe the function of temperate lotic ecosystems from the headwaters to larger rivers and relate key characteristics to changes in the biotic community  (Vannote et al. 1980).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vannote|first=R.L|date=1980|title=The River Continuum Concept|url=|journal=Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences|volume=37|pages=|via=Canadian Science Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical basis for RCC is size and location along the gradient from a small stream eventually linked to a large river.  Stream order (see [[Stream#Characteristics of streams|characteristics of streams]]) is used as the physical measure of the position along the RCC.

According to the RCC, low ordered sites are small shaded streams where allochthonous inputs of CPOM are a necessary resource for consumers.  As the river widens at mid-ordered sites, energy inputs should change.  Ample sunlight should reach the bottom in these systems to support significant periphyton production.  Additionally, the biological processing of CPOM (Coarse Particulate Organic Matter - larger than 1&amp;nbsp;mm) inputs at upstream sites is expected to result in the transport of large amounts of FPOM (Fine Particulate Organic Matter - smaller than 1&amp;nbsp;mm) to these downstream ecosystems.  Plants should become more abundant at edges of the river with increasing river size, especially in lowland rivers where finer sediments have been deposited and facilitate rooting. The main channels likely have too much current and turbidity and a lack of substrate to support plants or periphyton.  Phytoplankton should produce the only autochthonous inputs here, but photosynthetic rates will be limited due to turbidity and mixing.  Thus, allochthonous inputs are expected to be the primary energy source for large rivers. This FPOM will come from both upstream sites via the decomposition process and through lateral inputs from floodplains.

Biota should change with this change in energy from the headwaters to the mouth of these systems.  Namely, shredders should prosper in low-ordered systems and grazers in mid-ordered sites.  Microbial decomposition should play the largest role in energy production for low-ordered sites and large rivers, while photosynthesis, in addition to degraded allochthonous inputs from upstream will be essential in mid-ordered systems.  As mid-ordered sites will theoretically receive the largest variety of energy inputs, they might be expected to host the most biological diversity (Vannote et al. 1980).&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;

Just how well the RCC actually reflects patterns in natural systems is uncertain and its generality can be a handicap when applied to diverse and specific situations.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt; The most noted criticisms of the RCC are: 1. It focuses mostly on [[macroinvertebrates]], disregarding that plankton and fish diversity is highest in high orders; 2. It relies heavily on the fact that low ordered sites have high CPOM inputs, even though many streams lack [[riparian]] habitats; 3. It is based on pristine systems, which rarely exist today; and 4. It is centered around the functioning of temperate streams.  Despite its shortcomings, the RCC remains a useful idea for describing how the patterns of ecological functions in a lotic system can vary from the source to the mouth.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt;

Disturbances such as congestion by dams or natural events such as shore flooding are not included in the RCC model.&lt;ref name="Junk J.W. 1989"&gt;Junk J.W., P.B. Bayley, R.E. Sparks: “The flood pulse concept in river flood plain systems”. Canadian Special Publications of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences. 106. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Various researchers have since expanded the model to account for such irregularities.  For example, J.V. Ward and J.A. Stanford came up with the Serial Discontinuity Concept in 1983, which addresses the impact of [[Geomorphology|geomorphologic]] disorders such as congestion and integrated inflows.  The same authors presented the Hyporheic Corridor concept in 1993, in which the vertical (in depth) and lateral (from shore to shore) structural complexity of the river were connected.&lt;ref&gt;Ward J.V., J.A. Stanford: The Serial Discontinuity Concept of River Ecosystems.  T.D. Fontaine, S.M. Bartell: “Dynamics of Lotic Ecosystems”. Science Publications, Ann Arbor Mich  29-42. 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[flood pulse concept]], developed by W.J. Junk in 1989, further modified by P.B. Bayley in 1990 and K. Tockner in 2000, takes into account the large amount of nutrients and organic material that makes its way into a river from the sediment of surrounding flooded land.&lt;ref name="Junk J.W. 1989"/&gt;

==Human impacts==

===Pollution===
River pollution can include but is not limited to: increasing sediment export, excess nutrients from fertilizer or urban runoff,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fertilizer-runoff-overwhelms-streams/|title=Fertilizer Runoff Overwhelms Streams and Rivers--Creating Vast "Dead Zones"|last=Biello|first=David|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; sewage and septic inputs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2015/septic-tanks-arent-keeping-poo-out-of-rivers-and-lakes/|title=Septic tanks aren't keeping poo out of rivers and lakes|last=University|first=Michigan State|work=MSUToday|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; plastic pollution,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/growing-concern-over-plastic-pollution-in-rivers-and-lakes|title=Growing Concern over Plastic Pollution in Rivers and Lakes|work=The Maritime Executive|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; nano-particles, pharmaceuticals and personal care products,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolpin|first=Dana W.|last2=Furlong|first2=Edward T.|last3=Meyer|first3=Michael T.|last4=Thurman|first4=E.

Pollutant sources of lotic systems are hard to control because they can derive, often in small amounts, over a very wide area and enter the system at many locations along its length. While direct pollution of lotic systems has been greatly reduced in the United States under the government’s [[Clean Water Act]], contaminants from diffuse non-point sources remain a large problem.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt; Agricultural fields often deliver large quantities of sediments, nutrients, and chemicals to nearby streams and rivers. Urban and residential areas can also add to this pollution when contaminants are accumulated on impervious surfaces such as roads and parking lots that then drain into the system.  Elevated nutrient concentrations, especially nitrogen and phosphorus which are key components of fertilizers, can increase periphyton growth, which can be particularly dangerous in slow-moving streams.&lt;ref name="Cush" /&gt; Another pollutant, [[acid rain]], forms from sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide emitted from factories and power stations.  These substances readily dissolve in atmospheric moisture and enter lotic systems through precipitation. This can lower the pH of these sites, affecting all trophic levels from algae to vertebrates.&lt;ref name=Brown1987/&gt; Mean species richness and total species numbers within a system decrease with decreasing pH.&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt;

===Flow modification===
[[File:River Calder Weir.JPG|thumb|right|A [[weir]] on the [[River Calder, West Yorkshire|River Calder]], [[West Yorkshire]]]]

Flow modification can occur as a result of [[Dam|dams]], water regulation and extraction, channel modification, and the destruction of the river floodplain and adjacent riparian zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.niwa.co.nz/our-science/freshwater/tools/kaitiaki_tools/impacts/in-stream-barriers/changes-in-flow|title=Altered water flow (hydrology)|date=2009-07-06|work=NIWA|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Dam]]s alter the flow, temperature, and sediment regime of lotic systems.&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt; Additionally, many rivers are dammed at multiple locations, amplifying the impact. Dams can cause enhanced clarity and reduced variability in stream flow, which in turn cause an increase in [[periphyton]] abundance.  \Invertebrates immediately below a dam can show reductions in species richness due to an overall reduction in habitat heterogeneity.&lt;ref name="Cush" /&gt;  Also, thermal changes can affect insect development, with abnormally warm winter temperatures obscuring cues to break egg [[diapause]] and overly cool summer temperatures leaving too few acceptable days to complete growth.&lt;ref name="Allan" /&gt; Finally, dams fragment river systems, isolating previously continuous populations, and preventing the migrations of [[anadromous]] and [[catadromous]] species.&lt;ref name="Cush" /&gt;

===Invasive species===
[[Invasive species]] have been introduced to lotic systems through both purposeful events (e.g. stocking game and food species) as well as unintentional events (e.g. hitchhikers on boats or fishing waders).  These organisms can affect natives via competition for prey or habitat, predation, habitat alteration, hybridization, or the introduction of harmful diseases and parasites.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; Once established, these species can be difficult to control or eradicate, particularly because of the connectivity of lotic systems.   Invasive species can be especially harmful in areas that have [[endangered]] biota, such as mussels in the Southeast United States, or those that have localized [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species, like lotic systems west of the Rocky Mountains, where many species evolved in isolation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14269">The '''Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf''' was (despite the name) the first international [[Meeting|conference]] of [[deaf]] educators held in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] in 1880. It is commonly known as "the '''Milan Conference'''". After deliberations from September 6 to 11, 1880, the conference declared that [[oral education]] (oralism) was superior to [[sign language|manual education]] and passed a resolution banning the use of sign language in school. After its passage in 1880, [[schools]] in European countries and [[History of deaf education in the United States|the United States]] switched to using [[speech therapy]] without [[sign language]] as a method of [[education for the deaf]]. A formal apology was made by the board at the 21st International Congress on Education of the Deaf in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, BC, Canada]], in 2010 accepting the dangerous ramifications of such ban as an act of discrimination and violation of human and constitutional rights.

== Background ==

[[Alexander Graham Bell]] and [[Edward Miner Gallaudet]], both prominent U.S. figures in deaf education, had been debating the effectiveness of oral-only education versus an education that utilizes [[sign language]] as a means of visual communication, culminating in the Milan Conference in 1880 that passed eight resolutions on deaf education.

The Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf (which, despite its name, was actually the first) was an international meeting of deaf educators from at least seven countries. There were five delegates from America and approximately 164 delegates total in attendance. The Congress was planned and organized by a committee created by the Pereire Society, a group that was against sign language. More than half of the people invited were known oralists; therefore, the Congress was biased and most, if not all, of the resolutions that were voted on by the delegates gave results in favor of the oral method. Many of the resolutions were worded in ways that supported the oral method, such as "Considering the incontestable superiority of speech over signs in restoring the deaf-mute to society, and in giving him a more perfect knowledge of language,/Declares –/That the Oral method ought to be preferred that of signs for the education and instruction of the deaf and dumb".&lt;ref name=Milan1880&gt;

{{cite web |url=http://milan1880.com/milan1880congress/eightresolutions.html |title=Eight Resolutions |last=Sturley |first=Nick |year=2010 |work=Milan 1880 |publisher= |accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Milan Conference was organized by the Pereire Society, an organization formed by the family of [[Jacob Rodrigues Pereira]] of France and financed by their numerous railroad and bank holdings (including the [[Société Générale du Crédit Mobilier]]). The Pereire Society was a strong supporter of oralism. They organized the Milan conference with the intent to ban sign language. They secured this outcome by carefully selecting who was invited, inviting the delegates to see the oralist success in a local school, and by encouraging negative reactions to those giving speeches supporting sign language and cheering those supporting [[oralism]].

== Delegates ==

The Milan Conference was attended by 164 delegates of various countries. Out of these 164 delegates only one, James Denison, was deaf. The conference president was [[Abbot|Abbe]] Giulio Tarra.

The nationality of the remaining delegates is unknown. The five U.S. delegates present were James Denison, [[Edward Miner Gallaudet]], [[Thomas Gallaudet (1822–1902)|Reverend Thomas Gallaudet]], Isaac Lewis Peet and Charles A Stoddard.

== Conference ==

The Conference was held in the Regio Instituto Tenico di Santa Martha, Milan. It was held from 6 September to 11 September 1880. The aim of the conference was to ban sign language from deaf education. During the conference there were 12 speakers who gave their opinions on the issues connected with deaf education. Nine of the twelve speakers gave an oralist view, and three (the Gallaudet father and son, and Richard Elliot, a teacher from England) supported the use of sign language.

== Eight resolutions ==

1. The Convention, considering the incontestable superiority of articulation over signs in restoring the deaf-mute to society and giving him a fuller knowledge of language, declares that the oral method should be preferred to that of signs in education and the instruction of deaf-mutes.
::Passed 160 to 4

2. The Convention, considering that the simultaneous use of articulation and signs has the disadvantage of injuring articulation and lip-reading and the precision of ideas, declares that the pure oral method should be preferred.
::Passed 150 to 16

3. Considering that a great number of the deaf and dumb are not receiving the benefit of instruction, and that this condition is owing to the impotence of [[family|families]] and of [[institution]]s, recommends that [[government]]s should take the necessary steps that all the deaf and dumb may be educated.
::Passed unanimously.

4. Considering that the teaching of the speaking deaf by the Pure Oral method should resemble as much as possible that of those who hear and speak, declares 
:a) That the most natural and effectual means by which the speaking deaf may acquire the knowledge of language is the "intuitive" method, viz., that which consists in setting forth, first by [[speech]], and then by writing the objects and the facts which are placed before the eyes of the pupils.
:b) That in the first, or maternal, period the [[deaf]]-[[Muteness|mute]] ought to be led to the observation of [[grammar|grammatical]] forms by means of examples and of practical exercises, and that in the second period he ought to be assisted to deduce from these examples the grammatical rules, expressed with the utmost simplicity and clearness.
:c) That books, written with words and in forms of [[language]] known to the pupil, can be put into his hands at any time.
::Motion carried.

5. Considering the want of books sufficiently elementary to help the gradual and progressive development of language, recommends that the [[teacher]]s of the Oral system should apply themselves to the publication of special works on the subject.
::Motion carried.

6. Considering the results obtained by the numerous inquiries made concerning the deaf and dumb of every age and every condition long after they had quit school, who, when interrogated upon various subjects, have answered correctly, with sufficient clearness of articulation, and [[lip reading|read]] the lips of their questioners with the greatest facility, declares:
:a) That the deaf and dumb taught by the Pure Oral method do not forget after leaving school the knowledge which they have acquired there, but develop it still further by conversation and reading, when have been made so easy for them.
:b) That in their [[conversation]] with [[speech|speaking]] persons they make use exclusively of speech.
:c) That speech and lip-reading so far from being lost, are developed by practice.
::Motion carried.

7. Considering that the education of the deaf and dumb by speech has peculiar requirements; considering also that the experienced of teachers of deaf-mutes is almost unanimous, declares
:a) That the most favourable age for admitting a deaf child into school is from eight to ten years.
:b) That the school term ought to be seven years at least; but eight years would be preferable.
:c) That no teacher can effectually teach a class of more than ten children on the Pure Oral method.
::Motion carried.

8. Considering that the application of the Pure Oral method in institutions where it is not yet in active operation, should be to avoid the certainty of failure prudent, gradual, progressive, recommends 
:a) That the pupils newly received into the schools should form a class by themselves, where instruction could be given by speech.
:b) That these pupils should be absolutely separated from others too far advanced to be instructed by speech, and whose education will be completed by signs.
:c) That each year a new speaking class be established, until all the old pupils taught by signs have completed their education.
::Motion carried.

== Opposition ==

Delegates from the [[United States]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]] were the only ones who opposed the use of oralism as a sole method of instruction, but were unsuccessful in their efforts at the congress. Edward Miner Gallaudet and Reverend Thomas Gallaudet were among the protesters who fought against the oralist method. Since failing to overturn the Milan resolutions, Gallaudet ensured that the United States would not be completely converted to oralism-only, which included allowing high school students in institutes for the deaf to use sign language and maintaining [[Gallaudet University|Gallaudet College]] (now Gallaudet University) as a [[university]] that permits full usage of [[sign language]].

The [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] was also formed in the United States in response to the Milan Conference and was dedicated toward preserving [[American Sign Language]].

== First repudiation 100 years later in Hamburg ==

At the 15th International Congress on the Education of the Deaf (ICED) held in Hamburg, West Germany in 1980, the first major precedent for the repudiation of the 1880 resolutions was set by a large group of attendees who rejected the 1880 resolutions in practical-moral terms by the method of informal consensus in deciding that the 1880 resolutions had no appropriate standing, originally, in 1880. As explained by Richard G. Brill: "At the International Congress in Hamburg in 1980, however, the Milan resolutions were challenged head-on in major professional addresses at the opening of the congresses. It was recognized and accepted that resolutions concerning methodology were not appropriate at such international congresses because of the unlikelihood that the delegates fully represented the practices and philosophies of their home countries."&lt;ref&gt;Brill, Richard G. 1984. ''International Congresses on Education of the Deaf--An Analytical History, 1878-1980'', Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garretson, Merv. 2010. ''My Yesterdays'', Xlibris, pp. 127-128.{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than seek to directly overturn the 1880s resolutions, the Congress put forward "Recommendations" for informational purposes, including the following: "Recommended that this International Congress on Education of the Deaf, in convocation gathered at Hamburg, West Germany, in August 1980, affirms and declares that all deaf children have the right to flexible communication in the mode or combination of modes which best meets their individual needs."&lt;ref&gt;Brill, Richard G. 1984. ''International Congresses on Education of the Deaf--An Analytical History, 1878-1980'', Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press, p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; Sharkey and Hikins deemed this Recommendation, along with the others, as constituting overturning the 1880 Milan Congress's resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;Sharkey, William F. and James W. Hikins. 1993. Edward Miner Gallaudet's "Remarks on the Combined System": An Analysis of the "Preservative" Function of Rhetoric of Education, ''Communication Education'', Vol. 42, No. 1, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the previous precedent set in 1980, in July 2010 in Vancouver, Canada, the board of the 21st International Congress on the Education of the Deaf (ICED) formally voted to reject all of the 1880 Milan resolutions.&lt;ref name="ICED"&gt;Tucker, James.

'''Strategic geography''' is concerned with the control of, or access to, spatial areas that affect the [[national security|security]] and prosperity of [[nation]]s. Spatial areas that concern strategic geography change with human needs and development. This field is a subset of [[human geography]], itself a subset of the more general study of [[geography]].  It is also related to [[geostrategy]].

Strategic geography is that branch of science, which deals with the study of spatial areas that affect the security and prosperity of a nation.

'''Systems ecology''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] field of [[ecology]], a subset of [[Earth system science]], that takes a [[holism|holistic]] approach to the study of ecological systems, especially [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Shugart, Herman H., and Robert V. O'Neill. "Systems ecology". Dowden, Hutchingon &amp; Ross, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Dyne, George M. "Ecosystems, Systems Ecology, and Systems Ecologists". ORNL- 3975.

Central to the systems ecology approach is the idea that an ecosystem is a [[complex system]] exhibiting [[emergent properties]].  Systems ecology focuses on interactions and transactions within and between biological and ecological systems, and is especially concerned with the way the functioning of ecosystems can be influenced by human interventions.  It uses and extends concepts from [[thermodynamics]] and develops other macroscopic descriptions of complex systems.

==Overview==
Systems ecology seeks a [[Holism|holistic]] view of the interactions and transactions within and between biological and ecological systems. Systems ecologists realise that the function of any ecosystem can be influenced by human economics in fundamental ways.  They have therefore taken an additional transdisciplinary step by including economics in the consideration of [[ecological economics|ecological-economic]] systems. In the words of [[R.L. Kitching]]:&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Kitching 1983, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Systems ecology can be defined as the approach to the study of ecology of organisms using the techniques and philosophy of systems analysis: that is, the methods and tools developed, largely in engineering, for studying, characteriszing and making predictions about complex entities, that is, systems..
* ''In any study of an ecological system, an essential early procedure is to draw a diagram of the system of interest ... diagrams indicate the system's '''boundaries''' by a solid line. Within these boundaries, series of components are isolated which have been chosen to represent that portion of the world in which the systems analyst is interested ... If there are no connections across the systems' boundaries with the surrounding '''systems environments''', the systems are described as ''closed''. Ecological work, however, deals almost exclusively with ''open'' systems.''&lt;ref&gt;(Kitching 1983, p.11)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a mode of scientific enquiry, a central feature of Systems Ecology is the general application of the [[principles of energetics]] to all systems at any scale. Perhaps the most notable proponent of this view was [[Howard T. Odum]] - sometimes considered the father of ecosystems ecology. In this approach the principles of energetics constitute [[ecosystem principles]]. Reasoning by [[formal analogy]] from one system to another enables the Systems Ecologist to see principles functioning in an analogous manner across system-scale boundaries. H.T. Odum commonly used the [[Energy Systems Language]] as a tool for making systems diagrams and flow charts.

The fourth of these principles, the [[Maximum power principle|principle of maximum power efficiency]], takes central place in the analysis and synthesis of ecological systems. The fourth principle suggests that the most evolutionarily advantageous system function occurs when the environmental load matches the internal resistance of the system. The further the environmental load is from matching the internal resistance, the further the system is away from its sustainable steady state. Therefore, the systems ecologist engages in a task of resistance and impedance matching in [[ecological engineering]], just as the [[electronic engineer]] would do.

===Deep ecology===
{{Main article|Deep ecology}}

Deep ecology is an ideology whose metaphysical underpinnings are deeply concerned with the science of ecology. The term was coined by [[Arne Næss|Arne Naess]], a Norwegian philosopher, [[Gandhi]]an scholar, and [[environmental activist]]. He argues that the prevailing approach to [[environmental management]] is [[anthropocentric]], and that the natural environment is not only "more complex than we imagine, it is more complex than we can imagine."&lt;ref&gt;A statement attributed to British biologist [[J.B.S. Haldane]]&lt;/ref&gt; Naess formulated deep ecology in 1973 at an environmental conference in Budapest.

[[Joanna Macy]], [[John Seed]], and others developed Naess' thesis into a branch they called ''experiential deep ecology''. Their efforts were motivated by a need they perceived for the development of an "[[ecological self]]", which views the human ego as an integrated part of a living system that encompasses the individual. They sought to transcend [[altruism]] with a deeper self-interest based on [[biospherical equality]] beyond human chauvinism.

===Earth systems engineering and management===
{{Main article|Earth systems engineering and management}}
Earth systems engineering and management (ESEM) is a discipline used to analyze, design, engineer and manage [[Complexity|complex]] [[Natural environment|environmental]] [[system]]s.  It entails a wide range of subject areas including anthropology, engineering, [[environmental science]], ethics and philosophy. At its core, ESEM looks to "rationally design and manage coupled human-natural systems in a highly integrated and ethical fashion"

===Ecological economics===
{{Main article|Ecological economics}}
Ecological economics is a transdisciplinary field of academic research that addresses the dynamic and spatial interdependence between human economies and natural [[ecosystem]]s. Ecological economics brings together and connects different disciplines, within the natural and social sciences but especially between these broad areas. As the name suggests, the field is made up of researchers with a background in [[economics]] and [[ecology]]. An important motivation for the emergence of ecological economics has been criticism on the assumptions and approaches of traditional (mainstream) [[Environmental economics|environmental and resource economics]].

===Ecological energetics===
{{Main article|Ecological energetics}}
Ecological energetics is the quantitative study of the flow of energy through ecological systems. It aims to uncover the [[Scientific law|principles]] which describe the propensity of such energy flows through the trophic, or 'energy availing' levels of ecological networks. In systems ecology the principles of ecosystem energy flows or "ecosystem laws" (i.e. principles of ecological energetics) are considered formally analogous to the [[principles of energetics]].

===Ecological humanities===
{{Main article|Ecological humanities}}
Ecological humanities aims to bridge the divides between the sciences and the humanities, and between [[Western culture|Western]], [[Eastern culture|Eastern]] and [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] ways of knowing nature. Like ecocentric political theory, the ecological humanities are characterised by a connectivity ontology and a commitment to two fundamental axioms relating to the need to submit to [[Ecology|ecological]] laws and to see humanity as part of a larger living system.

===Ecosystem ecology===

[[File:Ecoecolfigure1.jpg|thumb|right|A [[riparian forest]] in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]], [[New Hampshire]] (USA)]]
{{Main article|Ecosystem ecology}}
Ecosystem ecology is the integrated study of [[Life|biotic]] and [[abiotic]] components of [[ecosystem]]s and their interactions within an ecosystem framework. This [[science]] examines how ecosystems work and relates this to their components such as [[chemical]]s, [[bedrock]], [[soil]], [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s. Ecosystem ecology examines physical and biological structure and examines how these ecosystem characteristics interact.

The relationship between systems ecology and ecosystem ecology is complex.  Much of systems ecology can be considered a subset of ecosystem ecology.  Ecosystem ecology also utilizes methods that have little to do with the holistic approach of systems ecology.  However, systems ecology more actively considers external influences such as economics that usually fall outside the bounds of ecosystem ecology.  Whereas ecosystem ecology can be defined as the scientific study of ecosystems, systems ecology is more of a particular approach to the study of ecological systems and phenomena that interact with these systems.

===Industrial ecology===
{{Main article|Industrial ecology}}
Industrial ecology is the study of [[industrial process]]es as linear (open loop) systems, in which resource and capital investments move through the system to become waste, to a closed loop system where wastes become inputs for new processes.

'''''The Analysis of Beauty''''' is a book written by the 18th-century artist and writer [[William Hogarth]], published in 1753, which describes Hogarth's theories of visual beauty and grace in a manner accessible to the common man of his day.

==The "Line of Beauty"==

Prominent among Hogarth's ideas of beauty was the theory of the [[Line of Beauty]]; an S-shaped (serpentine) curved line  that excited the attention of the viewer and evoked liveliness and movement. ''The Analysis of Beauty'' formed the intellectual centrepiece of what the historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] described as Hogarth's "grim campaign against fashionable taste",{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} which Hogarth himself described as his "War with the Connoisseurs".{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Six principles==

In ''The Analysis of Beauty'' Hogarth implements six principles that independently affect beauty. Although he concurs that those principles have an effect, he is not determinate on their specific influence. The first principle of beauty Hogarth describes is '''fitness''', which is not in itself a source of beauty, but can be described as a material cause of it. Though the account of fitness on the total beauty of an object is only moderate, it is a necessary cause. Fitness does not necessarily imply purpose. However, improperly implied forms cannot be the source of beauty. It is in this that the necessity of fitness must be seen: if not accounted for, a form cannot readily be assumed beautiful.

The second major principle of beauty is '''variety'''. It is the source of beauty, which Hogarth shows us by the contrary notion of "sameness": "sameness", a lack of variety, offends the senses. "The ear is as much offended with one even continued note, as the eye is with being fix'd to a point, or to the view of a dead wall."&lt;ref&gt;Hogarth, William, ''The Analysis of Beauty'', Ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, our senses find relief in discovering a certain amount of "sameness" within a varietal experience.

The third notion of '''regularity''' is understood as a form of "composed variety": it only pleases us when it is suggestive to fitness. Similar to this notion in effect is '''simplicity''', which enhances the pleasure of variety in that it pleases the eye. The variety which causes a beautiful experience should, so to speak, be tempered by simplicity. On the other hand: simplicity without variety at best does only not displease.

'''Intricacy''' is a strange principle in that it does not directly follow from the formal behaviour of a beautiful object. Hogarth means by this the habit which causes us to end up in the whirling game of pursuit, when bit by bit discovering the beauty of an object. Intricacy arises from the love of this pursuit. Every difficulty in understanding or grasping the object enhances the pleasure of overcoming it, to continue the pursuit. There is a direct connection here to the [[Line of Beauty]] Hogarth dictates, along which every image is built up. Though the movement of our eye is discrete in itself, the movement of our "Mind's eye" follows a duplicate course of the line, a principal ray of light moving along with the line of sight. The continuous movement of our "Mind's eye" triggers the notion of intricacy.

'''Quantity''', finally, is associated with the notion of the [[sublime (literary)|sublime]], which, when Hogarth's book appeared, was not yet entirely distinguished from the apprehension of beauty. Hogarth thus does not speak of sublimity, but of '''greatness'''. He recognises a great quantity to have an aesthetic effect on the beholder without the necessity of a varietal or fitting form. This should not be exaggerated, as that might lead to absurdities.

'''''The Lost Books of the Bible and the Forgotten Books of Eden''''' (1926) is a collection of 17th-century and 18th-century English translations of some [[Old Testament Pseudepigrapha]] and [[New Testament Apocrypha]], some of which were assembled in the 1820s, and then republished with the current title in 1926.

==History of the translations==
Rutherford Hayes Platt, in the preface to his 1963 reprint of ''The Lost Books of the Bible and the Forgotten Books of Eden'' states:
:"First issued in 1926, this is the most popular collection of apocryphal and pseudepigraphal literature ever published."
The translations were first published, under this title, by an unknown editor in ''The Lost Books of the Bible'' Cleveland 1926, but the translations had previously been published many times. 

The book is, essentially, a combined reprint of earlier works.  The first half, ''Lost Books of the Bible'', is an unimproved reprint of a book published by [[William Hone]] in 1820, titled ''The Apocryphal New Testament'', itself a reprint of a translation of the [[Apostolic Fathers]] done in 1693 by [[William Wake]], who later became the Archbishop of Canterbury, and a smattering of medieval embellishments on the New Testament, from a book  by [[Jeremiah Jones (tutor)|Jeremiah Jones]] (1693-1724), posthumously published in 1736. In the three centuries since these were originally published, a great deal more is known about the [[Apostolic Fathers]] (including a good deal of the original text that was not available in 1693) and New Testament apocrypha.

The second half of the book, ''The Forgotten Books of Eden'', includes a translation originally published in 1882 of the "First and Second Books of Adam and Eve", translated first from ancient Ethiopic to German by [[Ernest Trumpp]] and then into English by [[Solomon Caesar Malan]], and a number of items of Old Testament pseudepigrapha, such as reprinted in the second volume of [[Robert Charles (scholar)|R.H. Charles]]'s ''Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament'' (Oxford, 1913).

More modern translations of these works include [[James H. Charlesworth|J. H. Charlesworth]], ed. ''Old Testament Pseudepigrapha''; [[Wilhelm Schneemelcher|W. Schneemelcher]], ed. ''New Testament Apocrypha''; and [[M. R. James]],  ''The Apocryphal New Testament''.

'''Tracers''' are used in the [[oil industry]] in order to qualitatively or quantitatively gauge how fluid flows through the reservoir, as well as being a useful tool for estimating [[Reservoir engineers|residual oil saturation]].  Tracers can be used in either interwell tests or single well tests.  In interwell tests, the tracer is injected at one [[Oil well|well]] along with the carrier fluid (water in a waterflood or gas in a gasflood) and detected at a producing well after some period of time, which can be anything from days to years.  In single well [[Amott test|tests]], tracer is injected into the formation from a well and then produced out the same well. The delay between a tracer that does not react with the formation (a conservative tracer) and one that does (a partitioning tracer) will give an indication of residual oil saturation, a piece of information that is difficult to acquire by other means.

Tracers can be radioactive or chemical, gas or liquid and have been used extensively in the oil industry and hydrology for decades.

Women have made significant contributions to [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]], a genre which predates Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]]' arrival in Latin America in 1492 and the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. The earliest musicians were [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], hundreds of [[ethnic group]]s across the continent, whose lyrics "reflect conflict, beauty, pain, and loss that mark all [[human experience]]." Indigenous communities reserved [[women in music|music for women]], who were given equal opportunities with men to teach, perform, sing, and dance. [[Ethnomusicologist]]s have measured ceramic, animal-bone, and cane [[flute]]s from the [[Inca Empire]] which indicate a preference for women with a high [[vocal range]]. Women had equal [[social status]], were trained, and received the same opportunities in music as men in indigenous communities until the arrival of Columbus in the late 15th century. European settlers brought patriarchal, [[machismo]] ideologies to the continent, replacing the idea of equality between men and women. They equated [[Native American music|native music]] with "savagery" and European music with "civilization". Female musicians tended to be darker-skinned as a result of the [[slave trade]] (which increased the population of [[African slaves]]), and contemporary society denigrated music as a profession. Latin music became Africanized, with [[syncopated]] [[rhythm (music)|rhythms]] and [[call-and-response]]; European settlement introduced [[harmony]] and the Spanish [[décima]] song form.

Since the [[history of sound recording|pre-recording era of music]], Latin music was male-dominated, and there are relatively few examples of female [[songwriter]]s, [[music producer]]s, [[record executive]]s, and [[music promoter|promoters]]. Women lacked access to musical training; music programs were nonexistent, and cultural norms discouraged female participation. Latin music had a primarily male presence; men discriminated against women, limiting them to singing or dancing and discouraging them from becoming [[instrumentalist]]s, writers, [[List of women composers|composers]], [[music arranger|arrangers]], and executives. Women artists in the sub-genres of Latin music, such as [[Selena]], [[Jenni Rivera]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Ivy Queen]], [[Julieta Venegas]], and [[Ely Guerra]]. have been credited with enhancing the genres' female presence; they have broken through barriers, reshaping Latin music and public perceptions of [[female sexuality]], gender, and [[femininity]]. Women in [[salsa music]] are significantly underrepresented in the industry as very few women, with the exception of [[Celia Cruz]], have been associated with the emergence of the genre; for example, in the British documentary ''Salsa: Latin Pop Music in the Cites'' (1985), Cruz is one of the only female singers who is mentioned.

Women Latin singers have a significant demographic imbalance on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[music charts]] compared with their male counterparts. As radio formats explore genres popularized and led by men, such as [[reggaeton]] and [[regional Mexican music]], women on the ''Billboard'' Latin music charts are periodically absent. The last female singer with a number-one single was [[Sofia Reyes]], whose collaborative "[[Solo Yo]]" ended a five-year drought on the [[Latin Pop Songs]] chart in 2016. A year earlier, on the 50-position [[Hot Latin Songs]] chart, 22 weeks passed without a song by a women. Reyes has expressed concern about the disparity between male and female performances at Latin music award shows, noting that 90 percent of the performers are male. Other female singers, such as [[Chiquis Rivera]], have attributed the decline in visibility of women in Latin music to  [[sexist]] radio programmers. Latin music executive Alexandra Lioutikoff believes that the decline is due to a lack of female collaboration. Latin music remains male-dominated, and the [[music industry]] has "prejudiced practice" limiting female recording artists.

== Characteristics ==
Latin American music is varied; it includes thirty countries, influenced by [[European music|European]], [[African American music|African]], and [[Native American music|Amerindian]] cultures.{{sfn|Roberts|1999|p=3}} Latin music uses two European languages: [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], though modern-day widely distinguishes the genre as primarily sung or recorded in Spanish and to a lesser extent [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]].{{sfn|Roberts|1999|p=3}} Although heterogeneous, Latin music commonly includes the Spanish [[décima]] song form, African [[syncopation|syncopated]] [[rhythm (music)|rhythms]] and [[call-and-response]], and European [[harmony (music)|harmony]].{{sfn|Miller|2008|p=254}}

=== Pre-Columbian Latin America ===
[[File:Peru Tembladera Figure flute player DMA 1971-19.jpg|thumb|alt=Squat, reddish ceramic figurine of a person holding a flute|Pre-Columbian ceramic figurine of a Peruvian flute player]]
Pre-modern Latin music refers to music made by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]],{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=1}} hundreds of [[ethnic group]]s across the continent.{{sfn|Navarro|Sánchez|Ali|1999|p=5}} The first inhabitants of Latin America settled 30,000 years before the arrival of Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] at the peak of native cultural diversification into simple and complex societies.{{sfn|Preston|2014|p=11}} These societies included sedentary agricultural tribes and [[hunter gatherers]],{{sfn|Preston|2014|p=11}} who sang [[prayer]]s to a deity asking for prosperity{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=1}} with lyrics of "conflict, beauty, pain, and loss that mark all human experience" and music reflecting their understanding of the universe.{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=5}} They had "intricate ways of explaining the relationships between the sound, social organization, time, and the sacred",{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=5}} and their rituals included dramatized performances of mythology vocalizing their view of [[creationism|creation]].{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=8}} The creation myth of the [[Keres people]] of [[Laguna Pueblo]] (present west-central [[New Mexico]]) describes "the unformed cosmos as the domain of [[Tse che nako]] (Thought Woman or Spider Woman) who [[chant]]s life into two sacred bundles that become the sisters [[Keres (mythology)|Uretsete and Naosete]] (She Who Matters and She Who Remembers)."{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=8}}

Indigenous communities predating Columbus' arrival reserved [[women in music|music for women]], although men were equally involved in dance.{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=170}} During the [[Inca Empire]] in the mid-14th century, women from royal families and selected ''acallas'' (chosen ones) were taught science, art, poetry, and music from "wise elders".{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} The "chosen ones" were selected for their beauty and "quality of their voices."{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} There were six houses, one of which was called the ''taquiaclla'' (''taqui'' means "song"),&lt;!-- In what language? --&gt; which housed girls aged nine to fifteen with "gifted" singing voices.{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} The [[Andean civilizations|Andeans]] preferred young women with a high [[vocal range]].{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} Although no scripts or musical notation survive, archaeologists have uncovered a variety of ceramic, animal bone, and cane [[flute]]s.{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} [[Ethnomusicologist]]s who have measured the flutes have found their [[pitch (music)|pitch]] compatible with a high vocal range.{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} Women in these communities were well-treated,{{sfn|Tompkins|Foster|2001|p=34}} with equal opportunities to teach, perform, sing, and dance (as soloists, with other women, or in pairs with men).{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=139}} Female singers had a social status equal to men, receiving musical training and opportunities with their male counterparts.{{sfn|Sturman|2015}}

[[File:Columbus landing on Hispaniola adj.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Europeans and natives meeting, with ships and a missionary cross in the background|Christopher Columbus' arrival in the Americas and Spanish colonization brought patriarchy and machismo to Latin music.]]
Columbus' arrival in 1492 and the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] brought [[patriarchy]] and [[machismo]] to the continent, overriding sexual equality.{{sfn|Tompkins|Foster|2001|p=34}} Early [[Music of Spain|Spanish music]] described women as "property and mistrusted [by men]."{{sfn|Sturman|2015}} In a song, "Delgadina", women are servants who must please their men "no matter the cost."{{sfn|Sturman|2015}} According to author Janet Sturman, the Iberian idea of machismo (in which a strong man is superior to others, including women) was held by the [[conquistadors]].{{sfn|Sturman|2015}} Europeans who settled in the [[New World]] associated native music with "savagery" and European music with "civilization".{{sfn|Berglund|Johnson|Lee|2016|p=17}} During the [[slave trade]], musicians in Latin America primarily had a dark complexion.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=154}} This was due to an increased population of African slaves and contemporary society's view of music as a profession.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=154}} Most slaves arriving in Brazil were "bi-musical",&lt;!-- "Bi-musical" needs explanation. --&gt; and introduced their music to [[Music of Brazil|the country]].{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=154}} Rural [[Quechua language|Quechua]]-speaking [[Bolivia]]n farmers sang about European resistance in songs with Native American and European influences.{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=439}} [[Dark skin|Black]] Bolivians sang songs with lyrics reflecting a European influence, performed as Africanized European music.{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=439}}

In colonial Latin America, [[nun]]s wrote, directed, and performed music.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=102}} They played a variety of instruments, including the [[clavichord]], [[harp]], [[flageolet]], and flute.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=102}} The nuns played in front of spectators, choirs, and high-ranking government officials.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=102}} Musically-adept, underprivileged women were allowed to perform during the nuns' [[Christmas]] recital.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=102}} Performances were often "feminine acts", such as sewing, embroidery, bakery, and selling "special confections."{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=102}} For two hundred years in Latin America, the "elite woman" was educated in the arts; "the rest" were consigned to cooking, sewing, spinning, weaving, embroidery, and music.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=167}} In 17th- and 18th-century [[Mexico City]], music was often heard by visitors.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=50}} The music emanated from cathedral choirs, indigenous dancers, or black musicians organized in the city.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=50}} During the 17th century, Europeans and their descendants wrote and performed music at cathedrals in Mexico's cities which was repeated in song by [[black people|blacks]], [[mulatto]]s, indigenous Mexicans, [[Asian people|Asians]], and ethnicities.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=49}} In 1690, Mexican author [[Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz]] wrote secular and religious poetry, plays, philosophy, and theology.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=103}} She often discussed topics ranging from mathematics to music with visitors, had no interest in marriage and wanted to pursue "a life of the mind."{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=103}} Although her views were suppressed, de la Cruz defended [[women's rights]] in education.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=103}}

At a 1691 celebration, European traveler Juan de Galde described his participation in dancing and singing and placing a [[scapular]] on two young women in Mexico.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=50}} A Mexican singer named Reina performed for six hours, which made "the event more enjoyable".{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|pp=50-51}} The "wild" celebration banned [[Jamaicans]] from entry.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=51}} In 1697, Neapolitan chronicler Gemelli Carreri wrote during his trip off the coast of the [[Dominican Republic]] that he saw a canoe of musicians trying to outdo each other in singing and drawing attention to their "perfection".{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=50}} In 1799 [[Buenos Aires]], privileged women were encouraged to educate themselves in the arts.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=170}} The government required that women be taught to read and write, in addition to physical education and music.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=170}}

Since the arrival of European settlers, Latin music has been male-dominated.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} Musical training was nonexistent for women.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} Male predominance in the genre left "power imbalances that acted as barriers to women's participation in Latin music."{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} Despite this barrier, women have become successful.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} Under the authority of men, they were limited to roles as [[vocalist]]s or dancers rather than [[instrumentalists]], writers, composers, [[music arranger|arrangers]], and executives.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} According to musicologist [[Ilan Stavans]], female roles were related to traditional norms; "decent women" cared for their children and remained at home, cleaning and cooking.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} Women's dance routines were a growing concern among female fans and performers.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} Female dancers, more closely scrutinized than males, were expected to follow "normative gender expectations" and exhibit "appropriate behavior".{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=268}} Although male dancers typically performed suggestively, women who danced similarly were accused of being "loose" or "slack".{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=268}}

[[File:Celia Cruz 1.jpg|thumb|alt=Black-and-white photo of Celia Cruz onstage in a fluffy gown|[[Celia Cruz]], who broke barriers against women in [[salsa music]], was instrumental in popularizing the genre.]]
According to author Lise Waxer, Cuban [[trova]] singer [[María Teresa Vera]] is the "great-grandmother of all Latin women singers".{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=147}} "Arroz Con Leche" ("Rice Pudding"), which advises the listener to find a spouse who will take care of them, was criticized by [[feminist]] groups.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=37}} [[Bolero]] lyrics have a central theme of women as the object of male desire, [[unrequited love]], and abandonment, portraying women as "physical absence and emotional distance, as ungrateful beings" unequipped to love a man.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} Cuban singer [[La Lupe]] "pushed the boundaries" of bolero music, and was called the queen of [[Latin soul]] music.{{sfn|Poey|2014}} She toured the U.S. with bandleader [[Tito Puente]], and was one of the most popular Latin performers of the 1960s.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} In her youth she dominated local singing competitions, which inspired her to pursue a career in music despite her parents' desire for her to become a teacher.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} After divorcing her first husband, La Lupe began a solo career and performed in [[Havana]] nightclubs.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} Her popularity grew, and she owned and operated a nightclub in Cuba which was seized by the [[Cuba under Fidel Castro|Castro government]].{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} La Lupe emigrated to the United States, settled in New York in 1962 and began touring the country with other bolero and salsa performers.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} She released several salsa albums with "devotional lyrics."{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} Her concert requests began diminishing at the turn of the 1970s as her savings drained because of her second husband's failing health.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} She ended her professional career in a wheelchair at a final, 1985 concert with Puente to help pay her medical expenses.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} La Lupe, who devoted her remaining years to [[Christian music]] in [[the Bronx]], died of [[cardiac arrest]] in February 1992.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} Cuban singers [[Rita Montaner]] and [[Celeste Mendoza]] were involved in the "appropriation and rearticulation of [[rhumba|rumba]]", a genre popular before salsa.{{sfn|Poey|2014}}
 
As [[salsa music]] grew in popularity, [[Celia Cruz]] emerged during the 1950s and was known as the queen of the genre.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=136}} Although Cruz was instrumental in popularizing and developing male-dominated salsa,{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} few other women are associated with it.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} She was the only female singer featured in the British documentary, ''Salsa: Latin Pop Music in the Cities'' (1985), which noted the absence of women in the industry.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} According to the documentary, women were "not trained in popular music and that women dared not improvise—''sonear'' (closeness)—on stage".{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} Cruz crossed boundaries set by public expectations for music performed at nightclubs, but she was the exception who proved the rule.{{sfn|Poey|2014}} Opportunities for all-female salsa bands were nonexistent; gender discrimination flourished in the market, and women were seen as "less competent than their male counterparts."{{sfn|Poey|2014}} In 1977 Cruz recorded "Usted Abusó", which gave a voice to [[violence against women|battered women]].{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=268}} The 1980s saw the emergence of [[salsa romántica]], which was "deemed as homogenized, depoliticized, and ultimately, feminized."{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}}
 
[[File:Gloriaestefan ahoy.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Gloria Estefan onstage, singing and holding flowers|In 1993, [[Gloria Estefan]] was the first musician to debut an album atop the ''Billboard'' [[Top Latin Albums]] chart.]]
During the 1990s women began playing a larger role in salsa music,{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=14}} increasing the genre's popularity,{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=136}} and female salsa singers broke "the sexist boundaries of the [Latin] music industry".{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=147}} Although women singers were becoming more popular, images of men were emphasized to the public more than those of women.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=14}} [[La India]], Corinne, [[Brenda K. Starr]], [[Lissette Melendez]], and Yolanda la Duke were instrumental in refining salsa in that decade, although all were managed by men.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=136}} Their new salsa sound was influenced by African American music ([[hip hop music|hip-hop]], [[contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[jazz music|jazz]], and [[soul music|soul]]), which revolutionized traditional 1970s salsa.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=136}} According to author Lise Waxer, a "careful and attentive listening" of their recordings indicated the "female authority and influence—a female genealogy—of salsa music."{{sfn|Waxer|2002|pp=136, 147}} Salsa's leading female singer was [[La India]],{{sfn|Candelaria|2004|p=412}} who developed salsa romantica music during the 1990s and whose lyrics "turn the tables" on the male salsa narrative of women as objects of desire, "cruel and evil or idealized and unattainable."{{sfn|Poey|2014}} In her most-popular song, "[[Ese Hombre (Rocío Jurado song)|Ese Hombre]]" (originally recorded by [[Rocío Jurado]]), La India contradicts male stereotypes.{{sfn|Poey|2014}} The song's lyrics describe a man who is "a fool/stupid and conceited/selfish and capricious", reversing male "discursive terrorism" toward their female partners.{{sfn|Poey|2014}} La India has been compared to Celia Cruz as leaders in their respective eras,{{sfn|Candelaria|2004|p=413}} and to La Lupe in musical style: "nasal style of singing, growls, and screams that evoke an androgynous style rather than a soft melodious tone."{{sfn|Poey|2014}}

In her Spanish-language debut, [[Gloria Estefan]] released ''[[Mi Tierra]]'' (1993). It was a commercial success, debuting atop the new US [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Top Latin Albums]] chart. Estefan has been described by her [[Latin pop]] contemporaries as performing [[pop ballad]]s and [[soft rock]].{{sfn|Aparicio|2010|p=113}} She has also ventured into salsa and [[merengue music]], using salsa in her English-language compositions; "[[Conga (song)|Conga]]" brought her to European clubs.{{sfn|Broughton|Ellingham|Trillo|1999|p=499}} The rural Cuban genre [[guajira (music)|guajira]] offered a musical identity to [[Afro-Cuban]]s;{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=305}} [[Albita Rodriguez]] became popular, and was named one of the top 100 personalities of the 20th century by ''[[Newsweek (magazine)|Newsweek]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Novas|2007|p=323}} Most of her repertoire are love songs with "openly erotic lyrics" with hetero- and homosexual themes.{{sfn|Aparicio|2010|p=243}}

The duo of [[Monchy y Alexandra]] "established [[bachata (music)|bachata]] as a [[easy listening|'nice']] music that could be listened to in the home by women and children."{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=91}} Women "embraced [the] clean-up"; the romantic bachata style, with emotive lyrics, expressed longing for a lost lover.{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=91}} In 1950s bachata music, women were accused of "treachery or promiscuity or, in more humorous moments, referring to [[women sexuality|their sexuality]] and sexual organs with thinly veiled double entendres."{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=89}} The lyrics were rooted in an era where [[women in the workplace]] became more common, displacing men as [[breadwinner]]s.{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=89}}

In 19th-century merengue music, a man "won the love of woman" by dancing.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=34}} Modern merengue (a [[club music|party]] genre) lyrics explored the "vicissitudes of urban life [and] employed skillful wordplay and humorous double entendres about women and sex."{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=88}} Because of the genre's "air of male-dominated sexuality", [[People of the Dominican Republic|Dominican]] men believed that making merengue music is "no fitting occupation for women."{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=116}} According to [[Santo Domingo|Santo Domingans]], listening to merengue music "is only for men" and a woman who enjoys the music is considered "a crazy girl [and] a bad girl."{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=116}} During the 1970s, attitudes toward women and merengue music changed with the changing roles of women in Dominican society.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=116}} All-female merengue bands emerged in the 1980s, beginning with [[Las Chicas Del Can]] in 1984.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=116}} Participation in merengue increased in 1990, with women playing [[percussion]] and [[brass]] instruments formerly considered too difficult for women.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=116}}

Female merengue bands were often formed by successful male merengue musicians, who "often referred to them as the property of the [male musicians who formed them]."{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=117}} The mainly-female merengue band [[Milly y los Vecinos|Milly, Jocelyn y Los Vecinos]] formed after Las Chicas del Can.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=117}} The group became popular, despite not setting out to challenge existing gender roles.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=117}} Feminists have noted the "limited values" in merengue recordings by women, since most of their songs are written by men who "do not resolutely challenge patriarchal attitudes."{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=118}} [[Olga Tañón]] was the most successful female merengue artist in the 1990s,{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=88}} and has been called the queen of merengue music.{{sfn|Steingress|2002|p=13}} Tañón has been credited with popularizing merengue in [[Music of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]], a salsa-dominated market.{{sfn|Morales|2003|p=248}} Her 1994 album, ''Siente el Amor'', outsold her previous recordings: ''[[Mujer de Fuego]]'' (1993) and her platinum-certified debut studio album, ''[[Sola]]'' (1992).{{sfn|Morales|2003|p=248}}

Since the [[history of radio|beginning of radio]] women have been accepted as [[mariachi]] singers, often performing duets with men.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=467}} The Mexican quintet Las Coronelas, formed by María Carlota Noriega during the 1940s, was the first mariachi [[all-female band]].{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=467}} The first all-female [[ranchera]] band, Las Generales (formed by Elena Muñoz), consisted of wives and mothers of male professional mariachi musicians.{{sfn|Greathouse|2009|p=112}} The group was criticized by the public for playing in ''[[cantina]]s'' ([[bar]]s),{{sfn|Greathouse|2009|p=112}} and their partners destroyed their instruments.{{sfn|Greathouse|2009|p=112}} Other all-female bands tried unsuccessfully to be pioneers.

At the turn of the decade, Tejano music was the fastest-growing music genre in the United States.{{sfn|Anon.|1996|p=10}} The American singer [[Selena]] dominated Tejano music, bringing it [[mainstream]] success.{{sfn|Lomelí|Ikas|2000|p=58}}{{sfn|Stavans|1998|p=5}} During her early career, she was often turned down by music venues because of her age and her fronting of [[Selena y Los Dinos|a Tejano band]].{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=112}} Selena's father, [[Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.]] was told that she would not be successful because she was a woman.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=112}} She was the first female Tejano singer to receive gold and platinum certifications,{{sfn|Roterman|1995}}{{sfn|Richmond|1995|p=48}} the first female Tejano singer to receive a [[Grammy Award for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album|Grammy Award for Best Mexican American Album]],{{sfn|Stacy|2002|p=746}} the first Tejano singer to top the US [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Top Latin Albums]] chart,{{sfn|Lannert|1994 (a)|p=34, 103}} and the first female to outsell male Tejano singers.{{sfn|Patoski|2000}}{{sfn|Acosta|2006}} After Selena's 1995 [[Murder of Selena|murder]], Tejano music waned in popularity.{{sfn|Paredez|2009|p=21}} Selena's popularity increased after her death, and she is the only Tejano singer with constant appearances on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=498}} Her posthumously-released album, ''[[Dreaming of You (Selena album)|Dreaming of You]]'' (1995), was the first recording by a Hispanic singer to debut atop the ''Billboard'' 200 chart.{{sfn|Marrero|2003|p=172}}{{sfn|Burr|2005|p=56}} Selena's music explored love, pain, strength and passion,{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=725}} and ''Billboard'' called her the best-selling Latin artist of the 1990s.{{sfn|Mayfield|1999|p=YE-16-18}} Latin music entered the mainstream market in the late 1990s, believed by music critics to be due to the death of Selena and the emergence of [[Ricky Martin]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Marc Anthony]],{{sfn|Márquez|2001}}{{sfn|Brill|2010}} with greater commercial success and worldwide recognition than ever before.{{sfn|Rivera-Servera|2012|p=10}}

In July 2017, Spanish writer Daniela Bose noted the absence of women in Spanish music charts in comparison with those of [[Music of France|France]] and [[Music of Italy|Italy]]; culturally similar to Spain, women were more successful in the latter countries.{{sfn|Bose|2017}} Bose analyzed the [[Spanish Albums Chart|Spanish Albums]] and [[Spanish Singles Chart|Singles Charts]], finding that the only Spanish singers who placed in the top 50 were [[Malú]], [[Vanesa Martin]], Sweet California, [[India Martinez]], and the [[Spanish folk music]] singers [[Mónica Naranjo]] and [[Isabel Pantoja]].{{sfn|Bose|2017}} When Bose expanded her search to the next 50 positions, she found only non-Spanish singers.{{sfn|Bose|2017}} She concluded that listeners had replaced Spanish and [[Latin pop]] music with reggaeton and [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap music]], genres performed by men with lyrics belittling women "as meat".{{sfn|Bose|2017}} Bose found a [[subtext]] in the songs encouraging female [[infidelity]] for sexual reasons, alluding to a non-committed relationship.{{sfn|Bose|2017}} According to Bose, music "is not one of those 'secure' professions [for those who] seek stability"; she found women absent from prominent positions held by men, such as heading a record label, producing concerts, and [[audio engineer]]ing; in these fields, with higher pay and power, women lack "decision-making process[es] that set the path for [the Latin music] industry."{{sfn|Bose|2017}} She ended her report by urging the music industry to avoid gender imbalances in their markets: "What dazzles is the beauty of the final work, regardless of who creates it."{{sfn|Bose|2017}}
