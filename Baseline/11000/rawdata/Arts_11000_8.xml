[[File:Roman remains in 39 Bridge Street, Chester (3).JPG|thumb|right|Part of the Roman remains in the cellar]]

'''39 Bridge Street''' is a building in [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England.  It is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;I [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]], its major archaeological feature being the remains of a [[Roman architecture|Roman]] [[hypocaust]] in its cellar.&lt;ref name=images&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376085|desc= 39&amp;nbsp;Bridge Street, Chester|accessdate= 6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building has four storeys, with a shop at street level and a portion of [[Chester Rows]] in the storey above.  The hypocaust in the cellar dates to the 2nd&amp;nbsp;century during the Roman occupation of Chester.  In the late 13th&amp;nbsp;or early 14th&amp;nbsp;century a [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval]] [[undercroft]] was built adjacent to the hypocaust, with a house above.  In 1864 a new floor was inserted at street level and a shop front was added in the 20th&amp;nbsp;century.  The ground floor is now used as a café.  The remains of the hypocaust were found during the reconstruction of the property in 1864.  They consist of 27&amp;nbsp;square columns in a rectangular chamber which originally contained 32&amp;nbsp;columns in eight rows of four.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

|work=Independent on Sunday|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20050220/ai_n9771257|date=20 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It draws from indigenous and world traditions using tenets of [[shamanism|shamanistic]], [[ecstatic dance|ecstatic]], mystical and [[eastern philosophy]].  It also draws from [[Gestalt therapy]], the human potential movement and [[transpersonal psychology]].
Fundamental to the practice is the idea that everything is energy, and moves in waves, [[Patterns in nature|patterns]] and rhythms.

Roth describes the practice as a soul journey, and says that by moving the body, releasing the heart, and freeing the mind, one can connect to the essence of the soul, the source of inspiration in which an individual has unlimited possibility and potential.

==The practice==
The practice of the 5Rhythms is said by [[Gabrielle Roth]] to put the body in motion in order to still the mind. The five rhythms (in order) are Flowing, Staccato, Chaos, Lyrical and Stillness.&lt;ref group=uspto&gt;USPTO Registration #'''&amp;nbsp;4840073''' European Union (https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/)  Registration #&amp;nbsp;'''014276281'''&lt;/ref&gt; The 5Rhythms, when danced in sequence, are known as a "Wave." A typical Wave takes about an hour to dance.&lt;ref&gt;Gabrielle Roth. ''Maps to Ecstasy'', 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Longer workshops may, according to ''The Dancing Path'', explore emotion, the cycle of life, the ego, relationships and spiritual vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gabrielleroth.com/ |work=5 rhythms global |title=The Dancing Path |accessdate=28 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912075641/http://www.gabrielleroth.com/ |archivedate=12 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 5Rhythms Maps==

The work is taught through a series of maps that explore the terrain of the inner and outer worlds of individuals, their relationships to others and the space around them. The maps offer a soul journey by exploring embodiment, emotions, the life cycle, the psyche, and the archetypes. The rhythms offer understanding of people's innate powers – being, loving, knowing, seeing and healing.&lt;ref name="Maps"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Maps of the 5Rhythms |url=https://www.5rhythms.com/gabrielle-roths-5rhythms/workshops/ |publisher=5Rhythms |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first map, "Waves" teaches embodiment of the five distinct rhythms. To embody the rhythms means to access the deep internal wisdom that human bodies contain. The "Heartbeat" map teaches how people have embodied and how they express the emotions of fear, anger, sadness, joy and compassion; while the "Cycles" map provides insight and understanding about how one has internalized conditioning and relationships throughout the life cycle, specifically in the stages of birth, childhood, puberty, maturity and death. Insight and understanding of the ego is delivered through the psyche map, "Mirrors".&lt;ref name="Maps"/&gt;

Roth drew a circular "Medicine Mandala" that related each rhythm to an emotion, a stage of life, a way of perceiving, and an aspect of the self.&lt;ref name="Mandala"&gt;{{cite web |title=Gabrielle Roth's 5Rhythms |url=https://www.5rhythms.com/gabrielle-roths-5rhythms/ |publisher=5Rhythms |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Charlotte Macleod, writing in the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' in 2009, describes dancing the 5Rhythms as a kind of antidote to life in a large city, and how she was attracted to a dance class by a video of Thom Yorke. The class leaves her "mentally and physically refreshed, and oddly connected to the other dancers." The dance was "a kind of moving meditation" for her.&lt;ref name="EveningStandard"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/thom-yorke-and-the-new-5rhythms-dance-craze-6389419.html | title=Thom Yorke and the new 5Rhythms dance craze | work=London Evening Standard |  date=April 6, 2011 | accessdate=March 17, 2012 | author=Macleod, Charlotte}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christine Ottery, writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2011, states that "ecstatic dancing has an image problem" and "encompasses everything from large global movements such as 5Rhythms and [[Biodanza]] to local drum'n'dance meet-ups". She suggests that readers may "find 5 Rhythms a good place to start", and does so herself: "Nervously, I stretch and warm my muscles. As the rhythms take off, I shake off my shyness." She dances in different ways, alone or with partners. "My body is expressing itself - it's utter abandonment and a complete high."&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jul/21/ecstatic-dance?INTCMP=SRCH | title=Ecstatic dance: rhythm to beat the blues | work=The Guardian | date=21 July 2009 | accessdate=March 18, 2012 | author=Ottery, Christine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jed Lipinski, writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2010, notes that 5Rhythms is suitable for all ages, unlike some other forms of dance and movement. He observes that "At a recent 5Rhythms class ... in Manhattan, more than 100 people were gleefully writhing and leaping to  tribal drumming  courtesy of Ms. Roth's husband, Robert Ansell... Dancers occasionally released  guttural howls, as if exorcising the demons of the workweek."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/fashion/05Sober.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | department= Fashion and Style | title=Dance, Dance, Dance. And That's It. | date=4 August 2010 | accessdate=9 June 2012 | author=Lipinski, Jed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' writes of 5Rhythms in 2007 that "I love it precisely because it isn't based on learned steps. Instead, the idea is to find your own dance by moving your body in whatever way you fancy. For those of us keen to improve our fitness, it can also be an energetic aerobic workout."&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/3346805/Feel-the-rhythm-from-head-to-heal.html | title=Feel the rhythm from head to heal | author=unattributed | publisher=Telegraph.co.uk | date=6 January 2007 | accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Academics working in mental health and other fields are starting to carry out research about the 5Rhythms. The [[Mental Health Foundation]], a UK charity published the 'Dancing for Living Report' describing a group of women's experience of 5Rhythms dance and the effects on their emotional wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Cook | first=Sarah  | last2=Ledger

==Parody in popular culture==
The British TV sitcom ''[[Peep Show (TV series)|Peep Show]]'' featured an episode ("Dance Class") where the two principal male characters attend a 'Rainbow Rhythms' class which invites its participants to interpretatively dance 'colours', featuring guidance and a closing circle reminiscent of a 5Rhythms class.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16410">'''Aesthetic judgement''', often also referred to as ‘taste’, is a concept in [[aesthetics]] which attempts to explain the nature of judgements of [[beauty]] and whether or not these judgements are legitimate.

The key idea for most traditional theories of taste was that objects possessed concrete properties that the perceiver ought to judge as beautiful or not. Failure to make the correct judgement was considered as something deficient within the beholder, whether that be a flaw within the person’s virtue or connected to a lack of knowledge that hinders their ability to perceive the beauty of the object. 

Aesthetic judgement as a concept rose to prominence in the eighteenth century, however its roots can be traced back many years to ancient Greek and medieval philosophers.

== Ancient conceptions of aesthetic judgement ==
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|The central image from Raphael's ''[[The School of Athens]]'' (1509-1511), depicting Plato (left) and Aristotle (right). Plato is depicted pointing upwards, in reference to his theory of forms, whilst Aristotle disagrees and points down towards reality, in reference to his belief in [[empiricism]].]]
[[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek philosophers]] did not possess an explicit concept of aesthetic judgement, however their ideas regarding aesthetics inspired later developments.  

=== Plato ===
[[Plato|Plato’s]] [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory held that there is an incorporeal realm in which the perfect [[Theory of forms|Forms]] of reality exist. This includes the perfect Form of Beauty, which one can rise up to through a [[Dialectic|dialectical]] method. Thus, in Plato’s terms, knowledge is critical to developing a better understanding of beauty and thus, a better capacity for aesthetic judgement.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/a-taste/|title=Aesthetic Taste|last=Spicher|first=Michael|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aristotle ===
[[Aristotle]] purported a more [[Experiential knowledge|experiential]] approach to aesthetic judgement, in that beauty was a property of objects being related to their size and proportion. To develop a capacity for aesthetic judgement, one has to observe enough objects of the same kind to uncover the correct form of those things. Both Aristotle and Plato perceived beauty as a property existing outside of human experience, with aesthetic judgement being the capacity to recognise that beauty, developed by the search for beauty in things.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Medieval conceptions of aesthetic judgement ==
Although Medieval philosophers did not possess a particular notion of individual preference or taste, they were particularly preoccupied with a [[Cosmology|cosmological]] interpretation of beauty, with relation to specific [[Ontology|ontological]] properties. This is attributed to the fact that philosophers of the medieval age had an object notion of beauty, and also because it was a common belief that morality was linked with beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marinescu|first=Axia|date=2014-01-01|title=Beauty and Judgement in German Aesthetics|url=https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/hssr/3/1/article-p124.xml|journal=Human &amp; Social Studies. Research and Practice|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|doi=10.2478/hssr-2013-0024|issn=2285-5920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Augustine of Hippo ===
Expanding upon Plato’s Theory of the Forms, [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] believed that perfect beauty existed within God. Augustine proposed equality and unity as the two properties that made physical objects beautiful. Aesthetic judgement is thus the ability of an individual to recognise the unity and equality of an object, thus involving an exercise of reason and knowledge, similar to the theories of previous thinkers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since the ultimate state of beauty exists in God’s mind, an observer can only recognise this through [[divine illumination]]. Thus, one’s capacity for aesthetic judgement is improved the closer one is to God.

=== Thomas Aquinas ===
[[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] also presented properties that make an object beautiful: proportion, wholeness and radiance. Thus, similar to his philosophical predecessors, he constituted the judgement of beauty to be dependent on knowledge and occurring through the function of cognition. Possessing a capacity for aesthetic judgement is therefore determined by one’s ability to recognise these properties in observed objects. Aquinas does however diverge from previous philosophers on certain notions. His definition of that beauty as "that which, when seen, pleases" can be interpreted as an implication of the subjectivity of beauty and thus judgements about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wood|first=Robert E.|date=2015-06-23|title=Review of Aquinas on Beauty|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/aquinas-on-beauty/|issn=1538-1617}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he rejects Plato’s Theory of Forms, stating that beauty is a real quality present within objects. Ultimately however he converges upon Augustine’s view that God is the source of all beauty.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== 18th century theories of aesthetic judgement ==
Explicit theories of aesthetic judgement emerged and predominated in the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, being referred to as “the century of taste”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/435824318|title=The century of taste : the philosophical odyssey of taste in the eighteenth century|last=1926-|first=Dickie, George,|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195357134|location=New York|oclc=435824318}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Philosophers developed a more introspective stance to attempt to understand their personal dispositions to beauty.

=== Anthony Cooper, the Third Earl of Shaftesbury ===
[[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Cooper]] (1671-1713), the Third Earl of Shaftesbury, purported his philosophical ideas through his [[Socratic dialogue]] “The Moralists, a Philosophical Rhapsody”, which stands in almost direct contrast to the theories and assumptions posited by Addison.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Shelley|first=James|title=18th Century British Aesthetics|date=2018|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/aesthetics-18th-british/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaftesbury claimed that taste was a quality innate within human beings. One’s capacity to observe and make correct judgements of beauty was dependent on one’s moral righteousness. The key property Shaftesbury ascribed to beautiful objects is harmony, the prime source of which is nature, which in turn is formed by God who is constituted as the ultimate source of beauty.

=== Joseph Addison ===
[[Joseph Addison]] (1672-1719) posited theories that were in almost direct contrast to those of Shaftesbury. Central to Addison’s theory of aesthetic judgement is the concept that pleasures of taste are essentially “pleasures of the imagination”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Addison’s fundamental divergence from Shaftesbury is that he views taste to be a judgement of visual representation as exercised by the imagination, rather than as an exercise of the intellect and of moral righteousness. Addison constituted two types of pleasures of the imagination: primary pleasures, as in those derived from visual images directly observed by an individual of an object in front of them and secondary pleasures, which arise from images of objects that are absent from sight and therefore exist only in the mind. Addison’s materialist basis predisposes his theory to subjectivism and relativism, leading Addison to declare that there “is not perhaps any real beauty”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Alexander Gerard ===
[[Alexander Gerard]] (1728-1795) considered taste in a similar fashion to the six external [[Sense|senses]], in that experiences of aesthetic judgement are also simple and instantaneous. He also developed his views from the philosophical framework of [[associationism]]. Aesthetic judgements are exercises of the faculty of imagination, in which a newly observed object is associated to previous ideas in the mind of the observer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Gerard determines that taste is improved when a person exercises their capacities for judgment and taste to recognise the four core elements of sensibility, refinement, correctness and proportion within objects.

== David Hume's theory of taste ==
David Hume’s theories on aesthetic judgement were purported in his 1757 essay ''[[Four Dissertations|Of the Standard of Taste]]''. Hume ascribed some normative quality to aesthetic judgements whilst providing critiques of the more relativist positions on the matter. Whilst acknowledging that judgements cannot reasonably be determined to be objectively true or false, he championed the notion of “common sense”, which held that some evaluations are better than others.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mnstate.edu/gracyk/courses/phil%20of%20art/hume_and_kant.htm|title=Aesthetic theories of David Hume and Immanuel Kant|website=web.mnstate.edu|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hume also reinforced the conception of aesthetic judgements as an exercise of the faculty of the imagination, determining beauty to not be a property of objects but existing only in the mind, and the ones that are deemed more beautiful are the ones that affect the higher sentiments, or high cognitive or intellectual capacities of the observer. Hume also sought to establish a universal standard of aesthetic judgement, seeking a basis upon which we can “confirm” one sentiment and “condemn” another.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In doing this he refers to [[Classic book|classic texts]] which seemingly have received universal acclaim beyond through different times and cultures. Hume asserts that such universal acclamation identifies a work of real genius, and such works should be examined to provide us with guidelines for the composition of good art. Hume provides characteristics of what he refers to as a true judge in matters of aesthetics:
[[File:Painting of David Hume.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of David Hume'' ''(1711-1776)'']]
{{Quote|text="Strong sense, united to delicate sentiment, improved by practice, perfected by comparison, and cleared of all prejudice”|sign=David Hume|source="Four Dissertations", Of the Standard of Taste}}The consensus of these critics constitutes what Hume called a “joint verdict”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/aesthetic-judgment|title=Aesthetic Judgment {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which composes the "true standard"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; for aesthetic judgements. This standard is constituted as universally correct, and failure to recognise pleasure in the object is considered a defect within the observer.

Hume does concede however that certain subjectivities affecting aesthetic judgements cannot be eliminated. He indicates two circumstances that will create irrevocable prejudices. First he refers to natural, generational and cultural dispositions which are fundamental and relative to individuals. The second is determined by the critics’ degree of moral righteousness. Ascribing a normative characteristic to morality, Hume declares that aesthetic merit is influenced by “the natural boundaries of vice and virtue”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, and if the artist does not conform to these moral regulations then they and their art will inevitably divert from Hume’s true standard.

== Immanuel Kant's "judgement of taste" ==
Central to the concept of aesthetic judgement is Kant’s notion of the “judgement of taste”, introduced in his seminal 1790 book the ''[[Critique of Judgment|Critique of Judgement]].'' In the text, Kant determined two essential conditions for a judgement to be classified as a judgement of taste – subjectivity and universality. 

Subjectivity refers to the fact that a judgement of taste is based on a feeling of pleasure or displeasure. The second necessary condition of a judgement of taste is that it claims “universal validity”, which Kant describes as follows:

{{Quote|text=“… when [a man] puts a thing on a pedestal and calls it beautiful, he demands the same delight from others. He judges not merely from himself, but for all men, and then speaks of beauty as if it were a property of things”|sign=Immanuel Kant|source=Critique of Judgement}}
Kant emphasises the fact that requiring the agreement of others is an inextricable characteristic of aesthetic judgements. We think that others “ought” to share our judgement, and we blame them if they don’t, as if there was a deficiency within them to recognise beauty and make judgements upon it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Zangwill|first=Nick|title=Aesthetic Judgment|date=2014|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/aesthetic-judgment/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2014|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetic judgements, unique from other types of judgements that Kant lists, therefore make a claim to universal validity. Kant also states that pleasure in beauty is disinterested in that it is desire-free. Whilst agreeing that pleasure in beauty can generate desire, he states that it is an essential characteristic of aesthetic judgements that they are found to be pleasurable because they are judged to be beautiful, rather than being judged as beautiful because they are found to be pleasurable.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/kantaest/#SH2a|title=Immanuel Kant: Aesthetics|last=Burnham|first=Douglas|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant provides a “deep” account of the nature of pleasure in beauty, which states that it accomplished through the simultaneous exercise of the cognitive faculties of imagination and understanding.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This is the premise upon which Kant asserts his normative claim on aesthetic judgements. Because these judgements are a function of cognitive faculties, which Kant assumed can be shared by humans, it must be possible for them to be shared.
Kant also purported that pleasure in beauty can be attributed to our recognition that the qualities of an object conform to basic functions of human cognition. We maintain a presupposition that all objects seemed to be formed in a way that enables them to be analysed by human observers. Beauty is the quality of an object assuming a “form of purposiveness”, despite the absence of an identification of a specific purpose.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When we respond to an object’s appearance without any comprehension of utility, we respond in an aesthetic manner. The feeling of pleasure is a signal that the object is able to be comprehended through exercising the human faculty of understanding. An aesthetic judgement is therefore a judgement about human cognition rather than a material object.

== Nineteenth and twentieth century theories of aesthetic judgement ==
Philosophical concerns with aesthetic judgement declined rapidly after the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, with the majority of discourse shifting to the concept of an aesthetic attitude.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite this, there have been philosophers who have persisted with the concept of aesthetic taste, which has resulted in some notable contributions in contemporary times. 

=== Frank Sibley ===
[[Frank Sibley (philosopher)|Frank Sibley]] (1929-1996) defined aesthetic judgements to be evaluations that apply aesthetic concepts to objects through aesthetic terminology. Taste is thus an individual’s capacity to recognise these properties and employ aesthetic concepts and terms appropriately to describe them.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Sibley also asserts that aesthetic judgements are objective and that beauty is an objective property present within objects, departing from the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century philosophical norm of subjectivist interpretation.

'''''Ali: Fear Eats the Soul''''' ({{lang-de|'''Angst essen Seele auf'''|lit=Fear Eat Soul Up}}) is a 1974 [[West German film]] written and directed by [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]], starring [[Brigitte Mira]] and [[El Hedi ben Salem]]. The film won the [[International Federation of Film Critics]] award for best in-competition movie and the [[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]] at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2216/year/1974.html |title=Festival de Cannes: ''Ali: Fear Eats the Soul'' |accessdate=2009-04-26|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be one of Fassbinder's most powerful works and is hailed by many as a masterpiece.

The film revolves around the romance that develops between Emmi, an elderly German woman and Ali, a Moroccan migrant worker in post-[[World War II]] [[Germany]].

==Plot==
The film takes place an unspecified number of months after the [[Munich Massacre]] in [[West Germany]]. Emmi (Mira), a 60 year-old window cleaner and widow, enters a bar, driven in by the rain and wanting to listen to the music being played inside. A woman in the bar (Katharina Herberg) tauntingly suggests Ali (Salem), a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] ''[[Gastarbeiter]]'' ([[guest worker]]) in his late thirties, ask Emmi to dance, to which Emmi accepts. After they dance, they develop a friendship and Ali follows Emmi home, staying at her apartment for the night. After some more interaction between the two, they start to fall in love and Ali continues to live with Emmi. Emmi decides to visit her children to introduce them to Ali; daughter Krista ([[Irm Hermann]]) and her tyrannical son-in-law Eugen (Fassbinder himself); Eugen thinks she is losing her sanity and Krista thinks that her mother - who has been a widow for years - is fantasizing.

Their relationship is threatened when the landlord's son, who has been sent on the assumption that Emmi has taken in a lodger,  to point out to Emmi that subletting is against Emmi's tenancy agreement, and that Ali must leave within a day. Fearful of losing Ali, Emmi claims that she and Ali are planning to marry to alleviate this problem. After the landlord's son apologizes for the misapprehension and leaves, Emmi speaks to Ali and apologizes for having invented the idea of her marrying him, but is surprised by Ali when he says that it is an excellent idea. The film then shows them in a civil court, married.

Their marriage is looked upon negatively by those who live near them, which include apartment tenants and nearby shop keepers. Emmi is shunned by her coworkers, and Ali faces discrimination at every turn. When Emmi invites her three grown children and son-in-law to meet Ali, they openly reject him. One of Emmi's sons smashes in her TV set in anger, her other son declares she must have lost her sanity, and her daughter calls her apartment a "pigsty" and calls Emmi a "whore", before the four of them leave.

Emmi's sadness towards this rejection washes away as her optimism resurfaces and decides that she and Ali should take a long vacation together to escape the discrimination, convinced that upon return, they will have been missed and will be welcomed back. After their return, they face less discrimination, but only because neighboring tenants and shopkeepers see the gain in treating Emmi better, not because they have outgrown their prejudices.

Wanting to get back with her old friends' after their apparent renewed respect, Emmi begins to neglect Ali or to adopt some of their attitudes toward him.  She becomes more strict, ordering him to do more things. When co-workers visit and remark on how surprisingly clean he is and comment on his muscles, she shows him off as if he were an object.  This causes Ali to leave, and to seek comfort in female bartender Barbara (Barbara Valentin), with whom he has apparently had a relationship with prior to meeting Emmi.  When he leaves Emmi to her friends, she attributes it to his "mood swings," and notes that it must be his "foreigner mentality", adopting the xenophobic attitudes of her friends in order to fit in. This causes them to drift apart, with Ali not standing up to Emmi because of the insecurities he faces as a foreigner. He then turns back to the bartender,  spending the night with her. Emmi wants to see him more visits him at work, where he pretends he doesn't know her as his workmates make fun of her age, calling her Ali's "Moroccan grandmother."

Just when it seems as if the relationship is beyond repair, Emmi goes back to the bar where they first met to meet with Ali and has the bartender put the same song on the jukebox that led to their dance in the beginning of the movie. They decide to dance together, and, while dancing, Emmi emphasizes that she knows she is old and that he is free to come and go, but tells him that when they are together, they must be nice to each other. He agrees and they declare their love for each other. In that moment, Ali collapses in Emmi's arms from what turns out to be a burst [[stomach ulcer]]. The film then shows Emmi with Ali in the hospital, where a doctor tells her the illness is common among foreign workers because of the stress they face in everyday life; the doctor then adds that Ali will have surgery to remove the ulcer, but that he will probably be back in six months with another ulcer. Emmi declares that she will do everything in her power to prevent this and holds Ali's hand.

==Production==
The film was shot in just under two weeks, and was planned as an exercise in film-making for Fassbinder, to fill in the time in his schedule between the work on two other films, ''[[Martha (1974 film)|Martha]]'' and ''[[Effi Briest (1974 film)|Effi Briest]]''.{{ref|1}}

Ali is played by [[El Hedi ben Salem]], who was Fassbinder's [[significant other|partner]] at the time. Fassbinder himself has a cameo appearance as Emmi's son in law. Emmi's daughter, Kristin, played by [[Irm Hermann]]), had herself a turbulent relationship with Fassbinder in real life, having been quoted as saying of Fassbinder, "He couldn't conceive of my refusing him, and he tried everything. He almost beat me to death on the streets of [[Bochum]] ....".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Baer|1986|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; And Fassbinder himself grew up under some of the domestic effects of immigrant prejudice, given that his mother immigrated back to Germany from Poland after the Soviet Occupation and Fassbinder grew up in a turbulent and eventually divorcing household where immigrating relatives stayed with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Watson|1992|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original German title ''Angst essen Seele auf'' is deliberately grammatically incorrect, translating literally as "Fear eat soul up."  The correct German form would be ''"Angst isst die Seele auf''" - which (without the definite article "die") became the title of a related 2002 short film also starring Mira. The title is one of the things Ali tells Emmi. As an immigrant, he speaks in what can be referred to as  "[[Broken English|broken German]]" consistently throughout the film. The line of dialogue he utters is simply "Fear eat soul up." Since Ali's poor German grammar is translated literally in the film's English subtitles, the subtitles for Ali's dialogue are similarly riddled with grammatical errors.

''Ali'' is in part an homage to the films of [[Douglas Sirk]], in particular ''[[Imitation of Life (1959 film)|Imitation of Life]]'' (1959) and ''[[All That Heaven Allows]]'' (1955). The most overt homage is the scene in which Emmi's son kicks in the television (an important symbol in ''All That Heaven Allows'') after finding out that his mother has married a [[north African]].&lt;ref name=Toteberg&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1068-ali-fear-eats-the-soul-all-that-fassbinder-allows |title=Ali: Fear Eats the Soul: All That Fassbinder Allows |first=Michael |last=Töteberg |date=1990 }} Posting of a published essay by Fassbinder's biographer and editor.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes and symbolism==
"Fear eats the soul", which is one of the things Ali says while talking with Emmi early in the movie, becomes almost literal later on, when it turns out that Ali has a stomach ulcer and is hospitalized. The characters are also often shown on screen in exaggerated ways; Characters are shown far away from the camera to emphasize how distant from society Emmi and Ali feel, while their apartment is shot in a claustrophobic manner, to symbolize the fear they feel in their relationship and everyday life.&lt;ref name="Ebert Digital LLC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=Great Movie: Ali: Fear Eats the Soul|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-ali-fear-eats-the-soul-1974|website=rogerebert.com|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Upon release===
The film gained critical acclaim upon its release, with the film's tone and Fassbinder's direction being signaled out as highlights. Writing for ''The [[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, saying: "[Fassbinder] nudges us to get outside the movie and look at it as absurd, as black humor, as [a] comment on these people so hopelessly trapped in their dreary surroundings and by their fates...Is [Fassbinder] sometimes being deliberately funny? I’m sure of it. His style and tone are so adamant that audiences sometimes just sit in silence, uncertain of the right response. With some films, that indicates the director’s loss of control over tone. With Fassbinder, it seems to be the response he wants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=Ali: Fear eats the soul review|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/ali-fear-eats-the-soul-1974|website=rogerebert.com|publisher=Ebert digital LLC|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gene Moskowitz of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave it a similarly positive review, calling the film "Not showy for exploitation, too observant and cool for robust hyoping".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moskowitz|first1=Gene|title=Fear eats the soul out review|url=https://cinefiles.bampfa.berkeley.edu/cinefiles/DocDetail?docId=2983|website=cinefiles; the review came from Variety magazine|publisher=Variety Media, LLC|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent Canby of ''[[The New York Times]]'' dissented somewhat, calling it a "Courageous attempt" and praising Mira and Salem's performances, while criticizing the "Posterlike Blandness" of the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Canby|first1=Vincent|title=At the Film Festival: ‘Ali’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/07/archives/at-the-film-festivalali-fassbinder-explore-racial-prejudice-the.html|website=nytimes.com|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the acclaim his movie received, Fassbinder stated that he thought it was only the 8th best movie he made.&lt;ref name="NYTretrospec"/&gt;

===Modern reception===
The film has continued to receive positive reviews, with Mira and Salem's acting being praised as a highlight. On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 100%, based on 32 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 9.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Regarded as one of the high-water marks in German New Wave cinema of the 1970s, Ali: Fear Eats the Soul is at once an intense portrayal of a relationship and a tribute to one of Rainer Werner Fassbinder's film heroes, Douglas Sirk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ANGST ESSEN SEELE AUF (ALI: FEAR EATS THE SOUL)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fear_of_fear/|website=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Fandago|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Alex Abramovich calls ''Ali'' "The most thought-provoking, and beautiful, of [Fassbinder's] films"&lt;ref name=NYTretrospec/&gt; Richard Brody of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' praised the direction, saying "Fassbinder uses the camera with a precise, novelistic touch", and also praised Fassbinder's tributes to other films, saying "...[Fassbinder] didn't just make use of prior forms, he quoted them, and derived from them the ironies implicit in his melodramatic styles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brody|first1=Richard|title=DVD of the week: Ali: Fear eats the Soul|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/dvd-of-the-week-ali-fear-eats-the-soul|website=newyorker.com|publisher=Condé Nast|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Peter Bradshaw calls Mira and Salem's performance "Superb", and "The most purely lovable characters I have ever seen on a movie screen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bradshaw|first1=Peter|title=Fear Eats the Soul review – love versus racism in Fassbinder's exquisite tale|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/30/fear-eats-the-soul-review-love-versus-racism-in-fassbinders-exquisite-tale|website=thegaurdian.com|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Re-reviewing the movie for his ''[[Great Movies]]'' series of essays, [[Roger Ebert]] calls the film "Very powerful" and ends his review by saying, "“Ali: Fear Eats the Soul” might sound like improbable, contrived soap opera. It doesn’t play that way." &lt;ref name="Ebert Digital LLC"/&gt;

The term '''American folk music''' encompasses numerous music genres, variously known as ''traditional music'', ''traditional [[folk music]]'', ''contemporary folk music'', or ''roots music''. Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and sometimes trace back to such origins as Great Britain, Europe, or Africa.&lt;ref name=afc&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/folklife/guide/folkmusicandsong.html "Folk Music and Song", American Folklife Center, Library of Congress]&lt;/ref&gt; Musician [[Mike Seeger]] once famously commented that the definition of American folk music is "...all the music that fits between the cracks."&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.youranswerplace.org/(riylqzaouv3t2j55dvrnwt21)/NewCopyListing.aspx?QS0=&amp;QS1=2&amp;QS2=Folk%20music%20United%20States&amp;QS3=1&amp;QS4=2&amp;QS5=0&amp;QS6=99&amp;QS7=0&amp;QS8=9999&amp;QS9=0&amp;QS10=99&amp;QS11=263042&amp;QS12=1&amp;QS13=1&amp;QS14=457430&amp;QS15=9780399530333 catalog.youranswerplace.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Roots music is a broad category of music including [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[old time music]], [[jug band]]s, [[Appalachian folk music|Appalachian folk]], [[blues]], [[Cajun music|Cajun]] and [[Native American music]].  The music is considered American either because it is native to the United States or because it developed there, out of foreign origins, to such a degree that it struck [[musicologist]]s as something distinctly new. It is considered "roots music" because it served as the basis of [[music of the United States|music later developed in the United States]], including [[rock and roll]], [[rhythm and blues]], and [[jazz]].

==Early American folk music==
Most songs of the Colonial Fletch and Revolutionary period originated in England, Scotland and Ireland and were brought over by early settlers. "[[Barbara Allen (song)|Barbara Allen"]] remains a popular [[ballad|traditional ballad]] originating in England and Scotland, which immigrants introduced to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Raph, Theodore. ''The American Song Treasury'', Dover Publications (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[murder ballad]] "[[Pretty Polly (ballad)|Pretty Polly]]" is an American version of an earlier British song, "The Gosport Tragedy".&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/americanrootsmusic/pbs_arm_es_folkballad.html "Folk Songs and Ballads", American Roots Music, PBS]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spirituals===
{{Main|Spiritual (music)}}
African American folk music in the area has roots in slavery and emancipation.  "Sacred music, both a Capella and instrumentally accompanied, is at the heart of the tradition. Early spirituals framed Christian beliefs within native practices and were heavily influenced by the music and rhythms of Africa."&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk/&gt;  Spirituals are prominent, and often use a call and response pattern.&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk/&gt; "Gospel developed after the Civil War (1861-65). It relied on biblical text for much of its direction, and the use of metaphors and imagery was common. Gospel is a "joyful noise," sometimes accompanied by instrumentation and almost always punctuated by hand clapping, toe tapping, and body movement."&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk/&gt;

===Work songs===

====Sea shanties====
{{Main|Sea shanty}}
Sea shanties functioned to lighten the burden of routine tasks and provide a rhythm that helped workers perform as a team.&lt;ref name=afc/&gt;

====Cowboy songs====
Cowboys songs are typically ballads that [[cowboy|cowboys]] sang in the West and Southwest. The familiar [[Streets of Laredo (song)|Streets of Laredo]]" (or "Cowboys Lament") derives from an Irish folk song of the late 18th century called "[[The Unfortunate Rake]]",&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; which in turn appears to have descended from the even earlier "[[The Bard of Armagh]]". While "Streets of Laredo" uses the same melody as "The Unfortunate Rake", "[[St. James Infirmary Blues]]" adapts the story to a different tune. This illustrates how folk songs can change in the retelling and appear in a variety of versions.&lt;ref name=afc/&gt;

====Railroad songs====
The "Ballad of [[John Henry (folklore)]]" is about an African-American folk hero said to have worked as a "steel-driving man".&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;

==Roots music==
Many roots musicians do not consider themselves folk musicians. The main difference between the [[American folk music revival]] and American "roots music" is that roots music seems to cover a broader range, including blues and country.

Roots music developed its most expressive and varied forms in the first three decades of the 20th century.  The [[Great Depression]] and the [[Dust Bowl]] were extremely important in disseminating these musical styles to the rest of the country, as [[Delta blues]] masters, itinerant [[honky tonk]] singers, [[Cajun]] musicians spread to cities like [[Chicago]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], and [[New York City|New York]].  The growth of the [[record industry|recording industry]] in the same period was also important; higher potential profits from music placed pressure on artists, songwriters, and label executives to replicate previous hit songs.  This meant that musical fads, such as [[Hawaii]]an [[slack-key guitar]], never died out completely, since a broad range of rhythms, instruments, and vocal stylings were incorporated into disparate popular genres.

By the 1950s, forms of roots music had led to pop-oriented forms.  Folk musicians like the [[Kingston Trio]], blues-derived [[rock and roll]] and [[rockabilly]], pop-gospel, [[doo wop]] and [[R&amp;B]] (later secularized further as [[soul music]]) and the [[Nashville sound]] in country music all modernized and expanded the musical palette of the country.

The roots approach to music emphasizes the diversity of American musical traditions, the genealogy of creative lineages and communities, and the innovative contributions of musicians working in these traditions today.  In recent years roots music has been the focus of popular media programs such as [[Garrison Keillor]]'s public radio program, ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' and the feature film by the same name.

==Regional forms==
American traditional music is also called roots music.  Roots music is a broad category of music including [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[country music]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[old time music]], [[jug band]]s, [[Appalachian folk music|Appalachian folk]], [[blues]], [[Cajun music|Cajun]] and [[Native American music]].  The music is considered American either because it is native to the United States or because it developed there, out of foreign origins, to such a degree that it struck [[musicologist]]s as something distinctly new. It is considered "roots music" because it served as the basis of music later developed in the United States, including [[rock and roll]], contemporary folk music, [[rhythm and blues]], and [[jazz]].

===Appalachian music===
{{See also|Music of East Tennessee}}
[[Appalachian music]] is the traditional music of the region of [[Appalachia]] in the Eastern United States. It derives from various European and African influences—including English [[ballad]]s, Irish and Scottish traditional music (especially [[fiddle]] music), hymns, and African-American blues.  First recorded in the 1920s, Appalachian musicians were a key influence on the early development of [[Old-time music]], [[country music]], and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and were an important part of the [[American folk music revival]].

Instruments typically used to perform Appalachian music include the [[banjo]], [[American fiddle]], [[Appalachian dulcimer|fretted dulcimer]], and [[guitar]].&lt;ref name=olson&gt;Ted Olson, "Music&amp;nbsp;— Introduction".  ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1109—1120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early recorded Appalachian musicians include [[Fiddlin' John Carson]], [[Henry Whitter]], [[Bascom Lamar Lunsford]], the [[Carter Family]], [[Clarence Ashley]], [[Frank Proffitt]], and [[Dock Boggs]], all of whom were initially recorded in the 1920s and 1930s. Several Appalachian musicians obtained renown during the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s, including [[Jean Ritchie]], [[Roscoe Holcomb]], [[Ola Belle Reed]], [[Lily May Ledford]], and [[Doc Watson]].

The Carter Family was a traditional American folk music group that recorded between 1927 and 1956. Their music had a profound impact on [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[country music|country]], [[Southern Gospel]], [[popular music|pop]] and [[rock music]]ians. They were the first vocal group to become country music stars; a beginning of the divergence of country music from traditional folk music. Their recordings of such songs as "[[Wabash Cannonball]]" (1932), "[[Can the Circle Be Unbroken (By and By)|Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]" (1935), "[[Wildwood Flower]]" (1928), and "[[Keep on the Sunny Side]]" (1928) made them country standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Definitive Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rock |last=Heatley |first=Michael |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=Star Fire |location=London, United Kingdom |isbn=978-1-84451-996-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Country and bluegrass artists such as [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Roy Acuff]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Chet Atkins]], and [[Don Reno]] were heavily influenced by traditional Appalachian music.&lt;ref name=olson /&gt;  Artists such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Jerry Garcia]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]] have performed Appalachian songs or rewritten versions of Appalachian songs.

===Cajun music===
[[Cajun music]], an emblematic [[music of Louisiana]], is rooted in the [[ballads]] of the French-speaking [[Acadian]]s of [[Canada]]. Cajun music is often mentioned in tandem with the [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]]-based, [[Cajun]]-influenced [[zydeco]] form, both of [[Acadiana]] origin. These [[French Louisiana#Modern French Louisiana|French Louisiana]] sounds have influenced [[American popular music]] for many decades, especially country music, and have influenced pop culture through mass media, such as television commercials.

===Oklahoma and southern US plains===
[[File:Woody Guthrie NYWTS.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Singer-songwriter [[Woody Guthrie]] emerged from the dust bowl of Oklahoma and the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] in the mid-20th Century, with lyrics that embraced his views on ecology, poverty, and [[Trade union|unionization in the USA.]], paired with melody reflecting the many genres of American folk music.]]
Before recorded history American Indians in this area used songs and instrumentation; music and dance remain the core of ceremonial and social activities.&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk/&gt;  "Stomp dance" remains at its core, a "call and response" form; instrumentation is provided by rattles or shackles worn on the legs of women.&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk&gt;[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/F/FO010.html Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture - Folk Music]&lt;/ref&gt;  "Other southeastern nations have their own complexes of sacred and social songs, including those for animal dances and friendship dances, and songs that accompany stickball games.

Central to the music of the southern Plains Indians is the drum, which has been called the heartbeat of Plains Indian music. Most of that genre traces back to the hunting and warfare that was a strong part of plains culture.&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk/&gt;  During the reservation period, they frequently used music to relieve boredom and despair. Neighbors gathered, exchanged and created songs and dances. This is a part of the roots of the modern intertribal [[powwow]]. Another common instrument is the courting flute.&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk/&gt;

[[Shape-note]] or [[sacred harp]] singing developed in the early nineteenth century as a way for itinerant singing instructors to teach church songs in rural communities. They taught using song books that represented musical notation of tones by geometric shapes that associated a shape with a pitch. Sacred harp singing became popular in many Oklahoma rural communities, regardless of ethnicity.&lt;ref name=OklahomaFolk/&gt;

Later, the blues tradition developed, with roots in and parallels to sacred music.&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk/&gt;   By the early 20th century, jazz developed, born from a "blend of ragtime, gospel, and blues"&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk/&gt; "Anglo-Scots-Irish music traditions gained a place in Oklahoma after the Land Run of 1889. Because of its size and portability, the fiddle was the core of early Oklahoma Anglo music, but other instruments such as the guitar, mandolin, banjo, and steel guitar were added later. Various Oklahoma music traditions trace their roots to the British Isles, including cowboy ballads, western swing, and contemporary country and western."&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk/&gt; "Mexican immigrants began to reach Oklahoma in the 1870s, bringing beautiful canciones and corridos love songs, waltzes, and ballads along with them. Like American Indian communities, each rite of passage in Hispanic communities is accompanied by traditional music.

The acoustic guitar, string bass, and violin provide the basic instrumentation for Mexican music, with maracas, flute, horns, or sometimes accordion filling out the sound."&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk/&gt;  Other Europeans (such as Bohemians and Germans) settled in the late nineteenth century. Their social activities centered on community halls, "where local musicians played polkas and waltzes on the accordion, piano, and brass instruments."&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk/&gt;

Later Asians contributed to the musical mix.  "Ancient music and dance traditions from the temples and courts of China, India, and Indonesia are preserved in Asian communities throughout the state, and popular song genres are continually layered on to these classical music forms"&lt;ref name = OklahomaFolk/&gt;

===The American Southwest and South Texas===
[[Tejano music|Tejano]] and [[New Mexico music]], heard throughout the [[American Southwest]] and [[South Texas]], is rooted in the musics of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic/Latino]] communities of the regions. Tejano music is also heavily influenced by [[Regional Mexican music|Regional Mexican]] and Country music, while New Mexico music is much more influenced by [[Hispanos of New Mexico|Hispano]] folk and [[Western music (North America)|Western music]]. Both styles have influenced one another over the years, and incorporated American popular music styles.

==Other American folk music==
Genres here range as widely as the definition of folk music itself; working definitions are based on the style and themes of the music regardless of its source.  Many are a part of the [[American Folk Music Revival]], including works by [[Pete Seeger]], [[Woody Guthrie]], [[The Weavers]],{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 18}} [[Burl Ives]], and others.  A more commercially oriented pop music version of folk emerged in the 1960s, including performers such as [[The Kingston Trio]],{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 18}} [[The Limeliters]], [[The Brothers Four]], [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], [[Joan Baez]],{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 19}} [[The Highwaymen (folk band)|The Highwaymen]], [[Judy Collins]], [[The New Christy Minstrels]], and [[Gordon Lightfoot]], as well as counterculture and folk rock performers including [[Bob Dylan]],{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=shows 31-32}} [[The Byrds]], [[Arlo Guthrie]], and [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]].{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 33}} Folk composer and musician [[Robert Schmertz (artist)|Robert Schmertz]] composed and wrote [[List of songs by Robert Schmertz|pieces]] related to historical events in Western Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Journal_obituary"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://journals.psu.edu/wph/article/viewFile/3386/3217|title=Historical Society Notes and Documents: Robert Watson Schmertz|last=Swetnam|first=George|volume=54|number=4|journal=The Western Pennsylvania Historical Magazine|year=October 1975|pages=537–538}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Covers,_Bio"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3528108/composer_architect_entertains_avon_club/|title=Composer, Architect Entertains Avon Club|newspaper=News Record|date=October 27–28, 1973|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
In 2004, [[NPR]] published the book titled ''The NPR Curious Listener's Guide to American Folk Music'',&lt;ref name="foreword"&gt;{{cite web | title=Amazon | work=The NPR Curious Listener's Guide to American Folk Music, by Kip Lornell (Author), Linda Ronstadt (Foreword)  | url=https://www.amazon.com/Curious-Listeners-Guide-American-Music/dp/0399530339 | accessdate=May 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linda Ronstadt]] wrote the [[foreword]].

In 2007, [[James P. Leary]] published ''Polkabilly: How the Goose Island Ramblers Redefined American Folk Music'', which proposes a redefinition of traditional American folk music and identifies a new genre of music from the [[Upper Midwest]] known as ''Polkabilly'', which blends ethnic music, old-time country music, and polka.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/jamerfolk.123.489.0363 "Journal of American Folklore: Review"], Retrieved 27 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was awarded the [[American Folklore Society]]’s Chicago Folklore Prize for the best book in the field of folklore scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afsnet.org/?page=Chicago "Chicago Folklore Prize"], Retrieved 27 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The soundtrack of the 2000 [[film]] ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'' is exclusively roots music, performed by [[Alison Krauss]], [[The Fairfield Four]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Norman Blake (American musician)|Norman Blake]] and others.

In 2001, [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] broadcast a 4-part [[documentary film|documentary]] series, ''American Roots Music,'' that explored the historical roots of American roots music through footage and performances by the creators of the movement.

The 2003 film ''[[A Mighty Wind]]'' is a tribute to (and parody of) the folk-pop musicians of the early 1960s.

A six-hour public television series, ''The Music of America: History Through Musical Traditions,'' appeared in 2010.

'''''Ang mga Anak Dalita''''' ("[The] Children of the Poor"&lt;ref name=Itunes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/ang-mga-anak-dalita-children/id397317165?mt=11|title=Ang mga Anak Dalita (Children of the Poor) by Patricio Mariano|publisher=Apple Inc|accessdate=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a 1911 [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]-language novel written by [[Filipino people|Filipino]] novelist [[Patricio Mariano]].  The 73-page novel was published in [[Manila]] by Limbagan at Aklatan Ni I.R. Morales (Printing Press And Library of I.R. Morales) during the [[History of the Philippines (1898&amp;ndash;1946)|American era]] in [[Philippine history]] (1898&amp;ndash;1946).  ''Ang mga Anak Dalita'' is a [[political novel]] that deals also with Filipino ideology, the socio-economic situation, the industrial upheaval, and the struggle of the oppressed Filipino working class in Manila during Mariano’s time.&lt;ref name=Itunes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Filipiniana/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Ang mga Anak Dalita bookcover2.jpg|right|Contemporary cover|200px]]
Mariano wrote ''Ang mga Anak Dalita'' in [[poetic form]].  The theme of the novel is about how the poor in the Philippines become poorer by being exploited by capitalists.  According to literary critic [[Soledad Reyes]], there was a scene in the novel wherein Ata, the main female protagonist, narrates a story about how the Philippines (represented by the name "Mutya", meaning "pearl", "precious stone", or "charmstone"&lt;ref name=Bansa1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bansa.org/dictionaries/tgl/?dict_lang=tgl&amp;type=search&amp;data=mutya|title=Mutya, pearl, precious stone, charmstone|publisher=Bansa|accessdate=July 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) became the victim of Spain (represented by the name "Dulong", a type of small fish&lt;ref name=Bansa2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bansa.org/dictionaries/tgl/?dict_lang=tgl&amp;type=search&amp;data=dulong|title=Dulong|publisher=Bansa|accessdate=July 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as the ''Gobiopterus lacustris'' (Lacustrine goby), which belongs to the [[Gobiidae]] family),&lt;ref name=Mongabay&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fish.mongabay.com/data/Philippines.htm|title=Gobiidae, Gobiopterus lacustris, Lacustrine goby, Dulong, List of Freshwater Fishes for Philippines|first=Rhett|last=Buttler|publisher=Mongabay.com|accessdate=July 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States (represented by the name "Limatik", meaning "[[leech]]"&lt;ref name=Gabby&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gabbydictionary.com/home.asp|title=Leech, limatik|publisher=Gabby's Dictionary|accessdate=July 4, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110711062445/http://www.gabbydictionary.com/home.asp| archivedate= July 11, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name=Filipiniana/&gt; Based on Philippine history, the Philippines was colonized by Spain from 1521 to 1898, and then by the United States from 1898 to 1946.&lt;ref name=Filipiniana/&gt;

==Plot==
The characters of the novel include Ata, Teta, Pedro, and a factory owner.  Ata is a poor woman.  Teta is Ata’s daughter.  Pedro is Ata’s lover.  The factory owner in the novel is the “[[avarice|avaricious]]” and “[[lust]]ful" boss of Ata. The factory owner tried to rape Ata, but she was able to escape.  During a conflict with the laborers, Ata’s daughter Teta saves the factory owner from being killed by the factory workers.  In the end, Teta turns out to be the daughter of the factory owner.  The theme of the novel is similar to Mariano’s other novel ''[[Ang Tala sa Panghulo]]'' ("The Bright Star at Panghulo").&lt;ref name=Filipiniana&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filipiniana.net/publication/ang-mga-anak-dalita/12791881584511 |title=Ang mga Anak Dalita by Mariano, Patricio |publisher=Filipiniana |accessdate=June 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128225829/http://www.filipiniana.net/publication/ang-mga-anak-dalita/12791881584511 |archivedate=January 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It opened on November 8, 2010 with an acclaimed performance of [[Piaf (play)|Piaf]] by the [[Beersheba Theater]] company.&lt;ref&gt;Chaim Levinson, "Major theaters raise curtain across Green Line", ''[[Haaretz]]'', 25 August 2010 [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/major-theaters-raise-curtain-across-green-line-1.310040 full text]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The opening was mired by an intended boycott by sixty actors, writers, and directors, including [[Joshua Sobol]], who refuse to perform in settlements because it would "strengthen the settlement enterprise".

'''Avenida de Colores, Inc.''' was founded in 2010 by Denise Kowal as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sunbiz.org/scripts/cordet.exe?action=DETFIL&amp;inq_doc_number=N10000007673&amp;inq_came_from=NAMFWD&amp;cor_web_names_seq_number=0000&amp;names_name_ind=N&amp;names_cor_number=&amp;names_name_seq=&amp;names_name_ind=&amp;names_comp_name=AVENIDADECOLORES&amp;names_filing_type=|title= Florida Non-Profit Corporation Details (Avenida de Colores, Inc.)|work= Florida Department of State Division of Corporations|publisher= State of Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Sarasota, Florida]] in the [[United States]]. The corporation is organized for the purpose of providing students with experiences and instruction in the visual and performing arts and to enrich communities with cultural events. The corporation produces the [[Sarasota Chalk Festival]], a cultural event designed to that celebrate the sixteenth century [[performing arts|performance art]] of [[Italy|Italian]] [[street painting]]. The corporation functions solely on donations from patrons, sponsorships, and grants and it is a fully volunteer organization.

==First international street painting festival in the U.S.==

While pursuing its mission to create cultural events, in 2010, the Avenida de Colores made history by producing the first international street painting festival in the United States, called the ''[[Sarasota Chalk Festival]]''. Street painting festivals started in the United States in 1987, but this festival was the first to attract many renowned street painting artists from all over the world to participate. The festival had notable [[Guinness World Record]] holders [[Edgar Mueller]] from [[Germany]], Leon Keer from [[Netherlands]], and [[Tracy Lee Stum]] from the USA. Genna Panzarella from the USA, who was the first woman to receive Italy's honorable Maestra Madonnari title at the International Grazi di [[Curtatone]] competition, participated as well as Vera Bugatti from Italy, who also holds the Maestra Madonnari title. Maestro Madonnaro Edgar Mueller created a 100' x 40' 3-D street painting that is the first known contemporary street painting that [[metamorphosis|metamorphosed]] from one image to another with the change from day to night because the painter used [[photoluminescence|photoluminescent]] paints. The Sarasota Chalk Festival also was the first street painting festival to have a [[Halloween]]-theme for the artists work as well as three oversized 3-D installations, one of which incorporating [[two-point perspective]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20101028/ARTICLE/10281004|title= Street art goes global this year|author= Weingarten, Abby|date=  October 28, 2010|work= [[Sarasota Herald Tribune]]|publisher= The New York Times Company|page= E6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20101028/ARTICLE/10281004|title= Artists to make the pavement come alive in Sarasota|author= Ball, David|date= October 23, 2010|work= [[Sarasota Herald Tribune]]|publisher= The New York Times Company|page= BN1|accessdate= December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.yourobserver.com/news/sarasota/Front-Page/102920108602/WEEKEND-BEST-BET-Sarasota-Chalk-Festival|title= Weekend Best Bet: Sarasota Chalk Festival|author= Observer Staff|date= October 29, 2010|work= Your Observer.Com|publisher= The Observer Group|accessdate= December 7, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101101034857/http://www.yourobserver.com/news/sarasota/Front-Page/102920108602/WEEKEND-BEST-BET-Sarasota-Chalk-Festival| archivedate= 1 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/press/around-world-downtown-sarasota,1499527.html|title= Around World Downtown Sarasota|author= Sarasota Chalk Festival|date= October 12, 2010|work= Earth Times|accessdate= December 8, 2010|archive-url= https://archive.is/20120729012810/http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/press/around-world-downtown-sarasota,1499527.html|archive-date= 2012-07-29|dead-url= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;


A catalogue ''(right)'' entitled, '''''Sarasota Chalk Festival''''', was published by Avenida de Colores following the 2010 festival. Exceeding two hundred pages, it provides an extensive history of the street painting it features at the festival and discusses many of the artists who have become famous for performing the art at various locations around the world. Many of these artists performed at the debut of the new international status of the festival. The catalogue provides examples of their work—either here or abroad, some being works produced at the 2010 festival, which had a festive Halloween theme. It also describes the music and arts present in Sarasota, which has earned the area the reputation as the "Cultural Coast" of Florida. It also presents information about many of the attractive Sarasota beaches has on the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. This catalogue has been available at each festival since its publication and is available at the festival offices throughout the year. 

==Sarasota Chalk Festival History==

As president of the Burns Square Property Owners Association, Inc., in 2007, Kowal founded a nonprofit corporation, the Avenida de Colores Chalk Festival, a street painting festival held on South Pineapple Avenue in the downtown Sarasota historic area known as [[Owen Burns|Burns Square]]. Only twenty-two artists participated in this first festival. Lori Escalera, a leading modern [[Madonnari]] from the USA was the only professional street painter who participated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20071110/NEWS/711100467?p=1&amp;tc=pg&amp;tc=ar|title= Blood, toil, tears and chalk|author= Hutchinson, Bill|date= November 10, 2007|work= [[Sarasota Herald Tribune]]|publisher= The New York Times Company|page= A1|accessdate= December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the second Avenida de Colores Chalk Festival was held with approximately one hundred street painters participating, who were drawn from all over the USA, and more than two hundred local stage performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20090429/BREAKING/904299959|title= Artists will use Pineapple Street as their canvas|author=  Weingarten, Abby|date= April 29, 2009|work= [[Sarasota Herald Tribune]]|publisher= The New York Times Company|accessdate= December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20090430/ARTICLE/904301029|title= Art in a race against time|author=  Hendricks, Joe|date= April 30, 2009|work= [[Sarasota Herald Tribune]]|publisher= The New York Times Company|page=E6|accessdate= December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20090506/OPINION/905061013|title= Art on the street|date= May 6, 2009|work= [[Sarasota Herald Tribune]]|publisher= The New York Times Company|page= A8|accessdate= December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Burns Square Property Owners Association relinquished the Avenida de Colores Chalk Festival to the Avenida de Colores nonprofit corporation. The street painting festival was renamed the Sarasota Chalk Festival and has grown into one of the most important street painting festivals in the world. The festival expanded several blocks in Burns Square to accommodate the two hundred and fifty street painters who participated, being drawn from all over the world, which made the Sarasota Chalk Festival the first international street painting festival in the United States. 

The festival has been relocated to [[Venice, Florida|Venice]] (also in Sarasota County) where more space is available to accommodate the large crowds attracted to the event.

[[File:Ebony Bones backup performer.jpg|thumb|One of the Wives, the backing vocalists for English singer [[Ebony Bones]]]]
'''Backing vocalists''' (British English) or '''backup singers''' (American English) are [[singer]]s who provide [[vocal harmony]] with the [[lead vocalist]] or other backing vocalists. In some cases, a backing vocalist may sing alone as a lead-in to the main vocalist's entry or to sing a [[counter-melody]]. Backing vocalists are used in a broad range of [[popular music]], [[traditional music]] and [[world music]] styles.

Solo artists may employ professional backing vocalists in studio recording sessions as well as during concerts. In many [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] bands (e.g., the [[power trio]]), the musicians doing backing vocals also play instruments, such as guitar, electric bass, drums, or keyboards. In [[Music of Latin America|Latin]] or [[Afro-Cuban]] groups, backing singers may play percussion instruments or shakers while singing. In some pop and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] groups and in [[musical theater]], the backing singers may be required to perform elaborately choreographed dance routines while they sing through headset microphones.

The style of singing used by backing singers varies according to the type of song and the genre of music the band plays. In pop and country songs, backing vocalists may perform vocal harmony parts to support the lead vocalist. In hardcore punk or rockabilly, other band members who play instruments may sing or shout backing vocals during the chorus (refrain) section of the songs.

==Terminology==
Alternative terms for backing vocalists include ''backing singers'', ''backing vocals'', ''additional vocals'' or, particularly in the United States and Canada, ''backup singers'' or sometimes ''background singers'' or ''harmony vocalists''.

==Examples==
While some bands use performers whose sole on-stage role is performing backing vocals, it is common for backing singers to have other roles. Two notable examples of band members who sang back-up are [[The Beach Boys]] and [[The Beatles]]. The Beach Boys were well known for their close vocal harmonies, occasionally with all five members singing at once such as "[[In My Room]]" and "[[Surfer Girl (song)|Surfer Girl]]". All five members would sing lead, although most often [[Brian Wilson]] or [[Mike Love]] would sing lead with guitarists [[Carl Wilson]] and [[Al Jardine]] and drummer [[Dennis Wilson]] singing background harmonies. 

The Beatles were also known for their close style of vocal harmonies{{opinion|date=September 2011}} – all Beatles members sang both lead and backing vocals at some point, especially [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]], who frequently supported each other with harmonies, often with fellow Beatle [[George Harrison]] joining in. [[Ringo Starr]], while not as prominent in the role of backing singer as his three bandmates due to his distinctive voice, can be heard singing backing vocals in such tracks as "[[The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill]]" and "[[Carry That Weight]]".  Examples of three-part harmonies by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison include "[[Nowhere Man (song)|Nowhere Man]]", "[[Because (The Beatles song)|Because]]", "[[Day Tripper]]", and "[[This Boy]]".
The members of [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young]] and [[Bee Gees]] all each wrote songs and sang back-up or lead vocals and played various instruments on their albums and various collaborations with each other.

Former [[guitarist]] [[John Frusciante]] and current guitarist [[Josh Klinghoffer]] of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] sing nearly all backing vocals (few songs were recorded without backing vocals), often singing some parts without accompaniment from lead vocalist [[Anthony Kiedis]]. The band's bassist [[Michael Balzary|Flea]] occasionally filled in for additional vocals. Frusciante usually sang one song by himself during concerts. Another example is "No Frontiers" by [[The Corrs]], which is sung by Sharon and Caroline.

Other backing vocalists include [[Sebastien Lefebvre]] ([[rhythm guitarist]] at the same time) and [[David Desrosiers]] ([[Bass guitarist]], also at the same time ) for [[pop punk]] band [[Simple Plan]], [[John Petrucci]] of [[Dream Theater]], and guitarists [[Zacky Vengeance]] and [[Synyster Gates]] of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Avenged Sevenfold]].

==Lead singers who record backing vocals==
In the recording studio, some lead singers record their own backing vocals by [[overdubbing]] with a [[multitrack recording]] system. A multitrack recording system enables the [[record producer]] to add many layers of recordings over top of each other. Using a multitrack system, a lead vocalist can record his or her own backing vocals, and then record the lead vocal part over top. Some lead vocalists prefer this approach because the sound of their own harmonies will blend well with their main vocal. 

One famous example is [[Freddie Mercury]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] singing the first part of "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" himself by overdubbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McAlpine|first1=Fraser|title=10 Things You May Not Know About Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody'|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2015/10/10-things-you-may-not-know-about-queens-bohemian-rhapsody|publisher=[[BBC America]]|accessdate=16 May 2017|date=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patrick Stump]] of [[Fall Out Boy]], [[Wednesday 13]], in his own band, and as the lead and backing vocalist of [[Murderdolls]], [[Ian Gillan]] of [[Deep Purple]], [[Simon Le Bon]] of [[Duran Duran]] and [[Brad Delp]] of [[Boston (band)|Boston]] also recorded lead and backing vocals for their albums.

With the exception of a few songs on each album, [[Dan Fogelberg]], [[Eddie Rabbitt]], [[David Bowie]] and [[Richard Marx]] sing all of the background vocals for their songs. [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] of [[the Cure]] not only sings his own backing vocals in the studio, but also doesn't perform with backing vocalists when playing live.

==Different approaches==
Many [[metalcore]] and some [[post-hardcore]] bands, such as [[As I Lay Dying (band)|As I Lay Dying]], [[Alexisonfire]], [[Haste the Day]] and [[Silverstein (band)|Silverstein]] feature a main vocalist who performs using [[harsh vocals]], whilst the backing vocalist sings harmonies ([[clean vocals]]) during choruses to create a contrast. Some bands, such as [[Hawthorne Heights]] and [[Finch (American band)|Finch]] have the backing singers do harsh vocals to highlight specific lyrics.

[[Pop music|Pop]] and [[R&amp;B]] vocalists such as [[Diana Ross]], [[Ariana Grande]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Beyoncé Knowles]], [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], [[Faith Evans]], [[D'Angelo]], [[Mary J. Blige]] and [[Amerie]] have become known specifically for not only recording their own backing vocals, but for arranging their own multi-tracked vocals and even developing highly complex harmonies and arrangements.  When they perform live, they may have backing vocalists who impersonate their voices.

==Unusual backing vocal styles==
Some bands use backing vocals in order to contrast with the lead singer who may be performing an unusual vocal technique. For example, [[Brian "Head" Welch]], the [[lead guitarist]] of the band [[Korn]], performed backing vocals on several songs, and notably on the song "[[Ball Tongue]]", he screams the chorus while lead vocalist [[Jonathan Davis]] sings incomprehensible [[scat singing|scat vocals]]. Similarly, the Canadian [[deathcore]] group [[Despised Icon]] uses two vocalists, one performing screams and another performing low, growling [[death grunt]]s who alternate, and sometimes sing in unison to highlight certain lyrics. In [[rap music]], a background rapper who chants and rhymes to support the main artist is often referred to as [[hype man]].

==Career paths==
Working as a backing singer can give a vocalist the onstage experience and vocal training they need to develop into a lead vocalist. A number of lead vocalists such as [[Ace Frehley]], [[Richard Marx]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Cher]], [[Gwen Stefani]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Trisha Yearwood]], [[Dave Grohl]], [[Jerry Only]], [[Jerry Cantrell]], [[Jason Newsted]], [[Dee Dee Ramone]] and [[Elton John]], learned their craft as backing singers, or singing backing vocals as part of a choir.{{fact|date=May 2013}}&lt;!-- These unsourced lists can be a real source of Hoaxing on WP...people just add in names for fun --&gt;

'''Native American pottery''' is an art form with at least a 7500-year history in [[the Americas]].{{sfn|Silverman|Isbell|2008|p=365}} Pottery is fired ceramics with clay as a component. Ceramics are used for utilitarian cooking vessels, serving and storage vessels, pipes, funerary urns, [[censer]]s, musical instruments, ceremonial items, masks, toys, sculptures, and a myriad of other art forms.

Due to their resilience, ceramics have been key to learning more about [[Pre-Columbian cultures|Precolumbian indigenous cultures]].

==Materials and techniques==
[[File:Tile, late 19th-early 20th century, X1047.7.jpg|thumbnail|alt=Hopi Pueblo ceramic tile from the late 19th-early 20th century, in the Brooklyn Museum|Tile, Hopi Pueblo (Native American), late 19th-early 20th century, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
The [[List of pottery terms#Clay body|clay body]] is a necessary component of pottery. Clay must be mined and purified in an often laborious process, and certain tribes have ceremonial protocols to gathering clay. Different tribes have different processes for processing clay, which can include drying in the sun, soaking in water for days, and repeatedly running through a screen or sieve. [[Acoma Pueblo|Acoma]] and other Pueblo pottery traditionally pound dry clay into a powder and then remove impurities by hand, then running the dry powder through a screen, mixing it with a dry temper, and then mixing water to create a plastic paste.&lt;ref name=holmes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holmes.anthropology.museum/southwestpottery/pueblopottery.html|title=Through the Eyes of a Pot: How is Pueblo Pottery Made?|work=Lowell D. Holmes Museum of Anthropology|accessdate=2 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209012627/http://www.holmes.anthropology.museum/southwestpottery/pueblopottery.html|archivedate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparing the clay, potters spend hours wedging it to remove air pockets and humidity that could easily cause it to explode during firing. The clay then needs to "cure" over time.&lt;ref name="BerloPhillips1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berlo|first1=Janet Catherine|authorlink1=Janet Catherine Berlo|last2=Phillips|first2=Ruth Bliss|title=Native North American Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sltpV3pvZjoC|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-284218-3|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coiling (pottery)|Coiling]] is the most common means of shaping ceramics in the Americas. In coiling, the clay is rolled into a long, thin strands that are coiled upon each other to build up the shape of the pottery. While the potter builds the coils up, she also blends them together until there was no trace of the ropes of clay entwined to form the pot, no deviation in the thickness of the walls, and therefore no weaknesses. [[Potter's wheel]]s were not used prior to European contact and are only used today by a limited number of [[Native American art]]ists. [[Pinch pot]]s and other small clay objects could be formed directly by hand. [[Hohokam]] potters and their descendents in the [[American Southwest]] employed the [[paddle-and-anvil]] technique, in which the interior clay wall of a pot was supported by an anvil, while the exterior was beaten with a paddle, smoothing the surface.{{sfn|Cooper|2000|p=186}} In precontact South America, ceramics were mass-produced using molds.

[[Slip (ceramics)|Slip]] is a liquid clay suspension of mineral pigments applied to the ceramics before firing. Slips are typically red, buff, white, and black; however, [[Nazca culture]] ceramic artists in [[Peru]] perfected 13 distinct colors of slips. They also used a hand-rotated turntable that allowed all sides of a ceramic piece to be painted with ease. These were first used in 500 BCE and continue to be used today.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|pp=69-70}} Slips can be applied overall in washes, creating large color fields, often with cloth, or they can be painted in fine detail with brushes. [[Yucca]] leaves, chewed slightly to loosen fibers, make excellent brushes that are still in use today in the American Southwest. [[Negative painting]] is a technique employed by precontact [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] potters in the [[Eastern Woodlands]], Mayan potters in Mesoamerica, and others, which involves covering the ceramic piece in beeswax or another resist, incised a design in the resist, then soaking the piece with a slip. In the firing process the resists melts away, leaving the colored design.

While still green, pottery can be incised with designs. Cords, textiles, baskets, and corncobs have been rolled over wet clay, both as a decoration and to improve heat dispersion in cooking pots. Carved wood or ceramic stamping paddles are used throughout the [[Southeastern Woodlands]] to create repeating designs. Clay can also be added to the main ceramic structure to build up designs.

Before firing, ceramics can be [[Burnishing (pottery)|burnish]]ed or polished to a fine sheen with a smooth instrument, usually a stone. [[Ceramic glaze|Glaze]]s are seldom used by indigenous American ceramic artists. Grease can be rubbed onto the pot as well.&lt;ref name=holmes/&gt;

Prior to contact, pottery was usually open-air fired or pit fired; precontact [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico]] used kilns extensively. Today many Native American ceramic artists use [[kiln]]s. In pit-firing, the pot is placed in a shallow pit dug into the earth along with other unfired pottery, covered with wood and brush, or dung, then set on fire whereupon it can harden at temperatures of 1400 degrees or more. Finally, the ceramics surface is often polished with smooth stones.

===Tempers===
Tempers are non-plastic materials added to clay to prevent shrinkage and cracking during drying and firing of vessels made from the clay.&lt;ref name=MVAC&gt;{{cite web|title=Ceramics|url=http://www.uwlax.edu/mvac/research/technologies.htm#Ceramics|work=Mississippi Valley Archaeology Center – Technologies|publisher=University of Wisconsin – La Crosse|accessdate=4 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927110643/http://www.uwlax.edu/mvac/Research/technologies.htm#Ceramics|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tempers may include:

Not all Indigenous American pottery requires added tempers; some [[Hopi people|Hopi]] potters use pure [[kaolin clay]] that does not require tempering.&lt;ref name="BerloPhillips1998"/&gt; Some clays naturally contain enough temper that they do not required additional tempers. This includes mica or sand in clays used in some [[Taos Pueblo]], [[Picuris Pueblo]], and Hopi pottery,&lt;ref name=holmes/&gt; and sponge spicules in the clay used to produce the "chalky ware" of the [[St. Johns culture]].&lt;ref name=pelotes/&gt;

Ceramics are often used to identify [[archaeological culture]]s. The type of temper (or mix of tempers) used helps to distinguish the ceramics produced by different cultures during particular time periods. Grog, sand, and sandstone were all used by [[Ancestral Pueblo people]] and other Southwestern cultures.&lt;ref name="BerloPhillips1998"/&gt; Crushed bone was used as temper in at least some ceramics at a number of sites in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Southeast Texas Archaeology|url=http://www.houstonarcheology.org/setexas/ceramics.html|publisher=Houston Archaeological Society|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Southeastern United States]], the earliest ceramics were tempered with fiber such as [[Spanish moss]] and [[Serenoa|palmetto]] leaves. In Louisiana, fiber as tempering was replaced first by grog and later by shell. In peninsular Florida and coastal Georgia sand replaced fiber as tempering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|last1=Lopez|first1=Adrienne|last2=Fullen|first2=Steve|title=Examining Pottery with Scope-On-A-Rope|url=http://appl027.lsu.edu/MNSEducation/Saturday/LA%20Indians%201.pdf|work=Adventures in Archaeology|publisher=Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science|accessdate=5 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415143643/http://appl027.lsu.edu/MNSEducation/Saturday/LA%20Indians%201.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Milanich|1994|pp=86, 94}} Still later, freshwater sponge spicules became an important temper in the "chalky ware" of the [[St. Johns culture]] in northeastern Florida.&lt;ref name=pelotes/&gt; Locally produced ceramics of the [[Lucayan people]] in the [[Bahamas]] were characterized by crushed [[conch]] shell tempering, as opposed to the quartz sand-tempered ware imported from [[Hispaniola]].&lt;ref name="Craton1986"&gt;{{cite book|last=Craton|first=Michael|title=A History of the Bahamas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-jcYAAAAYAAJ|year=1986|publisher=San Salvador Press|isbn=978-0-9692568-0-9|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of temper used in ceramics was constrained by what was available, but changes in the choice of temper can provide clues to influence and trade relations between groups. Shell-tempered ware was produced sporadically in various places across the eastern United States, but in the late [[Woodland period|Woodland]] and early [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] periods it became the predominant temper used across much of the [[Mississippi Valley]] and middle [[Gulf Coast of the United States|gulf coast]], and a major defining characteristic of [[Mississippian culture pottery]].{{sfn|Weinstein|Dumas|2008|p=202}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.museumofnativeamericanartifacts.org/mississippian.html |title=Museum of Native American Artifacts-MISSISSIPPIAN PERIOD 900 AD - 1450 AD|accessdate=2010-07-18}}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and spread==
The earliest ceramics known from the Americas have been found in the lower [[Amazon Basin]]. Ceramics from the Caverna de Pedra Pintada, near [[Santarém, Pará|Santarém, Brazil]], have been dated to 7,500 to 5,000 [[Before Present|years ago]]. Ceramics from Taperinha, also near Santarém, have been dated to 7,000 to 6,000 years ago. Some of the [[potsherds|sherds]] at Taperinho were shell-tempered, which allowed the sherds themselves to be [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]]. These first ceramics-making cultures were fishers and shellfish-gatherers.{{sfn|Roosevelt|1996|pp=318-319}}

Ceramics appeared next across northern South America and then down the western side of South America and northward through [[Mesoamerica]]. Ceramics of the [[Alaka culture]] in [[Guyana]] have been dated to 6,000 to 4,500 years ago.{{sfn|Roosevelt|1996|pp=318-319}} Ceramics of the [[San Jacinto culture]] in [[Colombia]] have been dated to about 4530 [[Common Era|BCE]], and at [[Puerto Hormiga archaeological site|Puerto Hormiga]], also in Colombia, to about 3794 BCE. Ceramics appeared in the [[Valdivia culture]] in [[Ecuador]] around 3200 BCE, and in the [[Pandanche culture]] in [[Peru]] around 2460 BCE.{{sfn|Clark|Gosser|1995|pp=210-11}}

The spread of ceramics in Mesoamerica came later. Ceramics from [[Monagrillo (archaeological site)|Monagrillo]] in [[Panama]] been dated to around 2140 BCE, from Tronadora in [[Costa Rica]] to around 1890 BCE, and from Barra in [[Guatemala]] to around 1682 BCE. Ceramics of the Purrón tradition in southcentral [[Mexico]] have been dated to around 1805 BCE, and from the Chajil tradition of northcentral Mexico, to around 1600 BCE.{{sfn|Clark|Gosser|1995|pp=210-11}}

The appearance of ceramics in the [[Southeastern United States]] does not fit the above pattern. Ceramics from the middle [[Savannah River]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]] (known as Stallings, Stallings Island, or St. Simons) have been dated to about 2888 BCE (4500 BP), and ceramics of the [[Orange culture|Orange]] and [[Norwood culture|Norwood]] cultures in northern [[Florida]] to around 2460 BCE (4300 BP) (all older than any other dated ceramics from north of Colombia). Ceramics appeared later elsewhere in North America. Ceramics reached southern Florida ([[Mount Elizabeth Archeological Site|Mount Elizabeth]]) by 4000 BP, [[Nebo Hill Archeological Site|Nebo Hill]] (in [[Missouri]]) by 3700 BP, and [[Poverty Point]] (in Louisiana) by 3400 BP.{{sfn|Clark|Gosser|1995|pp=210-11}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=John E, Michelle Knoll|title=Gulf Coast Archaeology: The Southeastern United States and Mexico|year=2005|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville, Florida|isbn=0-8130-2808-6|editor=Nancy Marie White|page=286|chapter=The American Formative Revisited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural regions==

===Arctic===
Several [[Inuit]] communities, such as the [[Netsilik]], [[Sadlermiut]], [[Utkuhiksalik]], and [[Qaernerimiut]] created utilitarian pottery in historic times,&lt;ref&gt;Savelle, James M. [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=5403508 "Historic Inuit Pottery in the Eastern Canadian Arctic: Abstract."] ''[[Polar Record]].'' (1986), 23: pp. 319-322. (Retrieved 4 Nov 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; primarily to store food. In [[Rankin Inlet]], [[Nunavut, Canada]], when the mine that employed much of the community closed down, the national government created the Rankin Inlet Ceramics Project, whose wares were successfully exhibited in Toronto in 1967. The project foundered but a local gallery revived interest in Inuit ceramics in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nacaarts.com/english/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=113&amp;Itemid=108 "Ceramics."] ''Nunavut Arts and Crafts Association.''

===Eastern Woodlands===
*[[Hopewell pottery]] is the ceramic tradition of the various local cultures involved in the [[Hopewell tradition]] (ca. 200 BCE to 400 CE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=241&amp;term_type_id=3&amp;term_type_text=things&amp;letter=H|title=Hopewell (archaeology)|work=Wisconsin Historical Society|accessdate=19 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109143824/http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=241&amp;term_type_id=3&amp;term_type_text=things&amp;letter=H|archivedate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are found as [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] in [[archeological site]]s in the American Midwest and Southeast.
*[[Mississippian culture pottery]] is the ceramic tradition of the [[Mississippian culture]] (800–1600 CE) found as [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] in [[archaeological site]]s in the American Midwest and Southeast.

====Southeastern Woodlands====
Geological studies show that that certain areas of the southeastern portion of North America are rich in kaolins and ball clays (Hosterman, USGS),{{clarify|date=August 2018|unclear what source is being cited}} the types of plastic clays best suited for pottery. Clay beds which still produce ceramic clays are from primary and secondary deposits formed in the Late Paleocene and Early Miocene Epochs in formations that formed the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]]. According to all geological surveys the entire southeastern portion of the continent has abundant clay deposits, with the exception of all of south Florida and a portion of western central Florida (Calver) (Matson).{{clarify|date=August 2018|unclear what source is being cited}}

Fiber-tempered ceramics associated with [[shell midden]]s left by Late [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] hunter-fisher-gatherers appeared in the [[Atlantic coastal plain]] of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina starting in 2500 BC. The earliest attested pottery is in the [[Stallings Island|Stallings culture]] area, around the middle [[Savannah River]].{{refn|Fiber-tempered [[potsherd]]s found at Rabbit Mount near the lower Savannah River in South Carolina have been dated to 4465 ± 95 and 4450 ± 150 radiocarbon years before present.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saunders|2002|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} Fiber-tempered pottery of the [[Orange culture]] in northeast Florida has been dated to 2000 BC or a bit earlier.{{sfn|Walthall|1980|pp=78, 80, 82-83}}{{sfn|Milanich|1994|p=94}} Fiber-tempered pottery of very similar form spread along coasts and river valleys of the Southeastern United States from the Atlantic coast into Alabama, reaching northwestern Florida ([[Norwood culture]]) and the Gulf coast by 1300 BC, the interior Middle South by 1100, and [[Poverty Point]] by 1000 BC.{{sfn|Walthall|1980|pp=80, 83, 87}}&lt;ref name="GibsonCarr2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Nancy Marie|editor1=Jon L.

Thoms Creek ceramics closely resembled Stallings ceramics, but used more sand and less fiber as temper than Stalling or Orange ware. Thoms Creek ceramics were largely contemporary with Stalling and Orange ceramics, although no Thoms Creek ceramics have been found that are as early as the earliest Stallings. Thoms Creek ceramics overlapped Stallings ceramics in northern Georgia and southern South Carolina, but were the dominant tradition north of the [[Santee River]] into North Carolina.&lt;ref name="SaundersHays2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saunders|first1=Rebecca|last2=Hays|first2=Christopher T.|title=Early Pottery: Technology, Function, Style, and Interaction in the Lower Southeast|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LtAyG_LQ6DsC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=19 November 2016|year=2004|publisher=University of Alabama Press|location=Tuscaloosa|isbn=978-0-8173-5127-4|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The similarities of the Stallings series ceramics to the earlier [[Puerto Hormiga archaeological site|Puerto Hormiga]] ceramics of Colombia, which were both associated with [[shell ring]]s, and the presence of winds and ocean currents favoring journeys from South America to the Southeastern United States, led [[James A. Ford]], among other archaeologists, to offer the hypothesis that the two areas had connections, and that the technology of fiber-tempered ceramics in the southeastern United States had been imported from Colombia. Other archaeologists have noted that there are no known archaeological sites between Colombia and Florida that are of a type or age consistent with such connections, and that the cultural traditions of the Southeastern United States show no significant changes associated with the appearance of ceramics, indicating that there was no migration or people, and no transfer of technology or other elements of culture, other than the appearance of ceramics.{{sfn|Walthall|1980|pp=82–83}}

Later significant developments in ceramics in the Southeastern Woodlands included [[Mississippian culture pottery]] in the Mississippi River valley, and [[Weedon Island culture|Weedon Island pottery]], a style of pottery used primarily in ceremonial contexts and high status burials, produced and traded along the Gulf of Mexico coast from southwestern Florida to the Florida panhandle.

===Great Basin===
[[Indigenous peoples of the Great Basin]] based their pottery on [[basketry]]. The [[Fremont culture]] of central [[Utah]] (700–1300 CE) developed pottery after adopting agriculture. [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] and [[Washoe people]] in the western Great Basin developed plain, utilitarian ceramics separately, which was not burnished but occasionally featured red painted designs. The Owens Valley Brown Ware is an example of Paiute/Washoe ceramics, which was used for cooking, food storage, and water jugs. The jugs often featured clay handles that accommodated carrying straps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beckman|first=Tad|url=http://www4.hmc.edu:8001/humanities/basin/gb-matrl.htm|title=Great Basin Material Cultures|publisher=Harvey Mudd College|date=1996|accessdate=4 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007062753/http://www4.hmc.edu:8001/humanities/basin/gb-matrl.htm|archivedate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circum-Caribbean===

====Antilles====
Ceramics first appeared in the [[Antilles]] as part of the [[Saladoid]] culture (named for the Saladero site in the [[Orinoco]] basin in [[Venezuela]]. Saladoid people appeared in [[Trinidad]] around 500 BC or a little later, and had reached [[Puerto Rico]] by about 250 BC. The [[Cedros, Trinidad and Tobago|Cedrosan]] variety of Saladoid ceramics appeared in Trinidad early on, although ceramics in the Antilles continued to closely resemble forms on the Venezuela coast into the [[Current Era]]. Cedrosan Saladoid vessels have a distinctive bell shape with "zone-incised cross-hatching". Many also have complex designs of white on red paint. Later examples were decorated with purple, black, yellow and orange paint. These ceramics are described as "technologically fine, delicate, and graceful."{{sfn|Wilson|1997|p=5}}{{sfn|Allaire|1997|pp=22-24}}

Other ceramics styles are also known from the Antilles during this time period. Barrancoid trade wares, of a style that had developed in the Orinoco River valley around 1000 BC, have been found in the southernmost Antilles; Trinidad, [[Tobago]], and [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]]. A variant of Saladoid ceramics called Huecan has been found from the north coast of Venezuela to Puerto Rico.{{sfn|Righter|1997|pp=72-74}}

====Colombia and Venezuela====
Fiber-tempered ceramics associated with shell middens left by hunter-fisher-gatherers of the Early Northwest South American Literature appeared at sites such as [[Puerto Hormiga archaeological site|Puerto Hormiga]], Monsú, Puerto Chacho, and San Jacinto in [[Colombia]] by 3100 BCE. Fiber-tempered ceramics at Monsú have been dated to 5940 radiocarbon years [[Before Present|before present]]. The fiber-tempered pottery at Puerto Hormiga was "crude", formed from a single lump of clay. The fiber-tempered pottery at San Jaginto is described as "well-made". Sand-tempered coiled ceramics have also been found at Puerto Horrible.{{sfn|Walthall|1980|pp=82-83}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor1-first=Peter Neal|editor1-last=Peregrine|editor1-link=Peter N.

[[Ráquira]], a town in the [[Boyacá Department]], Colombia, is a major ceramics center, where both indigenous techniques and those introduced by Europeans are employed to create primarily utilitarian pots based on [[Chibcha people|Chibcha]] designs. Ceramic mobiles, [[nativity scene]]s, and animal figurines are popular, especially ceramic horses, which have been the symbol of Colombian pottery.{{sfn|Davies|Fini|1995|p=122}}

La Chamba in the [[Tolima Department]] is known for its blackware. The women potters here also create brown and red ware.{{sfn|Davies|Fini|1995|p=123}}

In the Andes, ceramics appear during the Initial Period around 1800 BCE. They were needed for boiling agricultural foods{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|p=23}} [[Chavín culture|Chavín]] potters on the Peruvian coast create distinctive [[stirrup spout vessel]]s, both incised and highly burnished. These thin-walled effigy pots were fashioned to resemble stylized humans, plants, and animals. Two substyles of Chavín stirrup spout pots include the thicker-walls, glossy-on-matte blackware Cupisnique style and red and black Santa Ana style, both featuring fanged heads.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|pp=45-6}} Subsequent Andean cultures revived these ancient ceramics styles and imagery.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|p=47}}

[[Paracas culture]], from Peru's desert south coast, created highly detailed ceramics, that were often painted after firing. Paints, made with an [[acacia]] resin binder, were commonly warm yellow, olive green, red-orange, white, and black in color. Paracas artists built upon Chavín styles and introduced the [[double spout-and-bridge vessel]] and distinctive masks portraying a supernatural "Oculate Being," that combines human, owl, and double-headed snake forms.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|pp=48-51}}

[[Nasca culture]], another south coastal Peruvian culture, returned to the less fragile practice slip-painted their ceramics prior to firing. They created thirteen distinct colors, the larger palette found in Pre-Columbian ceramics in the Americas, which included rare pale purple, maroon, and bluish-grey. Nasca artists created ceremonial and utilitarian bowls and beakers, effigy jars, panpipes, and vessels of new designs, including the stepped-fret. These combined sculptural elements with surface painting, often with curvilinear designs emphasized by bold, black outlining. Painters used revolving turntables to paint all sides of a ceramic piece.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|pp=64-73}}

Dominating Peru's north coast from 1–600 CE, the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] culture excelled at the art of ceramics, which was characterized by symbolic, religious imagery. Moche artists produced some of the more [[naturalism (visual art)|naturalistic]], i.e. faithfully representational, artwork of the precolumbian Americas. [[Moche portrait vessel]] were so realistic that individuals portrayed at different stages of their life are identifiable. Their paintings on ceramics were narrative and action-packed. Ceramics produced by two-press molds were identical in shape but individualized through unique surface painting. Tens of thousands of Moche ceramics have survived today. The stirrup-spout vessel continued to be the most common form of clay vessel, but Moche artists also created bowls, dippers, jars with long necks, spout-and-handle vessels, and double-chambered vessels that whistled when liquid was poured. Vessels were often effigies portraying elaborate scenes. A fineline painting tradition emerged, which resembles Greek [[black-figure pottery]].{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|pp=82-6}} A 29,000-square-foot Moche ceramics workshop with numerous kilns was discovered in at the mountain Mayal in the [[Chicama Valley]]. The workshop specialized in female figurines.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|p=106}}

The [[Tiwanaku]] and [[Wari culture]]s shared dominance of the Andes, roughly from 500 to 1000 BCE. The Tiwanaku civilizations originated in [[Lake Titicaca]] region of [[Bolivia]], and a staff-bearing deity figured largely in their artwork.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|p=118}} Tiwanaku artists continued the tradition of naturalistic, ceramic portrait vessels.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|p=136}} The ubiquitous Wari ceramics carried over imagery from their [[Andean textiles|textiles]] and metalwork, such as [[llama]] and [[alpaca]] imagery. [[Qunchupata, Ayacucho|Qunchupata]] in Peru was the epicenter of Wari ceramic production, featuring pit kilns and firing rooms. The stone floors of the firing rooms had rounded depressions for accommodating larger pots. Some Wari palaces had their own attached kilns. Broken potsherds were used as forms for building new pots and for scrapers. Evidence shows ceramics were often ritually destroyed.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|pp=149-152}}

Four Andean civilizations flourished in Late Intermediate Period: the [[Chancay culture|Chancay]], [[Chimú culture|Chimú]], [[Lambayeque culture|Lambayeque]], and [[Ica culture|Ica]]. Luxury goods, including elaborate ceramics, were mass-produced in vast quantities for the middle class as well as nobles. Identical ceramics created in molds took sway over individualized works.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|pp=153-4}} The Lambayeque culture of north coastal Peru created press-molded reliefs on blackware ceramics.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|p=161}} Chimú ceramics, also predominantly blackware, often featured zoomorphic appliqués, such as monkeys or sea birds. They excelled at the doubled-chambered whistling vessels.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|p=174}} Chancay ceramics, from the central coast, featured black-on-white designs on unique shapes, such as female effigies or elongated, oval jars. Their sand-tempered ceramics were hastily painted and left unpolished.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|p=175}} Ica culture ceramics, from the southern coasts, were the finest quality of their time. They were still handcrafted and had a wide range of [[polychrome]] slips, including black, maroon, orange, purple, red, white, and a glittery deep purple. Designs were abstract and geometric.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|p=179}}

The [[Inca Empire]] or [[Tawantinsuyo]] spanned 3500 miles and controlled the world's largest empire by 1500 CE. Artistically, they unified regional styles. Incan ceramics were geometric and understated, while color schemes remained regionally diverse.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|p=180}} Mass-produced pottery, conformed to standardized measurements, such as the [[urpu]], a long-necked jar with handles and a pointed bottom used to transport [[maize]] and [[chicha]], maize beer.

[[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] ceramics fall into two major categories: ''na'e'', or dishes, and ''yapepó'', pots, pans, and storage containers. These were both utilitarian and ceremonial. The precontact ceramic tradition of the Gran Chaco was dramatically transformed under European colonization, which created a demand for pitchers, cups, and other introduced pottery forms. Author [[Josefina Pla]] observed that women are typically potters, and animals associated with men are not represented in Guaraní pottery.&lt;ref name=escobar&gt;Escobar, Ticio.

[[Tobatí]], a city near [[Asunción]], Paraguay, is renowned for its ceramics, including tiles and female effigy jars, known as ''Las gorgas.'' A reddish-brown slip, known as ''tapyta'' in [[Guarani language|Guaraní]], is popular, with blackware being less common.{{sfn|Davies|Fini|1995|p=127}} A local ceramic artist, Don [[Zenón Páez]] (b. 1927) became famous for his ceramic figures of saints.

[[Itá, Paraguay]] is another ceramic center, known for its whimsical, ceramic chickens.{{sfn|Davies|Fini|1995|p=143}} [[Rosa Brítez]] (b. 1941) is a famous ceramic artist from Itá and has been recognized by [[UNESCO]].

The [[Museo del Barro]], "Museum of Mud," in Asunción features pottery from the Gran Chaco, from Pre-Columbian Guaraní to contemporary [[mestizo]] ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canal5paravision.com/the-museo-del-barro-in-ansuncion-paraguay/ "The Museo del Barro In Ansuncion Paraguay."] ''Paraguay Travel Guide.''

The pottery tradition at [[Pedra Pintada]] in Brazil represents the oldest known ceramics in the Americas.{{sfn|Silverman|Isbell|2008|p=365}} Dating back to 5630 BCE, this same tradition continued for 2500 years. Ceramics from the [[Taperinha]] site near [[Santarém, Pará|Santarém]], Brazil date back to 5130 BCE and include sand-tempered bowls and cooking vessels resembling gourds. Other ancient Amazonian ceramic traditions, Mina and Uruá-Tucumã featured shell- and sand-tempered pottery, that was occasionally painted red.{{sfn|Silverman|Isbell|2008|p=207}} Around 1000 CE, dramatic new ceramic styles emerged throughout Amazonia. Amazonian ceramics are geometric and linear in decoration. Polychrome pottery typically features red and black on white slips. Additionally ceramics were decorated by sculpting, incision, excision, and grooving. In the upper and central Amazon, the bark of the [[caraipé]] tree, ''[[Licania octandra]]'', provided tempering material.{{sfn|Silverman|Isbell|2008|p=368}}

In regions of [[terra preta]], or "black earth", of the [[Amazon rainforest]], an abundance of potsherds were used to develop the soil and build [[mound]]s, which protected buildings and cemeteries from seasonal flooding.&lt;ref name=marajo&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:0GSZ_LJJjX4J:www.denverartmuseum.org/files/File/mm_marajo%2520info%2520sheet%25206-1-11%281%29.pdf+Amazonia+pottery+pubic+Brazil&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjzotgfDDix25KlXM1ERFKhzgkoZR-y5wBK5VRuCXDuKq5EJzbdMZtIJDI5ATKSD8hois_JNrPJLWnGRXhg8vCw-ID0YrjL-zVsnzQImp2Iwb9f6mWXha1Bij4kB1FBXskVk7LC&amp;sig=AHIEtbSxhBa1zr8DPT-1NXkzGBIDL6JVuQ "Marajó: Ancient Ceramics from the Mouth of the Amazon."] (retrieved 9 Nov 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marajó Island]], located at the mouth of the [[Amazon River]] was a major ceramic center, where the [[Marajoara Phase]] of polychrome ceramics last from around 400 to 1300 CE. In the central Amazon, the Mancapuru Phase, or Incised Rim Tradition, emerged in the 5th century CE.{{sfn|Silverman|Isbell|2008|p=366}} Marajoara ceramics, typically tempered with grog,{{sfn|Silverman|Isbell|2008|p=368}} were complex effigies of humans and animals, such as reptiles and birds.&lt;ref name=marajo/&gt; The dead were cremated and buried in elaborate ceramic urns. Ceramic artists are active in Marajó, using precontact styles for inspiration.

Women have traditionally been the ceramic artists in the Amazon. Female figures are common in anthropomorphic effigy vessels. [[Tanga (ceramic)|Tanga]]s are a unique Amazonian cultural item; they are triangular, concave ceramic pubic coverings held in place by strings, once worn by women of several Amazonian tribes. Today, they are still worn by girls during their puberty rites among [[Panoan languages|Panoan]]-speaking peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marajoara.com/gender.html "Archaeology."] ''Marajó''.

[[File:Concealed shoes from East Anglia.jpg|thumb|350px|Concealed shoes from [[East Anglia]]]]
'''Concealed shoes''' hidden in the fabric of a building have been discovered in many European countries, as well as in other parts of the world, since at least the [[early modern period]]. Independent researcher Brian Hoggard has observed that the locations in which these shoes are typically found&amp;nbsp;– in chimneys, under floors, above ceilings, around doors and windows, in the roof&amp;nbsp;– suggest that some may have been concealed as magical charms to protect the occupants of the building against evil influences such as [[demon]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, ghosts and witches. Others may have been intended to bestow fertility on a female member of the household, or been an offering to a [[household deity]].

Concealed shoes have been found in many types of building, including country houses, [[public house]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, a Benedictine monastery and a [[Baptists|Baptist]] church. The earliest yet reported was discovered behind the choirstalls in [[Winchester Cathedral]], which were installed in 1308.

[[Northampton Museum and Art Gallery|Northampton Museum]] maintains a Concealed Shoe Index, which by 2012 contained 1900 reports of discoveries, mostly from Britain and almost half from the 19th century. The overwhelming majority have been worn, and many have been repaired. Most finds are of single shoes, about half of them belonging to children.

The custom of concealing shoes in the structure of a building appears to have more or less died out some time during the 20th century.

==Background==
Since at least the [[early modern period]] it was a common custom to hide objects such as written charms, [[dried cat]]s, [[horse skulls]], and [[witch bottle]]s in the structure of a building,{{sfnp|Hoggard|2004|p=167|ps=none}} but concealed shoes are by far the most common items discovered.{{sfnp|Hoggard|2004|p=178|ps=none}} Archaeologist Brian Hoggard has observed that the locations in which these shoes are found suggest that at least some were concealed as magical charms to protect the occupants of the building against evil influences.{{sfnp|Hoggard|2004|p=167|ps=none}} Such hidden caches of objects are known by archaeologists as spiritual middens.{{r|TrappingWitches}}

[[Northampton Museum and Art Gallery|Northampton Museum]] maintains a Concealed Shoe Index,{{efn|[[Northampton]] was once a major shoemaking centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Boot and Shoe Quarter Conservation Area |url=http://www.northampton.gov.uk/info/200207/building-conservation-and-trees/1444/boot-and-shoe-quarter-conservation-area |publisher=Northampton Borough Council |accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} which by 1998 contained more than 1100 reports of concealed shoes, mostly from Britain but some from as far away as Canada.{{sfnp|Hoggard|2004|p=179|ps=none}} By 2012 it had increased to 1900 entries,{{r|NorthamptonMuseum}} of which almost half date from the 19th century.

The custom of concealing shoes in the fabric of a building appears to have more or less died out some time during the 20th century, although not entirely.{{sfnp|Hoggard|2004|p=179|ps=none}} The shoe manufacturer Norvic incorporated a pair of their women's high-leg boots in the foundations of their new factory built in 1964, and an even more recent account comes from [[Knebworth House]], where in 1991 an estate worker's shoe replaced an "old court shoe" that had been discovered behind some panelling.{{r|Swann}} Nevertheless, only 50 post-1900 instances of concealed shoes have been recorded.{{sfnp|Hoggard|2004|p=179|ps=none}}

==Location of finds==
Concealed shoes have been discovered in several European countries,{{r|NorthamptonMuseum}} as well as in North America{{sfnp|Manning|2012|p=ii|ps=none}} and Australia.{{r|BBCAustralia}} Although deposits have been found throughout the United States they are concentrated in [[New England]] and the northeastern United States, the latter of which was first colonised by immigrants from the East Anglia region of England.{{sfnp|Manning|2012|p=353|ps=none}}{{efn|There were relatively few witch trials and executions in England compared to other European countries, but East Anglia did experience one of the most intense witch hunts in the country, as for a time did New England.
{{sfnp|Manning|2012|p=353|ps=none}}}}

An analysis of the Concealed Shoe Index maintained by Northampton Museum, conducted by [[June Swann]] and published in 1996,{{r|Swann}} reveals that the most common place of concealment is the chimney, fireplace or hearth (26.2 per cent), followed by under the floor or above the ceiling (22.9 per cent), and almost as many concealed in the roof. Shoes have also been found around doors and windows, under the stairs, and among the foundations. Concealed shoes have been discovered in many types of building: country cottages, town houses, manor houses, hospitals, [[workhouse]]s, factories, [[public house]]s, and two Oxford colleges, [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's]] and [[The Queen's College, Oxford|Queen's]]. They have even been found in ecclesiastical buildings, including a [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monastery in Germany and a [[Baptists|Baptist]] church in [[Cheshire]], England.{{r|Swann}}

The earliest concealed shoe yet reported was discovered behind the choirstalls in [[Winchester Cathedral]], which were installed in 1308.{{r|Swann}}

==Characteristics==
Most of the concealed shoes found to date are made of leather, but wooden clogs and rubber [[galoshes]] have also been reported, among others. The overwhelming majority (almost 98 per cent) have been worn, and many show signs of repair. All ages are represented in the shoe sizes, from babies to adults, but there is little difference in the ratio of adult male to female shoes, at 21.5 per cent and 26.5 per cent respectively. Most finds are of single shoes, but some pairs have also been discovered.{{r|Swann}} About half of the shoes so far discovered belonged to children.{{r|Pitt}}

Apart from their significance to folklore, concealed shoes give an important insight into what ordinary people have historically worn on their feet.{{r|NorthamptonMuseum}}

==Explanations==
Several theories have been advanced to account for the incorporation of shoes into the fabric of a building, one of which is that they served as some kind of fertility charm. There is a long-standing connection between shoes and fertility, perhaps exemplified by the nursery rhyme, "[[There was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe]]", and the custom of casting a shoe after a bride as she leaves for her [[honeymoon]]{{sfnp|Opie|Opie|1997|pp=522–524|ps=none}} or attaching shoes to the departing couple's car.{{sfnp|Jack|2008|loc=There Was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe|ps=none}} Archaeologist [[Ralph Merrifield]] has observed that in the English county of [[Lancashire]] women who wished to conceive might try on the shoes of a woman who had just given birth,{{sfnp|Merrifield|1987|p=134|ps=none}} a custom known as smickling.{{r|Dixon-Smith}}
[[File:Old Woman who lived in a shoe-Kronheim.jpg|thumb|''Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe'', by [[Joseph Martin Kronheim]], c. 1875]]

Another theory, and the one favoured by most scholars, argues that shoes were concealed to protect against evil influences such as [[demon]]s, ghosts, witches, and [[familiar spirit|familiars]]. Witches were believed to be attracted by the human scent of a shoe, and after entering one found themselves trapped, as they are unable to reverse.{{r|TrappingWitches}} Merrifield has suggested that an unofficial 14th-century English saint, [[John Schorne]], may have been the source of the belief that shoes had the power to protect against evil. Schorne was said to have succeeded in trapping the [[Devil]] in a boot, a legend that may have its origin in a more ancient folk belief,{{sfnp|Hoggard|2004|p=179|ps=none}} which the Church was attempting to convert into an "approved Christian rite".{{sfnp|Manning|2012|pp=352–353}}

Archaeologist and architectural historian M. Chris Manning has proposed that the immurement of shoes, garments, and other objects may be related to the belief in a [[household deity]] or helpful spirit found throughout northern Europe from Ireland to western Russia.{{sfnp|Manning|2012|pp=350–351|ps=none}} According to Manning, Schorne's use of a shoe to capture or repel a troublesome spirit may have called upon an existing belief in the power of shoes and other garments to attract, repel, or "lay" such spirits. The [[brownie (folklore)|brownie]] and [[hob (folklore)|hob]], domestic [[fairy|fairies]] found in England and Scotland, could be driven off by a gift of clothing. In Russia, it was said that the [[domovoi]], a helpful domestic spirit, could be attracted to a home with an old boot or [[bast shoe]] placed under the stove or hung in the yard. The belief in household spirits is closely tied to the concept of the familiar, which in turn is linked to the belief in demons and other harmful spirits.

Thirteen of the shoes in Swann's analysis (only a small fraction of the thousands of concealed shoes reported worldwide) were buried in the foundations of a building. She has alluded to a possible connection with the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] practice of putting human babies in the foundations of their buildings, and suggested that the shoes may have acted as a substitute for the person.{{r|Swann}}

{{Refimprove|date=March 2013}}
'''Decalcomania''' (from the French ''décalcomanie'') is a decorative technique by which engravings and prints may be transferred to pottery or other materials. Today, the shortened version is "[[decal]]."

==Origins==
[[File:Decalcomania Advertisement by W. Atkinson &amp; Co.png|400px|thumb|Advertisement for the decalcomania process in the 1870 New York City directory.]]
Decalcomania was invented in England about 1750 and imported into the United States at least as early as 1865. Its invention has been attributed to [[Simon François Ravenet]], an engraver from France who later moved to England and perfected the process, which he called "''décalquer''" (derived from French ''papier de calque'', "tracing paper").{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} The first known use of the French term ''décalcomanie'', in [[Mary Elizabeth Braddon]]'s ''Eleanor's Victory'' (1863), was followed by the English ''decalcomania'' in an 1865 trade show catalog (''The Tenth Exhibition of the [[Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association]]''); it was popularized during the ceramic transfer craze of the mid-1870s. By ''c'' 1875 decalcomania designs printed in colored glazes were being applied to [[porcelain]], an extension of [[transfer-printing]], which had been developed in England since the late 18th century. The decalcomania was applied over an already-glazed surface and re-fired. The process began to be mechanized from the turn of the 20th century.

==Artists==
The [[Surrealist art|surrealist]] [[Oscar Domínguez]] referred to his work as "decalcomania with no preconceived object." He took up the technique in 1936, using [[gouache]] spread thinly on a sheet of paper or other surface (glass has been used), which is then pressed onto another surface such as a [[canvas]]. Dominguez used black gouache, though colours later made their appearance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

German artist [[Max Ernst]] also practised decalcomania, as did [[Hans Bellmer]] and [[Remedios Varo]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

French surrealist [[Yves Tanguy]] used the technique in his 1936 works, ''Paysage I'' and ''Paysage II'', which were included in the [[Guggenheim Museum]]'s exhibition, "Surrealism: Two Private Eyes" (4 June – 12 September 1999, New York).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.guggenheim.org/publication/surrealism-two-private-eyes |title=Surrealism: Two Private Eyes |date=6 August 1999 |website=Guggenheim  |access-date=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==
In the 1950s and early 1960s, [[King Features Syndicate]] marketed a set of decalcomanias bearing full-color pictures of characters from its [[comic strips]], including [[Flash Gordon]], [[the Katzenjammer Kids]], and [[Dagwood Bumstead]]. Intended for young children who might have difficulty pronouncing or reading the word "decalcomanias," these transfers were marketed as "Cockamamies," a deliberate mispronunciation. The term "cockamamy" or "cockamamie" has entered the English language with various slang meanings, usually denoting something that is wacky, strange or unusual. However, the expression "cockamamie" is attested by 1946, and reportedly as early as the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/cockamamie | title=Origin and meaning of cockamamie |website=Online Etymology Dictionary  |access-date=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fractals===
The production of decalcomanias has not been confined to art. At [[Yale University]] [[fingerpaint]] decalcomanias have been analysed for their tendency, when the process is repeated several times on the same paper, to generate [[fractal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://users.math.yale.edu/public_html/People/frame/Fractals/Panorama/Art/Decalcomania/Decalcomania.html |title=Fractal Geometry Panorama |website=Math, Yale University |access-date=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Devotional objects''' (also, '''devotional articles, devotional souvenirs, devotional artifacts''') are religious [[souvenir]]s (figurines, pictures, [[votive candle]]s, books, [[amulet]]s, and others), owned and carried by the faithful, who see them as imbued with spiritual values, and use them for [[votive offering]].&lt;ref name="Cini1961"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hourihane2012"/&gt; Production and sales of devotional articles have become a widespread industry in the vicinity of various religious sites all over the world.&lt;ref name="Cini1961"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Park2002"/&gt;

Devotional articles have a long history; in Christianity they have been mentioned in historical works such as those related to [[Paul the Apostle]]&lt;ref name="Schnabel2010"/&gt; and in older religions they have been traced as far back as the times of [[ancient Egypt]] and [[ancient Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref name="Hourihane2012"/&gt; International law defines "devotional articles" as including "the Bible, the [[Koran]], [[prayer book|prayer]] and [[Liturgical book|service books]], [[hymnal]]s, ritual articles, [[sacramental wine]], [[crucifix]]es and [[rosary|rosaries]]".&lt;ref name="FleckBothe2008"/&gt; Such items may be natural and hardly processed (such as earth from the [[Holy Land]]), but majority of modern devotional articles are mass-produced (strips of paper with prayers, pictures of holy figures, prayer books, etc.)&lt;ref name="Cini1961"/&gt; Such items are usually seen as having little artistic value, as their primary function is not decorative but spiritual.&lt;ref name="Cini1961"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hourihane2012"/&gt;

American sociologist [[Charles H. Lippy]] observed that such articles are "means of access to the [[supernatural]]", and are criticized by some as [[superstition]].&lt;ref name="Lippy1994-89"/&gt; Devotional articles owned by famous religious figures, such as [[Catholic Saints]], commonly become [[religious relics]].&lt;ref name="Sharot2001"/&gt; Widespread popularity of certain devotional articles has, throughout centuries, influenced the public popular image of certain religious symbols, such as [[angel]]s.&lt;ref name="MarshallWalsham2006"/&gt;

[[Image:Electronic-disturbance-theater.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Electronic Disturbance Theater 2.0, photo by Kinsee Morlan]]
The '''Electronic Disturbance Theater''' ('''EDT'''), established in 1997 by [[performance artist]] and writer [[Ricardo Dominguez (professor)|Ricardo Dominguez]], is an electronic company of cyber activists, critical theorists, and performance artists who engage in the development of both the theory and practice of non-violent acts of defiance across and between digital and non-digital spaces. [[Ricardo Dominguez (professor)|Ricardo Dominguez]], Brett Stalbaum, Stefan Wray, and Carmin Karasic collectively form EDT.  Taking the idea of the American [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1960s, the EDT members have always used their real names.  As a collective group they organize and program [[computer software]] to show their views against anti-propagandist and [[military]] actions, and begin mobilizing micronetworks to act in solidarity by staging [[virtual sit-ins]] online and allowing the emergence of a collective presence in direct digital actions.

==Background==
The EDT created a program called [[FloodNet]] to allow [[electronic civil disobedience]] (ECD). This was a form of [[hacktivism]] which would help create the simulation of a [[sit-in]] protest over the [[Internet]] simply known as a [[virtual sit-in]] demonstration to disrupt Zapatista oppressors' websites, by overloading their [[computer networks]] and [[Server (computing)|servers]].  The Electronic Disturbance Theater group believe that the Internet should not be used purely as a means for [[communication]] and [[data exchange]]; it is also a forum for direct action.

==Electronic Disturbance Theater 2.0==
Current active members of the Electronic Disturbance Theater, who refer to themselves as Electronic Disturbance Theater 2.0,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.digicult.it/it/digimag/issue-062/no-borders-struggles-the-electronic-disturbance-theatre-2-0/ |title=Lotte senza confini. l'electronic disturbance theatre 2.0 |trans-title=Struggle Without Borders: The Electronic Disturbance Theater 2.0 |publisher=Digimag |number=62 |first=Micha |last=Cardenas |language=Italian |date=March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; include Brett Stalbaum, Amy Sara Carroll, [[Elle Mehrmand]], [[Micha Cárdenas]], and [[Ricardo Dominguez (professor)]]. 

The group has received a storm of media attention for their 2007 project, the ''Transborder Immigrant Tool'' (TBT), which sends experimental poetry to users in addition to helping them find water and safe routes when crossing the [[Mexican American border|Mexican-American border]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arte-util.org/projects/transborder-immigrant-tool/|title=Arte Útil  / Transborder Immigrant Tool|website=www.arte-util.org|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; EDT have described this project as the next step of electronic civil disobedience, or ECD 2.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdcitybeat.com/sandiego/article-8159-after-the-storm.html |title=After the Storm |publisher=San Diego CityBeat |first=Kinsee |last=Morlan |date=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Transborder Immigrant Tool was shown in numerous museums and galleries in 2010, including the California Biennial at the [[Orange County Museum of Art]], the [[Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego]], and the [[Galería de la Raza]] in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocma.net/index.html?page=past&amp;show=exhibit&amp;e_id=3126 |title=2010 California Biennial |publisher=Orange County Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcasd.org/press/artists-announced-here-not-there-san-diego-art-now-exhibition-–-opens-june-6-2010-museum-conte |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120804112913/http://www.mcasd.org/press/artists-announced-here-not-there-san-diego-art-now-exhibition-%E2%80%93-opens-june-6-2010-museum-conte |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 4, 2012 |title=Artists announced for Here not there: San Diego art now exhibition – opens june 6, 2010, at Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego in La Jolla |publisher=Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego |date=April 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.galeriadelaraza.org/eng/events/index.php?op=view&amp;id=2418 |title=Transborder Immigrant Tool |publisher=Galeria de la Raza}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is maintained by [[California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Electronic Disturbance Theater is currently under investigation for their [[virtual sit-in]] in support of the 2010 March 4 strikes and occupations in support of public education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/04/09/virtual_protest_as_ddos/ |title='Virtual sit-in' tests line between DDoS and free speech |publisher=The Register |first=Dan |last=Goodin |date=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==FloodNet==
[[File:Screenshot_of_Electronic_Disturbance_Theater_Floodnet_from_September_9th_1998.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Floodnet software, September 9th, 1998]]
The group's objective was, with the use of [[digital media]] and internet based [[technology]], to demonstrate [[nonviolent resistance]] in support of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] rebels residing in the state of [[Chiapas]] in [[Mexico]]. EDT uses both [[e-mail]] and the Internet to promote their work around the world, encouraging fellow supporters to [[download]] and run a tool based on [[HTML]] (Hyper Text Makeup Language) and [[Java applet]] (an internet program used to help support interactive web-based features or programs that a HTML cannot provide alone) called FloodNet.  FloodNet is a computer-based program, created by members of the Electronic Disturbance theater company [http://www.carminka.net/ Carmin Karasic] and Brett Stalbaum.&lt;ref name="Forbes_Floodnet"/&gt;

The FloodNet program would simply reload a [[URL]] for short several times, effectively slowing the [[website]] and [[network server]] down (a [[DDOS attack]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yourdictionary.com/floodnet&lt;/ref&gt; if a high number of [[protest]]ers were to join in the [[sit-in]] at one time. The EDT would first execute the FloodNet [[software]] in what would be for them a [[dress rehearsal]] before attacking their main targets on April 10, 1998, and a month later, on both Mexican and American government websites, representing both the Mexican President [[Ernesto Zedillo]] and American President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref name="Wired_Floodnet" /&gt;

FloodNet would work on this basic idea taken from street theater practices and political rallies and protest, but instead present it on a much larger and international stage, with the facilitation of macro-networks and non-digital forms of action.

The EDT's mission was to allow the voices of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation to be heard, after the attack on the small remote village of [[Acteal]] in Chiapas, Mexico. The [[Paramilitary]], a government-funded military squad, surrounded a [[Catholic church]] during a Tsotsil Mayan (a spoken Mexican language from around the Chiapas area of Mexico). For the next several hours the Paramilitary shot everyone to death, those inside the church and any who tried to escape, resulting in the death of fifteen children, nine men, and twenty-one women, four of whom were pregnant, on December 22, 1997. This event became known as the [[Acteal Massacre]]. Those who were convicted of this crime were later released in the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] to the outrage of many, after ignoring eyewitness reports and allowing those who confessed to this crime on humanity. Instead, the Supreme Court focused on the mismanagement of the investigation and the fabrication of evidence.

The Electronic Disturbance Theater took notice of these actions when others did not and arranged their first act of electronic civil disobedience against the [[Mexican Government]]. In a subsequent version of FloodNet, those who had [[download]]ed the FloodNet [[Computer program|program]] in support of the Zapatistas were asked to repeatedly input the names of those that had lost their lives at the hands of the Mexican Army in military attacks.  This would then target the [[Server (computing)|servers]] to return an error message each time these URLs would be requested.  This data request would be stored in a [[server log|server's error log]] and in the eyes of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation and the Electronic Disturbance Theater group, a symbolic list of those 45 Acteal civilians who had died straight to their [[murder]]ers.  If enough people used the FloodNet [[applet]], this would cause the computer server running the website to overload, so that when a regular visitor or someone working within the site tried to access the website or send company based [[email]]s and files, the pages would either load extremely slowly or not at all.  This worked on the same basis of a real sit-in demonstration, where the [[protester]]s block the entrance to a public building of their oppressors and preventing access to the building.

With around 25% of the world's population in one way or another connected to the [[World Wide Web]], with the use of dial-up internet connection, wired or wireless internet [[broadband]] connection and even [[mobile internet]] technology, every one of these means of [[communication]] can allow the internet to be used as a means of non-violent action within [[human rights]], and is viewable around the world, and can be translated into different languages but most importantly not controlled by the [[government]].  The EDT networked performances have already opened access and communication between three unlikely micro-networks: [[net.art]], net.activism, and net.hackers. With technology always evolving there is no telling how these areas will grow.

However, on June 10, 1998, the EDT struck the Mexican Secretaria de Gobernacion (Secretary of Government), which is involved in [[immigration policies]] as well as Mexico's federal public security forces working in conjunction with the [[military]] Zapatista communities in Chiapas unsuccessfully.  The Mexican government would have a [[program (machine)|program]]med [[countermeasure]] in place. This is what the EDT believe took place.  A countermeasure built into the operating [[JavaScript]] was placed in the [[Secretaria de Gobernacion]]'s website that was designed to activate whenever FloodNet was directed toward its servers.  Upon activation, the website would open window after window on the FloodNet user's [[Internet browser]]. If the FloodNet user remained connected long enough, their browser, whether it is [[Netscape]] or [[Internet Explorer]], could crash the activist's computer, forcing the activist to reboot their system and stopping the FloodNet program at the source.  The EDT has since dealt with both the Mexican government both online and offline and the [[United States Department of Defense]], which has now inserted a [[counter attack]] system into their internet browser-based coding to prevent any more FloodNet-based attacks to the system and server.

The FloodNet system was used again against the [[World Trade Organization]] in 1999, where the group would release their online civil disobedience software to the public under the name "Disturbance Development's Kit".

The Electronic Disturbance Theater has been, and is likely to remain, a heated topic of debate within its areas of activity such as: [[political]] up rise, civil disobedience, [[hacktivism]], and acts which cave been called [[cyber terrorism]].  The FloodNet program enables protesters to voice their grievances in a non-violent sit-in style, without having to attend protests and rallies in person. Additionally FloodNet incorporated Usernames which allowed protesters to be protected from potential retaliation, as their real names did not have to be used. There are those who have criticized that FloodNet constitutes an inappropriate use of [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] which impinges upon the right of those affected to use the internet which those same detractors claim should be free for anyone to use despite [[political views]]. A particular example of FloodNet detractors is [[The Virtual Republic]], their representatives view EDT's blockage of both [[communications]] and [[data]] as an act of cyber terrorism.  [[The Virtual Republic]] believes the system should be open for all internet users, and should be accessible with a simple point-and-click, furthermore it is their opinion that those individuals or groups which might impede the free access to internet resources should be [[banned]].  Protesters are asked to [[protest]] outside of their oppressors' physical location by means which will not affect the business conducted within. Representatives of The Virtual Republic have further opined that actions of the EDT are nothing more than [[agit-prop]] and act only to block data in the struggle for the development of [[democracy]] and human rights.

===Writing career===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2013}}
Elizabeth Amber wrote this series of erotic historical paranormal romance novels based on her interest in Greco-Roman artifacts celebrating the grape harvest. Satyrs are the carnal followers of the wine god, Bacchus in ancient Roman mythology, and are depicted on many urns and amphorae found in Roman ruins.

In her novels, three half-satyr, half-human brothers own a lavish estate and vineyard in 1800s [[Tuscany]], Italy, where they guard ancient secrets and conduct unusual rituals.  When a letter arrives instructing them to seek out three endangered half-faerie brides, they see it as an opportunity to sire heirs.  She wrote her first book, ''Nicholas'',  and then went to a [[Romance Writers of America]] conference to learn where to submit her book. [[Kensington]] bought the series. ''Nicholas'' has been critically acclaimed by many reviewers and has been mentioned in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''.

[[Image:D'albert2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Eugen d'Albert in 1904]]
'''Eugen''' (originally '''Eugène''') '''Francois Charles d'Albert''' (10 April 1864{{spaced ndash}}3 March 1932) was a Scottish-born German pianist and composer.

Educated in Britain, d'Albert showed early musical talent and, at the age of seventeen, he won a scholarship to study in Austria. Feeling a kinship with German culture and music, he soon emigrated to Germany, where he studied with [[Franz Liszt]] and began a career as a concert pianist. D'Albert repudiated his early training and upbringing in Scotland and considered himself German.

While pursuing his career as a pianist, d'Albert focused increasingly on composing, producing [[List of operas by Eugen d'Albert|21 operas]] and a considerable output of piano, vocal, chamber and orchestral works. His most successful opera was ''[[Tiefland (opera)|Tiefland]]'', which premiered in Prague in 1903. His successful orchestral works included his cello concerto (1899), a symphony, two string quartets and two piano concertos. In 1907, d'Albert became the director of the [[Berlin University of the Arts|Hochschule für Musik]] in Berlin, where he exerted a wide influence on musical education in Germany. He also held the post of [[Kapellmeister]] to the Court of Weimar.

D'Albert was married six times, including to the pianist-singer [[Teresa Carreño]], and was successively a British, German and Swiss citizen.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
[[Image:Eugen dalbert age 20.jpg|thumb|left|upright|d'Albert aged 20]]
D'Albert was born at 4 Crescent Place,&lt;ref&gt;The nearby address of 9 Newton Terrace has been widely copied in the literature and on the web, but 4 Crescent Place is given in the statutory register of births (Gen. Reg. Office Scotland ref 644/08 0715) and in the notice of Eugène's birth in the Glasgow Herald of 12 May 1864.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glasgow]], Scotland, to an English mother, Annie Rowell, and a German-born father of French and Italian descent, Charles Louis Napoléon d'Albert (1809–1886), whose ancestors included the composers [[Giuseppe Matteo Alberti]] and [[Domenico Alberti]].&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;Williamson, John. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/00434 "Albert, Eugen d'"], Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 13 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; D'Albert's father was a pianist, arranger and a prolific composer of salon music&lt;ref&gt;See works by Charles d'Albert at imslp.org: http://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Albert,_Charles_d'&lt;/ref&gt; who had been ballet-master at the [[Her Majesty's Theatre|King's Theatre]] and at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;Sands, John. [http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/articles/arrangements/dance_music.html "Dance Arrangements from the Savoy Operas"]. ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', 4 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE=4150 Dance arrangements by Charles d'Albert of numerous [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] pieces]&lt;/ref&gt; D'Albert was born when his father was 55 years old. ''The Musical Times'' wrote in 1904 that "This, and other circumstances, accounted for a certain loneliness in the boy's home-life and the years of his childhood. He was misunderstood, and 'cribbed, cabined, and confined' to such an extent as to largely prejudice him against the country which gave him birth".&lt;ref name=MT&gt;''The Musical Times'', vol. 45, no. 741, 1 November 1904, pp. 697–700&lt;/ref&gt;

D'Albert was brought up in Glasgow and taught music by his father until he won a scholarship to the new National Training School for Music (forerunner of the [[Royal College of Music]]) in London, which he entered in 1876 at the age of 12.&lt;ref name=MT/&gt; D'Albert studied at the National Training School with [[Ernst Pauer]], [[Ebenezer Prout]], [[John Stainer]] and [[Arthur Sullivan]]. By the age of 14, he was winning public praise from ''[[The Times]]'' as "a bravura player of no mean order" in a concert in October 1878. He played [[Piano Concerto (Schumann)|Schumann's Piano Concerto]] at the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] in 1880, receiving more encouragement from ''The Times'': "A finer rendering of the work has seldom been heard."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' 17 October 1878, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 8 February 1881, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1880, d'Albert arranged the piano reduction for the vocal score of Sullivan's sacred music drama ''[[The Martyr of Antioch]]'', to accompany the chorus in rehearsal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/other_sullivan/martyr/conductor.html Information about ''The Martyr of Antioch''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905080640/http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/other_sullivan/martyr/conductor.html |date=5 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also credited with writing, under Sullivan's direction, the overture to [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s 1881 opera, ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Biographer Michael Ainger wrote that on the evening of 21 April 1881, "Sullivan gave his sketch of the overture to Eugene d'Albert to score. D'Albert was a seventeen-year-old student ... and winner of the Mendelssohn Scholarship that year" (Ainger, p. 195). [[David Russell Hulme]] studied the handwriting in the manuscript score of ''Patience'' and confirmed that it is that of Eugene, not of his father Charles (as had erroneously been reported by biographer [[Arthur Jacobs]]), both of whose script Hulme sampled. (Hulme, David Russell, Doctoral Thesis ''The Operettas of Sir Arthur Sullivan: a study of available autograph full scores'', 1985, [[University of Wales]], pp. 242–43. The Thesis is available from academic libraries including The British Library Document Supply Centre, Boston Spa, Wetherby W. Yorks, Ref # DX171353, and [[Northern Illinois University]], Call# :ML410.S95 H841986B)&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, d'Albert dismissed his training and work during this period as worthless.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Mark and Allan Evans [http://www.arbiterrecords.com/notes/147notes.html Extensive notes on d'Albert], Arbiter of Cultural Traditions website (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Times'' wrote that he "was born and educated in England, and won his earliest successes in England, although, in a freak of boyish impetuosity, he repudiated some years ago all connexion with this country, where, according to his own account, he was born by mere accident and where he learnt nothing."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 25 May 1886, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, however, he modified his views: "The former prejudice which I had against England, which several incidents aroused, has completely vanished since many years."&lt;ref name=MT/&gt;

In 1881, [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]] invited d'Albert to play his first piano concerto, which was "received with enthusiasm".&lt;ref name=MT/&gt; This seems to have been d'Albert's lost concerto in A major, not the work published three years later as his Piano Concerto No. 1 in B minor, Op. 2.&lt;ref&gt;Eastick, Martin.

[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40935 "D'Albert, Eugen Francis Charles (1864–1932)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 11 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eugen und Hermine d'Albert.jpg|thumb|left|d'Albert and Hermine Finck in 1902]]
In Germany and Austria, d'Albert built a career as a pianist. Liszt called him "the second [[Carl Tausig|Tausig]]", and d'Albert can be heard in an early recording of Liszt works. He played his own piano concerto with the [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra]] in 1882, the youngest pianist who had appeared with the orchestra.&lt;ref name=MT/&gt; D'Albert toured extensively, including in the United States from 1904 to 1905. His virtuoso technique was compared to that of [[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Musical Times'', vol. 102, no. 1422 (August 1961), pp. 489–90: [[Artur Schnabel]] said that if Busoni and d'Albert had been combined in one, the result would have been one of the greatest musicians of all times, "for d'Albert had all the raw material and Busoni all the refinement."&lt;/ref&gt; He was praised for his playing of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]]'s preludes and fugues and of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s sonatas.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; "As an exponent of Beethoven, Eugen d'Albert has few, if any, equals."&lt;ref name=MT/&gt; Gradually, d'Albert's work as a composer occupied his time more and more, and he reduced his concert playing.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He was the recipient of a number of dedications, most notably of [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Burleske|Burleske in D minor]]'', which he premiered in 1890.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;&lt;ref name=ODM/&gt;

D'Albert was a prolific composer. His output includes a large volume of successful piano and chamber music and [[lieder]]. He also composed twenty-one operas, in a wide variety of styles, which premiered mostly in Germany.  His first, ''Der Rubin'' (1893) was an oriental fantasy; ''[[Die Abreise]]'' (1898), which established him as an opera composer in Germany, was a one-act domestic comedy; ''Kain'' (1900) was a setting of the biblical story; and one of his last operas, ''[[Der Golem (opera)|Der Golem]]'', was on a traditional Jewish theme.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;''The Times'' obituary, 4 March 1932, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; His most successful opera was his seventh, ''[[Tiefland (opera)|Tiefland]]'', which premiered in Prague in 1903. When [[Thomas Beecham]] introduced the opera to London, ''The Times''  observed, "the scoring owes more than a little to the discipline of Sullivan; there is also a curiously English fragrance".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 1 October 1910, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tiefland'' played in opera houses throughout the world and has retained a place in the standard German and Austrian repertoire, with a production at the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]], in November 2007. According to biographer Hugh Macdonald, it "provides a link between Italian verismo and German expressionist opera, although the orchestral textures recall a more Wagnerian language."&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Another stage success was a comic opera called ''[[Flauto solo]]'' in 1905. D'Albert's most successful orchestral works included his cello concerto (1899), a symphony, two string quartets and two piano concertos. "Though not a composer of profound originality ... he had an unfailing sense of dramatic appropriateness and all the resources of a symphonic technique to give it expression and was thus able to achieve success in so many styles".&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

D'Albert edited critical editions of the scores of Beethoven and Bach, transcribed Bach's organ works for the piano and wrote cadenzas for Beethoven's piano concertos. In 1907, he succeeded [[Joseph Joachim]] as director of the [[Berlin University of the Arts|Hochschule für Musik]] in Berlin, in which capacity he had a wide influence on musical education in Germany. He also held the post of [[Kapellmeister]] to the Court of Weimar.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

===Personal life and death===
[[Image:GrabAlbert.jpg|thumb|Grave of d'Albert at the cemetery of [[Morcote]]]]
D'Albert's friends included [[Richard Strauss]], [[Hans Pfitzner]], [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]], [[Ignatz Waghalter]] and [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], the dramatist. He was married six times and had eight children. The first wife was Louise Salingré. The second, from 1892 to 1895, was the Venezuelan pianist, singer and composer [[Teresa Carreño]], herself much married and considerably older than d'Albert. D'Albert and Carreño were the subject of a famous joke: "Come quick! Your children and my children are quarrelling again with our children!"&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g., {{cite book|last=Walker|first=Alan|authorlink=Alan Walker (musicologist)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWL6fBaKHzcC&amp;pg=RA1-PA422&amp;lpg=RA1-PA422&amp;dq=%22your+children+and+my+children+are%22+%22our+children%22+albert&amp;source=web&amp;ots=kaWOBH-2Gb&amp;sig=eihZNEBNJEMnim9LnJszrH0-fsM |title=Franz Liszt: The final years, 1861–1886|isbn=0-8014-8453-7|pages=423, footnote 14|year=1997|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line, however, has also been attributed to others. His later wives were [[mezzo-soprano]] Hermine Finck, who originated the role of the witch in Humperdinck's ''[[Hansel and Gretel (opera)|Hansel and Gretel]]''; actress Ida Fulda; Friederike ("Fritzi") Jauner; and Hilde Fels. His last companion was a mistress, Virginia Zanetti.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

In 1914, d'Albert moved to [[Zurich]] and became a Swiss citizen. He died in 1932 at the age of 67 in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]], where he had travelled for a divorce from his sixth wife. In the weeks preceding his death, d'Albert was the subject of attacks by the press in Riga concerning his personal life.&lt;ref&gt;Waghalter, Ignatz. ''Aus dem Ghetto in der Freiheit'' (Marienbad, Czechoslovakia, 1936)&lt;/ref&gt; D'Albert was buried in the cemetery overlooking [[Lake Lugano]] in [[Morcote]], Switzerland.

==Recordings==
As pianist, d'Albert did not record extensively, although his recordings represent a wide range of music. They include his own Scherzo, Op. 16; Capriolen, Op. 32; Suite, Op. 1, Gavotte and Minuet; and piano arrangements from his opera ''Die Toten Augen''. He made several [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] recordings, including the Piano Sonatas Nos. 18 and 21 ([[Piano Sonata No. 21 (Beethoven)|"Waldstein"]]), and the [[Violin Sonata No. 5 (Beethoven)|"Spring" Sonata]] for violin and piano (with Andreas Weissgerber). A selection of [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]] pieces were recorded in the 1910s and 1920s, with [[Études (Chopin)|études]], [[Polonaises (Chopin)|polonaises]] and [[Waltzes (Chopin)|waltzes]] represented. Perhaps surprisingly, his teacher [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] is not strongly represented among d'Albert's recordings, though he committed "Au bord d'une source" from ''[[Années de pèlerinage]]'' (1st year) to disc in 1916. [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]] also feature in his discography.&lt;ref name=discography&gt;Arnest, Mark. [http://home.earthlink.net/~marnest/discdalb.html "Eugene d'Albert: Discography",] (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FlatWorld'''  is a [[publisher]] of college-level [[textbooks]] and educational supplements&lt;ref&gt;Lim, Ronald S. [http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/279963/the-world-flat-even-publishing "The World is Flat – Even in Publishing."] ''[[Manila Bulletin]].'' October 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 2007 as Flat World Knowledge by Eric Frank and Jeff Shelstad.&lt;ref&gt;Lener, Edward and Cy Dillon. [http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/VALib/v56_n1/pdf/v56n1.pdf "Building a Better Model: Eric Frank on Flat World Knowledge."] ''Virginia Libraries.'' Jan–Feb–Mar 2010, pp. 5–9.&lt;/ref&gt; It was acquired at the end of 2016 by Alastair Adam and John Eielson and its company headquarters was moved from Washington, DC to Boston, MA.  The company originally offered every textbook published free using online delivery under the [[open content]] paradigm,&lt;ref&gt;Flat World Knowledge [http://www.flatworldknowledge.com/ Homepage] with company story.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Chin. [http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/insideBusop.htm?f=2010/september/28/chinwong.isx&amp;d=2010/september/28 "Textbooks for free."] ''[[Manila Standard Today]].'' September 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; but in November 2012, the company announced that it will no longer offer a free version citing financial concerns as the reason for the change.&lt;ref name=Chron_drop&gt;{{cite web |last=Howard |first=Jennifer |title=Flat World Knowledge to Drop Free Access to Textbooks |url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/flat-world-knowledge-to-drop-free-access-to-textbooks/40780 |work=Chronicle of Higher Education |publisher=Chronicle of Higher Education |accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2016 acquisition, the company rebranded as FlatWorld.  FlatWorld publishes more than 100 peer-reviewed textbooks.

==Company history==

===2007===
Flat World Knowledge was founded in 2007 by Jeff Shelstad and Eric Frank in [[Nyack, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, Mason A. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1588144_code209269.pdf?abstractid=1588144&amp;mirid=1 "Flat World Knowledge: Creating a Global Revolution in College Textbooks!"] Social Science Research Network. Case abstract available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1588144.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008===
Flat World Knowledge began [[alpha testing]] of their platform and business model spring of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Haiken, Melanie. [http://money.cnn.com/2008/12/02/smallbusiness/online_textbooks.fsb/index.htm "Save Cash – Download Your Textbooks An Online Startup Plans to Disrupt the Staid World of Textbook Publishing."] ''Fortune Small Business.'' December 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Two alpha phases involved faculty and one alpha phase involved students. The company then moved to small-scale private [[beta testing]] in 27 classes.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Chris. [https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2008/09/open-source-tex/ "Open Source Textbooks Challenge a Paradigm."] Wired.com. September 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on results from these studies, the business model was determined viable and the company moved toward preparing for a public beta launch in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, John Levi III, and David A. Wiley. [http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2800/2578 "A Sustainable Future for Open Textbooks?"] The Flat World Knowledge Story. ''First Monday.'' Vol 15, No 8. August 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009===
During spring of 2009, 30 colleges adopted Flat World open textbooks in public beta bringing the company their first 1,000 users. Eight textbooks were published at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Abell, John C. [https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/08/open-source-textbook-company-now-bmoc-at-400-colleges/ "Open Source Textbook Company Now BMOC at 400 Colleges."] Wired.com. August 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; By August 2009, Flat World textbooks had been adopted at 400 colleges for use by 40,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;Oshiro, Dana.

The company also published a graphic novel, ''[[Atlas Black: Managing to Succeed]]'' in August.

===2010===
Flat World Knowledge moved from Nyack, New York to [[Irvington, New York]] to accommodate company growth.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, Marc. [http://rivertowns.patch.com/articles/irvington-publishers-shaking-up-the-textbook-industry "Irvington Publishers Shaking Up the Textbook Industry."] ''Rivertowns Patch.'' October 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flat World Knowledge entered into a unique licensing agreement with Virginia State University in 2010. For eight core business courses, students gained access to all electronic formats of select textbooks including study aids. Unlike traditional licensing models, students retain access to course materials and study aids indefinitely through their Flat World student account. Audio textbook versions and [[ePub]] files similarly do not expire. The price for this universal digital access license is cited as $20 per student by the ''Richmond Times-Dispatch''.&lt;ref&gt;Llovio, Luis. [http://www2.timesdispatch.com/business/business/2010/aug/31/b-text31-ar-480382/ "Students in Eight Core Business Classes at VSU get Free Digital Access to Texts."] ''Richmond Times-Dispatch.'' August 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Virginia State University program is featured in the ''BizEd'' article "Digital at the Core." Virginia State University is using the agreement as part of a university effort to "save money, save the environment, improve student retention, and prepare business graduates for the complex working world."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Mirta M. [http://www.aacsb.edu/publications/Archives/NovDec10/40-43%20F-Digital%20at%20Core.pdf "Digital at the Core."] ''BizEd'' 9, no. 6 November 2010 pp. 40–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2010, the number of colleges and universities using Flat World open textbooks doubled to 800 higher education institutions. Student users more than tripled with 150,000 students using 24 published titles.

During fall semester 2010, 50 additional titles were announced as in the publication pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;Biba, Paul.

August 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 2010 also marked crossing the threshold of having 100 authors signed to write open textbooks for publication by Flat World Knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Mary. [http://assett.colorado.edu/post/1284 "Open Textbooks Offer Instructors More Control, Customizability."] ''ASSETT.'' September 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

August 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, Outsell Inc. named Flat World Knowledge as one of "30 to Watch" for 2011 among innovators and disruptors who were selected for "shaking up their respective marketplaces."&lt;ref&gt;Stratigos, Anthea, Leigh Watson Healy, and Marc Strohlein.

Flat World Knowledge. January 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 - 2015===

In November 2012, FlatWorld  announced that it will no longer provide free access to their textbook content citing financial concerns as the reason for this change.&lt;ref name="Chron_drop" /&gt; Unable to continue to operate without a way to generate greater revenue, it instituted a paywall and moved away from the open model.   Over the next three years, the company pivoted focus, investing in developing a new, competency-based learning platform and line of business.

===2016===
In late 2016, the core textbook publishing business, Flat World Knowledge, was spun off and acquired by Alastair Adam and John Eielson and rebranded as FlatWorld. The remaining competency-based learning business was rebranded as Sagence Learning.  Adam and Eielson saw an opportunity to disrupt the higher-education publishing market, where fewer and fewer students were able to afford a new textbook and were increasingly reliant on used, rented or outdated editions of titles. They wanted to refocus FlatWorld on low-cost, high-quality textbooks, available in whatever format the student preferred. They believed that by offering high-quality textbooks at affordable prices, they could put a new, current edition textbook in every student’s hands on the first day of class.

===Investments===
Flat World Knowledge secured $11.5 million in investments through 2010, including an initial $700k angel investment.&lt;ref&gt;Business Headlines.

===International===

In December 2010, the [[American Library Association]]'s Business Reference Sources Committee of RUSA's Business Reference and Services Section (BRASS) selected Flat World Knowledge's Business and Economics [[open textbooks]] for their 2010 list of "outstanding business reference sources."&lt;ref&gt;BRASS Business Reference Sources Committee, [[American Library Association]].

==Accessibility and regulatory issues==

===Accessibility===
Flat World Knowledge textbooks are developed for [[accessible publishing]] natively to facilitate compliance with expectations placed on educators for assuring student accessibility to course materials set forth in [[Section 504]] of the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]] and Title II of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA). For students with text, vision, vision and hearing, or physical disabilities, Flat World Knowledge has partnered with Bookshare to provide no-charge accessible digital books including an electronic [[Braille]] format. Bookshare members with qualifying disabilities have immediate access to course and reference materials online as opposed to having to request materials direct from the publisher by mail or through another intermediary. According to [[Jim Fruchterman]], CEO of [[Benetech]], the non-profit organization that operates Bookshare, "Without the cooperation of a publisher such as Flat World, students often wait for weeks to get textbooks in accessible formats and, in some cases, are forced to drop courses&lt;ref&gt;Kerscher, George, and Jim Fruchterman. [http://data.daisy.org/publications/docs/soundproof/sound_proof_book.html?q=publications/docs/soundproof/sound_proof_book.html "The Soundproof Book:] Exploration of Rights conflict and Access to Commercial EBooks for People with Disabilities." [[DAISY]] Consortium. Accessed January 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; due to lack of accessible books. Flat World is the first postsecondary textbook publisher to recognize and alleviate this problem."&lt;ref&gt;Bookshare.

December 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Price disclosure and edition availability===
Flat World Knowledge claims to make compliance with the recent Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) simple as the basic price for their textbooks is free and once published, any edition number remains available online at no charge or available for order in print by students, educators, and bookstores on-demand; educators change versions only when they wish and book versions are never "out of print."&lt;ref&gt;Edu1world.org. [http://www.edu1world.org/index/pages/page/?pgid=85 "Flat World Knowledge Makes HEOA Compliance Quick and Easy."] ''The Week in Review.'' May 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zinshteyn, Mikhail.

==Sustainability==
Digital textbook and course material formats offer [[sustainability]] advantages over traditional paper textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Bryce.

"Carbon Footprint of the Knowledge Sector: What's the Future?." ''Journal of Documentation'' 66, no. 6 December 2010 pp. 934-946.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a publishing industry study, an estimated "net [carbon] emission of 8.85 pounds per book [is created for each paper book] sold to consumers."&lt;ref name="publishersweekly"&gt;Milliot, Jim [http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20080310/15955-toward-a-greener-future-.html "Toward a Greener Future.

Local [[print on demand]] of licensed content offers environmental benefits by saving the need to produce, store, and ship books from a central location — saving energy, natural resources, and cost. Eliminating the need for shipping alone eliminates at least 12.7% of the carbon footprint for paper books.&lt;ref name="publishersweekly" /&gt;

Some students use accessible and audio formats. Though [[Braille embosser]]s print on paper, it is essential to provide access to educational materials in the format of choice to students regardless of disability. The same electronic file that is provided for a Braille embosser by Bookshare for Flat World Knowledge open textbooks is also compatible with many [[refreshable Braille display]]s.

Other accessible and audio mp3 formats are very [[sustainable]] as they are electronic.

==Formats==

===Free===
Until November 2012,&lt;ref name="Chron_drop"/&gt; Flat World open textbooks were available to read for free through the Flat World Knowledge website in an e-reader like format. Any user with access to the Internet was able to read the entire textbook catalog for free. This option has since been eliminated because too many students were taking advantage of this option and the FWK business model was becoming unsustainable without increased revenue from the other options.

[[Accessible]] formats of published works for people with qualifying disabilities are available at no charge through [[Bookshare]].

===Paid===
Textbooks in formats including print, individual PDF chapters, ePub, .MOBI (Kindle), audio mp3, abridged audio study mp3, and optional study tools are available for purchase by students direct, through bookstores,&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Calvin.

April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and via select online providers.

For users that desire note taking, highlighting, flash cards, or access to a condensed study view of textbooks through their online account, a paid study pass purchase is required.

==Derivative works==
Derivative works created through the Flat World publishing engine are available online at no charge in the two formats described earlier or for purchase in print format direct or through bookstores by [[ISBN]]. An ISBN is generated for all derivative work publications developed through the Flat World Knowledge publishing engine as is a [[Creative Commons]] license compatible with the original work.&lt;ref&gt;Florez, Dean, Charles Cook, Eric Frank, and Dennis Passovoy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20693">{{Porcelain of France|Chantilly plate 1750 1755.jpg|Image explanation=Chantilly, 1750-1755.}}
'''French porcelain''' has a history spanning a period from the 17th century to the present. The French were heavily involved in the early European efforts to discover the secrets of making the [[hard-paste porcelain]] known from [[Chinese export porcelain|Chinese]] and [[Japanese export porcelain]].  They succeeded in developing [[soft-paste porcelain]], but [[Meissen porcelain]] was the first to make true hard-paste, around 1710, and the French took over 50 years to catch up with Meissen and the other German factories. 

But by the 1760s, [[kaolin]] had been discovered near [[Limoges]], and the relocated royal-owned [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres|Sèvres factory]] took the lead in European porcelain design as [[rococo]] turned into what is broadly known as the [[Louis XVI style]] and then the [[Empire style]].  French styles were soon being imitated in porcelain in Germany, England, and as far afield as Russia.  They were also imitated in the cheaper French [[faience]], and this and other materials elsewhere.  This dominance lasted until at least 1830.  

Before the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, French production was complicated by various royal [[patent]]s and [[monopoly|monopolies]] restricting the production of various types of wares, which could sometimes be circumvented by obtaining the "protection" of a member of the royal family or senior courtier; this might or might not involve ownership by them. 

Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, France had a vigorous [[faience]] industry, making high-quality [[tin-glazed]] earthenware that remained in touch with artistic fashion.  At least before 1800, this catered to the lower end of the market very successfully, so that porcelain factories concentrated on the top end, in France and elsewhere.  Compared to other European countries, French manufacturers have generally concentrated on tablewares and decorative vessels rather than figures, with [[Mennecy-Villeroy porcelain]] being something of an exception.&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 107&lt;/ref&gt;  Where figures and groups were produced, these were most often in the French invention of unglazed [[biscuit porcelain]].

[[Chinese porcelain]] had long been imported from [[China]], and was a very expensive and desired luxury. Chinese porcelains were treasured, collected from the time of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], and sometimes adorned with elaborate mountings of precious metal to protect them and enhance their beauty. Huge amounts especially of [[silver]] were sent from Europe to China&lt;ref&gt;Credit being unavailable or unmanageable in the East, "in the end, the Europeans had to have recourse to precious metals, particularly American silver, which was the 'open sesame' of these trades", observes Fernand Braudel, ''The Perspective of the World'' (''Civization &amp; Capitalism'', vol. III) :217; cf. section 'Gold and silver: strength or weakness?' p. 490f.&lt;/ref&gt; to pay for the desired Chinese porcelain wares, and numerous attempts were made to duplicate the material.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NGw8DUuNywYC&amp;pg=PA240 ''Chinese glazes: their origins, chemistry, and recreation'' Nigel Wood p.240]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was at the [[Nevers manufactory]] that Chinese-style [[blue and white porcelain|blue and white wares]] were produced for the first time in France, with production running between 1650 and 1680.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mkJfbdTS--UC&amp;pg=PA38 ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Materials and Techniques in Art'' Gerald W. R. Ward p.38]&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese styles would then be taken up by factories in [[Normandy]], especially following the foundation of the [[French East India Company]] in 1664.&lt;ref name="Ward"/&gt;

The first soft-paste porcelain in France was developed in an effort to imitate high-valued Chinese [[hard-paste porcelain]],&lt;ref name="Barber 5"/&gt; and follow the attempts of [[Medici porcelain]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vhw-EQVViHMC&amp;pg=PA193 ''Hydrocolloid applications: gum technology in the food and other industries'' A. Nussinovitch p.193]&lt;/ref&gt; The first soft-paste [[frit]] porcelain, was produced at the [[Rouen manufactory]] in 1673, in order to mimic ''"la véritable porcelaine de Chine"'' ("The true porcelain of China"),&lt;ref name="Barber 5"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AQH3op9kyvcC&amp;pg=PP12 ''Artificial Soft Paste Porcelain - France, Italy, Spain and England'' Edwin Atlee Barber p.5-6]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2ztZyIvbxvcC&amp;pg=PA239 ''Porcelain'' Edward Dillon p.239]&lt;/ref&gt; and became known as "Porcelaine française".&lt;ref name="Barber 5"/&gt; The technique of producing the new material was discovered by the Rouen [[pottery|potter]] Louis Poterat;&lt;ref name="Barber 5"/&gt; his licence to make "faience and porcelain" was taken out in 1673, signed by the king and [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]]&lt;ref&gt;M. L. Solon, "The Rouen Porcelain", ''The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs,'' '''7''' No. 26 (May 1905:116-124) p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The soft porcelain used blue designs of the type already used in the faiences of the period.&lt;ref name="Barber 5"/&gt; Dr. [[Martin Lister]] reported from his voyage to Paris, printed in 1698, that a manufacture of porcelain "as white and translucid as the one that came from the East" was in full operation at [[Saint-Cloud porcelain|Saint-Cloud]].&lt;ref&gt;Lister, ''Relation of a Journey to Paris'', London, 1698, noted in Solon 1905:116.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French lexicographer [[Jacques Savary des Brûlons]] wrote in 1722 about these first experiments in his ''Dictionnaire universel du commerce'':

''"Fifteen or twenty years ago an attempt was made in France to copy Chinese porcelain : the first attempts made in Rouen were quite successful, (...) these faience objects from new factories are not ranked as French faience - this is the genuine porcelain invented by the French during the last few years and manufactured successively in Rouen, Passy near Paris, and then in Saint Cloud."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyrillefroissart.com/fr/fiche.php3?id_article=1838 Faïences et porcelaines du XVIème au XIXème siècle]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]] set up the [[Royal Factory of Saint-Cloud]] in 1664 in order to make copies (In the original ''"Contre-façons"'', i.e. "Fakes") of "Indian-style" porcelain.&lt;ref name="McCabe 220"/&gt; Saint-Cloud became a very important manufactory for the new wares.

However, once French manufacturers discovered how to produce a much wider range of colours in porcelain by the 1730s, using [[overglaze]] "enamel" decoration, they abandoned [[underglaze]] blue more quickly and thoroughly than those of other European countries - some English factories continued to make a significant proportion of blue and white wares until the end of the century and beyond.

==Asian polychrome designs==
[[File:Saint Cloud soft paste porcelain flower holder Famille Rose 1730 1740.jpg|thumb|[[Saint-Cloud porcelain|Saint-Cloud soft-paste porcelain]] flower holder, in  Chinese "[[Famille Rose]]" style, 1730-1740.]]
Louis XIV had received 1,500 pieces of porcelain from the [[Siamese embassy to France (1686)|Siamese Embassy to France]] in 1686, but the manufacturing secret had remained elusive.&lt;ref name="McCabe 220"/&gt; 

France finally discovered the Chinese technique of [[hard-paste porcelain]] through the efforts of the [[Jesuit]] Father [[François Xavier d'Entrecolles]] between 1712 and 1722.&lt;ref name="McCabe 220"&gt;Baghdiantz McCabe, Ina (2008) ''Orientalism in Early Modern France'', {{ISBN|978-1-84520-374-0}}, Berg Publishing, Oxford, p.220''ff''&lt;/ref&gt; The letters sent to Father Orry in Paris were first published by [[Jean-Baptiste Du Halde]] in 1735, with English editions appearing in 1736 or 1738.&lt;ref name="Needham 37"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mabcHwmAD5oC&amp;pg=PA37 ''Ceramic technology'' by Rose Kerr, Nigel Wood, Joseph Needham p.37]&lt;/ref&gt; The letters were later again published by Abbé [[Jean-Baptiste Grosier]] in his ''General Description of China''.&lt;ref name="Marryat"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QrRCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA190 ''A history of pottery and porcelain: mediæval and modern'' by Joseph Marryat p.190]&lt;/ref&gt; D'Entrecolles also sent material specimens to Europe, which were analysed by [[Réaumur]], and led to the establishment of the [[Sèvres Manufactory]] once equivalent materials were found in Europe.&lt;ref name="Marryat"/&gt;

After 1730, polychrome porcelain also came to be produced, often in imitation of Chinese polychrome styles of porcelain, such as the "[[Famille rose]]" types. The Japanese ''[[Kakiemon]]'' style of [[Arita porcelain]], [[Japan]], known as "Fleurs indiennes" ("Flowers of the Indies") was also used as an inspiration, especially in [[Saint-Cloud porcelain]] and [[Chantilly porcelain]]. A patent granted to the Chantilly factory in 1735 by [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] specifically describes the right to make porcelain ''façon de Japon'' ("in imitation of the porcelain of Japan").&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jGsVHV098K0C&amp;pg=PA223 ''The Grove encyclopedia of decorative arts'' Gordon Campbell p.223]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the manufacturing technique of soft-paste porcelain seems to have been transmitted to England by French [[Huguenot]] refugees. The first soft-paste in England was demonstrated by Thomas Briand to the [[Royal Society]] in 1742 and is believed to have been based on the Saint-Cloud formula.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3itNPs2omK0C&amp;pg=PA92 ''18th-Century English Porcelain'' by George Savage, p.92]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of original French designs==
[[File:Elephant Candelabrum Vase, 1757-1758, Sèvres Porcelain Manufactory, probably designed by Jean-Claude Duplessis, painted by Pierre-Louis-Philippe Armand - Art Institute of Chicago - DSC09441.JPG|thumb|Elephant-head vase, 1757-1758, one of Sèvres's most exuberant designs, made in pairs.]]
After this initial period, up to the end of the 18th century, French porcelain manufactories would progressively abandon their Chinese and Japanese designs, to become more French in character.&lt;ref name="McCabe 220"/&gt; [[Vincennes porcelain|Vincennes soft-paste porcelain]] started to display original French inspiration towards its last years of operation, after which the abundant, varied, and original productions of [[Sèvres porcelain]] continued the trend.  [[Biscuit porcelain]] was first used at Vincennes in 1751 by the director [[Jean-Jacques Bachelier]]; this simply involved not glazing or painting the piece after a single firing, leaving a matt surface resembling marble.&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 108&lt;/ref&gt;  But the pieces had to be perfect, as there was no glaze to cover up faults, so in practice the wastage made them more expensive to produce. Brilliant new colours were developed at Vincennes and Sèvres in the 1750s and 1760s, especially a blue and a rose.&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 108-109&lt;/ref&gt; These were often shown off as the ground colour of the body, with painted decoration within compartments left with a white ground. 

In 1756 the Vincennes factory was moved to [[Sèvres]], where it still remains in production, and in 1759 it was bought by the king, although his mistress [[Madame de Pompadour]] was allowed effective free reign to oversee it. A period of superb quality in both design and production followed, creating much of the enduring reputation of French porcelain. The light-hearted Rococo was given a more serious air, often by restricting it to the painting, rather than the porcelain shape.&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 108-109&lt;/ref&gt;

Porcelain production further developed with [[Limoges porcelain]], a type of [[hard-paste porcelain]] produced by factories near the city of [[Limoges]], [[France]]. The manufacturing of hard-paste porcelain in Limoges was established in 1771 following the discovery of local supplies of [[kaolin]] and a material similar to [[petuntse]] in the economically distressed area at [[Saint-Yrieix-la-Perche]], near Limoges.  In parallel, soft-paste porcelain continued to be manufactured however, as it was less expensive to produce.&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 109&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nast porcelain]] (1783-1835) and [[Dihl and Guérhard porcelain|Dihl and Guérhard]] (1781-1828) were two of a number of factories making very high-quality porcelain in Paris in the decades around 1800.  This contrasted with London, where the factories had all closed or removed north by 1775, although the capital remained, like Paris, a centre for decorating plain "blanks" made elsewhere - in France often in [[Limoges porcelain]].  [[Dagoty and Honoré]] and Darte were other Paris factories.  By 1830 most factories had closed or moved to Limoges.&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 156-157&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empire style==
Even before the French revolution, the initially severe style of Neoclassicism had begun to turn grandiose and ornate in goods for the courts of the [[Ancien Régime]].  This trend deepened with the rise of Napoleon, which followed a difficult period for French porcelain factories. The [[Empire style]] was marked by lavish [[gilding]], strong colours, and references to military conquests; Napoleon's ultimately unsuccessful expedition to [[Egypt]] sparked a fashion for "Neo-Egyptian" wares.

In 1800 Napoleon, as Minister of the Interior, appointed [[Alexandre Brongniart]] director at Sèvres; he was to stay 47 years, making many changes. The factory concentrated on tableware and larger decorative pieces such as vases and table centrepieces, much of it for the government to use or give as diplomtic presents.&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 155&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==19th-century==
The Empire style grew more elaborate and ostentatious as the century continued, developing most aspects of "Victorian" taste in a French style. Under the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] from 1852-70, there was a revival of Louis XVI style at Sèvres, often more heavily painted and gilded.  Many of the old moulds which the factory had kept were used again.&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 156&lt;/ref&gt;  

Apart from Sèvres, most factories had moved to [[Limoges]] by about 1830, with many companies making [[Limoges porcelain]], of which [[Haviland &amp; Co.]] was the most sccessful. This was founded in the 1840s by porcelain importers in America, and a strong market in America supported them through rough patches.  They also led a reconnection of ceramics with contemporary trends in the fine arts, especially [[Japonisme]], using artists such as [[Ernest Chaplet]] (though much of his work was in [[stoneware]] rather than porcelain) and [[Félix Bracquemond]].  Around Paris the factory of Jacob Petit at [[Fontainebleau]] opened in 1834, and the questionable career of [[Edmé Samson]] began in the same decade.&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 156-157&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sèvres porcelain manufactory, Pot-pourri vases, 1761 at Waddesdon Manor (cropped).jpg|thumb|The three 'boat shaped' potpourri vases that are located at [[Waddesdon Manor]], 1761. ]]
Sèvres turned to a more diluted version of Japonisme after 1870, and in 1897, a new artistic director, A. Sandier, introduced new [[Art Nouveau]] styles, followed about a decade later by styles leading to [[Art Deco]].&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 156&lt;/ref&gt;

The display of Sèvres porcelain in the English Country House is another by-product of the 19th century and flourishes especially within what is known as 'Rothschildshire' (the county of [[Buckinghamshire]]). The family's history of collecting and its development of the distinctive ‘[[goût Rothschild]]’ (Rothschild style) results in some of the most iconic Sèvres being located at [[Waddesdon Manor]], [[Ferdinand de Rothschild|Baron de Rothschild's]] weekend 'pleasure house'. As Mark Girouard denotes, "opulence was the key-note of this"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/695587648|title=A hundred years at Waddesdon|last=1931-|first=Girouard, Mark,|date=1998|publisher=Rothschild Waddesdon|isbn=0952780925|location=Buckinghamshire, U.K.|oclc=695587648}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus "eighteenth-century French furniture, porcelain and bronzes of superb quality combined"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; dominated this specific 19th-century collection. Ferdinand's first purchase of Sèvres is a poignant narrative at Waddesdon manor, in which at 21 years old, he treated himself to the famous turquoise Sèvres 'boat shaped' potpourri vase "which he bought in instalments and is still at Waddesdon"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

==History==
The project was conceived by [[Katie Paterson]] during the summer of 2014. It is managed by the Future Library Trust and supported by the [[Oslo|City of Oslo]], [[Norway]]. It was produced for the Slow Space public art program and commissioned by [[Bjørvika]], Oslo's former container port, and its development corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.futurelibrary.no/|title=Future Library – Framtidsbiblioteket - Katie Paterson|page=About|accessdate=2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscripts will be held in a specially designed room at the new [[Oslo Public Library|Deichman Library]] (Oslo Public Library) currently under construction in Bjørvika, Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Reader offer: buy a Katie Paterson Future Library limited-edition print|url = https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/nov/23/reader-offer-katie-paterson-print-future-library|newspaper = the Guardian|date=November 23, 2014 |first = Vanessa|last = Thorpe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = In English|url = http://blogg.deichman.no/nyedeichman/in-english/|accessdate = 2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Katie Paterson has been working with the architectural team to design this part of the new public library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nothingintherulebook.com/2018/05/23/creatives-in-profile-interview-with-katie-paterson/|title=Creatives in profile – interview with Katie Paterson|date=2018-05-23|work=nothingintherulebook|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collected works will be on display but the manuscripts will not be available for reading.

'''Karin Albou''' is a French director, screenwriter and actress.

==Early life==
Karin Albou was born on in March 12, 1968 &lt;ref&gt;http://inter.pyramidefilms.com/pyramidefilms-international-catalogue/karin-albou.html in &lt;/ref&gt;[[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] to [[Algeria]]n immigrant parents. Her mother was only 16 when she was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karin Albou|url=http://www.mymoviepicker.com/personne/karin-albou-138361.htm|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albou was raised in the [[Jewish]] faith. In 1999 she moved to Tunisia to settle down for one year. She went back to Paris and started her career as a filmmaker.

As a child, Karin Albou was always finding ways to be an artist; involved with dance and singing. After high school, Karin continued to study dance, but also studied Hebrew French and Arabic literature, English, drama and eventually enrolled in film school in Paris. She studied screening writing in Paris but discovered while taking classes at École Supérieure de Réalisation Audiovisuelle&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/École_Supérieure_de_Réalisation_Audiovisuelle&lt;/ref&gt; she wanted to be a director. After she graduated, she started her journey as a director with her first short film “Hush!” establishing the beginning of her remarkable career path. 

==Career==
Albou made her feature film debut in 2005 with ''[[Little Jerusalem (film)|Little Jerusalem]]'' which debuted at the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]] in the [[International Critics' Week]]. Despite being Albou's first feature film Albou was disqualified from competing for the Camera d'Or, awarded to the best first film playing at the festival, because she had previously directed a made-for-TV movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Camera d'Or disqualifies 3 directors|url=https://www.imdb.com/news/ni0206842/|access-date=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Albou released her second feature film ''[[Le Chant des mariées|The Wedding Song]]'', a [[Holocaust]] drama set in [[Tunisia]] in 1942 that was loosely inspired by letters Albou's paternal grandmother had sent to her husband during the war when he was sent to a labour camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Esther|first1=John|date=6 November 2009|title=EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: KARIN ALBOU|url=http://jestherent.blogspot.ca/2009/11/exclusive-interview-karin-albou.html|access-date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film played multiple Jewish festivals but failed to garner mainstream attention something Albou attributed to the many scenes of graphic nudity in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Curiel|first1=Jonathan|date=19 July 2009|title='Wedding Song' offers fresh take on feminity &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93;|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Wedding-Song-offers-fresh-take-on-feminity-3292152.php|website=SFGate.com|access-date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Albou's third feature film ''My Shortest Love Affair'' was released in 2015. Albou also co-starred in the film as a woman in her 40s who becomes pregnant after a one-night stand with a former fling and who decides to try to make a go of it with the father of her future child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=My Shortest Love Affair|url=http://sfjff.org/2015/films/my-shortest-love-affair/|access-date=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles and Themes==
Karin Albou is a very distinct director, one of the ways to distinguish her is the themes in her films. Knowing Karin’s heritage explains some of the themes she chooses to cover. Raised in the Jewish faith, Karin's films explore the lasting trauma of the Holocaust&lt;ref&gt;Lechintan, Adela A. "Cinematic Reverberations of Historical Trauma: Women's Memories of the Holocaust and Colonialism in Contemporary French-Language Cinema." Order No. 3493307, (The Ohio State University, 2011), 91. https://search.proquest.com/docview/919704252?accountid=14523.
&lt;/ref&gt; – French colonialism&lt;ref&gt;Schoonover, Karl and Rosalind Galt, Queer Cinema in the World. Durham: Duke University Press, 2017. 231-36. 
&lt;/ref&gt;, secret identity&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, John. "Secret Identity, Sumptuous Film:" The Gazette, Oct 29, 2005. https://search.proquest.com/docview/434250723?accountid=14523.
&lt;/ref&gt;, exile, assimilation&lt;ref&gt;"Writer, Director, Actress Karin Albou in Interview." Interview by Sharon Adler. Aviva-Berlin. May 15, 2009. https://www.aviva-berlin.de/aviva/content_Interviews.php?id=1425092.&lt;/ref&gt;, and double diaspora&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Stephanie. "Double-Diaspora in the Literature and Film of Arab Jews." Order No. NR98058, University of Ottawa (Canada), 2012. https://search.proquest.com/docview/1355763142?accountid=14523.

&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Karin explores and challenges the rules of religion and marriages. Karin directs My Shortest Love Affair with themes of love, sex and family values&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Josh. "Love, Sex and Family Values all a Tangle in 'My Shortest Love Affair'." The Jewish News Weekly of Northern California : J, Jul 17, 2015. https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779870367?accountid=14523.
&lt;/ref&gt;. Her themes involve bringing intimate scenes of female spaces, tackling sexual dysfunction in marriage and uncovering how culture impacts the idea of romance&lt;ref&gt;Wilmington Michael, Tribune, movie critic. "'Jerusalem' Puts Cultures in Opposition to Romance ; 'La Petite Jerusalem' ***." Chicago Tribune, May 05, 2006. https://search.proquest.com/docview/420477406?accountid=14523.
&lt;/ref&gt;. Karin keeps these themes consistent in her films and portrays them with her unique film style. Her style focuses on the representation of women&lt;ref&gt;Al-Hossain, Haya. "Feminist Representations in North African Cinema." Order No. 3449116, The George Washington University, 2011, 168 - 169. https://search.proquest.com/docview/861742163?accountid=14523.&lt;/ref&gt;. In The Wedding Song, the film style displays a lesbian, female, and  Orientalist gaze.

Many Jews from Tunisia, a former French colony, were forced to resettle in France, leading to the transformation of Judeo-Arabic culture from Tunisia to Paris. Karin explores the group's culture shock, recalling fondly of Tunisia, but also speaking of the pain of becoming outcasts in their own land. She interviewed young Jews who are as French as they are Tunisian, where they speak about the emergence of their identity in the mosaic of contemporary France. Through these intimate relationship Karin reveals a complex experience of exile and assimilation. A pilgrimage back to Tunisia uncovers the identification of three generations of Jews who continue to feel for the country left behind.&lt;ref&gt;https://sfjff.org/watch-online/jfi-on-demand/my-country-left-me&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Albou made her feature film debut in 2005 with ''[[Little Jerusalem (film)|Little Jerusalem]]'' which debuted at the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]] in the [[International Critics' Week]]. Despite being Albou's first feature film Albou was disqualified from competing for the Camera d'Or, awarded to the best first film playing at the festival, because she had previously directed a made-for-TV movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Camera d'Or disqualifies 3 directors|url=https://www.imdb.com/news/ni0206842/|access-date=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Albou released her second feature film ''[[Le Chant des mariées|The Wedding Song]]'', a [[Holocaust]] drama set in [[Tunisia]] in 1942 that was loosely inspired by letters Albou's paternal grandmother had sent to her husband during the war when he was sent to a labour camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Esther|first1=John|date=6 November 2009|title=EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: KARIN ALBOU|url=http://jestherent.blogspot.ca/2009/11/exclusive-interview-karin-albou.html|access-date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film played multiple Jewish festivals but failed to garner mainstream attention something Albou attributed to the many scenes of graphic nudity in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Curiel|first1=Jonathan|date=19 July 2009|title='Wedding Song' offers fresh take on feminity &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93;|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Wedding-Song-offers-fresh-take-on-feminity-3292152.php|website=SFGate.com|access-date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''L.A.

==Background==
In June 1953, [[Ike Jones]] became the first African American to graduate from the UCLA Film School.&lt;ref name='Jet-16Oct1952'&gt;{{cite journal |editor1-first=John H. |editor1-last=Johnson |date=October 16, 1952 |title=Football Player To Pioneer In Hollywood Films |journal=Jet |volume=2 |issue=25 |page=54 |publisher=Johnson Publishing Company, Inc. |location=Chicago, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next 15 years, the numbers of African-American filmmakers remained small.  One of those was [[Vantile Whitfield]], who founded the Performing Arts Society of Los Angeles in 1964 and received a master's degree at UCLA in 1967.&lt;ref name='Post-Obit'&gt;{{cite news |title=Arts Administrator, Playwright Vantile Whitfield Dies |author= |first=Yvonne |last=Shinhoster Lamb |authorlink= |authorlink2= |author2= |author3= |author4= |author5= |author6= |author7= |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A29685-2005Jan22 |format= |agency= |newspaper=Washington Post |publisher= |location=Washington, DC |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=2005-01-23 |page= |pages= |at= |accessdate=2011-11-13 |language= |trans-title=|quote=He graduated with a bachelor's degree in theater and design from Howard University in 1957 and a master's degree in film production from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1967.

Among this new crop of artists were [[Charles Burnett (director)|Charles Burnett]], an engineering student who had attended [[Los Angeles City College]], and [[Haile Gerima]], an Ethiopian filmmaker who had recently moved from Chicago. Unlike their predecessors, they eschewed Hollywood conventions and were influenced by films from Latin America, [[Italian neorealism]], European art films, and the emerging [[cinema of Africa]].  They were among the first of what became known as the "Los Angeles School of Black Filmmakers."&lt;ref name='Washington-Post'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Images'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue05/features/black.htm |title=Black Independent Cinema and the Influence of Neo-Realism |first=Chris |last=Norton |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |month= |year= |work=Images: A Journal of Film and Popular Culture |publisher= |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans-title=|arxiv= |asin= |bibcode= |doi= |doibroken= |isbn= |issn= |jfm= |jstor= |lccn= |mr= |oclc= |ol= |osti= |pmc = |embargo= |pmid= |rfc= |ssrn= |zbl= |id= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |accessdate=2011-10-02 |quote=Most notable of these filmmakers were Charles Burnett, Billy Woodberry, Haile Gerima and Julie Dash.

In the wake of the [[Watts Riots]] and other forms of [[Rebellion|social unrest]], such as a 1969 shoot-out on the UCLA campus involving [[Ron Karenga]]'s US Organization, Burnett and several other students of color helped push the university to start an [[Ethnographic film|ethnographic]] studies program.&lt;ref name='LAWeekly-6Oct2011'/&gt; Elyseo J.

Rebellion." The group included such soon-to-be-celebrated artists as Charles Burnett, Larry Clark, Julie Dash, Haile Gerima, Ben Caldwell, Billy Woodberry, Alile Sharon Larkin, Jacqueline Frazier, Jamaa Fanaka and Barbara McCullough. The UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive is currently preparing a major film exhibition scheduled for 2011 which will explore this key artistic movement.|ref= |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification of movement==
Film scholar [[Clyde Taylor]] coined the term "L.A. Rebellion" to describe the filmmakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cinema.ucla.edu/blogs/archival-spaces/2011/10/28/what%E2%80%99s-name-la-rebellion|title=What's in a Name? L.A.

In the spring of 1997, Doc Films, a student-run film society based at the [[University of Chicago]], hosted one of the first retrospectives of L.A. Rebellion films. [[Jacqueline Stewart]], an associate professor at the university, helped coordinate the program.  This series included works by [[Charles Burnett (director)|Charles Burnett]], [[Haile Gerima]] and [[Julie Dash]].&lt;ref name='Doc-LAR'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blackfilm.uchicago.edu/campus_resources/doc_films.shtml |title=Doc Films |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |month= |year= |work= |publisher=University of Chicago |location=Chicago, Illinois |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans-title=|arxiv= |asin= |bibcode= |doi= |doibroken= |isbn= |issn= |jfm= |jstor= |lccn= |mr= |oclc= |ol= |osti= |pmc = |embargo= |pmid= |rfc= |ssrn= |zbl= |id= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |accessdate= |quote= |ref= |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Fall 2011, UCLA Film and Television Archive programmed a major retrospective of these films entitled, "L.A. Rebellion: Creating a New Black Cinema." The series was funded by the Getty Foundation as a part of ''Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980''.&lt;ref name="UCLA-LAR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LAWeekly-6Oct2011" /&gt; Preceding the program, the UCLA curatorial team conducted oral histories, identifying nearly fifty filmmakers, many of whom had remained invisible for decades. Papers and films by the filmmakers were collected and numerous films were preserved before screening. A catalog was also published, "L.A. Rebellion: Creating a New Black Cinema (Los Angeles, 2011), which accompanied the touring program through more than fifteen cities in North America and Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6443">The '''Limburg Staurotheke''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]], stauros “[[cross]]” and theke “[[container]]”) is an example of a [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] [[reliquary]]. It was crafted sometime in the mid to late 10th century in [[Constantinople]]. The box measures 48 centimeters by 35 centimeters and has a depth of 6 centimeters. This reliquary design was common in Byzantium beginning in the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=Holger A.|title=Eastern Objects and Western Desires: Relics and Reliquaries between Byzantium and the West|journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers|date=2004|volume=58|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Limburg Staurotheke is currently housed in [[Germany]] in the Limburg an der Lahn.

== Description and History ==
[[File:Intérieur de Limbourg.jpg|thumb|The interior of the Limburg Staurotheke with the True Cross reliquary in place.]]
The Limburg Staurotheke consists of two parts that were made at separate times. The removable, double-armed cross was made first and holds seven fragments of the [[True Cross]] in the middle of the cross where its main set of arms meets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hostetler|first1=Bradley A.|title=The Limburg Staurotheke: A Reassessment|journal=Anthanor|date=2012|volume=30|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cross is made out of [[sycamore]] wood and is entirely covered in gilded [[silver]] and embellished with gemstones and pearls. Inscribed on the back of the cross is the following verse:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ševčenko|first1=Nancy|title=The Celebration of the Saints in Byzantine Art and Liturgy (Burlington, VT: Ashgate Variorum, 2013), 2–3.|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Variorum|location=Burlington, Vermont|pages=2–3}} Translated from Medieval Greek.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{poemquote|text=God stretched out his hands upon the wood,
gushing forth through it the energies of life.
And Constantine and Romanos the emperors
have with the addition of radiant stones and pearls
made this same full of wonder.
Upon it Christ formerly smashed the gates of hell,
giving new life to the dead. 
And the crowned ones who have now adorned it,
crush with it the temerities of the barbarians
}}

The two emperors mentioned in the inscription are [[Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos]] and [[Romanos II]], his son. They ruled jointly from 945 to 959, meaning that the cross would have been constructed during their rule.

[[File:Couvercle de Limbourg.jpg|thumb|The lid of the Limburg Staurotheke]]
The box and its sliding, removable lid were made second and is designed to hold the cross reliquary in the center of the box. Surrounding the cross are ten [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] panels that depict angels wearing court outfits. Next to the angels are 10 more panels that each depict a pair of either [[cherubim]] or [[seraphim]]. The panels depicting the cherubim and seraphim are the containers that hold ten relics and each compartment has an inscription that identifies the [[relic]] housed inside. Six relics are Passion relics and are ascribed to [[Christ (title)|Christ]], three to the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], and one to [[John the Baptist]]. The relics in the compartments of the theke are:
* The swaddling clothes of Jesus
* The sponge used to give Christ water during his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]
* The crown of thorns worn by Christ during his crucifixion
* The winding sheet Christ was wrapped in while in his tomb
* The towel used by Christ to wash the feet of his [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] during the [[Last Supper]]
* The purple himation worn by Christ during his crucifixion (mentioned in John 19:2)
* The belt of the Virgin Mary from [[Chalkoprateia]]
* The belt of the Virgin Mary brought from Zela
* The maphorion of the Virgin Mary
* Locks of hair from St. John the Baptist

[[File:LM Staurothek Pantokrator.JPG|thumb|Close up of [[Christ Pantocrator]] on the middle enamel panel of the lid of the Limburg Staurotheke]]

The lid of the box, like the cross and inner compartments of the theke, is covered in gilded silver and lavishly decorated with gemstones. It features nine enamel panels that portray the [[Deesis]], a scene that depicts Christ in a throne, accompanied by the Virgin Mary and St. John the Baptist and surrounded by angels. On the lid of the Limburg Staurotheke, Christ is seen in the middle panel, with John the Baptist to his left and the Virgin Mary to his right. The [[archangels]] [[Gabriel (archangel)|Gabriel]] and [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] stand next to John the Baptist and the Virgin Mary.  The top and bottom panels portray the twelve Apostles. On an outer border framing the panels are the busts of eight unidentified figures, though they are likely images of four military saints and four important church leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ševčenko|first1=Nancy|title=The Celebration of the Saints in Byzantine Art and Liturgy|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Variorum|location=Burlington, Vermont|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theke itself features an inscription on the outer rim that states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Hahn|editor1-first=Cynthia|editor2-last=Klein|editor2-first=Holger A.|title=Saints and Sacred Matter: The Cult of Relics in Byzantium and Beyond|date=2015|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection|location=Washington D.C.|page=246}} Translated from Medieval Greek.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{poemquote|text=No beauty had He, who was hanged on the Wood,
and yet, even in death, Christ surpassed all beauty.
While He had no comely form, He embellished my
unsightly face disfigured by sin and transgression.
For, though He was God, He suffered in mortals’ nature.
Since Basil the Proedros highly revered Him,
he greatly embellished the box of the wood,

on which He was stretched and embraced all creation.
}}  

The inscription reveals that [[Basil Lekapenos]] was the benefactor of the staurotheke. Basil was the bastard son of Emperor [[Romanos I Lekapenos]] and was made a eunuch likely as a child. He would become a powerful figure in the imperial court. Emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] gave him the title of ''[[proedros]]'' in 963. The theke was likely made between 963 and 985, when Basil was exiled from the imperial court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pentcheva|first1=Bissera V.|title=Containers of Power: Eunuchs and Reliquaries in Byzantium|date=2007|volume=51|issue=108-120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26476">Chinese musical instruments were traditionally grouped into 8 categories known as ''bayin'' ([[wikt:八音|八音]]).&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02rFSecPhEsC&amp;pg=PA260&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Harvard Dictionary of Music |editor= Don Michael Randel |pages=260–262 |publisher=Harvard University Press |edition=4th |year= 2003 |isbn=978-0674011632 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The eight categories are: [[silk]], [[bamboo]], [[wood]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], [[metal]], [[clay]], [[gourd]] and [[skin]].

==Playing contexts==
Chinese instruments are either played solo, collectively in large orchestras (as in the former imperial court) or in smaller ensembles (in teahouses or public gatherings). Normally, there is no conductor in traditional Chinese music, nor any use of musical scores or tablature in performance. Music was generally learned aurally and memorized by the musician(s) beforehand, then played without aid. As of the 20th century, musical scores have become more common, as has the use of conductors in larger orchestral-type ensembles.

==Musical instruments in use in the 1800s==
These watercolour illustrations, made in China in the 1800s, show several types of musical instruments being played:

The '''National Center of Afro-American Artists''' ('''NCAAA''') is an institution founded in 1968 by [[Elma Lewis]] to "preserv[e] and foster[] the cultural arts heritage of black peoples worldwide through arts teaching, and the presentation of professional works in all fine arts disciplines."&lt;ref name="NCAAA History"&gt;[http://www.ncaaa.org/ncaaahistory.html NCAAA History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141122083554/http://www.ncaaa.org/ncaaahistory.html |date=2014-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the organization's name specifies [[African American]] artists, the organizational mandate includes all [[African art|African diasporic art]].

The [[museum]] subsumed Lewis' previously launched "Elma Lewis School of Fine Arts" (ELSFA). The NCAAA is the largest independent black cultural arts institution in [[New England]], United States.

At its founding, the NCAAA  was housed in a former [[fire station|firehouse]] in [[Franklin Park (Boston)|Franklin Park]], [[Boston]]. The museum was moved to a separate building in 1980 and is now located at the '''[[Abbotsford (Boston, Massachusetts)|Museum of the National Center of Afro-American Artists]]'''.

Two fires in the early 1980s significantly damaged the firehouse, where the NCAAA was housed, although collections stored at the museum, which had its own facility, were unharmed.&lt;ref name="NCAAA History"/&gt;

Activities of the NCAAA have included:

* Establishment and maintenance of a museum;
* Hosting arts performances ("Black Musical Productions" and others) and exhibitions, individually and in collaboration with other fine arts museums in Boston;
* Offering arts education programs to a variety of students (professional, community primary students, and local prisoners).

[[Harriet Forte Kennedy]] served as the assistant director of the museum for some time.&lt;ref name="HellerHeller2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jules Heller|author2=Nancy G.

'''Neosymbolism''' is a movement current in the [[visual arts]] genre.  Active in the movement are artists in the United States, Denmark, the [[Czech Republic]], and Canada.

== Philosophy ==
The core philosophy of Neosymbolism, like that of its predecessor [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], is the idea of "correspondences", the "emblematic order" of a world in which technology and the industrial reality have not yet drowned the forces of mysticism and belief. In a world where visual images exist to generate sales and revenue, Neosymbolist imagery attempts to preserve the relationship between image and the human soul. The imagery is necessarily representational rather than abstract. It borders on the narrative, but stops short of the commercial trap of illustration to convey an idea for profit. Artists like [[Norman Rockwell]] could qualify as Neosymbolist painters in that they adopt a social and cultural undercurrent and then convey it in terms of the cultural cliche—the image as representative of core aspects of the culture. The same is not true, however, of the generally accepted idea of commercial illustration which attempts more to influence cultural, political, and economic ideology than it tries to communicate an existential reality.

Neosymbolism is fairly well-hidden within the culture, with few references and almost no broad-based visibility. In 1988, Nick A_Demos published a book in two editions. This was  the first visible sign of an idea underlying a Neosymbolist philosophy. A_Demos then developed this first book of Neosymbolism into paintings. He was also the first to use the word "Neosymbolism", thus coining it.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

There has also been a separate group using the Neosymbolism name for the creation of an international collective representing a number of artists who share the goals of preserving the visual art of Symbolism (the foundation of the ideas associated with the term Neosymbolism) in its original and essential sense. This preservation, as opposed to the "non-sense" of various philosophies that have evolved since the late nineteenth century and have deviated from the core Symbolist philosophy.
  
The Neosymbolist movement was born spontaneously in numerous locations across the globe. Many groups use the word but also do not want to be limited to only this discipline. A group of Danish Neosymbolists defined their movement thus:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arrkunst.webbyen.dk/vishjemmeside_privat.asp?mode=top_frame&amp;id=614394&amp;side=&amp;webside=4222305 |title=webbyen.dk |date=2011-07-19 |access-date=2017-02-07 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719132848/http://www.arrkunst.webbyen.dk/vishjemmeside_privat.asp?mode=top_frame&amp;id=614394&amp;side=&amp;webside=4222305 |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Reproducing the inner experience of the outer world  
* Examining the human experience and circumstance in today’s changing world
* Examining the underlying meaning of life
* Using media in conscious and innovative ways

The founder of the Canadian Neosymbolists, meanwhile, describes the foundations of their movement in ''Brief Summary of the Foundations of Canadian Neosymbolism,''{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} written by their founder, Gary F. Manzo.

* Using Symbolic language in our expressions, often derived from Dream Sequences and Archetypal Imagery as described by Carl Jung, and others involved with Mysticism, Alchemy, Depth Psychology and Philosophy. 
* Depicting the inner experience of the outer world, in relationship to Self-Actualization and Depth Psychology and related fields of study. 
* Examining the human experience and circumstance in today’s changing world, with the idea that mankind must “make friends with his animal nature” in order to achieve Wholeness of SELF in a contemporary world. 
* Examining the underlying meaning of life, both from an historical perspective and its relevancy to the new age of Technology as well as New Age Psychology. 
* Using mediums and techniques, in conscious, experimental and innovative ways, utilizing both traditional methods and contemporary cutting-edge techniques and technologies.

Another international Neosymbolist collective that began exhibiting as a group in 2001 has a simpler definition:
 
- The "exploration of the emotional, political, and spiritual themes of the rapidly changing culture of the late 20th and early 21st (century) through the use of symbols both personal and universal."{{cite quote|date=April 2015}}
  
This perspective of the Neosymbolist movement can be seen as a reaction against abstraction, an attempt to weave artists’ intellectual and spiritual experiences into the fabric of their work. Furthermore, the Neosymbolists’ palette is not limited to the use of words and ancient symbols of ideas, even as these remain powerful tools of expression.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

A '''Nomoli''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|oʊ|m|oʊ|l|iː}}) is a carved stone figurine native to [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Liberia]].&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://africa.si.edu/collections/view/objects/asitem/People$00401633/2/title-asc?t:state:flow=3d318f72-8617-4bde-ba1f-b19ed158e54b |title=National Museum of African Art |website=africa.si.edu |access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually made of [[soapstone]], [[limestone]] or [[granite]].&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="British Museum"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=628044&amp;partId=1 |title=nomoli figure |website=British Museum |language=en-GB |access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Nomoli figurines are among the earliest works of art from [[Sierra Leone]].&lt;ref name="Emory"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://carlos.emory.edu/exhibits/show/home/item/8011 |title=Figure, Pomdo or Nomoli · Michael C. Carlos Museum Collections Online |website=carlos.emory.edu |language=en-US |access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nomoli figurines and similar stone sculptures are the only known remains of an empire that existed hundreds of years ago in what is [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Liberia]] today.

Nomoli figurines are often associated with the [[Mende people|Mende]] people as they are often buried on [[Mende people|Mende]] land. They are used as oracles and for protection.&lt;ref name="Emory" /&gt;

Portuguese explorers recorded the presence of the figurines already in the fifteenth century.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt; 

The Mende and [[Kissi people]] of Sierra Leone put these small statues near their homes and in fields of crops for protection and increased vegetation, as they believe the Nomoli figurines will give them good health, good harvest, and meals to eat.&lt;ref name="Emory" /&gt; 

During the 20th century, Sierra Leonean immigrants brought their [[ancestor]]’s Nomoli figurines with them to the United States as a way to preserve the spiritual powers of the past.

== Characteristics and description ==
Along the coastal region, Nomoli figurines are often carved into a crouching stance with a small object in its hands. Most Nomoli figurines are made out of [[soapstone]], [[limestone]], steatite, and in some cases, [[granite]]. 

Their heads are oblong shaped. Nomoli figurines buried deeper underground tend to be more well preserved than the ones discovered just beneath the surface of the earth.

{{IPA notice}}
'''''Orihon''''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 折本, [[Hepburn Romanization| Hepburn]]: Orihon, {{IPA-ja|oɾihoɴ}}) is a book style originating from the Tang dynasty (A.D. 618-908) in China and was later developed in the Heian period (A.D. 794-1185) in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Binding Beauty: Conserving a Collection of Japanese Printed Books

Vol. 31, No. 2, Conservation at the Art Institute of Chicago (2005), pp. 16-23+105&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Livre-eventail-Japon.jpg|320px|right|Livre-eventail-Japon]]The development of orihon began in China but later took on an association with [[Japanese books]], as shown by its current name. "The development of alternatives to the roll in China is difficult to date, but it appears that at some time during the Tang period long rolls consisting of sheets of paper pasted together began to be folded alternately one way and the other to produce an effect like a concertina. It has been supposed that this form was suggested by the palm-leaf books which transmitted Buddhist texts from India to China. However that may be, it is in any case a fact that the concertina form was primarily used in China, and subsequently in Japan, for Buddhist texts. Books of this format are called orihon 折本 in Japan, and the format survived until the nineteenth century and beyond for printed Buddhist sūtras and occasionally for other books, such as reference lists, calendars, and folding maps."&lt;ref&gt;The Book in Japan: A Cultural History from the Beginnings to the Nineteenth Century by Peter Kornicki, p. 43. Retrieved from http://www.printsofjapan.com/Index_Glossary_O_thru_Ri.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Laura C. Liberman notes in an article that the accordion book style used in Tibet traces back to orihon origins.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;Lieberman, Laura C. "The Robert C. Williams American Museum of Papermaking." JAB: The Journal of Artist's Books 15 (2001): 12-13. ProQuest. Web. 11 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etymology ===
The combination of characters are borrowed from Chinese, which originally translates the phrase to "a loss" or "a loss of money." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.purpleculture.net/dictionary_details/?word=折本|title = Chinese Word - 折本|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, when looking at the individual characters, a different meaning is found. The Traditional Chinese characters are defined as 折 meaning "to break (e.g. stick or bone); a loss"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.purpleculture.net/dictionary-details/?word=折|title = Meaning of 折|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 本 meaning "roots or stems of plants; origin; source; this; the current; root; foundation; basis; classifier for books, periodicals, files etc originally,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.purpleculture.net/dictionary-details/?word=本|title = Meaning of 本|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, it means a breakdown of a book. In Japanese, it combines the roots "ori" (fold) and "hon" (book).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wordsense.eu/本/&lt;/ref&gt; Edith Diehl describes orihon as a general Asian style and translates it to "stabbed binding."&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, Edith. "Primative Records and Ancient Book Forms." Bookbinding; Its Background and Technique. New York: Rinehart &amp;, 1946. 12. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uses ===
Cyril James Humphries Davenport notes in his 1898 lecture that "writing upon a roll was found to be the most convenient at a very early date by the Chinese, Japanese and [K]oreans, they were also the first to find out that if the rolls were simply folded backwards and forwards between the "pages" of writing or printing, the whole book became easier to read, and this form, known as "Orihon," is used in those countries to the present day."&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, Cyril. "Lecture 1." Cantor Lectures on Decorative Bookbinding. London: Printed by William Trounce, 10, Gough Square, Fleet Street, E.C., 1898. 2. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional orihon books are associated with Japanese Buddhist works and [[e-hon]], or picture books. Modern applications are found in artistic modes, such as Tom Burtonwood's 2013 plastic rendering using a 3-D printer.&lt;ref&gt;http://tomburtonwood.com/portfolio-item/orihon-3d-printed-book/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Orihon-crop.png|framed|right|Utagawa Hiroshige (Japanese, 1797-1858) ''Sakkyo Kageboshi Zukushi'' (Collection of Improvised Silhouette Plays) n.d.]] --&gt;Orihon consist of a long strip of paper that is written on one side and then compacted by folding in zig-zag fashion. The orihon format is considered a step between a [[scroll]] and a [[codex]].

The style of folding is similar to that of the air bellows of a [[concertina]] or [[accordion]], such that every written page faces another written page when the book is closed. It may therefore be opened to any page.&lt;ref&gt;https://art2551.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/book_demo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It may have a cover attached to the front and back end sections of the book. Diehl describes orihon as having stabbed holes in the back cover to allow the book to be "laced."&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, Edith. "Primative Records and Ancient Book Forms." Bookbinding; Its Background and Technique. New York: Rinehart &amp;, 1946. 12. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oscar Tuazon''' (née Hansen) is an American artist based in Los Angeles who works in sculpture, architecture, and mixed media.

==Early life==
Oscar Tuazon was born Oscar Hansen on July 9, 1975, in a geodesic dome his parents built in the woods at Indianola, [[Kitsap County, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historylink.org/File/10987&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Deep Springs College]], [[Cooper Union]], and the Whitney Independent Study Program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/how-do-i-look-oscar-tuazon-artist-35-2008449.html How do I look?: Oscar Tuazon, artist, 35, [[The Independent]], June 26, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 he served as a founding board member at the [[Center for Urban Pedagogy]] in New York with his former Deep Springs classmate [[Damon Rich]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://welcometocup.org/People Center for Urban Pedagogy: People, Accessed April 18, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bombmagazine.org/article/5529/city-without-a-ghetto-center-for-urban-pedagogy "City Without a Ghetto, Center for Urban Pedagogy", Bomb Magazine Spring 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oscar met and married Lan Tuazon in New York in the mid-90s and changed his name from Oscar Hansen to Oscar Tuazon. The couple would later be divorced, but he kept the last name.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historylink.org/File/10987&lt;/ref&gt; His brother and frequent collaborator, Eli Hansen, is also an artist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/article/When-brothers-Eli-Hansen-and-Oscar-Tuazon-deliver-1271392.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parcsaintleger.fr/en/portfolio/oscar-tuazon-eli-hansen/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Professionally, he began his career working in the Studio Acconci of architect/artist [[Vito Acconci]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jul/28/artist-week-oscar-tuazon "Artist of the week 98: Oscar Tuazon," The Guardian, July 26, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to Paris in 2007, he began exhibiting widely in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vogue.fr/culture/agenda/articles/rencontre-avec-oscar-tuazon-la-biennale-de-venise-/19265 "Rencontre avec Oscar Tuazon à la Biennale de Venise," Paris Vogue]&lt;/ref&gt; He has since then exhibited at the [[Venice Biennale]], the [[Whitney Biennial]], and many group and solo shows throughout the world, and is in major art collections such as Saatchi's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/the-first-artists-on-the-waterfront/Content?oid=19141739 " The First Artists on the Waterfront," The Stranger, March 26, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/2012Biennial/OscarTuazon 2012 Whitney Biennial Exhibitions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418142536/http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/2012Biennial/OscarTuazon |date=2015-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A critic in the art magazine [[Frieze]] wrote in 2013 that "like his heroes, from [[Gordon Matta-Clark]] to wilderness survivalists, Tuazon’s non-conformist approach to artistic practice plays at the juncture of architecture, sculpture and performance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/oscar-tuazon/ "Oscar Tuazon," Frieze, April 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[New York Times]] review described his work as "haunting ... pit[ting] Mr. Acconci's robust ego against Mr. Tuazon's raw and fragile subjectivity." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/16/arts/design/16galleries-005.html "Oscar Tuazon: ‘My Flesh to Your Bare Bones’," New York Times, April 16, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 2013, he moved from France to the [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake]] neighborhood of Los Angeles with his three children and wife Dorothée Perret, a former editor at [[Purple (magazine)|Purple Magazine]] who now helms the art magazine "Paris, LA."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmagazine.com/people/2013/11/dorothee-perret/ "Dorothée Perret: Saint Laurent designer Hedi Slimane isn’t the only French expat to put down roots in Los Angeles," W Magazine, November 21, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sightunseen.com/2012/01/oscar-tuazon-artist-and-dorothee-perret-editor-2/ "At Home With Oscar Tuazon, artist, and Dorothée Perret, editor," Sight Unseen, January 25, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Petr''' (or '''Pyotr''') '''Andreyevich Pavlensky''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Пётр Андреевич Павленский}}; born March 8, 1984) is a Russian performance artist and political activist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/russia-eight-who-have-taken-a-stand/27208063.html|title=Eight Russians Who Have Taken A Stand|first=|last=RFE/RL|date=25 August 2015|publisher=|via=Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Early life and education ==
Born in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] in 1984, Pavlensky studied monumental art at the [[Saint Petersburg Art and Industry Academy]].&lt;ref name="PussyRiotLighterThanChrist"&gt;''V. Martinovich.'' [http://www.belgazeta.by/ru/2012_08_13/society/24602/ Petr Pavlensky: «Pussy Riot was much lighter and less harmful than Jesus Christ's actions»] // www.belgazeta.by. – 2012. – Aug.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ArtUnthinkableWithoutExperiment"&gt;''K.Petrov'' [http://www.rosbalt.ru/piter/2012/09/15/1034599.html Petr Pavlensky: «Art Is Unthinkable without Experiment»] // RosBalt. – 2012. – Sept. 15&lt;/ref&gt; During his fourth year in the Academy, he took additional training at St. Petersburg Pro Arte Foundation for Culture and Arts ([[:ru:Про Арте]]).&lt;ref name="ArtUnthinkableWithoutExperiment" /&gt;

== Career ==
Pavlensky and Oksana Shalygina founded an independent online newspaper ''Political Propaganda'' in 2012, which was dedicated to [[contemporary art]] in political contexts, "overcoming cultural chauvinism, implemented by the government", [[feminism]] and [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name="CreatedSite"&gt;''Own. inf.'' [http://artchronika.ru/news/19706/ New Site about Art and Politics] // ArtChronicles. – 2012. – December, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Stitch'' ===
Pavlensky first became known for [[lip sewing|sewing his mouth shut]] in political protest against the incarceration of members of the Russian punk group [[Pussy Riot]].&lt;ref name="ArtUnthinkableWithoutExperiment" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A. Mavliev, K. Akhmetjhanova'' [http://spb.kp.ru/online/news/1204927/ Artist sutured his mouth in support of Pussy Riot] // Komsomolskaya Pravda.  – 2012. – July, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''SobKor'' [http://ria.ru/society/20120723/707321040.html A Saint Petersburg artist sutured his mouth in support of Pussy Riot] // RIA News. – 2012. – July, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 23, 2012, Pavlensky appeared at [[Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg]] with his lips sewn up  holding a banner that stated, "Action of Pussy Riot was a replica of the famous action of Jesus Christ (Matthew 21:12–13)".&lt;ref name="ArtUnthinkableWithoutExperiment" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''SobKor'' [http://pravaya.ru/news/22782 Petersburg Peter Pavlensky sewed his mouth in support of punk parishioners] // pralaya.ru. – 2012. – July, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Police called an ambulance and sent him for a psychiatric examination; the psychiatrist declared him sane and released him shortly after the incident.&lt;ref name="SimpleIntersectionVertical"&gt;''A. Matveeva'' [http://artchronika.ru/persona/pavlensky-interview/ Petr Pavlensky: «A simple intersection of a vertical line with horizontal is already considered as an insult to the faith»] // artchronika.ru. – 2012. – July, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The artist stated that he was highlighting the lack of regard for artists in contemporary Russia,&lt;ref name="SimpleIntersectionVertical" /&gt; saying: "My intention was not to surprise anyone or come up with something unusual. Rather, I felt I had to make a gesture that would accurately reflect my situation."&lt;ref&gt;''V. Komarova.'' [http://www.echo.msk.ru/blog/publicpost/916475-echo/ With widely sutured mouth] // Echo of Moscow. – 2012. – Aug, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 14, 2012, [[Reuters]] published its list of the 98 best photos of the year which included a photograph of Pavlensky with his mouth sutured in support of Pussy Riot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.reuters.com/fullfocus/2012/11/30/best-photos-of-the-year-2012/#a=67 Artist Pyotr Pavlensky, a supporter of jailed members of the female punk band "Pussy Riot", looks on with his mouth sewed up as he protests outside the Kazan Cathedral in St. Petersburg, July 23, 2012.] // ''Best photos of the year 2012'', Reuters. – 2012. – November 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Carcass'' ===
On May 3, 2013, Pavlensky held a political protest against repressive government policies. His art performance was called ''Carcass''.&lt;ref name="VideoOfAction" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R. Moshkhoyev'' [http://www.kp.ru/online/news/1431470/ In St. Petersburg, the trial of "naked artist" has started] // Komsomolskaya Pravda. – 2013. – May, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; His assistants brought him naked, wrapped in a multilayered cocoon of [[barbed wire]], to the main entrance of the [[Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref name="VideoOfAction"&gt;''''[http://escap1sts.wordpress.com/2013/07/10/petr-pavlensky// Petr Pavlensky] // Escapist. – 2013. – July, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Stolyarchuk'' [http://www.colta.ru/docs/21554?fb_action_ids=538052092900753&amp;fb_action_types=og.recommends&amp;fb_source=other_multiline&amp;action_object_map={%22538052092900753%22%3A260476320763609}&amp;action_type_map={%22538052092900753%22%3A%22og.recommends%22}&amp;action_ref_map= St. Petersburg artist wrapped himself in the barbed wire] // www.colta.ru. – 2013. – May, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ActivistsExplainedNakedManNearLegislativeAss"&gt;''Own korr.'' [http://www.mr7.ru/articles/82932/ Activists explained of the naked man action near the Legislative Assembly building] // www.mr7.ru. – 2013. – May, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Own korr.'' [http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/580516/ Naked artist wrapped himself in the barbed wire near St. Petersburg Legislative Assembly Building] // НТВ. – 2013. – May, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The artist remained silent, lying still in a half-bent position inside the cocoon, and did not react to the actions of others until he was released by the police with the help of garden clippers. This performance was awarded the Alternative Prize for Russian Activist Art in the category Actions Implemented in Urban Space in 2013.&lt;ref name="Grani"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grani.ru/people/1866/|title=Peter Pavlensky, Saint Petersburg Artist|publisher=Grani.ru, Daily Internet Newspaper|date=October 28, 2013|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her interview with [[Radio Free Europe|Radio Liberty]], Pavlensky's colleague Oksana Shalygina mentioned that a metaphor of the action had its immediate realization in the reality: as soon as the barbed wire was cut off, and the artist was freed from it, the same exact wire wrapped him back in with police, ambulances and numerous field investigators.&lt;ref name="WeeklyReviewDVolchek"&gt;''D. Volchek.'' [http://www.svoboda.org/audio/broadcastprogram/729654.html Weekly Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110173616/http://www.svoboda.org/audio/broadcastprogram/729654.html |date=2013-11-10 }} // Radio Liberty. – 2013. – May, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Pavlensky made the following comment about his art work:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A series of laws aimed at suppressing civic activism, intimidation of the population, steadily growing number of political prisoners, the laws against NGOs, the 18+ laws, censorship laws, activity of [[Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media]], "promotion of homosexuality" laws  – all these laws aren't aimed against criminals, but against the people. And at last the [[Blasphemy law]]. That is why I organized this action. The human body is naked like a carcass, there is nothing on it except the barbed wire, which by the way was invented for the protection of livestock. These laws like the wire, keep people in individual pens: all this  persecution of political activists, [[Bolotnaya square case|"prisoners of May, 6"]], governmental repressions is the metaphor of the pen with the barbed wire around it. All this has been done in order to turn people into gutless and securely guarded cattle, which can only consume, work, and reproduce.: &lt;small&gt;Dmitry Volchek, "Cultural Diary: On Good Friday», Radio Liberty, May 8, 2013&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="On Good Friday"&gt;''D. Volchek'' [http://www.svoboda.org/content/article/24978110.html Cultural Diary: On Good Friday] // Radio Liberty. – 2013. – May, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Fixation'' ===
On November 10, 2013, while sitting naked on the stone pavement in front of the [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] on the [[Red Square]], Moscow, Pavlensky hammered a large nail through his [[scrotum]] affixing it to the stone pavement. His action coincided with the annual Russian Police Day. When the police arrived, they covered him with a blanket and later arrested him.&lt;ref&gt;AFP. {{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i0205mTMZyKYJ8qWksj8E9IBkYjg?docId=cb5ad566-dfc9-43fc-9a09-1b50be1706bc |title=Protester nails testicles to Red Square cobblestone}} November 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; "A naked artist, looking at his testicles nailed to the cobblestone is a metaphor of apathy, political indifference, and fatalism of Russian society," declared Pavlensky in his statement to the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsru.com/russia/10nov2013/pavlensky.html|title=Self-harming artist Pavlensky nailed his testicles to the Red Square|date=November 10, 2013|work=[[NEWSru.com]]|language=Russian|accessdate=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Freedom''===
On February 23, 2014, Pavlensky organized an action called ''Freedom'' in support of [[Euromaidan|Maidan]] and [[2014 Ukrainian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://slon.ru/posts/67581|title=Тело как оружие. Почему Петр Павленский неуязвим для власти|website=slon.ru|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist and his friends built an imitation [[barricade]] on [[Tripartite Bridge]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], burned tires, beat drums, and shouted Maidan slogans. The action was interrupted by Saint Petersburg police who arrested Pavlensky and his colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Художник Павленский и Ко устроили "Майдан" в центре Петербурга|url=http://www.mk.ru/social/article/2014/02/23/989021-hudozhnik-pavlenskiy-i-ko-ustroili-maydan-v-tsentre-peterburga.html|newspaper=[[Moskovsky Komsomolets]]|date=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Петр Павленский устроил "майдан" в центре Петербурга|url=http://www.fontanka.ru/2014/02/23/004/|newspaper=Fontanka|date=February 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Петр Павленский зажег покрышки у Спаса-на-Крови в поддержку Майдана|url=http://www.spb.aif.ru/politic/action/1111269|newspaper=[[Argumenty i Fakty]]|date=February 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 25, 2014, Dzerzhinsky Criminal Court stopped the administrative case against Pavlensky and his assistant Yaroslav Gradil ({{lang-ru|link=no|Ярослав Градиль}}) on the accusations of [[hooliganism]], and released them from prison. An investigation into Pavlensky's alleged violation of the regulations on political meetings continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Художнику Павленскому простили поджог покрышек|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/25/pavlensky/|newspaper=[[Lenta.ru]]|date=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was charged with vandalism due to the tire burning.&lt;ref name=MT150728&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/28/petr-pavlensky-artist-scrotum-red-square-interrogator |title=How Russia's 'most controversial artist' persuaded his interrogator to change sides |first= Ivan |last= Nechepurenko |work= [[The Moscow Times]] |publisher= guardian.co.uk |date= July 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Segregation''===
[[File:Петр павленский.jpeg|thumb|Pavlensky moments after self-harming. Moscow, October 2014.]]
On October 19, 2014, Pavlensky cut off his earlobe with a [[chef's knife]] while sitting naked on the roof of the infamous [[Serbsky Center]] to protest [[political abuse of psychiatry in Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://slon.ru/fast/russia/khudozhnik-pavlenskiy-otrezal-sebe-mochku-ukha-1173405.xhtml | script-title=ru:Художник Павленский отрезал себе мочку уха | publisher=Slon.ru | date=October 19, 2014 | accessdate=2014-10-19 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Lubyanka's burning door''===
Pavlensky came to the first entrance of the Lubyanka Building, which is the headquarters of the [[Federal Security Service|Russian Federal Security Service]] on November 9, 2015 at 1:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. Moscow time, and doused the front door with gasoline and set fire to it with a cigarette lighter. The doors of the building were partially burnt. Pavlensky was detained after 30 seconds without resistance, and charged with debauchery. A few hours after the action, a video appeared on the Internet with an explanation of the meaning of the burning. The action is called "Lubyanka's burning door" according to Pavlensky. The criminal case against Pavlensky was opened on November 9, 2015 under the "vandalism" section of article 214 of the Russian criminal code. On November 10, 2015 in the Tagansky district court, Pavlensky declared: "I want my action to be reclassified to terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/nov/09/pyotr-pavlensky-is-setting-russias-evil-history-ablaze|title=Pyotr Pavlensky is setting Russia's evil history ablaze|first=Jonathan|last=Jones|date=9 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to gallerist [[Marat Gelman]], the action shows Pavlensky's "obvious symbolism". "The Lubyanka door is the gate of hell, the entrance into the world of absolute evil. And against the backdrop of hellfire is a lonely artist, waiting to be captured ... Pavlensky's figure at the door of the FSB in flames - very important symbol for today's Russia, both political and artistic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpretermag.com/russia-update-november-10-2015/|title=Russia Update: FSB Seals Entrance of Lubyanka as Artist Pavlensky Awaits Determination of His Case|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 June 2016, the Moscow criminal court declared Pavlensky guilty and sentenced him to a fine of 500,000 rubles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://meduza.io/news/2016/06/08/pavlenskiy-prigovoren-k-shtrafu-v-500-tysyach-rubley-za-podzhog-dveri-fsb | title=Павленский приговорен к штрафу в 500 тысяч рублей за поджог двери ФСБ | publisher=meduza.io | accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 August 2016, Pavlensky gave a lecture in Odessa, Ukraine which ended with the inebriated Ukrainian journalist and screenwriter [[Vladimir Nestrenko]] instigating a fight that ended with his stabbing one of two security guards who tried to subdue him. The second of the two security guards suffered a fatal heart attack after the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davidzon|first1=Vladislav|title=Russian Conceptual Artist Petr Pavlensky Gives Sensational Lecture On Violent Political Art, Evening Ends With Lethal Brawl|url=http://odessareview.com/russian-conceptual-artist-petr-pavlenskys-gives-sensational-lecture-violent-political-art-evening-ends-lethal-brawl/|accessdate=16 August 2016|agency=The Odessa Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual assault allegations and leaving Russia for France ===
In the beginning of 2017, Pavlensky received asylum in France, after he fled Russia with his partner Oksana Shalygina and their children amid allegations of sexual assault. Pavlensky denied the allegations and said the investigation was politically motivated. Media in Russia reported that a young actress from Moscow theatre "Teatr.doc" had accused Pavlensky of sexually assaulting her. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/17/radical-protest-artist-pyotr-pavlensky-flees-from-russia-to-france#img-1 |title=Radical protest artist Pyotr Pavlensky flees from Russia to France |date=2017-01-17 |access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bank of France === 
On 16 October 2017, Pavlensky was arrested in Paris after setting on fire the entrance of an office of the [[Bank of France]], located on the [[Place des Victoires]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/exiled-russian-artist-torches-central-bank-branch-paris-114547388.html |title=Exiled Russian artist torches central bank branch in Paris |date=2017-10-16 |access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was charged with property damage, together with his partner Oksana Shalygina. He was initially detained in a psychiatric unit, until a judge ordered him to be placed in pretrial detention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/arts/pyotr-pavlensky-paris-fire.html |title=Russian Artist Is Charged Over Fire at Central Bank Building in Paris |last=Codrea-Rado |first=Anna |date=2017-10-19 |access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Group art exhibitions ==
In 2012, Pavlensky participated in the alumni and students art exhibition ''Oculus Two'' organized by Pro Arte Foundation.&lt;ref name="Oculus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proarte.ru/events/oculus-dva-vystavka-molodykh-khudozhnikov-fonda-pro-arte|title=Oculus Two: Exhibition of Young Artists of Pro Arte Foundation|publisher=St. Petersburg Pro Arte Foundation for Culture and Arts, Russia |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, in front of the [[Hermitage Museum|State Hermitage Museum]] in Saint Petersburg, he organized a street art exhibition ''Ghosts of Identity'', which came as a project of his ''Political Propaganda'' periodical.

== Awards ==
He was awarded the [[Václav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent]] in 2016. The Prize was later withdrawn after Pavlensky announced his intention to dedicate it (and its monetary award) to an insurgent group and then explicitly endorsed the use of violence as a valid method to combat government oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://humanrightsfoundation.org/programs/hrf-programs/2016-laureates|title=2016 Laureates|date=2016|publisher=Human Rights Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pavlensky was also nominated for Russia's "Innovation" art prize in 2016, but was later barred by the National Centre for Contemporary Art on the grounds that he had broken the law, prompting four members of the jury to leave in protest. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/24289908/Individual_agents_of_change_and_state_response_Performance_art_and_its_impact_in_contemporary_Russia|title=Individual agents of change and state response: Performance art and its impact in contemporary Russia|date=2016|publisher=Aliide Naylor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Made by Colin Torode, Lionheart replicas. Image by the Digital Pilgrim Project.''|alt=]]
'''Pilgrim badges''' were worn in the later [[medieval]] period by [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] pilgrims. Typically made of lead alloy, they were sold as souvenirs at sites of [[Christian pilgrimage]] and bear imagery relating to the saint venerated there. The production of pilgrim badges flourished in the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, particularly in the 14th and 15th centuries, but declined after the [[Protestant Reformation]] of the mid-16th century. Tens of thousands have been found since the mid-19th century, predominantly in rivers. Together they form the largest corpus of medieval art objects to survive to us today.

Pilgrimage sites housed a saint's [[relic]]s: sometimes the whole body, sometimes a body part or significant object owned or touched by the saint. For example, St [[Thomas Becket]] was martyred at [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in England in 1170 and his body remained there, becoming the epicentre of an enormously popular cult. In 1220 it was translated into a costly shrine. The pilgrim souvenirs associated with his cult have a particularly diverse array of imagery, including that of his shrine, his head [[reliquary]] and scenes from his life. Other major sites that produced badges were [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral|Santiago de Compostela]], [[Cologne Cathedral|Cologne]], Our Lady of Rocamadour and Jerusalem. Their badges bore images that were iconic and easily recognisable, such as the [http://www.spainisculture.com/en/obras_de_excelencia/museo_de_las_peregrinaciones/insignia_de_peregrino.html scallop shell], the [http://blog.museumoflondon.org.uk/journey-magi-three-kings-cologne-london/ Adoration of the Magi], the [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=49954&amp;partId=1&amp;place=39435&amp;plaA=39435-2-11&amp;page=8&amp;sortBy=&amp;view=list St Peter] or the [[Jerusalem cross|Jerusalem Cross]]. Shrines to the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin]] were common all over Christendom, as are badges associable with her.[http://collections.museumoflondon.org.uk/online/object/29149.html] They often show her holding the Infant Christ, or represent the first letter of her name.

== Origins ==
[[File:Ampulla Menas Louvre AF7035.jpg|thumb|4th-7th century clay pilgrim flask or ampulla. Pilgrims used ampullae like this to carry water or oil from the pilgrimage site for Saint Menas: a late-third-century Egyptian Roman soldier who was martyred for his Christian faith. He is shown between the two camels who returned his body to Egypt for burial]]
Various cultural practices converged to bring about the pilgrim badge. Pilgrims had long sought natural souvenirs from their destination to commemorate their trip and bring home some of the site's sanctity. The earliest and still iconic pilgrim 'badge' was the scallop shell worn by pilgrims to the shrine of [[Santiago de Compostela]]. Along with badges, vendors at holy sites sold [[ampulla]]e, small, tin vessels designed to carry holy water or oil from the site. The later metal examples derive from clay ampullae sold from the [[Early Middle Ages]] to pilgrims to the Holy Land and other sites in North Africa and the Middle East. These often bore images from the saint's life. The main vessel of the early ampullae from the shrine of St Thomas Becket is often textured to appear like a scallop shell, showing how flat, wearable signs and ampullae came to be conflated in the medieval imagination. Badges and ampullae were worn while travelling and allowed others to identify the wearer as a pilgrim and the saint they were visiting. They showed the wearer's special relationship with the saint and could be called upon in times of crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Push me, pull you.

==Manufacture and use==
[[File:Medieval pilgrim badge (FindID 482380).jpg|thumb|A medieval cast lead alloy monogram of Maria pilgrim badge. The badge is in the shape of a Lombardic 'm' with crown above. The crown is formed of three projections; the two outer projections are trefoil and the central is a single collared knop. The outline of the 'm' has a beaded border and in the gaps between the columns of the 'm' the casting seam can be seen. The reverse of the badge is plain; the catchplate has survived intact but only the stump of the pin remains]]
Pilgrim badges were cheaply mass-produced in bronze, cuttle-bone or limestone [[Molding (process)|moulds]] or, less frequently, by [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]-stamping.[https://sketchfab.com/models/c5eb876310be498c9a0a609cc309dfc0]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sketchfab.com/models/c5eb876310be498c9a0a609cc309dfc0|title=Digital Pilgrim 3D model of a Thomas Becket badge mould|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their easy reproducibility and modest media meant that everyone could afford them. British pilgrim badges often have an integral pin and clasp on the reverse whereas continental European badges more usually have sewing loops, but this is not a hard and fast rule. Pilgrims wore badges on their outer clothing and hats or around the neck to show where they had been on pilgrimage.  Some were designed to be fixed to the top of pilgrim staffs.[https://sketchfab.com/models/b7e217b5a8eb45f9b4c0ed64e2bff47e] Freshly cast, lead alloy is shiny and bright but it tarnishes rapidly.

To make thin, lead alloy badges, makers would have to create a eutectic alloy. Only at a specific ratio would lead and tin cast thin enough to make the most of the cheapest metal. The quality of pilgrim badges varied considerably, with some being naive and crudely made and others displaying great craftsmanship and skill. Ampullae, vessels for holy water or oil, were harder to make than badges, necessitating a process called [[Permanent mold casting|slush casting]]. Much rarer examples were made in precious metals for the wealthy; these have mostly been recycled for their valuable materials over the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-RdiayZt0QEC&amp;pg=PT1&amp;dq=pilgrim+badge+silver&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mkLkS-eGC5LWmQPB-JVN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pilgrim%20badge%20silver&amp;f=false Viewing Renaissance art]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the later Middle Ages, thin, precious metal badges were being produced that were perfectly designed for being sewn into books. Manuscripts survive with badges still in them, or imprints on the pages where they once were.[https://www.kb.nl/en/themes/middle-ages/more-from-the-middle-ages/book-of-hours-with-pilgrim-badges] It is often possible to identify the shrine from the imprint. As artists became increasingly fascinated by illusionism or the [[Trompe-l'œil|trompe l'oeil]] technique, representations of pilgrim badges painted into the margins of prayer books appear.[http://ica.themorgan.org/manuscript/page/49/77004]

The most popular shrines sold over 100,000 badges a year, making pilgrim badges the first mass-produced tourist souvenir. In 1520, the church at Regensbury sold over 120,000 badges to medieval pilgrims, after a drastic shortage the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Medieval Pilgrimage|last=Taylor, Craig, Friedman, Izbicki, Tekippe (eds.)|first=|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|page=522|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeology ==
Today, most pilgrim badges are recovered in or near rivers. Lynn Museum in Norfolk has a large collection of medieval badges that were collected in the 19th century by children, whom the local antiquarian would pay for their finds.[http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/view/NCC095925][https://www.thecollectionmuseum.com/assets/downloads/IS_arch_6_pilgrims_in_medieval_lincolnshire.pdf] It has been suggested that this is because medieval pilgrims believed that the badges would bring good luck if they were thrown into water, however that theory is now contested.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe/p/pilgrim_badge_depicting_st_geo.aspx Pilgrim badge depicting St George and the dragon in the] [[British Museum]]; J. Lee, Medieval pilgrims’ badges in rivers: the curious history of a non-theory, ''Journal of Art Historiography Number 11'' (2014) [https://arthistoriography.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/lee.pdf https://arthistoriography.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/lee.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the pilgrim badges in the collection of [[The Salisbury Museum|Salisbury Museum]] were found when the town's medieval sewers were excavated. This, among other evidence, suggests they were eventually just thrown away.

== Imagery ==
[[File:Becket-pilgrim-badge.jpg|thumb|This badge represents the ornate head reliquary of St Thomas Becket and was probably sold near his shrine in Canterbury]]
Studying the imagery of pilgrim badges quickly leads to an ability to identify the shrine or saint associated with them. For example, [[Thomas Becket|St Thomas of Canterbury]] is often shown being martyred by one of a group of four knights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sketchfab.com/models/7dd81a87e34644f3a0e50aaaf61cad44|title=3D model of a Canterbury pilgrim ampulla:|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iconography of the [[Scallop#Shell of Saint James|scallop shell associated with pilgrimages]] along the [[Way of St James]] to the shrine of [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]] at [[Santiago de Compostela]] in modern Spain derived from shells collected by pilgrims on the beach. The relic of [[John the Baptist|St John the Baptist]]'s head, which was famously venerated at Amiens, is shown as a face on a plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sketchfab.com/models/e761b7bbfac94c1d9c49b55e46586fb1|title=3D model of an Amiens pilgrim souvenir:|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The images are frequentlty related to iconographic types found on monumental artwork, showing how mobile iconographies were across media and social spheres.

Badges were made in the Middle Ages for purposes beyond pilgrim souvenirs; [[livery badge]]s were presented to employees and allies by great figures, and became highly controversial in the decades leading to the [[Wars of the Roses]].  Some political badges have survived, including a fine one for the [[Black Prince]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/f/funerary_badge_black_prince.aspx British Museum badge of the Black Prince]

&lt;/ref&gt;  Other badges, with motifs such as lovers' tokens and mini brooches, were perhaps a form of cheap jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sketchfab.com/models/e8644b481aa7494d92c9ce9c9998b9c9|title=3D model of a medieval lover's token inscribed 'Herte be Trewe'|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Erotic badges showing winged phalluses or vulvas dressed as pilgrims are prolific, although their cultural significance is still debated.[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=49050&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=phallus+medieval+badge+&amp;page=1] Gazing at a collection of pilgrim souvenirs and medieval badges is to gain an insight into the visual world of medieval Christendom.

In England the tradition of making and wearing pilgrim badges died out in the early 16th century as pilgrimage initially declined in popularity and was then banned completely as the country became [[Protestantism|Protestant]] during the [[English Reformation]], when pilgrimage became regarded as a [[superstition]] and [[Idolatry|idolatrous]]. However, the tradition continued in Catholic Europe, in some cases to the present day.

A '''remix service''' is a service (company or organization) that provides [[remix]]ed music to [[disc jockey]]s.

==History==
In the United States, the [[disco]] craze of the late 1970s led to the release of extended "disco" versions of songs, most of which were released on [[12-inch single|12" vinyl singles]]. Many of these were not easily [[Beatmixing|beatmixed]], so DJs started to laboriously edit songs by splicing [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] tape copies, making their own, unique versions that were better structured for a dancefloor.

1977 saw the creation of the first remix service, Disconet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.djsportal.com/en/pioneer/index.php?id=disconet| title=Disconet Story| work=DjsPortal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These companies gathered DJs and producers together to create monthly, promotional-only compilation albums containing re-edits, remixes, or [[List of musical medleys|medleys]] that were intended specifically for club DJs.

By 1994, there was a saturation of remix services, most of which typically remixed the same tracks as their competitor. At that point, the RIAA got involved and began notifying remix services that they needed to have clear permission from publishers or face litigation. Coincidentally, the services that survived the fallout (Ultimix, X-mix, Hot Tracks, Wicked Mix) all featured remixers that currently had radio mix-shows. In exchange for allowing remixing of certain tracks, remixers could be counted on by the labels to help "break" the new song they were trying to promote by featuring the track heavily in their mix-show.

While some services decided to ultimately cease operations, mixes began to pop up at most DJ record shops. It should be noted that an effort was made by one of the larger services to clear a way for all services to become legal. The idea was for every service to pay either a flat fee or a percentage of sales to a commission who would then allocate the money to the publishers whose tracks were used. This idea was rebuffed by the labels.

==Modern mixes==
Over the years, the remixes featured on these compilations have varied from simple edits, adding a mixable intro and outro to a song, or full-fledged, digital, multi-track remixes that barely resemble the original track. Many remix services have focused on a specific style of music (such as [[hip-hop]] or [[rock (music)|rock]]) or type of remix (such as [[house music|house]] mixes of pop hits).

As of 2006, there have been over 50 official remix services worldwide with at least as many spinoffs, although most of these companies (including Disconet) have long since folded due to financial or legal reasons. All remix services are required to get the original [[record label]] or artists' permission to edit and release a track, but many bootleg services exist that do not.

==Distribution==
Most of these companies required a DJ subscription agreement to buy the records or CDs, and each issue was typically limited in quantity from 100 to several thousand. Many of these compilations have become sought after collectors items as a result. Once in a while a remix service version of a song is released commercially by the artist's record label, but 99% of remix service mixes are sold only to DJs on the compilations.

==Notable companies==
Some of these companies helped launch the careers of many well-known remixers/producers.

[[Chris Cox (DJ)|Chris Cox]] (formerly of [[Thunderpuss]]) worked for [[Hot Tracks (remix service)|Hot Tracks]] (now Select Mix). [[Armand Van Helden]] created mixes for Mega-Mixx and X-Mix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xmix.com| title=XMix.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Markus Schulz]], [[C. L. McSpadden]] and [[Aaron Scofield|Aaron "The Pimp" Scofield]] made mixes for Powerhouse - after the company folded Scofield and McSpadden offered remixes through Culture Shock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myspace.com/cultureshockremix| title=About Culture Shock| work=CultureShockRemix.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Schulz releases remixes and original compositions through his own Coldharbour Recordings label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.markusschulz.com| title=MarkusSchulz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Liebrand]] released numerous remixes with DMC. A few companies/artists besides Schulz have also developed their own commercial record labels to release new tracks.

The UK-based DMC remix service probably has the most members in the world, with offices in nearly every country, and that they sponsor the yearly World DJ Championships as well as releasing many commercial compilations.

==Megamixes==
Many remix services issues also contain [[megamix]]es. A megamix contains multiple songs mixed together, sometimes in rapid succession. They can consist of a single artist (just [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] songs, etc.) or multiple artists. Some may follow a theme as well (Christmas, only songs that have "queen" in the title, only [[David Morales (Disc Jockey)|David Morales]] mixes, etc.). Often megamixes are also called medleys.

Megamixes are also commonly found on commercial releases, sometimes using the same mix previously released to DJs on a remix service. The earlier [[Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers|Jive Bunny &amp; The Mastermixers]] series of 50s and 60s megamixes were originally released on the [[Music Factory]] Mastermix service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mastermixdj.com/paris/frameset.asp|title=MasterMix.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617185030/http://www.mastermixdj.com/paris/frameset.asp|archivedate=2008-06-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among modern services, Ultimix is well known for producing several megamixes every year based on popular songs of the year ("flashback medleys") as well as some single artist megamixes. Culture Shock has the "Hit "AC" Megamixes" on their main series derived from their now defunct [[Radio programming|radio show]], as well as a satellite series entitled "Use Alternative Routes" which contains [[Modern rock|Modern Rock]] megamixes. Similarly, the UK-based DMC and Music Factory Mastermix remix services frequently include megamixes on their issues.

}}
'''Resort wear''' is a clothing style, as well as a year-round fashion "season". Sometimes known as "cruise wear", it was collections only to very affluent customers who were expected to spend the post-Christmas/New Year's weeks in warm-weather climates.

More recently, designers, store buyers, and the media are viewing "resort wear" as a specialized year-round clothing style and fashion season. There are some important reasons for this. Areas such as [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Marbella, Spain|Marbella]], [[Bahamas]], [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]], [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], and the [[Caribbean|San Barth and the Mustique]] Islands were holiday destinations, but they are now places of year-round living for more affluent customers. From the spectacular resort destinations of [[Dubai]], South Africa and Thailand, to the Spanish Coast, Costa Rica and the Greek Islands, resort wear popularity is growing and it is not surprising to see Hawaiian shirts being worn on the Mexican Riviera. It has become a cross-cultural style that signifies relaxation, affluence, and appreciation of nature which displays a sense of style to the wearer.

From walking shorts, [[caftan]]s and [[sandals]], to full-length [[evening gown|evening dresses]] for women and light [[dinner jacket]]s for men, resort wear is unique in its design and function.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Resort wear is generally made from [[cotton]], [[silk]], [[denim]], [[microfiber]], straw and [[poplin]] that are easy to pack, lightweight and breathable. They are easy to clean and look great without ironing or fuss, much like the new hair styles that are casual, yet very fashionable.

It is characterized by the "nautical" style, inspired by sailor and yachting themes, classic Hawaiian prints of palm trees and hula girls, brushed [[denim]] from [[San Francisco]], bright floral prints from South America, minty greens, yellows, blues and whites from the Mediterranean and natural materials and glove-weight leathers from the Caribbean. Large hats, sunglasses, open-toed shoes and innovative waistlines complete the look of sun-soaked destinations. The style has already been the subject of small runway shows in New York, Paris and Milan.

Though designers and design houses as [[J. Crew]], [[Banana Republic (clothing retailer)|Banana Republic]], [[Lilly Pulitzer]], and [[Tommy Bahama]] have pioneered the style, other leading designers are now creating resort wear. [[Chanel]], [[Oscar de la Renta]], [[Michael Kors]], [[Rachel Zoe]], [[John Galliano]], [[Matthew Williamson]], [[Anna Sui]], [[Prada]], [[Marc Jacobs]] and many other designers have shown resort wear in their collections.

'''Rose Kerr''' (born February 1953) is an English art historian specializing in [[Chinese art]], especially [[Chinese ceramics]], on which she has written a number of books. She was the Keeper of the Far Eastern Department at the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] in London until 2003. In 2015, she was made an honorary citizen of Jingdezhen, China, the historic centre of Chinese porcelain production, in recognition of her academic research on Jingdezhen ceramics, and her promotion of [[cultural exchange]] between the United Kingdom and China. She was the first non-Chinese citizen to be so honoured.

==Early life==
Rose Kerr was born in February 1953. She graduated in Chinese studies from the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] in London,&lt;ref name=gbcc/&gt; and was one of a handful of British students to live and study in China during the last year of the [[Cultural Revolution]] in 1975-1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hand grenade practice in Peking: my part in the Cultural Revolution|last=Wood|first=Frances.|publisher=Penguin|year=2000|isbn=978-0719557811|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nzchinasociety.org.nz/28234/nelson-branch-newsletter-no-10-november-2016/ November meeting ~ ~ The Cultural Revolution through English eyes ~ Friday 25 November, 5:30 p.m.] Nelson Branch Newsletter No. 10 – November 2016, New Zealand China Friendship Society. Retrieved 9 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Kerr was Keeper of the Far Eastern Department at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum&lt;ref&gt;[http://royalasiaticsociety.org/dr-rose-kerr-on-zhenwu-the-dark-warrior-daoist-beliefs-and-imagery-in-china/ Dr Rose Kerr on Zhenwu, the Dark Warrior: Daoist beliefs and imagery in China.] Ed Weech, Royal Asiatic Society, 29 September 2016. Retrieved 9 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; until her retirement in 2003.&lt;ref name=gbcc/&gt;

Her work with professor [[Nigel Wood]], ''Science and Civilisation in China Vol. 5 Part 12: Ceramic Technology'' ( {{ISBN|0521838339}}) is a major contribution to the seminal series of works on Chinese science begun by [[Joseph Needham]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The volume on Ceramic Technology is a work of almost one thousand pages. It synthesises information derived from historic texts, archaeological excavation and the principles of ceramic science.It covers the formation of clays and their relation to the underlying geologies of China, firing, manufacturing methods and sequences, glazes, pigments and gilding, and the impact of Chinese ceramic technology around the world from the 7th century onwards. The volume was unique in its coverage, and is a definitive source book for researchers.

Her book ''Later Chinese Bronzes'', ( {{ISBN|1870076117}}), published by the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1990, broke new ground in the study of Chinese bronzes, and remains an important work of reference.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Based on the collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum, the book explored a subject which was at that time new to art history, namely the identification, dating and use of bronze vessels made in the Song-Qing dynasties.

She is honorary associate of the [[Needham Research Institute]] at [[Cambridge University]], and an honorary fellow at the [[University of Glasgow]]. She is a former chairman, and currently a trustee, of the Great Britain-China Education Trust;&lt;ref name=gbcc&gt;{{cite web|title=GBCC Trust Chairman becomes Honorary Citizen of Jingdezhen|url=http://www.gbcc.org.uk/news/gbcc-trust-chairman-becomes-honorary-citizen-of-jingdezhen.aspx|website=Great Britain China Centre|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Trustee of the [[Percival David Foundation of Chinese Art]]; and Museum Expert Advisor for the Hong Kong Government. She is a former president of the [[Oriental Ceramic Society]] of London (2000-2003).{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Kerr visits Asia frequently and has undertaken sabbaticals at the [[National Palace Museum]], Taipei, and the [[Shanghai Museum]]. She has taught at the universities of London, Sussex, Glasgow, and Oslo, and was a lecturer for the UK National Association of Decorative and Fine Art Societies for many years.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Honours==
In 2015, Kerr was created an honorary citizen of [[Jingdezhen]], China, the [[Jingdezhen porcelain|historic centre]] of [[Chinese porcelain]] production,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.martinrandall.com/dr-rose-kerr-porcelain Dr Rose Kerr becomes honorary citizen of China's porcelain capital.] Martin Randall Travel, 11 November 2015.

}}There are several '''gold girdles of Korea''' which have been excavated.  They are symbols of royalty but lesser belts were worn by governmental officials.  These belts have been found in the tombs of both [[Silla]] and [[Baekje]] kings and queens and the lesser nobility.  The lesser girdles can be distinguished based on their size, material used, and color.  All royal girdles follow a general scheme.  The royal girdles are made from pure gold metal plates attached to one another and are adorned with many charms, such as [[gogok]].  The symbolism of these charms and their significance are not yet fully ascertained.  The practice of wearing girdles probably derives from Chinese traditions.

[[Image:Korea-National.Folk.Museum-01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Both the king and queen are wearing gold girdles.  The queen's belt prominently displays the oval chain of ''yopae''.  The king's girdle contains charms of [[gogok]] and other ornaments.]]

==National Treasure No. 88==
'''Geumgwanchong gwadae mit yopae''' ([[hangul]] 금제과대 [[hanja]] 金製과帶) (Girdle and pendants from Geumgwanchong) was designated as the 88th [[National treasures of Korea|national treasure of Korea]] on December 20, 1962.  This girdle was found in the [[Gold Crown Tomb]] and is of Silla provenance.  It is currently housed at the [[Gyeongju National Museum]].

==National Treasure No. 190==
'''Cheonmachong geumje gwadae''' ([[hangul]] 천마총금제과대 [[hanja]] 天馬塚金製과帶) (Gold girdle with pendants from Cheonmachong) was excavated from the [[Heavenly Horse Tomb]] and was designated as the 190th national treasure of Korea on December 7, 1978.  This girdle is also housed at the Gyengju National Museum and is of Silla provenance

This golden belt is 125 centimeters in length and is made from 44 metal rectangles.  Leather or metal rings were inserted to link the belt through nine holes in the girdle.  Hanging from the girdle are numerous charms, the symbolic meaning of these charms are still in question.  However, the charms may originate from Chinese traditions of formality from the book, Yegi.  The charms on the left of the belt include jade comma-shaped [[gogok]], a small knife, a case for medicines, a whetstone, a flint, and tweezers.  These charms match the objects needed to perform the ancestral rites based on Chinese tradition.  The charms hanging on the right side of the belt include bone instruments worn on the thumb for use in archery, an instrument used to suspend the bow string, and a cup.

Also attached to the girdle is the ''Yopae'' which is 22.5 to 73.5 centimeters in length.  This ornament is a chain of thirteen oval-like and quadrangle-like gold plates.

Both the girdle itself and the ''Yopae'' were found worn on the waist of the person interred in the Heavenly Horse Tomb.

==National Treasure No.192==
'''Geumjegwadae''' ([[hangul]] 금제과대 [[hanja]] 金製과帶) (Gold girdle with pendants from north mound of Tumulus No.98) was designated on December 7, 1978 as the 192nd national treasure of Korea.

This belt is 120 centimeters in length, is made of pure gold and consists of 28 metal rectangles interlinked together.  Like National Treasure No.190, this belt holds a number of charms on its left side including comma-shaped jadeite beads, a knife, a case for drugs, a whetstone, a flint, and tweezers which correspond the tools required for honoring the ancestors according to the Yegi, a book on the lessons of formality.  On the right the charms on the belt are a bone instrument worn on the thumb for use in archery, a tool used to suspend bow strings in archery, and a cup.

The girdle was also found with the ''Yopae'', a gold chain of 13 oval and rectangular metal plates which was attached to the main belt of the girdle via a hinge.  It is about 22.5 to 73.5 centimeters in length.  The ''Yopae'' is important because it gives clues as to how the girdle was actually worn and used.

Tomb No.98, also known as Hwangnamdaechong, is part of the ancient tomb complex of Michuwangneung District and is the largest tomb made during the Silla dynasty. ([[Michu of Silla|King Michu]]'s tomb, Silla Dynasty).  The tomb is dated to be before Silla unified Korea in 688 CE.  The tumulus was excavated twice, once in 1973 and once in 1975 and is 80 meters in diameter measured from east to west, and 120 meters in diameter from north to south.  The tomb is a double mound and is shaped like a gourd.  The south entrance is 23 meters in height and the north entrance is 22 meters in height.  There is significant controversy over the identity of the people buried in the north and south tomb.  The golden girdle found in this tomb may have been for a Silla queen because there was a plaque found in the tomb which indicated that the belt was for a woman.  However, no Silla queen was recorded that matches the date of the tomb so there is still debate over who and their gender was buried in the north mound and south mound.

==Treasure No.629==
'''Geumjegwadaemityopae''' ([[hangul]] 금제과대 [[hanja]] 金製과帶) (Gold girdle with pendants from south mound of Tumulus No.98) is a lesser gold belt found in the South mound of Tomb No.98.  It is housed at the Gyeongju National Museum and is of Silla manufacture.

This belt is 99 centimeters in total length.  The short waist plate is 18 to 22 centimeters in length while the long waist plate measures at 79.5 centimeters in length.  The belt, like other Korean girdles, is made up square plates.  This belt has engravings on the belt and also has 34 leaf-like ornaments.  This girdle only holds seven charms.  Six dangle close to the belt while one charm hangs lower, the ''Yopae''.  The shorter charms include a symbol of a fish and three comma-shaped beads ([[gogok]]).  This belt also has clasps on both ends which is apparently a distinguishing feature from other gold girdles.  The belt is less grand than its counterpart in the north mound of Tomb No.98 and was probably not worn by a king or queen of Silla.

[[Richard Strauss]] composed his '''Symphony No. 1''' in [[D minor]] (TrV 94) in 1880 when he was just 16 years old. It consists of four movements, and lasts about 34 minutes. Although Strauss did not give a number to the [[symphony]], it is often referred to as his First Symphony. It was premiered on 30 March 1881 at the [[Munich Academy of Music]] under the baton of [[Hermann Levi]].

==Composition history==

Strauss completed his musical studies with his composition teacher, Friedrich Wilhelm Meyer, in February 1880 (he was a conductor and had been hired as a private teacher by Richard's father [[Franz Strauss]] since 1875). Strauss wrote the symphony whilst attending school, from 12 March to 12 June 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Schuh, page 48.&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote to his mother "I'm getting on all right at school, the symphony is making jolly good progress, all four movements are finished now. I've scored the Scherzo and almost all of the first movement".&lt;ref&gt;Schuh, page 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The four movements are:

*I. Andante Maestoso – Allegro Vivace.
*II. Andante
*III. Scherzo: Molto allegro, leggiero – Trio.
*IV. Finale: Allegro Maestoso.

Scott Warfield wrote that "the symphony in D minor follows the same formal plans that Strauss had been studying for nearly five years. The outer movements are real [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro]] movements, now complete with true [[Musical development|development]] sections. The slow movement draws on the same model and the [[Scherzo]] follows the standard [[binary form]]."&lt;ref&gt;Warfield, page 201.&lt;/ref&gt; The first movement opens with a fifty bar slow introduction, laying out thematic material used later.  As Werbeck notes, within this introduction, Strauss goes through a series of [[Modulation (music)|modulations]] in which one two-bar theme is repeated in a sequence from D min, Bflat7, Eflat, B7, Emin, C, Fmin, Dflat, ending in F. This wondering [[tonality]] is in contrast to the otherwise conservative musical conception of the symphony, and perhaps prefigures the future Strauss.&lt;ref&gt;Werbeck, page XII.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Exposition (music)|exposition]] starts with a shift to 3/4, and  the transition uses thematic material both from the first theme and the introduction. "This opening movement also contains the first genuine development section in any symphonic work by Strauss. His technique for development in this lengthy subsection (188 bars) consists primarily repeating the material...as it sequences through various harmonic levels. This section marks the first time that Strauss went beyond the safety of a codified formal plan".&lt;ref&gt;Warfield, page 201-2.&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of sixteen, Strauss was writing a symphony which "need not be excused as a "student" work".&lt;ref&gt;Warfield, page 203.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[David Hurwitz (music critic)|David Hurwitz]] notes, Strauss had a rare mastery of orchestration and in particular writing for woodwind:  "Colorful scoring that captivates the ear and never fatigues or bores the listener makes a work sound shorter than it really is, even one that has a rather stiff little fugue in the middle of its finale, as does the First Symphony."&lt;ref&gt;Hurwicz, page 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

These more recent views contrast with [[Norman Del Mar]], who stated in his 1962 study that "...the symphony is essentially a student work. It is nevertheless well made and has several interesting ideas."&lt;ref&gt;Del Mar, page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance history==
[[Image:Hermann Levi conductor.jpg|thumb|150px|Hermann Levi who conducted the premier]]

The premiere was given at the [[Odeon (Munich)|Odeon concert hall]] in Munich as part of the subscription concert series of the Academy of music on 30 March 1881.  The conductor was Hermann Levi, who was the musical director of the [[Bavarian State Opera|Munich Court opera]] from 1872–1896, and who was to premiere [[Richard Wagner]]'s [[Parsifal]] in 1882.

Strauss' father Franz was much involved in the premiere, copying out all of the orchestral parts by hand and playing in the orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;Schuh, page 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Franz was so grateful to Levi for conducting the premiere, he asked how he could thank him. Levi "promptly seized the chance to ask the great horn-player to take part in the first performances of [[Parsifal]] at the [[Bayreuth festival]] in 1882". Despite his hostility to the works of [[Richard Wagner]], Franz consented, taking his son Richard with him to the see Parsifal at Bayreuth.&lt;ref&gt;Schuh, page 52-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The reviews of the premier were very positive, with the ''Muechner Neueste Nachritten'' of 3 April 1880 reporting that: &lt;blockquote&gt; The third of the Musical Academies subscription concerts included one new work, a symphony in D minor by Richard Strauss. The recent performance of his String quartet had already drawn our attention to the significant talent possessed by this young composer. The symphony, too, shows considerable competence in the treatment of the form as well as remakable skill in orchestration. It must be said that the work cannot lay claim to any true originality, but it demonstrates throughout a fertile musical imagination, to which composition comes easily.&lt;ref&gt;Schuh, page 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The piece was later performed on 5 August 1893 by the amateur ''Wilden Gung'l'' orchestra conducted by his father [[Franz Strauss]] and with whom Richard had briefly played in the violins.&lt;ref&gt;Trenner, page 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Although father Franz wanted to have more performances of the symphony, to build on its initial success, son Richard Strauss had moved on and rejected it "as unsuitable for further performance"&lt;ref&gt;Del Mar, page 22.&lt;/ref&gt; He gave the Wilden Gung'l orchestra the autograph score of the symphony along with the exclusive rights to perform the piece.&lt;ref&gt;Wihelm, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the symphony has rarely been performed.

There exists very few recordings of the piece.

[[Mily Balakirev]] began work on his '''Symphony No. 2 in D minor''' in 1900, but did not complete the work until 1908.  The premiere of the symphony was conducted by Russian composer [[Sergei Liapunov]], a student of Balakirev, in St. Petersburg in 1909.  Another performance was held in Paris soon afterwards, but the piece has since become one of the lesser known symphonies in the repertoire.

The work features a standard, four-movement structure:

# Allegro ma non troppo
# Scherzo alla Cosacca: Allegro non troppo, ma con fuoco ed energico
# Romanza: Andante
# Finale: Tempo di Polacca

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6960">The '''Symphony in B minor "Polonia"''', Op. 24, was written by [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]] between 1903 and 1908, and first publicly performed in 1909. Although he lived for another 32 years, the symphony was virtually Paderewski's last composition; he wrote only one more work before his death in 1941 - a hymn for male chorus in 1917. Around 1910, he commenced what would become a political career, culminating in becoming the first Prime Minister of independent Poland and signing the [[Treaty of Versailles]] on behalf of his nation in 1919. He later returned to the concert platform as a virtuoso pianist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/dept/polish_music/composer/paderewski.html Polish Music Center] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826072003/http://www.usc.edu/dept/polish_music/composer/paderewski.html |date=2012-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paderewski started sketching the Symphony in B minor in his home near [[Morges]] in [[Switzerland]] in 1903. The work was completed in 1908 and was given a private performance in [[Lausanne]] on 26 December 1908.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt; Its public premiere was with the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] under the German conductor [[Max Fiedler]],&lt;ref&gt;One source, IMSLP, says the conductor was [[Serge Koussevitzky]], but this seems to be an error.&lt;/ref&gt; on 12 February 1909. It was soon performed in Paris under [[André Messager]], and in London under [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]].&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt;&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; The symphony had its Polish premiere in January 1911, where it was presented to celebrate the centenary of the birth of [[Frédéric Chopin]], conducted by Paderewski's devoted friend [[Henryk Opieński]].&lt;ref name=grove&gt;[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians |Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]], 5th ed, 1954, Vol. VI, p. 482, Paderewski, Ignacy (Jan)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt; It also had performances in Philadelphia, New York and Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paderewskifest.com/about_paderewski.html paderewskifest.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219072546/http://www.paderewskifest.com/about_paderewski.html |date=2012-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has had little concert exposure since that time. To mark the 70th anniversary of the composer's death, it was performed in June 2011 at the Polish Presidential Palace under the patronage of [[President of Poland|President]] [[Bronisław Komorowski]], by [[Sinfonia Varsovia]] under [[Jerzy Maksymiuk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenews.pl/1/11/Artykul/46745,Poland-marks-Paderewski-70-year-death-anniversary thenews.pl, 29 June 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; (Maksymiuk made the first Western un-cut recording of the work in 1998.)

"Polonia" is in three movements, although Paderewski originally planned a four-movement work, which would have included a [[scherzo]].&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt; As it is, the three movements he did write take about 75 minutes to perform, which extraordinary length has often caused it (particularly the finale) to be cut in performance and recording.

The three movements are:
* ''Adagio maestoso - Allegro vivace'' (30')
* ''Andante con moto'' (17')
* ''Vivace'' (27').

It is often described as a [[Program music|programme symphony]], the three movements depicting:
* the glorious days of Poland of the past
* Poland of the present day (1907), at the nadir of political subjugation
* the approach of a happier future for Poland.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

The inspiration for the title "Polonia" seems to be a series of eight ‘cartoons’ published under that title in 1863 by [[Artur Grottger]], depicting the grim realities of everyday life and struggle under Russian occupation. Grottger's "Polonia" was a response to the failed insurrection of 1863-65 known as the [[January Uprising]].&lt;ref name=thomas&gt;[http://www.adrianthomasmusic.com/about/CD_IJP_HYP_98.html adrianthomasmusic.com]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paderewski initially intended to dedicate the work to the 40th anniversary of that event,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2003/dec03/Paderewski_Polonia.htm Music Web International]&lt;/ref&gt; in which his own father was caught up and even arrested, but no such dedication appears in the score.

The music is expansive and discursive, not sticking closely to any pre-determined form. This quality has attracted comment that Paderewski seems to often lose his way, and also overdevelops his themes.

It is lush and romantic in texture, leading to comparisons with the music of [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]],&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt; [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/july99/polonia.htm Music Web International]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]], [[Alexander Glazunov|Glazunov]], [[Mily Balakirev|Balakirev]], [[Nikolai Myaskovsky|Myaskovsky]], [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold|Korngold]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2003/dec03/Paderewski_Polonia.htm Music Web International]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reinhold Glière|Glière]],&lt;ref name=amaz1/&gt; [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Richard Strauss]], and even a precursor of [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]].&lt;ref name=amaz1&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Paderewski-Symphony-Maksymiuk-Ignace-Jan/product-reviews/B00000G3ZC/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1&amp;sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending Amazon]&lt;/ref&gt;

The score very unusually calls for three [[sarrusophone]]s, a [[tambour de Basque]], a [[thunder sheet]] and an [[Organ (music)|organ]]. The full instrumentation is: piccolo, 3 flutes, 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets in A, bass clarinet in A, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns in F, 4 trumpets in F, 3 trombones, tuba, 3 contrabass sarrusophones in E{{flat}}, timpani, percussion (triangle, cymbals, tambourine, bass drum, tambour de Basque, tam-tam, glockenspiel, bells, thunder sheet), harp, organ and strings.&lt;ref name=IMSLP&gt;[http://imslp.org/wiki/Symphony,_Op.24_(Paderewski,_Ignacy_Jan) IMSLP]&lt;/ref&gt;

The finale contains a disguised [[musical quotation|quotation]] of the Polish [[national anthem]], ''[[Poland Is Not Yet Lost|Jeszcze Polska nie zginęła]]'' (''Poland Is Not Yet Lost''), in [[duple meter]] rather than the original's triple-time [[mazurka]] rhythm.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt;

In 1915, [[Edward Elgar]] wrote an orchestral piece titled ''[[Polonia (Elgar)|Polonia]]'', Op. 76, which he dedicated to Paderewski.

'''''The Hatchet Man''''' (1932) is a [[Pre-Code Hollywood|pre-Code film]] directed by [[William A. Wellman]] and starring [[Edward G. Robinson]]. [[Warner Bros.]] had purchased the [[David Belasco]]/[[Achmed Abdullah]] play ''The Honorable Mr. Wong'' about the [[Tong (organization)|Tong]] gang wars. Made during the few years before strict enforcement of the [[Production Code]], ''The Hatchet Man'' has elements that would not be allowed later, such as adultery, [[narcotics]], and a somewhat graphic use of a flying hatchet.

==Plot summary==
Wong Low Get (Edward G. Robinson) is the most highly respected hatchet man of his [[Tong (organization)|Tong]]. Having sworn total allegiance, he cannot turn down an order, even one to kill his best friend Sun Yat Ming ([[J. Carrol Naish]]). His friend forgives him in advance of his execution, begging only that Wong raise his daughter Toya San (Loretta Young) as his own. Wong does as he has sworn, but as she grows up, he falls in love with her. She marries him out of a sense of obligation, but a handsome younger gangster, Harry En Hai (Leslie Fenton), gets her to leave Wong, disgracing him and leading to a shocking turn of events.

As was typical of the time, almost no Asian actors appear in the cast of a film set completely among Chinese characters. Makeup artists had noticed that audiences were more likely to reject Western actors in Asian disguise if the faces of actual Asians were in near proximity. Rather than cast the film with all Asian actors, which would have then meant no star names to attract American audiences, studios simply eliminated most of the Asian actors from the cast. That said, this film contains a number of Asian actors in minor roles, including [[Toshia Mori]] and [[Willie Fung]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C03E6D91E3FE633A25757C0A9649C946394D6CF Movie Review, The Greeks Had a Word for Them (1932) - Edward G.

==Tim Hetherington Visionary Award==
In 2014 the Trust founded the Visionary Award for innovation in visual storytelling. It awards £20,000 and a mentor to one artist or duo to work on their proposed project. It seeks to encourage artists and journalists whose work crosses the boundaries of art, reportage and technology to innovate in terms of Hetherington's goal of "how do we use media in a way that is really effective?".&lt;ref name="padley-bjp-trust" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bjp-162"&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2015 | title = Tim Hetherington Visionary Award | periodical = [[British Journal of Photography]] | volume = 162 | issue = 7834 | pages = 12, 13 | publisher = Incisive Financial Publishing Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://time.com/3692898/tim-hetherington-trust-unveils-visionary-award-shortlist/ | date = 3 February 2015 | access-date = 8 October 2015 | first = Olivier | last = Laurent | magazine = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | title = Tim Hetherington Trust Unveils Visionary Award Shortlist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/photos/2015/02/tim-hetherington-trust-finalists | first = David | last = Friend | access-date = 8 October 2015 | publisher = [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] | title = Showcasing the Finalists for the Award to Honor Tim Hetherington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Time Pyramid''''' ({{lang-de|Zeitpyramide}}) is a work of [[public art]] by Manfred Laber under construction in [[Wemding]], [[Germany]]. The [[pyramid]], begun in 1993, at the 1,200th anniversary of Wemding, will take almost another 1,166 years to complete and is scheduled to be finished in the year 3183. As of {{CURRENTYEAR}}, the first {{Str number/trim|{{#expr:({{CURRENTYEAR}} - 1983) / 10}}}} of its scheduled 120 concrete blocks have been placed.&lt;ref name="Conception"&gt;[http://www.zeitpyramide.de/ Conception] Official ''Zeitpyramide'' website, accessed: 14 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portal-vg-wemding.de/wemding/Content?do=doSide&amp;action=content&amp;mandant=1&amp;id=36&amp;lev=3&amp;parent=3&amp;hauptmenue=0&amp;sideid=52 ''Die Stadt der Zeitpyramide''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719073112/http://www.portal-vg-wemding.de/wemding/Content?do=doSide&amp;action=content&amp;mandant=1&amp;id=36&amp;lev=3&amp;parent=3&amp;hauptmenue=0&amp;sideid=52 |date=2011-07-19 }} (The city of the time pyramid) {{de icon}} Official Wemding website, accessed: 14 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The town of Wemding dates back to the year 793 and celebrated its 1,200th anniversary in 1993. The time pyramid was conceived to mark this 1,200-year period.&lt;ref name="Conception" /&gt;

== Concept ==
[[File:Zeitpyramide.svg|thumb|300px|[[Trimetric projection]] of the design of the ''Time Pyramid (Zeitpyramide)'' in [[Wemding]], Germany.]]

The pyramid, when completed in the year 3183, is scheduled to consist of 120 stone or concrete blocks, each measuring {{convert|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|1.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. Adjacent blocks are separated by gaps of half a block or {{convert|0.6|m|ft|abbr=on}}. One block is scheduled to be placed every ten years, taking 1,190 years (see [[Fencepost error]]) in total.

The base layer, measuring {{convert|13.8|by|13.8|m|ft|abbr=on}}, will consist of 64 blocks arranged in 8 rows and 8 columns. The second layer will consist of 36 blocks, in a 6 by 6 format. The third layer will consist of 16 blocks arranged in 4 by 4. The final, fourth layer, will consist of 4 blocks, arranged in 2 by 2. A model of the final artwork is exhibited at Wemding, at the ''Haus des Gastes''.&lt;ref name="Conception" /&gt;

The pyramid, as far as it exists today, is on a concrete pad on a rounded hilltop, the ''Robertshöhe'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/Home/Lokales/Donauwoerth/Lokalnachrichten/Artikel,-Ein-Wolf-an-der-Wiege-und-ein-Gebaeude-mit-1200-Jahren-Bauzeit-_arid,2235402_regid,5_puid,2_pageid,4496.html Ein Wolf an der Wiege und ein Gebäude mit 1200 Jahren Bauzeit] {{de icon}} ''[[Augsburger Allgemeine]]'', published: 4 September 2010, accessed: 14 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; on the northern edge of Wemding. The first block was placed in October 1993.&lt;ref name="Conception" /&gt; The {{convert|6.5|tonne|ton|adj=on}} third and most recent block was placed at 16:14 on 29 June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/donauwoerth/Denkmal-oder-Utopie-id25859776.html Denkmal oder Utopie? Der dritte Dekadenstein auf der Wemdinger Robertshöhe ist gesetzt], Helmut Bissinger&lt;/ref&gt;

The project's finance was mostly achieved through donations by local companies, which, for example, supplied the materials for the concrete slab for free. Additionally, the material of the blocks used is not fixed and may be altered in future generations depending on availability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeitpyramide.de/ Zeitpyramide] {{de icon}} Official ''Zeitpyramide'' website, accessed: 14 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The project is administrated by a foundation based in Wemding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeitpyramide.de/ Stiftung Wemdinger Zeitpyramide] {{de icon}} Official ''Zeitpyramide'' website, accessed: 14 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Timing ==
The significance of the number 12, 1,200 years and 120 stones is coincidental, with a construction date beginning in 1993 being the most practical. The reason for this is that the closest similar combinations before and after were or would have been possible only in 1633 (7 by 7, 840 years, 84 blocks) and 2443 (9 by 9, 1,650 years, 165 blocks).&lt;ref name="Conception" /&gt;

== Artist ==
The project is the brainchild of the artist Manfred Laber. The project began in June 1993. The idea of the concept is to give people a sense of what the span of 1,200 years really means.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeitpyramide.de/ Spatenstich für Projekt des Künstlers Manfred Laber] {{de icon}} Official ''Zeitpyramide'' website, accessed: 14 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Manfred Laber was born in Wemding in 1932 and studied painting at the ''Hochschule für Bildende Künste'' in [[Berlin]] in the 1950s. He has other artwork on permanent display on the Isla San Antonio, and in [[Alcanar]], [[Spain]], and [[Mormoiron]], [[France]]. Alcanar is also his part-time place of residence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeitpyramide.de/ Biographie Manfred Laber] {{de icon}} Official ''Zeitpyramide'' website, accessed: 14 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Vue de toits (Effet de neige)''''' (English title: ''View of rooftops (Effect of snow)'') is an [[oil painting]] by French [[impressionism|impressionist]] [[Gustave Caillebotte]] executed in the winter of 1878 and 1879.&lt;ref name=Varnedoe&gt;{{cite book|title=Gustave Caillebotte|last=Varnedoe|first=Kirk|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2000|isbn=9780300082791|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[canvas]] measures {{convert|81|x|65|cm|in}}. It was originally gifted by Caillebotte's brother in 1894 to the [[Musée du Luxembourg]],&lt;ref name="MO2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/index-of-works/notice.html?no_cache=1&amp;nnumid=108 | title=Notice of the work | publisher=musee-orsay.fr|year=2011 | accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; then transferred to the [[Musée du Louvre]] in 1929. In 1947, it was moved to the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]], which held many impressionist works in France after World War II. In 1986, it was transferred again to the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in [[Paris]], where it is currently displayed.&lt;ref name="MO2"/&gt; The painting is one of the few Caillebotte works that have remained in public view since the artist's death in 1894.&lt;ref name="MO"/&gt;

Caillebotte created many paintings showing urban Paris from unexpected perspectives, such as a streetscape seen from indoors in ''[[Young Man at His Window|Jeune homme à la fenêtre]]'' (1875), or the exaggerated perspective of ''[[Paris Street; Rainy Day|Rue de Paris, temps de pluie]]'' (1877). ''Vue de toits'' depicts snow-covered rooftops in [[Montmartre]], Paris from a high vantage point, possibly a balcony. Here Caillebotte employs a largely monochromatic palette of grays, adding additional color to highlight building features.&lt;ref name=MO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/search/commentaire/commentaire_id/vue-de-toits-effet-de-neige-21051.html|accessdate=29 June 2012|title=Gustave Caillebotte: Rooftops in the Snow (snow effect)|publisher=musee-orsay.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective was not at all common in French paintings, and in fact Caillebotte may have been inspired by the photographic works of [[Hippolyte Bayard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Gustave Caillebotte, Urban Impressionist | publisher=Art Institute of Chicago | author=[[Distel, Anne]] | year=1995 | page=153 | isbn=0789200414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was first shown at the fourth Impressionist Exhibition held in Paris in 1879, one of 25 works Caillebotte brought to the show. At the time, it did not garner much interest from the crowds, who preferred his portraits and nautical images. However, this image, and one other showing views of rooftops at that show, are now considered important works.&lt;ref name="MO"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2599">Founded in 1965, the '''Western Literature Association''' (WLA) is a non-profit, scholarly association that promotes the study of the diverse [[literature]] and cultures of the [[North American West]], past and present. Since its founding, the WLA has served to publish scholarship and promote work in the field; it has gathered together scholars, artists, environmentalists, and community leaders who value the West’s literary and cultural contributions to American and world cultures; it has recognized those who have made a major contribution to western literature and western studies; and it has fostered student learning and career advancement in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About WLA|url=http://www.westernlit.org/about/| publisher=Western Literature Association|accessdate=January 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Association for the Study of Literature and Environment]] (ASLE) was founded in 1992 at a special session of the Western Literature Association conference in Reno, Nevada, for the purpose of "sharing of facts, ideas, and texts concerning the study of literature and the environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=22PbbREoiY4C&amp;pg=PA241&amp;lpg=PA241#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Theory into Practice: An Introduction to Literary Criticism | publisher=Cengage Learning | author=Dobie, Ann B. | year=2011 | pages=241 | isbn=0-49590-233-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asle.org/discover-asle/vision-history/|title=Vision &amp; History|work=ASLE Home Page|accessdate=January 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asle.org/wp-content/uploads/ASLE_Policies_Bylaws2016.pdf|title=ASLE Bylaws|work=ASLE Home Page |date=April 2016|accessdate=January 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association publishes '''''Western American Literature: A Journal of Literary, Cultural, and Place Studies''''' (since 1965) in partnership with the [[University of Nebraska Press]]. It considers itself "the leading peer-reviewed journal in the literary and cultural study of the North American West, defined broadly to include western Canada and northern Mexico".&lt;ref name="About WAL"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westernlit.org/about-wal/ | title=About Western American Literature (WAL) | publisher=Western Literature Association | accessdate=January 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
