The Arrivas House is located at 46 St. George Street, [[St. Augustine, Florida]]. It was the first completed restoration project of the [[Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board]] (HSAPB), and was named after early owner Don Raimundo de Arrivas. 

== History ==
It is believed that the first building on this property dates back as early as 1650-1680, and was built of ripio, a shell concrete mixture. The original structure was replaced around 1725 with a building made of [[coquina]].  Don Raimundo de Arrivas is listed as the owner of the property on a 1764 map, which was created as an inventory of buildings that the Spanish compiled for the British when Florida became a colony of Great Britain. 

During the [[History of Florida|British Period]], the property was placed in the charge of a British agent, [[Jesse Fish]]. The property later reverted to the Arrivas heirs when Florida was regained by Spain in [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|1783]]. A 1788 map shows that the building had evolved into a large L-shaped masonry house, very similar to the structure that stands today. From 1824 until 1960 ownership changed over 20 times, with several architectural changes made, including the addition of a second story and balconies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guide Book: Including Descriptions of the Buildings, Crafts, and a Brief History of the Restoration of the Nation's Oldest City|last=Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board|first=|publisher=Department of Cultural Affairs, Department of State, State of Florida|year=1971|isbn=|location=Tallahassee, Florida|pages=25-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Arnau, St. Augustine Collector of Customs and Superintendent of Lighthouses, was another notable resident of the Arrivas House. While St. Augustine was under [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] control, he oversaw the darkening of the St. Augustine Lighthouse and removed its lighting apparatus.  In November 1861, Arnau was elected mayor, a post he resigned when the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] took control of the town.  He was imprisoned until lighting mechanisms, which he had stored in his home, were returned to the Union Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vivaflorida.org/Explore/Historic-and-Archaeological-Sites/Arrivas-House|title=Arrivas House / Historic and Archaeological Sites / Explore / Home - Viva Florida|website=vivaflorida.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board purchased the Arrivas House in July 1960, and set out to restore the structure to its [[History of Florida|Second Spanish Period]] appearance. It was the first restoration project they undertook in preparation for St. Augustine’s 400th Anniversary celebration in 1965. Work began on the home in January 1961, and was formally dedicated on March 11, 1963. Then Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] visited St. Augustine to mark the occasion, and gave a speech to the city from the Arrivas House balcony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/USACH00499/00010|title=Importance Of Restoration Cited By Vice President In Speech Climaxing Dedication|website=ufdc.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arrivas House served as an interpreted historic site run by the Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board, where costumed docents demonstrated typical activities of Spanish colonial women. This included spinning, weaving, and candle making. The second story briefly served as administrative offices for the Preservation Board. 

The Arrivas House was documented as part of the [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] in 1960. Complete documentation is available on the [[Library of Congress]]'s online catalog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/hh/item/fl0198/|title=Don Raimundo Arrivas House, 44 South George Street, Saint Augustine, St. Johns County, FL|last=Survey|first=Historic American Buildings|website=www.loc.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Present Day ==
Today, the Arrivas House is a commercial retail space, owned by the State of Florida and managed by [[University of Florida Historic St. Augustine, Inc.|University of Florida Historic St. Augustine, Inc]]. It is operated by The Panama Hat Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mypanamahat.com/|title=The Panama Hat Company {{!}} St. Augustine, FL since 1985|website=www.mypanamahat.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Brotherhood of Ruralists''' is a British art group founded in 1975 in [[Wellow, Somerset|Wellow]], [[Somerset]], to paint nature. Their work is figurative with a strong adherence to 'traditional' skills. Painting in oil and watercolour predominate, with mixed media assemblage, printmaking, ink and pencil drawing also being common. It has been described as "a kind of late twentieth-century reinvention of [[William Morris]]'s arcadian craft guilds."&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Sillar, "Caro verbum factus est: British art in the 1960s", in Bart Moore-Gilbert, ''Cultural Revolution? The Challenge of the Arts in the 1960s'', Routledge, New York, 1992, p.261&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Wellow Station (converted) - geograph.org.uk - 644658.jpg|thumb|The converted [[Wellow (Somerset) railway station|Wellow railway station]] in 2007]]
The group was founded when [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] and his then wife [[Jann Haworth]] moved to Wellow, having obtained permission to convert the disused [[Wellow (Somerset) railway station|Wellow railway station]] into a house. Other founding members were [[David Inshaw]] and two other couples: [[Ann Arnold]] and [[Graham Arnold (artist)|Graham Arnold]], and [[Annie Ovenden]] and [[Graham Ovenden]].&lt;ref name = "chiv"/&gt; The name "Brotherhood of Ruralists" was suggested by author [[Laurie Lee]], a supporter of the group. Some members were never happy with "brotherhood", since it implied an all-male membership.&lt;ref name = "cut"&gt;Andreae, Christopher, "One in a Pack of Ruralist Loners as a Group, the Ruralists Commanded More Attention Than They Would Have Done Separately They Exhibited Extensively", The Christian Science Monitor, October 9, 1992. p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Peter Blake, it was formed, {{quote|in opposition to the scholarly nature of contemporary art which believed that paintings were only really valid if they addressed social questions. Our aims are the continuation of a certain kind of English painting. We admire [[Samuel Palmer]], [[Stanley Spencer]], [[Thomas Hardy]], [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]], [[cricket]], the English landscape and the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]].&lt;ref&gt;Rural life of pop art icon, ''Bristol Evening Post'', June 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}} The group define a "ruralist" as "someone who is from the city who moves to the country".&lt;ref name = "chiv"&gt;Ian Chilvers, ''A Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Art'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1999, p.97.&lt;/ref&gt; The Brotherhood came to wide public attention following a BBC TV documentary, ''Summer with the Brotherhood'', which was broadcast in 1977.&lt;ref name = "chiv"/&gt;

==Style==
Unlike the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, the group did not promote (nor adhere to) a manifesto. Each artist's own techniques and work remains diverse with a common evocation of a mystical response to the observance of nature and rural life. Some of their output is intensely personal and sometimes surrealist in arrangement. Nevertheless, they expressed a common dissatisfaction with [[Abstraction (art)|abstraction]] and radical [[avant-garde|avant-gardism]] in art. Ovenden expressed distaste for the abstract [[New York School (art)|New York School]], which he described as "at best decorative and at worst little different from ... neurotic daubings."&lt;ref name = "cut"/&gt;

In turn, supporters of avant-garde art condemned their work as sentimental and nostalgic.&lt;ref name = "cut"/&gt; Critic Tom Lubbock objected that "they didn't see that their imagination of mystical, deep, England had already been fully colonised by commercial imagery. Their pristine visions of an unfallen world came straight from a pretty advert for soap or air-freshener."&lt;ref&gt;Lubbock, Tom, "Escape Artists", The Independent, April 28, 2008, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later history==
The group's work was very widely disseminated when the [[Arden Shakespeare]] commissioned illustrations from its members depicting characters from Shakespeare, to be used on the cover of the Arden editions of each of Shakespeare's plays.&lt;ref name = "cut"/&gt;

After six years the group lost some of its members. By 1984 David Inshaw, Jann Haworth and Peter Blake had left. The remaining four members continued the group, sometimes joined by Blake. They maintain an exhibitions programme both in the [[West country]] and London, and are members of the [[Arts Club]]. They were guest artists at the [[Stuckists]] ''Real Turner Prize Show'' 2000.

Recent exhibitions have included work by both present and past members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9164">'''Chinese folklore''' encompasses the folklore of [[China]], and includes songs, poetry, dances, puppetry, and tales. It often tells stories of [[human nature]], historical or legendary events, love, and the supernatural, or stories explaining natural phenomena and distinctive landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;Giskin, Howard.  ''Chinese Folktales.''  (NTC Publishing Group, Chicago, 1997).  {{ISBN|0-8442-5927-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Chinese mythology]] it forms an important element in [[Chinese popular religion]].

==Folktales==

The main influences on Chinese folk tales have been [[Taoism]], [[Confucianism]] and [[Buddhism]]. Some folktales may have arrived from Germany; others have no known western counterparts, but are widespread throughout East Asia.&lt;ref name="Folktales of China"&gt;Eberhard, Wolfram, ''Folktales of China.''(1965). University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1965. University of Congress Catalog Card Number: 65-25440&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese folktales include a vast variety of forms such as myths, legends, fables, etc. A number of collections of such tales, such as [[Pu Songling]]'s ''[[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]'', now remain popular. 

Chinese folklore contains many symbolic folk meanings for the objects and animals within the folktales. One example of this is the symbolic meaning behind frogs and toads. In the "Chinese myth of the Moon Goddess, Chang E", frogs and toads are a symbol of wealth and prosperity as well as symbolize fertility, regeneration, yin, and immortality. Each Chinese folktale includes this kind of representation of various objects and animals and uses symbolic messages through its characters and usually strives to convey a message that instills the reader with some sort of virtuous insight. These messages are vital to Chinese culture and through these folktales, they will be passed down to future generations to also learn from.&lt;ref&gt;Shanshan, Y. (2016). Frogs and Toads in Chinese Myths, Legends, and Folklore. Chinese America: History &amp; Perspectives, 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of folklore on other media==

Chinese folklore has provided inspiration for Chinese writers and poets for centuries. Folk songs which were originally partnered with dance and other styles of performing arts, provided inspiration for courtly poetry. Classical fiction began in the [[Han Dynasty]] and was modeled after oral traditions, while [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] and [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] era dramatic plays were influenced by folk plays.&lt;ref name="Folktales of China" /&gt;

Chinese folklore has provided inspiration for visual imagery by Chinese weavers, painters and watercolorists, florists. One of the most striking examples is a silk funerary banner (circa 168 BC) that contains a number of stories from early China.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=cuddgTWyx50C&amp;dq=hare+and+toad+on+the+moon&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Chinese Myths, by Anne Birrell. University of Texas Press, Sep 15, 2000 - Literary Criticism - 80 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern iterations of traditional Chinese stories can be found internationally as well as in native Chinese literature.  [[Laurence Yep]]'s ''[[The Magic Paintbrush]]'', [[Maxine Hong Kingston]]'s ''[[The Woman Warrior]]'', and [[Walt Disney Pictures]]' ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' all borrow from Chinese folklore traditions.

==Study of Chinese folklore==
The ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'', the earliest known Chinese collection of poetry, contains 160 folk songs in addition to courtly songs and hymns. One tradition holds that [[Confucius]] himself collected these songs, while another says that an emperor compiled them as a means to gauge the mood of the people and the effectiveness of his rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mockingbird.creighton.edu/english/worldlit/wldocs/churchill/bksongs.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/19980115021723/http://mockingbird.creighton.edu/english/worldlit/wldocs/churchill/bksongs.htm |archivedate=1998-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that Confucius did encourage his followers to study the songs contained in the ''Classic of Poetry'', helping to secure the ''Classic of Poetry'''s place among the ''[[Five Classics]]''. After Confucian ideas became further entrenched in Chinese culture (after about 100 BCE), Confucius's endorsement led many scholars to study the lyrics of the ''Classic of Poetry'' and interpret them as political allegories and commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mockingbird.creighton.edu/english/worldlit/wldocs/churchill/bksongs.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/19980115021723/http://mockingbird.creighton.edu/english/worldlit/wldocs/churchill/bksongs.htm |archivedate=1998-01-15 |df= }} /&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the 1910s, Chinese folklore began to gain popularity as an area of study with the beginnings of the movement to formally adopt [[Vernacular Chinese]] as the language of education and literature. Because Vernacular Chinese was the dialect in which most folklore was created, this movement brought to scholars' attention the influences that Vernacular Chinese folklore had upon classical literature. [[Hu Shih]] of the [[Peking University]], who had published several articles in support of the adoption of Vernacular Chinese, concluded that when Chinese writers drew their inspiration from folk traditions such as traditional tales and songs, Chinese literature experienced a renaissance. When writers neglected these sources, they lost touch with the people of the nation. A new emphasis on the study of folklore, Hu concluded, could therefore usher in a new renaissance of Chinese literature.&lt;ref name="Folktales of China" /&gt;

The Folksong Studies Movement became a key contributor to establishing Chinese Folklore as a modern academic discipline. This movement was founded by students and professors at Peking University in 1918. They were successful in creating a field of study that focused on literature pertaining to Chinese folklore and attempted to bring to light the early traditions and culture of Chinese folklore in order to reestablish China's national spirit.&lt;ref&gt;AN, D., &amp; YANG, L. (2015). Chinese Folklore Since the Late 1970s. Asian Ethnology, 74(2), 273-290.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A rising sense of national identity was also partially responsible for spurring the new interest in traditional folklore.  The first issue of the ''Folk-Song Weekly'', a publication issued by the Folk-Song Research Society, stated that "Based on the folk songs, on the real feeling of the nation, a kind of new national poetry may be produced."&lt;ref name="Folktales of China" /&gt;

Some folklore enthusiasts also hoped to further social reforms by their work. To help improve the condition of the Chinese people, it was believed, it was necessary to understand their ideas, beliefs, and customs.&lt;ref name="Folktales of China" /&gt; After China emerged from the [[Maoism|Maoist]] period in the late 1970s, the state had an increasingly more accepting position toward academic research on China’s cultural traditions and folklore. Forbidden traditions and practices in early Chinese history were at this point in time becoming more relevant and accepted within the Chinese culture.&lt;ref&gt;AN, D., &amp; YANG, L. (2015). Chinese Folklore Since the Late 1970s. Asian Ethnology, 74(2), 273-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Communist and Communist thinkers were especially energetic in this belief. In the time leading up to the founding of the [[Communist Party of China]], many folk songs and stories were collected by Communist thinkers and scholars. Often, they were reinvented and reinterpreted to emphasize such themes as the virtue of the working commoner and the evil of aristocracy, while stories that expressed praise for the emperor were frequently left out of Communist collections. Some folk tales and folk plays that exist today may in fact have been deliberately written by Communist authors to emphasize particular social morals.&lt;ref name="Folktales of China" /&gt;

The '''coat of arms of Namibia''' is the official heraldic symbol of [[Namibia]].  Introduced at the time of independence in 1990, it superseded the earlier coat of arms used by the South African administration of the territory.

==History==
The Constituent Assembly which drew up the Namibian Constitution in 1989 appointed a National Symbols Sub-Committee to produce a flag and coat of arms for the country.  The committee enlisted the assistance of the South African [[Bureau of Heraldry]].  After approving the [[flag of Namibia|flag]], the committee decided to use the same design as the coat of arms, with the addition of an [[African fish eagle]] (''Haliaeetus vocifer'') for a crest, and two gemsbok (''[[Oryx]]'') as supporters.&lt;ref name=nns&gt;Merrington, A.J. (1990).  'New National Symbols for the Republic of Namibia' in ''Arma'' Vol 32/1990 – II.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Welwitschia mirabilis'' on the compartment was taken over from the former arms of South-West Africa (see below).

==Blazon==
The arms are blazoned as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Shield: Tierced per bend sinister Azure, and Vert, a bend sinister Gules fimbriated Argent and in dexter chief a Sun with twelve straight rays Or charged with an annulet Azure (the design of the [[Flag of Namibia]]).
* Crest: Upon a traditional head-ring Vert charged with six lozenges conjoined Or, a fish eagle rising wings elevated and displayed proper.
* Supporters: Two oryx proper.
* Compartment: A Namib sand dune with a [[Welwitschia|''Welwitschia mirabilis'']] on the foreground.
* Motto: Unity Liberty Justice.&lt;ref name=nns/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=National Coat of Arms of the Republic of Namibia Act, 1990 |number=1 |language=English |date=28 March 1990 |article= |url=http://www.parliament.gov.na/acts_documents/155_act_1_of_1990.pdf |accessdate=27 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030061903/http://www.parliament.gov.na/acts_documents/155_act_1_of_1990.pdf |archivedate=30 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earlier coats of arms ==

===Proposed arms 1914===
[[File:Proposed Coat of Arms Southwest Africa 1914.png|1914 proposed coat of arms of [[German South-West Africa]]|thumb|left|120px]]
In 1914, the German Empire government decided to assign [[Coats of arms of German colonies|coats of arms to German colonies]], including South-West Africa.  Arms were designed, but [[World War I]] broke out before the project was finalised, and the arms were never taken into use. The arms proposed for [[German South-West Africa]] depicted an [[Afrikaner cattle|Afrikaner bull]]'s head, a diamond, and the German imperial eagle.&lt;ref name=lv&gt;Pama, C. (1965). ''Lions and Virgins''&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, [[neo-colonialism]], the proposed arms made a short public appearance, in a slight modified form on [[postcard]]s issued by the German Colonial Soldiers' League (German ''[[:de:Deutscher Kolonialkrieger-Bund|Deutscher Kolonialkrieger-Bund]]'') as well as decoration on calendars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/deutsche-kolonialgeschichte-a-948151.html The Emperor's new coat of arms] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116231811/http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/deutsche-kolonialgeschichte-a-948151.html |date=16 November 2016 }} (Spiegel Online, 26 February 2009, in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arms 1963–80===
In 1958, the [[South-West Africa]]n administration decided that the territory should have an official coat of arms.  After obtaining South African government approval, the administration engaged Dr [[Coenraad Beyers]] to design the arms.  They were finalised in 1961, taken into use in 1963, and registered at the [[Bureau of Heraldry]] in 1964.

The arms were discontinued when South-West Africa was reconstituted into a three-tier system of government in 1980.  The Administration for Whites (1980–89) took over the arms in 1981.&lt;ref name=an&gt;Brownell, F.G. (1990).  'The Evolution of the Coats of Arms and Flags of SWA and Namibia' in ''Archives News'' (August 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

The official blazon of the arms is :
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Per chevron ployé Argent and Gules, dexter a karakul ram's face caboshed Sable and sinister the head and neck of an Afrikander bull proper, in base two miner's hammers in saltire Or and there-under three triangular diamonds Argent 2 and 1; on a chief Gules a pale Argent charged with an eagle Sable langued and membered Gules, dexter a representation of Fort Namutoni and sinister a Portuguese padrao both Argent.
* Crest : A gemsbok statant gardant proper.
* Supporters: Dexter a springbok and sinister a kudu, both proper, resting on a desert-like  knoll,  with a growing [[Welwitschia|''Welwitschia mirabilis'']] in the foreground proper.
* Motto : Viribus unitis.&lt;ref name=boh&gt;[http://www.national.archsrch.gov.za Bureau of Heraldry]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Alexidze''' ({{lang-ka|დავით ალექსიძე}}) is a Georgian artist. His art can most precisely be described as mystic realism. His works are introduced in many catalogues and preserved in various private collections. He is the Dean of the Faculty of Visual arts of [[Tbilisi State Academy of Arts]].

[[File:David Alexidze. Nude.jpg|thumb|300px|David Alexidze. Nude.120x90,oil on canvas.1995]]

== Education ==

Georgian art went through the complicated process of changes in 1990s, preceded by the decade which had formed and evolved new trends. The end of the Soviet era ( [[Revolutions of 1989]] ) had severe impact on the country itself, followed by collapse of the fundamentals, the [[Georgian Civil War]], notion of the upcoming disasters, hopelessness - nothing horizontal or vertical and as a result - amorphous visual expression in the Georgian cultural narrative ( [[Culture of Georgia (country)]] ). This was when artist David Alexidze first shared his art works with the public. It did not take him much effort to get established within the then active Georgian artistic society, where he found his place right after graduation from [[Tbilisi State Academy of Arts]], [[Nikoloz (Koka) Ignatov]] ’s Workshop, 1988-1991. He was a prodigy in arts, having created in his early years a sophisticated artistic system through active philosophical and critical thinking.

== Artwork ==

In general four trends can be identified in Davit Alexidze’s art: graphical works on black background, [[figurative painting]]s on black background (times on textured surface) of elongated vertical or horizontal picture planes, yellow series and black-and-white [[abstract art]]s. Alexidze’s art is being created in late 20th and early 21st century. It is a collection of real senses, which regardless the richness of colors, is quite dark, although the audience does not get lost in this gloom; and this is a kind of a game or an idea on gaming, which is bright new to [[Georgian art]].

'''Dorothy Berry''' (born 1942) is an Australian artist working in the genres of [[Outsider art]], and ''Art Brut'', based in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dorothy BERRY|url=http://cs.nga.gov.au/Detail.cfm?IRN=123466|publisher=National Gallery of Art, Canberra|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is known primarily for her densely composed depictions of animals and birdlife, executed in pastel. Berry resides in the Melbourne suburb of [[Kingsbury, Victoria|Kingsbury]] and has worked from her [[Northcote, Victoria|Northcote]]-based studio at Arts Project Australia since 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arts Project Australia at 2014 Melbourne Art Fair|url=http://www.gandelphilanthropy.org.au/2014/08/arts-project-australia-2014-melbourne-art-fair/|publisher=Handel Philanthropy|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berry's work has been represented in four solo exhibitions, and has exhibited widely, both nationally and internationally in group shows, including ‘My Puppet, My Secret Self’, at the Substation, Newport; ‘Inside Out/Outside In’, Access Gallery, National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne; and ‘Turning the Page’, Gallery 101, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Her work is held in the collections of the [[National Gallery of Australia]] and MADMusée, [[Liege|Liège]], Belgium, and the Centre for Australian Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daye|first1=Cheryl|title=Dorothy Berry: Birds on a wire|date=2009|publisher=Northcode, VIC Arts Project Australia|isbn=9780958665957|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/28896803?selectedversion=NBD44671049|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Berry, Dorothy (AUS)|url=http://www.madmusee.be/fr/collection-2&amp;artistes_11.html#B|website=MADMusée - Le MADmusée abrite un patrimoine unique en son genre : une collection internationale, actuellement riche de quelque 2300 pièces, toutes réalisées par des artistes déficients mentaux travaillant, pour la majorité d’entre eux, dans un contexte d’atelier.|publisher=MADMusée|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BERRY, Dorothy 1942|url=http://artsearch.nga.gov.au/SEARCH.cfm|website=Search the Collection - acquisitions|publisher=National Gallery of Australia|accessdate=19 January 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112053749/http://artsearch.nga.gov.au/Search.cfm|archivedate=12 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Berry is primarily a self-taught artist who attributes her artistic talents to her mother. Since 1985 she has maintained studio at Arts Project Australia (APA), an organization devoted to supporting and promoting artists living with an intellectual disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dorothy Berry|url=https://www.artsproject.org.au/artist/dorothy-berry/|website=Arts Project Australia|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The APA dos not provide training but rather, provides access to fine art materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supported Studio Network|url=http://aarts.net.au/supportedstudios/studios/arts-project-australia/|website=arts.net/au|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although her work has thematically changed very little over the course of her career she substituted pastel for paint as the preferred medium for her work during the early years of her studio residency at APA.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Another APA artist, Maxine Ryder, proposed a collaborative project with Berry resulting in the exhibition ''Cut It Out'' (referring to the collaborative wood cut-outs) in the 1995 show.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bridie|first=Sandra|year=2009|title=Interview with Maxine Ryder regarding the curation of retrospective exhibition for Dorothy Berry|url=|journal=Berry: Bird on a Wire: exhibition catalogue|volume=|pages=|via=Arts Project Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berry's first solo exhibition followed shortly thereafter, in 1996. During the late 1980s and early 1990s she attended weekly life-drawing classes at the School of Art at Phillip Institute of Technology (now [[RMIT University]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Collections==
Berry's work is included in three museum collections. Berry has been identified as one of Australia’s key artists within the [[Outsider art|Outsider Art]] genre, as can be evidenced by her inclusion in major Outsider Art exhibitions and fairs. Her work has been acquired for major collections at the [[National Gallery of Australia]] (Accession number: NGA 2002.431.466) and MADMusée, [[Liege|Liège]], Belgium. Two of her lithographs, are held in the collection of the Centre for Australian Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=not titled (figure stars and bird)|url=http://www.printsandprintmaking.gov.au/works/7721/|website=Australian Prints and Printmaking|publisher=Centre for Australian Art|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=not titled (abstract shapes)|url=http://www.printsandprintmaking.gov.au/works/9632/|website=Australian Prints and Printmaking|publisher=Centre for Australian Art|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career, themes and style ==
Berry’s work is described in the popular press as both “instinctive” and “spontaneous,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The Famous Artist|last=|first=|date=29 April 2009|work=The Age|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recurring themes in her work are animals, birds and religion, for the course of her career.&amp;nbsp;Maxine Ryder, who collaborated with Berry in her early years and returned to Australia to curate a retrospective exhibition of her work twenty years later, remarks on the autobiographical nature of Berry’s work, noting that her bird imagery is most likely a form of self-portraiture and that the recurring themes of marriage and motherhood in her self-portraits are a response to her acquired disability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her best-known pastel works, which use a palette of heavily-saturated colours, feature strong line-work and a stylistic tendency to layer and rework imagery; so much so, that the artwork itself is often destroyed in the process of its making.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In recent years, Berry’s works have become less gestural and smaller in scale, most likely due to increasing limitations on her physical mobility. In addition to pastel, the artist also works in lithography, acrylic paint and ink whereby "Throughout this experimentation with this variety of mediums, she has remained thematically consistent throughout her years as an artist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Berry, Dorothy|url=http://www.printsandprintmaking.gov.au/artists/8660/works/|website=Australian Prints and Printmaking|publisher=Center for Australian Art|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://visual.artshub.com.au/news-article/reviews/visual-arts/samantha-wilson/dorothy-berry-%E2%80%93-bird-on-a-wire-arts-project-australia-178195|title=Bird On A Wire|last=Wilson|first=Samantha|date=1 June 2009|work=ArtsHub|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arts writer Samantha Wilson notes that Berry's work "goes from simple line drawings to crowded larger works always with a certain clarity about the images that she wants to depict, from the segmented women’s bodies in the autobiographical section, to the darker, more solid palettes of her depictions of religious figures and nuns."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Solo exhibitions ==
Berry has had four solo exhibitions: ''Dorothy Berry – Bird on a Wire'', Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2009; ''A Survey 1987-2002'', Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2002; ''Recent works'', Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 1998; ''Penguins, Ducks, Owls &amp; Angels'', Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 1996

== Selected group exhibitions ==
Berry has exhibited in over 30 group exhibitions including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Samantha|title=Dorothy Berry – Bird on a Wire: Arts Project Australia|url=http://visual.artshub.com.au/news-article/reviews/visual-arts/samantha-wilson/dorothy-berry-–-bird-on-a-wire-arts-project-australia-178195|website=Visual Arts Hub|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dutch Design Awards''' (DDA) are a series of awards to honor [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[designer]]s. The awards are handed out during the annual [[Dutch Design Week]] in the Dutch city of [[Eindhoven]]. A year book and exhibition of the nominated designs are also presented as part of the event. The Dutch Design Awards are organised by the Dutch Design Award Foundation and the city of Eindhoven.

De Dutch Design Awards have been handed out since 2003. In 2008, the name was changed from the [[Dutch language|Dutch-language]] ''Nederlandse Design Prijzen'' to the current name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nederlandsedesignprijzen.nl/downloads/Press_release_new_name.pdf Dutch Design Awards: the new name of the Nederlandse Design Prijzen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724162021/http://www.nederlandsedesignprijzen.nl/downloads/Press_release_new_name.pdf |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty prizes are handed out during an annual awards show. In addition to the main prize, the Golden Eye, which honours the most successful Dutch designer or design studio, awards are handed out in a number of categories. Each category has its own selection committee, and the winners are selected by an international jury. One exception is the public award, the Audi Design Award; the winner of this prize is chosen from a shortlist by means of a public election held on the Web site of the Dutch Design Awards and in the [[De Bijenkorf|Bijenkorf]] department store in Eindhoven.

In 2009, the awards were presented on October 17 at [[Muziekcentrum Frits Philips]] in Eindhoven. The main prize, the Golden Eye, went to Studio Wieki Somers ([[Wieki Somers]] and [[Dylan van den Berg]]) for their ''Merry-go-round Coat Rack'', a [[carousel]]-like construction to hang coats, designed for the [[cloakroom]] of  [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]]. During the awards ceremony, the first edition of the Dutch Design Jaarboek was presented to Eindhoven mayor [[Rob van Gijzel]]. The nominated designs were exhibited from October 17 to 25 at the Brainport Greenhouse, a large glass greenhouse on [[Stadhuisplein]] square in Eindhoven.

A '''footstone''' is a marker at the foot of a grave.  The footstone lies opposite the [[headstone]], which is usually the primary grave marker.  As indicated, these markers are usually stone, though modern footstones are often made of concrete, or some metal (usually bronze) in the form of a cast plate, which may or may not be set in concrete.  The footstone may simply mark the foot of a grave, serving as a boundary marker for the grave plot, but more often provide additional information about the interred decedent. A footstone usually contains the initials of the person whose grave it marks.

==United States==
In the [[United States]], when a member or veteran of the [[U.S. Armed Forces]] dies, the federal government will provide and install a headstone inscribed with the veteran's name and relevant military information, at no cost to the family.  In many cases, the veteran and/or the veteran's family decide to purchase a larger and more personalized gravestone at their own expense.  The family then has the option of requesting a flat marker, which can be used as a footstone, from the federal government for the grave of the veteran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author= United States Department of Veterans Affairs |title= Types of Headstones and Markers Available: Flat Types  |date= 31 August 2010 |accessdate= 20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The preferred marker in these cases is a bronze plaque with the veteran's name and military information, and is often bolted to a granite base and set at the foot of a grave.  This optional footstone is preferred by families who want a personal headstone over the grave, but still want the grave marked with official recognition of the veteran's service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1= Ferguson |first1= Nancy |author2=Patrick Joyce |author3= Kevin O’Reilly |title= Parkman Township Overlook Cemetery Rules and Regulations |url= http://parkmanohio.com/ParkmanOverlookCemetary.htm |date= 21 September 2010 |accessdate =20 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ganjapa''' ({{lang-or|ଗଞ୍ଜପା}}) are the traditional [[playing card]]s from the [[India]]n state [[Odisha]].&lt;ref name=toi&gt;{{cite news|last1=Singha|first1=Minati|title=Ganjapa lost in the mists of time|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/Ganjapa-lost-in-the-mists-of-time/articleshow/35465926.cms|accessdate=8 November 2014|publisher=Times of India|date=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also refer to the [[trick-taking game|trick-taking]] [[card game]] that they are used for.
It is played with circular shaped [[Pattachitra]] painted cards. Originated in the 16th century, Ganjapa is a recreational game for male members of the [[Odia people|Odia]] society, primarily villagers, kings and their [[court]]men. Ganjapa is played as "''Charirangi''" (cards of 4 colors), "''Atharangi''" (cards of 8 colors), "''Dasarangi''" (cards of 10 colors), "''Bararangi''" (cards of 12 colors), "''Chaudarangi''" (cards of 14 colors) and "''Sohalarangi''" (cards of 16 colors). The variation of this game influenced by [[Persia]]n card game [[Ganjifa|Ganjifeh]] is known as "Mughal Ganjifa". The game is popular in [[Puri district|Puri]] and [[Ganjam district]] of Odisha.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|last1=Panda|first1=Namita|title=Days numbered for Ganjapa cards|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1140205/jsp/odisha/story_17690733.jsp#.VF2aqfmUfHU|accessdate=8 November 2014|publisher=Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hindu1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Das|first1=Sib Kumar|title=A unique pack of cards|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/a-unique-pack-of-cards/article3834260.ece|accessdate=8 November 2014|publisher=Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the relative isolation of Odisha in the past, Ganjapa developed very differently from the Ganjifa found in the rest of India.&lt;ref name="Mann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mann|first1=Sylvia|title=All Cards on the Table|date=1990|publisher=Deutsches Spielkarten-Museum|location=Leinfelden|pages=184-192|ref=Mann}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odisha has by far the largest community of Ganjifa players and manufacturers.

== Etymology ==
The [[Odia language|Odia]] word Ganjapa is believed to be related to "[[Ganjifa]]" (originated from [[Persian language|Persian]] word Ganjifeh)&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jena|first1=Monalisa|title=Playing cards of yore|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2001/07/01/stories/1301046e.htm|accessdate=8 November 2014|publisher=Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was popular by the [[Mughal emperors]].&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

== History ==
The first written document regarding the play dates back to [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] times 1399 – 1412, mentioning about the winning of a ransom by Mamluk’s army officer by playing Kanjafa. The [[Topkapı Palace]] in Istanbul has a collection of a set of Mamluk cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nandagopal|first1=Dr.Choodamani|title=Ganjifa – The Indian Playing Cards|url=http://www.aventure.ac.in/ganjifa-the-indian-playing-cards/|publisher=Aventure|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artworks used on Ganjapa cards are Pattachitra painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Samantaray |first1=Prafulla Kumar |title=Patta Chitra - It's Past and Present |issue=December 2005 |page=50 |url=http://odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/dec2005/engpdf/patta_chitra_its_past_and_present.pdf |accessdate=9 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109064833/http://odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/dec2005/engpdf/patta_chitra_its_past_and_present.pdf |archivedate=9 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pattachitra motifs and patterns with figurative representations of dancers and other people, and of the [[Ramayana]], [[Dasavatar]]a of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Vishnu]], and other deities of Hindu mythology are painted on the round cards.

Ganjapa appears very differently from Ganjifa found in other parts of India as well.&lt;ref name="Hopewell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hopewell|first1=Jeff|editor1-last=MacKenzie|editor1-first=Colin|editor2-last=Finkel|editor2-first=Irving|title=Asian Games: The Art of Contest|date=2004|publisher=[[Asia Society]]|location=New York|page=248|ref=Hopewell|chapter=Ganjifa: The Traditional Cards of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Moghul Ganjapa, the suit-symbols are now highly stylized and abstract. Dasavatara Ganjifa contains only 10 suits but its Ganjapa equivalent can contain 12, 16, 20, or 24 suits to make the game more challenging. The Ramayana type is presently unique to Odisha and perhaps the most popular in the present. Also produced are ones with birds as suit-symbols, a relatively modern invention marketed to tourists.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;

== Card making ==
[[File:Patta-painting of Ganjapa.webm|thumb|Girl painting Ganjapa cards at [[Raghurajpur]] craft's village. [[Puri district|Puri]]]]
The card making procedure resembles that of Pattachitra. Layers of glue made by grinding tamarind seeds are pasted on cloth are applied and dried. Circular shaped cards then are carved using hollow iron cylinders. Two circular sheets are joined together to make a card. After drying natural dyes made of [[lac]], limestone (for white color), coal-carbon (for black) and [[tamarind]] (for yellow) are used to paint figures.&lt;ref name=hindu/&gt;

== Variations ==
[[File:Carirangi Ganjapa.jpg|thumb|Dasarangi Ganjapa cards]]
Ganjapa is played as "''Charirangi''" (cards of 4 colors or 4 suits in a pack of card), "''Atharangi''" (cards of 8 colors),&lt;ref name=toi/&gt; "''Dasarangi''" (cards of 10 colors), "''Bararangi''" (cards of 12 colors), "''Caudarangi''" (cards of 14 colors) and "''Sohalarangi''" (cards of 16 colors). Each color has 12 cards that makes the total number of cards an integer of number associated with the card's name, i.e. a "Charirangi Ganjapa" has 48 cards similar to [[playing cards]], "Atharangi Ganjapa has 96 cards and so on.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref name=hindu/&gt; Each color is recognizable by a unique background color. Each suit contains 10 numbered cards (1-10), a king and [[vizier]]. The king possesses the highest value followed by the vizier and then the numerical series in descending order. The king's card has a painting of him in sitting posture with legs folded at the knees (known as "chauka madi basa"), with the vizier's card with him standing. The king is also seen riding a chariot with the minister mounted on a horse. Some of the cards have the king with two heads and the minister with one head. Signature figures from Pattachitra like imaginary figure with human head and four legs of four different animals are also seen in cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GANJAPA playing cards|url=http://www.riace.in/workshop/ganjapa.html|website=RIA/CE|publisher=Raghurajpur International Art/Culture Exchange|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gare Montparnasse (The Melancholy of Departure)''''' (Italian: ''La stazione di Montparnasse)'' (1914) is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Metaphysical art|metaphysical painter]] [[Giorgio de Chirico]]. Many of de Chirico’s works were inspired by the introspective feelings evoked by travel. He was born in Greece to Italian parents. This work was painted during a period when he lived in [[Paris]].

The painting depicts the [[Gare Montparnasse]] railway station in [[Paris]], [[France]]. It is a classic example of de Chirico’s style, depicting an angular perspective on an outdoor architectural setting in the long shadows and deep colours of early evening. On the horizon is a steam train with a plume of white smoke billowing away from it. The train image appears several times in de Chirico's work. In the foreground is a bunch of bananas, another recurring image in de Chirico's work (cf. ''[[Le Rêve Transformé]]'').

In 1916, de Chirico painted another work simply titled ''[[The Melancholy of Departure]]''.

The '''Hezilo chandelier''' ({{lang-de|Heziloleuchter}}) is an 11th-century [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[wheel chandelier]]. It is part of the treasures of the [[Hildesheim Cathedral]] in [[Hildesheim]], Germany, which has been a UNESCO [[World Cultural Heritage]] site since 1985. The chandelier was most likely commissioned by Bishop [[Hezilo of Hildesheim]], who rebuilt the cathedral after a fire. He probably also influenced the program of imagery and inscriptions. It is the largest of four extant wheel chandeliers of the period; the others surviving examples are the [[Azelin chandelier]] (also in Hildesheim), the [[Barbarossa chandelier]] in the [[Aachen Cathedral]], and the Hartwig chandelier in the [[Comburg|Abbey of Comburg]].

During the restoration of the cathedral (from 2010 to 2014), the chandelier was installed in [[St. Godehard, Hildesheim|St. Godehard]], a [[Minor basilica|basilica]] since 1963 and the temporary bishop's seat. After the restoration of the cathedral, reopened on 15 August 2014, it was returned to its original location in the cathedral's nave.

== Description ==

[[File:Hildesheim Dom Radleuchter.jpg|thumb|The chandelier in the cathedral, {{circa|2003}}]]
The Hezilo chandelier is composed of a circular hoop which is {{convert|6|metres|ft}} in diameter. The hoop is made of gilt copper and bears [[Latin]] inscriptions on the upper and lower edges. Between the inscriptions are three horizontal bands, with the middle band bulging outwards, which are richly decorated with openwork foliage. There are square [[merlon]]s on top of the hoop holding seventy-two candles.&lt;ref name="Crafts"&gt;Julia de Wolf Addison: [http://www.digilibraries.com/html_ebooks/102380/18212/www.digilibraries.com@18212@18212-h@18212-h-0.htm Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages] Medieval Histories&lt;/ref&gt;

Twelve towers and twelve gate-houses alternate along the outside of the hoop. The layout of the towers is a [[Greek cross]] with four apses (alternately rounded with domed roofs and square with pitched roofs) and a doorway. The upper parts of the towers have a narrower form, extending above the candles on the hoop and topped with large balls. Small statues or lamps probably originally stood inside these towers.

The gatehouses are flat, no higher than the hoop and are closed at the rear - where the ropes which hold up the chandelier are anchored. Each gate is flanked by two small but richly decorated round turrets and is crowned with battlements and the name of an [[apostle]]. It is likely that there were once images of these apostles in the doorways.

In the center, a large lamp is hung from a rope. The chandelier, also called a ''{{lang|la|corona}}'' (crown) or circular chandelier,&lt;ref name="Crafts" /&gt; hung in the nave until 1944, when it was removed to protect it from bombing. It hung above the altar in the crossing from the reopening of the cathedral in 1960 to 2010, when cathedral restoration work began.&lt;ref name="Gallistl, p. 43"&gt;Gallistl, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[Bernward of Hildesheim|Bernward]], [[List of bishops of Hildesheim#Bishops of Hildesheim till 1235|Bishop of Hildesheim]], gifted the first large wheel chandelier to the Hildesheim Cathedral built by Bishop [[Altfrid]], and later also gave one to the adjacent church of [[St. Michael's Church, Hildesheim|St. Michael]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Vita Bernwardi]] c.8&lt;/ref&gt; After Altfrid's cathedral burned down in 1046, Bishop Hezilo had it rebuilt with alterations, rejecting the plan of his predecessor [[Azelin]] to build a new cathedral, and in the nave he hung a "crown chandelier of shimmering gold", which is now known by his name as the ''Hezilo chandelier''.&lt;ref&gt;Gallistl, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear what influence the earlier chandelier of Bernward had on the design of this replacement.&lt;ref&gt;Martina Giese, ''Die Textfassungen der Lebensbeschreibung Bischof Bernwards von Hildesheim''. ([[Monumenta Germaniae Historica|MGH]] Studien und Texte 40), Hannover 2006, {{ISBN|3-7752-5700-4}}, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolism ==

The model for a chandelier as the symbol of the [[New Jerusalem]] was the great wheel chandelier in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] above [[Golgotha]]; the Azelin chandelier was designed to have the same symbolism.&lt;ref name="Niedersachsen"&gt;[http://www.welterbe-niedersachsen.de/content/der-thietmarleuchter-0 Der Thietmarleuchter] Weltkulturerbe in Niedersachsen. Retrieved 9 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of [[Islamic art]] in the ornamentation of the chandelier support the identification with Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Sabine Noack-Haley, "Islamische Elemente am Hezilo-Leuchter im Mariendom zu Hildesheim" in Martina Müller-Wiener, ''Al-Andalus und Europa''. Imhof, Petersberg 2004, {{ISBN|3-935590-77-6}}, pp. 197–204.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=The idea of the chandelier is the image of a floating city: according to the inscription, the [[New Jerusalem|Heavenly Jerusalem]] as target of the old and new covenants, fragrant with the scent of virtue, populated by the saints, lit by God himself, the source of all light.|sign=Bertram|source=p. 117}}

The Hezilo chandelier was at the liturgical center of the cathedral until the nineteenth century, with services held under its crown of light. Its location marked the beginning and end of the great processions of the cathedral chapter on Sundays and holidays. The chandelier served as a symbol of righteousness. Violations of the sovereignty of the diocese were solemnly resolved beneath it.&lt;ref&gt;Gallistl, pp.  49–53&lt;/ref&gt;

== Restoration ==

[[File:Hildesheim St. Godehard Heziloleuchter.JPG|thumb|In [[St. Godehard, Hildesheim|St. Godehard]], 2011]]
Restoration work was carried out in the 16th century and again at the beginning of the 19th and 20th centuries,  During the [[Second World War]], the Hezilo chandelier was dismantled and removed from the cathedral — which was virtually destroyed by Allied bombing in March 1945. After the cathedral was rebuilt during the 1950s, the 900-year-old chandelier was placed in the crossing. It underwent extensive conservation work from 2002 until 2007.&lt;ref name="Gallistl, p. 43"/&gt; In 2010, when restoration work on the cathedral began, it was moved to [[St. Godehard, Hildesheim|St. Godehard]], a Romanesque church in Hildesheim and the temporary seat of the bishop.
{{clear}}

== Inscription ==

Due to early modern restorations, the verse inscription has been significantly altered. The donor's name, "Hezilo" was written in a later script. The oldest version is in a manuscript from around 1500:
{{quote|text=
{{columns|width=auto

[[File:Indexed palette.png|frame|A 2-bit indexed color image. The color of each [[pixel]] is represented by a number; each number (the ''index'') corresponds to a color in the color table (the ''[[Palette (computing)|palette]]'').]]

In computing, '''indexed color''' is a technique to manage [[digital image]]s' colors in a limited fashion, in order to save computer [[computer data storage|memory]] and [[Hard disk drive|file storage]], while speeding up display refresh and file transfers. It is a form of [[Vector quantization#Use in data compression|vector quantization compression]].

When an image is [[encoding|encoded]] in this way, color information is not directly carried by the image [[pixel]] data, but is stored in a separate piece of data called a '''[[Palette (computing)|palette]]''': an array of color elements. Every element in the array represents a color, indexed by its position within the array. The individual entries are sometimes known as '''color registers'''. The image pixels do not contain the full specification of its color, but only its index in the ''palette''. This technique is sometimes referred as '''pseudocolor'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Digital Video and HDTV: Algorithms and Interfaces | author = Charles A. Poynton | publisher = Morgan Kaufmann | year = 2003 | isbn = 1-55860-792-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ra1lcAwgvq4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA38&amp;dq=pseudocolor&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=RrXER6SjLIecsgPI-NGwCA&amp;sig=IE3Yi_P2hkm5mz_kKA-VJ4tWIzw }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''indirect color''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~reckert/class5b_01.PDF Computer Graphics, Prof. R. Eckert, Lect. #5, February 2001, Binghamton U., N.Y.]&lt;/ref&gt; as colors are addressed indirectly.

Perhaps the first device that supported palette colors was a [[random access (computing)|random-access]] [[frame buffer]], described in 1975 by Kajiya, Sutherland and Cheadle.&lt;ref&gt;http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=281022&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author= James Kajiya |author2=Ivan Sutherland |author3=Edward Cheadle | title=A Random-Access Video Frame Buffer|journal=IEEE Conf on Computer Graphics, Pattern Recognition and Data Structures |year=1975 |pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This supported a palette of 256 36-bit RGB colors.

==Palette size==

{{main|Palette (computing)}}

The palette itself stores a limited number of distinct colors; 4, 16 or 
256 are the most common cases. These limits are often imposed by the 
target architecture's [[Video card|display adapter]] 
[[computer hardware|hardware]], so it is not a coincidence that those numbers are 
exact powers of two (the [[binary code]]): 
2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, 
2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;16 and 
2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;256. While 256 values can 
be fit into a single 8-[[bit]] [[byte]] (and then a single indexed color
pixel also occupies a single byte), pixel indices with 16 (4-bit, a 
[[nibble]]) or fewer colors can be packed together into a single byte 
(two nibbles per byte, if 16 colors are employed, or four 2-bit pixels 
per byte if using 4 colors). Sometimes, 1-bit (2-color) values can be 
used, and then up to eight pixels can be packed into a single byte; such
images are considered ''[[binary image]]s'' (sometimes referred as a 
''bitmap'' or ''bilevel image'') and not an indexed color image.

{{Color depth}}

If simple [[video overlay]] is intended through a 
''[[Palette (computing)#Transparent color in palettes|transparent color]]'', one 
palette entry is specifically reserved for this purpose, and it is 
discounted as an available color. Some machines, such as the [[MSX]] 
series, had the transparent color reserved by 
hardware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://emu-docs.org/VDP%20TMS9918/Datasheets/TMS9918.pdf Online datasheet for the Texas Instruments TMS9918 Video Chip used in  the MSX.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Indexed color images with palette sizes beyond 256 entries are rare. The
practical limit is around 12-bit per pixel, 4,096 different indices. To
use indexed 16 bpp or more does not provide the benefits of the indexed
color images' nature, due to the color palette size in bytes being 
greater than the raw image data itself. Also, useful direct RGB 
[[Highcolor]] modes can be used from 
[[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#15-bit RGB|15 bpp]] and up.

If an image has many subtle color shades, it is necessary to select a 
limited repertoire of colors to approximate the image using 
[[color quantization]]. Such a palette is frequently insufficient to represent 
the image accurately; difficult-to-reproduce features such as 
[[gradient]]s will appear blocky or as strips (''[[colour banding|color 
banding]]''). In those cases, it is usual to employ [[dither]]ing, which
mixes different-colored pixels in patterns, exploiting the tendency of 
human vision to blur nearby pixels together, giving a result visually 
closer to the original one.

Here is a typical indexed 256-color image and its own palette (shown as a
rectangle of swatches):

==Colors and palettes==
{{see also|List of palettes}}

How the colors are encoded within the color palette map of a given indexed color image depends on the target platform.

===Early color techniques===

Many early [[personal computer|personal]] and [[home computer]]s had very limited [[List of palettes#List of computer hardware palettes|hardware palettes]] that could produce a very small set of colors. In these cases, each pixel's value mapped directly onto one of these colors. Well-known examples include the [[List of 8-bit computer hardware palettes#Apple II series|Apple II]], [[List of 8-bit computer hardware palettes#C-64|Commodore 64]] and [[List of 8-bit computer hardware palettes#CGA|IBM PC CGA]], all of which included hardware that could produce a fixed set of 16 colors. In these cases, an image can encode each pixel with 4-bits, directly selecting the color to use. In most cases, however, the display hardware supports additional modes where only a subset of those colors can be used in a single image, a useful technique to save memory. For instance, the CGA's 320×200 resolution mode could show only four of the 16 colors at one time. As the palettes were entirely proprietary, an image generated on one platform cannot be directly viewed properly on another.

Other machines of this era had the ability to generate a larger set of colors, but generally only allowed a subset of those to be used in any one image. Examples include the 256-color palette on  [[List of 8-bit computer hardware palettes#Atari 400/800/XL/XE|Atari 8-bit machines]] or the 4,096 colors of the [[VT220|VT241]] terminal in [[ReGIS]] graphics mode. In these cases it was common for the image to only allow a small subset of the total number of colors to be displayed at one time, up to 16 at once on the Atari and VT241. Generally, these systems worked identically to their less-colorful brethren, but a key difference was that there were too many colors in the palette to directly encode in the pixel data given the limited amount of [[video memory]]. Instead, they used a [[colour look-up table]] (CLUT) where each pixel's data pointed to an entry in the CLUT, and the CLUT was set up under program control. This meant that the image CLUT data had to be stored along with the raw image data in order to be able to re-produce the image correctly.

===RGB===

Hardware palettes based on [[component video]] colors such as [[YPbPr]] or the like were generally replaced in the mid 1980s by the more flexible [[RGB color model]], in which a given color can be obtained by mixing different amounts of the three [[primary color]]s red, green, and blue. Although the total number of different colors depends on the number of levels per primary, and on a given hardware implementation (a [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#9-bit RGB|9-bit RGB]] provides 512 combinations, a [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#12-bit RGB|12-bit RGB]] provides 4,096, and so on), in this model [[Digital-to-Analog Converter]]s (DAC) can generate the colors — simplifying the hardware design — while the software can treat the number per levels used abstractly and manage the RGB colors in a device-independent fashion. With colors stored in RGB format within the palettes of indexed image files, any image can be displayed (through appropriate transformations) on any such system, regardless of the color depth used in the hardware implementation.

Today, display hardware and [[image file formats]] that deal with indexed color images almost exclusively manage colors in RGB format, the de facto standard encoding being the so-called [[True Color|truecolor]] or [[RGB color model#The 24-bit RGB representation|24-bit RGB]], with [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#24-bit RGB|16,777,216 different possible colors]]. However, indexed color images are not genuinely constrained to a 24-bit RGB color encoding; image palettes can hold any type of color encoding. For example, the [[PDF]] file format does support indexed color in other colorspaces, notably [[CMYK color model|CMYK]], and [[Adobe Distiller]] by default will convert images to indexed color whenever the total number of colors in an image is equal to or less than 256. When using RGB, the [[TIFF]] and [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] file formats can optionally store the RGB triplets with a precision of 16-bit (65,536 levels per component) yielding a total of 48 bits per pixel. A proposed extension to the TIFF Standard allows&lt;ref&gt;[http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/tiff/TIFFPM6.pdf The TIFF image file format specification]&lt;/ref&gt; non-RGB color palettes, but this was never implemented in software due to technical reasons. The color map table of the [[BMP file format]] indexed color mode stores its entries in BGR order rather than RGB, and has (in the current version) an additional unused byte for padding to conform to [[32-bit]] [[data structure alignment|word alignment]] during processing, but it is essentially still a 24-bit RGB color encoding.  (An earlier version of the BMP format used three bytes per 24-bit color map table entry, and many files in that format are still in circulation, so many modern programs that read BMP files support both variations.)

==Pixel bits arrangements==

Except for very low resolution graphic modes, early home and personal computers rarely implemented an "all-pixels-addressable" design - that is, the ability to change a single pixel to any of the available colors independently.  Their limitations came from employing separate ''color attribute'' or ''color RAM'' areas, leading to [[attribute clash]] effects.  Also, the pixel bits and/or the scan lines of the video memory were commonly arranged in odd ways convenient for the video generator hardware (thus saving hardware costs in a cost-competitive market), but sometimes creating difficulty for the people writing graphics programs. A pixel's bits in indexed-color, all-pixel-addressable images are not always contiguous in video memory or image files (i.e., [[packed pixel|chunky]] organization is not always used.)  Some video hardware, such as the 16-color graphic modes of the [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter]] (EGA) and [[Video Graphics Array]] (VGA) for [[IBM PC compatible]]s&lt;ref&gt;
Richard Wilton, Programmer's Guide to PC &amp; PS/2 VIDEO SYSTEMS, 1987, Microsoft Press. {{ISBN|1-55615-103-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
or the [[Amiga]] video buffer&lt;ref&gt;
Inc. Commodore-Amiga, Amiga Hardware Reference Manual, 1991, Addison-Wesley. {{ISBN|0-201-56776-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
are arranged as a series of [[bit plane]]s (in a configuration called [[planar (computer graphics)|planar]]), in which the related bits of a single pixel are split among several independent [[binary image|bitmap]]s.  Thus, the pixel bits are conceptually aligned along the 3D Z-axis.  (The "depth" concept here is not the same as that of pixel [[color depth|depth]].)

Early image file formats, such as [[PICtor PIC image format|PIC]], stored little more than a bare [[memory dump]] of the video buffer of a given machine.

Some indexed-color image file formats such as [[Graphics Interchange Format]] (GIF) allow the image's scan lines to be arranged in [[interleaving (bitmaps)|interleaved]] fashion (not linear order), which allows a low resolution version of the image to appear on screen while it is still downloading, so that the computer user can gain an idea of its contents during the seconds before the whole image arrives.  Here is an example of a typical vertically interleaved download in four steps:

[[File:IndexedColorSample InterleavedDownload (Caerulea3 crop).png|center]]

As seen here, the image has been divided into four groups of lines: group A contains every fourth line, group B contains lines immediately following ones in group A, group C likewise contains the lines immediately following those in group B, and group D contains the remaining lines, which are between group C lines (immediately above) and group A lines (immediately below).  These are stored into the file in the order A, C, B, D, so that when the file is transmitted the second received group (C) of lines lie centered between the lines of the first group, yielding the most spatially uniform and recognizable image possible, composed of only two of the groups of lines.  The same technique can be applied with more groups (e.g. eight), in which case at each step the next group to be sent contains lines lying at or near the centers of remaining bands that are not yet filled with image data.  This method, with four or eight groups of lines, was commonly used on the early World Wide Web during the second half of the 1990s.  Rather than leaving the background (black) showing as in the illustration above, the partial image was often presented on screen by duplicating each line to fill the space below it down to the next received image line.  The end result was a continuous image with decreased vertical resolution that would increase to full resolution over a few seconds as the later parts of the image data arrived.

==Advantages==

Indexed color saves a lot of memory, storage space, and transmission time: using [[True Color|truecolor]], each pixel needs 24 bits, or 3 bytes. A typical 640×480 [[Super VGA|VGA]] resolution truecolor uncompressed image needs 640×480×3&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;921,600 bytes (900 KiB). Limiting the image colors to 256, every pixel needs only 8 bits, or 1 byte each, so the example image now needs only 640×480×1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;307,200 bytes (300 KiB), plus 256×3&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;768 additional bytes to store the palette map in itself (assuming RGB), approximately one third of the original size. Smaller palettes (4-bit 16 colors, 2-bit 4 colors) can pack the pixels even more (to one sixth or one twelfth), obviously at cost of color accuracy.

Indexed color was widely used in early [[personal computer]]s and display adapters' hardware to reduce costs (mainly by requiring fewer of the then-expensive [[RAM]] [[Integrated circuit|chips]]) but also for convenient image management with limited-power [[CPU]]s (of the order of 4 to 8 [[MHz]]), file storage ([[magnetic tape data storage|cassette tape]]s and low density [[floppy disk]]s).  Notable computer graphics systems extensively (or even exclusively) using pseudocolor palettes in the 1980s include [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]], [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]], and VGA (for [[IBM PC compatible]]s), the [[Atari ST]], and [[Amiga]]'s [[Original Amiga chipset|OCS]] and [[Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]].

Image files exchanged over the [[Compuserve]] net in the early 1990s were encapsulated in the [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] format. Later, the [[HTML]] web pages used the GIF along with other indexed color-supporting file formats such as [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], to exchange limited-color images quickly and store them in limited storage space.

Most [[image file formats]] that support indexed color images also commonly support some [[Image compression|compression]] scheme, enhancing their ability to store the images in smaller files.

Interesting [[List of software palettes#Color gradient palettes|colorized and artistic]] effects can be easily achieved by altering the color palette of indexed color images, for example to produce colorized [[sepia tone]] images. Due to the separate nature of the associated palette element of the indexed color images, they are ideal to remap [[grayscale]] images into [[false color]] ones through the use of [[List of software palettes#False color palettes|false color palette]]s.

Simple [[video overlay]] can be achieved easily through the [[Palette (computing)#Transparent color in palettes|transparent color]] technique.

By manipulating the color hardware registers ([[Color look-up table]] or CLUT) of the display adapter in the indexed color graphic modes, full-screen color-animation effects can be achieved without redrawing the image - that is, at low CPU time cost; a single change of the register values affects the whole screen at once.  Color-map animation, also known as [[Color cycling]], is extensively used in the [[demoscene]]. The Microsoft Windows boot logo screen in Windows 95, 98, ME, and 2000 Professional (which uses VGA 320x200x256 color display mode because it is the greatest common denominator on all PCs) employs this technique for the scrolling gradient bar across the bottom of the screen; the picture is a static image with no pixels rewritten after it is initially displayed.  Custom boot screen images could tap the cycled colors to animate other parts of the images.

==Disadvantages==

The main disadvantage of using indexed color is the limited set of simultaneous colors per image. Small 4- or 16-color palettes are still acceptable for little images ([[icon (computing)|icons]]) or very simple graphics, but to reproduce real life images they become nearly useless. Some techniques, such as [[color quantization]], [[Spatial anti-aliasing|anti-aliasing]] and [[dithering]] combined together can create indexed 256-color images comparable to the original up to an acceptable level.

Indexed color images are heavily dependent on their own color palettes. Except for a few well known fixed-color palettes (such as that of the [[Color Graphics Adapter]]—CGA), raw image data and/or color map tables cannot be reliably exchanged between different image files without some kind of intermediate mapping. Also, if the original color palette for a given indexed image is lost, it can be nearly impossible to restore it. Here is an example of what happens when an indexed color image (the previous parrot) has been associated with an incorrect color palette:

:[[File:Incorrect 8bits palette sample image.png]]

Indexed color graphic modes for display adapters have the 16- or 256-color limit imposed by hardware. Indexed color images with rich but incompatible palettes can only be accurately displayed one at a time, as in a [[slideshow]]. When it is necessary to show multiple images together, as in a mosaic of [[thumbnail]]s, a common or ''[[Palette (computing)#Adaptive versus master palettes|master palette]]'' is often used, which encompasses as many different hues as possible into a single set, thereby limiting the overall accurate color availability.

The following image is a mosaic of four different indexed color images rendered with a single shared ''master palette'' of [[List of software palettes#6-8-5 levels RGB|6-8-5 levels RGB]] plus 16 additional grays. Note the limited range of colors used for every image, and how many palette entries are left unused.

:[[File:IndexedColorSample (Mosaic).png]]

Many indexed color display devices do not reach the 24-bit limit for the full RGB palette. The [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] for IBM PC compatibles, for example, only provides an [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#18-bit RGB|18-bit RGB]] palette with 262,144 different possible colors in both 16- and 256- indexed color graphic modes.

Some image editing software allows [[gamma correction]] to be applied to a palette for indexed color image files. In general, to apply a gamma correction directly to the color map is bad practice, due to the original RGB color values being lost. It is better to apply the gamma correction with the display hardware (most modern display adapters support this feature), or as an active intermediate step of the rendering software through [[color management]], which preserves the original color values. Only when the indexed color images are intended for systems that lack any kind of [[color calibration]], and they are not intended to be cross-platform, gamma correction may be applied to the color table itself.

==Image file formats supporting indexed color==

These are some of the most representative image file formats that support indexed color modes. Some of these support other modes (e.g. truecolor), but only the indexed color modes are listed here.

:''NOTE: most of the formats will also support a color table with fewer colors than the maximum that a given bit depth can offer.

The '''Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990''' (P.L. 101-644) is a  truth-in-advertising law which prohibits [[misrepresentation]] in marketing of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] or [[Alaskan Natives|Alaska Native]] arts and crafts products within the United States. It is illegal to offer or display for sale, or sell any art or craft product in a manner that falsely suggests it is Indian produced, an Indian product, or the product of a particular Indian or Indian Tribe or [[Native American art|Indian arts]] and crafts organization, resident within the United States. For a first time violation of the Act, an individual can face civil or criminal penalties up to a $250,000 fine or a five-year prison term, or both. If business violates the Act, it can face civil penalties or can be prosecuted and fined up to $1,000,000.

The law covers all Indian and Indian-style traditional and contemporary arts and crafts produced after 1935. The Act broadly applies to the marketing of arts and crafts by any person in the United States. Some traditional items frequently copied by non-Indians include Indian-style jewelry, pottery, baskets, [[Zuni fetish|carved stone fetishes]], woven rugs, [[kachina]] figures, and clothing.

The [[Indian Arts and Crafts Board]], an agency established in 1934, has responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the Act.

==Definitions==
The [[US Department of the Interior]] explicitly states on its informational website about the Act that, "Under the Act, an Indian is defined as a member of any federally or State recognized Indian Tribe, or an individual certified as an Indian artisan by an Indian Tribe."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doi.gov/iacb/act.html "The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925020543/http://www.doi.gov/iacb/act.html |date=2006-09-25 }} ''US Department of the Interior, Indian Arts and Crafts Board.'' Retrieved 24 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Section 309.2, the Act defines an "Indian tribe" as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;(1) Any Indian tribe, band, nation, Alaska Native village, or any organized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians; or (2) Any Indian group that has been formally recognized as an Indian tribe by a State legislature or by a State commission or similar organization legislatively vested with State tribal recognition authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2001/aprqtr/pdf/25cfr308.4.pdf p. 785 of the Act.] US Department of the Interior, Indian Arts and Crafts Board. Retrieved 23 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All products must be marketed truthfully regarding the Indian heritage and tribal affiliation of the producers, so as not to mislead the consumer. It is illegal to market an art or craft item using the name of a tribe if a member, or certified Indian artisan, of that tribe did not actually create the art or craft item.

Section 309.4 of the act also allows for individuals with tribal ancestry who are not eligible for enrollment to be designated as "an Indian artisan by a particular tribe". The certification must be documented in writing by the tribal government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnatam.com/law.html "Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 Public Law 101-644."] ''Native American Artists.'' 21 Oct 1996. Accessed 18 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act does not apply to [[Service (economics)|services]] as was revealed by the judgement in a case against [[James Arthur Ray]].

==Controversy==
Cultural anthropologist and attorney Gail Sheffield and others claim that this law has had "the unintended consequence of sanctioning discrimination against Native Americans whose tribal affiliation was not officially recognized."&lt;ref&gt;Gail Sheffield, ''The Arbitrary Indian: The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990''. University of Oklahoma Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who claim to be Native artists but are not enrolled in a tribe run the risk of fines or imprisonment if they continue to sell their art while claiming Native heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Perezo, "Indigenous Art." In ''A Companion to American Indian History'', ed. by Philip Deloria and Neal Salisbury (Blackwell, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James J. Kilpatrick, "[http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1992-12-13/news/9203060467_1_indian-tribe-indian-arts-indian-blood A Cozy Little Restraint Of Trade Rules Indian Arts And Crafts]".

[[File:John-Dauban-savoyard-march81.jpg|thumb|right|Contemporary press caricature of D'Auban]]
'''Frederick John D'Auban''' (1842 – 15 April 1922) was an English dancer, choreographer and actor of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era]]s.  Famous during his lifetime as the ballet-master at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], he is best remembered as the choreographer of many of the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas.

After performing as a child with his family, D'Auban continued a career as a comic dancer in [[music hall]] and [[pantomime]].  He also served as dance master for the [[Alhambra Theatre]], the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]], and, for decades, Drury Lane.  In 1868, he began a long association with [[W. S. Gilbert]], staging the dances for most of the original productions of the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas, including ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1878) and ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1885), as well as many other [[Savoy opera]]s.  Between the 1860s and 1909, D'Auban choreographed more than 150 productions, including pantomimes, [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]], [[Edwardian musical comedies|musical comedies]] and [[comic opera]]s.  He also taught dance to many who became famous performers.

==Biography==

===Early years===
As a child, D'Auban appeared with his sister, Marie, as Madame D'Auban's "celebrated infant dancers", from 1850 onwards,&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', 26 May 1850, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to appear as part of the D'Auban family song and dance act throughout his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'' ''passim'', for example, 23 January 1853; 14 September 1856; 14 March 1858; and 29 May 1859&lt;/ref&gt; As adults, he and his sister appeared together in a comic dance double act at the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Observer]]'', 27 December 1863, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; They appeared together in a [[Harlequinade]] at the opening of the [[Surrey Theatre]], as Harlequin and Columbine, which ran during the Christmas season that year.&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 24 December 1865, p. 3; and 25 February 1866, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; They repeated their Harlequinade with variations during the Christmas seasons of 1868,&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 27 December 1868, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; 1869&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 26 December 1869, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; and 1871.&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 24 December 1871, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burlesque, pantomime and other early work===

D'Auban quickly became popular as a [[grotesque dance]]r and "[[Star Trap#Theatre .28star trap.29|star-trap]]" performer in London [[music halls]] early in his career.  From 1865 to 1868, he danced in many of the [[Alhambra Theatre]] [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] and [[pantomime]]s under director [[John Hollingshead]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead, John.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=j2NuebFfsScC&amp;dq=%22john+hollingshead%22+my+lifetime ''My Lifetime''], 2 vols., Chapter XXIII, (1895) S. Low, Marston: London&lt;/ref&gt;  He made a sensation in Paris in 1866, introducing that city to the star-trap.  According to Hollingshead, D'Auban was the champion of star-trap jumpers, able to spring through the trap, from below the stage, high up in the air in sight of the audience.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps". ''The Times'', 17 April 1922, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

D'Auban began his forty-year association with [[W. S. Gilbert]] in 1868 by appearing in the bill at the opening of Hollingshead's [[Gaiety Theatre, London]], including as one of two mysterious fiddlers in Gilbert's burlesque ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]''.  The other was John Warde, elder brother of [[Willie Warde]].  D'Auban and John Warde were billed as the theatre's "principal grotesque dancers and pantomimists".&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 27 November 1859, p. 10; and 20 December 1868, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; D'Auban then acted as ballet-master at the Gaiety, choreographing its famous burlesques, until 1891.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; In 1870 and in 1875 at the Gaiety, D'Auban choreographed [[Charles Dibdin]]'s musical farce, ''The Waterman''.  From 1868 to 1909, D'Auban arranged the dances for more than 150 productions in the [[West End theatre|West End]], at 30 different theatres.&lt;ref name=tm&gt;Biographical file for John D'Auban, list of productions and theatres, [[The Theatre Museum]], London (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

D'Auban married Warde's sister, Emma, in 1871, with whom he also performed.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; In the 1871 Christmas season, in the Harlequinade section of the pantomime ''Nip Van Winkle'' at the Pavilion Theatre, D'Auban played Harlequin, Emma was the "Harlequin ''à la'' Watteau", D'Auban's sister Marie was Columbine, and John Warde was Clown.&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 7 January 1872, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The next Christmas, D'Auban and Warde appeared together as the eponymous Valentine and Orson at the Elephant and Castle Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'' 29 December 1872, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; At the Gaiety, D'Auban appeared in and choreographed ''Fiz-Gig'', "a new pantomimic ballet" in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;Gaiety Theatre playbill, 23 January 1874&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comic opera; Drury Lane===
In 1876, D'Auban arranged the dances for the Gilbert and [[Frederic Clay]] [[comic opera]] ''[[Princess Toto]]'', starring [[Kate Santley]].&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877, D'Auban began working with [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], Gilbert and [[Arthur Sullivan]] by arranging the dances for their comic opera ''[[The Sorcerer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/sorcerer/html/making_sorcerer.html "The Making of the Sorcerer"] at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 15 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878, D'Auban trained Gilbert in his dances as [[Harlequin]] for the Harlequinade section of ''[[The Forty Thieves]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; D'Auban arranged the dances for the next [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] opera, ''[[H.M.S.

J. Byron]] at the Gaiety.&lt;ref&gt;Macqueen-Pope, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ruddigore Poster.jpg|left|thumb|300px|"In Sailing O'er Life's Ocean", a choreographed number from ''[[Ruddigore]]'', Act I (1887)]]
In 1880, D'Auban choreographed and appeared with his wife and sister in [[E. L. Blanchard]]'s pantomime of ''Mother Goose'' at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]].  Thereafter, until at least 1909, he was ballet-master and director at Drury Lane, especially of the pantomimes, where he also continued to perform in the Christmas pantomimes.  His son, Ernest Henry D'Auban (1874–1941), became the stage manager at Drury Lane for many years.  In 1881, D'Auban appeared in and arranged the dances for ''Robinson Crusoe'', followed in subsequent years by such Drury Lane pantomimes as ''Sinbad The Sailor'', ''Cinderella'' and ''Aladdin''.&lt;ref&gt;Theatre Royal, Drury Lane playbill, 26 December 1881&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, he choreographed ''[[Billee Taylor]]'' at the [[Royal Aquarium|Imperial Theatre]], [[Franz von Suppé]]'s ''Boccaccio'' for [[H.

In 1886, D'Auban choreographed ''Vetah'', a comic opera with a libretto by Kate Santley and music by [[Firmin Bernicat]] and Georges Jacobi, which toured the British provinces in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; He played Demonico in ''[[Frankenstein, or The Vampire's Victim]]'' in 1887 at the Gaiety and arranged the dances.&lt;ref name=behind&gt;[http://www.its-behind-you.com/drurylanepantos.html Drury Lane pantomime site] accessed 14 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He also choreographed ''[[Faust up to date]]'' by [[Meyer Lutz]], including his famous ballet music, a ''Pas de Quatre'' (1888), that became very popular and is still available today on CD.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00004WMWL "Pas de Quatre"], track 7 on ''British Light Music Classics'', Hyperion, 1996, accessed 15 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, he choreographed ''Cinderella; Or, Ladybird, Ladybird, Fly Away Home'' at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]]&lt;ref name=Cinderella&gt;[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/CAMELOT/cinder/cin8.htm Cinderella casts], accessed 14 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and both choreographed and appeared in ''Aladdin, and the Wonderful Lamp; or, The Willow Pattern plate and the Flying Crystal Palace'' at the Crystal Palace.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal Palace playbill, 26 December 1889&lt;/ref&gt; Other later Gaiety burlesques choreographed by D'Auban included ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]'' (1889) and ''[[Carmen Up to Data]]'' (1890).&lt;ref name=tm/&gt;

D'Auban continued to choreograph most of the Gilbert and Sullivan and other [[Savoy Theatre]] pieces throughout the 1880s and 1890s.  These included ''[[Iolanthe]]'' (1882),&lt;ref&gt;Savoy Theatre playbill, ''Iolanthe'', 25 November 1882&lt;/ref&gt;''[[Princess Ida]]'' (1884),&lt;ref name=tm/&gt; ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1885)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchivePressText/20021221.html ''The Mikado''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928132115/http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchivePressText/20021221.html |date=28 September 2011 }}, review in ''The Entr'acte'', London, 28 March 1885, p.6a, accessed at the ''Footlight Notes'' website, 21 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; (D'Auban is played by [[Andy Serkis]] in the 1999 film ''[[Topsy-Turvy]]'' concerning the making of ''The Mikado''), ''[[Ruddigore]]'' (1887),&lt;ref&gt;[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/ruddigore/html/rudd_cast.html Ruddigore cast information] at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 15 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' (1888),&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 6 October 1888, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Vicar of Bray]]'' (1892), ''[[Captain Billy]]'' (1892), ''[[Haddon Hall]]'' (1892),&lt;ref&gt;Trutt, David.

'''Josep Tapiró i Baró''' (17 February 1836, [[Reus]] - 4 October 1913, [[Tangier]]) was a Spanish painter; best known for his watercolor portraits from Morocco.

== Biography ==
His parents owned a hardware store. As with many future artists, he displayed an early affinity for drawing. His first formal studies were in 1849 with {{ill|Domènec Soberano|ca}}, a local wine merchant and amateur painter.&lt;ref name="P"&gt;[https://www.museodelprado.es/aprende/enciclopedia/voz/tapiro-y-baro-jose/267f41cc-f171-4e22-8b7f-10017c7b3ee8 Brief biography] @ the [[Museo del Prado]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, he and his fellow student, [[Marià Fortuny]], were given the opportunity to exhibit at a showing held by the Casino de Reus.

Later that year, he and Fortuny enrolled at the [[Escola de la Llotja]], where he studied with [[Claudi Lorenzale]], a painter associated with the German [[Nazarene movement]], among others.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt; At this time, he produced mostly historical and religious scenes. 
[[File:Tapiro 186x Nens sota porxada part 1814 resize.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Children Under the Porch, from his time in Rome.]]
In 1857 he, Fortuny and two others were given the opportunity to compete for a grant to study in Rome. Fortuny was chosen and Tapiró moved to Madrid, where he enrolled at the "Escuela Superior de Pintura y Grabado", a branch of the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]]. His instructor there was [[Federico de Madrazo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/t/tapiro.htm Biographical notes] @ Biografías y Vidas.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Barcelona in 1860 and assisted with decorating the façade at the [[Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya]]

In 1862, he joined his friend, Fortuny, in Rome and was introduced to his circle of artistic acquaintances who met at the [[Antico Caffè Greco]]. They also visited Naples and Florence together. While there, he took evening classes to learn how to paint watercolors and his works began to focus more on [[Genre art|genre]] themes. These works became very popular and established his reputation.

In 1871 he, Fortuny and [[Bernardo Ferrándiz Bádenes|Bernardo Ferrándiz]] took a trip to Tangier.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt; This would prove decisive for his career. In 1873, he held his first showing of [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] paintings at the "International Art Circle of Rome". Fortuny's sudden death in 1874 affected Tapiró deeply, and prompted his decision to leave Rome.
[[File:Tapiro 1913 retrat el Porvenir 1784 resize.jpg|thumb|160px|Photograph published in ''El Porvenir'', with his obituary.]]

===Living in Tangier===
Rather than remain in Spain, his memories of Tangier led him to join a diplomatic mission on its way to meet with Sultan [[Hassan I of Morocco|Hassan I]] in 1876. Once there, he moved into a newly-built home near the [[medina quarter]] and later acquired an old theater to serve as his studio.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt; Although he frequently travelled to exhibitions (as far afield as Saint Petersburg and New York) and spent the summers with his family in Reus, he would live in Tangier for the rest of his life.

In 1886, he married twenty-year-old Maria Manuela Valerega Cano, a Tangier native of Italian ancestry. Shortly after, a Jewish friend of Maria's died and they adopted her orphaned son.

In 1905, his career declined. He began having respiratory and cardiovascular problems due to a lung infection he had contracted in 1903, and often did not have enough energy to work. Travelling to promote his paintings also became very difficult. The situation was aggravated by a sharp decrease in the number of foreign visitors and tourists; caused by the rebellion of [[Bou Hmara]] and the [[Perdicaris incident]]. In 1907, he and his wife rented a house in Madrid in a last ditch effort to promote his work at an exhibition of the [[Círculo de Bellas Artes]].

His health problems eventually led to his death. His executor began a collection to defray the costs of a monument in his honor, but it was never created. Initially, he was buried in Tangier but, in 1921, the government of Reus demanded that he be recognized in his home town. In 1947, his remains were moved to Reus and reinterred near his friend, Fortuny. A plaque was placed on the house where he was born. In 2013, a joint retrospective was held at the {{ill|Museu d'Art i Història de Reus|ca}} and the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museunacional.cat/ca/josep-tapiro-pintor-de-tanger "Josep Tapiró.

'''Julian Ritter''' (September 19, 1909 – March 4, 2000) was an American painter of [[Poles in Germany|Polish-German]] descent who painted primarily nudes, clowns and portraits.

Ritter's paintings were typically rich in color. His nudes celebrated the glamor and beauty of the female form. All of his figurative paintings expressed the humanness in his subjects. He also painted landscapes at different points during his career and complex compositions dealing with mystical and spiritual subjects during his later years.

== Early life ==
Ritter was born '''Julian Stawski''' on September 19, 1909,&lt;ref name=Enlistment&gt;[https://aad.archives.gov/aad/record-detail.jsp?dt=893&amp;mtch=1&amp;cat=WR26&amp;tf=F&amp;q=Julian+Ritter&amp;bc=sl&amp;rpp=10&amp;pg=1&amp;rid=8056706 Julian Ritter Enlistment Record]. Electronic Army Serial Number Merged File, ca. 1938 − 1946. The National Archives. Retrieved 4/1/2011&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]],&lt;ref name="Splash"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.lasplash.com/publish/Film_106/julian-ritter-s-life-and-art-review.php|title=Julian Ritter's Life and Art Review - An unknown Artist of worldwide acclaim|work=Splash Magazines - Los Angeles|first=Greg |last=Autry|access-date=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the only child of an aspiring [[Poland|Polish]] actress.

Ritter settled in Los Angeles as a young adult. He held many menial jobs during this time - dishwasher, errand boy, order clerk. He also painted lamp shades and did freelance art.

Ritter moved to Chicago and began to take a serious interest in art.&lt;ref name="Splash"/&gt; He audited the night classes of Dr. Schroeder at the [[Chicago Art Institute]]. Ritter returned to Los Angeles where he later won a scholarship to the Art Center School (now, [[Art Center College of Design]]). He was introduced to figure painting under the tutelage of Stanley Reckless&lt;ref name="Splash"/&gt; who had studied at the Philadelphia Academy of Art and taught in the tradition of [[Frank Duveneck]] and the [[Munich School]]. This tradition involved the classical study of anatomy and used live models for subjects. The Munich School is characterized by a [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalistic]] style and dark [[chiaroscuro]].

While still a student at Art Center School, Ritter received the following positive review for a showing of his work at the Brice-Lowe Galleries:&lt;ref&gt;"Briefly Told Art Reviews: Review of Julian Ritter". ''[[Los Angeles Times]].'' October 4, 1931, pg B13.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Still another young artist holding his first local showing is Julian Ritter, whose water colors are at the Brice-Lowe Galleries. Of German birth he depicts various types and stages of man. Character is what interests him. His people are driven, by life or will. In one picture we see a procession of mendicants woefully singing or posing for sympathy, each a carefully studied type. In another a woman pushes the man who, in turn, pushes the wheelbarrow (his load) out on to the slender plank over the abyss. He has individual types of great interest: the old philosopher talking forever to a blank wall, the peasant woman going to church against the wind of life. Ritter's color is very delicate and helpful to his purpose, which is, however, mainly expressed through sensitive drawing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ritter graduated Art Center School in 1932 and found work at Los Angeles's film studios painting portraits for movie sets and doing other set design for Warner Brothers, MGM, Paramount and Universal. Ritter met the tall actress Francesca Chesley (1913–2004) in 1933. They were married on  December 16, 1934. She frequently modeled for his nude paintings. They divorced in 1943.&lt;ref name=POP&gt;[https://archive.is/20121213075859/http://lccn.loc.gov/91732278 Julian Ritter — Palette of passion] Library of Congress, Copyright collection. Washington, D.C. 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:julian ritter painting mural.png|thumb|alt=Julian Ritter painting mural for the Golden Gate International Exposition|Ritter painting a mural for the Mines, Minerals and Machinery Building of the 1939 [[Golden Gate International Exposition]] on San Francisco's Treasure Island]]
Ritter headed to San Francisco looking for work at the [[Golden Gate Exposition|Golden Gate International Exhibition]] of 1939. He was hired by architect Mark Daniels to paint murals for the Mines, Minerals and Machinery Building. These 90-foot murals  were a great success.&lt;ref name="Splash"/&gt; With money from the fair, Ritter returned to Los Angeles where he rented a small studio and began painting.&lt;ref name=POP /&gt;

Ritter exhibited at both the Gallery of Modern Art and the Newhouse Galleries in New York City during 1941.&lt;ref name="Splash"/&gt; Both exhibitions were critically acclaimed. The [[Art News]] (March 15, 1941) wrote: "His style shows fluency and ease" and Arts Digest (November 15, 1941) wrote: "Ritter is more than versatile, he is complex, exceptionally talented." Edward Alden Jewell of the  New York Times noted that Ritter's work was shown in the small entrance room of the Gallery of Modern Art, devoted to small oils, watercolors and gouaches in addition to the main exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;By Edward  Alden Jewell.  "FOUR ARTISTS SEEN AT NEW GALLERY : At the Modern Gallery". ''New York Times.'' November 4, 1941, pg 30.&lt;/ref&gt; New York Times art critic, H.D., wrote of the Newhouse Galleries exhibition:&lt;ref&gt;By H.D. "AMONG THE OTHER SHOWS". ''New York Times.'' Mar 16, 1941, pg X10&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Paintings and drawings by Julian Ritter, who has done portraits of movie stars, studied anatomy and been under contract to act in the films, may be seen at the Newhouse Galleries. This is rather flashy work with more than a little cleverness, and includes three paintings accompanied by poems—rather dire comments on life today.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The one-man show at the Newhouse Galleries was a particular success and led to portrait commissions. While attending a party thrown by a patron who commissioned a portrait of his daughter, Ritter got drunk and stripped off his clothes, calling the other attendees "phony baloneys".&lt;ref name=POP /&gt; He returned to Los Angeles.

Ritter met Hildegarde "Hilde" Sabena Meyer-Radon in 1942 when he saw her walking past his studio to take violin lessons from an instructor next door. Hilde had been born in Hamburg, Germany, on October 5, 1919; she immigrated to the US with her family in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;New York Passenger Lists, 1820-1957&lt;/ref&gt; Hilde's appreciation for the arts led to a very warm friendship between the two and they saw each other often.&lt;ref name=POP /&gt;

== World War II ==

General [[Ben Lear|Ben "Yoo Hoo" Lear]], commanding officer of the 2nd Army, in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], in 1943]]

At the US entrance into the war, Ritter wanted to enlist in the US Navy due to his love of the sea, his sense of adventure and his loyalty to his adopted country. However, since he was not a US citizen, the Navy would not let him enlist. However, he was drafted into the US Army in November 1942. He was assigned to the 40th Engineer Regiment&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.40thengineers.org World War II 40th Combat Engineers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621133756/http://40thengineers.org/ |date=2011-06-21 }}. Retrieved 4/1/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; which was organized in [[Fort Pickett|Camp Pickett, Virginia]], attached to the 45th Infantry Division which was part of General [[George Patton]]'s 7th Army. Ritter was initially a member of the 3rd Battalion which trained at Fort Lewis, Washington.

While at Camp Pickett, Ritter was selected to paint a portrait of Lt. General [[Ben Lear|Ben "Yoo-Hoo" Lear]] who was the commanding officer of the 2nd Army based in Tennessee. Ritter asked Hilde to come join him at Memphis, and he asked her to marry him.&lt;ref name="Splash"/&gt; Because there was no waiting period for a marriage license in Mississippi, Hilde and Ritter traveled the next morning to Hernando, Mississippi, where they got a license and were married in a small chapel on April 9, 1943. The two had a six-week honeymoon in a Memphis hotel room while he completed the painting of General Lear. After the portrait was complete, Ritter returned to Camp Pickett but was reassigned to the 1st Battalion which was later re-designated as the 2829th Battalion.&lt;ref name=POP /&gt;

The 40th Engineers received additional training at Fort Pierce, Florida, and then deployed to the Gulf of Oran, Algeria, for further training. He took part in the [[invasion of Sicily]].

Based on his military service, Ritter became a US citizen on October 30, 1943.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Naturalization Record Indexes, 1791-1992&lt;/ref&gt; He attained the rank of [[Technician Fourth Grade]] (T4) and served at both Regimental headquarters and the headquarters of the 1st/2829th Battalion.

In October 1945 Ritter returned to Los Angeles to paint and to raise a family.

== Post-war Southern California ==

=== 1945 to 1966 ===
When Ritter first returned from the war, he found himself unable to paint anything but morbid, gruesome paintings of death, darkness and despair for about a year. After this he began his most prolific period. He would regularly work long hours and he became known for his fine nude studies and clowns.

Ritter and Hilde had two children while living in Hollywood: Christine was born in 1947 and Michael in 1948.&lt;ref name="Splash"/&gt;

Art critic Arthur Miller of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote in a 1947 review of Ritter's one-man show at the James Vigeveno Galleries in Westwood, California:&lt;ref&gt;By Arthur Miller. "Ritter Work Has Merit".  ''Los Angeles Times''. May 25, 1947, pg. C4.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Julian Ritter, still-young painter and etcher who has not shown here in many years, has a large exhibit at the James Vigeveno Galleries to June 12. It shows him remarkably gifted and various.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some will like his many paintings of girls or nudes, done in charming colors, or his characterful portraits of older folk or children. Others may prefer his slightly sardonic, action-packed grotesques of circus clowns or of merely comical people. He also can turn deeply serious with "Refugees" or "Slums."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 1948 "Brush Strokes" column in the ''Los Angeles Time''s commented:&lt;ref&gt;"BRUSH STROKES". ''Los Angeles Times.''  Jun 13, 1948, pg C4&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Julian Ritter's paintings of clowns, on view in the gallery at 401 S Lake Ave., Pasadena, are notable for liveliness of expression and color. Ritter has chosen to paint clowns, he explains, because 'In the clown one sees all the emotions a man can express; to record him is to depict humanity itself.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ritter moved the family to Don Pio Drive in Woodland Hills, California, in the early 1950s. The home included a studio building on a hilltop which, like all his studios, featured a pot-belly stove. In addition to his painting, Ritter was a talented landscaper and he terraced the front and rear hills with steps, paths and pools all made from slabs of broken concrete.

At the urging of his brother-in-law, Stewart Potter, Ritter began selling his paintings in Las Vegas in February, 1950. The two made the trip from Los Angeles to Las Vegas in Ritter's 1949 Dodge Wayfarer, a yellow convertible with no rear seat and an extended trunk which would be packed with paintings. The two went from casino to casino without any success until they met Bill Moore, the owner of the Hotel Last Frontier. Ritter sold Moore 13 framed nudes for $1000 which would become the basis of the Silver Slipper Collection of paintings. Ritter and Potter would make additional trips to Las Vegas and sold additional paintings to the Hotel Last Frontier and its adjoining [[Silver Slipper|Silver Slipper Casino]]. They also sold paintings to other hotels, casinos and their employees.&lt;ref name=POP /&gt;

Shortly after this, Otto Eitel, owner of the Bismarck Hotel which was at the center of Chicago's Loop entertainment district, invited Ritter to do a one-man show at the Swiss Chalet Galleries&lt;ref name="Splash"/&gt; and to paint a mural for the Bismarck Inn. This show was successful and led to numerous commissions including the "Mr Whimsey" clowns for the U.O. Colson Company. Ritter's wife and children stayed in Chicago with him for several months while he completed his commissions.&lt;ref name=POP /&gt;

Ritter was enjoying success with his clown and nude paintings but, at the same time, he felt trapped by this success. He was not painting the great works he imagined. For inspiration, in 1956 he moved his family to Mexico, primarily living in San Blas, Nayarit, a small town on the Pacific Coast of Mexico located between Mazatlan and  Puerto Vallarta. Ritter wrote in a note published in the ''Los Angeles Times'' "the place is a paradise for landscape painters and living is cheap."&lt;ref&gt;"NEWS AND VIEWS OF ART". ''Los Angeles Times.'' Feb 17, 1957, pg. E5&lt;/ref&gt; Ritter said later, "My time in San Blas was important to me. I developed a new conception of color and a self-assurance which made me a better painter."&lt;ref name=POP /&gt;

After nearly a year in San Blas, Ritter returned to California in 1957 and purchased the house at 2321 Edgewater Way in the Santa Barbara Mesa neighborhood. Ritter again turned the yard into a remarkable garden.

Hilde worked at the noted [[Brooks Institute|Brooks Institute of Photography]] while Ritter continued to paint steadily as his paintings commanded higher values. Most importantly, Ritter was, at last, free to paint the works he wanted to.  Ritter's work was represented in continuing exhibitions at the Poulsen Galleries&lt;ref name=Ad91&gt;Display Ad 91 -- "Poulsen Galleries". ''Los Angeles Times''. December 1, 1963, pg B34&lt;/ref&gt; in Pasadena and at frequent showings at the James Vigeveno Gallery in Westwood.&lt;ref name=Ad27&gt;Display Ad 27 -- "James Vigeveno Gallery".  ''Los Angeles Times.'' May 18, 1947,  pg B4&lt;/ref&gt; He was also represented in San Francisco by the Maxwell Galleries and the Kotzbeck Gallery, and by galleries in Palm Springs and Scottsdale. Ritter was at the height of his commercial success but he disliked that the galleries were making money that he felt should be going to him. He had always had a somewhat stormy relationship with his dealers and preferred to deal directly with collectors. About this time, Ritter successfully set out to build a group of patrons who could provide financial security and independence, however, many of these collectors were demanding the familiar nudes and clowns that Ritter had tired of.&lt;ref name=POP /&gt;

In 1958, the Circus company in Los Angeles published and distributed five reproductions of mounted 8x10 inch paintings. The paintings included the clowns Dilly, Flim, Flam, Helter and Skelter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120712233105/http://lccn.loc.gov/2005684571 Portraits of clowns &amp;#91;graphic&amp;#93;]. 5 reproductions of paintings ; mounted 8 x 10 in. Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division, Washington D.C. 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Ritter had a show at the Poulsen Galleries in Pasadena, California. It was generally well-received with Scott McClean, the gallery director, stating "This is probably the first exhibit to show the whole range and variety of the work of a man who has been known for two specialties – nudes and clowns. I think this broader view of Julian Ritter's work is long overdue."&lt;ref name=POP /&gt;

But not all reviews of Ritter's work were glowing. A 1964 ''Los Angeles Times'' review of the same exhibit by Constance Perkins stated:&lt;ref&gt;By Constance Perkins. "WIDE SCOPE OF ART ON VIEW IN POULSEN GALLERIES SHOW". ''Los Angeles Times.''  Jan 3, 1964, pg. C5&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...[Ritter's] fame rests largely on his sensual paintings of the nude figure. Second in popularity are Ritter's clowns. From any aesthetic viewpoint, both the pink nudes and the clowns become ingratiatingly sickly, redundant and commercially dull although technically capable enough. Almost unknown are the artist's portrait pieces and a series of both large canvases and small abstract drawings in which the surreal element is dominant. The portraits are traditional and the most genuine. The drawings become very 'slick.' The large canvases, on the other hand, tend to be too personal and too involved in allegory to hold as significant statements.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1964, Hilde had been sick for a year but refused to see a doctor. When she collapsed, Ritter insisted and doctors discovered she had cancer.&lt;ref name="Splash"/&gt; She had a mastectomy and
struggled for two years before succumbing to the disease. Hilde died January 22, 1966.&lt;ref&gt;California Death Index, 1940-1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritter began drinking heavily. He later said, "I became a lousy cowardly drunk after my wife died. I had no respect for myself - morally, physically or spiritually. My mind and my body and my inner-self were too tired to conceive anything. I was burnt out."&lt;ref name=POP /&gt;

=== 1966 to 1985 ===
[[File:Galilee in puntarenas harbor.tiff|right|thumb|alt=Ritter aboard his 45-foot yawl, Galilee, in the harbor at Puntarenas, Costa Rica|Ritter aboard his 45-foot yawl, ''Galilee'', in the harbor at [[Puntarenas]], [[Costa Rica]].]]

During 1965–66, Ritter painted a portrait of 17-year-old Lauren "Laurie" Kokx. He felt that he needed to get away from the Edgewater Way house that held so many memories of his wife, so he sold the house and its contents for $37,000.&lt;ref name="Splash"/&gt; He bought a custom-built yawl still under construction in [[Morro Bay, California]].&lt;ref name=4rescued&gt;By Shearlean Duke. "4 RESCUED; Ship Runs Into Bad Luck--Again 'Bewitched' Ship Runs Into Bad Luck Again".  ''Los Angeles Times''. February 7, 1976, p. OC1&lt;/ref&gt; Ritter named the boat ''Galilee'', and with the assistance of a two-man crew, on February 2, 1968,&lt;ref&gt;"Seagoing Art Studio". ''Santa Barbara News-Press.'' February 3, 1968, p A-3&lt;/ref&gt; he sailed it to various ports including [[Acapulco]], Mexico, where he was joined by Kokx. They sailed to Puntarenas, Costa Rica, where he painted for six months. He then sailed to the [[Galapagos Islands]], [[Tahiti]], [[Moorea]] and [[Bora Bora]], sketching tropical scenes for later development as paintings. In December, 1968, a show was mounted at the Bernard Gallery in Los Angeles of works painted in Puntarenas that Ritter had sent home.&lt;ref name=POP /&gt;

With Kokx and another crew member, Ritter left Bora Bora for [[Hawaii]] on June 17, 1970, expecting a 30-day voyage. Serious problems arose with the boat's equipment, and it began to take on sea water. Continually bailing, Ritter and his crew drifted for 87 days, running out of food and water, fearing death.&lt;ref name="Splash"/&gt; On September 14, 1970, the ''Galilee'' was rescued by the U.S. Navy combat stores ship, [[USS Niagara Falls|USS ''Niagara Falls'']].&lt;ref&gt;"On Rescue ship". ''Los Angeles Times'.' September 18, 1970, p. C4.&lt;/ref&gt; Ship's doctor Philip A. Becker described the emaciated crew members as "living skeletons only four days away from death."&lt;ref name=4rescued /&gt;&lt;ref name=bewitched&gt;By Shearlean Duke. "The Galilee: Is It a Boat Bewitched?" ''Los Angeles Times.'' February 21, 1974, p. D1&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritter and Kokx recuperated in Hawaii for a month, then returned to California. Although he was still recovering and underweight, Ritter gave a three-hour talk at a Los Angeles gallery about being lost at sea. In attendance were family members, patrons and his first wife.

Ritter appeared on the TV game show ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'' along with two "impostor" contestants and the celebrity panelists in an episode that aired December 22, 1970. All three of the panelists picked Ritter since he was the only one of the three contestants who looked like he had been lost at sea without food.&lt;ref&gt;Sunday TV Guide. ''Los Angeles Times.'' December 20, 1970, pg L16&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritter donated six of his clown paintings for an auction to raise money for a group working for the release of American prisoners of war held in North Vietnam. The auction was held mid-December 1970. Among the guests of honor was [[Francis Gary Powers]] whose U-2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union. One painting, a 24x36 oil, was reportedly sold for $3600. Ritter made the contribution out of sympathy for the prisoners and their families and personal gratitude to the Navy for his rescue.&lt;ref&gt;"ART NEWS :'Helix' Show Due at UCLA". ''Los Angeles Times.'' December 20, 1970, pg M61&lt;/ref&gt; Ritter said "I know what deprivation is after that ordeal. I can relate to the terrible suffering of those POWs."&lt;ref&gt;"Art Auction Raises Funds to Help POWs". ''Los Angeles Times.'' December 14, 1970, pg SG6&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritter and Kokx settled into a house in rural [[Summerland, California|Summerland]] outside Santa Barbara for 15 years.&lt;ref name="Splash"/&gt; Ritter's near-death experience catalyzed two years of intense painting. During this period, Ritter was arguably at the peak of his artistic expression. He was already a fulfilled artist who saw himself as a maestro and people treated him accordingly. His subject matter included paintings which were more mystical as he worked out the demons from the voyage, his loss of Hilde and his own alcoholism. To meet the demands of his collectors and his need for money, Ritter continued painting nudes, portraits and occasional clown compositions.&lt;ref name=POP /&gt;

Ritter had a show in late 1975 at the Howard E. Morseburg Galleries on Wilshire in Los Angeles which included some of this new work. The show was called "Julian's World" and consisted of 101 paintings and 16 drawings.&lt;ref name="Splash"/&gt; This was Ritter's last major public exhibit. One painting which did stand out was a crucifixion: Ritter had posed and was photographed and then painted himself onto the cross in a self-portrait.&lt;ref name=POP /&gt;

Ritter preferred to sell directly to collectors so he could make more money. Ritter had a sufficient number of patrons at this point in his life so that he no longer needed to rely on gallery showings. However, many of these patrons were most interested in his commercial nudes and clowns rather than the more artistic paintings.&lt;ref name=POP /&gt;

==Hawaii==
In the summer of 1984, Ritter and Kokx separated.&lt;ref name=POP /&gt; In 1985, Ritter and his son Michael moved into a house in [[Kula, Hawaii]], on the island of Maui. He suffered a debilitating stroke in December 1985. After a period of convalescence, Ritter began painting again. Although the stroke limited his painting ability, he wrote and he taught painting.&lt;ref name=POP /&gt;

In 1989,  Michael commissioned a 30-minute video  about the life and art of his father, titled ''Julian Ritter—Palette of passion''. It was written and produced by Keith Gilchrist and was filmed and directed by Christopher Gentsch.&lt;ref name=POP /&gt;

Ritter died at home on March 4, 2000, at the age of 90.

== Religion and politics ==
Ritter was raised a [[Roman Catholic]] although he was not religious in his adult life — Ritter led the life of a hedonistic artist. Some family members recount that he did frequent Catholic churches to reflect. Although his paintings were not overtly religious, many of his works did have a mystical quality. One example is "The Clown Funeral".  In it, clowns are bearing one of their own, eyes closed but wearing a beautiful clown smile. Ritter appears in self-portrait in the painting. Some compare this painting to El Greco's "[[El Entierro Del Conde De Orgaz]]" ("The Burial of the Count of Orgaz").{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

== Friends and patrons ==
Ritter had a number of interesting friends. George Morgan, the son of [[Frank Morgan]] (''The Wizard of Oz''), who was wealthy from the family business distributing Angostura Bitters, was a drinking buddy.  John Coleman, who taught at Art Center, and his family were also close friends who visited the Edgewater Way house frequently.

Ritter befriended Chick Rosenthal who lived in the same Hollywood bungalows in the 1930s and maintained that friendship until Rosenthal's death. Rosenthal accompanied Ritter to New York in a van in 1941 when Ritter was offered the one-man show at the Newhouse Galleries.&lt;ref name=POP /&gt;

Ritter began a long-term friendship with Rudolph Axford&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.argonautnewspaper.com/articles/2007/09/27/news_-_features/venice/v4.txt (Rudolph Axford dies at 79; Venice activist, boat restorer") ]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; from Venice, California, in the mid-1950s. Axford shared Ritter's conservative politics and love of boats, and was a Ritter patron who accumulated many pieces of his work.

Greg Autry was another friend and patron. Autry met Ritter in 1983 after he purchased a fake Ritter in a Laguna Beach gallery. Autry both commissioned paintings and purchased other examples of Ritter's work. Autry purchased the Silver Slipper collection of Ritter's paintings from the Summa Corporation in a closed-bid auction in the late 1980s.

== Art ==
Although Ritter was best known for his oil paintings of nudes, clowns and portraits, he also worked in other media including pen-and-ink with watercolor, charcoal and [[Conté|Conté crayons]] and painted other subjects including portraits, landscapes, and complex compositions. He also liked doing caricature, often drawing cartoons rather than sending letters to friends. Ritter's style changed over the course of his life.

Art historian and award-winning author Phyllis Settacase Barton wrote of Ritter:&lt;ref name=POP /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Labeling the work of Julian Ritter is not easy because his genius is not readily defined. This is because for most of his life he has painted women as though he were exploring a garden – with eyes, lips and nipples painted like blue, red and pink blossoms. His earlier work also includes lots of clowns, many of which he painted with introspection and compassion – generally to the exclusion of their surroundings – telling us that his mind, heart and eye were in league with the human being beneath the costume, behind the make-up. As an adventurer into human nature, he painted portraits, each flavored with the spirit of the sitter, each embodying the effervescence of the cycle of life. In viewing all of these paintings – nudes, clowns, portraits – we begin to become aware that Julian Ritter has been on a journey – not just a physical journey – but a speculative one in which he has really been exploring himself. But the quintessential Julian Ritter comes to us through a series of sumptuously painted, monumental pictures which I choose to call lifescapes. His promethean story about how he has travelled from spiritual darkness into the shimmering world of rapture. Julian's magnificent vertical work which he calls 'The Black Hole' tells us the story of Julian's transgression and his penance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One example of a mixed-media watercolor and chalk is "Bachelor's Housekeeping" painted in 1939. The painting was at the DeYoung Museum in San Francisco in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deyoung.famsf.org/search-collections  DeYoung Museum] Advanced "Search by Artist" for Julian Ritter. Retrieved April 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritter had a steady presence in the Los Angeles art scene with exhibitions and showings from 1947 through 1975 when he had his last major gallery showing at the Howard E. Morseburg Galleries in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Splash"/&gt; His work was typically on display in any given week at some gallery in Southern California as evidenced through display ads in the ''Sunday Los Angeles Times''.&lt;ref name=Ad91 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ad27 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Display Ad 86 -- "Art Center Gallery". ''Los Angeles Times.'' October 13, 1963, pg B29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Display Ad 173 -- "Bell Gallery". ''Los Angeles Times.'' May 10, 1970, pg C43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Display Ad 450 -- "Howard E.

April 22, 1984, pg L86&lt;/ref&gt; He was also frequently listed in the Calendar section of the Los Angeles Times.&lt;ref&gt;"NEW EXHIBITS". ''Los Angeles Times.'' December 12, 1948, pg D4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"This Week's Calendar". ''Los Angeles Times.'' December 15, 1963, pg B14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Calendar of Events". ''Los Angeles Times.'' January 21, 1965, pg SG12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"This Week's Calendar". ''Los Angeles Times.'' February 13, 1966, pg B14&lt;/ref&gt; After this, Ritter had a sufficient number of patrons to support his lifestyle without the need for gallery showings.

=== Portraits ===
Ritter painted a number of prominent Californians. He also painted many actors, especially while employed at Warner Brothers where he would paint an actor in his current role. For instance, he painted [[Paul Muni]] in his role as Zola in ''The Life of [[Emile Zola]]''. He also painted [[Ruby Keeler]], [[Clara Bow]], [[Claudette Colbert]], [[Olivia de Havilland]] and [[Veronica Lake]].&lt;ref name=POP /&gt;

=== Nudes and showgirls ===
Ritter painted several variations of the horizontal nude pose. Other nudes include paintings of Janet Boyd, a successful Las Vegas showgirl,&lt;ref name="Splash"/&gt; who he also painted as a showgirl in his painting "The Gibson Girl." Boyd later wrote to Ritter: "...I only got to be with you a few years but wonderful memories I have and will cherish. Not every girl gets to be a Ritter model. I loved every moment posing for you. The early mornings working in the studio in Santa Barbara are happy memories for me. And because your works of me will keep me young and beautiful forever."&lt;ref name=POP /&gt; There were many other nudes using various models.

Ritter painted a number of nudes of his first wife, the actress Francesca Chesley. Ritter also painted a couple of nudes of his second wife, Hilde. The latter remain in the family collection.

He also painted many showgirl paintings, the most famous of which is "Ruby," a painting of an African-American girl. He made several showgirl paintings using a model named LeeAnn which were also commercially successful.

=== Clowns ===
Although he had painted clowns before, Ritter started painting a series of unusual or tender clowns in the summer of 1948. His first visit to a circus was in 1949. Ritter said of his clown paintings "I don't need to see clowns. My clown portraits are more like human portraits in clown make-up. They are a combination of my imagination and my memory of faces, or even my own face."&lt;ref name=POP /&gt;

Ritter was commissioned in the early 1950s by an art gallery on Ventura Blvd in the San Fernando Valley to paint a set of small 8"x10" clowns called the Helter Skelter Clowns. The clowns included Dilly, Dally, Flim, Flam, Pitter, Patter and Helter and Skelter. These were reproduced for the mass market in 1958.

Ritter also painted a series of clowns based on "Mr. Whimsey," a clown with his dog. The U.O. Colson Company of Illinois commissioned Ritter to paint a set of these paintings for a calendar. He painted several more "Mr. Whimsey" paintings, some of which were part of the Silver Slipper collection.&lt;ref name="Splash"/&gt;

Ritter also painted a number of clown compositions featuring groups of clowns (e.g.,"Clown Band and "Clown Funeral") and clown with nude or showgirl montages. Some of these feature a single clown with his arm around a showgirl, others portrayed a single nude surrounded by a variety of clowns and others were groups of clowns.

Ritter tired of painting his commercially successful clowns and made the painting "Clown Funeral" to announce the end of his clown paintings. After that, he painted only the occasional clown composition or a clown painting commissioned by a patron.&lt;ref name=POP /&gt;

=== Landscapes ===
Although he was known primarily as a figurative painter, Ritter painted a number of landscapes, particularly when he was in San Blas, Mexico, and when he made his Pacific voyage. Ritter said of the San Blas paintings that they informed him with a new sense of color. The South Pacific seemed to further transform Ritter's paintings in much the same manner as it had on [[Paul Gauguin]] decades earlier. Though these never achieved the commercial success of his nudes and clowns, they were arguably amongst his best paintings.&lt;ref name=POP /&gt;

=== Lifescapes ===
Ritter was a man who lived in his emotions. His paintings have been described as a "visual record of his emotional life." Nowhere is this more true than in the paintings art historian Phyllis Settacase Barton called "lifescapes."

It could be argued that the first of these lifescapes were the clown compositions. The painting, "Clown Band" is no less a joyful presentation of life than Ritter's later work, "God's Children." "Clown Funeral" was a deeply introspective look with Ritter, in self-portrait, carrying the body of a fallen clown - his announcement that he was no longer interested in painting the clowns that had brought him so much commercial success. The montages of clown with either nudes or showgirls shows the duality in all of us - the sensuality and eroticism of the female form with the detached folly of the accompanying clown(s).

But the true lifescapes were those works that Ritter painted when he had the patronage that allowed him to eschew dealing with galleries - Ritter finally started painting the great compositions which he saw in his visions. These works were described as "mystical looks into the core of existence and the meaning of life." Many of these were painted during and after the voyage that almost took his life but which also opened his mind and heart to see deeper and more introspective subjects and expressions. Paintings of the voyage revealed the absolute terror in the hollowed-out eyes of the subjects. The mystical paintings revealed a faith that higher powers were at work.

One critic wrote "Julian is a man who has seen life, absorbed it and now presents it." Sweeping and majestic paintings presented the very essence of Ritter's emotions. "The Carousel" was a complicated composition exploring man's spiritual nature. Ritter dealt with man's hypocrisy in "The Sunday Preacher". Ritter's "Man on the Cross" was a deeply personal view into Ritter's emotions as he painted his self-portrait onto the cross. One critic wrote of the piece: "Undoubtedly, it is a daring and modern interpretation of life. It is a work which will cause considerable controversy. But what great artist hasn't caused that? What artist of any note has not or will not speak his own mind through his pictures?"&lt;ref name=POP /&gt;

When Ritter and Kokx separated in the summer of 1984, Ritter's work became more dark expressing the aloneness he felt in his partner's absence.

Ritter's work changed again when he went to Maui, building again on the spiritual. Art historian Phyllis Settacase Barton wrote of these paintings: "In the glowing panoramic scenes, powerfully and prayerfully, Julian Ritter lets us in on some of his most intimate secrets, eases us into his precious discoveries and shares with us deepest concerns."&lt;ref name=POP /&gt;

=== Silver Slipper Casino collection ===
The Silver Slipper Casino collection started in February, 1950 when Ritter sold 13 framed nude paintings for $1000 to Bill Moore, the owner of the Last Frontier Hotel. By 1962, 33 paintings of nudes, showgirls, clowns and clown/nude montages adorned the walls of the upstairs theater.

On April 4, 1955, the Last Frontier Hotel became the New Frontier Hotel under the management Jacob Kozloff. In 1967, Howard Hughes bought both the New Frontier Hotel and the Silver Slipper Casino.&lt;ref name="Splash"/&gt;

After Hughes' death, Howard Hughes' Summa Corporation sold both the Silver Slipper Casino and the Frontier Hotel to the Elardi family in 1988 and divested itself of its contents including the paintings which were auctioned off in a closed-bid auction. Greg Autry won the auction and continues to hold the collection which has not been seen for many years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cctn.ccgtcc.com/LV%20Strip%20The%20Early%20Years.pdf The Las Vegas Strip: The Early Years.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708125959/http://cctn.ccgtcc.com/LV%20Strip%20The%20Early%20Years.pdf |date=2011-07-08 }} Retrieved May 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Low-level design''' (LLD) is a component-level design process that follows a step-by-step [[refinement (computing)|refinement]] process. This process can be used for designing data structures, required software architecture, source code and ultimately, performance algorithms. Overall, the data organization may be defined during requirement analysis and then refined during data design work. Post-build, each component is specified in detail.&lt;ref name="Pressman2005"&gt;{{cite book|first=Roger S. |last=Pressman|title=Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=bL7QZHtWvaUC}}|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-07-301933-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LLD phase is the stage where the actual software components are designed.

During the detailed phase the logical and functional design is done and the design of application structure is developed during the high-level design phase.

== Design phase ==

A design is the order of a system that connects individual components. Often, it can interact with other systems. Design is important to achieve high reliability, low cost, and good maintain-ability.&lt;ref name="BellMorrey1997"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Doug |last1=Bell|first2=Ian |last2=Morrey|first3=John R. |last3=Pugh|title=The Essence of Program Design|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=893K9g5JNn8C}}|year=1997|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-367806-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
We can distinguish two types of program design phases:

* Architectural or [[high-level design]]
* Detailed or low-level design

[[Flowchart|Structured flow charts]] and [[HIPO model|HIPO]] diagrams typify the class of [[software design tools]] and these provide a high-level overview of a program. The advantages of such a design tool is that it yields a design specification that is understandable to nonprogrammers and it provides a good pictorial display of the module dependencies.

A disadvantage is that it may be difficult for software developers to go from graphic-oriented representation of software design to implementation. Therefore, it is necessary to provide little insight into the algorithmic structure describing procedural steps to facilitate the early stages of software development (generally using [[Program Design Language|PDL]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Survey of Program Design Languages (PDLs): Brian A. Nejmeh, Herbert E. Dunsmore&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==

The goal of LLD or a low-level design document (LLDD) is to give the internal logical design of the actual program code. Low-level design is created based on the high-level design. LLD describes the class diagrams with the methods and relations between classes and program specs. It describes the modules so that the programmer can directly code the program from the document.

A good low-level design document makes the program easy to develop when proper analysis is utilized to create a low-level design document. The code can then be developed directly from the low-level design document with minimal debugging and testing.
Other advantages include lower cost and easier maintenance.

== Sample ==
You can find an example of HLD here: [http://www.agiledata.org/essays/agileDataModeling.html#Figure1 Sample HLD], after iterations that was initially developed as LLD:[http://www.agiledata.org/essays/agileDataModeling.html#Iteration6 Sample LLD].

'''''Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence''''' is an early sculpture by the Italian artist [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]. It depicts the saint at the moment of his martyrdom, being burnt alive on a [[Gridiron (cooking)|gridiron]]. According to Bernini's biographer, [[Filippo Baldinucci]], the sculpture was completed when Bernini was 15 years old, implying it was finished in the year 1614.&lt;ref name="baldinucci"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baldinucci |first=Filippo |editor=Catherine Enggass |title=Vita Del Cavaliere Gio. Lorenzo Bernino |publisher=Nabu Press |location= |page=12 |year=1966 |isbn=978-1-148-63920-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians have dated the sculpture between 1615 and 1618. A date of 1617 seems most likely.&lt;ref name="coliva"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coliva |first=Caterina |title=Bernini scultore: La tecnica esecutiva |publisher=De Luca Editori d'Arte |location= |year=2002 |isbn=978-88-8016-506-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is less than life-size in dimensions, measuring 108 by 66&amp;nbsp;cm.

The sculpture is now held in the [[Uffizi]] in [[Florence]] as part of the Contini Bonacossi Collection.

==Commission==
There is some confusion over the patronage of the sculpture. Filippo Baldinucci simply wrote it was done for Leone Strozzi, a Florentine nobleman living in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="baldinucci"/&gt; Bernini’s son, [[Domenico| Domenico Bernini]], who wrote a biography of his father, paints a more complex picture, suggesting that Bernini executed the sculpture out of his devotion for the saint rather than for a specific commission.&lt;ref name="bernini"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bernini |first=Domenico |editor=Franco Mormando |title=The Life of Giano Lorenzo Bernini |publisher=Penn State University Press |location=University Park |page=15 |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-271-03748-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michela Uliva suggests this may be true, with Bernini's supporter [[Pope Urban VIII|Cardinal Maffeo Barberni]] enthusing the artist with the burgeoning post-Tridentine interest in early [[Christian martyrs]].&lt;ref name="coliva"/&gt;

Recent historians tend to agree with Domenico Bernini's statement that Leone Strozzi was impressed by the sculpture and acquired it for his Villa del Viminale. Irving Lavin suggests that Strozzi may have become familiar with the work as he was commissioning a chapel in the church of [[Sant'Andrea della Valle]] at the same time as Cardinal Maffeo Barberini, particularly as the Strozzi Chapel included a tomb dedicated to Cardinal [[Lorenzo Strozzi]] (who died in [[Avignon]] in 1571) and bore the same name as the saint.&lt;ref name="lavin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lavin |first=Irving |title=Visible Spirit: The Art of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Volume 1 |publisher=Pindar Press |location= |page=69 |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-899828-39-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the statue is included in Strozzi inventory in 1632, described as a "San Lorenzo above a modern gridiron".&lt;ref name="lavin"/&gt;

==Creation==
The sculpture was created from a single block of [[Carrara]] marble. Restoration in 1997 revealed that Bernini used different tools to create different surface textures on various parts of the sculpture. The reverse side of the gridiron has not been polished and finished in the same way as the front, implying that the artwork was clearly meant to be seen from the front only.&lt;ref name="coliva"/&gt; A highly sculpted pedestal, made of wood and gilded with golden paint, was designed as a platform for the sculpture.&lt;ref name ="coliva"/&gt; There is a possibility this was also executed by Bernini, although its design suggests that while it was a Strozzi family commission, it was done at a later date.&lt;ref name="bernardini"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Bernardini, Maria Grazia |editor2=Maurizio Fagiolo dell'Arco |title=Gian Lorenzo Bernini: Regista del barocco  |publisher=Skira |location= |page=186 |year=1999 |isbn=978-88-8118-484-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and interpretation==

===Subject===
The subject of the artwork is [[St Lawrence|Lawrence of Rome]], who was condemned to death by the Roman Emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] in the year 258 C.E. for defending the Christian faith. According to tradition, Lawrence was burnt to death by being placed on a gridiron.

In depicting a highly naturalistic St Lawrence, tortured and yet undergoing some kind of spiritual epiphany, the sculpture presents a taste of many of the themes that Bernini would adopt during the course of his artistic oeuvre, and that would come to represent many of the most pertinent features of the artistic traditions in Italian Baroque art—that of solitary figures undergoing intense emotional states, whilst being depicted with illusionistic verisimilitude. Unlike earlier depictions of Lawrence, there are no other figures—no sign of his judge, torturers or spectators witnessing in depth. Rather the focus is solely on the martyr and his emotional state.

===Saint Lawrence's emotional state===
Commentators have subtly varied in describing and interpreting the face of Lawrence. Domenico Bernini contextualised the creation with the anecdote that Bernini placed his actual hand in a flame and fashioned Lawrence’s expression from his own facial reaction seen in a mirror; thus implying that the focus of the portrait of Lawrence would be the physical pain.&lt;ref name="bernini"/&gt;

Yet later commentators have described Lawrence's face not as one of pain, but of being "tired" or more commonly of being spiritual rapt. To Howard Hibbard, the sculpture makes a clear religious statement of spiritual salvation—inner strength overcomes external bodily pain.&lt;ref name="hibbard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hibbard |first=Howard |title=Bernini |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-14-013598-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, observation of the sculpture seems to bear this out. The martyr almost turns away from the pain, his upper body and head reaching upwards towards the skies, with his clear, almost peaceful eyes, focussed in the direction of God.

Others take Bernini's depiction of Lawrence even further: describing the martyr as being "reclined on his left elbow languidly as any Roman banqueter", and thwarting his torturers with "a carved attitude of rapture".&lt;ref name="spivey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spivey |first=Nigel |title=Enduring Creation: Art, Pain, and Fortitude |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-520-23022-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another art historian, Avigdor Poseq, interprets the expression a little differently: “the calm face was apparently meant to convey the intensive of the martyr’s fear of God.” He continues by suggesting that Bernini presented Lawrence with an outstretched to hand to indicate the martyr’s desire to be turned over by his torturers, thus exposing even more of his flesh to the flames below.&lt;ref name="poseq"&gt;{{cite book|last=Poseq |first=Avigdor |title=Bernini Revisited: New Insights into His Work |publisher=Academon |location= |year=2008 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical excellence===
Twentieth-century commentators have largely agreed on the technical excellence of the sculpture. [[Rudolf Wittkower]] speaks of the “high degree of technical perfection [and] the anatomical precision and an infallible sense for the organic coherence and structure of the human body.”&lt;ref name="wittkower"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wittkower |first=Rudolf |title=Gian Lorenzo Bernini: The Sculptor of the Roman Baroque |publisher=Phaidon Press |location=London |year=1955 |page=3 |isbn=978-0-7148-3715-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irving Lavin sees, in the flesh-like quality achieved with the marble, a criticism of Michelangelo, who mastered design and anatomy but not the appearance of flesh.&lt;ref name="preimesberger"&gt;{{cite book|last=Preimesberger |first=Rudolf |editor=Irving Lavin |title=Gianlorenzo Bernini: New Aspects of His Art and Thought |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |location=University Park |year=1985 |isbn=978-0-271-00387-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flames also receive attention. During the baroque period, the ability to represent to recreate nature, as in flames, water, flesh, in illusionistic marble would be a frequent challenge. Bernini's "attempt to represent leaping flames in sculpture is a tour de force" &lt;ref name="wittkower"/&gt; "depicting convincingly something as evanescent as flames, or as dependent on colour as glowing coals."&lt;ref name="avery"&gt;{{cite book|last=Avery |first=Charles |title=Bernini: Genius of the Baroque |publisher=Bulfinch |location= |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-8212-2465-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniele Pinton talks of the "skilful rendition of the flames under the gridiron, where the portrayal of an immaterial element such as fire is magnificently rendered in stone." &lt;ref name="pinton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinton |first=Daniele |title=Bernini: I percorsi nell'arte |publisher=ATS Italia |location= |year=2009 |isbn=978-88-7571-777-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Avery goes as far to see the technical innovation of the work as its raison-d’être. He cites the piece’s naturalism, its emotional intensity, his use of subject previously never previously depicted as a full three-dimensional sculpture and concludes that “the work is a manifesto of his ability on the threshold of his adult career, much like the ‘master piece’ with which a craftsman matriculates into his guild.” &lt;ref name="avery"/&gt;

==Recent history==
At the start of the 1800s, the sculpture was moved to another Strozzi-owned palace in Rome, and then around 1830 it was moved to the [[Palazzo Strozzi]] in Florence. In 1935, it then became part of the [[Alessandro Contini-Bonacossi|Contini-Bonacossi]] collection, before being acquired by the Italian state in 1969. It was shown in the Palazzo Pitti from 1974, and then in the Uffizi from December 1998.&lt;ref name="coliva"/&gt;

'''Millbank''' is an area of [[central London]] in the [[City of Westminster]]. Millbank is located by the [[River Thames]], east of [[Pimlico]] and south of [[Westminster]]. Millbank is known as the location of major government offices, [[Burberry]] headquarters, the [[Millbank Tower]] and prominent art institutions such as [[Tate Britain]] and the [[Chelsea College of Art and Design]].   

==History==
[[Image:Tate.britain.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tate Britain]] (Millbank)]]
The area derives its name from a [[watermill]] owned by [[Westminster Abbey]] that once stood at a site close to present day [[College Green (London)|College Green]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Griffiths|first1=Arthur|title=Memorials of Millbank, and Chapters in Prison History, Volume 1|date=1875|publisher=Henry S. King &amp; Co.|location=London|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Norden|Norden's survey]], taken during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1573, records the existence of such a mill although much of the area that comprises Millbank today, was referred to by [[Samuel Pepys]] and others as Tothill Fields. Described as a place of [[Plague pit|plague pits]] and a "low, marshy locality" suitable for shooting snipe in the nearby "bogs and quagmires".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

After Cromwell's victory at the [[Battle of Worcester]] in September 1651, some 4,000 defeated Royalists were imprisoned at Tothill Fields prior to being sold as slaves to merchants trading with Africa and the West Indies. Facilities at the prison camp on the marshy ground were so poor that 1,200 prisoners were recorded as having died in the primitive conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shepherd|first1=Robert|title=Westminster: A Biography: From the Earliest Times to the Present|date=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=978-1-4411-2386-2|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the development of [[Millbank Prison]] in 1816, the area was sparsely covered with residential houses, but did feature a distillery by the river owned by a Mr. Hodge and numerous small [[Almshouse|almshouses]], [[Tothill Fields Bridewell|bridewells]] and pest houses for the poor, criminally inclined and sick.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Baltic Wharf, a site just to the north of [[Vauxhall Bridge]], was for much of the 19th century the location of a Henry Castle &amp; Son, a [[ship breaking]] and timber merchant. Numerous wooden [[ship of the line|ships of the line]] of the [[Royal Navy]] were dismantled at this location, their ornate figureheads often displayed on the gates and perimeter of the yard walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Girling|first1=Brian|title=Pimlico through Time|date=2013|publisher=Amberley Publishing|location=Stroud|isbn=9781445630304}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Millbank's general appearance today dates from the 1930s, when the area was extensively rebuilt to repair damage caused by the [[1928 Thames flood]] disaster, following the collapse of a 25-metre-long section of the [[Thames Embankment]]. Millbank shares the name of the main road ([[A3212 road|A3212]]) along the north bank of the [[River Thames]], extending northwards from [[Vauxhall Bridge]] to Abingdon Street, just south from [[Parliament Square]]. There are parliamentary offices situated across this road, notably No.7, built as the headquarters of [[British American Tobacco]]. The road was created as part of the Thames Embankment in the mid 19th century and lies above a large interceptor sewer. 

The former [[Royal Army Medical College]], situated at Millbank, is the site where the vaccine for [[typhoid]] was first developed, and in the late 19th century, was where the world's first modern prison ([[Millbank Prison]]) was established. The [[Listed building|listed]] site has since been renovated as a purpose built arts college for the [[Chelsea College of Art and Design]] in 2005. The [[Tate Britain]] art gallery (former [[Tate Gallery]]) is directly opposite near the end of [[Vauxhall Bridge]], providing a distinct arts presence in the area.

The headquarters of the British chemicals giant [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] was originally located at Imperial Chemical House on Millbank (The Smith Square entrance of which was called Nobel House) before it relocated to [[Manchester Square]], also situated in London. The headquarters for the [[Northern Ireland Office]], [[MI5]] and [[Thames House]] are also nearby.

On 18 December 1973, the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) exploded a bomb on Thorney Street at 8:50am. The bomb resulted in over 50 people injured, including two seriously (see [[1973 Westminster bombing]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1973/dec/18/bomb-incidents-london|title=BOMB INCIDENTS (LONDON) (Hansard, 18 December 1973)|author=|date=|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Millbank Studios reside in the area as an independent broadcast company, owned by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. The studio is situated opposite the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]]. The [[BBC Parliament]] broadcasting channel is also situated nearby (intended to broadcast parliamentary and general political coverage on behalf of the [[BBC]]). No.4 is the location commonly used by broadcasters for producing coverage of the [[Westminster]] area, including the [[BBC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfc.org.uk/node/72 |title=Guide to Media Contacts and Addresses |work=Press for Change |accessdate=11 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413095745/http://www.pfc.org.uk/node/72 |archivedate=13 April 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sky News]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnewsroom.co.uk/sky-news/sky-news-images-day-at-millbank/|title=Day at Millbank|work=TV Newsroom|accessdate=11 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016115055/http://tvnewsroom.co.uk/sky-news/sky-news-images-day-at-millbank/|archivedate=16 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skypressoffice.co.uk/SkyNews/Resources/showarticle.asp?id=2668 |title=Sky News Radio Sole National News Supplier to UK Commercial Stations |work=Sky News Press Office |accessdate=11 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928052508/http://www.skypressoffice.co.uk/SkyNews/Resources/showarticle.asp?id=2668 |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ITV.

==Notable buildings==
[[File:Millbank Tower, Thames House, Parliament.JPG|thumb|left|[[Millbank Tower]] from Vauxhall, with [[Thames House]] and the [[Palace of Westminster]] visible in the background.]]
Millbank Estate is a large but highly regarded [[Listed building#England and Wales|Grade II-listed]] red-brick housing estate that gives the area behind Tate Britain a distinct character. The estate was built between 1897 and 1902, the bricks being recycled from [[Millbank Prison]], which had closed in 1890. The 17 buildings, comprising one of London's earliest social housing schemes, are named after distinguished painters such as Turner, Gainsborough, Millais, etc. The estate has 562 flats, all managed on behalf of Westminster City Council by MEMO, the largest [[tenant management organisation]] in Westminster. The estate's management board is elected annually from the resident population. Half of the estate's flats are private leaseholds, the other half are rented from Westminster City Council. The estate's buildings are maintained by a regular works program. 

In 1914-16 architects [[John William Simpson|John W. Simpson]] and [[Maxwell Ayrton]] designed and built 4 Millbank, a six-story Neoclassical office building for the Offices of the Crown Agents for the Colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spaces of Global Cultures: Architecture, Urbanism, Identity|last=King|first=Anthony|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=9781134644452|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This structure has since been converted into multi-let office building with a central, glass-roofed atrium.  

Hide Tower is a 20-storey building of 162 flats with an extensive garden, a mini-golf facility and a community hall. Approximately a quarter of the accommodation is privately rented; half is rented from Westminster City Council and the remainder is owner-occupied. The name was derived from the "[[Hide (unit)|hide]]", an old English land measure (used in the [[Domesday Survey]] of 1086).

[[Millbank Tower]] is a large, modernistic office complex between the River Thames, Millbank Estate and Tate Britain Gallery.  It has several restaurants and a public garden. Before the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 General Election]], the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] acquired two floors of the building as its headquarters. The £1 million annual rent, however, forced the party to vacate the tower in 2001 for 16 Old Queen Street, Westminster. In British politics, the term "Millbank Machine" or "Millbank tendency" (a play on "[[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant tendency]]") has been linked with the activities of [[Spin (public relations)|spin doctors]]. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] also formerly had its headquarters, [[Conservative Campaign Headquarters|CCHQ]] based in the tower.

==Public transport==
[[Millbank Millennium Pier]] is a modern River Thames pier structure. A regular service by a [[Damien Hirst]]-designed riverboat connects Tate Britain with [[Tate Modern]].

The nearest [[List of London Underground stations|London Underground stations]] are [[Westminster tube station|Westminster]], [[Pimlico tube station|Pimlico]] and [[Victoria tube station|Victoria]]. [[London Victoria station]] is also a [[National Rail]] mainline terminus with an [[Victoria Coach Station|adjacent national coach station]]. [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo]] and [[Charing Cross railway station|Charing Cross]] stations are also nearby. Millbank is well connected with the rest of Central London and districts south of the river by bus services such as [[London Buses route 87|number 87]], [[London Buses route 88|88]], [[London Buses route C10|C10]], [[London Buses route 507|507]], [[London Buses route 2|2]], [[London Buses route 36|36]], [[London Buses route 365|365]] and [[London Buses route 185|185]].

The '''Mont des Arts''' ([[French language|French]], {{IPA-fr|mɔ̃dɛzaʁ|pron}}) or '''Kunstberg''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]], {{IPA-nl|ˈkɵnzdbɛrx|pron|Nl-Kunstberg.ogg}}), meaning "hill/mount of the arts", is an urban complex and historic site in the centre of [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], including the [[Royal Library of Belgium]], the [[National Archives of Belgium]], the [[Square – Brussels Meeting Centre]], and a public garden.

This site is located between rue Montagne de la Cour/Hofbergstraat and the [[Coudenberg|Coundenberg]] in its 'upper' part, and Boulevard de l'Empereur/Keizerslaan and Place de l'Albertine/Albertinaplein in its 'lower' part. It is served by the [[Brussels Central Station]].

== History ==
The area of the Mont des Arts used to be a densely populated neighbourhood, the ''Quartier Saint Roches/Sint-Rochuswijk''. Between the 15th and the 18th century, the hill on which it was located was known as the ''Montagne de la Cour/Hofberg''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.montdesarts.com/en/History|title=Kunstberg - History|website=www.montdesarts.com|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th century, [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]] had the idea to convert the site into an arts' quarter and bought the whole neighbourhood. Various architects and urban planners were called upon to draw plans of the buildings which were to accommodate all kinds of cultural institutions. After the demolition of the old buildings, the site turned into an ugly urban void because the project lacked sufficient finance. To increase the area's appeal during the [[Brussels International 1910|Brussels International Exposition of 1910]], the king ordered the French landscape architect Pierre Vacherot to design a 'temporary' garden on the hill. It featured a park and a monumental staircase with cascading fountains descending the gentle slope from [[Place Royale (Brussels)|Place Royale]] down to Boulevard de l'Empereur/Keizerslaan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1910, a year after the death of Leopold II, the new park was inaugurated by [[Albert I of Belgium|King Albert I]].

[[File:Belgique - Bruxelles - Palais des Congrès - 01.jpg|thumb|[[Square – Brussels Meeting Centre|Congress Palace of Brussels]]]]
Although the garden was conceived as temporary, it became a well-appreciated green area in the heart of the capital, but when the plans for the Mont des Arts came back by the end of the 1930s, this park had to be demolished to create a new square as the centre of the urban renewal project. The project was entrusted jointly to architects Maurice Houyoux and Jules Ghobert. Between 1956 and 1958, the park and its surroundings gave way to massive, severe geometric structures such as the [[Royal Library of Belgium|Royal Royal Library of Belgium]] and the Congress Palace. The new geometric garden on the square was designed by landscape architect René Péchère.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The inauguration took place in 1969.

== Present day ==
The Mont des Arts offers one of Brussels' finest views. From the elevated vantage point, the famous tower of the [[Brussels Town Hall]] in the [[Grand Place]] is clearly visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://visit.brussels/en/place/Mont-des-Arts-Gardens|title=Mont des Arts Gardens|website=visit.brussels|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a sunny day, the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Belgium|Koekelberg Basilica]] and even the [[Atomium]] can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theculturetrip.com/europe/belgium/articles/the-history-of-the-mont-des-arts-in-1-minute/|title=The History Of The Mont des Arts In 1 Minute|last=Poel|first=Nana Van De|work=Culture Trip|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monumento al Divino Salvador del Mundo''' ({{lang-en|Monument to the Divine Savior of the World}}) is a [[monument]] located on Plaza El Salvador del Mundo (The Savior of the World Plaza) in [[San Salvador|San Salvador City]], [[El Salvador]]. It consists of a statue of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] standing on top of a global sphere of planet earth, placed on top of the tall four-sided concrete base pedestal.&lt;ref name="O'Malley2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charlie O'Malley|title=Frommer's Nicaragua and El Salvador|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2__jaeRMFIwC&amp;pg=PA256|date=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-16027-5|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a landmark located in the country's capital San Salvador. It is a symbol that identifies and represents both El Salvador and Salvadorans throughout the world.

==History==
The monument was built on a pedestal originally used to decorate the tomb of [[Manuel Enrique Araujo]], the [[President of El Salvador]] between 1911 and 1913.,&lt;ref name="historia" /&gt; and presented by Araujo's family on November 26, 1942, in connection to the first National [[Eucharist]]ic Congress in San Salvador.&lt;ref name="historia"&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.amss.gob.sv/pages/ciudad/historia.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080113190637/http://www.amss.gob.sv/pages/ciudad/historia.htm | archivedate = 13 January 2008 | title = Historia "Ciudad de San Salvador" | language = Spanish | accessdate = 2 May 2010 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The iconic statue of Christ on the globe sphere of planet earth is part of the Monument to Divino Salvador del Mundo on Plaza El Salvador del Mundo (The Savior of the World Plaza).

The statue was damaged in the [[1986 San Salvador earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inicia restauración imagen del Salvador del Mundo |url=http://elmundo.com.sv/inicia-restauracion-imagen-del-salvador-del-mundo |newspaper=[[Diario El Mundo]] |date=2 October 2010 |accessdate=19 April 2013|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Piden pintar monumento al Divino Salvador del Mundo |author=Jamie García |url=http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_completa.asp?idCat=47868&amp;idArt=7469398 |newspaper=elsalvador.com |date=1 November 2012 |accessdate=19 April 2013|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was rebuilt and put back in place months after the campaign "Lift up your soul Salvadoran". In front of the plaza, there is a statue lifted in memory of [[Oscar Arnulfo Romero]]. On the other side, from that area, it is customary to begin the march of floats during the celebration of the festivities of the city.

==Remodelling==
The plaza was completely remodeled and entirely upgraded in 2010. As part of the reorganization plan to improve the image of San Salvador, mayor [[Norman Quijano]] made the remodeling and renaming of Plaza las Americas, now named Plaza Salvador del Mundo. The renovation work included the complete renovation of sidewalks, the stands and the area of the flags. The image of Christ, placed about 18 m high,  was also revamped with new paint.

'''''Mulaney''''' is an American [[sitcom]] that aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] from October 5, 2014 to February 15, 2015. Stand-up comedian and former ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' writer [[John Mulaney]] created the show and starred as a fictionalized version of himself. At the beginning of each episode, and sometimes throughout, Mulaney would perform [[stand-up comedy]] to the studio audience. The show suffered from low ratings and poor critical reviews, and was cancelled in March 2015.&lt;ref name=DeadlineCanceled&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andreeva|first1=Nellie|title=Dana Walden Talks ‘New Girl’ &amp; ‘The Mindy Project’ Future, Fox’s Scheduling Needs|url=http://deadline.com/2015/01/new-girl-mindy-project-future-scheduling-fox-dana-walden-1201352538/|website=Deadline|accessdate=April 11, 2015|date=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series premiered October 5, 2014.

On October 18, 2014, the day before the third episode was supposed to air, Fox announced it was cutting three episodes from its order.

==Reception==
{{quote box|quote=I look back on making the show really fondly. It's my noble failure. I tried, and I wanted to do it this way. Some people liked it—just not enough.|align=right|width=300px|source=John Mulaney, ''New Times''&lt;ref&gt;Pfeffer, Ryan (May 1, 2015). [http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/arts/with-no-more-distractions-john-mulaney-returns-to-stand-up-6945958 "WITH NO MORE DISTRACTIONS, JOHN MULANEY RETURNS TO STAND UP"]. ''New Times''. Retrieved June 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Even before ''Mulaney'' aired, critics were wary of the direction of the show.  After viewing the show's trailer, Eric Dodds with ''TIME'' magazine penned an article called, "8 Ways the Trailer for ''Mulaney'' Resembles ''Seinfeld''," and said it could "trigger a little déjà vu."&lt;ref name=dodds/&gt;  In regard to its [[multi-camera]] format, Canadian magazine ''Maclean's'' asked, "why would a cool comic pick such an uncool format?"&lt;ref name=seinfeld&gt;Weinman, Jaime J. (August 4, 2014), "'The New Seinfeld'".  ''Maclean's''. '''127''' (30/31):60-62&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the show was universally panned by critics, with most reviews drawing unflattering comparisons to ''Seinfeld''. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the show has an approval rating of 17% based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 4.3/10. The site's critical consensus states, "John Mulaney, we know [[Jerry Seinfeld]]. ''Seinfeld'' was funny. ''Mulaney'', you're no ''Seinfeld''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/mulaney/s01|title=Mulaney: Season 1|date=October 5, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the series has a weighted average score of 38 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/mulaney|title=Mulaney|work=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Poniewozik]] with ''TIME'' magazine said the show "seems like something a dutiful student might have produced for his final project in his 'Tropes and Themes in the 1990s Sitcom' class."&lt;ref&gt;Poniewozik, James (October 3, 2014), "Review: Mulaney Does Its Homework Too Well." ''TIME''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Robert Bianco with ''[[USA Today]]'' called the sitcom a "misfire."&lt;ref&gt;Bianco, Robert (October 3, 2014), "Fox's ‘Mulaney' is a misfire of a sitcom". ''USA Today''.&lt;/ref&gt; The show was named the fourth-worst show of 2014 by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20326356_20879083,00.html#30260950|title=5 Worst TV Shows of 2014|work=EW.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mulaney'' fared poorly commercially as well, with the series premiere only getting 2.3 million viewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/10/07/sunday-final-ratings-once-upon-a-time-resurrection-madam-secretary-adjusted-down/311599/|title=Sunday Final Ratings: ‘Once Upon a Time’, ‘Resurrection’ &amp; ‘Revenge’ Adjusted Up; ‘Madam Secretary’ Adjusted Down|work=TVbytheNumbers|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the  weakest scores for any of the fall's series premieres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/data/ratings/foxs-mulaney-off-to-weak-start-sunday-once-strong-madam-secretary-rises-1201322395/|title=‘Mulaney’ Ratings Weak in Premiere; ‘Once Upon a Time’ Ratings Strong|work=Variety|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The episode from December 21, 2014, became the lowest rated episode, with fewer than 1 million views; the January 18, 2015 episode, airing after the [[2014–15 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship Game: Seattle Seahawks 28, Green Bay Packers 22 (OT)|NFC Championship Game]], became the highest-rated, with over 3 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/mulaney-season-one-ratings-34246/|title=Mulaney TV show on FOX: latest ratings (cancel or renew?)|publisher=TV Series Finale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word derives from the Latin verb ''narrare'', "to tell", which is derived from the adjective ''gnarus'', "knowing" or "skilled".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Traupman|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Webster|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrative can be organized in a number of thematic or formal categories: [[non-fiction]] (such as definitively including [[creative non-fiction]], [[biography]], [[journalism]], [[transcript poetry]], and [[historiography]]); fictionalization of historical events (such as [[anecdote]], [[myth]], [[legend]], and [[historical fiction]]); and [[fiction]] proper (such as [[literature]] in [[prose]] and sometimes [[poetry]], such as [[short story|short stories]], [[novel]]s, and [[narrative poetry|narrative poems and song]]s, and imaginary narratives as portrayed in other textual forms, games, or live or recorded performances).

Narrative is found in all forms of human creativity, art, and entertainment, including [[public speaking|speech]], [[literature]], [[theatre]], [[music]] and [[song]], [[comics]], [[journalism]], [[film]], [[television]] and [[video]], [[video game]]s, [[radio program|radio]], [[game]]play, [[play (activity)|unstructured recreation]], and [[performance]] in general, as well as some [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[drawing]], [[photography]], and other [[visual arts]], as long as a [[sequence (disambiguation)|sequence]] of events is presented. Several art movements, such as [[modern art]], refuse the narrative in favor of the [[abstract art|abstract]] and conceptual.

[[Oral storytelling]] is the earliest method for sharing narratives.&lt;ref&gt;International Journal of Education and the Arts | [https://web.archive.org/web/20080630042438/http://www.ijea.org/v2n1/ The Power of Storytelling: How Oral Narrative Influences Children's Relationships in Classrooms]&lt;/ref&gt; During most people's childhoods, narratives are used to guide them on proper behavior, cultural history, formation of a communal identity, and values, as especially studied in [[anthropology]] today among traditional [[indigenous people]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, ''et al.'' 2002. Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian events within any given narrative&lt;/ref&gt;

Narratives may also be nested within other narratives, such as narratives told by an [[unreliable narrator]] (a [[character (arts)|character]]) typically found in [[noir fiction]] genre. An important part of [[narration]] is the [[narrative mode]], the set of methods used to communicate the narrative through a process narration (see also "Narrative Aesthetics" below).

Along with [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], [[argumentation]], and [[description]], narration, broadly defined, is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse. More narrowly defined, it is the [[fiction-writing mode]] in which the [[narrator]] communicates directly to the reader.

== Overview ==
A narrative is a telling of some true or fictitious event or connected sequence of events, recounted by a narrator to a narratee (although there may be more than one of each).  Narratives are to be distinguished from descriptions of qualities, states, or situations, and also from dramatic enactments of events (although a dramatic work may also include narrative speeches).  A narrative consists of a set of events (the story) recounted in a process of narration (or [[discourse]]), in which the events are selected and arranged in a particular order (the plot).  The category of narratives includes both the shortest accounts of events (for example, ''the cat sat on the mat'', or a brief news item) and the longest historical or biographical works, diaries, travelogues, and so forth, as well as novels, ballads, epics, short stories, and other fictional forms.  In the study of fiction, it is usual to divide novels and shorter stories into first-person narratives and third-person narratives.  As an adjective, "narrative" means "characterized by or relating to storytelling":  thus '''narrative technique''' is the method of telling stories, and '''narrative poetry''' is the class of poems (including ballads, epics, and verse romances) that tell stories, as distinct from dramatic and lyric poetry.  Some theorists of narratology have attempted to isolate the quality or set of properties that distinguishes narrative from non-narrative writings:  this is called '''narrativity'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human nature==
[[Owen Flanagan]] of Duke University, a leading consciousness researcher, writes, "Evidence strongly suggests that humans in all cultures come to cast their own identity in some sort of narrative form. We are inveterate storytellers."&lt;ref&gt;Owen Flanagan ''Consciousness Reconsidered'' 198&lt;/ref&gt; Stories are an important aspect of culture. Many works of art and most works of literature tell stories; indeed, most of the [[humanities]] involve stories.&lt;ref&gt;Humanities tell our stories | https://asunow.asu.edu/content/humanities-tell-our-stories-what-it-means-be-human&lt;/ref&gt;
Stories are of ancient origin, existing in [[ancient Egypt]]ian, [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]], [[Ancient China|Chinese]] and [[History of India|Indian]] cultures and their [[myths]]. Stories are also a ubiquitous component of human communication, used as [[parables]] and examples to illustrate points. [[Storytelling]] was probably one of the earliest forms of entertainment. As noted by Owen Flanagan, narrative may also refer to psychological processes in self-identity, memory and [[meaning-making]].

[[Semiotics]] begins with the individual building blocks of [[meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] called [[sign (semiotics)|signs]]; and [[semantics]], the way in which signs are combined into [[code (semiotics)|codes]] to transmit messages. This is part of a general [[communication]] system using both verbal and non-verbal elements, and creating a discourse with different
[[modality (semiotics)|modalities]] and forms.

In ''On Realism in Art'' [[Roman Jakobson]] argues that literature exists as a separate entity. He and many other semioticians prefer the view that all texts, whether spoken or written, are the same, except that some authors [[encode (semiotics)|encode]] their texts with distinctive ''literary'' qualities that distinguish them from other forms of discourse. Nevertheless, there is a clear trend to address literary narrative forms as separable from other forms. This is first seen in [[Russian Formalism]] through [[Victor Shklovsky]]'s analysis of the relationship between composition and style, and in the work of [[Vladimir Propp]], who analysed the [[plot (narrative)|plots]] used in traditional folk-tales and identified 31 distinct functional components.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Propp, ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p 25, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend (or these trends) continued in the work of the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague School]] and of French scholars such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Roland Barthes]]. It leads to a structural analysis of narrative and an increasingly influential body of modern work that raises important theoretical questions:
* What is ''text?''
* What is its role ([[culture]])?
* How is it manifested as art, cinema, theater, or literature?
* Why is narrative divided into different [[genre]]s, such as poetry, [[Wikipedian in Residence|short stories]], and novels?

== Literary theory ==
In literary theoretic approach, narrative is being narrowly defined as [[fiction-writing mode]] in which the narrator is communicating directly to the reader. Until the late 19th century, [[literary criticism]] as an academic exercise dealt solely with [[poetry]] (including [[epic poem]]s like the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Paradise Lost]],'' and poetic drama like [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]). Most [[poem]]s did not have a narrator distinct from the author.

But [[novel]]s, lending a number of voices to several characters in addition to narrator's, created a possibility of narrator's views differing significantly from the author's views. With the rise of the novel in the [[18th century in literature|18th century]], the concept of the narrator (as opposed to "author") made the question of narrator a prominent one for literary theory. It has been proposed that perspective and interpretive knowledge are the essential characteristics, while focalization and structure are lateral characteristics of the narrator.{{According to whom|date=September 2013}}

The role of literary theory in narrative has been disputed; with some interpretations like [[Tzvetan Todorov|Todorov's]] narrative model that views all narratives in a cyclical manner, and that each narrative is characterized by a three part structure that allows the narrative to progress. The beginning stage being an establishment of equilibrium--a state of non conflict, followed by a disruption to this state, caused by an external event, and lastly a restoration or a return to equilibrium--a conclusion that brings the narrative back to a similar space before the events of the narrative unfolded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Todorov|first=Tzvetan|last2=Weinstein|first2=Arnold|date=1969|title=Structural Analysis of Narrative|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1345003|journal=NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction|volume=3|issue=1|pages=70–76|doi=10.2307/1345003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critiques of literary theory in narrative challenge the very role of literariness in narrative, as well as the role of narrative in literature. Meaning, narratives and their associated aesthetics, emotions, and values have the ability to operate without the presence of literature and vice versa. According to Didier Costa, the structural model used by Todorov and others is unfairly biased towards a Western interpretation of narrative, and that a more comprehensive and transformative model must be created in order to properly analyze narrative discourse in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coste|first=Didier|date=2017-06-28|title=Narrative Theory and Aesthetics in Literature|url=http://oxfordre.com/literature/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.001.0001/acrefore-9780190201098-e-116|journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Literature|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.013.116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Framing also plays a pivotal role in narrative structure; an analysis of the historical and cultural contexts present during the development of a narrative is needed in order to more accurately represent the role of narratology in societies that relied heavily on oral narratives.

==Types of narrators and their modes==
A writer's choice in the narrator is crucial for the way a work of fiction is perceived by the reader. There is a distinction between [[first-person narrative|first-person]] and [[third-person narrative]], which [[Gérard Genette]] refers to as intradiegetic and extradiegetic narrative, respectively. Intradiagetic narrators are of two types: a homodiegetic narrator participates as a character in the story. Such a narrator cannot know more about other characters than what their actions reveal. A heterodiegetic narrator, in contrast, describes the experiences of the characters that appear in the story in which he or she does not participate.

Most narrators present their story from one of the following perspectives (called [[narrative mode]]s): first-person, or third-person limited or omniscient. Generally, a [[First-person narrative|first-person narrator]] brings greater focus on the feelings, opinions, and perceptions of a particular character in a story, and on how the character views the world and the views of other characters. If the writer's intention is to get inside the world of a character, then it is a good choice, although a [[Third person limited|third-person limited narrator]] is an alternative that does not require the writer to reveal all that a first-person character would know. By contrast, a [[Third-person omniscient narrative|third-person omniscient narrator]] gives a panoramic view of the world of the story, looking into many characters and into the broader background of a story. A third-person omniscient narrator can be an animal or an object, or it can be a more abstract instance that does not refer to itself. For stories in which the context and the views of many characters are important, a third-person narrator is a better choice. However, a third-person narrator does not need to be an omnipresent guide, but instead may merely be the protagonist referring to himself in the third person (also known as third person limited narrator).

=== Multiple narrators ===
{{Main|Multiperspectivity}}
A writer may choose to let several narrators tell the story from different points of view. Then it is up to the reader to decide which narrator seems most reliable for each part of the story. It may refer to the style of the writer in which he/she expresses the paragraph written. See for instance the works of [[Louise Erdrich]]. [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'' is a prime example of the use of multiple narrators. Faulkner employs [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] to narrate the story from various perspectives.

In Indigenous American communities, narratives and storytelling are often told by a number of elders in the community. In this way, the stories are never static because they are shaped by the relationship between narrator and audience. Thus, each individual story may have countless variations. Narrators often incorporate minor changes in the story in order to tailor the story to different audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Piquemal, 2003. From Native North American Oral Traditions to Western Literacy: Storytelling in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of multiple narratives in a story is not simply a stylistic choice, but rather an interpretive one that offers insight into the development of a larger social identity and the impact that has on the overarching narrative, as explained by Lee Haring.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haring|first=Lee|date=2004-08-27|title=Framing in Oral Narrative|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/172275|journal=Marvels &amp; Tales|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=229–245|doi=10.1353/mat.2004.0035|issn=1536-1802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haring analyzes the use of framing in oral narratives, and how the usage of multiple perspectives provides the audience with a greater historical and cultural background of the narrative. She also argues that narratives (particularly myths and folktales) that implement multiple narrators deserves to be categorized as its own narrative genre, rather than simply a narrative device that is used solely to explain phenomena from different points of view.

Haring provides an example from the Arabic folktales of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|A Thousand and One Nights]]'' to illustrate how framing was used to loosely connect each story to the next, where each story was enclosed within the larger narrative. Additionally, Haring draws comparisons between ''Thousand and One Nights'' and the oral storytelling observed in parts of rural [[Ireland]], islands of the Southwest Indian Ocean, and African cultures such as [[Madagascar|Madagascar.]]&lt;blockquote&gt;"I'll tell you what I'll do," said the smith. "I'll fix your sword for you tomorrow, if you tell me a story while I'm doing it." The speaker was an Irish storyteller in 1935, framing one story in another (O'Sullivan 75, 264). The moment recalls the Thousand and One Nights , where the story of "The Envier and the Envied" is enclosed in the larger story told by the Second Kalandar (Burton 1 : 113-39), and many stories are enclosed in others."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Aesthetics approach==
Narrative is a highly aesthetic art. Thoughtfully composed stories have a number of aesthetic elements. Such elements include the idea of [[narrative structure]], with identifiable beginnings, middles and ends, or exposition-development-climax-denouement, with coherent plot lines; a strong focus on temporality including retention of the past, attention to present action and protention/future anticipation; a substantial focus on character and characterization, "arguably the most important single component of the novel" ([[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]] ''The Art of Fiction'' 67); different voices interacting, "the sound of the human voice, or many voices, speaking in a variety of accents, rhythms and registers" (Lodge ''The Art of Fiction'' 97; see also the theory of [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] for expansion of this idea); a narrator or narrator-like voice, which "addresses" and "interacts with" reading audiences (see [[Reader Response]] theory); communicates with a [[Wayne Booth]]-esque rhetorical thrust, a dialectic process of interpretation, which is at times beneath the surface, forming a plotted narrative, and at other times much more visible, "arguing" for and against various positions; relies substantially on the use of literary tropes (see [[Hayden White]], ''Metahistory'' for expansion of this idea); is often intertextual with other literatures; and commonly demonstrates an effort toward ''[[bildungsroman]]'', a description of identity development with an effort to evince ''becoming'' in character and community. {{technical statement|date=January 2013}}

== Psychological approach ==
{{see also|Narrative therapy}}
Within [[philosophy of mind]], the [[social sciences]] and various clinical fields including medicine, narrative can refer to aspects of human psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Hevern, V. W. (2004, March). [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~hevern/narpsych/nrintro.html Introduction and general overview. Narrative psychology: Internet and resource guide]. [[Le Moyne College]]. Retrieved September 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A personal narrative process is involved in a person's sense of [[Personal identity|personal]] or [[cultural identity]], and in the creation and construction of [[memories]]; it is thought by some to be the fundamental nature of the [[self]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, Daniel C (1992) [http://cogprints.org/266/ The Self as a Center of Narrative Gravity.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dan McAdams |title=Redemptive Self: Narrative Identity in America Today |journal=The Self and Memory |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=95–116 |year=2004 |doi= 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195176933.001.0001|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a729208757~db=all~jumptype=rss|isbn=9780195176933 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The breakdown of a coherent or positive narrative has been implicated in the development of [[psychosis]] and [[mental disorder]], and its repair said to play an important role in journeys of [[recovery model|recovery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gold E |title=From narrative wreckage to islands of clarity: Stories of recovery from psychosis |journal=Can Fam Physician |volume=53 |issue=8 |pages=1271–5 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17872833 |pmc=1949240 }} Hyden, L.-C. &amp; Brockmeier, J. (2009). Health, Illness and Culture: Broken Narratives. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Narrative Therapy]] is a school of (family) [[psychotherapy]].

[[Illness narrative]]s are a way for a person affected by an illness to make sense of his or her experiences.&lt;ref name=Sulik&gt;{{cite book
|author=Gayle A. Sulik

In the [[restitution]] narrative, the person sees the illness as a temporary detour. The primary goal is to return permanently to normal life and normal health. These may also be called '''cure narratives'''. In the [[chaos narrative]], the person sees the illness as a permanent state that will inexorably get worse, with no redeeming virtues. This is typical of diseases like [[Alzheimer's disease]]: the patient gets worse and worse, and there is no hope of returning to normal life. The third major type, the [[quest narrative]], positions the illness experience as an opportunity to transform oneself into a better person through overcoming adversity and re-learning what is most important in life; the physical outcome of the illness is less important than the spiritual and psychological transformation. This is typical of the triumphant view of [[cancer survivorship]] in the [[breast cancer culture]].&lt;ref name=Sulik /&gt;

Personality traits, more specifically the [[Big Five personality traits]], appear to be associated with the type of language or patterns of word use found in an individual's self-narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsh, J. B., &amp; Peterson, J. B. (2009). Personality and language use in self-narratives. Journal of Research in Personality, 43, 524-527.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, language use in self-narratives accurately reflects human personality. The linguistic correlates of each Big Five trait are as follows:

* [[Extraversion]] - positively correlated with words referring to humans, social processes and family;
* [[Agreeableness]] - positively correlated with family, inclusiveness and certainty; negatively correlated with anger and body (i.e., few negative comments about health/body);
* [[Conscientiousness]] - positively correlated with achievement and work; negatively related to body, death, anger and exclusiveness;
* [[Neuroticism]] - positively correlated with sadness, negative emotion, body, anger, home and anxiety; negatively correlated with work;
* [[Openness]] - positively correlated with perceptual processes, hearing and exclusiveness

== Social sciences approaches==
Human beings often claim to understand events when they manage to formulate a coherent story or narrative explaining how they believe the event was generated. Narratives thus lie at foundations of our cognitive procedures and also provide an explanatory framework for the social sciences, particularly when it is difficult to assemble enough cases to permit statistical analysis. Narrative is often used in [[case study research]] in the social sciences. Here it has been found that the dense, contextual, and interpenetrating nature of social forces uncovered by detailed narratives is often more interesting and useful for both social theory and social policy than other forms of social inquiry.

Sociologists Jaber F. Gubrium and James A. Holstein have contributed to the formation of a constructionist approach to narrative in sociology. From their book The Self We Live By: Narrative Identity in a Postmodern World (2000), to more recent texts such as Analyzing Narrative Reality (2009)and Varieties of Narrative Analysis (2012), they have developed an analytic framework for researching stories and storytelling that is centered on the interplay of institutional discourses (big stories) on the one hand, and everyday accounts (little stories) on the other. The goal is the sociological understanding of formal and lived texts of experience, featuring the production, practices, and communication of accounts.

=== Inquiry approach===
In order to avoid "hardened stories," or "narratives that become context-free, portable and ready to be used anywhere and anytime for illustrative purposes" and are being used as [[conceptual metaphor]]s as defined by linguist [[George Lakoff]], an approach called [[narrative inquiry]] was proposed, resting on the epistemological assumption that human beings make sense of [[random]] or complex multicausal experience by the imposition of story structures."&lt;ref name="conlea"&gt;Conle, C. (2000). Narrative inquiry: Research tool and medium for professional development. European Journal of Teacher Education, 23(1), 49–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bell"&gt;Bell, J.S. (2002). Narrative Inquiry: More Than Just Telling Stories. TESOL Quarterly, 36(2), 207–213.&lt;/ref&gt; Human propensity to simplify data through a predilection for narratives over complex [[data]] sets typically leads to [[narrative fallacy]]. It is easier for the human mind to remember and make decisions on the basis of stories with meaning, than to remember strings of data. This is one reason why narratives are so powerful and why many of the classics in the humanities and social sciences are written in the narrative format. But humans read meaning into data and compose stories, even where this is unwarranted. In narrative inquiry, the way to avoid the narrative fallacy is no different from the way to avoid other error in scholarly research, i.e., by applying the usual methodical checks for [[Validity (logic)|validity]] and reliability in how data are collected, analyzed, and presented.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Several criteria for assessing the validity of narrative research was proposed, including the objective aspect, the emotional aspect, the social/moral aspect, and the clarity of the story.

===Mathematical sociology approach ===
In mathematical sociology, the theory of comparative narratives was devised in order to describe and compare the structures (expressed as "and" in a [[directed graph]] where multiple causal links incident into a node are conjoined) of action-driven sequential events.&lt;ref name="abell1987"&gt;Abell. P. (1987) The Syntax of Social Life: the theory and Method of Comparative Narratives, Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abell1993"&gt;Abell, P. (1993) Some Aspects of Narrative Method, Journal of Mathematical Sociology, 18. 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abell2009"&gt;Abell, P. (2009) A Case for Cases, Comparative Narratives in Sociological Explanation, Sociological Methods and Research, 32, 1-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narratives so conceived comprise the following ingredients:
* A finite set of state descriptions of the world S, the components of which are weakly ordered in time;
* A finite set of actors/agents (individual or collective), P;
* A finite set of actions A;
* A mapping of P onto A;

The structure ([[directed graph]]) is generated by letting the nodes stand for the states and the directed edges represent how the states are changed by specified actions. The action skeleton can then be abstracted, comprising a further digraph where the actions are depicted as nodes and edges take the form "action '''a''' co-determined (in context of other actions) action '''b'''".

Narratives can be both abstracted and generalised by imposing an [[Abstract algebra|algebra]] upon their structures and thence defining [[homomorphism]] between the algebras. The insertion of action-driven causal links in a narrative can be achieved using the method of Bayesian narratives.

;Bayesian narratives
Developed by [[Peter Abell]], the theory of Bayesian Narratives conceives a narrative as a [[directed graph]] comprising multiple causal links (social interactions) of the general form: "action '''''a''''' causes action '''''b''''' in a specified context". In the absence of sufficient comparative cases to enable statistical treatment of the causal links, items of evidence in support and against a particular causal link are assembled and used to compute the Bayesian likelihood ratio of the link. Subjective causal statements of the form "I/she did '''b''' because of '''a'''" and subjective [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactuals]] "if it had not been for '''a''' I/she would not have done '''b'''" are notable items of evidence.&lt;ref name="abell2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abell2011"&gt;Abell, P. (2011) Singular Mechanisms and Bayesian Narratives in ed. Pierre Demeulenaere, ''Analytical Sociology and Social Mechanisms'' Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abell2009a"&gt;Abell, P. (2009) History, Case Studies, Statistics and Causal Inference, ''European Sociological review'', 25, 561–569&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
Linearity is one of several narrative qualities that can be found in a musical composition.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Gloag and David Beard, Musicology: The Key Concepts (New York: Routledge, 2009), 114&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by American musicologist, [[Edward Cone]], narrative terms are also present in the analytical language about music.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_a"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 113–117&lt;/ref&gt; The different components of a fugue — subject, answer, exposition, discussion and summary — can be cited as an example.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 115&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are several views on the concept of narrative in music and the role it plays.
One theory is that of Theodore Adorno, who has suggested that ‘music recites itself, is its own context, narrates without narrative’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag" /&gt; Another, is that of Carolyn Abbate, who has suggested that ‘certain gestures experienced in music constitute a narrating voice’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_a" /&gt; Still others have argued that narrative is a semiotic enterprise that can enrich musical analysis.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag" /&gt;
The French musicologist Jean-Jacques Nattiez contends that ‘the narrative, strictly speaking, is not in the music, but in the plot imagined and constructed by the listeners’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_b"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 116&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that discussing music in terms of [[narrativity]] is simply metaphorical and that the ‘imagined plot’ may be influenced by the work's title or other programmatic information provided by the composer.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_b" /&gt; However, Abbate has revealed numerous examples of musical devices that function as narrative voices, by limiting music’s ability to narrate to rare ‘moments that can be identified by their bizarre and disruptive effect’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_b" /&gt; Various theorists share this view of narrative appearing in disruptive rather than normative moments in music.
The final word is yet to be said, regarding narratives in music, as there is still much to be determined.

==In cultural storytelling==
A narrative can take on the shape of a story, which gives listeners an entertaining and collaborative avenue for acquiring knowledge. Many cultures use [[storytelling]] as a way to record histories, myths, and values. These stories can be seen as living entities of narrative among cultural communities, as they carry the shared experience and history of the culture within them. Stories are often used within [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|indigenous cultures]] in order to share knowledge to the younger generation.&lt;ref&gt;http://cojmc.unl.edu/nativedaughters/storytellers/native-storytellers-connect-the-past-and-the-future&lt;/ref&gt; Due to indigenous narratives leaving room for open-ended interpretation, native stories often engage children in the storytelling process so that they can make their own meaning and explanations within the story. This promotes holistic thinking among native children, which works towards merging an individual and world identity. Such an identity upholds native epistemology and gives children a sense of belonging as their cultural identity develops through the sharing and passing on of stories.&lt;ref&gt;Piquemal, N. 2003. From Native North American Oral Traditions to Western Literacy: Storytelling in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a number of indigenous stories are used to illustrate a value or lesson. In the [[Western Apache]] tribe, stories can be used to warn of the misfortune that befalls people when they do not follow acceptable behavior. One story speaks to the offense of a mother's meddling in her married son's life. In the story, the Western Apache tribe is under attack from a neighboring tribe, the Pimas. The Apache mother hears a scream. Thinking it is her son's wife screaming, she tries to intervene by yelling at him. This alerts the Pima tribe to her location, and she is promptly killed due to intervening in her son's life.&lt;ref&gt;Basso, 1984. "Stalking with Stories". Names, Places, and Moral Narratives Among the Western Apache.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous American cultures use [[Storytelling#Storytelling in indigenous cultures|storytelling]] to teach children the values and lessons of life. 
Although storytelling provides entertainment, its primary purpose is to educate.&lt;ref name="Hodge"&gt;Hodge, F., Pasqua, A., Marquez, C., &amp; Geishirt-Cantrell, B. (2002). Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian Communities. Journal of Transcultural Nursing, 6-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Alaskan Indigenous Natives state that narratives teach children where they fit in, what their society expects of them, how to create a peaceful living environment, and to be responsible, worthy members of their communities.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt; In the Mexican culture, many adult figures tell their children stories in order to teach children values such as individuality, obedience, honesty, trust, and compassion.&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;MacDonald, M., McDowell, J., Dégh, L., &amp; [[Toelken, B.]] (1999). Traditional storytelling today: An international sourcebook. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one of the versions of [[La Llorona]] is used to teach children to make safe decisions at night and to maintain the morals of the community.&lt;ref name="McDonald" /&gt;

Narratives are considered by the Canadian Métis community, to help children understand that the world around them is interconnected to their lives and communities.&lt;ref name="Iseke"&gt;Iseke, Judy. (1998). Learning Life Lessons from Indigenous Storytelling with Tom McCallum.
Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Métis community share the “Humorous Horse Story” to children, which portrays that horses stumble throughout life just like humans do.&lt;ref name="Iseke"/&gt; [[Navajo]] stories also use dead animals as metaphors by showing that all things have purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Eder, D. J. (2007). Bringing Navajo Storytelling Practices into Schools: The Importance of Maintaining Cultural Integrity. Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly, 38: 278–296.&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, elders from [[Alaska Natives|Alaskan Native]] communities claim that the use of animals as metaphors allow children to form their own perspectives while at the same time self-reflecting on their own lives.&lt;ref name="Iseke"/&gt;

[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] elders also state that storytelling invites the listeners, especially children, to draw their own conclusions and perspectives while self-reflecting upon their lives.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt; Furthermore, they insist that narratives help children grasp and obtain a wide range of perspectives that help them interpret their lives in the context of the story. American Indian community members emphasize to children that the method of obtaining knowledge can be found in stories passed down through each generation. Moreover, community members also let the children interpret and build a different perspective of each story.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt;

==Historiography==
In [[historiography]], according to [[Lawrence Stone]], narrative has traditionally been the main [[rhetorical device]] used by historians. In 1979, at a time when the new [[Social History]] was demanding a social-science model of analysis, Stone detected a move back toward the narrative. Stone defined narrative as organized chronologically; focused on a single coherent story; descriptive rather than analytical; concerned with people not abstract circumstances; and dealing with the particular and specific rather than the collective and statistical. He reported that, "More and more of the '[[new historian]]s' are now trying to discover what was going on inside people's heads in the past, and what it was like to live in the past, questions which inevitably lead back to the use of narrative."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Stone, "The Revival of Narrative: Reflections on a New Old History," ''Past and Present'' 85 (1979), pp. 3–24, quote on 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers identify narratives with a type of explanation. [[Mark Bevir]] argues, for example, that narratives explain actions by appealing to the beliefs and desires of actors and by locating webs of beliefs in the context of historical traditions. Narrative is an alternative form of explanation to that associated with natural science.

Historians committed to a social science approach, however, have criticized the narrowness of narrative and its preference for anecdote over analysis, and clever examples rather than statistical regularities.&lt;ref&gt;J. Morgan Kousser, "The Revivalism of Narrative: A Response to Recent Criticisms of Quantitative History," ''Social Science History'' vol 8, no. 2 (Spring 1984): 133–49; Eric H. Monkkonen, "The Dangers of Synthesis," ''American Historical Review'' 91, no. 5 (December 1986): 1146–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storytelling rights ==
Storytelling rights may be broadly defined as the ethics of sharing narratives (including—but not limited to—firsthand, secondhand and imagined stories). In ''Storytelling Rights: The uses of oral and written texts by urban adolescents'', author Amy Shuman offers the following definition of storytelling rights: “the important and precarious relationship between narrative and event and, specifically, between the participants in an event and the reporters who claim the right to talk about what happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13643520|title=Storytelling rights : the uses of oral and written texts by urban adolescents|last=1951-|first=Shuman, Amy,|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521328462|location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]|oclc=13643520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethics of retelling other people’s stories may be explored through a number of [[question]]s: whose [[Story arc|story]] is being told and how, what is the story’s purpose or aim, what does the story promise (for instance: empathy, redemption, authenticity, clarification)--and at whose benefit? Storytelling rights also implicates questions of consent, [[empathy]], and accurate representation. While storytelling—and retelling—can function as a powerful tool for [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] and [[advocacy]], it can also lead to misunderstanding and exploitation.

[[Storytelling]] rights is notably important in the [[genre]] of [[personal experience]] narrative. Academic disciplines such as [[performance]], [[folklore]], [[literature]], [[anthropology]], [[Cultural studies|Cultural Studies]] and other [[social science]]s may involve the study of storytelling rights, often hinging on ethics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13113">'''New Criticism''' was a [[Formalism (literature)|formalist]] movement in [[literary theory]] that dominated [[American literature|American]] [[literary criticism]] in the middle decades of the 20th century. It emphasized [[close reading]], particularly of [[poetry]], to discover how a work of literature functioned as a self-contained, self-referential aesthetic object. The movement derived its name from [[John Crowe Ransom]]'s 1941 book ''The New Criticism''.

The work of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] scholar [[I. A. Richards]], especially his  ''Practical Criticism'' and ''The Meaning of Meaning'', which offered what was claimed to be an empirical scientific approach, were important to the development of New Critical methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, Steven. ''Texts and Contexts: Writing about Literature with Critical Theory''. Addison-Wesley, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Also very influential were the [[T. S. Eliot#Literary Criticism|critical essays]] of [[T. S. Eliot]], such as "[[Tradition and the Individual Talent]]" and "[[Hamlet and His Problems]]", in which Eliot developed his notion of the "[[objective correlative]]". Eliot's evaluative judgments, such as his condemnation of Milton and Dryden, his liking for the so-called [[metaphysical poets]] and his insistence that poetry must be impersonal, greatly influenced the formation of the New Critical canon.

==Formalism theory==
New Criticism developed as a reaction to the older philological and literary history schools of the US North, which, influenced by nineteenth-century German scholarship, focused on the history and meaning of individual words and their relation to foreign and ancient languages, comparative sources, and the biographical circumstances of the authors. These approaches, it was felt, tended to distract from the text and meaning of a poem and entirely neglect its aesthetic qualities in favor of teaching about external factors. On the other hand, the literary appreciation school, which limited itself to pointing out the "beauties" and morally elevating qualities of the text, was disparaged by the New Critics as too subjective and emotional. Condemning this as a version of Romanticism, they aimed for newer, systematic and objective method.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview, see Gerald Graff, Professing Literature, Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was felt, especially by creative writers and by literary critics outside the academy, that the special aesthetic experience of poetry and literary language was lost in the welter of extraneous erudition and emotional effusions. Heather Dubrow notes that the prevailing focus of literary scholarship was on "the study of ethical values and philosophical issues through literature, the tracing of literary history, and ... political criticism". Literature was approached  and literary scholarship did not focus on analysis of texts.&lt;ref&gt;Dubrow, Heather. "Twentieth Century Shakespeare Criticism." ''The Riverside Shakespeare''. Houghton Mifflin, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

New Critics believed the structure and meaning of the text were intimately connected and should not be analyzed separately. In order to bring the focus of literary studies back to analysis of the texts, they aimed to exclude the reader's response, the author's intention, historical and cultural contexts, and moralistic bias from their analysis. These goals were articulated in Ransom's "Criticism, Inc." and [[Allen Tate]]'s "Miss Emily and the Bibliographers".

Close reading (or ''explication de texte'') was a staple of French literary studies, but in the United States, aesthetic concerns, and the study of modern poets was the province of non-academic essayists and book reviewers rather than serious scholars. The New Criticism changed this. Though their interest in textual study initially met with resistance from older scholars, the methods of the New Critics rapidly predominated in American universities until challenged by Feminism and [[structuralism]] in the 1970s. Other schools of critical theory, including, [[post-structuralism]], and [[Deconstruction|deconstructionist theory]], the [[New Historicism]], and Receptions studies followed.

Although the New Critics were never a formal group, an important inspiration was the teaching of [[John Crowe Ransom]] of [[Vanderbilt University]], whose students (all Southerners), [[Allen Tate]], [[Cleanth Brooks]], and [[Robert Penn Warren]] would go on to develop the aesthetics that came to be known as the New Criticism. Indeed, for Paul Lauter, a Professor of American Studies at [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]], New Criticism is a reemergence of the [[Southern Agrarians]].&lt;ref name="versionsofnashville"&gt;{{cite journal |first = Paul| last = Lauter| title="Versions of Nashville, Visions of American Studies": Presidential Address to the American Studies Association, October 27, 1994 |journal=American Quarterly |volume=47 |issue=2 |page=195 |jstor=2713279 | date = June 1995 |registration=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay, "The New Criticism", Cleanth Brooks notes that "The New Critic, like the [[Snark (Lewis Carroll)|Snark]], is a very elusive beast", meaning that there was no clearly defined "New Critical" manifesto, school, or stance.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Cleanth. "The New Criticism." ''The Sewanee Review'' 87: 4 (1979): 592.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a number of writings outline inter-related New Critical ideas.

In 1946, [[W. K. Wimsatt|William K. Wimsatt]] and [[Monroe Beardsley]] published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled "[[Intentional Fallacy|The Intentional Fallacy]]", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an [[Authorial intentionality|author's intention]], or "intended meaning" in the analysis of a literary work.  For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.

In another essay, "[[Affective fallacy|The Affective Fallacy]]", which served as a kind of sister essay to "The Intentional Fallacy" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the [[reader-response]] school of literary theory. One of the leading theorists from this school, [[Stanley Fish]], was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay "Literature in the Reader" (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, Vincent B. , et al., eds. ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hey-day of the New Criticism in American high schools and colleges was the Cold War decades between 1950 and the mid-seventies. Brooks and Warren's ''Understanding Poetry'' and ''Understanding Fiction'' both became staples during this era.

Studying a passage of prose or poetry in New Critical style required careful, exacting scrutiny of the passage itself. Formal elements such as [[rhyme]], meter, [[setting (fiction)|setting]], [[characterization]], and [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] were used to identify the [[theme (literature)|theme]] of the text. In addition to the theme, the New Critics also looked for [[paradox]], [[ambiguity]], [[irony]], and [[Suspense|tension]] to help establish the single best and most unified interpretation of the text.

Although the New Criticism is no longer a dominant theoretical model in American universities, some of its methods (like [[close reading]]) are still fundamental tools of literary criticism, underpinning a number of subsequent theoretic approaches to literature including poststructuralism, deconstruction theory, and [[reader-response theory]].

==Criticism==
It was frequently alleged that the New Criticism treated literary texts as autonomous and divorced from historical context, and that its practitioners were  “uninterested in the human meaning, the social function and effect of literature.” &lt;ref name="Wellek"&gt;Wellek, René. “The New Criticism: Pro and Contra.” ''Critical Inquiry'', Vol. 4, No. 4. (Summer, 1978), pp. 611–624. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1342947].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jancovich"&gt;{{cite book | last = Jancovich | first = Mark | title = The Cultural Politics of the New Criticism | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-521-41652-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indicative of the [[Reader-response criticism|reader-response school of theory]], Terence Hawkes writes that the fundamental close reading technique is based on the assumption that “the subject and the object of study—the reader and the text—are stable and independent forms, rather than products of the unconscious process of signification," an assumption which he identifies as the "ideology of liberal humanism,” which is attributed to the New Critics who are “accused of attempting to disguise the interests at work in their critical processes.”&lt;ref name="Jancovich"/&gt; For Hawkes, ideally, a critic ought to be considered to “[create] the finished work by his reading of it, and [not to] remain simply an inert consumer of a ‘ready-made’ product.”&lt;ref name="Jancovich"/&gt;

In response to critics like Hawkes, Cleanth Brooks, in his essay "The New Criticism" (1979), argued that the New Criticism was not diametrically opposed to the general principles of reader-response theory and that the two could complement one another. For instance, he stated, "If some of the New Critics have preferred to stress the writing rather than the writer, so have they given less stress to the reader—to the reader's response to the work. Yet no one in his right mind could forget the reader. He is essential for 'realizing' any poem or novel. . .Reader response is certainly worth studying." However, Brooks tempers his praise for the reader-response theory by noting its limitations, pointing out that, "to put meaning and valuation of a literary work at the mercy of any and every individual [reader] would reduce the study of literature to reader psychology and to the history of taste." &lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Cleanth. "The New Criticism." ''The Sewanee Review'' 87:4 (1979) 598.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another objection to the New Criticism is that it is thought to aim at making criticism scientific, or at least “bringing literary study to a condition rivaling that of science.”&lt;ref name="Wellek"/&gt; [[René Wellek]], however, points out the erroneous nature of this criticism by noting that a number of the New Critics outlined their theoretical aesthetics in stark contrast to the "objectivity" of the sciences (although Ransom, in his essay "Criticism, Inc." did advocate that "criticism must become more scientific, or precise and systematic").&lt;ref name="Wellek"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ransom, John Crowe. "Criticism, Inc." ''[[The Virginia Quarterly Review]]'', Autumn 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

At times, Wellek defended the New Critics in his essay “The New Criticism: Pro and Contra” (1978).

'''''On the Mysteries of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Assyrians''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Περὶ τῶν Αἰγυπτίων μυστηρίων}}), also known as the '''''Theurgia''''' and under its abbreviated [[Latin]] title '''''De Mysteriis Aegyptiorum''''' (''The Egyptian Mysteries''), is a work of [[Neoplatonic]] philosophy primarily concerned with [[ritual]] and [[theurgy]] and attributed to [[Iamblichus]].

[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] is known to have had a disagreement with Iamblichus over the practice of [[theurgy]], and the ''Mysteries'' consists mainly of Iamblichus' responses to the criticisms of his teacher.

[[Proclus]], writing 100 years after Iamblichus, seems to have ascribed to him the authorship of the ''Mysteries''. However, the differences between this book and Iamblichus' other works in style and in some points of doctrine have led some to question whether Iamblichus was the actual author. Still, the treatise certainly originated from his school, and in its systematic attempt to give a speculative justification of the polytheistic cult practices of the day, it marks a turning-point in the history of thought where Iamblichus stood.

'''Philip David Ochs''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|k|s}}; December 19, 1940 – April 9, 1976) was an American [[protest song|protest singer]] (or, as he preferred, a topical singer) and songwriter who was known for his sharp wit, sardonic humor, earnest humanism, political activism, insightful and alliterative lyrics, and distinctive voice. He wrote hundreds of songs in the 1960s and 1970s and released eight albums.

Ochs performed at many political events during the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture era]], including [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War]] and [[civil rights movement|civil rights]] rallies, student events, and [[Labour movement|organized labor]] events over the course of his career, in addition to many concert appearances at such venues as New York City's [[The Town Hall|Town Hall]] and [[Carnegie Hall]]. Politically, Ochs described himself as a "left social democrat"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dbs9f8S7mVYC&amp;lpg=PT815&amp;dq=phil%20ochs%20left%20social%20democrat&amp;pg=PT815#v=onepage&amp;q=left%20social%20democrat&amp;f=false|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Popular Music: From Adele to Ziggy, the Real A to Z of Rock and Pop|last=Jones|first=Dylan|date=2012-10-30|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9781250031884|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; who became an "early revolutionary" after the [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|protests]] at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in Chicago led to a [[police riot]], which had a profound effect on his state of mind.

After years of prolific writing in the 1960s, Ochs's mental stability declined in the 1970s. He eventually succumbed to a number of problems including [[bipolar disorder]] and [[alcoholism]], and committed suicide in 1976.

Some of Ochs's major musical influences were [[Woody Guthrie]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Buddy Holly]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Bob Gibson (musician)|Bob Gibson]], [[Faron Young]], and [[Merle Haggard]]. His best-known songs include "[[I Ain't Marching Anymore (song)|I Ain't Marching Anymore]]", "Changes", "[[Crucifixion (song)|Crucifixion]]", "[[Draft Dodger Rag]]", "[[Love Me, I'm a Liberal]]", "[[Outside of a Small Circle of Friends]]", "[[Power and the Glory]]", "[[There but for Fortune (song)|There but for Fortune]]", and "[[The War Is Over (Phil Ochs song)|The War Is Over]]".

==Biography==
===Early years===
Phil Ochs was born in [[El Paso, Texas]], to Jacob "Jack" Ochs, a physician who was born in New York on August 11, 1910,&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gertrude Phin Ochs, who was born on February 26, 1912,&lt;ref name="Cohen2"&gt;Cohen (1999), p.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSDI"&gt;{{cite web|author=Deceased Ancestor's Name |url=https://familysearch.org/search/collection/1202535 |title=United States Social Security Death Index |website=Familysearch.org |date=2016-06-14 |accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; His parents met and married in [[Edinburgh]] where Jack was attending medical school.&lt;ref name=Brend100&gt;Brend, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; After their marriage, they moved to the United States. Jack, drafted into the army, was sent overseas near the end of World War II, where he treated soldiers at the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. His war experiences affected his mental health and he received an honorable medical discharge in November 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Suffering from [[bipolar disorder]] and [[depression (mood)|depression]] on his return home, Jack  was unable to establish a successful medical practice and instead worked at a series of hospitals around the country.&lt;ref name=Brend100/&gt; As a result, the Ochs family moved frequently: to [[Far Rockaway, Queens|Far Rockaway]], New York, when Ochs was a teenager; then to [[Perrysburg (town), New York|Perrysburg]] in western New York, where he first studied music; and then to [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 20, 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ochs grew up with an older sister, [[Sonny Ochs|Sonia]] (known as Sonny, born 1937), and a younger brother, [[Michael Ochs|Michael]] (born 1943).&lt;ref name="Cohen2"/&gt; The Ochs family was middle class and Jewish, but not religious.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot (1989), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was distant from his wife and children, and was hospitalized for depression;&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 16–17, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; he died on April 30, 1963, from a cerebral hemorrhage;&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother died on March 9, 1994.&lt;ref name="SSDI"/&gt;

As a teenager, Ochs was recognized as a talented clarinet player; in an evaluation, one music instructor wrote: "You have exceptional musical feeling and the ability to transfer it on your instrument is abundant."&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; His musical skills allowed him to play clarinet with the orchestra at the [[Capital University|Capital University Conservatory of Music]] in Ohio, where he rose to the status of principal soloist before he was 16. Although Ochs played classical music, he soon became interested in other sounds he heard on the radio, such as early rock icons [[Buddy Holly]] and [[Elvis Presley]]&lt;ref name="wolf"/&gt; and country music artists including [[Faron Young]], [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Hank Williams|Hank Williams, Sr.]], and [[Johnny Cash]].&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 24–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Ochs also spent a lot of time at the movies. He especially liked big screen heroes such as [[John Wayne]]&lt;ref name="wolf"/&gt; and [[Audie Murphy]].&lt;ref name="Acoustic-Sonny"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.acousticmusicscene.com/2011/01/16/sonny-ochs-reflects-on-her-brother-phil-and-a-new-film-about-him/|title=Sonny Ochs Reflects on Her Brother Phil and a New Film About Him|last=Kornfeld |first=Michael|date=January 16, 2011|work=Acoustic Music Scene|accessdate=January 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, he developed an interest in movie rebels, including [[Marlon Brando]] and [[James Dean]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliot (1989), pp. 5, 8, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1956 to 1958, Ochs was a student at the [[Staunton Military Academy]] in rural Virginia, and when he graduated he returned to Columbus and enrolled in the [[Ohio State University]].&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 26–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Unhappy after his first quarter, he took a leave of absence and went to Florida. While in [[Miami]], the 18-year-old Ochs was jailed for two weeks for sleeping on a park bench, an incident he would later recall: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Somewhere during the course of those fifteen days I decided to become a writer. My primary thought was journalism ... so in a flash I decided — I'll be a writer and a major in journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=[[All the News That's Fit to Sing]]/[[I Ain't Marching Anymore]] |others=Phil Ochs |year=2001 |last=Doggett |first=P. |type=CD reissue |publisher=Elektra |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Bob Gibson c 1960 (JJH).jpg|thumb|80px|[[Bob Gibson (musician)|Bob Gibson]] was a major influence on Ochs's writing.]]
Ochs returned to Ohio State to study journalism and developed an interest in politics, with a particular interest in the [[Cuban Revolution]] of 1959. At Ohio State he met [[Jim Glover]], a fellow student who was a devotee of [[folk music]]. Glover introduced Ochs to the music of [[Pete Seeger]], [[Woody Guthrie]], and [[The Weavers]]. Glover taught Ochs how to play guitar, and they debated politics.&lt;ref name="Acoustic-Sonny"/&gt; Ochs began writing newspaper articles, often on radical themes. When the student paper refused to publish some of his more radical articles, he started his own underground newspaper called ''The Word''. His two main interests, politics and music, soon merged, and Ochs began writing topical political songs. Ochs and Glover formed a duet called "The Singing Socialists",&lt;ref name="uncut"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Power and the Glory|last=Houghton|first=Mick|author2=Allan Jones|date=March 2011|work=Uncut}} Page 60.&lt;/ref&gt; later renamed "The Sundowners", but the duo broke up before their first professional performance and Glover went to [[New York City]] to become a folksinger.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 33–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ochs's parents and brother had moved from Columbus to [[Cleveland]], and Ochs started to spend more time there, performing professionally at a local folk club called Farragher's Back Room. He was the opening act for a number of musicians in the summer of 1961, including the [[Smothers Brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Ochs met folksinger [[Bob Gibson (musician)|Bob Gibson]] that summer as well, and according to [[Dave Van Ronk]], Gibson became "''the'' seminal influence" on Ochs's writing.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Ochs continued at Ohio State into his senior year, but was bitterly disappointed at not being appointed editor-in-chief of the college newspaper, and dropped out in his last quarter without graduating. He left for New York, as Glover had, to become a folksinger.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1962–1966===
{{quote box |quote=In the early 1960s, there was a [[folk music]] rebirth in this country with the likes of [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Bob Dylan]]. Although his fame was probably limited, Ochs became an integral part of that crowd. His songs "[[Draft Dodger Rag]]" and "[[I Ain't Marching Anymore (song)|I Ain't Marching Anymore]]" became a rallying cry for the [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|peace movement]] much the way that Dylan's did. |salign=right |author=Leba Hertz |source="'Phil Ochs' Review: A Voice Made for Marching", ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', March 18, 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Phil-Ochs-review-A-voice-made-for-marching-2389322.php |title='Phil Ochs' Review: A Voice Made for Marching |first=Leba |last=Hertz |date=March 18, 2011 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |accessdate=November 20, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Ochs arrived in New York City in 1962 and began performing in numerous small folk nightclubs, eventually becoming an integral part of the [[Greenwich Village]] folk music scene.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; He emerged as an unpolished but passionate vocalist who wrote pointed songs about current events: [[war]], [[civil rights]], [[labour movement|labor struggles]] and other topics. While others described his music as "protest songs", Ochs preferred the term "topical songs".&lt;ref&gt;Brend, pp. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ochs described himself as a "singing journalist",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buckley |first=Peter |title=The Rough Guide to Rock: The Definitive Guide to More Than 1200 Artists and Bands |edition=3 |year=2003 |publisher=Rough Guides |location=London |isbn=978-1-85828-457-6 |page=742 }}&lt;/ref&gt; saying he built his songs from stories he read in ''[[Newsweek]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; By the summer of 1963, he was sufficiently well known in folk circles to be invited to sing at the [[Newport Folk Festival]], where he performed "Too Many Martyrs" (co-written with Bob Gibson), "Talking Birmingham Jam", and "[[Power and the Glory]]"—his patriotic Guthrie-esque anthem that brought the audience to its feet. Other performers at the 1963 folk festival included [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[Tom Paxton]].&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 59–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Ochs's return appearance at Newport in 1964, when he performed "Draft Dodger Rag" and other songs, was widely praised.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was not invited to appear in 1965, the festival when Dylan infamously performed "[[Maggie's Farm]]" with an electric guitar. Although many in the folk world decried Dylan's choice, Ochs was amused, and admired Dylan's courage in defying the folk establishment.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 98, 101–104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=Ochs |title=It Ain't Me, Babe |work=[[The Village Voice]] |date=August 12, 1967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1963, Ochs performed at New York's [[Carnegie Hall]] and [[The Town Hall|Town Hall]] in [[Hootenanny|hootenannies]].&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first solo appearance at Carnegie Hall in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 112–115.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his career, Ochs would perform at a wide range of venues, including civil rights rallies, anti-war demonstrations, and concert halls.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen (1999), pp. 12–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ochs contributed many songs and articles to the influential ''[[Broadside Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://folkways.si.edu/search?query=Phil+Ochs |title=Smithsonian Folkways Recordings |publisher=Folkways.si.edu |accessdate=March 24, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He recorded his first three albums for [[Elektra Records]]: ''[[All the News That's Fit to Sing]]'' (1964), ''[[I Ain't Marching Anymore]]'' (1965), and ''[[Phil Ochs in Concert]]'' (1966).&lt;ref&gt;Cohen (1999), pp. 189–191.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics wrote that each album was better than its predecessors, and fans seemed to agree; record sales increased with each new release.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 91–92, 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

On these records, Ochs was accompanied only by an acoustic guitar. The albums contain many of Ochs's topical songs, such as "Too Many Martyrs", "[[I Ain't Marching Anymore (song)|I Ain't Marching Anymore]]", and "Draft Dodger Rag"; and some musical reinterpretation of older poetry, such as "[[The Highwayman (poem)|The Highwayman]]" (poem by [[Alfred Noyes]]) and "[[The Bells (poem)|The Bells]]" (poem by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]). ''Phil Ochs in Concert'' includes some more introspective songs, such as "Changes" and "When I'm Gone".&lt;ref&gt;Eliot (1989), pp. 77, 86–89, 99–103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 76–77, 90–91, 116–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early period of his career, Ochs and Bob Dylan had a friendly rivalry. Dylan said of Ochs, "I just can't keep up with Phil. And he just keeps getting better and better and better".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Karl |last=Dallas |title=Dylan Said It—'I Can't Keep Up With Phil' |work=[[Melody Maker]] |page=10 |date=November 27, 1965 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion, when Ochs criticized [[Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?]] Dylan threw him out of his limousine, saying, "You're not a folksinger. You're a journalist".&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Ochs married Alice Skinner, who was pregnant with their daughter Meegan, in a [[Civil marriage|City Hall ceremony]] with [[Jim Glover]] as best man and [[Jim and Jean|Jean Ray]] as bridesmaid, and witnessed by Dylan's sometime girlfriend, [[Suze Rotolo]].&lt;ref name="Rotolo2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rotolo|first=Suze|authorlink=Suze Rotolo|title=A freewheelin' time: a memoir of Greenwich Village in the sixties|year=2008|publisher=Broadway Books|location=New York|isbn=0-7679-2687-0|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliot (1979), pp. 61-63.&lt;/ref&gt; Phil and Alice separated in 1965, but they never divorced.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 58, 67, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliot (1989), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many people of his generation, Ochs deeply admired President [[John F. Kennedy]], even though he disagreed with the president on issues such as the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], and the growing [[Role of the United States in the Vietnam War|involvement of the United States in the Vietnamese civil war]]. When Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, Ochs wept. He told his wife that he thought he was going to die that night. It was the only time she ever saw Ochs cry.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ochs's managers during this part of his career were [[Albert Grossman]] (who also managed Dylan and Peter, Paul, and Mary) followed by [[Arthur Gorson]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliot (1989), p. 64, 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Gorson had close ties with such groups as [[Americans For Democratic Action]], the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], and [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliot (1989), pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ochs was writing songs at an amazing pace. Some of the songs he wrote during this period were held back and recorded on his later albums.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 118, 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1967–1969===
In 1967, Ochs—now managed by his brother Michael—left Elektra for [[A&amp;M Records]] and moved to [[Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 129–130, 134.&lt;/ref&gt; He recorded four studio albums for A&amp;M: ''[[Pleasures of the Harbor]]'' (1967), ''[[Tape from California]]'' (1968), ''[[Rehearsals for Retirement]]'' (1969), and the ironically titled ''[[Greatest Hits (Phil Ochs)|Greatest Hits]]'' (1970) (which actually consisted of all new material).&lt;ref&gt;Cohen (1999), pp. 191–193.&lt;/ref&gt; For his A&amp;M albums, Ochs moved away from simply produced solo acoustic guitar performances and experimented with ensemble and even orchestral instrumentation, "baroque-folk",&lt;ref&gt;Brend, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; in the hopes of producing a [[pop music|pop]]-folk hybrid that would be a [[Hit single|hit]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliot (1989), pp. 131–133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic [[Robert Christgau]], writing in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' of ''Pleasures of the Harbor'' in May 1968, did not consider this new direction a good turn. While describing Ochs as "unquestionably a nice guy", he went on to say, "too bad his voice shows an effective range of about half an octave [and] his guitar playing would not suffer much if his right hand were webbed." "''Pleasures of the Harbor''", Christgau continued, "epitomizes the decadence that has infected pop since ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|Sgt. Pepper]]''. [The] gaudy musical settings ... inspire nostalgia for the three-chord strum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-aow/column3.php |title=Dylan-Beatles-Stones-Donovan-Who, Dionne Warwick and Dusty Springfield, John Fred, California |accessdate=January 24, 2009 |last=Christgau |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Christgau |date=May 1968 |work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; With an ironic sense of humor, Ochs included Christgau's "webbed hand" comment in his 1968 songbook ''The War is Over'' on a page titled "The Critics Raved", opposite a full-page picture of Ochs standing in a large metal garbage can.&lt;ref&gt;Ochs (1968), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his sense of humor, Ochs was unhappy that his work was not receiving the critical acclaim and popular success he had hoped for.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, Ochs would joke on the back cover of ''Greatest Hits'' that there were 50 Phil Ochs fans ("50 fans can't be wrong!"), a sarcastic reference to an Elvis Presley album that bragged of [[50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong|50 million Elvis fans]].&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

None of Ochs's songs became hits, although "Outside of a Small Circle of Friends" received a good deal of [[Airplay (radio)|airplay]]. It reached #119 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s national "Hot Prospect" listing before being pulled from some radio stations because of its lyrics, which sarcastically suggested that "smoking marijuana is more fun than drinking beer".&lt;ref&gt;Eliot (1989), pp. 136–137.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the closest Ochs ever came to the Top 40. Joan Baez, however, did have a Top Ten hit in the U.K. in August 1965, reaching #8 with her cover of Ochs's song "There but for Fortune",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Warner |first=Jay |title=Notable Moments of Women in Music |year=2008 |publisher=Hal Leonard |location=Milwaukee, Wisc. |isbn=978-1-4234-2951-7 |page=133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pc34&gt;{{Pop Chronicles|34|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was also nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for "Best Folk Recording".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Timothy Dean |title=Global Pop: World Music, World Markets |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-91872-5 |page=225 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. it peaked at #50 on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1917|pure_url=yes}} |title=Billboard singles |publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | accessdate=February 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—a good showing, but not a hit.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he was trying new things musically, Ochs did not abandon his protest roots. He was profoundly concerned with the escalation of the Vietnam War, performing tirelessly at anti-war rallies across the country. In 1967 he organized two rallies to declare that "The War Is Over"—"Is everybody sick of this stinking war? In that case, friends, do what I and thousands of other Americans have done—declare the war over."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=Ochs |title=Have You Heard? The War is Over! |work=[[The Village Voice]] |publisher= |date=November 23, 1967 }}; reprinted in Ochs (1968), p. 92; excerpted in Schumacher, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;—one in Los Angeles in June, the other in New York in November.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 139–148, 170–173.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to write and record anti-war songs, such as "The War Is Over" and "White Boots Marching in a Yellow Land". Other topical songs of this period include "Outside of a Small Circle of Friends", inspired by the [[murder of Kitty Genovese]], who was stabbed to death outside of her New York City apartment building while dozens of her neighbors reportedly ignored her cries for help, and "William Butler Yeats Visits Lincoln Park and Escapes Unscathed", about the despair he felt in the aftermath of the Chicago [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] [[police riot]].&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 149, 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ochs was writing more personal songs as well, such as "Crucifixion", in which he compared the deaths of Jesus Christ and assassinated President [[John F. Kennedy]] as part of a "cycle of sacrifice" in which people build up heroes and then celebrate their destruction; "Chords of Fame", a warning against the dangers and corruption of fame; "Pleasures of the Harbor", a lyrical portrait of a lonely sailor seeking human connection far from home; and "Boy in Ohio", a plaintive look back at Ochs's childhood in Columbus.&lt;ref name="Eliot 1989, p. 193"&gt;Eliot (1989), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 110, 160, 214–215, 223–224.&lt;/ref&gt;

A lifelong movie fan, Ochs worked the narratives of justice and rebellion that he had seen in films into his music, describing some of his songs as "cinematic".&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the spoken introduction to "Ringing of Revolution" on ''[[Phil Ochs in Concert]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He was disappointed and bitter when his onetime hero John Wayne embraced the [[Vietnam War]] with what Ochs saw as the blind patriotism of Wayne's 1968 film, ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;[H]ere we have John Wayne, who was a major artistic and psychological figure on the American scene, ... who at one point used to make movies of soldiers who had a certain validity, ... a certain sense of honor [about] what the soldier was doing.... Even if it was a cavalry movie doing a historically dishonorable thing to the Indians, even as there was a feeling of what it meant to be a man, what it meant to have some sense of duty.... Now today we have the same actor making his new war movie in a war so hopelessly corrupt that, without seeing the movie, I'm sure it is perfectly safe to say that it will be an almost {{Sic|?|hide=y|technically|-}}robot-view of soldiery, just by definition of how the whole country has deteriorated. And I think it would make a very interesting double feature to show a good old Wayne movie like, say, ''She Wore a Yellow Ribbon'' with ''The Green Berets''. Because that would make a very striking comment on what has happened to America in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cunningham |first=Sis |authorlink=Sis Cunningham |author2=[[Gordon Friesen]]  |year=1968 |title=Interview with Phil Ochs |journal=[[Broadside Magazine]] |issue=91 }}; quoted in Schumacher, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ochs was involved in the creation of the [[Youth International Party]], known as the Yippies, along with [[Jerry Rubin]], [[Abbie Hoffman]], [[Stew Albert]], and [[Paul Krassner]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliot (1989), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Ochs actively supported [[Eugene McCarthy]]'s more mainstream bid for the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1968|1968 Democratic nomination for President]], a position at odds with the more radical Yippie point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, p. 182–184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Despite their disagreements, the Yippies used several Ochs songs in their media, in particular the anti-war "I Ain't Marching Anymore". For example, see [http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/videodir/pacificaviet/yippie.ram this Yippie-produced documentary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528201004/http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/videodir/pacificaviet/yippie.ram |date=May 28, 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, Ochs helped plan the Yippies' "[[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|Festival of Life]]" which was to take place at the 1968 Democratic National Convention along with demonstrations by other anti-war groups including the [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;Brend, pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite warnings that there might be trouble, Ochs went to Chicago both as a guest of the McCarthy campaign and to participate in the demonstrations. He performed in [[Lincoln Park]], [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], and at the [[Chicago Coliseum]], witnessed the violence perpetrated by the Chicago police against the protesters, and was himself arrested at one point.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 194–196.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the documentary film [https://vimeo.com/64409865 ''Conventions: The Land Around Us''] at [[Vimeo]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:REHEARSALS.jpg|thumb|right|The cover of Ochs's 1969 album, ''Rehearsals for Retirement'']]
The events of 1968—the assassinations of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and [[Robert F. Kennedy]], the police riot in Chicago, and the election of [[Richard Nixon]]—left Ochs feeling disillusioned and depressed.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 201, 204.&lt;/ref&gt; The cover of his 1969 album ''[[Rehearsals for Retirement]]'' eerily portrays a tombstone with the words:
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;
PHIL OCHS&lt;br&gt;
(AMERICAN)&lt;br&gt;
BORN: EL PASO, TEXAS, 1940&lt;br&gt;
DIED: CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, 1968&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--don't change this, Chicago 1968 is correct, it is not his literal death, it is a reference to the events surrounding the 1968 Democratic Convention--&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

At the trial of the [[Chicago Seven]] in December 1969, Ochs testified for the defense. His testimony included his recitation of the lyrics to his song "I Ain't Marching Anymore". On his way out of the courthouse, Ochs sang the song for the press corps; to Ochs's amusement, his singing was broadcast that evening by [[Walter Cronkite]] on the [[CBS Evening News]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliot (1989), pp. 175–188.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970===
After the riot in Chicago and the subsequent trial, Ochs changed direction again. The events of 1968 convinced him that the average American was not listening to topical songs or responding to Yippie tactics. Ochs thought that by playing the sort of music that had moved him as a teenager he could speak more directly to the American public.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 222–223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ochs turned to his musical roots in country music and early rock and roll.&lt;ref name=Schumacher224&gt;Schumacher, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; He decided he needed to be "part Elvis Presley and part [[Che Guevara]]",&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; so he commissioned a [[Lamé (fabric)|gold lamé]] suit from Elvis Presley's costumer [[Nudie Cohn]].&lt;ref&gt;Brend, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Ochs wore the gold suit on the cover of his 1970 album, ''[[Greatest Hits (Phil Ochs album)|Greatest Hits]]'', which consisted of new songs largely in rock and country styles.&lt;ref name="Eliot 1989, p. 193"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schumacher224/&gt;

Ochs went on tour wearing the gold suit, backed by a rock band, singing his own material along with medleys of songs by Buddy Holly, Elvis, and Merle Haggard. His fans did not know how to respond. This new Phil Ochs drew a hostile reaction from his audience. Ochs's March 27, 1970, concerts at [[Carnegie Hall]] were the most successful, and by the end of that night's second show Ochs had won over many in the crowd.&lt;ref name="wolf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/WolfFiles/story?id=92624|title=The Sad End of the First Elvis Impersonator|last=Wolf|first=Buck|date=August 16, 2001|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was recorded and released as ''[[Gunfight at Carnegie Hall]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 227–233.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, Ochs was taking drugs to get through performances. He had been taking [[Valium]] for years to help control his nerves, and he was also drinking heavily.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 216–217, 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Pianist [[Lincoln Mayorga]] said of that period, "He was physically abusing himself very badly on that tour. He was drinking a lot of wine and taking uppers. The wine was pulling him one way and the uppers were pulling him another way, and he was kind of a mess. There were so many pharmaceuticals around—so many pills. I'd never seen anything like that."&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Ochs tried to cut back on the pills, but alcohol remained his drug of choice for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=Eliot&gt;Eliot (1989), pp. 207, 213, 236.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schumacher&gt;Schumacher, pp. 260, 265, 275, 301–302, 310–311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Depressed by his lack of widespread appreciation and suffering from [[writer's block]], Ochs did not record any further albums.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 226, 235, 255.&lt;/ref&gt; He slipped deeper into depression and alcoholism.&lt;ref name=Eliot/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schumacher/&gt; His personal problems notwithstanding, Ochs performed at the inaugural benefit for [[Greenpeace]] on October 16, 1970, at the [[Pacific Coliseum]] in [[Vancouver, BC]]. A [[Amchitka (album)|recording]] of his performance, along with performances by Joni Mitchell and James Taylor, was released by Greenpeace in 2009.

===1971–1975===

Typed at apartment of [[Chip Berlet]] in 1974 prior to Ochs's performance of the song at Impeachment Ball. Copy sent to his brother Michael Ochs for registration. Original at [[Chicago History Museum]].]]

In August 1971, Ochs went to Chile, where [[Salvador Allende]], a [[Marxism|Marxist]], had been democratically elected in the [[1970 Chilean presidential election|1970 election]]. There he met [[Chile]]an folksinger [[Víctor Jara]], an Allende supporter, and the two became friends. In October, Ochs left Chile to visit [[Argentina]]. Later that month, after singing at a political rally in [[Uruguay]], he and his American traveling companion David Ifshin were arrested and detained overnight. When the two returned to Argentina, they were arrested as they got off the airplane. After a brief stay in an Argentinian prison, Ochs and Ifshin were sent to [[Bolivia]] via a commercial airliner where authorities were to detain them. Ifshin had previously been warned by Argentinian leftist friends that when the authorities sent dissidents to Bolivia, they would disappear forever. When the airliner arrived in Bolivia, the American captain of the [[Braniff International Airways]] aircraft allowed Ochs and Ifshin to stay on the aircraft, and barred Bolivian authorities from entering. The aircraft then flew to [[Peru]] where the two disembarked and they were not detained. Fearful that Peruvian authorities might arrest him, Ochs returned to the United States a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 239–253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ochs was having difficulties writing new songs during this period, but he had occasional breakthroughs. He updated his sarcastic song "[[Here's to the State of Mississippi]]" as "Here's to the State of Richard Nixon", with cutting lines such as "the speeches of the Spiro are the ravings of a clown", a reference to Nixon's vitriolic vice president, [[Spiro Agnew]]—sung as "the speeches of the President are the ravings of a clown" after Agnew's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The "Spiro" lyrics can be heard in {{YouTube|Qxk0x5wuRH0|this clip}} from the 1971 "Free John Sinclair" rally. The "President" lyrics can be heard in the 1974 [[Single (music)|single]] release.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ochs was personally invited by [[John Lennon]] to sing at a large benefit at the University of Michigan in December 1971 on behalf of [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]], an activist poet who had been arrested on minor drug charges and given a severe sentence. Ochs performed at the [[John Sinclair Freedom Rally]] along with [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[David Peel (musician)|David Peel]], [[Abbie Hoffman]] and many others. The rally culminated with Lennon and [[Yoko Ono]], who were making their first public performance in the United States since the breakup of [[The Beatles]].&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 256–259.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the 1968 election had left him deeply disillusioned, Ochs continued to work for the election campaigns of anti-war candidates, such as [[George McGovern]]'s unsuccessful [[United States presidential election, 1972|Presidential bid in 1972]].&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 262–263.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Ochs was asked to write the theme song for the film ''[[Kansas City Bomber]]''. The task proved difficult, as Ochs struggled to overcome his writer's block. Although [[Kansas City Bomber (song)|his song]] was not used in the soundtrack, it was released as a [[Single (music)|single]].&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 263–264, 269, 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ochs decided to travel. In mid-1972, he went to [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 264–271.&lt;/ref&gt; He traveled to Africa in 1973, where he visited [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], [[Malawi]], and [[South Africa]]. One night, Ochs was attacked and strangled by robbers in [[Dar es Salaam, Tanzania]], which damaged his vocal cords, causing a loss of the top three notes in his vocal range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phil Ochs Biography|url=http://www.sonnyochs.com/philbio.html | publisher=SonnyOchs.com| accessdate=April 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack also exacerbated his growing mental problems, and he became increasingly paranoid. Ochs believed the attack may have been arranged by government agents—perhaps the CIA. Still, he continued his trip, even recording a single in Kenya, "[[Bwatue]]".&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 279–285.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 11, 1973, the Allende government of Chile was overthrown in a ''[[1973 Chilean coup d'état|coup d'état]]''. Allende committed suicide during the bombing of the presidential palace, and singer Victor Jara was publicly tortured and killed. When Ochs heard about the manner in which his friend had been killed, he was outraged and decided to organize a benefit concert to bring to public attention the situation in Chile, and raise funds for the people of Chile. The concert, "An Evening with Salvador Allende", included films of Allende; singers such as [[Pete Seeger]], [[Arlo Guthrie]], and Bob Dylan; and political activists such as former [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] [[Ramsey Clark]]. Dylan had agreed to perform at the last minute when he heard that the concert had sold so few tickets that it was in danger of being canceled. Once his participation was announced, the event quickly sold out.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 287–297.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Chile benefit, Ochs and Dylan discussed the possibility of a joint concert tour, playing small nightclubs. Nothing came of the Dylan-Ochs plans, but the idea eventually evolved into Dylan's [[Rolling Thunder Revue]].&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 298–299.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vietnam War ended on April 30, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schomp |first=Virginia |title=The Vietnam War |year=2002 |publisher=Benchmark Books |location=Tarrytown, N.Y. |isbn=978-0-7614-1099-7 |page=78 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LmwPV6wGkCoC&amp;pg=PA78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ochs planned a final "War Is Over" rally, which was held in New York's [[Central Park]] on May 11. More than 100,000 people came to hear Ochs, joined by [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Odetta]], Pete Seeger and others. Ochs and Joan Baez sang a duet of "There but for Fortune" and he closed with his song "[[The War Is Over (Phil Ochs song)|The War Is Over]]"—finally a true declaration that the war was over.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 304–306.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline and death===
[[File:20111015 174748 phil-ochs (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Ochs outside the offices of the [[National Student Association]] in Washington, D.C., in 1975]]
Ochs's drinking became more and more of a problem, and his behavior became increasingly erratic. He frightened his friends both with his drunken rants about the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], and about his claiming to want to have Elvis's manager [[Colonel Tom Parker]] or [[KFC|Kentucky Fried Chicken]]'s [[Colonel Sanders]] manage his career.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 310–311.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1975, Ochs [[dissociative identity disorder|took on the identity]] of John Butler Train. He told people that Train had murdered Ochs, and that he, John Butler Train, had replaced him. Train was convinced that someone was trying to kill him, so he carried a weapon at all times: a hammer, a knife, or a lead pipe.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 312–318&lt;/ref&gt;

Ochs's friends tried to help him. His brother Michael attempted to have him committed to a [[psychiatric hospital]]. Friends pleaded with him to get help voluntarily. They feared for his safety, because he was getting into fights with bar patrons. Unable to pay his rent, he began living on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 327–333.&lt;/ref&gt;

After several months, the Train persona faded and Ochs returned, but his talk of suicide disturbed his friends and family. They hoped it was a passing phase, but Ochs was determined.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 339–341.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his biographers explains Ochs's motivation:

{{quote|By Phil's thinking, he had died a long time ago: he had died politically in Chicago in 1968 in the violence of the Democratic National Convention; he had died professionally in Africa a few years later, when he had been strangled and felt that he could no longer sing; he had died spiritually when Chile had been overthrown and his friend Victor Jara had been brutally murdered; and, finally, he had died psychologically at the hands of John Train.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In January 1976, Ochs moved to Far Rockaway, New York, to live with his sister Sonny. He was lethargic; his only activities were watching television and [[card game|playing cards]] with his nephews. Ochs saw a psychiatrist, who diagnosed his [[bipolar disorder]]. He was prescribed medication, and he told his sister he was taking it.&lt;ref&gt;After Ochs's death, his sister found he had been lying about taking his medication. Schumacher, p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 9, 1976, Ochs committed suicide by [[Hanging#As suicide|hanging himself]] in Sonny's home.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, pp. 344–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

Years after his death, it was revealed that the FBI had a file of nearly 500 pages on Ochs.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the information in those files relates to his association with [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] figures, protest organizers, musicians, and other people described by the FBI as "subversive".&lt;ref name="Eliot301-308"&gt;Eliot (1989), pp. 301–308.&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI was often sloppy in collecting information on Ochs: his name was frequently misspelled "Oakes" in their files, and they continued to consider him "potentially dangerous"&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt; after his death.&lt;ref name="Eliot301-308"/&gt;

Congresswoman [[Bella Abzug]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from New York), an outspoken anti-war activist herself who had appeared at the 1975 "War is Over" rally, entered this statement into the ''[[Congressional Record]]'' on April 29, 1976:

{{quote|Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, a young folksinger whose music personified the protest mood of the 1960s took his own life. Phil Ochs—whose original compositions were compelling moral statements against war in Southeast Asia—apparently felt that he had run out of words.

While his tragic action was undoubtedly motivated by terrible personal despair, his death is a political as well as an artistic tragedy. I believe it is indicative of the despair many of the activists of the 1960s are experiencing as they perceive a government which continues the distortion of national priorities that is exemplified in the military budget we have before us.

Phil Ochs's poetic pronouncements were part of a larger effort to galvanize his generation into taking action to prevent war, racism, and poverty. He left us a legacy of important songs that continue to be relevant in 1976—even though "the war is over".

Just one year ago—during this week of the anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War—Phil recruited entertainers to appear at the "War is Over" celebration in Central Park, at which I spoke.

It seems particularly appropriate that this week we should commemorate the contributions of this extraordinary young man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abzug |first=Bella |authorlink=Bella Abzug |title=Death of Phil Ochs| date=April 29, 1976 |journal=[[Congressional Record]] |volume=122 |issue=10 }}, quoted in Schumacher, pp. 354–355.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Robert Christgau, who had been so critical of ''[[Pleasures of the Harbor]]'' and Ochs's guitar skills eight years earlier, wrote warmly of Ochs in his obituary in ''[[The Village Voice]]''. "I came around to liking Phil Ochs's music, guitar included," Christgau wrote. "My affection [for Ochs] no doubt prejudiced me, so it is worth [noting] that many observers who care more for folk music than I do remember both his compositions and his vibrato tenor as close to the peak of the genre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/rock/ochs-76.php |title=Phil Ochs 1940-1976 |accessdate=January 28, 2009 |last=Christgau |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Christgau |date=April 19, 1976 |work=[[The Village Voice]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phil Ochs's commitment to fighting against the Vietnam War started early. In 1964, Phil Ochs performed his song ''Talking Vietnam Blues,'' "the first protest song to directly refer to Vietnam by name."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Auslander|first=Ben H.|date=Summer 1981|title=If You Wanna End War And Stuff, You Gotta Sing Loud|url=|journal=Journal of American Culture|volume=4|pages=108|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14168">'''Psychoanalytic literary criticism''' is [[literary criticism]] or [[literary theory]] which, in method, concept, or form, is influenced by the tradition of [[psychoanalysis]] begun by [[Sigmund Freud]].

Psychoanalytic reading has been practiced since the early development of psychoanalysis itself, and has developed into a heterogeneous interpretive tradition. As [[Celine Surprenant]] writes, 'Psychoanalytic literary criticism does not constitute a unified field. However, all variants endorse, at least to a certain degree, the idea that literature ... is fundamentally entwined with the psyche'.&lt;ref&gt;Celine Surprenant, 'Freud and Psychoanalysis' in Patricia Waugh ed., ''Literary Theory and Criticism'' (OUP 2006) p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The object of psychoanalytic literary criticism, at its very simplest, can be the psychoanalysis of the [[author]] or of a particularly interesting character in a given work. The criticism is similar to psychoanalysis itself, closely following the analytic interpretive process discussed in Freud's ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' and other works. Critics may view the fictional characters as psychological [[case study|case studies]], attempting to identify such Freudian concepts as the [[Oedipus complex]], [[Freudian slip]]s, [[Id, ego and superego]], and so on, and demonstrate how they influence the thoughts and behaviors of fictional characters.

However, more complex variations of psychoanalytic criticism are possible. The concepts of psychoanalysis can be deployed with reference to the narrative or poetic structure itself, without requiring access to the authorial psyche (an interpretation motivated by French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]'s remark that "the unconscious is structured like a language"). Or the founding texts of psychoanalysis may themselves be treated as literature, and re-read for the light cast by their formal qualities on their theoretical content (Freud's texts frequently resemble [[Detective fiction|detective stories]], or the archaeological narratives of which he was so fond).

Like all forms of literary criticism, psychoanalytic criticism can yield useful clues to the sometime baffling symbols, actions, and settings in a literary work; however, like all forms of literary criticism, it has its limits. For one thing, some critics rely on psychocriticism as a "one size fits all" approach, when other literary scholars argue that no one approach can adequately illuminate or interpret a complex work of art. As Guerin, et al. put it in ''A Handbook of Critical Approaches to Literature'',&lt;ref&gt;Guerin, Wilfred L., et al., A Handbook of Critical Approaches to Literature (Harper &amp; Row, 1979). {{ISBN|0-06-042554-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The danger is that the serious student may become theory-ridden, forgetting that Freud's is not the only approach to literary criticism. To see a great work of fiction or a great poem primarily as a psychological case study is often to miss its wider significance and perhaps even the essential aesthetic experience it should provide.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Methods==
===Early applications===
Freud wrote several important essays on literature, which he used to explore the psyche of authors and characters, to explain narrative mysteries, and to develop new concepts in psychoanalysis (for instance, ''[[Delusion and Dream in Jensen's Gradiva]]'' and his influential readings of the [[Oedipus]] myth and [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' in ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]''). The criticism has been made, however, that in his and his early followers' studies 'what calls for elucidation are not the artistic and literary works themselves, but rather the psychopathology and biography of the artist, writer or fictional characters'.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; Thus 'many psychoanalysts among Freud's earliest adherents did not resist the temptation to psychoanalyze poets and painters (sometimes to Freud's chagrin').&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud: A Life for Our Time'' (London 1989) p. 764&lt;/ref&gt; Later analysts would conclude that 'clearly one cannot psychoanalyse a writer from his text; one can only appropriate him'.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Early psychoanalytic literary criticism would often treat the text as if it were a kind of [[dream]]. This means that the text represses its real (or latent) content behind obvious (manifest) content. The process of changing from latent to manifest content is known as the dream work, and involves operations of concentration and  [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]].  The critic analyzes the language and [[symbol]]ism of a text to reverse the process of the dream work and arrive at the underlying latent thoughts. The danger is that 'such criticism tends to be reductive, explaining away the ambiguities of works of literature by reference to established psychoanalytic doctrine; and very little of this work retains much influence today'.&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (New York 1995) p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jungians===
Later readers, such as [[Carl Jung]] and another of Freud's disciples, [[Karen Horney]], broke with Freud, and their work, especially Jung's, led to other rich branches of psychoanalytic criticism: Horney's to feminist approaches including [[womb envy]], and Jung's to the study of [[archetypes]] and the [[collective unconscious]]. Jung's  work in particular was influential as, combined with the work of anthropologists such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Joseph Campbell]], it led to the entire fields of [[mythocriticism]] and archetype analysis.

[[Northrop Frye]] considered that 'the literary critic finds Freud most suggestive for the theory of comedy, and Jung for the theory of romance'.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (Princeton 1973) p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

===Form===
Waugh writes, 'The development of psychoanalytic approaches to literature proceeds from the shift of emphasis from "content" to the fabric of artistic and literary works'.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for example [[Hayden White]] has explored how 'Freud's descriptions tally with nineteenth-century theories of [[Trope (literature)|tropes]], which his work somehow reinvents'.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially influential here has been the work of [[Jacques Lacan]], an avid reader of literature who used literary examples as illustrations of important concepts in his work (for instance, Lacan argued with [[Jacques Derrida]] over the interpretation of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Purloined Letter]]").

'Lacan's theories have encouraged a criticism which focuses not on the author but on the linguistic processes of the text'.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (Cambridge 1995) p. 767&lt;/ref&gt; Within this Lacanian emphasis, 'Freud's theories become a place from which to raise questions of interpretation, rhetoric, style, and figuration'.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Lacanian scholars have noted that Lacan himself was not interested in literary criticism ''per se'', but in how literature might illustrate a psychoanalytic method or concept.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Dylan (2005). "From Lacan to Darwin" in ''The Literary Animal; Evolution and the Nature of Narrative'', eds. Jonathan Gottschall and David Sloan Wilson, Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 2005, pp.38-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reader response===
According to Ousby, 'Among modern critical uses of psychoanalysis is the development of "[[ego psychology]]" in the work of [[Norman Holland]], who concentrates on the relations between reader and text'&lt;ref&gt;Ousby ed., p. 767&lt;/ref&gt; - as with [[reader response criticism]].  Rollin writes that 'Holland's experiments in reader response theory suggest that we all read literature selectively, unconsciously projecting our own fantasies into it'.&lt;ref&gt;L. Rollin/M. I. West, ''Psychoanalytic Responses to Children's Literature'' (2008) p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus in [[crime fiction]], for example, '[[Charles Rycroft|Rycroft]] sees the criminal as personifying the reader's unavowed hostility to the parent'.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Shepherd, ''Sherlock Holmes and the Case of Dr Freud'' (London 1985) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Mauron: psychocriticism===
In 1963, [[Charles Mauron]]&lt;ref&gt;Des métaphores obsédantes au mythe ersonnel&lt;/ref&gt; conceived a structured method to interpret literary works via psychoanalysis. The study implied four different phases:
# The creative process is akin to dreaming awake: as such, it is a [[mimesis|mimetic]], and [[cathartic]], representation of an innate desire that is best expressed and revealed by '''metaphors''' and symbolically.
# Then, the juxtaposition of a writer's works leads the critic to define symbolical themes.
# These metaphorical networks are significant of a latent inner reality.
# They point at an obsession just as dreams can do. The last phase consists in linking the writer's literary creation to his own personal life.

On Mauron's concept, the author cannot be reduced to a ratiocinating self: his own more or less [[Psychological trauma|traumatic]] biographical past, the cultural [[archetypes]] that have suffused his "soul" contrast with the conscious self, The chiasmic relation between the two tales may be seen as a sane and safe [[acting out]]. A basically [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] sexual impulse is symbolically fulfilled in a positive and socially gratifying way, a process known as [[Sublimation (psychology)|Sublimation]].

===Anxiety of influence===
'The American critic [[Harold Bloom]] has adopted the Freudian notion of the [[Oedipus Complex]] to his study of relationships of influence between poets...and his work has also inspired a [[feminist]] variant in the work of [[Sandra Gilbert]] and [[Susan Gubar]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Childers/Hentzi eds., p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

In similar vein, [[Shoshana Felman]] has asked with respect to what she calls "''the guilt of poetry''" the question: 'Could literary history be in any way considered as a repetitive unconscious ''[[transference]]'' of the guilt of poetry?'.&lt;ref&gt;Shoshana Felman, ''Jacques Lacan and the Adventures of Insight'' (Harvard 1987) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural examples==
In ''[[Small World: An Academic Romance]]'', one of [[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]]'s satires of academia, the naive hero Persse follows Angelica to a forum where she discourses on Romance: '"[[Roland Barthes]] has taught us the close connection between narrative and sexuality, between the pleasures of the body and the 'pleasure of the text'....Romance is a multiple orgasm." Persse listened to this stream of filth flowing from between Angelica's exquisite lips and pearly teeth with growing astonishment and burning cheeks, but no one else in the audience seemed to find anything remarkable or disturbing about her presentation'.&lt;ref&gt;David Lodge, ''Small World'' (Penguin 1985) p. 322-3&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[A.S. Byatt]]'s novel ''[[Possession (Byatt novel)|Possession]]'', the heroine/feminist scholar, while recognising that '"we live in the truth of what Freud discovered"', concedes that '"the whole of our scholarship – the whole of our thought – we question everything except the centrality of sexuality"'.&lt;ref&gt;A. S Byatt, ''Possession: A Romance'' (London 1990) p. 254 and p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Romanesque architecture'''  is an [[architectural style]] of [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] characterized by semi-circular [[arch]]es. There is no consensus for the beginning date of the Romanesque style, with proposals ranging from the 6th to the 11th century, this later date being the most commonly held. In the 12th century it developed into the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]], marked by pointed arches. Examples of Romanesque architecture can be found across the continent, making it the first pan-European architectural style since [[Roman architecture|Imperial Roman architecture]]. The Romanesque style in England is traditionally referred to as [[Norman architecture]].

Combining features of [[Ancient Roman architecture|ancient Roman]] and [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] buildings and other local traditions, Romanesque architecture is known by its massive quality, thick walls, round arches, sturdy [[Pier (architecture)|pillars]], [[barrel vault]]s, large towers and decorative [[Arcade (architecture)|arcading]]. Each building has clearly defined forms, frequently of very regular, [[symmetrical]] plan; the overall appearance is one of simplicity when compared with the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] buildings that were to follow. The style can be identified right across Europe, despite regional characteristics and different materials.

Many [[castle]]s were built during this period, but they are greatly outnumbered by churches. The most significant are the great [[abbey]] churches, many of which are still standing, more or less complete and frequently in use.&lt;ref name=BF&gt;Bannister Fletcher, ''A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''.&lt;/ref&gt; The enormous quantity of churches built in the Romanesque period was succeeded by the still busier period of Gothic architecture, which partly or entirely rebuilt most Romanesque churches in prosperous areas like England and Portugal. The largest groups of Romanesque survivors are in areas that were less prosperous in subsequent periods, including parts of [[southern France]], rural Spain and rural Italy. Survivals of unfortified [[Romanesque secular and domestic architecture|Romanesque secular]] houses and palaces, and the domestic quarters of monasteries are far rarer, but these used and adapted the features found in church buildings, on a domestic scale.

==Definition==
According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the word "Romanesque" means "descended from Roman" and was first used in English to designate what are now called [[Romance languages]] (first cited 1715). The French term "{{lang|fr|romane}}" was first used in the architectural sense by archaeologist [[Charles-Alexis-Adrien Duhérissier de Gerville|Charles de Gerville]] in a letter of 18 December 1818 to [[Auguste Le Prévost]] to describe what Gerville sees as a ''debased Roman architecture''.{{#tag:ref|Gerville (1818): {{lang-fr|Je vous ai quelquefois parlé d'architecture romane. C’est un mot de ma façon qui me paraît heureusement inventé pour remplacer les mots insignifiants de saxone et de normande. Tout le monde convient que cette architecture, lourde et grossière, est l'opus romanum dénaturé ou successivement dégradé par nos rudes ancêtres. Alors aussi, de la langue latine, également estropiée, se faisait cette langue romane dont l'origine et la dégradation ont tant d'analogie avec l'origine et les progrès de l'architecture. Dites-moi donc, je vous prie, que mon nom romane est heureusement trouvé.}} (I have sometimes spoken to you about Romanesque architecture.

The term is now used for the more restricted period from the late 10th to 12th centuries. The term "[[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-romanesque]]" is sometimes applied to architecture in Germany of the [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian architecture|Ottonian]] periods and [[Visigothic art and architecture#Visigothic architecture|Visigothic]], [[Mozarabic art and architecture#Architecture|Mozarab]] and [[Asturian architecture|Asturian]] constructions between the 8th and the 10th centuries in the Iberian Peninsula while "[[First Romanesque]]" is applied to buildings in north of Italy and Spain and parts of France that have Romanesque features but pre-date the influence of the [[Abbey of Cluny]].

==Scope==
{{See also|Romanesque secular and domestic architecture}}
Buildings of every type were constructed in the Romanesque style, with evidence remaining of simple domestic buildings, elegant town houses, grand palaces, commercial premises, civic buildings, castles, city walls, bridges, village churches, abbey churches, abbey complexes and large cathedrals.&lt;ref name=Romanesque&gt;Rolf Toman, ''Romanesque: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting''&lt;/ref&gt; Of these types of buildings, domestic and commercial buildings are the most rare, with only a handful of survivors in the United Kingdom, several clusters in France, isolated buildings across Europe and by far the largest number, often unidentified and altered over the centuries, in Italy. Many castles exist, the foundations of which date from the Romanesque period. Most have been substantially altered, and many are in ruins.

By far the greatest number of surviving Romanesque buildings are churches. These range from tiny [[chapel]]s to large [[cathedral]]s. Although many have been extended and altered in different styles, a large number remain either substantially intact or sympathetically restored, demonstrating the form, character and decoration of Romanesque church architecture.&lt;ref name=Romanesque/&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Pre-Romanesque art and architecture}}

===Origins===
Romanesque architecture was the first distinctive style to spread across Europe since the [[Roman Empire]]. With the decline of Rome, [[Roman architecture|Roman building methods]] survived to an extent in Western Europe, where successive [[Merovingian art and architecture|Merovingian]], [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian architecture|Ottonian]] architects continued to build large stone buildings such as monastery churches and palaces. In the more northern countries, Roman building styles and techniques had never been adopted except for official buildings, while in Scandinavia they were unknown. Although the round arch continued in use, the engineering skills required to vault large spaces and build large domes were lost. There was a loss of stylistic continuity, particularly apparent in the decline of the formal vocabulary of the [[Architectural orders|Classical Orders]]. In Rome several great [[Constantine I|Constantinian]] [[basilica]]s continued in use as an inspiration to later builders. Some traditions of Roman architecture also survived in [[Byzantine architecture]] with the 6th-century octagonal Byzantine [[Basilica of San Vitale]] in [[Ravenna]] being the inspiration for the greatest building of the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] in Europe, the [[Emperor Charlemagne]]'s [[Palatine Chapel, Aachen]], Germany, built around the year AD 800.&lt;ref name=HG&gt;Helen Gardner, ''Art through the Ages''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dating shortly after the Palatine Chapel is a remarkable 9th-century Swiss manuscript known as the [[Plan of Saint Gall]] and showing a very detailed plan of a monastic complex, with all its various monastic buildings and their functions labelled. The largest building is the church, the plan of which is distinctly Germanic, having an apse at both ends, an arrangement not generally seen elsewhere. Another feature of the church is its regular proportion, the square plan of the crossing tower providing a module for the rest of the plan. These features can both be seen at the Proto-Romanesque [[St. Michael's Church, Hildesheim]], 1001–1030.&lt;ref name=HG/&gt;

Architecture of a Romanesque style also developed simultaneously in the north of Italy, parts of France and in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the 10th century and prior to the later influence of the [[Abbey of Cluny]]. The style, sometimes called [[First Romanesque]] or [[Lombard architecture|Lombard Romanesque]], is characterised by thick walls, lack of sculpture and the presence of rhythmic ornamental arches known as a [[Lombard band]].

===Politics===
[[Charlemagne]] was crowned by the Pope in [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] on Christmas Day in the year 800, with an aim to re-establishing the old [[Roman Empire]]. Charlemagne's political successors continued to rule much of Europe, with a gradual emergence of the separate political states that were eventually to become welded into nations, either by allegiance or defeat, the [[Kingdom of Germany]] giving rise to the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The invasion of England by [[William, Duke of Normandy]], in 1066, saw the building of both castles and churches that reinforced the Norman presence. Several significant churches that were built at this time were founded by rulers as seats of temporal and religious power, or places of [[coronation]] and burial. These include the [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbaye-Saint-Denis]], [[Speyer Cathedral]] and [[Westminster Abbey]] (where little of the Norman church now remains).

At a time when the remaining architectural structures of the [[Roman Empire]] were falling into decay and much of its learning and technology lost, the building of masonry domes and the carving of decorative architectural details continued unabated, though greatly evolved in style since the fall of Rome, in the enduring [[Byzantine Empire]]. The domed churches of [[Constantinople]] and Eastern Europe were to greatly affect the architecture of certain towns, particularly through trade and through the [[Crusades]]. The most notable single building that demonstrates this is [[St Mark's Basilica]], [[Venice]], but there are many lesser-known examples, particularly in France, such as the church of [[Périgueux Cathedral|Saint-Front]], [[Périgueux]] and [[Angoulême Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=OME&gt;George Holmes, ed. ''The Oxford History of Medieval Europe''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Europe was affected by [[feudalism]] in which peasants held tenure from local rulers over the land that they farmed in exchange for [[military service]]. The result of this was that they could be called upon, not only for local and regional spats, but to follow their lord to travel across Europe to the Crusades, if they were required to do so. The [[Crusades]], 1095–1270, brought about a very large movement of people and, with them, ideas and trade skills, particularly those involved in the building of fortifications and the metal working needed for the provision of arms, which was also applied to the fitting and decoration of buildings. The continual movement of people, rulers, nobles, bishops, abbots, craftsmen and peasants, was an important factor in creating a homogeneity in building methods and a recognizable ''Romanesque style'', despite regional differences.

Life became generally less secure after the Carolingian period. This resulted in the building of castles at strategic points, many of them being constructed as strongholds of the Normans, descendants of the Vikings who invaded northern France under [[Rollo]] in 911. Political struggles also resulted in the fortification of many towns, or the rebuilding and strengthening of walls that remained from the Roman period. One of the most notable surviving fortifications is that of the city of [[Carcassonne]]. The enclosure of towns brought about a lack of living space within the walls, and resulted in a style of town house that was tall and narrow, often surrounding communal courtyards, as at [[San Gimignano]] in [[Tuscany]].&lt;ref name=Toman1&gt;Rolf Toman, pp. 114-117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copplestone, pp.188-89&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s built a number of residences, fortified, but essentially palaces rather than castles, at strategic points and on trade routes. The [[Imperial Palace of Goslar]] (heavily restored in the 19th century) was built in the early 11th century by Otto III and Henry III, while the ruined Palace at [[Gelnhausen]] was received by Frederick Barbarossa prior to 1170.&lt;ref name=Toman2&gt;Rolf Toman, pp. 70-73&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of people and armies also brought about the building of bridges, some of which have survived, including the 12th-century bridge at [[Besalú]], [[Catalonia]], the 11th-century Puente de la Reina, [[Navarre]] and the Pont-Saint-Bénézet, [[Avignon]].&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Toman, pp. 18, 177, 188&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Across Europe, the late 11th and 12th centuries saw an unprecedented growth in the number of churches.&lt;ref&gt;"In the years that followed the year 1000, we witnessed the rebuilding of churches all over the universe, but especially in Italy and Gaul." Chronicle of Raoul Glaber, quoted by Jean Hubert, ''Romanesque Art''.&lt;/ref&gt; A great number of these buildings, both large and small, remain, some almost intact and in others altered almost beyond recognition in later centuries. They include many very well known churches such as [[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]] in Rome,&lt;ref&gt;famous for the ancient Roman "Mouth of Truth" set into the wall of its narthex&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Florence Baptistry|Baptistery in Florence]]&lt;ref&gt;famous for the 15th-century Ghiberti Doors&lt;/ref&gt; and San Zeno Maggiore in Verona.&lt;ref&gt;traditionally the marriage place of [[Romeo and Juliet]]&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the famous abbeys of Aux Dames and Les Hommes at Caen and [[Mont Saint-Michel]] date from this period, as well as the abbeys of the pilgrimage route to [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral|Santiago de Compostela]]. Many cathedrals owe their foundation to this date, with others beginning as abbey churches, and later becoming cathedrals. In England, of the cathedrals of ancient foundation, all were begun in this period with the exception of Salisbury, where the monks relocated from the Norman church at [[Old Sarum]], and several, such as [[Canterbury]], which were rebuilt on the site of Saxon churches.&lt;ref name=JH&gt;John Harvey, ''English Cathedrals''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ACT&gt;Alec Clifton-Taylor, ''The Cathedrals of England''&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, the most famous church of the period is [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral|Santiago de Compostela]]. In Germany, the Rhine and its tributaries were the location of many Romanesque abbeys, notably [[Mainz Cathedral|Mainz]], [[Worms Cathedral|Worms]], [[Speyer Cathedral|Speyer]] and [[Bamberg Cathedral|Bamberg]]. In [[Cologne]], then the largest city north of the Alps, a very important [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|group of large city churches]] survives largely intact. As monasticism spread across Europe, Romanesque churches sprang up in Scotland, Scandinavia, Poland, Hungary, Sicily, Serbia and Tunisia. Several important Romanesque churches were built in the [[Crusader kingdom]]s.&lt;ref name=Toman&gt;Rolf Toman, ''Romanesque''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Monasticism====
The system of monasticism in which the religious become members of an order, with common ties and a common rule, living in a mutually dependent community, rather than as a group of hermits living in proximity but essentially separate, was established by the monk [[Benedict of Nursia|Benedict]] in the 6th century. The [[Benedictines|Benedictine]] monasteries spread from Italy throughout Europe, being always by far the most numerous in England. They were followed by the [[Cluniacs|Cluniac]] order, the [[Cistercians]], [[Carthusian]]s and [[Augustinian Canons]]. During the [[Crusades]], the military orders of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] and the [[Knights Templar]] were founded.

The monasteries, which sometimes also functioned as cathedrals, and the cathedrals that had bodies of secular clergy often living in community, were a major source of power in Europe. Bishops and the abbots of important monasteries lived and functioned like princes. The monasteries were the major seats of learning of all sorts. Benedict had ordered that all the arts were to be taught and practiced in the monasteries. Within the monasteries books were transcribed by hand, and few people outside the monasteries could read or write.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;

In France, Burgundy was the centre of monasticism. The enormous and powerful monastery at [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] was to have lasting effect on the layout of other monasteries and the design of their churches. Unfortunately, very little of the abbey church at Cluny remains; the "Cluny II" rebuilding of 963 onwards has completely vanished, but we have a good idea of the design of "Cluny III" from 1088 to 1130, which until the Renaissance remained the largest building in Europe. However, the church of [[Basilica of St. Sernin, Toulouse|St. Sernin]] at [[Toulouse]], 1080–1120, has remained intact and demonstrates the regularity of Romanesque design with its modular form, its massive appearance and the repetition of the simple arched window motif.&lt;ref name=HG/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Pilgrimage and Crusade====
One of the effects of the [[Crusades]], which were intended to wrest the Holy Places of Palestine from [[Islam]]ic control, was to excite a great deal of religious fervour, which in turn inspired great building programs. The Nobility of Europe, upon safe return, thanked [[God]] by the building of a new church or the enhancement of an old one. Likewise, those who did not return from the Crusades could be suitably commemorated by their family in a work of stone and mortar.

The Crusades resulted in the transfer of, among other things, a great number of [[Relic|Holy Relics]] of [[saint]]s and [[apostles]]. Many churches, like [[Périgueux|Saint-Front, Périgueux]], had their own home grown saint while others, most notably [[Santiago de Compostela]], claimed the remains and the patronage of a powerful saint, in this case one of the [[Twelve Apostles]]. [[Santiago de Compostela]], located near [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (present day Spain) became one of the most important pilgrimage destinations in Europe. Most of the pilgrims travelled the [[Way of St. James]] on foot, many of them barefooted as a sign of penance. They moved along one of the four main routes that passed through France, congregating for the journey at [[Jumièges]], Paris, [[Vézelay]], [[Cluny]], [[Arles]] and [[St. Gall]] in Switzerland. They crossed two passes in the [[Pyrenees]] and converged into a single stream to traverse north-western Spain. Along the route they were urged on by those pilgrims returning from the journey. On each of the routes abbeys such as those at [[Moissac]], [[Toulouse]], [[Roncesvalles]], [[Conques]], [[Limoges]] and [[Burgos]] catered for the flow of people and grew wealthy from the passing trade. [[Saint-Benoît-du-Sault]], in the Berry province, is typical of the churches that were founded on the pilgrim route.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref Name=HG/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Characteristics==
{{See also|List of regional characteristics of Romanesque churches}}
The general impression given by Romanesque architecture, in both ecclesiastical and secular buildings, is one of massive solidity and strength. In contrast with both the preceding [[Roman architecture|Roman]] and later [[Gothic architecture]], in which the load-bearing structural members are, or appear to be, columns, pilasters and arches, Romanesque architecture, in common with [[Byzantine architecture]], relies upon its walls, or sections of walls called piers.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

Romanesque architecture is often divided into two periods known as the "[[First Romanesque]]" style and the "Romanesque" style. The difference is chiefly a matter of the expertise with which the buildings were constructed. The First Romanesque employed rubble walls, smaller windows and unvaulted roofs. A greater refinement marks the Second Romanesque, along with increased use of the vault and dressed stone.

===Walls===
The walls of Romanesque buildings are often of massive thickness with few and comparatively small openings. They are often double shells, filled with rubble.

The building material differs greatly across Europe, depending upon the local stone and building traditions. In Italy, Poland, much of Germany and parts of the Netherlands, brick is generally used. Other areas saw extensive use of limestone, granite and flint. The building stone was often used in comparatively small and irregular pieces, bedded in thick mortar. Smooth [[ashlar]] masonry was not a distinguishing feature of the style, particularly in the earlier part of the period, but occurred chiefly where easily worked limestone was available.&lt;ref name=RH&gt;Rene Hyughe, ''Larousse Encyclopedia of Byzantine and Medieval Art&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buttresses===
Because of the massive nature of Romanesque walls, [[buttress]]es are not a highly significant feature, as they are in Gothic architecture. Romanesque buttresses are generally of flat square profile and do not project a great deal beyond the wall. In the case of aisled churches, barrel vaults, or half-barrel vaults over the aisles helped to buttress the nave, if it was vaulted.

In the cases where half-barrel vaults were used, they effectively became like [[flying buttress]]es. Often aisles extended through two storeys, rather than the one usual in Gothic architecture, so as to better support the weight of a vaulted nave. In the case of Durham Cathedral, flying buttresses have been employed, but are hidden inside the triforium gallery.&lt;ref name=ACT/&gt;

The rest of the building is a conglomeration of styles in ancient brick, modern brick, ashlar and flint.|[[St Albans Cathedral]] England, demonstrates the typical alterations made to the fabric of many Romanesque buildings in different styles and materials
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Arches and openings===
The arches used in Romanesque architecture are nearly always semicircular, for openings such as doors and windows, for [[vault (architecture)|vaults]] and for arcades. Wide doorways are usually surmounted by a semi-circular arch, except where a door with a [[Lintel (architecture)|lintel]] is set into a large arched recess and surmounted by a semi-circular "lunette" with decorative carving.&lt;ref name=HG/&gt; These doors sometimes have a carved central jamb.

Narrow doors and small windows might be surmounted by a solid stone lintel. Larger openings are nearly always arched. A characteristic feature of Romanesque architecture, both ecclesiastic and domestic, is the pairing of two arched windows or arcade openings, separated by a pillar or colonette and often set within a larger arch. Ocular windows are common in Italy, particularly in the facade gable and are also seen in Germany. Later Romanesque [[church architecture|churches]] may have wheel windows or [[rose window]]s with [[plate tracery]].

There are a very small number of buildings in the Romanesque style, such as [[Autun Cathedral]] in France and [[Monreale Cathedral]] in Sicily in which pointed arches have been used extensively, apparently for stylistic reasons. It is believed that in these cases there is a direct imitation of [[Islamic architecture]]. At other late Romanesque churches such as [[Durham Cathedral]], and [[Cefalù Cathedral]], the pointed arch was introduced as a structural device in ribbed vaulting. Its increasing application was fundamental to the development of [[Gothic architecture]].

===Arcades===
An arcade is a row of arches, supported on piers or columns. They occur in the interior of large churches, separating the nave from the aisles, and in large secular interiors spaces, such as the great hall of a castle, supporting the timbers of a roof or upper floor. Arcades also occur in cloisters and atriums, enclosing an open space.

Arcades can occur in storeys or stages. While the arcade of a cloister is typically of a single stage, the arcade that divides the nave and aisles in a church is typically of two stages, with a third stage of window openings known as the [[clerestory]] rising above them. Arcading on a large scale generally fulfils a structural purpose, but it is also used, generally on a smaller scale, as a decorative feature, both internally and externally where it is frequently "[[Blind arcade|blind arcading]]" with only a wall or a narrow passage behind it.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Piers===
In Romanesque architecture, [[Pier (architecture)|pier]]s were often employed to support arches. They were built of masonry and square or rectangular in section, generally having a horizontal moulding representing a capital at the springing of the arch. Sometimes piers have vertical shafts attached to them, and may also have horizontal mouldings at the level of the base.

Although basically rectangular, piers can often be of highly complex form, with half-segments of large hollow-core columns on the inner surface supporting the arch, or a clustered group of smaller shafts leading into the mouldings of the arch.

Piers that occur at the intersection of two large arches, such as those under the crossing of the nave and transept, are commonly cruciform in shape, each arch having its own supporting rectangular pier at right angles to the other.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref name=HG/&gt;

===Columns===
Columns are an important structural feature of Romanesque architecture. Colonnettes and attached shafts are also used structurally and for decoration. Monolithic columns cut from a single piece of stone were frequently used in Italy, as they had been in Roman and Early Christian architecture.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt; They were also used, particularly in Germany, when they alternated between more massive piers.&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt; Arcades of columns cut from single pieces are also common in structures that do not bear massive weights of masonry, such as cloisters, where they are sometimes paired.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;

====Salvaged columns====
In Italy, during this period, a great number of antique Roman columns were salvaged and reused in the interiors and on the porticos of churches. The most durable of these columns are of marble and have the stone horizontally bedded. The majority are vertically bedded and are sometimes of a variety of colours. They may have retained their original Roman capitals, generally of the [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] or [[Composite order|Roman Composite]] style.&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt;
Some buildings, like [[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]] &lt;small&gt;(illustrated above)&lt;/small&gt; and the atrium at [[Basilica di San Clemente|San Clemente]] in Rome, may have an odd assortment of columns in which large capitals are placed on short columns and small capitals are placed on taller columns to even the height. Architectural compromises of this type are seen where materials have been salvaged from a number of buildings. Salvaged columns were also used to a lesser extent in France.

====Drum columns====
In most parts of Europe, Romanesque columns were massive, as they supported thick upper walls with small windows, and sometimes heavy vaults. The most common method of construction was to build them out of stone cylinders called drums, as in the crypt at [[Speyer Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This technique was also used in the Classical world, notably at the [[Parthenon]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hollow core columns====
Where really massive columns were called for, such as those at [[Durham Cathedral]], they were constructed of ashlar masonry and the hollow core was filled with rubble. These huge untapered columns are sometimes ornamented with incised decorations.&lt;ref name=ACT/&gt;

====Alternation====
A common characteristic of Romanesque buildings, occurring both in churches and in the arcades that separate large interior spaces of castles, is the alternation of piers and columns.

The most simple form that this takes is to have a column between each adjoining pier. Sometimes the columns are in multiples of two or three. At [[St. Michael's, Hildesheim]], an A B B A alternation occurs in the nave while an A B A alternation can be seen in the transepts.

At [[Jumièges]] there are tall drum columns between piers each of which has a half-column supporting the arch. There are many variations on this theme, most notably at [[Durham Cathedral]] where the mouldings and shafts of the piers are of exceptional richness and the huge masonry columns are deeply incised with geometric patterns.&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt;

Often the arrangement was made more complex by the complexity of the piers themselves, so that it was not piers and columns that alternated, but rather, piers of entirely different form from each other, such as those of [[Sant' Ambrogio, Milan]], where the nature of the vault dictated that the alternate piers bore a great deal more weight than the intermediate ones and are thus very much larger.&lt;ref name=HG/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Capitals====
The foliate [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] style provided the inspiration for many Romanesque capitals, and the accuracy with which they were carved depended very much on the availability of original models, those in Italian churches such as [[Pisa Cathedral]] or church of [[Sant'Alessandro, Lucca|Sant'Alessandro in Lucca]] and southern France being much closer to the Classical than those in England.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt;

The Corinthian capital is essentially round at the bottom where it sits on a circular column and square at the top, where it supports the wall or arch. This form of capital was maintained in the general proportions and outline of the Romanesque capital. This was achieved most simply by cutting a rectangular cube and taking the four lower corners off at an angle so that the block was square at the top, but octagonal at the bottom, as can be seen at St. Michael's Hildesheim.&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt;
This shape lent itself to a wide variety of superficial treatments, sometimes foliate in imitation of the source, but often figurative. In Northern Europe the foliate capitals generally bear far more resemblance to the intricacies of [[manuscript illumination]] than to Classical sources. In parts of France and Italy there are strong links to the pierced capitals of [[Byzantine architecture]]. It is in the figurative capitals that the greatest originality is shown. While some are dependent on manuscripts illustrations of Biblical scenes and depictions of beasts and monsters, others are lively scenes of the legends of local saints.&lt;ref name=OME/&gt;

The capitals, while retaining the form of a square top and a round bottom, were often compressed into little more than a bulging cushion-shape. This is particularly the case on large masonry columns, or on large columns that alternate with piers as at Durham.&lt;small&gt;(See illustrated above)&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Vaults and roofs===
The majority of buildings have wooden roofs, generally of a simple ''truss'', ''tie beam'' or ''king post'' form. In the case of trussed rafter roofs, they are sometimes lined with wooden ceilings in three sections like those that survive at [[Ely Cathedral|Ely]] and [[Peterborough Cathedral|Peterborough]] cathedrals in England. In churches, typically the aisles are vaulted, but the nave is roofed with timber, as is the case at both Peterborough and Ely.&lt;ref name=ACT/&gt; In Italy where open wooden roofs are common, and tie beams frequently occur in conjunction with vaults, the timbers have often been decorated as at [[San Miniato al Monte]], Florence.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;

Vaults of stone or brick took on several different forms and showed marked development during the period, evolving into the pointed ribbed arch characteristic of [[Gothic architecture]].

====Barrel vault====
The simplest type of vaulted roof is the [[barrel vault]] in which a single arched surface extends from wall to wall, the length of the space to be vaulted, for example, the nave of a church. An important example, which retains Medieval paintings, is the vault of [[Abbey Church of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe|Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe]], France, of the early 12th century. However, the barrel vault generally required the support of solid walls, or walls in which the windows were very small.&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt;

====Groin vault====
[[Groin vault]]s occur in early Romanesque buildings, notably at [[Speyer Cathedral]] where the high vault of about 1060 is the first employment in Romanesque architecture of this type of vault for a wide nave.&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt; In later buildings employing ribbed vaultings, groin vaults are most frequently used for the less visible and smaller vaults, particularly in crypts and aisles. A groin vault is almost always square in plan and is constructed of two barrel vaults intersecting at right angles. Unlike a ribbed vault, the entire arch is a structural member. Groin vaults are frequently separated by transverse arched ribs of low profile as at Speyer and [[Santiago de Compostela]]. At [[Vézelay Abbey|Sainte Marie Madeleine, Vézelay]], the ribs are square in section, strongly projecting and polychrome.&lt;ref name=NP&gt;Nikolaus Pevsner, ''An Outline of European Architecture''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ribbed vault====
[[Ribbed vault]]s came into general use in the 12th century. In ribbed vaults, not only are there ribs spanning the vaulted area transversely, but each vaulted bay has diagonal ribs, following the same course as the groins in a groin vault. However, whereas in a groin vault, the vault itself is the structural member, in a ribbed vault, it is the ribs that are the structural members, and the spaces between them can be filled with lighter, non-structural material.&lt;ref name =BF307&gt;Banister Fletcher, p.307&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Romanesque arches are nearly always semi-circular, the structural and design problem inherent in the ribbed vault is that the diagonal span is larger and therefore higher than the transverse span.&lt;ref name=BF307/&gt; The Romanesque builders used a number of solutions to this problem. One was to have the centre point where the diagonal ribs met as the highest point, with the infill of all the surfaces sloping upwards towards it, in a domical manner. This solution was employed in Italy at [[San Michele, Pavia]], and [[Sant' Ambrogio, Milan]].&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt;

The solution employed in England was to stilt the transverse ribs, maintaining a horizontal central line to the roof like that of a barrel vault.&lt;ref name=BF307/&gt; The diagonal ribs could also be depressed, a solution used on the sexpartite vaults at both the Saint-Étienne, ([[Abbaye-aux-Hommes]]) and Sainte-Trinité, ([[Église de la Ste.-Trinité, Caen|Abbaye-les-Dames]]) at Caen, France, in the late 11th and early 12th centuries.&lt;ref name=BF307/&gt;

====Pointed arched vault====
The problems encountered in the structure and appearance of vaults was solved late in the Romanesque period with the introduction of pointed arched ribs which allowed the height of both diagonal and transverse ribs to be varied in proportion to each other.&lt;ref name=BF307/&gt; Pointed ribs made their first appearance in the transverse ribs of the vaults at [[Durham Cathedral]] in northern England, dating from 1128. Durham is a cathedral of massive Romanesque proportions and appearance, yet its builders introduced several structural features that were new to architectural design and were later to be hallmark features of the Gothic. Another Gothic structural feature employed at Durham is the [[flying buttress]]. However, these are hidden beneath the roofs of the aisles.
The earliest pointed vault in France is that of the narthex of [[Vézelay Abbey|La Madeleine, Vézelay]], dating from 1130.&lt;ref name=RH/&gt; They were subsequently employed with the development of the Gothic style at the east end of the [[Basilica of St Denis]] in Paris in 1140.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt; An early ribbed vault in the Romanesque architecture of Sicily is that of the chancel at the [[Cathedral of Cefalù]].

====Domes====
{{see also|History of Medieval Arabic and Western European domes#Holy Roman Empire}}
Domes in Romanesque architecture are generally found within [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing tower]]s at the intersection of a church's [[nave]] and [[transept]], which conceal the domes externally.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=172}} Called a ''tiburio'', this tower-like structure often has a blind arcade near the roof.{{sfn|Jones|Murray|Murray|2013|p=512}} Romanesque domes are typically octagonal in plan and use corner squinches to translate a square bay into a suitable octagonal base.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt; Octagonal cloister vaults appear "in connection with basilicas almost throughout Europe" between 1050 and 1100.{{sfn|Porter|1928|p=48}} The precise form differs from region to region.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=172}}

==Ecclesiastical architecture==
{{See also|List of regional characteristics of Romanesque churches}}

===Plan===
Many parish churches, abbey churches and cathedrals are in the Romanesque style, or were originally built in the Romanesque style and have subsequently undergone changes.
The simplest Romanesque churches are aisleless halls with a projecting apse at the chancel end, or sometimes, particularly in England, a projecting rectangular chancel with a chancel arch that might be decorated with mouldings. More ambitious churches have aisles separated from the nave by arcades.

Abbey and cathedral churches generally follow the [[Latin Cross]] plan. In England, the extension eastward may be long, while in Italy it is often short or non-existent, the church being of T plan, sometimes with apses on the transept ends as well as to the east. In France the church of St Front, Périgueux, appears to have been modelled on [[St. Mark's Basilica, Venice]], or the Byzantine [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] and is of a [[Greek cross]] plan with five domes.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, F., &amp; Edgell, G. H. (1918). A History of Architecture. New York. Harper &amp; Brothers. 621 pages (page 252).&lt;/ref&gt; In the same region, [[Angoulême Cathedral]] is an aisleless church of the Latin cross plan, more usual in France, but is also roofed with domes.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt;
In Germany, Romanesque churches are often of distinctive form, having apses at both east and west ends, the main entrance being central to one side. It is probable that this form came about to accommodate a baptistery at the west end.&lt;ref name=RH/&gt;

NOTE: The plans below do not show the buildings in their current states.&lt;ref&gt;With the exception of the [[Plan of St. Gall]], which is from an ancient manuscript (and probably does not reflect an actual construction), they are all hypothetical reconstructions of groundplans as they existed in the 12th or 13th centuries. The Abbey Church of St. Gall has been replaced by a Baroque Church. Speyer has had its west front rebuilt twice, Ely Cathedral has lost the eastern arm, being replaced in the Gothic style, the central tower being replaced with the unique octagon and the northwest tower, never rebuilt. It has also gained a west porch. Santiago has had some substantial changes including a Baroque west front.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The [[Abbey of St. Gall|Abbey Church of St. Gall]], Switzerland, shows the plan that was to become common throughout Germanic Europe. It is a [[Latin Cross]] with a comparatively long nave and short transepts and eastern end, which is apsidal. The nave is aisled, but the chancel and transepts are not. It has an apsidal west end, which was to become a feature of Churches of Germany, such as [[Worms Cathedral]]. [[Speyer Cathedral]], Germany, also has aisleless transept and chancel. It has a markedly modular look. A typical Germanic characteristic is the presence of towers framing the chancel and the west end. There is marked emphasis on the western entrance, called ''Westwerk'', which is seen in several other churches. Each vault compartment covers two narrow bays of the nave

At [[Autun Cathedral]], France, the pattern of the nave bays and aisles extends beyond the crossing and into the chancel, each aisle terminating in an apse. Each nave bay is separated at the vault by a transverse rib. Each transept projects to the width of two nave bays. The entrance has a narthex which screens the main portal. This type of entrance was to be elaborated in the Gothic period on the transepts at Chartres. [[Angoulême Cathedral]], France, is one of several instances in which the Byzantine churches of Constantinople seem to have been influential in the design in which the main spaces are roofed by domes. This structure has necessitated the use of very thick walls, and massive piers from which the domes spring. There are radiating chapels around the apse, which is a typically French feature and was to evolve into the [[chevet]].

As was typically the case in England, [[Ely Cathedral]] was a Benedictine monastery, serving both monastic and secular function. To facilitate this, the chancel or "presbytery" is longer than usually found in Europe, as are the aisled transepts which contained chapels. In England, emphasis was placed on the orientation of the chapels to the east. The very large piers at the crossing signify that there was once a tower. The western end having two round towers flanking a tall central tower was unique in Britain. Ely Cathedral was never vaulted and retains a wooden ceiling over the nave.

[[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral|The cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]] shares many features with Ely, but is typically Spanish in its expansive appearance. Santiago held the body of St. James and was the most significant pilgrimage site in Europe. The narthex, the aisles, the large aisled transepts and numerous projecting chapels reflect this. The chancel is short, compared to that of Ely, and the altar set so as to provide clear view to a vast congregation simultaneously.

[[Modena Cathedral]] shows a typically Italian Romanesque plan, often architecturally termed a "[[basilica]]", because of its similarity in plan to a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] basilicas.

===Section===
In section, the typical aisled church or cathedral has a nave with a single aisle on either side. The nave and aisles are separated by an arcade carried on piers or on columns. The roof of the aisle and the outer walls help to buttress the upper walls and vault of the nave, if present. Above the aisle roof are a row of windows known as the clerestory, which give light to the nave. During the Romanesque period there was a development from this two-stage elevation to a three-stage elevation in which there is a gallery, known as a ''[[triforium]]'', between the arcade and the clerestory. This varies from a simple blind arcade decorating the walls, to a narrow arcaded passage, to a fully developed second story with a row of windows lighting the gallery.&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Church and cathedral east ends===
The eastern end of a Romanesque church is almost always semi-circular, with either a high chancel surrounded by an ambulatory as in France, or a square end from which an apse projects as in Germany and Italy. Where square ends exist in English churches, they are probably influenced by [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Anglo Saxon]] churches. Peterborough and Norwich Cathedrals have retained round east ends in the French style. However, in France, simple churches without apses and with no decorative features were built by the [[Cistercians]] who also founded many houses in England, frequently in remote areas.&lt;ref name=FHC&gt;{{cite book |first=Frederick H. |last=Crossley |year=1962 |title=The English Abbey |location= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Church and cathedral façades and external decoration===
Romanesque church facades, generally to the west end of the building, are usually symmetrical, have a large central portal made significant by its mouldings or porch, and an arrangement of arched-topped windows. In Italy there is often a single central ocular or wheel window.&lt;ref name=BF309/&gt; The common decorative feature is arcading.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;

Smaller churches often have a single tower that is usually placed to the western end in France or England, either centrally or to one side, while larger churches and cathedrals often have two.

In France, [[Abbaye-aux-Hommes|Saint-Étienne, Caen]], presents the model of a large French Romanesque facade. It is a symmetrical arrangement of nave flanked by two tall towers each with two buttresses of low flat profile that divide the facade into three vertical units. The lowest stage is marked by large doors, each set within an arch in each of the three vertical sections. The wider central section has two tiers of three identical windows, while in the outer sections there are two tiers of single windows, giving emphasis to the mass of the towers. The towers rise above the facade through three further tiers, the lowest of tall blind arcading, the next of arcading pierced by two narrow windows and the third of two large windows, divided into two lights by a colonnette.&lt;ref name=NP/&gt;

This facade can be seen as the foundation for many other buildings, including both French and English Gothic churches. While the form is typical of northern France, its various components were common to many Romanesque churches of the period across Europe. Similar facades are found in Portugal. In England, [[Southwell Cathedral]] has maintained this form, despite the insertion of a huge Gothic window between the towers. [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]] and [[Durham Cathedral|Durham]] must once have looked like this. In Germany, [[Limburg Cathedral]] has a rich variety of openings and arcades in horizontal storeys of varying heights.

The churches of [[San Zeno Maggiore, Verona]], and [[San Michele, Pavia]], present two types of facade that are typical of Italian Romanesque, that which reveals the architectural form of the building, and that which screens it. At San Zeno, the components of nave and aisles are made clear by the vertical shafts that rise to the level of the central gable and by the varying roof levels. At [[San Miniato al Monte]] the definition of the architectural parts is made even clearer by the [[polychrome]] marble, a feature of many Italian Medieval facades, particularly in Tuscany.
At San Michele the vertical definition is present as at San Zeno, but the rooflines are screened behind a single large gable decorated with stepped arcading. At [[Santa Maria della Pieve]], [[Arezzo]], this screening is carried even further, as the roofline is horizontal and the arcading rises in many different levels while the colonettes that support them have a great diversity of decoration.&lt;ref name=HG/&gt;&lt;ref name=RH/&gt;

In the [[Rhineland]] and Netherlands the Carolingian form of west end known as the [[westwerk]] prevailed. Towers and apse of the western end are often incorporated into a multi-storey structure that bears little structural or visual relationship to the building behind it. These westwerks take a great variety of forms as may be seen at [[Maria Laach Abbey]], [[Collegiate Church of Saint Gertrude, Nivelles|St Gertrude, Nivelles]], and [[Basilica of Saint Servatius|St Serviatius]], Maastricht.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Church towers===
Towers were an important feature of Romanesque churches and a great number of them are still standing. They take a variety of forms: square, circular and octagonal, and are positioned differently in relation to the church building in different countries. In northern France, two large towers, such as those at Caen, were to become an integral part of the facade of any large abbey or cathedral. In central and southern France this is more variable and large churches may have one tower or a central tower. Large churches of [[Romanesque architecture in Spain|Spain]] and [[Portuguese Romanesque architecture|Portugal]] usually have two towers.

Many abbeys of France, such as that at Cluny, had many towers of varied forms. This is also common in Germany, where the apses were sometimes framed with circular towers and the crossing surmounted by an octagonal tower as at [[Worms Cathedral]]. Large paired towers of square plan could also occur on the transept ends, such as those at [[Tournai Cathedral]] in Belgium. In Germany, where four towers frequently occur, they often have spires that may be four or eight sided, or the distinctive ''Rhenish helm'' shape seen on the cathedrals of [[Limburger Dom|Limburg]]&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt; or [[Speyer Cathedral|Speyer]]. It is also common to see bell or onion-shaped spires of the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque period]] surmounting Romanesque towers in central and Eastern Europe.

In England, for large abbeys and cathedral buildings, three towers were favoured, with the central tower being the tallest. This was often not achieved, through the slow process of the building stages, and in many cases the upper parts of the tower were not completed until centuries later as at Durham and Lincoln. Large Norman towers exist at the cathedrals of Durham, [[Exeter Cathedral|Exeter]], [[Southwell Minster|Southwell]], [[Norwich Cathedral|Norwich]] and [[Tewkesbury Abbey]].&lt;ref name=ACT/&gt;&lt;ref name=FHC/&gt; Such towers were often topped during the late Medieval period with a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] spire of wooden construction covered with lead, copper or [[roof shingle|shingles]]. In the case of Norwich Cathedral, the huge, ornate, 12th-century crossing-tower received a 15th-century masonry spire rising to a height of 320 feet and remaining to this day.

In Italy towers are almost always free standing and the position is often dictated by the landform of the site, rather than aesthetics. This is the case in nearly all Italian churches both large and small, except in Sicily where a number of churches were founded by the Norman rulers and are more French in appearance.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;

As a general rule, large Romanesque towers are square with corner buttresses of low profile, rising without diminishing through the various stages. Towers are usually marked into clearly defined stages by horizontal courses. As the towers rise, the number and size of openings increases as can be seen on the right tower of the transept of [[Tournai Cathedral]] where two narrow slits in the fourth level from the top becomes a single window, then two windows, then three windows at the uppermost level. This sort of arrangement is particularly noticeable on the towers of Italian churches, which are usually built of brick and may have no other ornament. Two fine examples occur at [[Lucca]], at the church of [[Basilica di San Frediano|San Frediano]] and at the ''[[Lucca Cathedral|Duomo]]''. It is also seen in [[Romanesque architecture in Spain|Spain]].&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;

In Italy there are a number of large free-standing towers that are circular, the most famous of these being the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]]. In other countries where circular towers occur, such as Germany, they are usually paired and often flank an apse. Circular towers are uncommon in England, but occur throughout the Early Medieval period in Ireland.

Polygonal towers were often used on crossings and occur in France, Germany, Italy and Spain such as that of the [[Old Cathedral, Salamanca]], which is covered by a dome supported on a ribbed vault.&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt;

Smaller churches sometimes had [[bell-gable]]s instead of towers, a feature which, according to some authors, is characteristic of the simplicity of much architecture in the Romanesque style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elripolles.com/que-vols-fer/turisme-cultural/romanic/romanic-de-la-vall-de-camprodon/7.html |title=Romànic de la Vall de Camprodon |publisher=Elripolles.com |date=9 March 2010 |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Portals===
Romanesque churches generally have a single portal centrally placed on the west front, the focus of decoration for the facade of the building. Some churches such as [[Abbaye aux Hommes|Saint-Étienne]], Caen, (11th century) and [[Pisa Cathedral]] (late 12th century) had three western portals, in the manner of [[Early Christian architecture|Early Christian]] basilicas. Many churches, both large and small, had lateral entrances that were commonly used by worshippers.

Romanesque doorways have a character form, with the jambs having a series of receding planes, into each of which is set a circular shaft, all surmounted by a continuous abacus. The semi-circular arch which rises from the abacus has the same seried planes and circular mouldings as the jambs.&lt;ref name=BF309&gt;Banister Fletcher p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; There are typically four planes containing three shafts, but there may be as many as twelve shafts, symbolic of the apostles.

The opening of the portal may be arched, or may be set with a lintel supporting a tympanum, generally carved, but in Italy sometimes decorated with mosaic or fresco. A carved tympanum generally constitutes the major sculptural work of a Romanesque church. The subject of the carving on a major portal may be Christ in Majesty or the Last Judgement. Lateral doors may include other subjects such as the [[Nativity in art|Birth of Christ]]. The portal may be protected by a porch, with simple open porches being typical of Italy, and more elaborate structures typical of France and Spain.

===Interiors===
The structure of large churches differed regionally and developed across the centuries. The use of piers of rectangular plan to support arcades was common, as at Mainz Cathedral and St Gertrude Nivelle, and remained usual in smaller churches across Europe, with the arcades often taking the form of openings through the surface of a wall. In Italy, where there was a strong tradition of using marble columns, complete with capital, base and abacus, this remained prevalent, often reusing existent ancient columns, as at San Miniato al Monte. A number of 11th-century churches have naves distinguished by huge circular columns with no clerestory, or a very small one as at St Philibert, Tournus. In England stout columns of large diameter supported decorated arches, gallery and clerestory, as at the nave of Malmesbury Abbey (see "Piers and columns", above). By the early 12th century composite piers had evolved, in which the attached shafts swept upward to a ribbed vault or were continued into the mouldings of the arcade, as at Vézelay Abbey, Saint-Étienne, Caen, and Peterborough Cathedral.

The nature of the internal roofing varied greatly, from open timber roofs, and wooden ceilings of different types, which remained common in smaller churches, to simple barrel vaults and groin vaults and increasingly to the use of ribbed vaults in the late 11th and 12th centuries, which were to become a common feature of larger abbey churches and cathedrals. A number of Romanesque churches are roofed with a series of Domes. At [[Fontevrault Abbey]] the nave is covered by four domes, while at the Church of Saint Front, [[Périgueux]], the church is of [[Greek cross]] plan, with a central dome surrounded by four smaller domes over the nave, chancel and transepts.

Internal decoration varied across Europe. Where wide expanses of wall existed, they were often plastered and painted. Wooden ceilings and timber beams were decorated. In Italy walls were sometimes faced with polychrome marble. Where buildings were constructed of stone that was suitable for carving, many decorative details occur, including ornate capitals and mouldings.

The apsidal east end was often a focus of decoration, with both architectonic forms such as arcading and pictorial features such as carved figures, murals and occasionally mosaics. Stained glass came into increasing use from the 11th century. In many churches the eastern end has been rebuilt in a later style. Of England's Norman cathedrals, no eastern end remains unchanged. In France the eastern terminals of the important abbeys of Caen, Vézelay and, most significantly, the [[Basilica of St Denis]] were completely rebuilt in the Gothic style. In Germany, major reconstructions of the 19th century sought to return many Romanesque buildings to their original form. Examples of simple Romanesque apses can be seen in the images of St Gertrude, Nivelles; St Philibert, Tournus, and San Miniato al Monte.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Other structures===
Among the structures associated with church buildings are crypts, porches, chapter houses, cloisters and baptisteries.

'''[[Crypt]]s''' are often present as an underlying structure to a substantial church, and are generally a completely discrete space, but occasionally, as in some Italian churches, may be a sunken space under a raised chancel and open, via steps, to the body of the nave. Romanesque crypts have survived in many instances, such as [[Canterbury Cathedral]], when the church itself has been rebuilt.
The usual construction of a Romanesque crypt is with many short stout columns carrying groin vaults, as at [[Worcester Cathedral]].

'''[[Porch]]es''' sometimes occur as part of the original design of a facade. This is very much the case in Italy, where they are usually only one bay deep and are supported on two columns, often resting on couchant lions, as at St Zeno, Verona.&lt;small&gt;See above.&lt;/small&gt; Elsewhere, porches of various dates have been added to the facade or side entrance of existent churches and may be quite a substantial structure, with several bays of vaulting supported on an open or partially open arcade, and forming a sort of narthex as at the Church of St Maria, Laach.&lt;small&gt;See above&lt;/small&gt; In Spain, Romanesque churches often have large lateral porches, like loggias.

'''[[Chapter house]]s''' often occur adjacent to monastic or cathedral churches. Few have survived intact from the Romanesque period. Early chapter houses were rectangular in shape, with the larger ones sometimes having groin or ribbed vaults supported on columns. Later Romanesque chapter houses sometimes had an apsidal eastern end. The chapter house at Durham Cathedral is a wide space with a ribbed vault, restored as originally constructed in 1130. The circular chapter house at Worcester Cathedral, built by Bishop Wulfstan (1062–95), was the first circular chapter house in Europe and was much imitated in England.

'''[[Cloister]]s''' are generally part of any [[Romanesque secular and domestic architecture#Monastic buildings|monastic complex]] and also occur at cathedral and collegiate churches. They were essential to the communal way of life, a place for both working during daylight hours and relaxing during inclement weather. They usually abut the church building and are enclosed with windowless walls on the outside and an open arcade on the inside, looking over a courtyard or "cloister garth". They may be vaulted or have timber roofs. The arcades are often richly decorated and are home to some of the most fanciful carved capitals of the Romanesque period with those of [[Santo Domingo de Silos]] in Spain and the [[Moissac Abbey|Abbey of St Pierre]] Moissac, being examples. Many Romanesque cloisters have survived in Spain, France, Italy and Germany, along with some of their associated buildings.

'''[[Baptistery|Baptisteries]]''' often occur in Italy as a free standing structure, associated with a cathedral. They are generally octagonal or circular and domed. The interior may be arcaded on several levels as at [[Pisa Cathedral]]. Other notable Romanesque baptisteries are that at [[Parma Cathedral]] remarkable for its galleried exterior, and the polychrome [[Florence Baptistery|Baptistery of San Giovanni]] of Florence Cathedral, with vault mosaics of the 13th century including Christ in Majesty, possibly the work of the almost legendary [[Coppo di Marcovaldo]].

===Decoration===

====Architectural embellishment====
Arcading is the single most significant decorative feature of Romanesque architecture. It occurs in a variety of forms, from the [[Lombard band]], which is a row of small arches that appear to support a roofline or course, to shallow blind arcading that is often a feature of English architecture and is seen in great variety at [[Ely Cathedral]], to the open dwarf gallery, first used at [[Speyer Cathedral]] and widely adopted in Italy as seen on both [[Pisa Cathedral]] and its famous [[Leaning Tower]]. Arcades could be used to great effect, both externally and internally, as exemplified by the church of Santa Maria della Pieve, in Arezzo.&lt;ref name=RH/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Architectural sculpture====
The Romanesque period produced a profusion of sculptural ornamentation. This most frequently took a purely geometric form and was particularly applied to mouldings, both straight courses and the curved moldings of arches. In La Madeleine, Vezelay, for example, the polychrome ribs of the vault are all edged with narrow filets of pierced stone. Similar decoration occurs around the arches of the nave and along the horizontal course separating arcade and clerestory. Combined with the pierced carving of the capitals, this gives a delicacy and refinement to the interior.&lt;ref name=RH/&gt;

In England, such decoration could be discrete, as at [[Hereford Cathedral|Hereford]] and Peterborough cathedrals, or have a sense of massive energy as at Durham where the diagonal ribs of the vaults are all outlined with [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]]s, the mouldings of the nave arcade are carved with several layers of the same and the huge columns are deeply incised with a variety of geometric patterns creating an impression of directional movement. These features combine to create one of the richest and most dynamic interiors of the Romanesque period.&lt;ref&gt;Alec Clifton-Taylor says "With the Cathedral of Durham we reach the incomparable masterpiece of Romanesque architecture not only in England but anywhere."&lt;/ref&gt;

Although much sculptural ornament was sometimes applied to the interiors of churches, the focus of such decoration was generally the west front, and in particular, the portals. Chevrons and other geometric ornaments, referred to by 19th-century writers as "barbaric ornament", are most frequently found on the mouldings of the central door. Stylized foliage often appears, sometimes deeply carved and curling outward after the manner of the acanthus leaves on [[Corinthian order|Corinthian capitals]], but also carved in shallow relief and spiral patterns, imitating the intricacies of manuscript illuminations. In general, the style of ornament was more classical in Italy, such as that seen around the door of [[San Giusto, Lucca|San Giusto]] in [[Lucca]], and more "barbaric" in England, Germany and Scandinavia, such as that seen at [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]] and [[Speyer Cathedral]]s. France produced a great range of ornament, with particularly fine interwoven and spiralling vines in the "manuscript" style occurring at [[Basilique de Saint-Sernin, Toulouse|Saint-Sernin]], Toulouse.&lt;ref name=OME/&gt;&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt;&lt;ref name=RH/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Figurative sculpture====
{{main|Romanesque art}}
With the fall of the Roman Empire, the tradition of carving large works in stone and sculpting figures in bronze died out. The best-known surviving large sculptural work of Proto-Romanesque Europe is the life-size wooden Crucifix commissioned by [[Gero (Archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Gero of Cologne]] in about 960–65.&lt;ref&gt;See details at [[Cologne Cathedral]].&lt;/ref&gt; During the 11th and 12th centuries, figurative sculpture flourished in a distinctly Romanesque style that can be recognised across Europe, although the most spectacular sculptural projects are concentrated in South-Western France, Northern Spain and Italy.

Major figurative decoration occurs particularly around the portals of cathedrals and churches, ornamenting the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]], lintels, jambs and central posts. The tympanum is typically decorated with the imagery of [[Christ in Majesty]] with the symbols of the [[Four Evangelists]], drawn directly from the gilt covers of medieval [[Gospel Book]]s. This style of doorway occurs in many places and continued into the Gothic period. A rare survival in England is that of the "Prior's Door" at [[Ely Cathedral]]. In France, many have survived, with impressive examples at the [[Abbey of Saint-Pierre, Moissac]], the [[Abbey of Sainte-Marie, Souillac]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Howe |first=Jeffery |title=Romanesque Architecture (slides) |work=A digital archive of architecture |publisher=[[Boston College]] |url= http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/fnart/arch/souillac.html |accessdate=2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Abbey of la Madaleine, Vézelay]]&amp;nbsp;– all daughter houses of Cluny, with extensive other sculpture remaining in cloisters and other buildings. Nearby, [[Autun Cathedral]] has a [[Last Judgement]] of great rarity in that it has uniquely been signed by its creator Giselbertus (who was perhaps the patron rather than the sculptor).&lt;ref name=HG/&gt;&lt;ref name=RH/&gt; The same artist is thought to have worked at la Madaleine Vezelay which uniquely has two elaborately carved tympanum, the early inner one representing the Last Judgement and that on the outer portal of the narthex representing Jesus [[Great Commission|sending forth the Apostles]] to preach to the nations.

It is a feature of Romanesque art, both in manuscript illumination and sculptural decoration, that figures are contorted to fit the space that they occupy. Among the many examples that exist, one of the finest is the figure of the [[Jeremiah (prophet)|Prophet Jeremiah]] from the pillar of the portal of the [[Abbey of Saint-Pierre, Moissac]], France, from about 1130.&lt;ref name=RH/&gt; A significant motif of Romanesque design is the spiral, a form applied to both plant motifs and drapery in Romanesque sculpture. An outstanding example of its use in drapery is that of the central figure of Christ on the outer portal at [[Vézelay Abbey|La Madaleine, Vezelay]].&lt;ref name=RH/&gt;

Many of the smaller sculptural works, particularly capitals, are Biblical in subject and include scenes of [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] and the [[Adam and Eve|Fall of Man]], episodes from the life of Christ and those [[Old Testament]] scenes that [[Typology (theology)|prefigure]] his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Death]] and [[Resurrection]], such as [[Jonah|Jonah and the Whale]] and [[Daniel in the lions' den]]. Many [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]] scenes occur, the theme of the [[Three Kings]] being particularly popular. The cloisters of [[Santo Domingo de Silos Abbey]] in Northern Spain, and [[Moissac]] are fine examples surviving complete.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Murals====
The large wall surfaces and plain curving vaults of the Romanesque period lent themselves to mural decoration. Unfortunately, many of these early wall paintings have been destroyed by damp or the walls have been replastered and painted over. In most of Northern Europe such pictures were systematically destroyed in bouts of [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] [[iconoclasm]]. In other countries they have suffered from war, neglect and changing fashion.

A classic scheme for the full painted decoration of a church, derived from earlier examples often in [[mosaic]], had, as its focal point in the [[semi-dome]] of the apse, [[Christ in Majesty]] or Christ the Redeemer enthroned within a [[mandorla]] and framed by the four winged beasts, symbols of the [[Four Evangelists]], comparing directly with examples from the gilt covers or the illuminations of [[Gospel Book]]s of the period. If the [[Virgin Mary]] was the dedicatee of the church, she might replace Christ here. On the apse walls below would be saints and apostles, perhaps including narrative scenes, for example of the saint to whom the church was dedicated. On the sanctuary arch were figures of apostles, prophets or the twenty-four "[[Heavenly host|elders of the Apocalypse]]", looking in towards a bust of Christ, or his symbol the Lamb, at the top of the arch. The north wall of the nave would contain narrative scenes from the Old Testament, and the south wall from the New Testament. On the rear west wall would be a [[Doom paintings|Doom painting]] or [[Last Judgement]], with an enthroned and judging Christ at the top.&lt;ref&gt;James Hall, ''A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art'', p154, 1983, John Murray, London, {{ISBN|0-7195-3971-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most intact schemes to exist is that at [[Abbey Church of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe|Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe]] in France. &lt;small&gt;(See picture above under "Vault")&lt;/small&gt; The long barrel vault of the nave provides an excellent surface for fresco, and is decorated with scenes of the [[Old Testament]], showing the [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]], the [[Adam and Eve|Fall of Man]] and other stories including a lively depiction of [[Noah's Ark]] complete with a fearsome figurehead and numerous windows through with can be seen the Noah and his family on the upper deck, birds on the middle deck, while on the lower are the pairs of animals. Another scene shows with great vigour the swamping of Pharaoh's army by the Red Sea. The scheme extends to other parts of the church, with the martyrdom of the local saints shown in the crypt, and [[Apocalypse]] in the narthex and Christ in Majesty. The range of colours employed is limited to light blue-green, yellow ochre, reddish brown and black. Similar paintings exist in Serbia, Spain, Germany, Italy and elsewhere in France.&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt;

====Stained glass====
The oldest-known fragments of medieval pictorial stained glass appear to date from the 10th century. The earliest intact figures are five prophet windows at Augsburg, dating from the late 11th century. The figures, though stiff and formalised, demonstrate considerable proficiency in design, both pictorially and in the functional use of the glass, indicating that their maker was well accustomed to the medium. At Canterbury and Chartres Cathedrals, a number of panels of the 12th century have survived, including, at Canterbury, a figure of Adam digging, and another of his son Seth from a series of [[Ancestors of Christ]]. Adam represents a highly naturalistic and lively portrayal, while in the figure of Seth, the robes have been used to great decorative effect, similar to the best stone carving of the period.

Many of the magnificent stained glass windows of France, including the famous windows of Chartres, date from the 13th century. Far fewer large windows remain intact from the 12th century. One such is the Crucifixion of Poitiers, a remarkable composition that rises through three stages, the lowest with a quatrefoil depicting the Martyrdom of St Peter, the largest central stage dominated by the crucifixion and the upper stage showing the [[Ascension of Christ]] in a mandorla. The figure of the crucified Christ is already showing the Gothic curve. The window is described by George Seddon as being of "unforgettable beauty".&lt;ref name=GS&gt;George Seddon in Lee, Seddon and Stephens, ''Stained Glass''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transitional style and the continued use of Romanesque forms===
During the 12th century, features that were to become typical of [[Gothic architecture]] began to appear. It is not uncommon, for example, for a part of building that has been constructed over a lengthy period extending into the 12th century, to have very similar arcading of both semi-circular and pointed shape, or windows that are identical in height and width, but in which the later ones are pointed. This can be seen on the towers of [[Tournai Cathedral]] and on the western towers and facade at [[Ely Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=ACT/&gt;&lt;ref name=WS/&gt; Other variations that appear to hover between Romanesque and Gothic occur, such as the facade designed by [[Abbot Suger]] at the Abbey of Saint-Denis, which retains much that is Romanesque in its appearance, and the Facade of [[Laon Cathedral]], which, despite its Gothic form, has round arches.&lt;ref name=WS&gt;Wim Swaan, ''Gothic Cathedrals''&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbot Suger's innovative choir of the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]], 1140–44, led to the adoption of the Gothic style by Paris and its surrounding area, but other parts of France were slower to take it up, and provincial churches continued to be built in the heavy manner and rubble stone of the Romanesque, even when the openings were treated with the fashionable pointed arch.

In England, the Romanesque groundplan, which in that country commonly had a very long nave, continued to affect the style of building of cathedrals and those large abbey churches which were also to become cathedrals at the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] in the 16th century. Despite the fact that English cathedrals were built or rebuilt in many stages, substantial areas of Norman building can be seen in many of them, particularly in the nave arcades. In the case of [[Winchester Cathedral]], the Gothic arches were literally carved out of the existent Norman piers.&lt;ref name=ACT/&gt; Other cathedrals have sections of their building which are clearly an intermediate stage between Norman and Gothic, such as the western towers of [[Ely Cathedral]] and part of the nave at [[Worcester Cathedral]]. The first truly Gothic building in England is the long eastern end of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] commenced in 1175.&lt;ref name=ACT/&gt;

In Italy, although many churches such as [[Florence Cathedral]] and [[Santa Maria Novella]] were built in the Gothic style, or utilising the pointed arch and window tracery, Romanesque features derived from the Roman architectural heritage, such as sturdy columns with capitals of a modified Corinthian form, continued to be used. The pointed vault was utilised where convenient, but it is commonly interspersed with semicircular arches and vaults wherever they conveniently fit. The facades of Gothic churches in Italy are not always easily distinguishable from the Romanesque.

Germany was not quick to adopt the Gothic style, and when it did so in the 1230s, the buildings were often modelled very directly upon French cathedrals, as [[Cologne Cathedral]] was modelled on Amiens. The smaller churches and abbeys continued to be constructed in a more provincial Romanesque manner, the date only being registered by the pointed window openings.&lt;ref name=RH/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Romanesque castles, houses and other buildings==
{{Main|Romanesque secular and domestic architecture}}
The Romanesque period was a time of great development in the design and construction of defensive architecture. After churches and the monastic buildings with which they are often associated, castles are the most numerous type of building of the period. While most are in ruins through the action of war and politics, others, like William the Conqueror's White Tower within the [[Tower of London]] have remained almost intact.

In some regions, particularly Germany, large [[palace]]s were built for rulers and bishops. Local lords built [[great hall]]s in the countryside, while rich merchants built grand [[town house]]s. In Italy, city councils constructed [[town hall]]s, while wealthy cities of Northern Europe protected their trading interests with [[warehouse]]s and commercial premises. All over Europe, dwellers of the town and country built houses to live in, some of which, sturdily constructed in stone, have remained to this day with sufficient of their form and details intact to give a picture of the style of domestic architecture that was in fashion at the time.

Examples of all these types of buildings can be found scattered across Europe, sometimes as isolated survivals like the two merchants' houses on opposite sides of Steep Hill in [[Lincoln, England]], and sometimes giving form to a whole medieval city like [[San Gimignano]] in Tuscany, Italy. These buildings are the subject of a separate article.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Romanesque Revival==
{{Main|Romanesque Revival architecture}} ''See also'' [[Romanesque Revival architecture in the United Kingdom]]
During the 19th century, when [[Gothic Revival architecture]] was fashionable, buildings were occasionally designed in the Romanesque style. There are a number of Romanesque Revival churches, dating from as early as the 1830s and continuing into the 20th century where the massive and "brutal" quality of the Romanesque style was appreciated and designed in brick.

The [[Natural History Museum, London]], designed by [[Alfred Waterhouse]], 1879, on the other hand, is a Romanesque revival building that makes full use of the decorative potential of Romanesque arcading and architectural sculpture. The Romanesque appearance has been achieved while freely adapting an overall style to suit the function of the building. The columns of the foyer, for example, give an impression of incised geometric design similar to those of Durham Cathedral. However, the sources of the incised patterns are the trunks of palms, cycads and tropical tree ferns. The animal motifs, of which there are many, include rare and exotic species.

The type of modern buildings for which the Romanesque style was most frequently adapted was the warehouse, where a lack of large windows and an appearance of great strength and stability were desirable features. These buildings, generally of brick, frequently have flattened buttresses rising to wide arches at the upper levels after the manner of some Italian Romanesque facades. This style was adapted to suit commercial buildings by opening the spaces between the arches into large windows, the brick walls becoming a shell to a building that was essentially of modern steel-frame construction, the architect [[Henry Hobson Richardson]] giving his name to the style, [[Richardsonian Romanesque]]. Good examples of the style are [[Marshall Field's Wholesale Store]], Chicago, by H.H. Richardson, 1885, and the Chadwick Lead Works in [[Boston]], USA, by [[William G. Preston|William Preston]], 1887. The style also lent itself to the building of cloth mills, steelworks and powerstations.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref name=NP/&gt;

[[File:Tiziano,_san_girolamo_penitente.jpg|thumb|300px]]
'''''Saint Jerome in Penitence''''' or '''''Penitent Saint Jerome''''' is a c.1531 oil on canvas painting [[Titian]], now in the [[Louvre]] in Paris. It is first mentioned in the collections of [[Louis XIV]] and may have come from the [[Gonzaga collection]], perhaps making it the ''Saint Jerome'' mentioned in [[Federico II Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua|Federico Gonzaga]]'s correspondence, which can be dated to 1531. A second theory argues that the work was intended for Federico's mother [[Isabella d'Este]], who wanted a nocturnal scene.

[[File:Sekhmet_(British_Museum).jpg|thumb]]

The '''Sekhmet statues''', dating back to the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] during the 18th dynasty and later dynasties, are statues of the Eqyptian god [[Sekhmet]].  

Sekhmet statues can be found throughout [[Egypt]], [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], [[Karnak]] and even Africa. They are found throughout Egypt due to rulers moving them from their original location. Sekhmet statues give us information of the Sekhmet goddess, Egyptian art, kings, religion, and culture of Egypt.

==Depiction of the Goddess Sekhmet==

The statues are a depiction of the goddess Sekhmet showing her lioness features from head to toe. The statues feature the fierce eye of the sun god [[Ra|Re]] and its jaw structure the goddess is known for. The goddess has violent characteristics that can cause destruction and illness. Sekhmet's name means "who is powerful". The follower must please the Sekhmet goddess by praying and giving offerings to her Sekhmet statue. If done correctly the Sekhmet would bring peace and help when sick or at war.

==Origin==
The origin of the Sekhmet statues was during the reign of [[Amenhotep III]] dynasty 18 (ca 1390-1352 BC). There have been more than six hundred statues that have been recovered from Egypt. Most of these Sekhmet statues were created under Amenhotep III. Sekhmet statues have been found at Amenhotep III Mortuary Temple/Complex at [[Kom el Heittan]] on the Theban West Bank and at the [[Temple of Mut]] at Karnak on the east bank of the [[Nile River]] at Thebes. Sekhmet statues can still be found and traced back to Amenhotep III. The Sekhmet statues are a part of his massive statuary program.

Amenhotep III hoped that the Sekhmet statues would heal him from illness and bring him good fortune for the year. This is why there were so many Sekhmet statues being built and at such a fast pace. We can tell Amenhotep III favored the Sekhmet goddess since he used her statues so much for ritual practices. Many scholars believe that there were a total of 730 statues built which is two statues for everyday of the year.

==Influence==
* The Sekhmet statues play a huge role religiously because they were used during Amenhotep III reign to cure him from illness. He created 730 statues in total for everyday of the year to bring good fortune. Many priests would present the statue with offerings and prayers to appease the goddess Sekhmet through the statue.
* The Sekhmet statue was used to bring balance between the Goddess [[Mut]] peace and the Goddess Sekhmet's fierceness. Sekhmet statue is the aggressive representation of Mut.
* Sekhmet statue was prayed to and offered by priests to make sure the town wouldn't get destroyed or bring famine. Yoyotte lists offerings to the Sekhmet statue such as geese, antelopes, beer, wine and [[sistra]]. 
* The Sekhmet statue was also a [[celestial map]] that was used during the jubilee festivals and [[sed]] festivals. Tiny lute dancers would dance to the Sekhmet statue in festivals to appease the Goddess
* Sekhmet statue is involved in a family triad with [[Ptah]] and are unified by their child [[Ramesses II]] which is mythologically the god of [[Nefertem]]. The statue can be found in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo. Together they are seen as a family triad. This family triad shows how many divinities were worshipped together at Memphis in the 19th dynasty. The statues purpose was meant to protect and heal.
* Sekhmet Statue has the eye of the sun god Re. The statue is supposed to depict her fierceness and strength. To kings the statue was military atroness and a symbol of power in battle since the Goddess was the smiter of the [[Nubians]].
* Amulets of Sekhmet were like mini statues for people for the new year.
* The Sekhmet statue has many [[epithets]] that show her as beloved to the king as well as describe her as a Goddess.
* The Sekhmet statue helps give [[Egyptologists]] a time period, Egyptian culture and Egyptian art.

==Description==

There are two types of Sekhmet statues. There are some standing statues and there are some seated statues. Sekhmet statues are made of black [[grandiorite]] with different types of stones. Since there are over 57 types of grandiorite found in the statues this opens new perspectives of the workshops and of how the statues were made. The statues may have not all been made by the same sculptor since they vary in size. The statues consist of litany stone that is used to help appease the goddess. Sekhmet statues measurements vary depending if you're looking at a standing or seated statue that is complete. Average measurements of a Sekhmet statue are a height of 210&amp;nbsp;cm (82 11/16 in.), width of base 47.5&amp;nbsp;cm (18 11/16 in.) and d 95.5&amp;nbsp;cm (375/8 in.). The statues can be twice the height of someone or taller and can weigh two tons.

The statues leave people in awe with their fiery eye of Re and jaw structure of the goddess Sekhmet. The statue is a zoomorphic form of a lioness. Egyptian artists were great at putting human and animal forms together in equal power and truth. The head of the statues have a sun disk and [[Uraeus]] on the top which is connected by a dove tail groove. The sun disk would've been placed in the back pillar. There are rare  depictions of the statue wearing a double crown representing the fusion of Sekhmet and Mut. The statues are made in pieces and we know that from the fragments and unfinished statues. The statue wears a tight fitting gown/garment and the bodice rises up to the breasts. The upper body is nude. There is a broad collar on the shoulders and it is visible between the dress straps. The aegis is represented in the metal collar. The gown is tight all the way down to the legs below the hem and it's wide. The dress is meant to be the color red and would represent mistress aspect and symbolize lower Egypt and warlike nature. Sekhmet statues have accessories like ankle bands and bracelets. The dress is conservative for the time period. There is a daisy over each breast. This daisy can be seen on [[Queen Tia]], Queen Tiy and on the private people of Amenhotep III. The large [[Rosette (design)|rosette]] over the greats are meant to reflect patterns in the shoulder hair of lions and another theory is that they reflect astronomical symbolism of the shoulder star of the constellation Leo in Egyptian astronomical paintings.

Sekhmet statues wear a wig arranged in separate strands like real hair. The wig falls down to the breasts. The Sekhmet statues show the anatomy of the Sekhmet. They have a low rolling back. The ruff on the lions face from the statue is female and is different from the ruff of a male. There are detailed carved whiskers, furrows, hair tiffs and elaborate [[ankh]] signs. On the standing statues the whiskers and [[papyrus]] scepter are more detailed. The standing Sekhmet statues all hold a papyrus [[scepter]] in the left hand and the ankh sign which is the symbol of life in the right hand. The papyrus the statue holds is a symbol of her native lower Egypt and is meant to unite upper and lower Egypt. The seated statues all hold the ankh sign on the left hand and their right hand flat on the thigh. The seated statues feet are always together. The standing statues should have an inscribed base  but is sometimes found missing. The seated statues all are on Royal thrones similar to what kings would use. The kings name is on the front of the throne and is dedicated to Sekhmet. The thrones are ornamented on the sides of the seated statues. The statutes throne include hieroglyphics and a regulated border pattern and lower corner of the rectangle design. The thrones are inscribed with the names of past kings not just Amenhotep III but of Ramsess II, [[Pinudjem II]], [[Sheshonk I]] that are from later dynasties and was a convenient quarry for them. The inscriptions on the statues let us know from what period they're from. They also tell us about Sekhmet and the king.

==Epithets==

Epithets are inscriptions on the throne of statues. They show characteristics of kings, gods/goddesses. There are many epithets found on the Sekhmet statues, for example:
* "The good god lord of the cult act, [[Nebmaatre]], beloved of Sekhmet, given life forever."
* "The son of Re Amenhotep, ruler of Thebes beloved of Sekhmet, the great, mistress of the sky, forever."
* "The king of upper and lower Egypt, lord of appearances Nebmaatre, beloved of Amun, king of the god, forever, the son of Re of his body Amenhotep ruler of ruler of Thebes, beloved of Amun Re, lord of the thrones of the two lands forever."
These type of epithets show the Sekhmet statutes connection to Jubilees, sed festivals and calendar aspects. Sekhmet's nature is shown from the epithets on the statue as fierce and powerful. She's depicted on the statues as a mistress and smiter of the Nubians. There are so many epithets found from the Sekhmet statues that tell us about the kings of Egypt, Sekhmet and the culture. The epithets on the thrones are single perpendicular lines down either side of the front seat. There are [[prenomens]] and nomens of the king.

==Theories==

Some Egyptologists question if all statues came from Amenhotep III mortuary temple because the saite proportion standing of the statues. Some of the statues have a uniform matte finish which can mean they're from different times or from different workshops. Some say the finest works are from Amenhotep III because of the detailed filled dots for the whiskers and talon shaped hooks beneath the inside corner of each eye on the Sekhmet statue. Yoyette links Amenhotep III Sekhmet statues eptihets to various recessions of late Sekhmet litanies from the edfu dendera Kom ombo and Tod. Litany was used to help the goddess from destruction. Sekhmet has been around long and can be connected to Hathor, Bastet  for good fortune.Yoyette, Germond, Betsy believes the statues were designed for festival rituals.

==Location/Excavations==

The statues can be found throughout the temple of Mut and the mortuary temple of Amenhotep III. Many excavators have documented their finds. From excavations, Egyptologists have come across both completed, destroyed and fragments of the statues. In 1915 the Met Museum received a Sekhmet statue as a gift of Henry Walters and that particular statue can be traced to the Amenhotep III mortuary temple. The statues at the Met Museum were found at the latter site of Amenhotep III. At the temple of Amenhotep III the statues were set in lavish fashion in double rows, one behind the other. The statues looked as if they were ready for battle. Sekhmet statues at Kom el Heittan can be found at the courts aligned with other divine statues. The statues would form a celestial map that would be the kings eternal ritual calendar. This would explain why there were so many statues built.

The statues at Amenhotep III temple wasn't a good place for them topography wise because they were put in an area that suffered from rising ground water and would destroy the statues. For that reason the statues were moved to other sites like the temple of Mut. Sekhmet statues found at the temple of Mut on the east bank at Luxor were the same ones used in Amenhotep III courts. The Sekhmet goddess and goddess Mut are linked together. Mut is the wife of Amun and was worshipped at the Mut Precinct. The Sekhmet statues had begun to be moved to the temple of Mut by the 19th dynasty. The statues were identified together and give religious influence. The two statues religious influence were meant to balance each other with fierce and gentle attributes and avoid destruction.
  
The [[British Museum]] has the largest collection of Sekhmet statues outside of Egypt. Many of the statues can still be found at their original sites. The statues were positioned near the sacred lake in the temple of Mut. Other areas where rituals that involve Sekhmet are by similar kidney shaped lakes. Many felt the number of statues found is unusual, but when looking at the evidence they were used as a calendar and for sed festivals. The statues were used in rituals to please the goddess. Sekhmet statues at Mut at Karnak on the east bank at Luxor were from Amenhotep III courts. The statues can be traced back through the epithets found on the statues.

Albert's excavations in 1831 found the Sekhmet statues at the mortuary temple in Thebes. Albert discusses how well the statues were put into rows at the Amenhotep III mortuary temple. Marriette describes the Sekhmet statues in the temple of Mut in double rows and are on the north east, west sides of the first court and some were in a single row along the south side at the court. At four sides of the second court behind the square Piers of a colonnade on the north east and west sides of the court, south side along the main wall depressing this second court from [[hypostyle]]. The statues are at Mut in rows in the north side of the first court looking north west. They're on the north side of 2nd court look northwest and are on the foreground south side of the 2nd court. They can be seen in the western corridor from the north Belonzi and at Karnak. Egyptologists like Betsy Bryan have connected the statues to the new year and jubilee festivals of Amenhotep III. Egyptologists use Decans that of southern heavens that link to Sekhmet. Decans are time keepers and help the king in appeasement. Decans are found on the sides of the Sekhmet statues. Sekhmet statues are connected with jubilee festivals through hymns. 730 Sekhmet statues are on the Kom ombo hymn and speaks of the statue as "she whom his majesty follows in the number of 730 lady of years, so reigned of months and of days argues large numbers of statues". Using hymns, epithets and seeing how the statues were placed egyptologist believe Sekhmet statues make a sky map for the jubilee. Sourouzian gives great chronology from excavations she's been a part of at the temple of Amnehotep. He shows how different stones were implemented into the statues. Betsy Bryan and her team at Mout in 2004 wanted to bring back the statues to Kom el Heittan. There were many opinions of how many statues there were at the temple of Mut and at Amenhotep III mortuary temple. Yoyette said 730 Sekhmet statues  and Marriette guessed 572 Sekhmet statues. Benson and Gourlay believed Mut had 500 statues.

Sourouzian found many statues at Amenhotep III temple, temple of Amun at Karnak and on the Montu temple precinct at Karnak north.  During the 20th century H Swiss institute uncovered Sekhmet statues from Kom el Heittan. Bases of the Sekhmet statues were stored in Medinet Habu. No 1999/2000 statues were found at the [[peristyle]] court and second pylons. In 2003 six statues were found at the hypostyle square. In 2005 five statues found at peristyle north and east portico. In Spring of 2005 statues were found on the east portico and on the west trench. In 2006 after removing the water blocking the excavations there were more statues found at the peristyle court and hypostyle hall. Usually feet and bases are missing from the statues. The Sekhmet statue is found at the sanctuary at Abusir from the Graeco Roman period. The Sekhmet statues led to further cult centers at Kom el Hisn in the western delta with Hathor. The statue at the Temple of Ptah at Karnak was broken in the 20th century since the locals feared she might harm their kids. Museums will set up the statues in a similar fashion in the same way that they were placed at the Temple of Mut.

'''Somali architecture''' is the [[engineering]] and [[designing]] of multiple different [[construction]] types such as stone cities, [[castles]], [[citadel]]s, [[fortresses]], [[mosques]], [[temples]], [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]], [[lighthouses]], towers and [[tombs]] during the ancient, [[medieval]] and [[early modern]] periods in [[Somalia]] and other regions inhabited by Somalis, as well as the fusion of Somalo-Islamic architecture with Western designs in [[contemporary architecture|contemporary]] times.

==Ancient==

===Walled settlements, temples and tombs===
[[File:Qableh3.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Ancient [[cairn]]s in [[Qa’ableh]].]]
Some of the oldest known structures in the territory of modern-day Somalia consist of burial [[cairn]]s (''taalo'').&lt;ref name="Mheah"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hodd|first=Michael|title=East African Handbook|year=1994|publisher=Trade &amp; Travel Publications|isbn=978-0-8442-8983-0|page=640|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bL8tAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although found throughout the country and the larger [[Horn of Africa]] region, northern Somalia in particular is home to numerous such archaeological structures, with many similar edifices found at [[Haylan]], [[Qa’ableh]], [[Qombo'ul]], [[El Ayo]], [[Damo, Somalia|Damo]], [[Maydh]] and [[Heis (town)|Heis]] among other towns. However, many of these ancient structures have yet to be properly explored, a process which would help shed further light on local history and facilitate their preservation for posterity.&lt;ref name="Mheah"/&gt;

Houses were constructed of [[Stonemasonry|dressed stone]] similar to the ones in [[Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Man, God and Civilization pg 216&lt;/ref&gt; There are also examples of [[courtyard]]s and large stone walls enclosing settlements, such as the [[Wargaade Wall]].
[[File:Darod2.JPG|thumb|right|150px|[[Abdirahman bin Isma'il al-Jabarti|Sheikh Darod]]'s tomb in the ancient town of [[Haylaan]].]]
Near [[Bosaso]], at the end of the Baladi valley, lies a 2&amp;nbsp;km to 3&amp;nbsp;km long [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]].&lt;ref name="Mheah"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Astgi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ali|first=Ismail Mohamed|title=Somalia Today: General Information|year=1970|publisher=Ministry of Information and National Guidance, Somali Democratic Republic|page=295|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tMVAAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local tradition recounts that the massive embankment marks the grave of a community matriarch. It is the largest such structure in the wider Horn region.&lt;ref name="Astgi"/&gt;

In addition, old temples situated in the northwestern town of [[Sheikh, Somalia|Sheekh]] are reportedly similar to those in the [[Deccan Plateau]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name="Sgmsaos"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Some account of Somaliland: With Notes on Journeys Through the Gadabürsi and Western Ogaden countries, 1896–1897 | journal=Scottish Geographical Magazine | year=1898 | volume=14 | issue=2 | pages=57–73 | doi=10.1080/00369229808732974|last1 = Pease|first1 = Alfred E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There also exist several ancient [[necropolis]]es in Somalia. One such structured area is found on the country's northeastern tip, in the [[Ras Hafun|Hafun peninsula]].&lt;ref name="Nrsctw"&gt;{{cite book|title=Somalia Calling the World|author=National Review|year=1965|pages=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ll4MAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Booco]] in the [[Aluula District]] contains a number of ancient structures. Two of these are enclosed platform monuments set together, which are surrounded by small [[stone circle]]s. The circles of stone are believed to mark associated graves.&lt;ref name="Tpficss"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Somali Studies International Association|first1=Hussein Mohamed Adam, Charles Lee Geshekter (ed.)|title=The Proceedings of the First International Congress of Somali Studies|date=1992|publisher=Scholars Press|isbn=978-0891306580|pages=37 &amp; 40|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=mM8tAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mudun]] is situated in the Wadi valley of the [[Iskushuban District]]. The area features a number of ruins, which local tradition holds belong to an ancient, large town. Among the old structures are around 2,000 tombs, which possess high towers and are dome-shaped.&lt;ref name="Mheah" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Astgi" /&gt;

[[Port Dunford]] in the southern [[Lower Juba]] province contains a number of ancient ruins, including several [[pillar tomb]]s. Prior to its collapse, one these structures' pillars stood 11 meters high from the ground, making it the tallest tower of its kind in the wider region.&lt;ref name="Adam106"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hussein Mohamed Adam, Charles Lee Geshekter (ed.)|title=The Proceedings of the First International Congress of Somali Studies|date=1992|publisher=Scholars Press|isbn=978-0891306580|page=106|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=mM8tAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is believed to correspond with the ancient emporium of [[Nikon (Somalia)|Nikon]], which is described in the 1st century CE Greco-Roman travelogue the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]''.&lt;ref name="Mokhtar311"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mokhtar|first1=G.|title=Ancient Civilizations of Africa|date=1990|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520066977|page=311|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=aDxMF-6UdCQC|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the southern town of [[Hannassa]], ruins of houses with archways and [[courtyard]]s have been found along with other pillar tombs, including a rare octagonal tomb.&lt;ref name="Arotssc"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanseverino|first1=Hilary Costa|title=Archaeological Remains on the Southern Somali Coast|journal=Azania: Archaeological Research in Africa|date=1983|volume=18|issue=1|pages=151–164|doi=10.1080/00672708309511319|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00672708309511319#.VGJ0To938jg|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, various pillar tombs exist in the southeastern Marca area. Local tradition holds that these were built in the 16th century, when the [[Ajuran Sultanate]]'s [[Somali aristocratic and court titles|naa'ibs]] governed the district.&lt;ref name="Cassanelli97"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cassanelli|first1=Lee V.|title=The Shaping of Somali Society: Reconstructing the History of a Pastoral People, 1600 to 1900|date=1982|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0812278323|page=97|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=mlhyAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Menhirs and dolmens===
{{Somali Architecture|image=}}
On the coastal plain 20&amp;nbsp;km to [[Alula, Somalia|Alula]]'s east are found ruins of an ancient monument in a platform style. The structure is formed by a rectangular [[dry stone]] wall that is low in height; the space in between is filled with rubble and manually covered with small stones. Relatively large standing stones are also positioned on the edifice's corners. Near the platform are graves, which are outlined in stones. 24 m by 17 m in dimension, the structure is the largest of a string of ancient platform and enclosed platform monuments exclusive to far northeastern Somalia.&lt;ref name="Ncaaroth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chittick|first=Neville|title=An Archaeological Reconnaissance of the Horn: The British-Somali Expedition|year=1975|pages=117–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 200 stone monuments (''taalos'') are found in the northeastern [[Botiala]] site, most of which consist of [[cairn]]s. The bigger cairns are covered in shingles and tend to be more sturdily constructed. There are a number of rows of standing stones ([[menhir]]s) on the eastern side of the structures, which are similar to those at [[Salweyn]], a great cairn-held situated close to [[Heis (town)|Heis]]. Besides cairns, the Botiala area also features a few other drystone monuments. These include disc monuments with circular, ground-level features, as well as low, rectangular platform monuments.&lt;ref name="Ncnsaa"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chittick|first1=Neville|title=Newsletter of the Society of Africanist Archaeologists, Issues 24-32|date=1984|publisher=Department of Archaeology, University of Calgary|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=lgnxAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northern town of Aw Barkhadle, named in honour of the 13th century scholar and saint [[Yusuf bin Ahmad al-Kawneyn]] (Aw Barkhadle), is surrounded by a number of ancient structures. Among these are menhirs, burial mounds, and [[dolmen]]s.&lt;ref name="Btgpb"&gt;{{cite book|last=Briggs|first=Phillip|title=Somaliland|year=2012|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-371-9|page=98|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=M6NI2FejIuwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stelae===
Near the ancient northwestern town of [[Amud]], whenever an old site had the prefix ''Aw'' in its name (such as the ruins of ''Aw Bare'' and ''[[Aw Bube]]''&lt;ref name="Lewis90"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=I.M.|title=Saints and Somalis: Popular Islam in a Clan-based Society|page=90|publisher=The Red Sea Press|year=1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P5AZyEhMtbkC&amp;pg=PA89|isbn=978-1-56902-103-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;), it denoted the final resting place of a local saint.&lt;ref&gt;G.W.B. Huntingford, "The Town of Amud, Somalia", ''Azania'', '''13''' (1978), p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys by A.T. Curle in 1934 on several of these important ruined cities recovered various [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]], such as [[pottery]] and [[coin]]s, which point to a medieval period of activity at the tail end of the [[Adal Sultanate]]'s reign.&lt;ref name="Lewis90"/&gt; Among these settlements, Aw Barkhadle is surrounded by a number of ancient [[stela]]e.&lt;ref name="Btgpb"/&gt; Burial sites near [[Burao]] likewise feature old stelae.&lt;ref name="Shaanm"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Museums|url=http://www.somaliheritage.org/museums.php|publisher=Somali Heritage and Archaeology|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval==
[[File:Zayla.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ruins of the [[Sultanate of Adal]] in [[Zeila]].]]
The introduction of [[Islam]] in the early medieval era of Somalia's history brought [[Islamic architecture|Islamic architectural influences]] from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and [[Persia]]. This stimulated a shift from drystone and other related materials in construction to coral stone, [[mud-brick|sundried bricks]], and the widespread use of [[limestone]] in Somali architecture. Many of the new architectural designs such as mosques were built on the ruins of older structures, a practice that would continue over and over again throughout the following centuries.&lt;ref name="Abdullahi2"&gt;Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi, ''Culture and Customs of Somalia'', (Greenwood Press: 2001), p.102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stone cities===
[[File:Marka,Somalia.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Whitewash]]ed coral stone city of [[Merca]].]]
The lucrative [[commerce|commercial networks]] of successive medieval [[Somali people|Somali]] [[empire]]s and [[Monarchy|kingdoms]] such as the [[Adal Sultanate]], [[Sultanate of Mogadishu]], [[Warsangali Sultanate]], [[Ajuran Sultanate]], and the [[Sultanate of the Geledi]] saw the establishment of several dozen stone cities in the interior of Somalia as well as the coastal regions. [[Ibn Battuta]] visiting [[Mogadishu]] in the early 14th century called it a town ''endless in size'' &lt;ref&gt;The Archaeology of Islam in Sub Saharan Africa pg 62&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vasco Da Gama]] who passed by Mogadishu in the 15th century noted that it was a large city with houses of four or five storeys high and big palaces in its centre&lt;ref&gt;Da Gama's First Voyage pg.88&lt;/ref&gt;

Somali merchants were an integral part of a long distance caravan trade network connecting major Somali cities, such as Mogadishu, [[Merca]], [[Zeila]], [[Barawa]] and [[Qandala]], with other business centers in the Horn of Africa. The numerous ruined and abandoned towns throughout the interior of Somalia can be explained as the remains of a once booming inland trade dating back to the medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;Shaping of Somali Society - Lee Cassanelli pg.149&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Goan Bogame]], situated in the [[Las Anod District]], contains the ruins of a large ancient city with around two hundred buildings. The structures were built in an architectural style similar to that of the edifices in Mogadishu's old Hamar Weine and Shangani districts.&lt;ref name="Mheah" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Astgi" /&gt;

===Castles and fortresses===
[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-8-36.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Aerial view of [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]]'s main fort in [[Taleh]], the capital of his [[Dervish State]].]]
Throughout the [[medieval]] era, castles and fortresses known as ''Qalcads'' were built by Somali [[Sultans]] for protection against both foreign and domestic threats. The major medieval Somali power engaging in castle building was the [[Ajuran Sultanate]], and many of the hundreds of ruined fortifications dotting the landscapes of Somalia today are attributed to Ajuran [[engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaping of Somali Society pg 101&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kingosmanbargaalcast.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Ruins of the [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] King [[Osman Mahamuud]]'s castle in [[Bargal]], built in 1878.]]
Other castle building powers were the Warsangali Sultanate and the [[Bari, Somalia|Bari Sultanate]]. The many castles and fortresses such as the Sha'a Castle, the Bandar Qassim Castles and the [[Botiala]] Fortress Complex and dozens of others in towns such as Qandala, [[Bosaso]] and [[Las Khorey]] were built under their rule.

The [[Dervish State]] in the late 19th century and early 20th century was another prolific fortress building power in the [[Somali Peninsula]]. In 1913, after the British withdrawal to the coast, the permanent capital and headquarters of the Dervishes was constructed at [[Taleh]], a large walled town with fourteen fortresses. The main fortress, ''Silsilat'', included a walled garden and a guard house. It became the residence of [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]], his wives, family, prominent Somali military leaders, and also hosted several [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]], [[Yemen]]i and German [[dignitary|dignitaries]], architects, [[masonry|masons]] and [[Weapons|arms]] [[manufacturers]].&lt;ref&gt;Taleh W. A. MacFadyen The Geographical Journal, Vol. 78, No. 2 (Aug., 1931), pp. 125-128&lt;/ref&gt; Several dozen other fortresses were built in ''Illig'', [[Eyl]], [[Shimbiris]] and other parts of the [[Horn of Africa]].

===Citadels and city walls===
[[File:Gondereshe2008.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Citadel]] of [[Gondershe]].]]
[[City walls]] were established around the coastal cities of Merca, [[Barawa]] and Mogadishu to defend the cities against powers such as the [[Portuguese Empire]]. During the [[Adal Sultanate|Adal Age]], many of the inland cities such as [[Amud]] and [[Abasa, Somalia|Abasa]] in the northern part of Somalia were built on hills high above [[sea level]] with large defensive stone walls enclosing them. The Bardera [[Insurgent|militants]] during their struggle with the Geledi Sultanate had their main headquarters in the walled city of [[Bardera]] that was reinforced by a large fortress overseeing the [[Jubba]] river. In the early 19th century the citadel of Bardera was sacked by [[Sultan]] [[Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim]] and the city became a [[ghost town]].

Somali city walls also acted as a barrier against the proliferation of [[Weapons|arms]] usually carried by the Somali and Horn African [[nomads]] entering the cities with their [[camel train|caravan trains]]. They had to leave behind their weapons at the [[city gate]] before they could enter the markets with their goods and trade with the urban [[Somalis]], [[Middle Easterners]] and [[Asian people|Asian]] [[merchants]].&lt;ref&gt;Tales which persist on the Tongue - Scott S. Reese pg 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mosques and shrines===
[[File:Hafun, Somalia.jpg|thumb|200px|right|17th-century mosque in [[Hafun]], Somalia.]]
Concordant with the ancient presence of Islam in the Horn of Africa region, mosques in Somalia are some of the oldest on the entire continent. One architectural feature that made Somali mosques distinct from other mosques in Africa were [[minaret]]s.
[[File:Fakr Ud Din Mosque.jpg|thumb|left|13th century [[Fakr ad-Din mosque]] built by Fakr ad-Din, the first Sultan of the [[Sultanate of Mogadishu|Mogadishu Sultanate]].]]
For centuries, [[Arba'a Rukun Mosque|Arba'a Rukun]] (1269), the Friday mosque of [[Merca]] (1609) and [[Fakr ad-Din]] (1269) were, in fact, the only mosques in East Africa to have minarets.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Islamic history and civilization By David Ayalon pg 370&lt;/ref&gt; Arba Rukun's massive round coral tower of about 13 and a half meters high and over four meters in diameter at its base has a doorway that is narrow and surrounded by a multiple ordered recessed arch, which may be the first example of the recessed arch that was to become a prototype for the local mihrab style.

Constructed by and named after the first Sultan of the Mogadishu Sultanate, the Fakr-ad Din mosque dates back to the 1269. Built with [[marble]] and [[coral]] [[Rock (geology)|stone]] on a compact rectangular plan, it features a domed [[mihrab]] central azis. Glazed tiles were also used in the decoration of the mihrab, one of which bears a dated inscription. In addition, the masjid is characterized by a system of composite beams, alongside two main columns. This well-planned, sophisticated design is not replicated in mosques further south outside the Horn region.&lt;ref name="Garlake"&gt;Peter S. Garlake, ''Early art and architecture of Africa'', (Oxford University Press US: 2002), p.176.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 13th century ''Al Gami University'' consisted of a rectangular base with a large cylindrical tower architecturally unique in the [[Islamic world]].
[[File:Ancient-Almnara.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Almnara Tower in Mogadishu.]]
[[Shrines]] erected to house and honor Somali [[patriarchs]] and forefathers evolved from ancient Somali burial customs. Such tombs, which are predominantly found in northern Somalia (the suggested point of origin of the Somalia's majority Somali ethnic group), feature structures mainly consisting of [[domes]] and square plans.&lt;ref name="Abdullahi"&gt;Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi, ''Culture and Customs of Somalia'', (Greenwood Press: 2001), p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; In southern Somalia, the preferred medieval shrine architecture was the [[pillar tomb]]-style.

A number of ancient burial sites dated from the pre-Islamic period sit atop the peak of [[Buur Heybe]], a granitic inselberg in the southern Doi belt. They serve as a center of annual pilgrimage (''siyaro''). These burial sites on the mountain's summit were later made into Muslim holy sites in the ensuing Islamic period, including the Owol Qaasing (derived from the Arabic "Abul Qaasim", one of the names of Prophet [[Muhammad]]) and [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani|Sheikh Abdulqadir al-Jilaani]] (named for the founder of the [[Qadiriyya]] order).&lt;ref name="Mukhtar60"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mukhtar|first1=Mohamed Haji|title=Historical Dictionary of Somalia|date=2003|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0810866041|page=60|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=DPwOsOcNy5YC|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Towers and lighthouses===
Somalia's historical strategic location within the world's oldest and busiest [[Ocean|sealanes]] encouraged the construction of [[lighthouse]]s to co-ordinate shipping and to ensure the safe entrance of commercial vessels in the nation's many [[port city|port cities]]. In times of weak central authority the [[History of Somalia|Somali civilizational]] matrix of interior cities and port cities was based on a clan formula that saw various clans in fierce competition over natural resources that led to chronic feuding between neighbours. Towers provided the merchant class and the urban population protection against potential raids from the nomadic regions. [[Tower house|Stone towers]] such as the 15th century Almnara tower in Mogadishu and the Jamia tower of Merca were also built for defence. The ''Dar Ilalo'' stone towers though initially constructed to defend the fortress of [[Taleex]] were also used as [[Granary|granaries]] for the [[Dervish State]].

==Early modern==
[[File:QandalaCastleTown.jpg|thumb|right|350px|19th century [[castle town]] of [[Qandala]].]]
The early modern period saw a continuation in the use of materials such as coral stone, [[mud-brick|sundried brick]]s and [[limestone]] in Somali architecture which with the increasing European influence on the Somali peninsula was now being complemented by new construction materials such as [[cement]]. The period was characterised by [[military architecture]] in the form of multi-purpose forts, and the construction of new ports. The [[Sultan]]s of [[Aluula]] in the northern part of the country and the [[Geledi Sultanate]] in the south were at their peak during this period, and many of the castles, palaces and forts found in various Somali cities originate from that era.

==1990s to present==

In the modern period, several Somali cities such as [[Mogadishu]], [[Hargeisa]] and [[Garowe]] received large projects, which saw construction in new styles that harmoniously blended in with the existing old architecture. Due to [[Italy|Italian]] influence, parts of Mogadishu are built in the [[Classical architecture|classical style]]. The Somali government continued upon that legacy, while also opening the door to [[Germans|German]], [[United States|American]] and [[China|Chinese]] designers.

As a departure from the prevailing Somali architectural style, the [[National Theatre of Somalia|National Theatre]] in Mogadishu was completely built from a Chinese perspective. The town-hall was constructed in the [[Moroccan style]]. Much of the new architecture also continued upon ancient tradition, the ''Al-Uruba Hotel'', the pre-eminent hotel in Somalia and an iconic feature of Mogadishu's waterfront was entirely designed and constructed by Somalis in the [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]] style.

In recent times, due to the civil war and the subsequent decentralization, many cities across the country have rapidly developed into urban hubs and have adopted their own architectural styles independently. In the cities of [[Garowe]], [[Bosaso]] and Hargeisa, construction firms have built hotels, government facilities, airports and residential neighbourhoods in a [[Modern architecture|modernist style]], often utilizing [[Chromium|chrome]], [[steel]] and [[glass]] materials.

'''''The Dream''''' (French: ''Le Rêve'', occasionally also known as ''Le Songe'' or ''Rêve exotique'') is a large [[oil painting|oil-on-canvas]] painting created by [[Henri Rousseau]] in 1910, one of more than 25 Rousseau paintings with a jungle theme.  His last completed work, it was first exhibited at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] from 18 March to 1 May 1910, a few months before his death on 2 September 1910.  Rousseau's earlier works had received a negative reception, but poet and critic [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] remarked on its debut: "The picture radiates beauty, that is indisputable. I believe nobody will laugh this year."

''The Dream'' is the largest of the jungle paintings, measuring 6' 8½" x 9' 9½"  (204.5 x 298.5&amp;nbsp;cm).  It features an almost [[surrealism|surreal]] portrait of Yadwigha (Jadwiga), Rousseau's Polish mistress from his youth, lying naked on a divan to the left of the painting, gazing over a landscape of lush jungle foliage, including [[lotus flower]]s, and animals including birds, monkeys, an elephant, a lion and lioness, and a snake.  The stylised forms of the jungle plants are based on Rousseau's observations at the [[Paris Museum of Natural History]] and its [[Jardin des Plantes]].   The nude's left arm reaches towards the lions and a black [[snake charmer]] who faces the viewer playing his flute, barely visible in the gloom of the jungle under the dim light of the full moon.  A pink-bellied snake slithers through the undergrowth, its sinuous form reflecting the curves of the woman's hips and leg.

Suspecting that some viewers did not understand the painting, Rousseau wrote a poem to accompany it, ''Inscription pour La Rêve'':
{{verse translation|lang=fra|
Yadwigha dans un beau rêve
S'étant endormie doucement
Entendait les sons d'une musette
Dont jouait un charmeur bien pensant.
Pendant que la lune reflète
Sur les fleuves [or fleurs], les arbres verdoyants,
Les fauves serpents prêtent l'oreille
Aux airs gais de l'instrument.
|
Yadwigha in a beautiful dream
Having fallen gently to sleep
Heard the sounds of a [[Oboe musette|reed instrument]]
Played by a well-intentioned [snake] charmer.
As the moon reflected
On the rivers [or flowers], the verdant trees,
The wild snakes lend an ear
To the joyous tunes of the instrument.
}}

One possible interpretation of the painting, offered by Rousseau in a letter to art critic [[André Dupont]], is that it depicts a woman reclining on a couch in Paris, dreaming she is listening to a flute player in the jungle.

The subject of a reclining nude draws from a classical tradition, from [[Titian]]’s 1538 painting ''[[Venus of Urbino]]'' to [[Manet]]'s 1863 painting ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]''.  Rousseau may have taken some inspiration from [[Émile Zola]]’s novel ''[[Le Rêve (novel)|Le Rêve]]'', which deals with the love between a painter and an embroideress.  While he was painting ''The Dream'', Rousseau was romantically involved with a shop assistant, Leonie.

French art dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]] bought the painting from Rousseau in February 1910.  It was sold through Knoedler Galleries in New York to clothing manufacturer and art collector [[Sidney Janis]] in January 1934.  Janis sold the painting to [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]] in 1954, who donated it to the [[Museum of Modern Art, New York]] to celebrate the Museum's 25th anniversary.  It remains on display at MoMA.

'''''The Falling''''' is a 2014 British mystery [[drama film]] written and directed by [[Carol Morley]]. It stars [[Maisie Williams]] and [[Florence Pugh]] as best friends at an all-girls school. The film also stars [[Greta Scacchi]], [[Monica Dolan]], [[Maxine Peake]], and [[Mathew Baynton]]. Production began in October 2013. The film premiered at the [[BFI London Film Festival]] on 11 October 2014 and was released theatrically on 24 April 2015 in the UK. ''The Falling'' earned £468,762 on a £750,000 budget.

== Plot ==
In 1969, Lydia and Abbie are best friends at an English girls school. Lydia, the neglected daughter of an [[agoraphobic]] mother, becomes fixated on Abbie, who has begun to explore her sexuality. After having sex with Lydia's brother Kenneth in an attempt to abort her pregnancy by another boy, Abbie begins to suffer from [[Mass psychogenic illness|fainting spells]]. She suffers an episode after a stint in detention with Lydia and dies in the process. Following Abbie's burial, Lydia begins suffering as well from fainting spells, and it soon becomes an epidemic, with numerous girls and a young teacher in the school spontaneously passing out for no more than a few seconds. Lydia becomes convinced that the administration must take action, much to the chagrin of the school principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfilms/articles/the_falling_begins_shoot |title=Independent Announces Start of Shoot for Carol Morley's Film ''The Falling'' |work=[[BBC Films]] |accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an assembly becomes disrupted by a mass fainting episode, the school is temporarily shut down and all affected students are hospitalized and psychoanalysed. When no cause for the spells is discovered, the school is reopened and Lydia is expelled. That same night, the virginal Lydia has sex with Kenneth, with whom she has developed an incestuous relationship after Abbie's death. However their mother Eileen catches them and, armed with a pair of scissors, angrily forces Kenneth out of the house before launching into an argument with her daughter, in which she brands Lydia dangerous and that she ought to be locked up. Eileen also reveals that Lydia and Kenneth are only half-siblings; Lydia being the product of a rape. 

Upon learning this, Lydia runs out of the house and Eileen follows her outside, despite having never ventured outside in over 16 years. Searching for Lydia, Eileen is overcome with flashbacks of her own sexual assault, and eventually locates Lydia; who has climbed to the top of a tree in a breakdown over Abbie's death. Eileen pleads with Lydia to come down, but she laughs, challenging her mother's lack of maternal affection, before losing her footing and leaping from the tree into a lake. 

Distraught, Eileen ventures into the water and cradles Lydia's seemingly drowned body, realizing that her emotional frigidity had done more harm to her daughter than she knew. Lydia regains consciousness, and the film ends with the two women in a crying embrace.

'''The Questors Theatre''' is a theatre venue located in the [[London Borough of Ealing]], west [[London]]. It is home of The Questors, a large theatre company which hosts a season of around twenty productions a year and is a member of the ''[[Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain]]'' and the ''[[International Amateur Theatre Association]]''.

==Activities==
The Questors theatre club was founded in 1929 by a group of 17 amateur performers and friends,&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt; and – pursuing an adventurous artistic policy led by one of the founders, Alfred Emmet – has grown into a vibrant theatre company which in the 2013-14 season staged productions of 17 plays (drawing all actors and backstage teams from its membership), and 2 student productions.&lt;ref&gt;The Questors Annual Review 20013/14.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014 the company had 1,344 members (of whom about 300 were actors and about 200 worked backstage and front-of-house, with the remainder supporting the theatre as audience members).&lt;ref&gt;The Questors Annual Review 20013/14.&lt;/ref&gt; The company also runs Questors Academy which provides actor training and a youth theatre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.questors.org.uk/academy (retrieved 6 October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site==
In 1964 The Questors completed the construction of a new theatre building, which was opened by [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother]] in April 1964, replacing the previous theatre building which had been converted from an old church. This new theatre's adaptable configuration was one of the first in a new wave of [[thrust stage]] theatres in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the opening, it was renamed the Judi Dench Playhouse.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2014/questors-theatre-building-renamed-judi-dench-playhouse/ (retrieved 6 October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The site also contains a studio theatre (the [[Constantin Stanislavski|Constantin Stanislavsky]] Room, built as a rehearsal room in 1960 and converted into a studio theatre in 1968), three rehearsal rooms (the [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]] Room built in 1958; the [[Michael Redgrave]] Room, opened in 1968, converted from part of the original Mattock Lodge; and the Alfred Emmet Room built in 1998), a scenery workshop, and a members' bar (The Grapevine, opened in 1959, converted from part of Mattock Lodge).&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original building on the site, Mattock Lodge, is a house dating from the early 1850s, owned from around 1895 by Father O'Halloran who built a small church on the land behind the house, and on his death willed all the property to Miss Ann Webb as life tenant, who then lived in the house with her sister.&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 The Questors theatre club, looking for a permanent venue, were invited to share the old church premises by the Ealing [[Boy Scout]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 The Questors took over as the sole users of the old church building and, following the death of Miss Webb, bought the freehold of the complete site on 25 April 1952 for £8,500.&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New plays==
Throughout their history The Questors have regularly produced new plays, including an annual New Plays Festival from 1960 to 1977. They have staged three new plays by [[Rodney Ackland]] (''The Dark River'', 1943; ''The Diary of a Scoundrel'', adapted from Ostrovsky, 1946; and ''The Other Palace'', 1952), as well five new plays by [[James Saunders (playwright)|James Saunders]], four new plays by [[Dannie Abse]], four new plays by David Mowat, and new plays by [[David Storey]] (''Phoenix'', 1984) and [[Ruth Prawer Jhabvala]] (''Abode of Peace'', 1984).&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1964, The Questors presented six one-act plays at the Forum-Theatre, Berlin. One of these was ''Guildenstern &amp; Rosencrantz'' written and directed by [[Tom Stoppard]]. The cast included [[Peter Whelan]] as Guildenstern. The production was staged the following month at The Questors Theatre, and Stoppard subsequently expanded his one-act play into ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.questors.org.uk/prods/1964/berlinplays/page.html (retrieved 6 October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
The Questors established a Student Group in 1946 to train actors. Initially it was a one-year part-time course, but since 1949 has offered two years of part-time training, based on the acting techniques of [[Constantin Stanislavski]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt; The Questors also run a large youth theatre (which in 2013-14 had about 460 members) and evening classes for beginner actors, and since 2012 have worked in partnership with the [[University of West London]] to provide a BA Hons course in Technical Theatre Production.&lt;ref&gt;The Questors Annual Review 20013/14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coarse acting==

Writer [[Michael Green (humorist)|Michael Green]] drew upon his experiences as an acting member of The Questors (from 1953) when he wrote his book ''[[The Art of Coarse Acting]]'' (published 1964) which he dedicated to The Questors.&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972 The Questors hosted the ''World Coarse Acting Championship'', and then took ''The Coarse Acting Show'' to the 1977 [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] and ''The Coarse Acting Show 2'' to the 1979 Festival Fringe.&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al. &amp; http://archive.questors.org.uk/index.html (retrieved 6 October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Coarse Acting Show 2'' subsequently transferred to the [[Shaftesbury Theatre]], [[London]], where it was visited by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|HRH The Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 The Questors presented the ''Third Great Coarse Acting Show'' at The Questors Theatre (which was again visited by HRH The Prince of Wales), and in 1988 took ''Coarse Acting Strikes Back'' to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al. &amp; http://archive.questors.org.uk/index.html (retrieved 6 October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidents==
Among those who accepted an invitation between 1930 and 1944 to serve as The Questors' Presidents were [[Robert Atkins (actor)|Robert Atkins]], Ion Swinley, [[Ben Webster (actor)|Ben Webster]], [[Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies]] and [[Margaret Webster]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent presidents have been:&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt;
*John Burrell (1944–52)
*[[Tyrone Guthrie]] (1952–58)
*[[Michael Redgrave]] (1958–85)

[[File:Dijon Philippe le Hardi Tombeau5.jpg|thumb|400px|pleurants]]
The '''Tomb of Philip the Bold''' is a  [[Funerary art|funerary monument]] commissioned by the [[Duke of Burgundy]] [[Philip the Bold]] (d. 1404) for his burial at Chartreuse de Champmol. The monument was primarily built by [[Claus Sluter]],&lt;ref name="f172"&gt;Foss, 172.&lt;/ref&gt; with contributions by [[Jean de Marville]] and [[Claus de Werve]]. [[Jean Malouel]], official painter to the duke, is responsible design aspets.&lt;ref name="f172" /&gt; Today it is housed in the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon]]. The tomb was influential; [[John, Duke of Berry|Jean, Duke of Berry]] commissioned a similar work for his own burial.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

The monument is made from [[alabaster]], marble, gilt and paint.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, Napoli. ''The Ethics of Ornament in Early Modern Naples''. Routledge, 215.&lt;/ref&gt; It shows Philip's [[sarcophagus]] [[effigy]] in repose with his hands upright and clasped in prayer. An angel with gilded wings holds a cushion for his head. He rests on a black marble slab, with a lion at his feet. Below him are 41 [[pleurants]] standing in pairs in Gothic niches, arranged in a mourning procession. &lt;ref&gt;Jugie, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip acquired the domain of Champmol, near [[Dijon]], in 1378 to build the [[Chartreuse de Champmol]], a [[Carthusian]] monastery, intended to house the tombs of his dynasty. He was buried in the choir of Chartreuse de Champmol on 16 June 1404, with his organs sent to the church of [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]] at [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]]. In 1792, his body was re-interred at [[Dijon Cathedral]]. The following year his tomb was damaged by revolutionaries and looters. It was restored in the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jugie, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Vestal Virgin Claudia Quinta tows the ship bearing the statue of Cibele''''' is a [[Renaissance|Renaissance art]] painting completed by the Italian painter [[Benvenuto Tisi]] (il Garofalo) and housed in the Pinacoteca of the Gallerie Nazionali di Arte Antica ([[Palazzo Barberini]]) in Rome, Italy.

==Description==
The painting celebrates a semi-historic event occurring in Rome at the end of the [[Second Punic War]]. Rome, stymied in its pursuit of outright victory, and assailed by poor harvests and other misfortunes, had sought the blessings of a new mother goddess ([[Cibele]]) by purchasing a venerable sculpture in [[Phrygia]] (Asia Minor). However, as narrated in the [[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]] by [[Ovid]], the omens became nefarious when the ship porting the statue up the [[Tiber]] to Rome became grounded in a sandbar of the river. [[Claudia Quinta]], a Roman Matron, later identified as a [[Vestal Virgin]], prayed to Cibele for prodigious strength, and was able to wrench the boat from its marooned state, and tow the boat to the city, which the new goddess showered with fortune.

Such classical conceits were common artistic subjects in the court of [[Ferrara]] of this period, where il Garofano worked. The artist is known for painting allegories and classical scenes. At Claudia's feet two dogs represent loyalty, while a crowd of men watch in amazement at her miraculous feat. In the background is an imaginary depiction of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://galleriabarberini.beniculturali.it/index.php?it/138/garofalo-la-vestale-claudia-quinta-traina-la-nave-con-la-statua-di-cibele Entry at Gallerie Nazionali di Arte Antica].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Victor Arthur James Willing''' (15 January 1928 – 1 June 1988) was a British painter, noted for his original nude studies. He was a friend and colleague of many notable artists, including [[Elisabeth Frink]], [[Michael Andrews (artist)|Michael Andrews]] and [[Francis Bacon]]. For his talent and enthusiasm, Willing was dubbed the 'spokesman for his generation'. He was married to Portuguese feminist artist [[Paula Rego]].

==Life and work==
Victor Willing was born in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]], the only son of George Willing, professional soldier, and his wife Irene Cynthia Tomkins.  The first four years of his life were spent there and, briefly, in [[Malta]].  On returning to the UK his father was posted to various parts of southern England including the [[Isle of Wight]] and [[Bordon, Hampshire]].  Willing's education was in consequence rather disrupted until the family moved permanently to [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]] and he was able to attend The [[Royal Grammar School, Guildford|Royal Grammar School]] there, 1940–45.  A year was then spent at Guildford School of Art while he awaited call-up to National Service which duly followed, 1946–48.

He secured a commission as second-lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, serving in [[Northern Ireland]] and at [[Dover]].  On release he was accepted by the [[Slade School of Fine Art]], University of London but only to start in 1949, so he returned for a year to Guildford Art School studying sculpture under [[Willi Soukop]].  A fellow student and friend there at the time was [[Elisabeth Frink]].  He produced two accomplished stone carvings during this year, a female [[torso]] and a head (private collections).

Willing's start at the Slade coincided with [[William Coldstream]]'s arrival there as Director and Professor.  Fellow entrants that year included [[Michael Andrews (artist)|Michael Andrews]], Henry Inlander&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=1335&amp;page=1&amp;sole=y&amp;collab=y&amp;attr=y&amp;sort=default&amp;tabview=bio |title=Inlander short biography |publisher=Tate.org.uk |date=1925-01-14 |accessdate=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and James Burr, while [[Euan Uglow]], [[Craigie Aitchison (painter)|Craigie Aitchison]], [[Paula Rego]] and Myles Murphy also overlapped subsequently.  Other close friends, [[Keith Sutton]] and Peter Snow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartstable.co.uk/gallery.php?cat=10545 |title=Peter Snow short biography |publisher=Theartstable.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; had started the previous year.

Willing was admired by his fellow students for his adventurous talent and intellectual zest and was denoted 'spokesman for his generation' by the critic [[David Sylvester]].  He was deeply fascinated by one of [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]]'s first exhibitions, in 1949, and he invited him to talk at the Slade.  They subsequently became friends and saw a good deal of each other especially after Willing left the Slade in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;see "Walking Wounded" in 1992 and 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Another artist who became a long-standing friend was [[Rodrigo Moynihan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=1674&amp;page=1&amp;sole=y&amp;collab=y&amp;attr=y&amp;sort=default&amp;tabview=bio |title=Moynihan short biography |publisher=Tate.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and each painted the other's portrait.  Willing's portrait of Moynihan is with the [[Royal College of Art]] but Moynihan's of Willing was stolen and was, it is thought, destroyed by the thief.

Willing took his diploma in 1952 and then stayed on for a further year.  Of work produced during these student years rather little survives.  Four paintings, ''Head of a Man (John Mills)'', ''Boy on a Tricycle'' (both private collection), ''Head of a Girl (Paula Rego)'' (Dumfriesshire Educational Trust) and ''Standing Nude'' (Tate Gallery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=2150&amp;page=1 |title=Paintings by Victor Willing in the Tate Gallery collection |publisher=Tate.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are still extant however and possibly two other 'summer compositions', ''Europa and the Bull'' and ''Musicians''.  His diploma painting ''Act of Violence'' is still with University Art Collections, [[University College London|University College]].

In 1951 Willing had married his long-time Guildford girlfriend, Hazel Whittington, and they lived first at [[Shalford, Surrey|Shalford]] near Guildford and, from 1954, in a large maisonette at Lancaster Gate ([[Bayswater]]), London.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, John ''Which Yet Survive: Impressions of Friends, Family and Encounters'', Quartet Books, London, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  He was able to paint there and also in a small studio that he had in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]].

In 1955 [[Erica Brausen]] of the Hanover Gallery gave him a show which was a considerable critical success.  Paintings were bought by the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] and also by Sir Colin Anderson, a notable supporter of young artists.  A star piece of the show, ''Reclining Nude'', went to a Belgian purchaser and has disappeared from view.  Unfortunately there was no catalogue nor, it seems, were the exhibits photographed.

Paintings from around this time, which may have been in the exhibition, are ''Runners'' and ''Man Explaining'' (private collection) and ''Winter Machine'' (Arts Council Collection).  ''Man with a Kitten'' no longer exists but was published in monochrome.&lt;ref&gt;''The Listener'', 15 September 1955 vol LIV no. 1385, p. 430&lt;/ref&gt; An impressive ''Man Watching'' (a sentry standing in front of red railings), which was shown at the ICA in 1953, is believed lost.  There were also a few portraits: ''Andrew Forge'', ''Natasha Spender'' and ''[[Lawrence Alloway]]'' (the last two, whereabouts unknown).

By 1956 Willing's marriage was failing and at the end of that year he left home and the country, eventually to join [[Paula Rego]] in Portugal.  Rego's parents were supportive and the two were able to live quietly at the family quinta in [[Ericeira]] where they both continued to paint.  They were married in 1959 following Willing's divorce from Hazel Whittington.  From 1962 they also had a base in London, a house in Albert Street, [[Camden Town]] which Rego's father, José Figueiroa Rego, had given them.

Although many paintings were produced during this period most were destroyed or painted over.  Survivals&lt;ref&gt;All illustrated in 2000(a)&lt;/ref&gt; include ''Self Portrait'' and ''Standing Figure and Nude'' (1957; two parts of an unfinished triptych).  Willing was discouraged when the more adventurous ''Lech'', ''Precarious Drag'' and ''Untitled'', which relate more closely to his late work, were viewed unfavourably by a critic friend and he reverted to painting (as he put it) 'stodgy nudes'.

The year 1966 brought major upsets to his career as an artist.  Both his father and his father-in-law died and he saw no option but to take on the management of the latter's business interests in Lisbon.  At the same time he was diagnosed as suffering from the early stages of [[multiple sclerosis]].  Art took on a lesser role for the next eight years until the [[Portuguese revolution of 1974]] led to the failure of the business and the eventual return of the family – which now included Caroline, Victoria and [[Nick Willing]] – to live permanently in London.

Willing had decided that he must now return to his true ''métier'' and he rented a room in a disused school in [[Stepney]], east London and began to paint.  Alone for long periods, and standing only with difficulty, he often just sat and looked at the wall.  During these periods of 'reverie' pictures would appear to him of an intense and visionary quality which he was then able to draw.  Many of these drawings were subsequently enlarged into oil paintings and both were exhibited in 1978 at the AIR (Artist Information Registry) Gallery, then in [[Shaftesbury Avenue]], central London.  This exhibition was a critical success and during the next ten years was followed by several others most notably at the [[Serpentine Gallery]] (1982) and the [[Whitechapel Art Gallery]] (1986), the latter a major retrospective.

In 1982 he was Artist in Residence, [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge|Corpus Christi College]] and [[Kettle's Yard]] art gallery, [[Cambridge]].  His paintings entered important collections including the [[Tate Gallery]], the Arts Council and the [[Saatchi Collection]].  His many drawings were also widely exhibited and collected.  Particularly striking was the series of ''Masks'' which were shown at the [[Hayward Gallery]] Annual (sponsored by the Arts Council) in 1985.

With his increasing disability the large paintings of the earlier eighties gave place to smaller, his last exhibition being of a series of Heads at the Karsten Schubert Gallery in 1987.  Also towards the end of his life he designed and had made some small sculptures, painted and gilded, resembling some of the standing figures in his drawings.  Another idea, surviving in small models, was the creation of the 'aedicola' or 'shelter', a place of refuge or retreat, which had featured in his drawings and paintings.

Willing died at home in [[Hampstead]], north London, on 1 June 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Obituaries: ''The Times'', 2 June; ''The Telegraph'', 2 June 1988&lt;/ref&gt;  In the years since then several important publications and exhibitions have taken place.  In 1993 Karsten Schubert published a selection of his writings and two conversations with John McEwen while in 2000 appeared the August Media multi-authored study of his work.  Five works were included in the 'New Displays' at the Tate Gallery in 1999 and in 2000 there was a solo exhibition of his work at Marlborough Fine Art, London.

In late 2008 the [[Pallant House Gallery]], Chichester exhibited their holdings of his paintings, bequeathed to them by the architect [[Colin St John Wilson]], alongside some loans of early work.  An extensive retrospective exhibition, curated by Helmut Wohl, opened at the Casa das Historias Paula Rego, [[Cascais]], [[Portugal]] on 9 September 2010 and closed on 2 January 2011.

[[File:'The Three Vinegar Tasters' by Kano Isen'in, c. 1802-1816, Honolulu Museum of Art, 6156.1.JPG|thumb|right|Another representation of the theme.]]
'''''The Vinegar Tasters''''' (三酸圖, three sours; 嘗醋翁, vinegar tasting old-men; 嘗醋圖, 尝醋图), is a traditional subject in Chinese religious painting. The [[allegory|allegorical]] composition depicts the three founders of China's major religious and philosophical traditions: [[Confucianism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Taoism]]. The theme in the painting has been interpreted as favoring Taoism and critical of the others.

The three men are dipping their fingers in a vat of [[vinegar]] and tasting it; one man reacts with a sour expression, one reacts with a bitter expression, and one reacts with a sweet expression. The three men are [[Confucius]], [[Buddha]], and [[Laozi]], respectively. Each man's expression represents the predominant attitude of his philosophy: Confucianism saw life as sour, in need of [[Norm (philosophy)|rules]] to correct the degeneration of people; Buddhism saw life as bitter, dominated by pain and suffering; and Taoism saw life as fundamentally good in its natural state. Another interpretation of the [[painting]] is that, since the three men are gathered around one vat of vinegar, the "[[three teachings]]" are one.

The painting and its theme was featured in the book ''[[The Tao of Pooh]]'' by American Taoist writer [[Benjamin Hoff]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taoism.net/sanctuary/books/vintaste.htm An excerpt from ''The Tao of Pooh'' by Benjamin Hoff]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==

===Confucianism===
Confucianism saw life as sour, in need of rules to correct the degeneration of people, and the present was out of step of the past and that the government had no understanding of the way of the universe—the right response was to worship the ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;8)&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucianism, being concerned with the outside world, viewed the vinegar as "polluted wine".

===Buddhism===
Buddhism, as it is practiced today, was heavily influenced and shaped by [[Siddhartha Gautama]], who claimed to be [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightened]] when he was thirty-five years old. Siddhartha lived a very sheltered and extravagant life growing up. As he neared his thirties it is said that he became aware of all the ugliness in the world, this prompted him to leave his home in search of enlightenment. At the start of his travels Siddhartha became a beggar and studied [[philosophy]]; however, his studies did not lead him to the answers that he sought. He then tried [[asceticism]] alongside five [[monk]]s for six years; this practice also failed to bring him enlightenment. After giving up asceticism, Siddhartha decided to [[meditate]] until he found the enlightenment that he was searching for. After much meditation, he became enlightened and was henceforth known as Buddha, which means 'awakened one'. During his meditation he had a vision of humankind and the cycle that we are bound to. He concluded that we are bound to the cycles of life and death because of [[tanha]] ([[desire (emotion)|desire]], thirst, craving). During Buddha's first sermon he preached, "neither the extreme of indulgence nor the extremes of asceticism was acceptable as a way of life and that one should avoid extremes and seek to live in the middle way". "Thus the goal of basic Buddhist practice is not the achievement of a state of bliss in some [[heaven]] but the extinguishing of tanha. When tanha is extinguished, one is released from the cycle of life (birth, suffering, death, and rebirth)",&lt;ref&gt;(Hopfe/Woodward 2007, p. 176)&lt;/ref&gt; only then will they achieve [[Nirvana]].

One interpretation is that Buddhism, being concerned with the self, viewed the vinegar as a polluter of the taster's body due to its extreme flavor. Another interpretation for the image is that Buddhism reports the facts as they are, that vinegar is vinegar and isn't naturally sweet on the tongue. Trying to make it sweet is ignoring what it is, pretending it is sweet is denying what it is, while the equally harmful opposite is being disturbed by the sourness.

===Taoism (Daoism)===
Taoism sees life as fundamentally good in its natural state.

{{Quote|From the Taoist point of view, sourness and bitterness come from the interfering and unappreciative mind. Life itself, when understood and utilized for what it is, is sweet. That is the message of "The Vinegar Tasters".|Benjamin Hoff|''The Tao of Pooh''}}

In the vinegar tasters picture, Laozi's (Lao Tzu) expression is sweet because of how the teachings of Taoism view the world. Every natural thing is intrinsically good as long as it remains true to its nature.  This perspective allows Laozi to experience the taste of vinegar without judging it.  "Ah this," he might be thinking, "this is vinegar!"  From such a perspective, the taste doesn't need to be sweet, sour, bitter or bland.  It is simply the taste of vinegar.  By openly experiencing vinegar as vinegar, Laozi acknowledges and participates in the harmony of nature.  As this is the very goal of Taoism, whatever the taste of vinegar, the experience is good.

At the core of Taoist doctrine is the concept of the Dao or "the way".  According to Taoist philosophy, the universe originates from Tao, and Tao dominates the universe.  "Tao is all embracing, existing anywhere and everywhere though it is invisible.  It gives birth to the universe, which then gives birth to everything in it" (Sang, 87).  The Tao in this sense is the way of the universe, the driving power behind all in nature (Smith, 198).

'''Visual art of the United States''' or '''American art''' is [[visual art]] made in the United States or by U.S. artists. Before colonization there were many flourishing traditions of [[Native American art]], and where the Spanish colonized [[Spanish Colonial architecture]] and the accompanying styles in other media were quickly in place. Early colonial art on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] initially relied on artists from Europe, with [[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] (1540-c. 1593) the earliest example.  In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, artists primarily painted portraits, and some landscapes in a style based mainly on [[Art of the United Kingdom|English painting]].  Furniture-makers imitating English styles and similar craftsmen were also established in the major cities, but in the English colonies, locally made pottery remained [[American Stoneware|resolutely utilitarian]] until the 19th century, with fancy products imported.

But in the later 18th century two U.S. artists, [[Benjamin West]] and [[John Singleton Copley]], became the most successful painters in London of [[history painting]], then regarded as the highest form of art, giving the first sign of an emerging force in [[Western art]].  American artists who remained at home became increasingly skilled, although there was little awareness of them in Europe.  In the early 19th century the infrastructure to train artists began to be established, and from 1820 the [[Hudson River School]] began to produce [[Romanticism|Romantic]] [[landscape painting]] that was original and matched the huge scale of U.S. landscapes.  The [[American Revolution]] produced a demand for patriotic art, especially history painting, while other artists recorded the frontier country.  A parallel development taking shape in rural U.S. was the [[American craft]] movement, which began as a reaction to the [[industrial revolution]].

After 1850 [[Academic art]] in the European style flourished, and as richer Americans became very wealthy, the flow of European art, new and old, to the US began; this has continued ever since.  Museums began to be opened to display much of this. Developments in modern art in Europe came to the U.S. from exhibitions in New York City such as the [[Armory Show]] in 1913. After World War II, New York replaced Paris as the center of the art world. Since then many U.S. movements have shaped [[Modern art|Modern]] and [[Postmodern art]]. Art in the United States today covers a huge range of styles.

==Beginnings==

{{See also|Painting in the Americas before European colonization}}
One of the first painters to visit British America was [[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] (c. 1540 – c. 1606), who made important [[watercolor]] records of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] life on the Eastern seaboard (now [[British Museum]]).  White first visited America as the artist and map-maker for an expedition of exploration, and in the early years of the Colonial period most other artists trained in Western styles were officers in the army and navy, whose training included sketching landscapes.  Eventually the English settlements grew large enough to support professional artists, mostly portrait-painters, often largely self-taught.  Among the earliest was [[John Smybert]] (1688–1751), a trained artist from London who emigrated in 1728 intending to be a professor of fine art, but instead became a portrait painter and printseller in Boston.  His friend [[Peter Pelham]] was a painter and printmaker.  Both needed other sources of income and had shops.  Meanwhile, the Spanish territories later to be American could see mostly religious art in the late [[Baroque]] style, mostly by native artists, and [[Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures continued to produce art in their various traditions.

==Eighteenth century==

After the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in 1776, which marked the official beginning of the American national identity, the new nation needed a history, and part of that history would be expressed visually. Most of early American art (from the late 18th century through the early 19th century) consists of [[history painting]] and especially [[Portrait painting|portraits]]. As in Colonial America, many of the painters who specialized in portraits were essentially self-taught; notable among them are [[Joseph Badger]], [[John Brewster, Jr.]], and [[William Jennys]]. The young nation's artists generally emulated the style of British art, which they knew through [[Old master prints|print]]s and the paintings of English-trained immigrants such as John Smibert (1688–1751) and [[John Wollaston (painter)|John Wollaston]] (active 1742–75).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/cgi-bin/tbio?tperson=1981 National Gallery of Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512111352/http://www.nga.gov/cgi-bin/tbio?tperson=1981 |date=2009-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Feke]] (1707–52), an untrained painter of the colonial period, achieved a sophisticated style based on Smibert's example.&lt;ref&gt;Flexner, James Thomas. ''John Singleton Copley''. Fordham University Press. 1948. p. 20. {{ISBN|0823215237}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Willson Peale]], who gained much of his earliest art training by studying Smibert's copies of European paintings,&lt;ref&gt;Booker Wright, Louis, ''The Arts in America: the colonial period''. Schocken. 1975. p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; painted portraits of many of the important figures of the [[American Revolution]]. Peale's younger brother [[James Peale]] and four of Peale's sons—[[Raphaelle Peale]], [[Rembrandt Peale]], [[Rubens Peale]] and [[Titian Peale]]—were also artists. Painters such as [[Gilbert Stuart]] made portraits of the newly elected government officials,&lt;ref name=gsm&gt;[http://www.gilbertstuartmuseum.com/ Gilbert Stuart Birthplace and Museum]. ''Gilbert Stuart Biography''. Accessed July 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; which became iconic after being reproduced on various U.S. Postage stamps of the 19th century and early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&amp;cmd=1&amp;tid=2027665 Smithsonian National Postal Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Singleton Copley]] painted [[emblem]]atic [[Portrait painting|portraits]] for the increasingly prosperous merchant class, including a portrait of ''[[Paul Revere]]'' (ca. 1768–70). The original version of his most famous painting, ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' (1778), is in the collection of [[The National Gallery of Art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/feature/watson/watsonhome.shtm |title=National Gallery of Art |access-date=2012-06-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701232844/http://www.nga.gov/feature/watson/watsonhome.shtm |archive-date=2012-07-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while there is another version in the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]] and a third version in the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]. [[Benjamin West]] painted portraits as well as history paintings of the [[French and Indian War]]. West also worked in London where many American artists studied under him, including [[Washington Allston]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bwst/hd_bwst.htm Barratt, Carrie Rebora.

The first well-known U.S. school of painting—the [[Hudson River School]]—appeared in 1820. [[Thomas Cole]] pioneered the movement which included [[Albert Bierstadt]], [[Frederic Edwin Church]], [[Thomas Doughty (artist)|Thomas Doughty]] and several others. As with music and literature, this development was delayed until artists perceived that the New World offered subjects unique to itself; in this case the westward expansion of settlement brought the transcendent beauty of frontier landscapes to painters' attention.

The Hudson River painters' directness and simplicity of vision influenced and inspired such later artists as [[John Kensett]] and the ''[[Luminism (American art style)|Luminists]]''; as well as [[George Inness]] and the ''[[Tonalism|tonalists]]'' (which included [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] and [[Ralph Albert Blakelock|Ralph Blakelock]] among others), and [[Winslow Homer]] (1836–1910), who depicted the rural U.S.—the sea, the mountains, and the people who lived near them.

The Hudson River School landscape painter [[Robert S. Duncanson]] was one of the first important [[African American art|African American painters]]. [[John James Audubon]], an [[ornothology|ornothologist]] whose paintings documented birds, was one of the most important naturalist artists in the early U.S. His major work, a set of colored prints entitled ''[[The Birds of America]]'' (1827–1839), is considered one of the finest ornithological works ever completed. [[Edward Hicks]] was a U.S. [[Folk art|folk painter]] and distinguished [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] of the [[Society of Friends]]. He became a Quaker [[Cultural icon|icon]] because of his paintings.

Paintings of the Great West, many of which emphasized the sheer size of the land and the cultures of the native people living on it, became a distinct genre as well. [[George Catlin]] depicted the West and its people as honestly as possible. [[George Caleb Bingham]], and later [[Frederick Remington]], [[Charles M. Russell]], the photographer [[Edward S. Curtis]], and others recorded the U.S. Western heritage and the [[Old American West]] through their art.

[[History painting]] was a less popular genre in U.S. art during the 19th century, although ''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'', painted by the German-born [[Emanuel Leutze]], is among the best-known U.S. paintings. The historical and military paintings of [[William B. T. Trego]] were widely published after his death (according to Edwin A. Peeples, "There is probably not an American History book which doesn't have (a) Trego picture in it").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michenermuseum.org/bucksartists/artist.php?artist=281&amp;page=1191 |title=James A.

Portrait painters in the U.S. in the 19th century included untrained limners such as [[Ammi Phillips]], and painters schooled in the European tradition, such as Thomas Sully and [[George Peter Alexander Healy|G.P.A. Healy]]. Middle-class city life found its painter in [[Thomas Eakins]] (1844–1916), an uncompromising realist whose unflinching honesty undercut the genteel preference for romantic sentimentalism. As a result, he was not notably successful in his lifetime, although he has since been recognized as one of the most significant U.S. artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/3aa/3aa94.htm TFAOI.com]. Philadelphia Museum of Art. Retrieved July 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; One of his students was [[Henry Ossawa Tanner]], the first African-American painter to achieve international acclaim.

A [[trompe-l'oeil]] style of [[still-life]] painting, originating mainly in Philadelphia, included Raphaelle Peale (one of several artists of the Peale family), [[William Michael Harnett]], and [[John F. Peto]].

The most successful U.S. sculptor of his era, [[Hiram Powers]], left the U.S. in his early thirties to spend the rest of his life in Europe, where he adopted a conventional style for his idealized female nudes such as ''Eve Tempted''.&lt;ref&gt;National Museum of American Art (U.S.), &amp; Kloss, W. ''Treasures from the National Museum of American Art''. Washington: National Museum of American Art. 1985. pp. 189–190. {{ISBN|0874745950}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several important painters who are considered American spent much of their lives in Europe, notably [[Mary Cassatt]], [[James McNeill Whistler]], and [[John Singer Sargent]], all of whom were influenced by French [[Impressionism]]. [[Theodore Robinson]] visited France in 1887, befriended [[Claude Monet|Monet]], and became one of the first U.S. painters to adopt the new technique. In the last decades of the century [[American Impressionism]], as practiced by artists such as [[Childe Hassam]] and [[Frank Weston Benson|Frank W. Benson]], became a popular style.

{{main article|American realism|American modernism}}
Controversy soon became a way of life for American artists. In fact, much of American painting and sculpture since 1900 has been a series of revolts against tradition. "To hell with the artistic values," announced [[Robert Henri]] (1865–1929). He was the leader of what critics called the [[Ashcan school]] of painting, after the group's portrayals of the squalid aspects of city life.

[[American realism]] became the new direction for American visual artists at the turn of the 20th century. The Ashcan painters [[George Bellows]], [[Everett Shinn]], [[George Benjamin Luks]], [[William Glackens]], and [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]] were among those who developed socially conscious imagery in their works. The photographer [[Alfred Stieglitz]] (1864–1946) led the [[Photo-Secession]] movement, which created pathways for photography as an emerging art form.

Soon the Ashcan school artists gave way to [[Modernism|modernists]] arriving from Europe—the cubists and abstract painters promoted by Stieglitz at his [[291 Gallery]] in New York City. [[John Marin]], [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Alfred Henry Maurer]], [[Arthur B. Carles]], [[Arthur Dove]], [[Henrietta Shore]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], [[Wilhelmina Weber Furlong|Wilhelmina Weber]], [[Stanton MacDonald-Wright]], [[Morgan Russell]], [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Andrew Dasburg]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], and [[Gerald Murphy]] were some important early American modernist painters. Early modernist sculptors in America include [[William Zorach]], [[Elie Nadelman]], and [[Paul Manship]]. [[Florine Stettheimer]] developed an extremely personal faux-naif style.

After [[World War I]] many American artists rejected the [[modern art|modern]] trends emanating from the [[Armory Show]] and European influences such as those from the [[School of Paris]]. Instead they chose to adopt various—in some cases [[Academic art|academic]]—styles of [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] in depicting American urban and rural scenes. [[Grant Wood]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], [[Guy Pène du Bois]], and [[Charles Sheeler]] exemplify the realist tendency in different ways. Sheeler and the modernists [[Charles Demuth]] and [[Ralston Crawford]] were referred to as [[Precisionism|Precisionists]] for their sharply defined renderings of machines and architectural forms. [[Edward Hopper]], who studied under Henri, developed an individual style of realism by concentrating on light and form, and avoiding overt social content.

===The American Southwest===
[[File:O'Keeffe Georgia Ram's Head.jpg|thumb|right|[[Georgia O'Keeffe]], ''Ram's Head White Hollyhock and Little Hills,'' 1935, the [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
{{Main article|Art of the American Southwest|Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas#Southwest}}

Following the [[first World War]], the completion of the [[Santa Fe Railroad]] enabled American settlers to travel across the west, as far as the [[California]] coast. New artists' colonies started growing up around [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]], the artists' primary subject matter being the native people and landscapes of the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]].

Images of the Southwest became a popular form of advertising, used most significantly by the Santa Fe Railroad to entice settlers to come west and enjoy the "unsullied landscapes." [[Walter Ufer]], [[Bert Geer Phillips]], [[E. Irving Couse]], [[William Henry Jackson]], [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Andrew Dasburg]], and [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] were some of the more prolific artists of the Southwest. Georgia O'Keeffe, who was born in the late 19th century, became known for her paintings featuring flowers, bones, and landscapes of [[New Mexico]] as seen in ''Ram's Head White Hollyhock and Little Hills''. O'Keeffe visited the Southwest in 1929 and moved there permanently in 1949; she lived and painted there until she died in 1986.

===Harlem Renaissance (1920s-1930s)===
{{See also|African American art|List of African American visual artists}}
The [[Harlem Renaissance]] was another significant development in American art. In the 1920s and 30s a new generation of educated and politically astute African-American men and women emerged who sponsored literary societies and art and industrial exhibitions to combat racist stereotypes. The movement, which showcased the range of talents within African-American communities, included artists from across America, but was centered in [[Harlem]]. The work of the Harlem painter and [[graphic art]]ist [[Aaron Douglas]] and the photographer [[James VanDerZee]] became emblematic of the movement. Artists associated with the Harlem Renaissance include [[Romare Bearden]], [[Jacob Lawrence]], [[Charles Alston]], [[Augusta Savage]], [[Archibald Motley]], [[Lois Mailou Jones]], [[Palmer Hayden]] and [[Sargent Johnson]].

===New Deal art (1930s)===

When the [[Great Depression]] hit, president [[Franklin D Roosevelt|Roosevelt's]] [[New Deal]] created several public arts programs. The purpose of the programs was to give work to artists and decorate public buildings, usually with a national theme. The first of these projects, the [[Public Works of Art Project]] (PWAP), was created after successful lobbying by the unemployed artists of the [[Artists Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpamurals.com/history.html History of the New Deal Art Projects]&lt;/ref&gt; The PWAP lasted less than one year, and produced nearly 15,000 works of art. It was followed by the [[Federal Art Project]] of the [[Works Progress Administration]] (FAP/WPA) in 1935, which funded some of the most well-known [[List of American artists|American artists]].&lt;ref name = "arnesen"&gt;Eric Arnesen, ed. ''Encyclopedia of U.S. labor and working-class history'' (2007) vol. 1 p. 1540&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of much of the public art commissioned by the WPA was influenced by the work of [[Diego Rivera]] and other artists of the contemporary [[Mexican muralism]] movement. Several separate and related movements began and developed during the [[Great Depression]] including [[American scene painting]], [[Regionalism (art)|Regionalism]], and [[Social Realism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10195 MoMA, The Collection, Social Realism]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Grant Wood]], [[Maxine Albro]], [[Ben Shahn]], [[Joseph Stella]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], [[Isaac Soyer]], [[Raphael Soyer]], [[Spencer Baird Nichols]] and [[Jack Levine]] were some of the best-known artists.

Not all of the artists who emerged in the years between the wars were Regionalists or Social Realists; [[Milton Avery]]'s paintings, often nearly abstract, had a significant influence on several of the younger artists who would soon become known as Abstract Expressionists.&lt;ref&gt;Chernow, Bert.

Miami, Florida: Trustees of the Center for the Fine Arts Association. 1987. p. 8. {{OCLC|19128732}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Cornell]], inspired by [[Surrealism]], created boxed assemblages incorporating found objects and [[collage]].

In the years after World War II, a group of New York artists formed the first American movement to exert major influence internationally: [[abstract expressionism]].
This term, which had first been used in 1919 in Berlin, was used again in 1946 by [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'', and was taken up by the two major art critics of that time, [[Harold Rosenberg]] and [[Clement Greenberg]]. It has always been criticized as too large and paradoxical, yet the common definition implies the use of [[abstract art]] to express feelings, emotions, what is within the artist, and not what stands without.

The first generation of abstract expressionists included [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Phillip Guston]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[William Baziotes]], [[Mark Tobey]], [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]], [[Theodoros Stamos]], [[Jack Tworkov]], [[Wilhelmina Weber Furlong]], [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], and [[Hans Hofmann]], among others. [[Milton Avery]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Morris Graves]] and others were also related, important and influential artists during that period.

Though the numerous artists encompassed by this label had widely different styles, contemporary critics found several common points between them. Gorky, Pollock, de Kooning, Kline, Hofmann, Motherwell, Gottlieb, Rothko, Still, Guston, and others were an American painters associated with the [[Abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]] movement and in most cases [[Action painting]] (as seen in Kline's ''Painting Number 2'', 1954); as part of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] in the 1940s and 1950s.

Many first generation abstract expressionists were influenced both by the [[Cubist]]s' works (which they knew from photographs in art reviews and by seeing the works at the 291 Gallery or the Armory Show), by the European [[Surrealist]]s, and by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Joan Miró]] and [[Henri Matisse]] as well as the Americans [[Milton Avery]], [[John D. Graham]], and [[Hans Hofmann]]. Most of them abandoned formal composition and representation of real objects. Often the abstract expressionists decided to try instinctual, intuitive, spontaneous arrangements of space, line, shape and color. Abstract Expressionism can be characterized by two major elements: the large size of the canvases used (partially inspired by Mexican frescoes and the works they made for the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] in the 1930s), and the strong and unusual use of brushstrokes and experimental paint application with a new understanding of process.

====Color Field painting====
The emphasis and intensification of color and large open expanses of surface were two of the principles applied to the movement called [[Color Field]] painting. Ad Reinhardt, Adolph Gottlieb, Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still and Barnett Newman were categorized as such. Another movement was called [[Action Painting]], characterized by spontaneous reaction, powerful brushstrokes, dripped and splashed paint and the strong physical movements used in the production of a painting. Jackson Pollock is an example of an Action Painter: his ''creative process'', incorporating thrown and dripped paint from a stick or poured directly from the can, revolutionized painting methods.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 1'', Grolier Incorporated, Jan 1, 1999, p. 56, {{ISBN|0717201317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Willem de Kooning]] famously said about Pollock "he broke the ice for the rest of us."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=cQBt2GVDQTcC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=de+Kooning,+Pollock+he+broke+the+ice+for+the+rest+of+us&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7_9aziJ_bAhUB3iwKHe65BiYQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=de%20Kooning%2C%20Pollock%20he%20broke%20the%20ice%20for%20the%20rest%20of%20us&amp;f=false Carolyn Lanchner, ''Jasper Johns'', The Museum of Modern Art], New York, N.Y., 2009, p. 20, {{ISBN|087070768X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically Pollock's large repetitious expanses of linear fields are characteristic of Color Field painting as well, as [[art critic]] [[Michael Fried]] wrote in his essay for the catalog of ''Three American painters: [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Frank Stella]]'' at the [[Fogg Art Museum]] in 1965.
Despite the disagreements between art critics, Abstract Expressionism marks a turning-point in the history of American art: the 1940s and 1950s saw international attention shift from European (Parisian) art, to American (New York) art.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=DABQAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=the+1940s+and+1950s+saw+international+attention+shift+from+European+(Parisian)+art,+to+American+(New+York)+art&amp;dq=the+1940s+and+1950s+saw+international+attention+shift+from+European+(Parisian)+art,+to+American+(New+York)+art&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUiaq0iZ_bAhWCFywKHcx8AOgQ6AEIMzAC Paul Cummings, ''American Drawings: the 20th Century''], Viking Press, University of Michigan, 1976, {{ISBN|0670117846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Color field painting continued as a movement in the 1960s, as Morris Louis, Jules Olitski, Kenneth Noland, Gene Davis, [[Helen Frankenthaler]], and others sought to make paintings which would eliminate superfluous rhetoric with repetition, stripes and large, flat areas of color.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/documents/moma_catalogue_1945_300299009.pdf William S. Rubin, ''Frank Stella''], The Museum of Modern Art, Distributed by New York Graphic Society, Greenwich, CT, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

===After abstract expressionism===
[[File:RothkoBlackGray.jpg|thumb|[[Mark Rothko]], ''[[Untitled (Black on Grey)]],'' 1970, [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], [[New York City]]. One of Rothko's final paintings which relate closely to both [[Minimal art]] and [[Color Field painting]].]]

During the 1950s abstract painting in America evolved into movements such as [[Neo-Dada]], [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op Art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[Shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and the continuation of [[Abstract expressionism]]. As a response to the tendency toward abstraction imagery emerged through various new movements like [[Pop Art]], the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] and later in the 1970s [[Neo-expressionism]].

Lyrical Abstraction along with the [[Fluxus]] movement and [[Postminimalism]] (a term first coined by Robert Pincus-Witten in the pages of ''[[Artforum]]'' in 1969)&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, [[Art &amp; Auction|Art+Auction]], March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt; sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and Minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression. Postminimalism often incorporating industrial materials, raw materials, fabrications, found objects, installation, serial repetition, and often with references to [[Dada]] and Surrealism is best exemplified in the sculptures of [[Eva Hesse]].&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"/&gt;

Lyrical Abstraction, [[Conceptual Art]], Postminimalism, [[Earth Art]], [[Video]], [[Performance art]], [[Installation art]], along with the continuation of Fluxus, Abstract Expressionism, [[Color Field]] Painting, Hard-edge painting, [[Minimal Art]], Op art, [[Pop Art]], [[Photorealism]] and [[New Realism]] extended the boundaries of [[Contemporary Art]] in the mid-1960s through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker. The New Art: It's Way, Way Out, [[Newsweek]] July 29, 1968: pp.3,55-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyrical Abstraction shares similarities with Color Field Painting and Abstract Expressionism, especially in the freewheeling usage of paint texture and surface. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in Abstract Expressionism and Color Field Painting. However the styles are markedly different.&lt;ref name="Aldrich, Larry 1969, pp.104–113"&gt;Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v.57, n6, November–December 1969, pp.104–113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qOYCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA64 Thomas B. Hess on Larry Aldrich], Retrieved June 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s painters as powerful and influential as Adolph Gottlieb, [[Phillip Guston]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Al Held]], [[Sam Francis]], Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], [[Paul Jenkins (painter)|Paul Jenkins]] and younger artists like [[Brice Marden]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Sam Gilliam]], [[Sean Scully]], [[Elizabeth Murray (born 1940)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Ross Bleckner]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Julian Schnabel]], [[Peter Halley]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Eric Fischl]] and dozens of others produced vital and influential paintings.

===Other modern American movements===

[[File:Nighthawks by Edward Hopper 1942.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) by [[Edward Hopper]] is one of his best-known works, [[Art Institute of Chicago]].]]
Members of the next artistic generation favored a different form of abstraction: works of mixed media. Among them were [[Robert Rauschenberg]] (1925–2008) and [[Jasper Johns]] (1930- ), who used photos, newsprint, and discarded objects in their compositions. [[Pop art]]ists, such as [[Andy Warhol]] (1928–1987), [[Larry Rivers]] (1923–2002), and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] (1923–1997), reproduced, with satiric care, everyday objects and images of American popular culture—Coca-Cola bottles, soup cans, comic strips.

Realism has also been continually popular in the United States, despite modernism's impact; the realist tendency is evident in the city scenes of [[Edward Hopper]], the rural imagery of [[Andrew Wyeth]], and the illustrations of [[Norman Rockwell]]. In certain places Abstract Expressionism never caught on; for example, in Chicago, the dominant art style was grotesque, symbolic realism, as exemplified by the [[Chicago Imagists]] [[Cosmo Campoli]] (1923–1997), [[Jim Nutt]] (1938- ), [[Ed Paschke]] (1939–2004), and [[Nancy Spero]] (1926–2009).

===Contemporary art into the 21st century===
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;
{{Main article|Contemporary art|Postmodern art|Late Modernism|Neo-conceptual art}}

At the beginning of the 21st century, contemporary art in the United States in general continues in several contiguous modes, characterized by the idea of [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]]. The "crisis" in painting and current art and current [[art criticism]] today is brought about by [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]]. There is no consensus, nor need there be, as to a representative style of the age. There is an ''anything goes'' attitude that prevails; an "everything going on" syndrome; with no firm and clear direction and yet with every lane on the artistic [[superhighway]] filled to capacity. Consequently, magnificent and important works of art continue to be made in the United States albeit in a wide variety of styles and aesthetic temperaments, the marketplace being left to judge merit.

[[Hard-edge painting]], [[Geometric abstraction]], [[Appropriation (art)|Appropriation]], [[Hyperrealism]], [[Photorealism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Minimalism]], [[Lyrical Abstraction]], Pop art, Op art, Abstract Expressionism, Color Field painting, [[Monochrome painting]], [[Neo-expressionism]], [[Collage]], [[Intermedia]] painting, [[Assemblage (art)|Assemblage]] painting, [[Digital painting]], [[Postmodern]] painting, Neo-Dada painting, [[Shaped canvas]] painting, environmental [[mural painting]], [[Graffiti]], traditional [[figure painting]], [[Landscape painting]], [[Portrait painting]], are a few continuing and current directions in painting at the beginning of the 21st century.
