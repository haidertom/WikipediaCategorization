'''Achilles on Skyros''' is an episode in the myth of [[Achilles]], a Greek hero of the [[Trojan War]]. Not existing in [[Homer]]'s [[epic poem]] ''[[Iliad]]'', the episode is written down in detail in some later versions of the story, particularly the ''[[Achilleid]]'' by the Roman poet [[Statius]]. The story of how Achilles disguised himself as a girl at the court of the king of [[Skyros]], fell in love with one of the princesses, and married her before leaving for Troy, became a popular topic in arts and literature from [[Classical antiquity|Classical times]] until the middle of the 20th century. The carnavalesque disguises and gender transpositions at the heart of the story were particularly popular in opera, with over 30 different operas on the theme between 1641 and 1857.

==Story==
[[File:Hanbury Hall staircase - finding of Achilles.JPG|left|thumb|[[Odysseus]] finds [[Achilles]] among the daughters of Lycomedes. This [[mural]] painting by [[James Thornhill]] commands the main staircase at Hanbury Hall, Worcestershire.]]

The core myth of Achilles on Skyros as presented in ancient sources was thus. Rather than allow her son Achilles to die at Troy as prophesied, the nymph [[Thetis]] sent him to live at the court of [[Lycomedes]], king of [[Skyros]], disguised as another daughter of the king or as a lady-in-waiting, under the name Pyrrha "the red-haired", Issa, or Kerkysera. There Achilles had an affair with [[Deidamia (mythology)|Deidamia]], one of the daughters of Lycomedes, and they had one or two sons, [[Neoptolemus]] and Oneiros.&lt;ref&gt;Oneiros is only mentioned by [[Ptolemy Hephaestion]] (New History Book 3, summarized in [[Photius]], ''Bibliotheca'', 190); generally, all sources speak of one son, Neoptolemus&lt;/ref&gt; Since another prophecy suggested that the Trojan War would not be won without Achilles, [[Odysseus]] and several other [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]] leaders went to Skyros to find him. Odysseus discovered Achilles by offering gifts, adornments and musical instruments as well as weapons, to the king's daughters, and then having his companions imitate the noises of an enemy's attack on the island (most notably, making a blast of a trumpet heard), which prompted Achilles to reveal himself by picking a weapon to fight back, and together they departed for the Trojan War. In some versions, Deidamia dressed as a man followed him.&lt;ref name=Hagedorn&gt;{{cite book|last=Hagedorn|first=Suzanne C.|title=Abandoned Women: Rewriting the Classics in Dante, Boccaccio, and Chaucer|year=2003|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472113491|pages=232|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iaMd1aVMRG4C&amp;pg=PA58&amp; |accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Armas&gt;{{cite book|last=De Armas|first=Frederick Alfred|title=A Star-Crossed Golden Age: Myth and the Spanish Comedia|year=1998|publisher=Bucknell University Press|isbn=9780838753767|pages=247|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0r6nQYoPCOQC&amp;pg=PA116&amp; |accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most detailed and elaborate version is that found in the Roman poem ''Achilleid''.&lt;ref&gt;Book 1, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; In the poem, Thetis resolves to hide Achilles away at the court of Lycomedes. Achilles is quite reluctant, but eventually consents, attracted by the beauty of the king's most fair daughter, Deidamia. Thetis has him dressed up as a maiden and introduces him to Lycomedes as her daughter who would have had an [[Amazons|Amazon]]-like upbringing and now needed to learn feminine ways by living among ordinary girls of her age, so as to prepare for a normal marriage in the future; Lycomedes agrees to take care of the "girl" and his unsuspecting daughters accept Achilles into their company as another fellow maiden. After some time he develops a particularly close friendship with Deidamia and it becomes increasingly difficult for him to hide his romantic and sexual interest in her. Eventually, at a nighttime festival in honor of [[Dionysus]] where men are normally not allowed, Achilles gives way to his manly desires and forces Deidamia to have sex with him. Afterwards, trying to console her, he discloses his true name and origin; despite being scared by what has happened, Deidamia doesn't want Achilles to suffer punishment from her father and resolves to keep the incident and his identity, as well as the fact that she has conceived a child, a secret. When Odysseus and his comrades arrive at Scyros, Achilles, long annoyed by his female disguise, is about to reveal himself but Deidamia holds him back. Odysseus then performs the trick with the gifts and the trumpet and thereby reveals the secret. Achilles hears Deidamia cry and confesses to Lycomedes that they have become lovers and have had a child together. As the Achaeans are about to sail off to the war, Deidamia is heartbroken over the impending loss of Achilles and asks if she could go with him, but that seems impossible; she then implores him to keep their son in his thoughts, and to never have children with other women. Achilles swears to one day return to Deidamia, but the readers are apparently supposed to be aware that he is going to die at Troy.

==Artistic renditions==
[[File:Poussin - 1656 - Achilles on Skyros.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Achilles on Skyros'', 1656 painting by [[Nicolas Poussin]], now in the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]]]]
This part of the Trojan War myths has been the subject of many works of art throughout the centuries. Taken from the point of view of Achilles, Deidamia, or a neutral observer, a number of themes have received attention in the later artwork and stories, ranging from the comical aspects of crossdressing and the misunderstandings it involves, over gender differences, heroism, homosexual and heterosexual love, and initiation rites, to rape, incest, and domestic violence.&lt;ref name=Armas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Callen King|first=Catherine|title=Subversive Subjects: Reading Marguerite Yourcenar|year=2004|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=9780838639924|pages=252|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SXjn7Yz756EC&amp;pg=PA39 |accessdate=9 October 2012|chapter=Achilles on the Field of Sexual Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most later versions go essentially back to the 1st century CE version of [[Statius]], the story of Achilles on Skyros was known earlier than this. There are references to artworks by [[Polygnotus]] and [[Athenion of Maroneia]], and a now lost 5th century BCE play by [[Euripides]].&lt;ref name=Shecktor&gt;{{cite book|last=Shecktor|first=Nina Maria|title=The Achillean Hero in the Plays of Tirso De Molina|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9780820433103|pages=127|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C61PS1YuTtIC&amp;pg=PA42 |accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest and best studied [[Renaissance]] versions of the story was [[Tirso de Molina]]'s 1612 play ''El Aquiles''.&lt;ref name=Armas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shecktor/&gt;&lt;ref name=Puccio&gt;{{cite book|last=DiPuccio|first=Denise M.|title=Communicating Myths of the Golden Age Comedia|year=1998|publisher=Bucknell University Press|isbn=9780838753729|pages=236|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34TXDx6cBTIC&amp;pg=PA117 |accessdate=10 October 2012|chapter=''El Aquiles'' and the Making of a Hero}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by a number of other Spanish plays on the same topic. One of its foci was the change in Achilles from fleeing war to being a war hero. This was emphasized by the many changes and transformations used in the play. But the more typical themes of gender confusion and homosexual love are also apparent, and strengthened by the indication that the role of Achilles should be played by a woman.&lt;ref name=Puccio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stroud|first=Matthew D.|title=Plot Twists and Critical Turns: Queer Approaches to Early Modern Spanish Theater|year=2007|publisher=Bucknell University Press|isbn=9780838756690|pages=267|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S_fLVbXfmZwC&amp;pg=PA117 |accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan de Bray, Achilles wśród córek Likomedesa (Owidiusz, Metamorfozy).jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Achilles discovered by Ulysses'' by [[Jan de Bray]], now in the [[National Museum, Warsaw]]]]
It has often been used as the theme for an opera or ballet, with the libretto by [[Metastasio]] as the most popular. The first opera based on this story seems to have been ''[[La finta pazza]]'' by [[Francesco Sacrati]], with a libretto by [[Giulio Strozzi]]. It was the first and probably the most popular opera of the seventeenth century. It was first performed at the inauguration in 1641 of the [[Teatro Novissimo]] in [[Venice]], the first time ever a building was created specifically to perform operas. [[Anna Renzi]] was the main singer. The production then was performed many times all over Italy and abroad, including a 1645 performance in Paris, which was the second time ever that an opera was staged in France.&lt;ref name=Transvestite/&gt;

The Metastasio libretto was first used for an opera in 1736 by [[Antonio Caldara]], at the occasion of the marriage of [[Maria Theresa]] with the future Holy Roman Emperor, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]]. Due to the short notice given for the marriage, the libretto was finished after only 18 days, compared to the three months Metastasio usually needed. Despite this, it enjoyed a reasonable success and was used for decades, set to music by at least 29 composers.

The popularity of the theme was due to a number of factors, but a major part was the aspect of disguises and crossdressing, with Achilles dressed as a girl and his role often performed by women. Some librettists, especially the earlier ones like [[Giulio Strozzi]], [[Carlo Capece]] and [[Ippolito Bentivoglio]] approached this from a [[carnivalesque]] point of view, emphasizing the comedy, the masquerade and the (homo-)erotic aspects of it. Others like Metastasio or [[Paolo Rolli]] more focused on the failed struggle to conceal the masculinity of the archetypical hero Achilles, and how the inherent nature of the person is stronger than the [[Nature versus nurture|nurture]] he receives.&lt;ref name=Transvestite&gt;{{cite book|last=Heslin|first=P.

Well known composers writing an opera on this theme include [[Domenico Scarlatti]] with his 1712 ''Tetide in Sciro'', [[John Gay]]'s 1733 ''Achilles'', and [[Georg Friedrich Händel]] in 1741 with ''[[Deidamia (opera)|Deidamia]].&lt;ref name=Transvestite/&gt;

'''''Among Gnomes and Trolls''''' ({{Lang-sv|Bland [[tomte|tomtar]] och [[troll]]}}), is a popular [[Sweden|Swedish]] folklore and fairy tales annual and children's fairy tale anthology published since 1907. One of the most noted of the early illustrators is artist [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]].

The first four volumes were illustrated by [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]]. Volume 5 (1911) was illustrated by Norwegian illustrator Louis Moe, after which Bauer resumed illustrating from 1912 to 1915 (volumes 6-9). 1916 had no issue, but the series continues in 1917, illustrated by Aina Masolle and Gustaf Tengren, marking the series' first woman illustrator. From 1918 to 1926 Gustaf Tenggren was the sole illustrator. Between 1927 and 1980, [[Einar Norelius]] was the chief illustrator. Among the writers were authors such as [[Hjalmar Bergman]], [[Helena Nyblom]], [[Margareta Ekström]], [[Gösta Knutsson]] and [[Edith Unnerstad]].&lt;ref name=Museum /&gt;

Several books with extracts from the original volumes illustrated by John Bauer have been published. The first one was published in 1931 to raise money for a memorial honouring Bauer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bauer|first=John|title=John Bauers bästa: ett urval sagor ur Bland tomtar och troll åren 1907–1915|date=1931|publisher=Åhlén &amp; Åkerlund|location=Stockholm|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/john-bauers-basta-ett-urval-sagor-ur-bland-tomtar-och-troll-aren-1907-1915/oclc/492479986|accessdate=February 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13920">Crusader Art is mainly viewed as a mixture of western and eastern art traditions which is due primarily to many different backgrounds of the artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Lucy-Anne|date=1991|title=Art and Colonialism: The Mosaics of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem (1169) and the Problem of "Crusader" Art|jstor=1291693|journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers|volume=45|pages=69–85|doi=10.2307/1291693}}&lt;/ref&gt; It spanned two artistic periods in Europe, the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and the [[Gothic art|Gothic]], but in the [[Crusader kingdoms]] of the [[Levant]] the Gothic style barely appeared.  The military crusaders themselves were mostly not noticeably interested in artistic matters, or sophisticated in their taste, and much of their art was destroyed in the loss of their kingdoms so that only a few pieces survive today.  Probably their most notable and influential artistic achievement was the [[Crusader castle]]s, many of which achieve a stark, massive beauty. They developed the [[Byzantine]] methods of city-fortification for stand-alone [[castle]]s far larger than any constructed before, either locally or in Europe.

The crusaders encountered a long and rich artistic tradition in the lands they conquered at the end of the 11th century and the beginning of the 12th. [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Islamic art]] (that of both the [[Arabs]] and the [[Seljuk Turks|Turks]]) were the dominant styles in the [[Crusader states]], although there were also the styles of the indigenous [[Demographics of Syria|Syrians]] and [[Armenians]]. These indigenous styles were incorporated into styles brought by the crusaders from Europe, which were themselves highly varied, stemming from [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[England]], and elsewhere. On the whole the Eastern Christian styles were more significant influences than Islamic art; the artists working in the Crusader lands are assumed to have had the same variety of backgrounds.

Crusader art, like the history of the Crusader kingdoms in general, falls clearly into two, or three, periods.  The first begins with the [[First Crusade]] which culminated in 1099 with the bloody [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|taking of Jerusalem]] and the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and other states to the north. In the second period the Kingdom of Jerusalem was now hugely reduced in size to control only a few coastal towns and the areas around them, which were gradually whittled away by the Muslims until the final [[Siege of Acre (1291)]] ended Crusader presence in the [[Levant]]. The third period of Crusader art, which is not counted as such by all sources, is often found in Cyprus in the Gothic style.&lt;ref&gt;Folda restricts himself to the art of the "[[Holy Land]]" or "Syria-Palestine", Folda, I, 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically Crusader Art falls into two categories; the artist creates art in their native style and ignore their new surroundings, or they try to copy the Byzantine style so precisely that their nationality is almost indiscernible.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weitzmann|first=Kurt|date=1966|title=Icon Painting in the Crusader Kingdom|jstor=1291242|journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers|volume=20|pages=49–83|doi=10.2307/1291242}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Melisende-Psalter f9v.jpg|thumb|right|305x305px|''the Harrowing of Hell'' from the [[Melisende Psalter]]]]

== Illuminated Manuscripts ==
An illuminated manuscript is a manuscript that has some painted design on it whether it be a small picture or a border or even just initials. An example of the mixture of different styles is the [[Melisende Psalter]], an [[illuminated manuscript]]; the Psalter was commissioned by Queen [[Melisende of Jerusalem]] between 1131 and 1143 and contains many miniatures.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; It reflects her European and Armenian heritage, and is also influenced by Byzantine and Islamic techniques. The [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in [[Egypt]] was an important centre where a school of manuscript and [[icon]] painting that blended European and local influences emerged. Unfortunately many of the manuscripts were destroyed.  Artists who can be identified on stylistic grounds as originating in [[France]] and [[Italy]] ([[Venice]] and [[Apulia]]) worked there, producing work mixing Byzantine and Western conventions, but usually with lettering in Greek. There was also a scriptorium in Acre which produced many well known manuscripts such as Missals and Arsenal bibles.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Another example of Crusader Art manuscripts would be the Last Judgement miniatures from an eleventh century Gospel book and similar Last Judgement miniatures in an Armenian Gospel book painted by T'oros Roslin in 1262.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Many of the manuscripts that are crusader style manuscripts were commissioned by King Louis IX, especially in the city of Acre.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/229033386|title=Crusader art : the art of the Crusaders in the Holy Land, 1099-1291|last=Jaroslav.|first=Folda,|date=2008|publisher=Lund Humphries|isbn=9780853319955|location=Aldershot|oclc=229033386}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of an illuminated manuscript that was commissioned by King Louis IX and is a result of crusader art is the frontispiece of Proverbs 1 in the Arsenal Bible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This manuscript shows Solomon wearing the traditional insignia and clothing of a Byzantine emperor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This illumination is a mixture of the Gothic and Franco-Byzantine Crusader styles, and also showcases French architecture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; More manuscripts done in a similar style to the Arsenal Bible include a few Missals, and a Psalter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Most of the significant surviving illuminated manuscripts were produced in the 13th century, about half in the last forty years of the Latin kingdom; to what extent this is an accident of survival is unclear.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Mosaics, Frescoes and Panel Paintings==
[[File:Israel Abu Ghosh BW 4.JPG|thumb|left|Frescos at [[Abu Ghosh]].]]Another example of the mixture of styles is the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in Jerusalem, the renovation and rebuilding of which was completed in 1149; however only fragments of the large programme of [[mosaic]]s now survive. A mosaic is a type of art that uses of glass shards, tiles or small pebbles in order to create a picture. Some icons in wall painting and mosaic survive from the [[Church of the Nativity]] in [[Bethlehem]].&lt;ref&gt;Folda, I, 28&lt;/ref&gt;  A very well known Crusader Art mosaic is the Torcello mosaic of the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Hospitaller]] church at [[Abu Ghosh]], apparently then regarded as the biblical [[Emmaus]], was abandoned in 1187 but has good remains of [[fresco]]s. A fresco is a type of mural that was painted on a freshly plastered wall. An example of a Crusader Art Fresco would be the Last Judgement fresco in Vladimir which has been dated to the end of the twelfth century.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Another example of some Crusader Art frescoes are the frescoes at Lagoudhera on the island of Cyprus.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Panel paintings are paintings that were on a flat piece of wood which made moving them around possible. Some examples of panel paintings would include the panels containing busts of John the Baptist and Saint Andrew, which has a face that is so detailed with highlights and sharp lines that it seems almost ornamental when compared to other examples of Crusader Art.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Another example would be the diptych of King Andrew the Third of Hungary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A painting with many examples of Crusader Art would be an iconostasis beam that contains: Virgin of the Crucifixion, the Pentecost and Birth of Christ combined with the Adoration of the Magi.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Sculpture==
[[File:Church of the Annunciation Crusaders Capital 200704.JPG|thumb|left|Capital from the [[Basilica of the Annunciation|Church of the Annunciation]] in [[Nazareth]] - (?) one of those buried in 1187]]
Figurative [[monumental sculpture]] in [[relief]] was, some earlier Armenian work apart, not part of local Christian traditions, so the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] sculpture of Europe, especially France, was much the largest influence.  Discussion of the varied styles by art historians typically involves only various areas in Europe, mostly in France.  Many elements were re-used in later buildings, and have now re-appeared, often badly damaged. Original work has survived at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, whose carved [[lintel]]s are now in the [[Rockefeller Museum]] in the city, and was removed from the destroyed Church of Santa Maria Latina nearby.

Another major pilgrimage basilica, the [[Basilica of the Annunciation|Church of the Annunciation]] in [[Nazareth]], was just nearing the completion of a major rebuilding in 1187. Saladin in fact left the Christians in place and does not seem to have damaged the building. However the church was seriously damaged in the next major upheaval in the area, the invasion in 1267 by the [[Mamluk]] ruler [[Baybars]], and the sculptures remaining from the church all suffered.  In 1908 five extra capitals were excavated, having, it is presumed, been buried in 1187 soon after they were made but before they were put in place, when news of Saladin's approach reached the town.  These are in excellent condition, and some of the most famous sculptures of the Crusader period.&lt;ref&gt;Folda, I, 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation is rather different with decorative sculpture, where local influence is much stronger.  The beautifully carved and complex decoration on the arches and cornices over the doors into the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is unlike anything in France from this period and reflects local development of Syrian late Roman styles; some parts are probably re-used Roman material.  The neighbouring capitals, "based on [[Justinian the Great|Justinianic]] models, are probably the work of local Christian sculptors working for the Latins".&lt;ref&gt;Setton and Hazard, 270&lt;/ref&gt;

==The End of Crusader Art==

After the rapid collapse of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] in 1187, which must have destroyed a great part of the artwork the crusaders produced,&lt;ref&gt;discussed in detail at Folda, I, 23-28&lt;/ref&gt; they were mostly confined to a few cities on the [[Mediterranean]] coast until [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] was conquered in 1291. Their artistic output did not cease during the 13th century, and shows further influences from the art of the [[Mamluk]]s and [[Mongols]].

In Cyprus, the Lusignan kingdom continued to produce work, including the Gothic cathedrals of [[Famagusta]] ([[Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque]]) and [[Nicosia]] ([[Haydarpasha Mosque]]/Saint Catherine and [[Selimiye Mosque (Nicosia)|Selimiye Mosque]]/Saint Sophia Cathedral), all later used as [[mosque]]s and relatively well-preserved (minus their figurative sculpture).

== Influences on Europe ==
There was also crusade-related art produced back in Europe, from the many illuminated crusade chronicles such as the [[Old French]] translation of [[William of Tyre]], to architecture such as the round churches built by the [[Knights Templar]] in the style of the Holy Sepulchre, and the [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris built to accommodate relics brought back from the East.  Luxurious printed textiles began to be produced in Europe at around the end of the Crusades, and may well have been another influence. In general, it is often not possible to say with certainty whether influences or new types of objects arriving in Europe at this period did so via Islamic Spain, the Byzantine world, or the Crusader states. Historians tend to discount the importance of the Crusader States in this regard, despite the very well developed Italian trading networks there. European [[castle]]-building was certainly decisively influenced by the crusaders.

[[Image:Hryhory Bazhul.jpg|thumb|150px|Kharkiv bandurist H. Bazhul]]
A '''banduryst''' ({{lang-uk|бандури́ст}}) is a person who plays the [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[plucked string instrument]] known as the [[bandura]].

==Types of performers==
There are a number of different types of bandurist who differ in their particular choice of instrument, the specific repertoire they play and manner in which they approach their vocation.

*'''[[Kobzar]]i''', who play authentic ethnographic instruments or copies. This group can also be further categorized into ''authentic'', ''reproduction'', and ''stage'' performers.
*'''Academic players''', playing more sophisticated contemporary concert banduras. These performers have a [[tertiary education]] majoring in bandura performance and typically perform works by Western classical composers in addition to, or instead of, Ukrainian folk music. This category can be further divided into instrumentalists (who only perform instrumental works) and vocalists (who primarily use the bandura to accompany their voice). The most common academic bandurists play in the [[Kiev academic style]]. There are also a number of [[Kharkiv style]] academic bandurists.
* So-called "'''Fakeloric'''" '''performers''', who play stylized songs and repertoire on contemporary instruments. Othen these performers refer to themselves as contemporary kobzars. Many contemporary blind bandurists can be placed into this category.
*'''Ensemble performers''' - performers who sing in a choir and accompany their chorral performance with their own playing on the bandura.

===Ensembles===
[[Image:1902 Conference.jpeg|thumb|150px|Performance at the XIIth Archeological conference in 1902.]]
[[Image:Kyiv1925.jpeg|thumb|150px|The Kiev Bandurist Capella 1928.]]
[[Image:Kaplelia39.jpg|thumb|150px|[[The Canadian Bandurist Capella]].]]

Evidence of ensemble playing prior to the 20th century is scarce, although there do exist accounts of two or sometimes three kobzars playing together at bazaars, especially in the area around Kharkiv.

The first documented performance by a bandura ensemble however took place in Kharkiv in 1902, at the [[XIIth Archeological conference]]. The performance had a very positive effect on the popularity of the bandura and ensemble bandura playing. Attempts were made by [[Hnat Khotkevych]] to repeat the performance and take the ensemble on tour throughout [[Ukraine]], but permission was not obtained from the Russian authorities.

In 1905 there is evidence of the first performance of a bandura quartet of non-blind bandurists performing in [[Moscow]]. From 1906 small bandura ensembles began to form not just from kobzars who had participated in the [[Kharkiv]] performance of 1902 but also from non-blind bandurists and had become interested in the instrument. Groups were established by [[M. Domontovych]] in Kiev and [[V. Shevchenko]] in Moscow and the Kuban.

What is considered to be the first professional (in the sense that this was their main livelihood) bandurist ensemble was established by [[Vasyl Yemetz]] in 1918 and became known as the [[Kiev Bandurist Capella]]. Despite periods in which the ensemble did not function due to the political turmoil within the country, the ensemble re-established and re-defined itself on numerous occasions and through its concerts stimulated the establishment of many other similar bandura groups. By 1928 there were over 900 bandura ensembles in [[Ukraine]].

Active persecution of bandurists in the 1930s resulted in many players being murdered or persecuted in the 1930s. Many of those that continued playing took the opportunity of seeking freedom emigrating to the West. The [[Ukrainian Bandurist Chorus]] which was originally established in 1941 during the Nazi occupation emigrated as a group. It settled in [[Detroit]] in the USA where it continued to actively propagated the art form in the West.

The [[Kiev State Bandurist Capella]] was re-established in [[Kiev]] in 1948 under the direction of [[Oleksander Minkivsky]]. Many members after being mobilized to the front in 1941 had died. Others had emigrated. It currently has over 70 members. Numerous other bandurist Capellas exist in Ukraine throughout the country having all male membership, mixed membership, or just female membership. A capella made up of blind bandurists also exists in Lviv.

Bandurist choruses, ensembles and capellas were also established in [[Argentina]], Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Paraguay, Poland the United States and Venezuela.

'''''Cliff Hanger''''' is the name of two different 1983 [[comic strip]]s, one published in the [[United Kingdom]] and the other in the [[United States]].

==British version==

The British ''Cliff Hanger'' was written and drawn by [[Jack Edward Oliver]]. It first appeared in the 25 June 1983 issue of the British comics magazine [[Buster (comics)|Buster]]. 

Watching a television show called 'Now Get Out of This' (a [[parody]] of [[Now Get Out of That]]), Cliff remarks that he thinks he could get out of everything. This is overheard by the '''Evil Spies''', agents of M.E.S.S. (the Mysterious Evil Spies Society). They tell Cliff that he's now a [[guinea pig]] in their traps, and if he doesn't survive, they'll know the traps will be good enough to use against secret agents.

From then on, the premise of the strip every week would be that Cliff is suddenly transported into a dangerous situation by the spies, using the Atomic Matter Transmitter. Three options would be presented to the readers, who would select one by ticking one of the boxes, and turning to another page to see whether their choice was correct or not. For example, in the first strip, Cliff is stranded on a moving artificial desert island. Just as it's about to hit the shore, the [[Ocean current|current]] changes and Cliff is driven back into the [[shark]] infested sea. The choices were 'Take off his shoe and use it to paddle the island to the shore', 'Pull out the tree and use it as a raft' and 'Climb the tree'. A and B were incorrect- using the shoe as a paddle simply sent Cliff round in circles, and pulling out the tree revealed it was plugging a hole, causing the island to sink. The correct answer was C, as Cliff's weight caused the tree to bend over onto the shore, lifting Cliff to safety.

The strip featured several minor background details that would occur in every issue, including a box with a handle, a plaster, the word '[[Acme Corporation|Acme]]', an arrow with another (backwards facing) arrow inside it, a [[warthog]], the initials 'JEO', a [[worm]], and a sign saying "Abolish Tuesdays". A running gag would feature one of the Evil Spies' constant wondering why his counterpart would frequently call him "Ray" even though that wasn't his name, when in fact he was simply referring to one of the gadgets ("Fire the Transporter Ray!").
Another thing of note is that Cliff's jumper often featured the strip number on it, starting with a "1" in the first, and going on well into the hundreds at the end. Over the years, several continuous storylines emerged featuring parodies of popular film and television series of the day, including [[James Bond]], the [[Star Wars]] Trilogy, [[Back to the Future]] and [[List of Transformers TV series|Transformers]]. The strip ended in 1987, replaced by [[Vid Kid]].

However, as Buster moved into the 1990s, the amount of reprints started to dramatically increase, and several old strips began to reappear. Cliff Hanger was one of these, though as J. Edward Oliver was still working for the comic, he was able to turn the originally black and white pages into full colour. With most of the readers unaware that these were reprints, this gave the impression that they were brand new. In February 1998, when the strips started being reprinted for a third time, rather than continue to advertise them as new, the '''Cliff Hanger Classic''' strand was started. Here there would be an afterword at the bottom of the strips, written by Jack, featuring factual information like the original issue dates, background details explained, the most popular television programmes of that week, or the top 5 of that week's [[UK Singles Chart]].

By 1999, virtually the entire comic featured reprints. Because of this, J. Edward Oliver decided to draw one final strip, which appeared in issue 118/99, dated 7–21 July 1999 (the comic had become a fortnightly publication in 1995). Finding the Evil Spies in danger, all three options led to the conclusion that the Evil Spies would never trap Cliff again (if Cliff called the police, the spies would be arrested, if Cliff helped them out, they would stop trapping Cliff as a gesture of thanks, etc.). This issue also featured the final appearance of 'b-mail', the name used at the time for the Letters Page (which Jack also wrote). Cliff's final appearance was in a cameo appearance in the last page of Buster's final issue, which occurred half a year later. Explaining how all the characters ended, and once again drawn by J. Edward Oliver, Cliff was seen mourning the passing of Bernie Banks (the lead character in [[Memory Banks (comic strip)|Memory Banks]], another Buster strip) who had apparently forgotten how to breathe. Symbolising that this was indeed the final issue, his jumper carried the word 'END'.

==American version==
The American ''Cliff Hanger'' was written by [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]] with artwork by [[Al Williamson]].  The title character was a swashbuckling adventurer who crashlands in an unnamed jungle region in the late 1930s and finds himself in a mysterious plot involving a secret research facility.  

The strip originally appeared as a back-up feature in the four issue run of [[Somerset Holmes]], a 1983 thriller [[comic book]] also by Jones and Williamson.  It has been reprinted in collections of Williamson's artwork.

A '''conservation scientist''' is a museum professional who works in the field of [[Conservation science (cultural heritage)|conservation science]] and whose focus is on the research of [[cultural heritage]] (e.g. art, artifacts, buildings, and monuments) through scientific inquiry. Conservation scientists conduct applied scientific research and techniques to determine the material, chemical, and technical aspects of cultural heritage. The technical information conservation scientists gather is then used by [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] and [[curators]] to decide the most suitable [[conservation-restoration|conservation]] treatments for the examined object and/or adds to our knowledge about the object by providing answers about the material composition, fabrication, authenticity, and previous restoration treatments.

==Responsibilities and duties==
The main responsibility of a conservation scientist is to provide analytical and technical support for the preservation and restoration of cultural objects using scientific analysis and techniques.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Whitmore, P. (Eds.). (2005). [http://mac.mellon.org/NSF-MellonWorkshop/Whitmore%20White%20paper.pdf Conservation Science Research: Activities, Needs, and Funding Opportunities]. (A Report to the National Science Foundation). Retrieved April 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  These tasks are accomplished primarily in four ways: 1.) the identification of materials and fabrication of an object, 2.) studying the degradation mechanisms of the objects, 3.) developing and testing conservation-restoration treatments, and 4.) developing and testing new analytical techniques and equipment. Each task is properly documented by conservation scientists with such information as composition, condition, history, and suggested treatments.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  Additionally, many of these tasks require conservation scientists to collaborate with other museum professionals and industrial/mainstream scientists in order to properly accomplish them, in particular with conservators and curators (see Related positions).

===Identification===
[[File:IMA Conservation Scientist using Raman spectroscopy 1.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Conservation scientist using [[Raman spectroscopy]] at the Indianapolis Museum of Art.]]
The identification of an object’s component materials is the most basic of conservation science tasks.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  This is typically accomplished using non-destructive examination techniques or, if necessary, destructive analytical techniques designed for small samples (see Instruments and uses). The information yielded about the object’s material composition aids in the development of preventive conservation measures- such as lighting and humidity controls-and the selection of appropriate restoration treatments. The analysis of materials can also lead to discoveries about the object’s origin and fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. (2013). [http://www.mfah.org/research/conservation/conservation-science/ Conservation Science]. Retrieved April 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such studies, called technical art history, can provide insight into the time period of an object, its authenticity, the artist, and previous restoration treatments. In addition to leading to new interpretations, this information impacts the selection of treatments by conservators and conservation scientists.

===Degradation===
Another key focus of conservation science is studying the degradation or deterioration mechanism of objects. Using chemical analysis, conservation scientists can determine the underlying material processes (i.e. aging and chemical reactions), risk factors, and environmental conditions causing the objects to degrade.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;The Getty Conservation Institute. (2013) [http://www.getty.edu/conservation/about/science/ Science Department]. Retrieved April 13, 2104.&lt;/ref&gt;  This information can then be used by conservation scientists, in collaboration with conservators, to develop appropriate treatments for objects, in particular treatments that can provide long-term stability and preservation for the examined object.

===Development of conservation-restoration treatments===
The continuing development of new conservation materials (e.g. cleaning solvents) and techniques is an essential aspect of the conservation of cultural heritage. This research ensures the continued existence of cultural heritage in the best condition possible considering their age and degradation. Conservators often rely on conservation scientists for their scientific knowledge and skills in the development of these materials and treatments. Conservation scientists are asked to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of current materials and treatments, to improve those material/techniques, and to devise new materials and techniques.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  The goal is to develop conservation treatments and materials that can slow the degradation of materials and further damage effectively and without harming the object.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Development of new analytical techniques and equipment===
In addition to developing conservation treatments and materials, conservation scientists collaborate with industrial scientists and instrument manufactures in the development of new analytical techniques and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Indianapolis Museum of Art. (n.d.). [http://www.imamuseum.org/research/conservation-science Conservation Science]. Retrieved April 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservation scientists are constantly looking for and developing new techniques and instruments that improve the condition and treatment of objects. To this end, scientists are developing new techniques and instruments to: decrease and eliminate the need for sampling objects to minimize collateral damage, better analyze materials, document results, improve ease (e.g. portability), improve environmental monitoring.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===Education===
In addition to their scientific responsibilities, conservation scientists have a duty to help educate new conservations scientists, the conservation field, and the public as part of their ethical code.&lt;ref&gt;(AIC. (1994). [http://www.conservation-us.org/about-us/core-documents/code-of-ethics#.U1WY6I1OUeE Core Documents: Code of Ethics]. Retrieved April 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  To ensure the continuation and quality of their profession, conservation scientists are involved in the training of new conservation scientists as members in academic conservation departments, adjunct faculty, and as mentors to those in fellowships, internships, and entry-level jobs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  Conservation scientists also help educate the conservation community at large by disseminating their research to promote the growth and use of the best conservation practices and materials. Lastly, conservation scientists educate the public about conservation science to promote awareness of about the field and its importance to the preservation of our cultural heritage.

==Knowledge, abilities, and skills==
The basic knowledge, skills, and abilities needed by conservation scientists are:
*advance knowledge in a physical or applied science discipline (e.g. physics, chemistry, material science, biology, engineering, and geology)
*basic knowledge of conservation and relevant humanities disciplines (e.g. art history, archaeology, anthropology, history, fine arts, etc.)
*critical thinking and creative problem solving
*the ability to formulate and carry out research&lt;ref&gt;EPISCON. (1999). [http://www.episcon.scienze.unibo.it/episcon/ Bologna document] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140421220515/http://www.episcon.scienze.unibo.it/episcon/ |date=2014-04-21 }}. Retrieved April 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
*experience using a broad range of analytical techniques and equipment (see Instrumentation and uses)
*the ability to collaborate and work in a team
*the ability to communicate effectively

==Instrumentation and uses==
[[File:IMA Conservation Science Lab.JPG|thumb|right|500px|Indianapolis Museum of Art Conservation Science Laboratory.]]
Conservation scientists use a variety of microscopic, spectroscopic, chromatographic, and other scientific techniques and instruments to physically and chemically examine objects.&lt;ref&gt;Indianapolis Museum of Art. (n.d.). [http://www.imamuseum.org/research/conservation-science/instrumentation Instrumentation]. Retrieved April 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-destructive techniques are favored by conservation scientists so to preserve the originality, integrity, and current state of the object as much as possible. Such non-destructive methods include visual examination, advanced imaging techniques, and X-rays.&lt;ref&gt;Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. (n.d.). [http://www.mfah.org/research/conservation/conservation-science/ Conservation Science]. Retrieved April 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes, sampling an object is unavoidable. In these cases, microscopic fragments are removed from the object- rarely visible to the naked eye- and their original location is documented. The scientific and ethical demands of a conservation scientist require a variety of instruments- taken from mainstream science and slightly modified- in order to conduct their research properly. Listed below are some of the most commonly used instruments in museum laboratories today and how they are used by conservation scientists.

'''Microscopic:'''

==Education and training==
There is much discussion and debate in the field of conservation science about the amount and type of education and training that should be required for people entering the field. Currently, there is no one set path to becoming a conservation scientist. A 2013 survey conducted by the International Center for the Study of Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property ([[ICCROM]]) on the education and training paths for conservation scientists worldwide concluded that:

{{quotation | the largest categories of recommend qualifications are the combinations BA+MA (24%) in conservation and BSc+MA in Conservation (23%). The majority, 87%, thinks you need both science and conservation qualifications. 44% of the respondents thing you should have 0-2 years of working experience, and 41% think you need 3 years or more.&lt;ref&gt;ICCROM. (2013). [http://forum2013.iccrom.org/background-research/ Survey of Conservation Education Programes] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140413211840/http://forum2013.iccrom.org/background-research/ |date=2014-04-13 }}. Retrieved April 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This survey demonstrates that there is no worldwide consensus on the type and amount of education and training needed to become a conservation scientist, resulting in regional and institutional variations.

In the United States, the most common route taken is an advanced degree in a physical, natural, or applied science discipline such as physics, chemistry, material science, biology, engineering, and geology.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Trentelman, K. (Summer 2005). [http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/20_2/news_in_cons1.html Training and Education in Conservation Science]. GCI Newsletter, 20.2. Retrieved April 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Master’s degrees are acceptable, but most conservation scientists have their PhD. In fact, a doctoral degree is becoming an increasingly common requirement for even entry-level conservation science positions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;  A basic knowledge of conservation theory and practice, art history, and/or other relevant humanities disciplines (e.g. archaeology, anthropology, fine arts, history, etc.) is also essential. Scientists seeking to enter the field typically gain this experience and knowledge through postdoctoral fellowships. There are several postdoctoral programs in particular for scientists to receive specialized training in conservation science, including those at the [[National Gallery of Art]] (the Charles Culpepper Fellowships), Harvard University Art Museum, and the [[Getty Conservation Institute]]. Numerous museums and cultural institutions also have individual advanced training fellowships in conservation science through such organizations as the Kress Foundation and the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;  The Northwestern University-Art Institute of Chicago Center for Scientific Studies (NU-ACCESS) is one example of an Andrew W. Mellon funded fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;Northwestern University. (2013).

In Europe, there are two common routes taken to become a conservation scientist.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;EPISCON. (1999). [http://www.episcon.scienze.unibo.it/episcon/bologna-document Bologna document] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140420015519/http://www.episcon.scienze.unibo.it/episcon/bologna-document |date=2014-04-20 }}. Retrieved April 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first path is a postgraduate course in conservation science that includes training, research, and practice/experience with practicing conservators-restorers. The European PhD in Science for Conservation (EPISCON), which is a three-year fellowship program at ten participating institutions, is an example of such a program.
&lt;ref&gt;EPISCON. (n.d.).

Retrieved April 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The second pathway is on the job training on a conservation science team combined with continuous professional development.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

==Professional organizations==
As a unique mixture of academic disciplines, conservation scientists may join an assortment of professional organizations to suit their varied needs and specializations. These organizations may include those dedicated solely to conservation science, conservation, or a related science field. Many of the general conservation and related science organizations, in fact, have specialized groups for conservation science. The [[American Ceramic Society]], for example, has an Art, Archaeology, and Conservation Science division devoted to advancing the scientific study of ceramics and their preservation.&lt;ref&gt;The American Ceramic Society. (2013). [http://ceramics.org/divisions/art-division Art, Archaeology and Conservation Science Division.] Retrieved April 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

(n.d.). [http://www.mfah.org/research/conservation/conservation-science/ Conservation Science]. Retrieved April 19, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the similar nature of their duties, they most frequently work with conservators (i.e. [[conservator-restorer]] and [[object conservator]]) and [[curators]] to complete technical studies on the objects in their museum’s collection to determine the materials used, the artist’s techniques, the authenticity of the work, and previous conservation treatments. These three professions also collaborate to determine conservation treatment goals and the ideal environmental conditions ([[preventive conservation]]) for the objects. [[Exhibition designers]], [[architects]], and [[collection managers]] also consult with conservation scientists to ensure that environmental conditions are suitable for the objects while either in storage or on display.

Industrial scientists are also consulted by conservation scientists about object materials and chemical studies. The two groups of scientists, along with instrument manufactures, also collaborate “to develop and adapt new non-invasive analytical techniques.”&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;

'''Cyriac K. Pullapilly''' is a [[Royal Society of Arts|Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts]], a former priest of the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]] and an emeritus professor of history at [[Saint Mary's College (Indiana)|Saint Mary's College, Indiana]].

==Biography==
Cyriac Pullapilly was born in [[South India]]. He was ordained in 1948, and completed his undergraduate studies at the St. Joseph Apostolic seminary, which at its time, was the second-largest seminary in the world. While attending the seminary, he wrote for a missionary publication called ''Home Field''. He also was part of the anti-communist movement in his college and wrote various publications critical of the communist government which controlled the legislature in his state.&lt;ref name="suburbanite"&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Priest from India views East, West|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/54969033/|accessdate=2016-10-05|agency=Suburbanite Economist|date=August 3, 1960|page=15 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, he founded the Semester Around the World Program, where [[University of Notre Dame]] and Saint Mary's College, Indiana, students travelled the world and studied in India.

He has a multi-disciplinary approach to his studies and has published works on a broad range of subjects. His research has been supported by the [[Fulbright Foundation]] and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], and in 2006 – the year in which he was admitted to the Royal Society of Arts – he held a visiting academic post at the [[University of Cambridge]]. He has also established his own publishing company and produced an "inclusive-language" edition of the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Queen to honor educator: Royal Society of Arts to induct SMC prof |first=Kim |last=Abeel |date=October 9, 2006 |publisher=The Observer |location=Notre Dame, IN |url=http://www.ndsmcobserver.com/2.2754/queen-to-honor-educator-1.264092#.UT5LZvnbBBl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |page=xxxv |title=Asia in the Making of Europe: East Asia |first1=Donald Frederick |last1=Lach |first2=Edwin J. |last2=Van Kley |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-22646-765-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based upon his founding of the Semester Around the World program, Pullapilly received the Spes Unica Award from Saint Mary's College for his outstanding service to the College in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.saintmarys.edu/files/courier/issues/courier-07summer.pdf | title=Awards |  journal=Courier | publisher=St. Mary's College | volume=82 | number=2 | date=Summer 2007 | page=40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Pullapilly studied at St Thomas College in India and then at the [[University of Chicago]], where he earned his PhD. He and his wife are both Indian immigrants to the United States, raising their children in [[South Bend, Indiana]]. Pullapilly is the father of filmmaker [[Gita Pullapilly]].&lt;ref name="NYT2009"/&gt;

An only child, Pullapilly's parents were initially reluctant to let him become a priest. Around 1960, he expressed interest in missionary work but said that he did not have the time.&lt;ref name="suburbanite"/&gt;

The '''dimples of Venus''' (also known as '''back dimples''', '''butt dimples''' or '''Venusian dimples''') are [[sagittal]]ly [[symmetrical]] indentations sometimes visible on the human lower [[Human back|back]], just [[Anatomical terms of location#Usage in human anatomy|superior]] to the [[gluteal cleft]]. They are directly [[Anatomical terms of location#Other directional terms|superficial]] to the two [[sacroiliac joint]]s, the sites where the [[sacrum]] attaches to the [[ilium (bone)|ilium]] of the [[pelvis]].

==Overview==
The term "dimples of Venus", while informal, is a historically accepted name within the medical profession for the superficial topography of the sacroiliac joints. The Latin name is ''fossae lumbales laterales'' ("lateral lumbar indentations"). These indentations are created by a short [[ligament]] stretching between the [[posterior superior iliac spine]] and the skin.

Named after [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the Roman goddess of [[beauty]], they are sometimes believed to be a mark of beauty. The features may be seen on both female and male backs, but seem to be more common and more prominent in women.

There are other deep-to-superficial skin ligaments, such as "[[Cooper's ligaments]]", which are present in the breast and are found between the pectoralis major fascia and the skin.

Another use of the term "dimples of Venus" in surgical anatomy refers to two symmetrical indentations on the posterior aspect of the [[sacrum]], which also contain a venous channel. They are used as a landmark for finding the superior articular facets of the sacrum as a guide to place sacral pedicle screws in spine surgery.&lt;ref&gt;''Youmans Neurological Surgery''; 5th ed., 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[sarcophagus]] of '''Eshmunazar II''' ([[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]: ''{{transl|sem|ʾšmnʿzr}}''), a [[Phoenicia]]n king of [[Sidon]] and the son of King [[Tabnit]] (possibly the Greek [[Tenes]]), was created in the early 5th century BCE.  It was unearthed in 1855 at a site near [[Sidon]] and is now in the [[Louvre]]. The sarcophagus was likely created in Egypt, being carved from [[amphibolite]] from [[Wadi Hammamat]].

The inscription states that the "Lord of Kings" granted the Sidonian kings territory in Palestine: [[Tel Dor|Dor]], [[Jaffa]], the [[Plain of Sharon]].&lt;ref&gt;Louvre website: "The favor of the Persian king had increased the territory of Sidon by granting it part of Palestine: "The Lord of Kings gave us Dor and Yapho, the rich wheat-lands that are in the Plain of Sharon, in recognition of the great deeds that I accomplished and we have added to the lands that are forever those of the Sidonians.""&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription is the first discovered in the [[Phoenician language]] from the area known as [[Phoenicia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=:de:Reinhard G. Lehmann|first=Reinhard G.|last=Lehmann|title=Wilhelm Gesenius and the Rise of Phoenician Philology|journal=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift für die alttestamentliche Wissenschaft|volume=427|location=Berlin / Boston|publisher=De Gruyter|date=2013|pages=209–266|url=http://www.hebraistik.uni-mainz.de/Dateien/Lehmann_Gesenius-Phoenix_2013.pdf}} Quote: "Alas, all these were either late or Punic, and came from Cyprus, from the ruins of Kition, from Malta, Sardinia, Athens, and Carthage, but not yet from the Phoenician homeland. The first Phoenician text as such was found as late as 1855, the Eshmunazor sarcophagus inscription from Sidon."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The sarcophagus was discovered in the Necropolis of Magharat Abloun ("Cavern of Apollo") on 20 February 1855 by Aimé Péretié, chancellor of the French consulate of Beirut. It was purchased in the same year by [[Honoré Théodoric d'Albert de Luynes]], who donated it to the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref name=Birch/&gt;

==Inscription==
[[File:Yafo-museum-4090.jpg|thumb|left|Copy of the inscription at the Jaffa museum]]
The sarcophagus bears a 22 line inscription, known as '''KAI-14''',&lt;ref name="KAI"&gt;"[[Kanaanäische und Aramäische Inschriften]]", Herbert Donner, Wolfgang Röllig , {{ISBN|3-447-04587-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; written in the [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician]] [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite language]], in the [[Phoenician alphabet]].  The inscription identifies the king inside and warns people not to disturb his repose.&lt;ref name="abt"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Cline | first = Austin | title = Sidon Sarcophagus: Illustration of the Sarcophagus of Eshmunazar II Found Near Sidon, Lebanon | work = About.com | accessdate = 2009-03-27 | url = http://atheism.about.com/od/bibleplacescities/ig/Sidon-Lebanon-Phoenician-Photo/Sidon-Sarcophagus.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language used in the inscription is a [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite dialect]] mutually intelligible with [[Biblical Hebrew]].

As in other Phoenician inscriptions, the text seems to use no, or hardly any, ''[[matres lectionis]]''. As in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], the [[preposition]] אית ('''ʾyt''') is used as an [[accusative case|accusative]] marker, while את ('''ʾt''') is used for "with".&lt;ref name="KAI" /&gt;

== Translation ==
The translation below is based on that by [[Julius Oppert]],&lt;ref name=Birch&gt;''[[Samuel Birch]], [https://archive.org/stream/recordsofpastbei09sociiala#page/109/mode/1up Records of the past: Being English Translations of the Ancient Monuments of Egypt and Western Asia]'', vol. 9, 1877, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; amended with the help of a more recent translation in Prichard &amp; Fleming.&lt;ref&gt;James B. Prichard and Daniel E. Fleming, ''The Ancient Near East:  An Anthology of Texts and Pictures'', 2011, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

# In the month of [[Marcheshvan|Bul]],&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The eighth month of the Phoenician year which was identical with the Judaic.&lt;/ref&gt; in the fourteenth year of the royalty of King Eshmunazar,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;King Eshmunazar lived in the fourth century B.C., this is generally admitted on account of the form of the sarcophagus, which was certainly Egyptian; there are even in the middle of it traces of hieroglyphs which have been erased. The King Tabnit may be the Tennes of Greek authors.&lt;/ref&gt; King of the two Sidons,
# son of King [[Tabnit]], King of the two Sidons, King Eshmunazar, King of the two Sidons, said as follows: I am carried away,
# before my time, the son of (few) days, an orphan, the son of a widow. And I am lying in this coffin, and in this tomb,
# in the place which I have built. Whoever you are, of royal race or an ordinary man, may he not open this resting-place, and
# may he not search after anything, for nothing whatsoever has been placed into it. May he not move the coffin in which I am resting, nor carry
# me away from this resting-place to another resting-place. Whatever a man may tell thee, do not listen to him: For every royal race and
# every ordinary man, who will open this resting-place or who will carry away the coffin where I repose, or who will carry me
# away from this resting-place: may they not have any funeral couch with the embalmers (the Ropheïm), may they not be buried in a grave, and may there not be a son or offspring
# to succeed to them, and may the sacred gods abandon them to a mighty ruler who (might) rule them, in order
# to exterminate that royal race or man who will open this resting-place or who will take away
# this coffin, and also the offspring of this royal race, or of that ordinary man. There shall be to them no root below, nor
# fruit above, nor living form under the sun. For I am carried away, before my time, the son of
# (few) days, an orphan, the son of a widow. For I, Eshmunazar, King of the two Sidons, son of
# King Tabnit, King of the two Sidons, the grandson of King Eshmunazar, King of the two Sidons, And my mother Amoashtart,
# the Priestess of Astarte, our mistress, the Queen, the daughter of King Eshmunazar, King of the two Sidons: It is we who have built the temple of
# the gods, and the temple of Astaroth, on the seaside Sidon,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The seaside Sidon' Sidon eres yam, seems to be one of the two Sidons, the other may have been the Sidon of the mountain. Sennacherib speaks also of the two Sidons, the great and the little one&lt;/ref&gt; and have placed there (the image of) Astaroth in Shamem-Addirim. And it is we
# who have built a [[Temple of Eshmun|temple for Eshmun]], the holy prince, at the purpleshells River on the mountain, and have established him in Shamem-Addirim. And it is we who have built the temples
# for the gods of the two Sidons, in the seaside Sidon, tile temple of Baal-Sidon and the temple of Ashtart-Shem-Baal. Moreover, the Lord of Kings&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The "Lords of the Kings" seem not to be the Kings of Persia, but an epithet applicable to a divine king.&lt;/ref&gt; gave us
# [[Tel Dor|Dor]] and [[Jaffa|Joppa]], the mighty lands of [[Dagon]], which are in tile plain of [[Sharon|Saron]], in accordance with the important deeds which I did. And we annexed them
# to the boundary of the land, that they would belong to the two Sidons for ever. Whoever you are, of royal race or ordinary man, may he not open it
# and may he not uncover me and may he not carry me away from this resting-place. Otherwise,
# the sacred gods shall abandon them and exterminate this royal race and this ordinary man and their offspring for ever.

The text of the 22 line inscription, on the front side of the sarcophagus, follows, with one-to one transliteration into the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. The original text contains no word breaks; these are merely suggested; numbers appear in the original inscription in an Egyptian standard.

[[File:Blue eyes.JPG|thumb|[[Nazar (amulet)|Nazars]], [[amulet|charms]] used to ward off the evil eye.]]
The '''evil eye''' is a curse or legend  believed to be cast by a malevolent glare, usually given to a person when they are unaware. Many cultures believe that receiving the evil eye will cause misfortune or injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=C|title=Hypothesis:The Electrophysicological Basis of the Evil Eye Belief|journal=Anthropology of Consciousness|year=2010|doi=10.1111/j.1556-3537.2010.01020.x|volume=21|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Talisman]]s created to protect against the evil eye are also frequently called "evil eyes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/evil%20eye |title=Definition for "evil eye" from Merriam Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/197336/evil-eye |title=evil eye (occult) |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea expressed by the term causes many different cultures to pursue protective measures against it. The concept and its significance vary widely among different [[cultural diversity|cultures]], primarily in [[West Asia]]. The idea appears multiple times in [[rabbinic literature|Jewish rabbinic literature]].&lt;ref name=ulmer&gt;{{cite book |title=The evil eye in the Bible and in rabbinic literature |author=Ulmer, Rivka |editor=KTAV Publishing House, Inc. |year=1994 |isbn=0-88125-463-0|page=176 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cwB8Hfkjpx0C&amp;pg=PA176}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a widely extended belief among many Mediterranean and Asian tribes and cultures. [[Amulet|Charms]] and decorations with eye-like symbols known as [[Nazar (amulet)|nazars]], which are used to repel the evil eye, are a common sight across [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Albania]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Lebanon]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], [[Israel]], [[Egypt]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Jordan]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Pakistan]], parts of [[North India]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Morocco]], southern [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Malta]], [[Romania]], the [[Balkans]], the [[Levant]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Syria]], and [[Mexico]], and have become a popular choice of souvenir with tourists.

==History==
Belief in the evil eye dates back to [[Classical antiquity]]. It is referenced by [[Hesiod]], [[Callimachus]], [[Plato]], [[Diodorus Siculus]], [[Theocritus]], [[Plutarch]], [[Heliodorus of Emesa|Heliodorus]], [[Pliny the Elder]], and [[Aulus Gellius]]. Peter Walcot's ''Envy and the Greeks'' (1978) listed more than one hundred works by these and other authors mentioning the evil eye.

===Classical antiquity===
[[File:Antiochia - House of the Evil Eye.jpg|thumb|Roman-era mosaic from Antioch depicting a plethora of devices against the evil eye]]
Classical authors attempted both to describe and to explain the function of the evil eye. Plutarch's scientific explanation stated that the eyes were the chief, if not sole, source of the deadly rays that were supposed to spring up like poisoned darts from the inner recesses of a person possessing the evil eye. Plutarch treated the phenomenon of the evil eye as something seemingly inexplicable that is a source of wonder and cause of incredulity.{{efn|Plutarch, ''[[Moralia]]'', Book VII}} Pliny the Elder described the ability of certain African enchanters to have the "power of fascination with the eyes and can even kill those on whom they fix their gaze".{{efn|Pliny the Elderh, ''[[Natural History|Natural History (Pliny)]]'', VII.2}}

The idea of the evil eye appears in the poetry of [[Virgil]] in a conversation between the shepherds Menalcas and Damoetas.{{efn|Virgil, ''[[Eclogues]]'', III.1.103}} In the passage, Menalcas is lamenting the poor health of his stock: "What eye is it that has fascinated my tender lambs?".

====Protection from the eye====
The belief in the evil eye during antiquity varied across different regions and periods. The evil eye was not feared with equal intensity in every corner of the Roman Empire. There were places in which people felt more conscious of the danger of the evil eye. In Roman times, not only were individuals considered to possess the power of the evil eye but whole tribes, especially those of Pontus and Scythia, were believed to be transmitters of the evil eye.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The [[fascinum|phallic charm]] called ''[[wikt:fascinum#Latin|fascinum]]'' in Latin, from the verb ''fascinare'', "to cast a spell" (the origin of the English word "[[wikt:fascinate|fascinate]]") is one example of an apotropaic object used against the evil eye. They have been found throughout Europe and into the Middle East from contexts dating from the first century BC to the fourth century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Whitmore, A. |date=2017 |chapter=Fascinating ''fascina'': apotropaic magic and how to wear a penis |editor1=Cifarelli, M. |editor2=Gawlinkski, L. |title=What shall I say of clothes? Theoretical and Methodological Approaches to the Study of Dress in Antiquity |place=Boston, MA |publisher=[[American Institute of Archaeology]] |pages=47-65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phallic charms were often objects of personal adornment (such as pendants and finger rings), but also appeared as stone carvings on buildings,&lt;ref name='BAR'&gt;{{cite book |author1=Parker, A. |date=2017 |chapter=Protecting the Troops? Phallic Carvings in the North of Roman Britain |editor1=Parker, A |title=''Ad Vallum'': Papers on the Roman Army and Frontiers in celebration of Dr [[Brian Dobson (archaeologist)|Brian Dobson]] |series=BAR British Series 631 |place=Oxford |publisher=British Archaeological Report |pages=117-130}}&lt;/ref&gt; mosaics, and wind-chimes (''[[Tintinnabulum (Ancient Rome)|tintinnabula]]'').&lt;ref name='TRAC'&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Parker, A. |date=2018 |chapter=The Bells!

In describing their ability to deflect the Evil Eye, [[Ralph Merrifield]] described the Roman phallic charm as a "kind of lightning conductor for bad luck".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Merrifield, R. |date=1969 |title=Roman London |place=London |publisher=Cassell |page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Around the world==
[[File:Votive tree cappadocia.jpg|thumb|right|Tree with nazars in [[Cappadocia]], [[Turkey]].]]
Belief in the evil eye is strongest in [[West Asia]], [[Latin America]], [[East Africa|East]] and [[West Africa]], [[Central America]], [[Central Asia]], and [[Europe]], especially the [[Mediterranean region]]; it has also spread to areas, including northern Europe, particularly in the [[Celts|Celtic]] regions, and the [[Americas]], where it was brought by European colonists and West Asian immigrants.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Belief in the evil eye is found in the [[Islam]]ic doctrine, based upon the statement of Prophet [[Muhammad]], "The influence of an evil eye is a fact..." [Sahih Muslim, Book 26, Number 5427].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/026.smt.html#026.5427 |title=USC-MSA Compendium of Muslim Texts |publisher=Usc.edu |access-date=2007-09-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903081746/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/026.smt.html#026.5427#026.5427 |archive-date=2007-09-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Authentic practices of warding off the evil eye are also commonly practiced by Muslims: rather than directly expressing appreciation of, for example, a child's beauty, it is customary to say ''[[Masha'Allah]]'', that is, "God has willed it", or invoking God's blessings upon the object or person that is being admired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://makedua.com/display_dua.php?sectionid=118 |title=Du'a – What to say when in fear of afflicting something or someone with one?s eye |publisher=Makedua.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of beliefs about the evil eye are also found in [[folk religion]], typically revolving around the use of [[amulet]]s or [[talisman]]s as a means of protection.

In the [[Aegean Region]] and other areas where light-colored eyes are relatively rare, people with [[eye color|green eyes]], and especially blue eyes, are thought to bestow the curse, intentionally or unintentionally.&lt;ref&gt;Cora Lynn Daniels, et al., eds, ''Encyclopædia of Superstitions, Folklore, and the Occult Sciences of the World'' (Volume III), p. 1273, Univ.

Among those who do not take the evil eye literally, either by reason of the culture in which they were raised or because they simply do not believe it, the phrase, "to give someone the evil eye" usually means simply to glare at the person in anger or disgust. The term has entered into common usage within the [[English language]]. Within the broadcasting industry it refers to when a presenter signals to the interviewee or co-presenter to stop talking due to a shortage of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=He may sound like a Dalek doing a bad impression of Kenneth Williams, but why DO so many BBC stars want to exterminate Pesto?|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2063409/He-sound-like-Dalek-doing-bad-impression-Kenneth-Williams-DO-BBC-stars-want-exterminate-Pesto.html|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|date=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protective talismans and cures==
[[File:WPVA-khamsa.svg|upright|thumb|left|The [[Hamsa]], a charm made to ward off the evil eye.]]
Attempts to ward off the curse of the evil eye have resulted in a number of [[amulet|talismans]] in many cultures. As a class, they are called "''apotropaic''" (Greek for "prophylactic" / προφυλακτικός or "protective", literally: "turns away") talismans, meaning that they turn away or turn back harm.

Disks or balls, consisting of concentric blue and white circles (usually, from inside to outside, dark blue, light blue, white, and dark blue) representing an evil eye are common apotropaic talismans in West Asia, found on the [[prow]]s of Mediterranean [[boat]]s and elsewhere; in some forms of the folklore, the staring eyes are supposed to bend the malicious gaze back to the [[magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]].

Known as ''[[Evil eye in Turkish Culture|nazar]]'' ({{lang-tr|nazar boncuğu}} or {{lang|tr|nazarlık}}), this talisman is most frequently seen in [[Turkey]], found in or on houses and vehicles or worn as beads.
[[File:Hotamis Kilim .jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of a 19th-century Anatolian [[kilim]], with rows of crosses (Turkish: Haç) and scattered S-shaped hooks (Turkish: Çengel), both to ward off the evil eye&lt;ref name=Erbek/&gt;]]

A blue or green eye can also be found on some forms of the [[hamsa|hamsa hand]], an [[apotropaic]] hand-shaped talisman against the evil eye found in West Asia. The word hamsa, also spelled khamsa and hamesh, means "five" referring to the fingers of the hand. In [[Secular Jewish culture|Jewish culture]], the hamsa is called the [[hamsa|Hand of Miriam]]; in some Muslim cultures, the [[hamsa|Hand of Fatima]]. Though condemned as superstition by doctrinaire Muslims, it is almost exclusively among Muslims in the Near East and Mediterranean that the belief in envious looks containing destructive power or the talismanic power of a nazar to defend against them. To adherents of other faiths in the region, the nazar is an attractive decoration.

A [[Kilim motifs|variety of motifs]] to ward off the evil eye are commonly woven into tribal [[kilim]] rugs. Such motifs include a cross (Turkish: Haç) to divide the evil eye into four, a hook (Turkish: Çengel) to destroy the evil eye, or a human eye (Turkish: Göz) to avert the evil gaze. The shape of a lucky [[amulet]] (Turkish: Muska; often, a triangular package containing a sacred verse) is often woven into kilims for the same reason.&lt;ref name=Erbek&gt;{{cite book |author=Erbek, Güran |title=Kilim Catalogue No. 1 |publisher =May Selçuk A.

[[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] are also strong believers in the evil eye. They will usually wear a blue/turquoise bead around a necklace to be protected from the evil eye. Also, they might pinch the [[buttocks]], comparable to Armenians. It is said that people with green or blue eyes are more prone to the evil eye effect. {{Citation needed|reason=What is the source for this statement? Was it racially motivated in any way?

===In Judaism===
[[File:HamsaS.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Clay hamsa with an inscription in Hebrew (translates to "good luck")]]
The evil eye is mentioned several times in the classic ''[[Pirkei Avot]] (Ethics of Our Fathers)''. In Chapter II, five disciples of Rabbi [[Yochanan ben Zakai]] give advice on how to follow the good path in life and avoid the bad. [[Rabbi Eliezer]] says an evil eye is worse than a bad friend, a bad neighbor, or an evil heart.

Judaism believes that a "good eye" designates an attitude of good will and kindness towards others. Someone who has this attitude in life will rejoice when his fellow man prospers; he will wish everyone well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Issues/Magic_and_the_Supernatural/Practices_and_Beliefs/Amulets/Evil_Eye.shtml |title=Evil Eye in Judaism |publisher=My Jewish Learning }}&lt;/ref&gt; An "evil eye" denotes the opposite attitude. A man with "an evil eye" will not only feel no joy but experience actual distress when others prosper, and will rejoice when others suffer. A person of this character represents a great danger to our moral purity.&lt;ref&gt;Chapters of the Fathers, Translation &amp; Commentary by Samson Raphael Hirsch, Feldheim Publishers, {{ISBN|0-87306-182-9}} pg. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] explained that the evil eye is "an example of how one soul may affect another through unseen connections between them. We are all influenced by our environment.... The evil eye is the venomous impact from malignant feelings of jealousy and envy of those around us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morrison |first1=Chanan |last2=Kook |first2=Abraham Isaac Kook|title=Gold from the Land of Israel: A New Light on the Weekly Torah Portion - From the Writings of Rabbi Abraham Isaac HaKohen Kook' |date=2006 |publisher=Urim Publications |isbn=965-7108-92-6 |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Observant Jews avoid talking about valuable items they own, good luck that has come to them and, in particular, their children. If any of these are mentioned, the speaker and/or listener will say ''b'li ayin hara'' (Hebrew), meaning "without an evil eye", or ''kein eina hara'' (Yiddish; often shortened to ''kennahara''), "no evil eye". Another way to ward off the evil eye is to spit three times (or pretend to). Romans call this custom "despuere malum," to spit at evil. &lt;ref&gt;Joyce Eisenberg and Ellen Scolnic. "The Whole Spiel: Funny essays about digital nudniks, seder selfies and chicken soup memories," Incompra Press, {{ISBN|978-0-692-72625-9}} pg. 153 &lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested {{by whom|date=June 2016}} the 10th commandment: "do not covet anything that belongs to your neighbor" is a law against bestowing the evil eye on another person.

===Pakistan===
In [[Pakistan]], the evil eye is called ''Nazar'' (نظر). People usually may resort to reading the last three chapters of the Quran, namely [[Al-Ikhlas|Sura Ikhlas]], [[Al-Falaq|Sura Al-Falaq]] and [[Al-Nas|Sura Al-Nas]]. "[[Masha'Allah]]" ({{rtl-lang|ar|ما شاء الله}}) ("God has willed it") is commonly said to ward off the evil eye. Understanding of the evil eye varies by the level of education. Some perceive the use of black color to be useful in protecting from the evil eye. Others use "[[taawiz]]" to ward off the evil eye. Truck owners and other public transport vehicles may commonly be seen using a small black cloth on the bumpers to prevent the evil eye.&lt;ref&gt;Ghilzai, S.A., and Kanwal, A. (2016) Semiotic Analysis of Evil Eye Beliefs among Pakistani Cultures and their Predetermined Behaviour. Research Issues in social sciences, 47-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
The evil eye, known as {{lang|el|μάτι}} (''mati''), "eye", as an [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] visual device, is known to have been a fixture in Greece dating back to at least the 6th century BC, when it commonly appeared on drinking vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster. ''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions''. 2000, p. 69. {{ISBN|0877790442}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greece]], the evil eye is cast away through the process of ''xematiasma'' ({{lang|el|ξεμάτιασμα}}), whereby the "healer" silently recites a secret prayer passed over from an older relative of the opposite sex, usually a [[grandparent]]. Such prayers are revealed only under specific circumstances, as according to their customs those who reveal them indiscriminately lose their ability to cast off the evil eye. There are several regional versions of the prayer in question, a common one being: "[[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Holy Virgin]], Our Lady, if [insert name of the victim] is suffering of the evil eye, release him/her of it." [[Evil]] repeated three times. According to [[tradition|custom]], if one is indeed afflicted with the evil eye, both victim and "healer" then start yawning profusely. The "healer" then performs the sign of the cross three times, and emits spitting-like sounds in the air three times. A very similar ritual can be found in neighboring [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Bulgaria]], as well as in [[Corsica]].

Another "test" used to check if the evil eye was cast is that of the [[oil]]: under normal conditions, [[olive oil]] floats in water, as it is less dense than water. The test of the oil is performed by placing one drop of olive oil in a glass of water, typically holy water.{{Citation needed|reason=this paragraph and the next two paragraphs appear to be original research|date=July 2017}} If the drop floats, the test concludes there is no evil eye involved. If the drop sinks, then it is asserted that the evil eye is cast indeed. Another form of the [[experiment|test]] is to place two drops of olive oil into a glass of water. If the drops remain separated, the test concludes there is no evil eye, but if they merge, there is. There is also a third form where in a plate full of water the "healer" places three or nine drops of oil. If the oil drops become larger and eventually dissolve in the water there is evil eye. If the drops remain separated from water in a form of a small circle there isn't. The first drops are the most important and the number of drops that dissolve in water indicate the strength of the evil eye.

There is another form of the "test" where the "healer" prepares a few cloves by piercing each one with a pin. Then she lights a candle and grabs a pinned clove with a pair of scissors. She then uses it to do the sign of the cross over the afflicted whilst the afflicted is asked to think of a person who may have given him the evil eye. Then the healer holds the clove over the flame. If the clove burns silently, there is no evil eye present; however, if the clove explodes or burns noisily, that means the person in the thoughts of the afflicted is the one who has cast the evil eye.{{Citation needed|reason=this paragraph, the preceding paragraph, and the following paragraph appear to be original research, or at least suspiciously informal|date=July 2017}} As the clove explodes, the evil eye is released from the afflicted. Cloves that burn with some noise are considered to be λόγια - words - someone foul-mouthing you that you ought to be wary of. The burned cloves are extinguished into a glass of water and are later buried in the garden along with the pins as they are considered to be contaminated. Greek people will also ward off the evil eye by saying φτου να μη σε ματιάξω! which translates to "I spit so that I won't give you the evil eye." Contrary to popular belief, the evil eye is not necessarily given by someone wishing you ill, but it stems from admiration. Since it is technically possible to give yourself the evil eye, it is advised to be humble.

The [[Church Fathers|Greek Fathers]] accepted the traditional belief in the evil eye, but attributed it to the [[Devil]] and [[envy]]. In Greek [[theology]], the evil eye or ''vaskania'' ({{lang|el|βασκανία}}) is considered harmful for the one whose envy inflicts it on others as well as for the sufferer. The [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Church]] has an ancient prayer against vaskania from the ''Megan Hieron Synekdemon'' ({{lang|el|Μέγαν Ιερόν Συνέκδημον}}) book of prayers.{{Citation needed|reason=This paragraph and the preceding two paragraphs appear to have original research or are at least suspiciously informal|date=July 2017}}

===Italy===
[[File:Fig._81_-_The_Evil_Eye_-_Elworthy.jpg|thumb|left|Various evil eye amulets from Italy such as the [[cornicello]], [[cimaruta]], and [[lunula (amulet)|lunula]] (1895).]]
The [[cornicello]], "little horn", also called the ''cornetto'' ("little horn", plural ''cornetti''), is a long, gently twisted horn-shaped amulet. Cornicelli are usually carved out of red coral or made from gold or silver. The type of horn they are intended to copy is not a curled-over sheep horn or goat horn but rather like the twisted horn of an African [[Taurotragus|eland]] or a chili pepper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Corno (Italian Horn Amulet)|url=http://www.luckymojo.com/corno.html|author=Lucky Mojo|access-date=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One idea that the [[ribaldry|ribald]] suggestions made by sexual [[symbol]]s distract the witch from the mental effort needed to successfully bestow the curse. Another is that since the effect of the eye was to dry up liquids, the drying of the phallus (resulting in male impotence) would be averted by seeking refuge in the moist female genitals. Among the ancient Romans and their cultural descendants in the Mediterranean nations, those who were not fortified with phallic charms had to make use of sexual [[gesture]]s to avoid the eye. Such gestures include scratching one's testicles (for men), as well as the ''[[mano cornuta]]'' gesture and [[List of gestures#Fig sign|the fig sign]]; a fist with the thumb pressed between the index and middle fingers, representing the phallus within the vagina. In addition to the phallic talismans, [[statue]]s of hands in these gestures, or covered with magical symbols, were carried by the Romans as talismans. In [[Latin America]], carvings of the fist with the thumb pressed between the index and middle fingers continue to be carried as good luck charms.

The wielder of the evil eye, the ''jettatore'', is described as having a striking facial appearance, high arching brows with a stark stare that leaps from his black eyes. He often has a reputation for clandestine involvement with dark powers and is the object of gossip about dealings in magic and other forbidden practices. Successful men having tremendous personal magnetism quickly gain notoriety as jettatori. [[Pope Pius IX]] was dreaded for his evil eye, and a whole cycle of stories about the disasters that happened in his wake were current in Rome during the latter decades of the 19th century. Public figures of every type, from poets to gangsters, have had their specialized abilities attributed to the power of their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Maloney, Clarence. ''The Evil Eye''.

===Malta===
The symbol of the eye, known as "l-għajn", is common on traditional fishing boats which are known as [[luzzu]].

}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain and Latin America===
The evil eye or 'Mal de Ojo' has been deeply embedded in Spanish popular culture throughout its history and Spain is the origin of this superstition in Latin America.

In [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]], infants are considered at special risk for the evil eye (see ''mal de ojo'', above) and are often given an amulet bracelet as protection, typically with an eye-like spot painted on the amulet. Another preventive measure is allowing admirers to touch the infant or child; in a similar manner, a person wearing an item of clothing that might induce envy may suggest to others that they touch it or some other way dispel envy.

One traditional cure in rural Mexico involves a ''[[curandero]]'' (folk healer) sweeping a raw chicken egg over the body of a victim to absorb the power of the person with the evil eye. The egg is later broken into a glass with water and placed under the bed of the patient near the head. Sometimes it is checked immediately because the egg appears as if it has been cooked. When this happens it means that the patient did have Mal De Ojo. Somehow the Mal De Ojo has transferred to the egg and the patient immediately gets well. (Fever, pain and diarrhea, nausea/vomiting goes away instantly) In the traditional Hispanic culture of the Southwestern United States and some parts of Mexico, the egg may be passed over the patient in a cross-shaped pattern all over the body, while reciting ''The Lord's Prayer''. The egg is also placed in a glass with water, under the bed and near the head, sometimes it is examined right away or in the morning and if the egg looks like it has been cooked then it means that they did have Mal de Ojo and the patient will start feeling better. Sometimes if the patient starts getting ill and someone knows that they had stared at patient, usually a child, if the person who stared goes to the child and touches them, the child's illness goes away immediately so the Mal De Ojo energy is released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/medical/med_1.htm |title=Medical Anthropology: Explanations of Illness |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817130521/http://anthro.palomar.edu/medical/med_1.htm |archivedate=2012-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some parts of [[South America]] the act of ''ojear'', which could be translated as ''to give someone the evil eye'', is an involuntary act. Someone may ''ojear'' babies, animals and inanimate objects just by staring and admiring them. This may produce illness, discomfort or possibly death on babies or animals and failures on inanimate objects like cars or houses. It's a common belief that since this is an involuntary act made by people with the ''heavy look'', the proper way of protection is by attaching a red ribbon to the animal, baby or object, in order to attract the gaze to the ribbon rather than to the object intended to be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revistatabularasa.org/numero_dos/florez.pdf |title=El ''Mal de Ojo'' de la Etnografía Clásica y ''La Limpia'' Posmoderna |author=Flórez, Franz |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727213519/http://www.revistatabularasa.org/numero_dos/florez.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brazil====
Brazilians generally will associate ''mal-olhado'', ''mau-olhado'' ("act of giving a bad look") or ''olho gordo'' ("fat eye" i.e. "gluttonous eye") with envy or jealousy on domestic and garden plants (that, after months or years of health and beauty, will suddenly weaken, wither and die, with no apparent signs of pest, after the visitation of a certain friend or relative), attractive hair and less often economic or romantic success and family harmony.

Unlike in most cultures ''mal-olhado'' is not seen to be something that risks young babies. "Pagans" or non-baptized children are instead assumed to be at risk from ''bruxas'' (witches), that have malignant intention themselves rather than just ''mal-olhado''. It probably reflects the Galician folktales about the ''[[meiga]]s'' or Portuguese magas, (witches), as Colonial Brazil was primarily settled by [[Portuguese people]], in numbers greater than all Europeans to settle pre-independence United States. Those ''bruxas'' are interpreted to have taken the form of moths, often very dark, that disturb children at night and take away their energy. For that reason, Christian Brazilians often have amulets in the form of crucifixes around, beside or inside beds where children sleep.

Nevertheless, older children, especially boys, that fulfill the cultural ideals of behaving extremely well (for example, having no problems whatsoever in eating well a great variety of foods, being obedient and respectful toward adults, kind, polite, studious, and demonstrating no bad blood with other children or their siblings) who unexpectedly turn into problematic adolescents or adults (for example lacking good health habits, extreme laziness or lacking motivation towards their life goals, having eating disorders, or being prone to delinquency), are said to have been victims of ''mal-olhado'' coming from parents of children whose behavior was not as admirable.

Amulets that protect against ''mal-olhado'' tend to be generally resistant, mildly to strongly toxic and dark plants in specific and strategic places of a garden or the entry to a house. Those include ''comigo-ninguém-pode'' ("against-me-nobody-cans"), ''[[Dieffenbachia]]'' (the dumbcane), ''espada-de-são-jorge'' ("St. George's sword"), ''[[Sansevieria trifasciata]]'' (the snake plant or mother-in-law's tongue) and ''guiné'' ("Guinea"), among [[:pt:Petiveria tetrandra|various other names]], ''[[Petiveria alliacea]]'' (the guinea henweed). For those lacking in space or wanting to "sanitize" specific places, they may all be planted together in a single ''sete ervas'' ("seven [lucky] herbs") pot, that will also include ''arruda'' ([[Ruta graveolens|common rue]]), ''pimenteira'' ([[Capsicum annuum]]), ''manjericão'' ([[basil]]) and ''alecrim'' ([[rosemary]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vidaeestilo.terra.com.br/esoterico/interna/0,,OI4880508-EI14322,00-Conheca+o+poder+e+a+protecao+das+sete+ervas.html |title=Conheça o poder e a proteção das sete ervas |author=Guizetti, Franco |language= pt |accessdate=Jan 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Though the last four ones should not be used for their common culinary purposes by humans.)
Other popular amulets against evil eye include: the use of mirrors, on the outside of your home's front door, or also inside your home facing your front door; an elephant figurine with its back to the front door; and coarse salt, placed in specific places at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://revista.zap.com.br/imoveis/proteja-sua-casa-do-mau-olhado/|title=Proteja sua casa do mau olhado|last=Caires|first=Olivia|language= Portuguese|accessdate=February 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mal ojo often occurs without the dimension of envy, but insofar as envy is a part of ojo, it is a variant of this underlying sense of insecurity and relative vulnerability to powerful, hostile forces in the environment. In her study of medical attitudes in the Santa Clara Valley of California, Margaret Clark arrives at essentially the same conclusion: "Among the Spanish-speaking folk of Sal si Puedes, the patient is regarded as a passive and innocent victim of malevolent forces in his environment. These forces may be witches, evil spirits, the consequences of poverty, or virulent bacteria that invade his body. The scapegoat may be a visiting social worker who unwittingly 'cast the evil eye'&amp;nbsp;... Mexican folk concepts of disease are based in part on the notion that people can be victimized by the careless or malicious behavior of others".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Another aspect of the mal ojo syndrome in Ixtepeji is a disturbance of the hot-cold equilibrium in the victim. According to folk belief, the bad effects of an attack result from the "hot" force of the aggressor entering the child's body and throwing it out of balance. Currier has shown how the Mexican hot-cold system is an unconscious folk model of social relations upon which social anxieties are projected. According to Currier, "the nature of Mexican peasant society is such that each individual must continuously attempt to achieve a balance between two opposing social forces: the tendency toward intimacy and that toward withdrawal. [It is therefore proposed] that the individual's continuous preoccupation with achieving a balance between 'heat' and 'cold' is a way of reenacting, in symbolic terms, a fundamental activity in social relations."&lt;ref&gt;Maloney, Clarence. The Evil Eye. New York: Columbia UP, 1976. p. 184. {{ISBN|0-231-04006-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
{{Main article|Nazar Battu}}
In the northern states of India, like Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, the evil eye is called "Drishti" (meaning gaze or vision) or more commonly as ''Buri Nazar''. A charm bracelet, tattoo or other object ([[Nazar battu]]), or a slogan ([[Chashme Baddoor (slogan)]]), may be used to ward-off the evil eye. Some truck owners write the slogan to ward off the evil eye: "buri nazar wale tera muh kala" ("O evil-eyed one, may your face turn black").

In general in India, if gone through time up to historical myths, babies and newborn infants will have their eye adorned with kajal, or eyeliner. This would be black, as it is believed in India that black wards off the evil eye or any evil auras.
In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, people call it as 'Disti' or 'Drusti'. To remove Disti people follow several methods based on their culture/area. Items used to remove Disti either Rock salt or Red chilies or Oiled cloth. Taking one of this item, people remove Disti by rotating their hand with one of the item above around the person who affected by Disti and they will burn the item.&lt;ref name="JackStephen2013"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Amariglio, Jack |author2=Cullenberg, Stephen E |author3=Ruccio, David F | title=Post-Modernism, Economics and Knowledge | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8-LqpYBnDOkC&amp;pg=PA217 |year= 2013 | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-1-134-83668-0 | pages=217–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In 1946, the American [[magic (paranormal)|magician]] [[Henri Gamache]] published a text called ''Terrors of the Evil Eye Exposed!'' (later reprinted as ''Protection against Evil''), which offers directions to defend oneself against the evil eye.&lt;ref&gt;Gamache, Henri (1946) ''Terrors of the Evil Eye Exposed'' Raymond Publishing, New York, {{OCLC|9989883}}; reprinted in 1969 as ''Protection Against Evil'' Dorene, Dallas, Texas, {{OCLC|39132235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media and press coverage==
&lt;!-- This shouldn't be its own section; it should be naturally integrated into the rest of the article where appropriate --&gt;
In some cultures over-complimenting is said to cast a curse. So does envy. Since ancient times such maledictions have been collectively called the evil eye. According to the book ''The Evil Eye'' by folklorist [[Alan Dundes]],&lt;ref&gt;Dundes, Alan (ed.) (1992) ''The Evil Eye: A Casebook'' [[University of Wisconsin Press]], Madison, Wisconsin, {{ISBN|0-299-13334-6}}; originally published in 1981 by Garland Publishing, New York&lt;/ref&gt; the belief's premise is that an individual can cause harm simply by looking at another's person or property. However, protection is easy to come by with talismans that can be worn, carried, or hung in homes, most often incorporating the contours of a human eye. In Aegean countries, people with light-colored eyes are thought to be particularly powerful, and amulets in Greece and Turkey are usually blue orbs. Indians and Jews use charms with palm-forward hands with an eye in the center; Italians employ horns, phallic shapes meant to distract spell casters.&lt;ref&gt;Rizzo, Johnna (April 2013) ''National Geographic Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Federation of European Carnival Cities''' (FECC) was founded in 1980 and has been registered in the Court of Luxembourg. Member cities, organization and individual members are engaged in producing popular celebrations or [[carnivals]] which represent an authentic [[Masquerade ceremony|masquerade]] or [[parade]] of a people's cultural identity. The General membership meets twice each year generally at the end of May and in October. [[File:FECC-logo.png|right]]

== History ==
On the occasion of the 700th anniversary of [[Amsterdam]] (The Nederlands), Carnival Princes from all over the world met each other in the Amsterdam RAI congress centre in November 1975. The Amsterdam Carnival Association, governed by Mr.[[Henk van der Kroon]] was called "Amstelpieren &amp; Brokkerijders."  The big event brought an unprecedented number of Carnival Associations from different countries together. The guests of honour included Her Royal Highness [[Princess Margriet of the Netherlands]] as well as diplomats and dignitaries from afar including [[Brazil]], [[Greece]], [[Germany]] and [[Belgium]]. This unique event is widely recognized as the starting point for the lasting contacts and exchanges between associations and cities that has become the FECC.

In 1980, international carnival associations met in Patras (Greece), again under the initiative of the Amsterdam Carnival Association Ämstelpieren &amp; Bfrokkerijders. It is generally accepted that the FECC (Foundation of European Carnival) came into existence during this meeting. At the 5th reunion in Kos-Patmos (Greece), which took place in 1985, a membership was introduced and it was decided to drawn up rules and bylaws. The first countries that became a member of the Foundation were Belgium, Netherlands, [[Luxembourg]], [[England]] and [[Malta]]. Articles of association were formulated and the creation of FECC was registered in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Directly following the 1987 7th reunion in Malta, the Belgian members founded their own section FECC-Belgium with its own governing board. In 1988 FECC-Germany founded their own section as did FECC-Netherlands and FECC –Luxembourg. The first elected International President was Mr. Henk van der Kroon.

Throughout the year the International President and other Board Members travel to member cities and interested Carnivals to learn, educate and often officiate at the ceremonies surrounding what is often the most important annual event for the community and even country. The FECC is a global organization holding its first annual convention outside the Mediterranean in the twin island Republic of Trinidad and Tobago in 1987. Many Carnivals, particularly those in Eastern Europe, have grown up under the mentorship of FECC engagement. Since its founding, the FECC has been the only unswerving organization consistently speaking for the interests and concerns of Carnival organizations. Representatives from Carnival organizations in over 50 countries are members and annual conventions generally have several Mayors seeking ways to bring more international recognition and culturally oriented tourists to their festivals.

==Annual Carnival City Congress==
Once a year, all FECC members: cities, associations and individual members are invited to an international assembly. This convention is organized by a member-city and takes place every year in a different country.
The convention lasts 1 week end takes place between end mid-May and mid- June. These conventions enjoy a lot of interest: every year, participants from more than 20 countries are present.
During these annual conventions, the members get an international forum which enables them to promote their carnival and their town on the occasion of seminars and workshops.

Direct personal contacts with the numerous participants can also increase the international publicity of a member's carnival and/of town.
The organizers of the convention moreover, use these gatherings to show the participants a few tourist attractions and places of interest of their town and the surrounding area. 

The 11 October 1980 marks the founding of the FECC and it is observed by the FECC membership with a '''Dies Natalis''' celebration. This weekend gathering is hosted by a member city.

'''Frances Anne Edgeworth''' (née Beaufort) (1769–1865), known as '''Fanny''', was an Irish botanical artist and memoirist. She was the stepmother and confidant of the author [[Maria Edgeworth]].&lt;ref name=Loeber&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loeber|first1=Rolf|last2=Loeber|first2=Magda|last3=Mullin Burnham|first3=Anne|title=EDGEWORTH, Mrs Frances (Fanny) Anne|url=http://www.lgif.ie/authorDetails.action;jsessionid=913A146D655DFC45135A038A6F87AF0E?authorId=702|website=An Electronic Version of A Guide to Irish Fiction 1650 – 1900|publisher=An Foras Feasa, NUI Maynooth|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Desmond|first1=Ray|title=Dictionary of British And Irish Botantists And Horticulturalists Including plant collectors, flower painters and garden designers|date=1994|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=London|isbn=9780850668438|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Frances Anne Beaufort was born at ''Flower Hill'' in Navan, County Meath, in 1769.&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Patricia|title=Irish Botanical Illustrators &amp; Flower Painters|date=2000|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|location=Suffolk|isbn=9781851493579|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of four children of [[Daniel Augustus Beaufort]] and Mary Beaufort (née Waller). Her brother was Admiral [[Francis Beaufort]], and her sisters were the writers [[Harriet Henrietta Beaufort|Harriet]] and Louisa. She was educated at Mrs Terson's School at [[Portarlington, County Laois|Portarlington]], learning writing, drawing, dancing and French. She studied art further under the English artist Bowring, Dublin-based Francis Robert West, and Raymond Deshouilleres of London.&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt; In 1788, she accompanied her father on a tour of Ireland, recording archaeological sites and objects. The family lived in London from 1789 to 1790.&lt;ref name=Loeber /&gt;

==Later life==
On 31 May 1798, she married [[Richard Lovell Edgeworth]], becoming his fourth wife and stepmother of Maria Edgeworth and her 11 siblings. Edgeworth and Maria, who was a year older than her stepmother, would become close to Maria, describing her as "her beloved friend and mother".&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt; There is evidence that Edgeworth was a writer like her sisters and stepdaughter, but her work was largely overlooked. A visitor to [[Edgeworthstown]] in 1813, James Hall, makes reference to her as a "successful" author, with a published novel, ''What You Choose to Call it'' or ''The Good Wife''. This attribution was repeated in 1884, but is not mentioned by the family or their papers. It is known that Edgeworth wrote a memoir of Maria Edgeworth, containing selected letters. Some of Edgeworth's letters are held by the [[National Library of Ireland]],&lt;ref name=Loeber /&gt; and in the [[Bodleian Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Catalogue of the papers of Maria Edgeworth (1768–1849), and the Edgeworth family, 17th–19th century|url=http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/online/1500-1900/edgeworth/edgeworth.html#edgeworth.A.1|website=University of Oxford, Bodleian Library|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Edgeworths went on to have six children together: Frances Maria Edgeworth (1799 – 4 February 1848), Harriet Edgeworth (1801–1889), Sophia Edgeworth (1803–1836), Lucy Jane Edgeworth (1805–1897), Francis Beaufort Edgeworth (1809–1846), and [[Michael Pakenham Edgeworth]] (24 May 1812 – 1881).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frances Ann Beaufort|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p17345.htm#i173444|website=The Peerage|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedman|first1=Jean E.|last2=Schroeder-Lein|first2=Glenna R.|title=Ways of Wisdom: Moral Education in the Early National Period|date=2001|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Georgia|isbn=9780820322520|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McWilliams|first1=Brendan|title=Illustrious family came from a faulty line|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/illustrious-family-came-from-a-faulty-line-1.1118696|accessdate=10 July 2015|agency=The Irish Times|date=30 November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edgeworth died on 10 February 1865 at Edgeworthstown, County Longford.&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt; Amongst her grandchildren is the philosopher and political economist, [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barbe|first1=Lluis|title=Francis Ysidro Edgeworth: A Portrait with Family and Friends|date=2010|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|location=Cheltenham|isbn=9781849803229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic work==
Edgeworth was a contemporary of other botanical women artists of the time, such as [[Mary Delaney]].&lt;ref name=Kelley&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kelley|first1=Theresa M.|title=Clandestine Marriage: Botany and Romantic Culture|date=2012|publisher=JHU Press|location=Maryland|isbn=9781421405179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father's biographer, Ellison, describes her as "an exceptionally talented artist in oils and crayons", though Edgeworth also worked in watercolour. She illustrated her father's 1792 ''A New Map of Ireland''.&lt;ref name=Loeber /&gt;

After her marriage, Edgeworth helped in the illustration of her husband's engineering projects. She produced illustrations for Maria Edgeworth's ''The Parent's Assistant'', which were used in the third edition. It was the production of these drawings that led to Richard Lovell Edgeworth and Frances meeting and subsequently marrying.&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt; The private collection at Edgeworthstown House holds an album containing some of these drawings. The [[Huntington Library]] in California has a volume of her botanical watercolours of plants from her home and around Ireland, dating from 1798 to 1807.&lt;ref name=Loeber /&gt; These botanical paintings are of well-known plants from her home and surroundings and consist of 101 drawings. The drawings are very detailed and show a keen interest in botany. Edgeworth includes the Linnaean names, with her primary interest being in a complex group of plants, the [[Cryptogam]]s.&lt;ref name=Kelley /&gt;

[[File:Frederic-Clay-ILN.jpg|right|thumb|Frederic Clay]] 
'''Frederic Emes Clay''' (3 August 1838 – 24 November 1889) was an English composer known principally for his music written for the stage. Clay, a great friend of [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s, wrote four [[comic opera]]s with [[W. S. Gilbert]] and introduced the two men.

While working as a civil servant in the Treasury department, Clay began composing seriously in the early 1860s.  His first big success was ''[[Ages Ago]]'' (1869), a short comic opera with a libretto by [[W. S. Gilbert]], for the small [[Gallery of Illustration]].  Other pieces with Gilbert and others followed, and Clay turned to composing full-time after his father died in 1873.  That year, he composed a successful opera-bouffe version of ''[[The Black Crook]]'' for the [[Alhambra Theatre]].  Clay's last piece with Gilbert was  ''[[Princess Toto]]'' (1875).  He also composed two [[cantata]]s.  His last two works were both successful operas composed in 1883, ''The Merry Duchess'' and ''The Golden Ring''.  He then suffered a stroke that paralysed him at age 44.

==Life and career==
Clay was born in Paris&lt;ref name="TBDP1"&gt;"Death of Sir Frederic Clay", ''The Birmingham Daily Post'', 29 November 1889, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; to English parents, [[James Clay (author)|James Clay]] (1804–1873), a member of parliament, and his wife, Eliza Camilla Woolrych.  Clay was the fourth of six brothers and sisters.  His father was celebrated as a player of [[whist]] and the author of a treatise on that subject, as well as an amateur composer.  His mother also had a musical background, as her mother had been an opera singer.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Knowles, Christopher.  [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5559 "Clay, Frederic Emes (1838–1889)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 10 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Clay was educated at home by private tutors in London, studying piano and violin, and then music composition under [[Bernhard Molique]] and, in 1863, with [[Moritz Hauptmann]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany.&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;Sullivan, Arthur.  [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gilbert/plays/ages_ago/clay.html "Frederic Clay (1838–1889)",] ''Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', reprinted at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a civil servant in the Treasury department while also pursuing composing.&lt;ref name="ERA1"&gt;"Death of Mr Frederic Clay", ''The Era'', 30 November 1889, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of his father in 1873, his inheritance enabled him to become a full-time composer.&lt;ref name=Scowcroft&gt;Scowcroft, Philip L.  [http://www.musicweb-international.com/garlands/101.htm A 101st Garland of British Light Music Composers], Classical Music Web, MusicWeb-International.com&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of some songs, hymns, instrumental pieces and two [[cantata]]s, his compositions were nearly all written for the stage.  In the mid-1860s, Clay and his friend [[Arthur Sullivan]] became frequent guests at the home of [[John Scott Russell]].  By about 1865, Clay became engaged to Scott Russell's youngest daughter Alice, and Sullivan wooed the middle daughter Rachel.  The Scott Russells welcomed the engagement of Alice to Clay, but he broke it off.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 87; Jacobs, p. 53.  The Scott Russells forbade the relationship between Sullivan and Rachel, because Sullivan had uncertain financial prospects, although Rachel continued to see him covertly.  At some point in 1868, Sullivan started a simultaneous (and secret) affair with the eldest daughter, Louise, but both relationships had ceased by early 1869.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
[[File:Ages Ago.png|left|thumb|300px|A scene from ''[[Ages Ago]]'' in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'']]
Clay wrote his first short play for the amateur stage in 1859 called '''The Pirate's Isle'', and completed the short comic play ''Out of Sight'' the following year.&lt;ref name="ERA1"/&gt; His first professionally produced piece was an opera entitled ''Court and Cottage'', with a libretto by [[Tom Taylor]], which was produced at [[Covent Garden Theatre]] in 1862.  In 1865, for the same theatre, he composed another opera, the unsuccessful ''Constance'' (1865), with a libretto by [[Thomas William Robertson]].&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, p. 16, says: "Constance was written to a rather 'heavy' libretto. ... It was a tale of love and patriotism set in Poland under the Russians – something of a Polish ''Tosca'', but with a happy ending when the hero and heroine are rescued first by a singing [[vivandiere]] and then by the Polish army. The music ... was noted as being promising if rather light and, after being performed eighteen times as a curtain-raiser to the Covent Garden pantomime of ''Cinderella'', it sank into obscurity."  The score is available at the [[National Library of Scotland]].&lt;/ref&gt; With [[B. C. Stephenson]], he wrote three pieces played by amateurs: ''The Pirate's Isle'', ''Out of Sight'' and ''The Bold Recruit'' (1868), and with [[W. S. Gilbert]] he wrote ''[[Ages Ago]]'' (1869) for [[Thomas German Reed]]'s [[Gallery of Illustration]].&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; This piece ran for 350 performances and was revived several times.&lt;ref name=Scowcroft/&gt; Clay introduced Gilbert to Arthur Sullivan during a rehearsal for ''Ages Ago''.&lt;ref&gt;Crowther, Andrew, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/ages_ago/crowther_analysis.html Analysis of Ages Ago] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903092123/http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/ages_ago/crowther_analysis.html |date=3 September 2006 }}, The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Bold Recruit'' was revived at a benefit by German Reed at the [[Gallery of Illustration]] in 1870 as a companion piece to ''Ages Ago''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', 24 July 1870, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

These were followed by ''[[The Gentleman in Black]]'' (1870, also with Gilbert), ''In Possession'' (1871, also for German Reed), ''[[Happy Arcadia]]'' (1872, with Gilbert), ''Oriana'' (1873, with a libretto by [[James Albery]]), ''Green Old Age'' and ''Cattarina'' (both 1874, with libretti by [[Robert Reece]]), ''[[Princess Toto]]'' (1875, the last collaboration between Clay and Gilbert), and ''Don Quixote'' (1876).&lt;ref name=Scowcroft/&gt;  ''Ages Ago'' (a one-act piece) and ''Princess Toto'' (a three-act [[comic opera]]) are considered to be among Clay's most tuneful and attractive works.  ''[[The Times]]'' wrote that the music of ''Princess Toto'' "is probably surpassed by no modern English work of the kind for gaiety and melodious charm."&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;Obituary, ''The Times'', 29 November 1889, p. 5, col. F&lt;/ref&gt;

Clay also composed part of the score for the spectacle ''Babil and Bijou'' (1872, also for German Reed)&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; and the successful opera-bouffe version of ''[[The Black Crook]]'' (1873 based on the same source material as the earlier American musical of the same name and starring [[Kate Santley]]), both of which were produced with success at the [[Alhambra Theatre]].  He also furnished incidental music for a revival of ''[[Twelfth Night]]''.&lt;ref name="ERA1"/&gt;

[[File:ClaySullivan.jpg|thumb|right|Clay, [[Seymour Egerton, 4th Earl of Wilton|Seymour Egerton]] and [[Arthur Sullivan|Sullivan]], 1860s]]

===Cantatas and later career===
Clay's two cantatas were ''The Knights of the Cross'' (1866) and ''Lalla Rookh'' (containing perhaps Clay's best-known song, "I'll sing thee songs of Araby" and also "Still this golden lull"), which was produced successfully at the Brighton Festival in 1877.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; Clay had difficulty finding work in London and moved to America.  There he met with only mixed success and returned to England in 1881.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; His last works were ''The Merry Duchess'' (1883) at the [[Royalty Theatre]], starring [[Kate Santley]] and in which [[Louie Henri]] also appeared,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qUyGtqatz2gC&amp;pg=PA72 Information about ''The Merry Duchess'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Golden Ring'' (starring [[Marion Hood]]) (1883), both with words by [[G. R. Sims]].  The latter was written for the reopening of the Alhambra, which had been burned to the ground the year before.&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; These shows were both successful and showed an artistic advance upon Clay's previous work.&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, pp. 228 and 230&lt;/ref&gt;

Clay's friend, Sir Arthur Sullivan, wrote: "In all his works Clay showed a natural gift of graceful melody and a feeling for rich harmonic colouring. [His songs included] 'She wandered down the mountain side,' 'Long ago' and 'The Sands of Dee'".&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; Other songs that achieved popularity are "Gipsy John" and "Who Knows".&lt;ref name=Scowcroft/&gt;&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

After conducting the second performance of ''The Golden Ring'' in December 1883, Clay suffered a stroke that paralysed him and cut short his productive life.&lt;ref name="TBDP1"/&gt; In 1889 at the age of 51, he was found drowned in his bath at the home of his sisters in [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Great Marlow]], England, presumably a suicide.  He was buried in [[Brompton cemetery]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

A '''gaffer''' in the [[motion picture industry]] and on a [[television crew]] is the head [[electrician]], responsible for the execution (and sometimes the design) of the [[lighting]] plan for a production. The term gaffer originally related to the moving of overhead equipment to control lighting levels using a [[wiktionary:gaff|gaff]].   The gaffer's assistant is the [[best boy]].&lt;ref name="Taub153"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gaffers, Grips, and Best Boys |last=Taub |first=Eric |year=1994 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=New York |isbn=0-312-11276-9 |page=153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the gaffer is credited as [[Lighting technician|Chief Lighting Technician]] (CLT).

The term has been used for the chief electrician in films since the 1930s.  The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] has a citation from 1936;&lt;ref name=OED&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] accessed 15 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; a 1929 book on motion picture production also uses the term.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Eunice McCarthy, The Hands of Hollywood, 1929: 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gaffer is responsible for managing lighting, including associated resources such as labour, lighting instruments and electrical equipment under the direction of the [[Director of Photography]] (the DP or DOP) or, in television, the Lighting Director (LD).

The DP/LD is responsible for the overall lighting design, but delegates the implementation of the design to the gaffer and the [[key grip]]. The key grip is the head [[Grip (job)|grip]], in charge of the labour and non-electrical equipment used to support and modify the lighting. Grip equipment includes stands, [[Flag (lighting)|flags]] and [[Gobo (lighting)|gobos]]. The gaffer will usually have an assistant called a [[best boy]] and, depending on the size of the job, crew members who are called "set lighting technicians" or "[[lighting technician|electricians]]", although not all of them are trained as [[electrician]]s in the usual sense of the term.

Although  [[gaffer tape]] is used within the film/TV Industry as a strong cloth-backed adhesive tape, many other types of tape are also used, such as paper tape, [[pressure-sensitive tape]] (A.K.A. snot tape), [[electrical tape]], J-LAR, and cloth tape. Gaffer tape is typically utilized by set lighting technicians under the supervision of, and not directly by, a gaffer.

'''''Game for Vultures''''' is a 1979 British [[thriller film]] starring [[Richard Harris]], [[Joan Collins]] and [[Richard Roundtree]]. It was directed by [[James Fargo]] and based on a novel by [[Michael Hartmann (judge)|Michael Hartmann]] set during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]].

==Plot==
During the late 1970s, as the [[Rhodesian Bush War]] reaches its height, [[Arms trafficking|arms dealer]] David Swansey (Richard Harris) is a "sanctions busting" specialist, one of many who keeps the [[Rhodesian Security Forces]] supplied through black market purchases despite an extensive international arms embargo. Swansey's latest assignment is to arrange the illicit purchase of military helicopters, which he acquires in the form of surplus [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|Bell UH-1]]s being auctioned from a [[United States Air Force]] base in [[West Germany]]. However, word of this transaction is soon leaked to a foreign office of the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU), which applies strong political pressure in an attempt to kill the deal in its cradle. Due to this, the helicopters are barred from reaching Rhodesia and instead diverted to neighbouring [[South West Africa]].

Meanwhile, Gideon Marunga (Roundtree) is a guerrilla fighter in the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA), ZANU's armed wing. Marunga learns that the South West African authorities are going to allow Swansey and the [[Rhodesian Special Air Service]] to stage a mock raid on the airfield where the helicopters are being stored, with the intention of loading them onto [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47 Dakotas]] bound for Rhodesia. On the day of the raid, Marunga arrives at the airfield and stalls the Rhodesian troops, while his accomplices succeed in destroying half of the helicopters. In the ensuing battle he comes face to face with Swansey, and the two men share a weary moment of reflection on their stalemate before abruptly parting ways.

The international fallout from the helicopter affair exposes Swansey's illegal activities and he finds himself unable to continue conducting business outside Rhodesia. He decides to permanently settle there and pursue a normal life, but is immediately conscripted into the security forces. The film closes as Marunga and Swansey confront each other on the battlefield again&amp;mdash;this time through the sights of their rifles.

==Production==
''Game for Vultures'' was the first British film about the Rhodesian Bush War.&lt;ref name="black"/&gt;

The film was mostly shot in South Africa, near [[Pretoria]] and [[Johannesburg]].&lt;ref name="game"&gt;BRIEFLY South Africa bans film
The Globe and Mail [Toronto, Ont] 1 June 1979: P.13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;THE 'AFRICAN': The Drums Are Beating in them World's Movie Studios for Black and White 'Westerns' Drums Are Beating By Bart Mills. The Washington Post (1974-Current file) [Washington, D.C] 3 June 1979: L1.&lt;/ref&gt; It was decided not to film in Rhodesia itself because of security concerns and the potential violation of sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19781030&amp;id=KUtOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Gu4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4897,6224621&amp;hl=en]&lt;/ref&gt;

"I'm not a politician", said the producer Hazel Adair. The director James Fargo concurred: "I'm not a political person at all. I never thought about Africa until I started to make a film... The audience will come away with the idea that neither side is right."&lt;ref name="africa"&gt;Filmmakers trek to Africa in search of screen adventures
Mills, Bart. Chicago Tribune (1963-Current file) [Chicago, Ill] 17 June 1979: g14.&lt;/ref&gt;

"It's a movie in which there are no real bad guys or good guys," said Fargo. "Nobody really wins in the end and everybody loses, like in the real Rhodesia."&lt;ref name="black"/&gt;

During filming in South Africa, Roundtree tried to purchase some alcoholic drinks but was refused service because of his skin colour.&lt;ref name="africa"/&gt;

==Soundtrack==
The music was composed by Tony Duhig and Jon Field, who together comprised the British group [[Jade Warrior (band)|Jade Warrior]].

==Reception==
The film was meant to have its world premiere in Johannesburg on 22 June 1979. However the film was banned by South African government censors, who deemed it a threat to state security.&lt;ref name="game"/&gt;

Though generally well-written and produced, ''Game for Vultures'' was not a massive commercial or critical success. Some critics condemned the apparent bias of the plot, which ran counter to the traditionally accepted view of Rhodesia's predominantly white government as being a racially oppressive one, while its black nationalist opponents were widely regarded as freedom fighters representing a just cause.

In addition, this film was overtaken by actual events, as the war came to an end before the film reached wide distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop ushers in new rule
The Irish Times (1921-Current File) [Dublin, Ireland] 1 June 1979: 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  It saw some success in video sales, on [[VHS]] and in a [[DVD region 2|DVD Region 2]] release.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3439">'''''Gangster Stories''''' was a controversial [[pulp magazine]] of the early 1930s. It featured [[hardboiled]] crime fiction that glorified the gun-toting [[gangsters]] of the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] era. It was published by [[Harold Hersey]], as part of his [[Good Story Magazine Company]] pulp chain. The inaugural issue was dated November 1929;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gang Pulp|url=http://offtrailpublications.com/gangster.html|accessdate=21 February 2016|work=Off Trail Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; the final issue was dated November 1932.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philsp.com/mags/gangster_stories.html Galactic Central]&lt;/ref&gt; When Hersey sold his assets to another company, ''Gangster Stories'' was continued under the title ''[[Greater Gangster Stories]]'', under which it lasted through the May 1934 issue.

''Gangster Stories'' (and its companion, ''[[Racketeer Stories]]'') quickly came under censorship pressure in [[New York (state)|New York]] state, instigated by [[John S. Sumner]] of the [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]], a state entity empowered to recommend obscenity cases to prosecutorial authorities. Hersey was forced to agree to abide by certain rules, e.g. not letting gangsters triumph over lawmen.&lt;ref&gt;Hersey, Harold. ''Pulpwood Editor''. [[Frederick A. Stokes]], 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John; editor. ''Gang Pulp''. Off-Trail Publications, 2008. {{ISBN|978-1-935031-00-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fiction in ''Gangster Stories'' (and ''[[Racketeer Stories]]'') constitutes a unique genre. Though properly categorized as [[crime fiction]], the emphasis was on action and gunplay. The stories only tangentially resemble the traditional [[detective fiction|detective story]] or [[mystery fiction|mystery]]. A typical ''Gangster Stories'' epic featured rival mobs shooting it out in the streets with [[Thompson submachine gun|Tommy guns]].

Perhaps the most popular author in the magazine was [[Anatole Feldman]], with his stories of the [[Chicago]] mobster [[Big Nose Serrano]]. Playwright Feldman initially based Serrano on the character of [[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]. The first Big Nose story, "Serrano of the Stockyards" (''Gangster Stories'', May 1930), roughly followed the plot and characters of the famous play. Thereafter, Serrano evolved into an unlikely crusader against the social ills of the [[Great Depression|Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Anatole &amp; [[Will Murray (writer)|Will Murray]] (introductions). ''The Gangland Sagas of Big Nose Serrano: Volumes 1-3''. Off-Trail Publications, 2008-09. {{ISBN|978-1-935031-01-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-935031-04-8}}, {{ISBN|978-1-935031-07-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another popular author was former newspaper reporter [[Margie Harris]], a clever writer with an ear for the distinctive vernacular of the mobs. Other authors include [[Arthur J. Burks]], former [[Sing Sing]] convict [[Henry Leverage]], [[C. B. Yorke]], [[Walt S. Dinghall]], [[George Bruce (screenwriter)|George Bruce]], [[Richard Credicott]],&lt;ref&gt;Credicott, Richard. ''Crime Stories by Richard Credicott'', Off-Trail Publications, 2011. {{ISBN|978-1935031178}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[D .B. McCandless]].

[[File:Google Bomb Miserable Failure.png|thumb|300px|right|An example of Google bombing in 2006 that caused the search query "miserable failure" to be associated with [[George W. Bush]] and [[Michael Moore]].]]
The terms '''Google bomb''' and '''Googlewashing''' refer to the practice of causing a [[website]] to rank highly in [[web search engine]] results for irrelevant, unrelated or off-topic search terms by linking heavily. In contrast, [[search engine optimization]] (SEO) is the practice of improving the [[search engine]] listings of web pages for ''relevant'' search terms.

Google-bombing is done for either business, political, or comedic purposes (or some combination thereof).&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom Jr.|last=Zeller|title=A New Campaign Tactic: Manipulating Google Data|work=[[The New York Times]] (Late Edition (East Coast))|date=October 26, 2006|page=A.20|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/26/us/politics/26googlebomb.html}} (Note: payment required, weblink goes to abstract.)&lt;!-- replace this with a free source --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Google's [[PageRank|search-rank algorithm]] ranks pages higher for a particular search phrase if enough other pages linked to it use similar [[anchor text]]. By January 2007, however, Google tweaked its search algorithm to counter popular Google bombs such as "miserable failure" leading to [[George W. Bush]] and [[Michael Moore]]; now, search results list pages about the Google bomb itself.&lt;ref name="googlebomb halt"/&gt; Since no later than 21 June 2015, the first result in a Google search for "miserable failure" is the Wikipedia article defining ''Google bomb''.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150621133110/https://www.google.com/search?q=miserable+failure&amp;gws_rd=ssl&lt;/ref&gt; Used both as a [[verb]] and a [[noun]], "Google bombing" was introduced to the ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary]]'' in May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/050516-184202|title=Google and Google Bombing Now Included New Oxford American Dictionary|work=Search Engine Watch|first=Gary|last=Price|date=May 16, 2005|accessdate=January 29, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127123936/http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/050516-184202|archivedate=January 27, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;!--Search Engine Watch article] on addition of "Google Bomb" to dictionary--&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Google bombing is related to [[spamdexing]], the practice of deliberately modifying [[HTML]] to increase the chance of a website being placed close to the beginning of search engine results, or to influence the category to which the page is assigned in a misleading or dishonest manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first=Zoltán | last=Gyöngyi | authorlink1=Zoltán Gyöngyi | first2=Hector | last2=Garcia-Molina | contribution=Web spam taxonomy | contribution-url=http://airweb.cse.lehigh.edu/2005/gyongyi.pdf | title=Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Adversarial Information Retrieval on the Web (AIRWeb), 2005 in The 14th International World Wide Web Conference (WWW 2005) May 10, (Tue)-14 (Sat), 2005, Nippon Convention Center (Makuhari Messe), Chiba, Japan. | year=2005 | publisher=ACM Press | place=New York, NY | isbn=1-59593-046-9 | authorlink2=Hector Garcia-Molina }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Googlewashing'' was coined by [[Andrew Orlowski]] in 2003 to describe the use of [[media manipulation]] to change the perception of a term, or push out competition from [[search engine results page]]s (SERPs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Orlowski|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Orlowski|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/04/03/antiwar_slogan_coined_repurposed/|title=Anti-war slogan coined, repurposed and Googlewashed ... in 42 days.|date=April 3, 2003|work=The Register|accessdate=January 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AdamsMcCrindle2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew A.

==History==
Google bombs date back as far as 1999, when a search for "more [[evil]] than [[Satan]] himself" resulted in the [[Microsoft]] homepage as the top result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clickz.com/google-bombs-arent-so-scary/61942/|accessdate=December 8, 2017|title=Google Bombs Aren't So Scary|first=Danny|last=Sullivan|date=March 18, 2002|work=ClickZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/incredible-google-bombs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2000 the first Google bomb with a verifiable creator was created by ''Hugedisk Men's Magazine'', a now-defunct online humor magazine, when it linked the text "dumb motherfucker" to a site selling [[George W. Bush]]-related merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,41401,00.html |last=Manjoo |first=Fahrad |title=Google Link is Bush League |date=January 25, 2001 |work=Wired News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010405062025/http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0%2C1282%2C41401%2C00.html |archivedate=April 5, 2001 |accessdate=January 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hugedisk had also unsuccessfully attempted to Google bomb an equally derogatory term to bring up an [[Al Gore]]-related site. After a fair amount of publicity the George W. Bush-related merchandise site retained lawyers and sent a [[cease and desist|cease-and-desist]] letter to ''Hugedisk'', thereby ending the Google bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/01/earlier_today_m.html|title=Remembering the First Google Bomb|first=Michael|last=Calore|author2=Scott Gilbertson|date=January 26, 2001|work=Wired News|accessdate=January 27, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070225081940/http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/01/earlier_today_m.html |archivedate = February 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam Mathes is credited with coining the term "Google bombing" when he mentioned it in an April 6, 2001 article in the online magazine ''uber.nu''. In the article Mathes details his connection of the search term "talentless hack" to the website of his friend Andy Pressman by recruiting fellow webloggers to link to his friend's page with the desired term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Adam|last=Mathes|url=http://uber.nu/2001/04/06/|title=Filler Friday: Google Bombing|date=April 6, 2001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050715083840/http://uber.nu/2001/04/06/|archivedate=July 15, 2005|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some experts forecast that the practice of Google Bombing is over, as changes to Google's algorithm over the years have minimised the effect of the technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=SEO|last=Works|url=https://www.seoworks.co.uk/end-of-the-googlebomb/|title=The end of the GoogleBomb|date=January 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses as tactical media==
The Google Bomb has been used for [[tactical media]] as a way of performing a "hit-and-run" media attack on popular topics. Such attacks include Anthony Cox's attack in 2003. He created a parody of the "404 – page not found" browser error message in response to the war in Iraq. The page looked like the error page but was titled "These Weapons of Mass Destruction cannot be displayed". This website could be found as one of the top hits on Google after the start of the war in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mushon.com/2010/03/23/interface-as-a-conflict-of-ideologies/|title=Interface as a Conflict of Ideologies|date=April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in an attempt to detract attention from the far-right group [[English Defence League]] (EDL), a parody group has been made known as "[[English Disco Lovers]]", with the expressed purpose of Google bombing the acronym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edl.me|title=EDL - English Disco Lovers NOT English Defence League - Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative meanings==
The Google bomb is often misunderstood by those in the media and publishing industry who do not retain technical knowledge of Google's ranking factors. For example, talk radio host [[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones]] has often conducted what he calls "Google bombs" by dispatching instructions to his radio/Internet listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schoff |first=Hans |url=http://hansschoff.com/mlm/google-bomb-mastering-internet-marketing-strategies |title=How to Google Bomb - Mastering Internet Marketing Strategies &amp;#124; Hans Schoff's Official Home Based Income Blog |publisher=Hansschoff.com |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512030112/http://hansschoff.com/mlm/google-bomb-mastering-internet-marketing-strategies |archivedate=May 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scuttledd.com/2011/06/the-new-activism-alex-jones-and-the-next-phase-of-the-infowar/&lt;/ref&gt; In this context the term is used to describe a rapid and massive influx of keyword searches for a particular phrase. The keyword surge gives the impression that the related content has suddenly become popular. The strategy behind this type of Google bombing is to attract attention from the larger mainstream media and influence them to publish content related to the keyword.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Google bowling==
By studying what types of ranking manipulations a search engine is using, a company can provoke a search engine into ''lowering'' the ranking of a competitor's website. This practice, known as '''Google bowling''', is often done by purchasing Google bombing services (or other [[search engine optimization|SEO]] techniques) not for one's own website, but rather for that of a competitor. The attacker provokes the search company into punishing the "offending" competitor by displaying their page further down in the search results.&lt;ref name="google-bowling"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/06/28/negative-search-google-tech-ebiz-cx_ag_0628seo.html|title=The Saboteurs Of Search|first=Andy|last=Greenberg|work=Forbes|date=June 28, 2007|accessdate=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Pedone |url=http://www.webpronews.com/expertarticles/2005/10/27/google-bowling-how-competitors-can-sabotage-you-what-google-should-do-about-it |title=Google Bowling: How Competitors Can Sabotage You; What Google Should Do About It |publisher=Webpronews.com |date=October 27, 2005 |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201020606/http://www.webpronews.com/expertarticles/2005/10/27/google-bowling-how-competitors-can-sabotage-you-what-google-should-do-about-it |archivedate=December 1, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For victims of Google bowling, it may be difficult to appeal the ranking decrease because Google avoids explaining penalties, preferring not to "educate" real offenders. If the situation is clear-cut, however, Google could lift the penalty after submitting a request for reconsideration. Furthermore, after the [[Google Penguin]] update, Google search rankings now take Google bowling into account and according to various sources, very rarely will a website be penalized due to low-quality "farm" backlinks.

==Other search engines==
Other search engines use similar techniques to rank results, so [[Yahoo!]], [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]], and [[Ask.com]] are also affected by Google bombs. A search for "[[miserable failure]]" or "failure" on September 29, 2006, brought up the official George W. Bush biography number one on Google, Yahoo!, and MSN and number two on Ask.com. On June 2, 2005, Tooter reported that George Bush was ranked first for the keyword "miserable", "failure", and "miserable failure" in both Google and Yahoo!; Google has since addressed this and disarmed the George Bush Google bomb and many others.

The [[BBC]], reporting on Google bombs in 2002, used the headline "Google Hit By Link Bombers",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1868395.stm|title=Google Hit By Link Bombers|publisher=BBC |date=March 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledging to some degree the idea of "link bombing". In 2004, [[Search Engine Watch]] suggested that the term be "link bombing" because of its application beyond Google, and continues to use that [[technical term|term]] as it is considered more accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yooter.com/blog/index.php?entry=entry050602-180255 |title=Yooter SEO blog |publisher=Yooter.com |accessdate=July 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513202317/http://www.yooter.com/blog/index.php?entry=entry050602-180255 |archivedate=May 13, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By January 2007, Google changed its indexing structure&lt;ref name="googlebomb halt"/&gt; so that Google bombs such as "miserable failure" would "typically return commentary, discussions, and articles" about the tactic itself.&lt;ref name="googlebomb halt"/&gt; Google announced the changes on its official blog.

==Motivations==

===Competitions===
In May 2004, the websites Dark Blue and SearchGuild teamed up to create what they termed the "SEO Challenge" to Google bomb the phrase "[[nigritude ultramarine]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Karch|first=Marziah|title=Google Bombs Explained|url=http://google.about.com/od/socialtoolsfromgoogle/a/googlebombatcl.htm|work=About.com|accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contest sparked controversy around the Internet, as some groups worried that [[search engine optimization]] (SEO) companies would abuse the techniques used in the competition to alter queries more relevant to the average user. This fear was offset by the belief that [[Google]] would alter their algorithm based on the methods used by the Google bombers.

In September 2004, another [[SEO contest]] was created. This time, the objective was to get the top result for the phrase "[[seraphim proudleduck]]". A large sum of money was offered to the winner, but the competition turned out to be a hoax.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

In March 2005's issue of [[.net (magazine)|''.net'' magazine]], a contest was created among five professional web developers to make their site the number-one site for the made-up phrase "crystalline incandescence".

===Political activism===
{{See also|Political Google bombs in the 2004 U.S. Presidential election}}
Some of the most famous Google bombs are also expressions of political opinions (e.g. "liar" leading to [[Tony Blair]] or "miserable failure" leading to the White House's biography of George W. Bush):

* In 2003, Steven Lerner, creator of [[Albino Blacksheep]], created a [[parody]] webpage titled "French Military Victories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/text/victories.html |title=french military victories |publisher=Albinoblacksheep.com |accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; When typed into Google, the first result (or the "I'm Feeling Lucky" result) led to a webpage resembling a Google error message, reading, "Your search – French military victories – did not match any documents. Did you mean French military ''defeats''?" The page received over 50,000 hits within 18 hours of its release. Links near the top of the page led to a simplified list of [[Military history of France|French military history]]. The only war listed as a win for the French was the French Revolution, in which they fought themselves. As of May 2, 2011, the page is no longer listed in Google's first few results for "French military victories", but several links on the list go to sites recounting the joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard J., Jr.|last=Dalton|title=Internet Parody Hands French Military a Defeat|page=A.27|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/305039401.html?dids=305039401:305039401&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT|work=Newsday|date=March 13, 2003|accessdate=February 4, 2007}} (payment required, link goes to abstract)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2003, columnist [[Dan Savage]] began his [[campaign for the neologism "santorum"|campaign to define the word "santorum"]] after former U.S. Senator [[Rick Santorum]] made several [[Santorum controversy regarding homosexuality|controversial statements]] regarding homosexuality. A search for "santorum" led to the top result being a website defining it as being related to [[anal sex]]. One search engine expert has argued that this campaign does not qualify as a Google bomb, arguing that it is instead a successful new definition for a word explained by a website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Evan |last=McMorris-Santoro |url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/with-his-campaign-lagging-rick-santorum-turns-once-again-to-dan-savage |title=With His Campaign Lagging, Rick Santorum Turns Once Again To Dan Savage |publisher=Talking Points Memo |date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[search engine optimization]])
* In 2004, Jewish writer and activist [[Daniel Sieradski]] urged visitors to his blog to link to the [[Jew|Wikipedia article for "Jew"]] in response to findings, first publicized by Steven Weinstock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Becker |first=David |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1038-5186012.html |title=Google caught in anti-Semitism flap |publisher=News.cnet.com |accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=John Brandon |url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2004/05/63380 |title=Dropping the Bomb on Google |publisher=Wired.com |accessdate=July 9, 2010 |date=May 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a search for "Jew" returned the [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] website [[Jew Watch]] at the top of the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1038_3-5186012.html |title=Google caught in anti-Semitism flap - CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was successful in displacing the site from the top result.

* In France, groups opposing the [[DADVSI]] copyright bill, proposed by minister [[Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres]], mounted a Google bombing campaign linking ''ministre blanchisseur'' ("laundering minister") to an article on Donnedieu de Vabres' conviction for [[money laundering]].

* In 2004, after the controversy that erupted in the [[Philippines]] over the allegations that President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] had cheated in the elections, the phrase "''pekeng pangulo''" ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for "fake president") was linked to her official website.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}
* In December 2004, the "''Yan Ang Pinay''" ("I am a Filipina") campaign&lt;ref&gt;[http://filipina.fil.net/ Yan Ang Filipina]&lt;/ref&gt; encouraged bloggers to self-identify as Filipina and link the word [[Filipina]] to target URLs such as the Filipina Women's Network (ffwn.org),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filipinasoul.com/2007/02/resurrecting-the-image-of-a-true-filipina/ |title=Resurrecting the image of a true Filipina |publisher=Filipina Soul |date=2007-02-14 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; to displace [[mail order bride|mail-order bride]] sites in search results.
* In 2004, ''kretyn'' ([[Polish language|Polish]] for ''moron'') and similar insults referring to stupidity were linked to websites of various Polish politicians including [[Andrzej Lepper]] and [[Roman Giertych]].

* In January 2009, a successful Google bomb was performed against the site of the [[Bulgarian government]] by a loose group of bloggers and forum users. It was discovered that by mistake, the robots.txt on the government.bg forbade the crawling of the site by indexing machines which allowed for Google bombing. The group linked the search term "failure" ({{lang-bg|провал}})  to the government site. Within a couple of days, the first search result for "провал" was the Bulgarian government's site regardless of the search results language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rene Beekman |url=http://www.sofiaecho.com/2009/01/27/666229_google-search-results-link-bulgarian-government-with-failure-ruin-collapse |title=Sofia Echo coverage |publisher=Sofiaecho.com |date=February 25, 2009 |accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Spamdexing}}
Some website operators have adapted Google bombing techniques to do "spamdexing". This includes, among other techniques, posting of links to a site in an [[Internet forum]] along with phrases the promoter hopes to associate with the site (see [[spam in blogs]]). Unlike conventional message board spam, the object is not to attract readers to the site directly, but to increase the site's ranking under those search terms. Promoters using this technique frequently target forums with low reader traffic, in hopes that it will fly under the moderators' radar. [[Wiki]]s in particular are often the target of this kind of page rank vandalism, as all of the pages are freely editable. This practice was also called "money bombing" by [[John Hiler]] circa 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/01/26/BUG3M4GVDS1.DTL|title=Google targeted by pranksters: Web site operators, bloggers skew results|date=January 26, 2004|accessdate=November 27, 2007|author=Kopytoff, Verne|work=San Francisco Chronicle }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The 100 Best Trends 2006: Emerging Developments You Can't Afford to Ignore|author1=Ochoa, George |author2=Corey, Melinda|page=213|year=2005|accessdate=November 27, 2007|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=1-59337-451-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=am-c2MR1ZA0C&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another technique is for the owner of an Internet [[domain name]] to set up the domain's [[Domain Name System|DNS]] entry so that all [[subdomain]]s are directed to the same server. The operator then sets up the server so that page requests generate a page full of desired Google search terms, each linking to a subdomain of the same site, with the same title as the subdomain in the requested [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]. Frequently the subdomain matches the linked phrase, with spaces replaced by [[underscore]]s or [[hyphen]]s. Since Google treats subdomains as distinct sites, the effect of many subdomains linking to each other is a boost to the [[PageRank]] of those subdomains and of any other site they link to.

On February 2, 2007, many have noticed changes in the Google algorithm that largely affects, among other things, Google bombs: only roughly 10% of the Google bombs worked as of February 15, 2007. This is largely due to Google refactoring its valuation of PageRank.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A quick word about Googlebombs|url = http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2007/01/quick-word-about-googlebombs.html|website = Official Google Webmaster Central Blog|accessdate = 2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://answers.google.com/answers/main?cmd=threadview&amp;id=179922 |title=Google Answers: Google Inc., and the Google Bomb |publisher=Answers.google.com |accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quixtar's bomb====
[[Quixtar]], a [[multi-level marketing]] company, has been accused by its critics of using its large network of websites to move sites critical of Quixtar lower in search engine rankings. A Quixtar independent business owner (IBO) reports that a Quixtar leader advocated the practice in a meeting of Quixtar IBOs. Quixtar denies wrongdoing and states that its practices are in accordance with search engine rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ojr.org/ojr/stories/050601glaser/ |title=Companies subvert search results to squelch criticism |work=Online Journalism Review |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116120608/http://www.ojr.org/ojr/stories/050601glaser/ |archivedate=January 16, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====GoDaddy bomb====
{{see also|Protests against SOPA and PIPA}}
On December 26, 2011, a bomb was started against [[GoDaddy]] to remove them from the #1 place on Google for "[[domain registration]]" in retaliation for its support for [[SOPA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=14 |url=https://plus.google.com/115702843161763309837/posts/2QqAe6xP7Xk |title=Rob Kohr - Google+ - A better way to fight SOPA GoDaddy has been a supporter of… |publisher=Plus.google.com |accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was then disseminated through [[Hacker News]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3393177 |title=Attack GoDaddy - better than a boycott &amp;#124; Hacker News |publisher=News.ycombinator.com |accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other examples of Google bombs====
In Australia, one of the first examples of Google bombs was when the keyword "old rice and monkey nuts" was used to generate traffic for ''[[Herald Sun]]'' columnist [[Andrew Bolt]]'s website. The keyword phrase references the alleged $4 billion in loan deals brokered by [[Tirath Khemlani]] to Australia in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cannell|first1=David|title=Google Bomb Tricks To Avoid|url=http://sydneysearchresultsptyltd.com.au/local/seo-tricks-to-avoid|publisher=Sydney Search Results|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yuta.jpg|thumb|''Gyotaku'' print of a fish]]
'''''Gyotaku''''' (Japanese 魚拓, from gyo "fish" + taku "stone impression") is the traditional Japanese method of printing fish, a practice which dates back to the mid-1800s.  This form of [[nature printing]] was used by fishermen to record their catches, but has also become an art form of its own.

Gyotaku is a Japanese method of printmaking that traditionally utilizes fish, sea creatures or similar subjects as printing “plates” in its process. The literal translation of the word is “fish stone rubbing”.

Gyotaku, or Japanese fish printing, was originally used to record and  commemorate a fisherman’s catch. Prints were made using Sumi ink and Washi paper. It is rumored that Samurai would settle fishing competitions using Gyotaku prints. This original form of Gyotaku, as a recording method for fisherman, is still utilized today, and can be seen hanging in tackle shops in Japan and Okinawa. 

Eventually it evolved into an art form with three different approaches: 
*Chokusetsu-ho, or the direct style, is the most similar to the original methodology. The fish is cleaned, prepped, supported, and then inked. At this point, dampened Washi (“rice” paper ) is applied to the fish, and an image is created by careful hand rubbing or pressing.

*Kansetsu-ho, or indirect printing, is a more painstaking process, and yields very delicate and detailed images. This method involves adhering Washi Paper, silk, or other fabric to the fish using rice paste. The fish offers the detail of its relief through the silk, and the ink is applied painstakingly to the silk while adhered to the fish, with tampos (applicators made of silk wrapped around cotton).

*Tensha-ho, or transfer Gyotaku, is a lesser known and used technique.  It was developed when the objective of the printing was to create the image on a hard surface such as wood, leather, plastic or even the wall of a dwelling. These are situations when it would be impossible to apply the foundation of the work directly to the surface of the inked subject. In Tensha-ho, the subject is prepared and inked as in the direct method.  Then image is then lifted from the subject after placing and pressing a piece of nylon or polyethylene on the ink covered object. The transfer film is then lifted and carefully placed and pressed upon the target surface. In this method, the final image is not reversed as it is in the Direct method. Through the process, the image is reversed a second time, resulting in a right-oriented impression.

At times  direct prints are left in the black and white state they are printed in, with the eyes painted in afterwards, in gray-scale. This most closely approximates the original form of Gyotaku, the record of the fisherman's catch. Color is usually added to artistic version of these creations, either by using colored inks directly on the fish, or by adding color to the piece afterwards, with transparent washes of inks or color mediums. Finished works can be mounted on scrolls, wet mounted to canvas,  or mounted  to background washi paper, then matted and framed. Frequently, the work includes a red oriental seal, or “chop” and/or some Kanji calligraphy indicating the artist’s name and information, or important subject matter.

Similarly, nature prints evolved in the western world beginning as a functional process and later becoming an art form. In the earliest nature prints, inks or pigments were applied directly to the relief surface of leaves and/or other relatively flat natural subjects in order to capture images of their sizes, shapes, surface textures, and delicate vein or scale patterns. Typically both sides of a leaf were coated with ink and the leaf was then placed inside a folded sheet or between two sheets of paper. When rubbed by hand or run through a [[printing press]] a mirror image was produced of the topside and underside of the same leaf. Often the prints were done in black ink and the flowers later painted or drawn in by the artist. In other cases a flattened, dried leaf or plant was coated once with black ink and then repeatedly printed in a printing press. The initial dark print was used as a work copy or proof print. The subsequent prints, with fainter traces of ink, were hand colored to more closely resemble the appearance of the real subjects.  This methodology is generally applicable to making a print from a fish. They also used wood and carved images into that.

The direct method currently is used throughout the world to record images of a wide diversity of subjects. For example, most western fish printers utilize the direct method but apply colored inks to more closely duplicate the natural colors of their subjects. Unlike prints from plates or blocks in which identical, duplicate images can be created the direct method produces unique, one-of-a-kind prints, and can be editioned like other forms of relief printing.

As a form of art, ''Gyotaku'' is also practiced around the world.

'''Hit Song Science''' is a term coined by [[Mike McCready (music entrepreneur)|Mike McCready]] and trademarked by the company he co-founded, [[Polyphonic HMI]]. It concerns the possibility of predicting whether a song will be a hit, prior to its distribution using automated means such as [[machine learning]] software.

==Scientific background==
The scientific nature of Hit Song Science is a subject of debate in the [[music information retrieval]] (MIR) community. Early studies claimed that using [[machine learning]] techniques could capture some information from audio signals and lyrics that would explain&lt;ref&gt;Dhanaraj, R. and Logan, B. Automatic Prediction of Hit Songs, Proc. of Ismir 2005, London, UK&lt;/ref&gt; popularity. 
However, a larger-scale evaluation&lt;ref&gt;Pachet, F. and Roy, P. (2008) [http://www.csl.sony.fr/downloads/papers/2008/pachet-08c.pdf Hit Song Science is Not Yet a Science]. Proceedings of Ismir 2008, pages 355-360, Philadelphia, USA&lt;/ref&gt; contradicts the claims of “Hit Song Science”, i.e. that the popularity of a music title can be learned effectively from known audio features. 
Many other reasons, including the well known "cumulative advantage" or [[preferential attachment]] effects deeply contradicts&lt;ref&gt;Pachet, F. (2011) Hit Song Science. [http://www.csl.sony.fr/downloads/papers/2011/pachet-11a.pdf] In Tao, Tzanetakis &amp; Ogihara, editor,  Music Data Mining, CRC Press/Chapman Hall&lt;/ref&gt; the possibility of practical applications. 
Nevertheless, automatic prediction techniques are the basis of hit counseling businesses (HSS Technology). Recent work by Herremans et al. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herremans, D., Martens, D., &amp; Sörensen, K.|title=Dance hit song prediction|journal=Journal of New Music Research|date=2014|volume=43|issue=3|pages=291-302|doi=10.1080/09298215.2014.881888|url=http://dorienherremans.com/sites/default/files/wp_hit.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that audio features can indeed be used to outperform a random oracle when predicting top 10 versus top 30-40 hits &lt;ref&gt;[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bmvxvm/a-machine-successfully-predicted-the-hit-dance-songs-of-2015 Vice Magazine: A Machine Successfully Predicted the Hit Dance Songs of 2015] &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Commercial applications==
A technology proposing to exploit Hit Song Science was introduced in 2003 by an artificial intelligence company out of Barcelona, Spain, called [[Polyphonic HMI]]. Polyphonic HMI has since spun off a new Delaware C corporation, Music Intelligence Solutions, Inc., which used to run uPlaya, a site geared toward music professionals. In 2006 however one of the company's founders, [[Mike McCready (music entrepreneur)|Mike McCready]] left to pursue another direction in the digital music space.
The idea of Hit Song Science has generated response from many in the music industry, including [[Chuck D]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=51928 XXLmag.com: Chuck D and uPlaya Analyze Hit Songs]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Lamm]], [[Stratton Leopold]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/modules/news/tools.php?tool=print&amp;id=1189500 Stratton Leopold to Advisory Board]&lt;/ref&gt; Gregg Scholl of [[The Orchard (music label)|The Orchard]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2009/06/uplaya-cuts-multitiered-alliance-with-the-orchard.html Music Intelligence Solutions Partners with The Orchard]&lt;/ref&gt; and officials at The Sync Agency&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS55195+16-Jun-2008+MW20080616 Music Intelligence Solutions Partners with The Sync Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Blue Infinity Music. Prior to McCready's departure, Hit Song Science was profiled by [[NBC]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6jg70weJWs NBC Network News Feature on uPlaya]&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFuA0MqP8kA BBC News Report]&lt;/ref&gt; and various major news outlets. The plot line of an episode of "[[Numb3rs]]"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJL88mBif6U Episode of "Numb3rs" Inspired by Hit Song Science]&lt;/ref&gt; was inspired by the technology.
Music Intelligence Solutions, Inc., is using Hit Song Science as a basis for several contests done in partnership with organizations such as [[AllHipHop.com]], [[Urban Latino]] and ''American Songwriter'' magazine, and claims to have predicted the commercial success of [[Norah Jones]]'s debut album, ''[[Come Away with Me]]'', (which won a Grammy for Best Album) and Ben Novak's debut single, "[[Turn Your Car Around]]", which reached the number 12 spot in the UK Top 40 charts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uplaya.com/about_hss/hssquotes Ben Novak's debut single enters the UK Top 40 chart at number 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar technologies are now emerging with companies such as [[Mixcloud]], [http://www.musicxray.com MusicXray], and [http://bandmetrics.com/ BandMetrics] who are using their technologies. Mixcloud is working with Queen Mary Technologies.

'''Ixtlán del Rio''' is an archaeological site located in the [[Ixtlán del Rio]] municipality, on the south west region of the [[Nayarit]] State, Mexico. It is also known as "Los Toriles" and contains the only vestiges of the western cultures in Nayarit.&lt;ref name="INAH"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Arana Alvarez|first = Raúl M.|date =|title = Zona arqueologica Ixtlán del Río|url = http://www.inah.gob.mx/es/red-de-museos/266-zona-arqueologica-ixtlan-del-rio-o-los-toriles|format = Text based on work by Raúl Martín Arana Álvarez, Eduardo S. Contreras, José Corona Núñez &amp; Rodolfo Castro Hernández.|journal = INAH|language = Spanish|location = Mexico|trans-title=Ixtlán del Río Archaeological site|accessdate = March 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of prehispanic vestiges in the form of [[petroglyph]]s are registered in five areas, the most important are "El Terrero", "Sayulapa" and "El Veladero", which depict [[Sgraffito|sgraffiti]] lines and representations of abstract figures, such as spirals with rays.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Of the traditional Shaft Tombs, five large concentration areas are identified, containing human bone remains; domestic pottery [[ollas]], [[Comal (cookware)|comal]]es and cantaros (pitchers)]; as well as sculpture type remains (human and animal figures).&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

==Background==
In remote times in which early American settlers crossed the Behring Strait, several sedentary groups migrated south. The territory of present-day Nayarit State has manifestations of those settlers, chronologically and consecutively located in three cultural periods: Los Concheros, the shaft tomb tradition and the Aztatlán tradition.&lt;ref name=Encinay&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |date= |title=Historia Nayarit |trans-title=Nayarit History |journal=Enciclopedia de los municipios |location=Mexico |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_nayarit |language=Spanish |format= |accessdate=September 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517162123/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_nayarit |archivedate=2011-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Los Concheros===
Los concheros ("concha" = shell), is a name given to groups dedicated to the sea exploitation of the ocean shores, and in the process developed the first settlements, with sea shells. According to archaeologist Gabriela Zepeda, the Matanchén and San Blas coves, it was in the Nayarit shores where history commenced in these lands. From about 2000 BCE up to 1500 CE, an amazing occupation persisted by a culture that perceived the sea as merciful and stormy God. It was also the origin of artistic ceramic modeling and cooking.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

===Shaft Tomb Tradition===
[[File:Ancient Western Mexico Archaeological Sites.svg|350px|thumb|Western Mexico archaeological sites. The orange circles show archeological sites. The larger green circles highlight the most important sites. Note that the sites form what has been called the "shaft tomb arc" which extends from northwest Nayarit through the central Jalisco highlands and down to Colima.]] [[File:ShafttombMNAH.jpg|350px|thumb|Reconstruction of an excavated Shaft tomb exhibited at the [[Museo Nacional de Antropologia e Historia]], México.]]

On the traditional shaft tomb tradition, five major areas of concentration were identified, containing bones; ceramics for domestic use (pots, comales and pitchers); and remains of sculptural type (human and animal figures).&lt;ref name=Enciixt   /&gt;

The Shaft Tomb Tradition (500 BCE - 500 CE) constitutes a peculiar feature of mesoamerican prehispanic development in México, although there are analog burials forms elsewhere in the continent. Shaft Tombs thus far discovered in the Nayarit territory, were found and excavated outside of the settlement sites of that epoch, in vertical shafts (Wells), with one or two chambers where their dead were placed together with human and animal sculptures, also with large vessels that contained funerary offerings, these reflect the development achieved by this tradition, with the particular regional characteristics found.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

The '''[[Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition]]''' or '''shaft tomb culture''' refers to a set of interlocked cultural traits found in the western [[Mexican states]] of [[Jalisco]], [[Nayarit]], and, to a lesser extent, [[Colima]] to the south, roughly dating to the period between 300 [[Common Era|BCE]] and 400 [[Common Era|CE]], although there are disagreements on this end-date.  Nearly all of the artifacts associated with this shaft tomb tradition have been discovered by looters and are without [[provenance]], making dating problematic.&lt;ref&gt;The International Council of Museum estimates that 90% of the clay figurines come from illegal excavations [http://icom.museum/redlist/LatinAmerica/english/page04.htm ICOM].&lt;/ref&gt;  The first major undisturbed shaft tomb associated with the tradition was not discovered but until 1993, at Huitzilapa, Jalisco.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, [http://www.famsi.org/research/williams/wm_classicperiod.html Classic period page] as well as Danien, p. 23.  There is some evidence (Meighan &amp; Nicholson, p. 42) that many tombs were looted in ancient times.&lt;/ref&gt;

The shaft tomb tradition is thought to have developed around 300 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, [http://www.famsi.org/research/williams/wm_classicperiod.html Classic period page] and most other sources give the 300 BCE date.  For example, Dominique Michelet in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures'' says "it probably started earlier" than 200 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; Some shaft tombs predate the tradition by more than 1000 years, for example, the shaft tomb at [[El Opeño]] in [[Michoacán]] has been dated to 1500 BCE but it is linked to central, rather than western Mexico.  Like much else concerning the tradition, its origins are not well understood, although the valleys around [[Tequila, Jalisco]], which include the archaeological sites of Huitzilapa and [[Teuchitlan tradition|Teuchitlan]], constitute its "undisputed core".&lt;ref&gt;Beekman (2000) p. 388 &amp; 394.&lt;/ref&gt;  The tradition lasted until at least 300 CE although, as noted above, there is disagreement on the end date.&lt;ref&gt;The proposed end date of the shaft tomb tradition varies considerably.  Williams as well as the [[De Young Museum]] give a date of 300 CE.  The International Council of Museums, on the other hand, provides a date of 500 CE, while the Smithsonian and ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures'' give 600 CE.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aztatlán Tradition===
The archaeological ruins of "Los Toriles" are related to the Aztatlán tradition. Its buildings contain temples with stairs and worship places made of round stones jointed with clay, stone slabs and in some cases, with motif carved stones including spirals and a snake.&lt;ref name=Enciixt   /&gt;

The Aztatlán tradition is chronologically located on a period from 700 BCE throughout 1520 CE, it is considered a western mesoamerican cultural event that shares cultural traits with the [[Toltec]] and received cultural influences from central highlands.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

This rich tradition is manifested in their varied and beautiful complex ceramic and polished stone, [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]], and jade, such as: arrowheads; human instruments, gods and animals. Metal work impacted the agricultural activity and environmental exploitation, manufactured utilitarian artifacts as well as ornamental and sumptuary objects.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

Architecture reached its peak when ballgame courts appeared, their construction prompted the organizing of large well designed platforms, patios and squares with pyramids of certain elevations, walkways and paved roads, stairways, worship stone carvings, columns as roof support, roofs, posts, palm and grass, utilization of adobe walls and floors. The burial was common in large pots where skeletons lie in sitting or extended position, accompanied by offerings primarily made of pottery.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

The " Aztatlán Tradition " flourished in the south of the State with the cultural development of Ixtlán de Río, on a period from around 750 BCE to 1110 CE, recognized as the Mid-Ixtlán period. Its early phase corresponds to the period that goes from 300 BCE to 600 CE.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

From the "Aztatlán Tradition" the Shaft Tombs are highlighted, and it is noted that the discovery of [[Smoking pipe]]s vestiges in Amapa imply that tobacco was farmed, there are also samples that demonstrate the use of metals, form manufacturing needles and fish hooks, also bricks for construction evidence was found.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

In more recent times, within the "Aztatlán tradition", the now called Sentispac town, formerly known as Tzenticpac or Centicpac, was the seat of the lordship of the same name, which extended to Omitlán, Itzcuintla, Cillan and Atecomatlán and was occupied by Totorames native groups, who dominated and receiving tributes from Coras and Zayahuecos settled in the same coastal region.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

===Toponymy===
The word "'''Ixtlán'''" is of [[Nahuatl]] origin, composed by the words "Itz-ittztell" that means obsidian, and "Tlán", that means place with abundance, that is, "Place where obsidian is abundant".&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;&lt;ref name=Enciixt   &gt;{{cite journal |last= |first=   |date=  |title= Ixtlán del Río, Nayarit
|trans-title=|journal=  Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México|location=Mexico|url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/nayarit/mpios/18006a.htm |language=Spanish |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Mexican Municipalities Encyclopedia, Ixtlán, means place dedicated to Ehécatl, Wind God .&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

===History===
This important site was very possibly occupied from 300 BCE through 600 CE. During the first stage a cultural complex was developed known as the Shaft Tomb tradition in which offerings were placed inside of funeral chambers. Between 500 and 600 CE the Shaft Tomb tradition is abandoned and its development is registered within an ample cultural region known as Aztatlán, with an apogee towards 750 and 1,100 CE.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

With the "Tradición Aztatlán" develops a new way of life and it begins towards 750 – 900 CE. This cultural development is identified as mid-Ixtlán period (750 - 1110) that represents the apogee of the city, dedicated to Ehécatl (Wind God); and late Ixtlán (1110–1525CE) identified by red smooth ceramic for domestic use as well as cajetes and tripod [[molcajetes]]s decorated with white designs over red.&lt;ref name=Busca   /&gt;

The city was founded in the 12th century, by [[Nahuatlaca]] tribes en route towards the Valley of Mexico, forming the Ahuacatlán Lordship, known by its building construction and trading of obsidian goods.&lt;ref name=Enciixt   /&gt;

It is then that the urban settlement grows considerable with the construction of large terraces, palaces, temples and altars, acquiring a certain regional importance as manufacturing and commercial trade center. Although more than 85 mounds and structures have been located in the site, that remain still unexplored, at the moment it is only possible to visit fifteen structures, among them the building called Quetzalcoatl Temple that displays a circular shape with a parapet surrounding it and with peculiar perforations in cross shape.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The temple has two altars on top of the Mexico Central Plateau style. Other important buildings are structures called "Reliefs Palace", "Columns Palace", the "Four Column Palace" complex and the "Square Palace".&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Ixtlán is the most studied archaeological zone in Nayarit. Its influence zone extended to the present day municipalities of Ixtlán del Rio, Ahuacatlán, Jala and Santa Maria del Oro. Their main towns were Cacalután, Tepuzhuacán, Mexpan, Zoatlán, Xala, Jomulco, Tequepexpan, Camotlán, Tetitlán, Acuitapilco and Zapotán.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Petroglyphs===
In Santiago Ixcuintla, [[INAH]] has registered the existence of petroglyphs from the "Los Concheros" epoch, in the Las Parejas, Emérita, Yago, El Caballo and Acatán de las Piñas sites, with a total of 13 engravings, including the "Piedra Galana".&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

The presence of prehispanic vestiges in the form of [[Petroglyph]]s are registered in five areas, the most important are "El Terrero", "Sayulapa" and "El Veladero", which depict [[Sgraffito|sgraffiti]] lines and representations of abstract figures, such as spirals with rays.&lt;ref name=Enciixt   /&gt;

===Ceramic===
This stage of prehispanic development distinguishes and identifies western Mexico from other mesoamerican cultural expressions, during the late formative period and early classical. The Nayarit shaft tomb complexes are identified within the early Ixtlán period (300 BCE to 300 CE), and three distinctive clay modeling styles have been defined: Chimisco, Ixtlán and San Sebastian.&lt;ref name=Busca   /&gt;

The pottery of this tradition shows abundance of colors, predominating red, orange, yellow beige and the "negative" form. Common themes are human beings as warriors, musicians, women, sick people and couples.&lt;ref name=Busca   /&gt;

==The Site==
The '''Ixtlán del Río''' site is known as "Los Toriles", it was a constantly growing city and its inhabitants place huge importance to its buildings. They had urbanism knowledge, applied to an organized arrangement, with stairs, restricted accesses, open spaces, altars, sidewalks, drains, causeways, neighborhoods and palaces throughout the extensive city that flourished from 700 to 1200 CE.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

It had its heyday as a city during the "Aztatlán Tradition" period, in an area extended over eighty hectares. In the late phase, that corresponds to the period from 1110 to 1525 CE, had artistic red smooth ceramic expressions for home use, vessels and [[molcajete]]s tripods with white decor on red. This same period developed the metallurgy used to produce ornamental, ritual objects and obsidian bifacial instruments. On slopes they built extensive terraces, palaces, worship spaces, people’s homes, farmland areas and obsidian carving workshops.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

It is clear that it is still unknown what was their original culture, it is only known that they were predecessors of the [[Cora people|Coras]] and [[Huichol people|Huichol]] or Wixáritari peoples, they believed in life after death.&lt;ref name=Pedro   &gt;{{cite journal |last= |first=   Pedro |date=Oct 24, 2006  |title= Los Toriles, Noticias de Historia Antigua y Arqueología|trans-title=Los Toriles, ancient history and archaeology news |journal= El Informador |location=  |url= http://historiayarqueologia.wordpress.com/2006/10/24/abriran-exposicion-sobre-culturas-prehispanicas-en-nayarit/ |language=Spanish |format= |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Accordingly, what their name was is not known, these were communities a little older than 2,200 years, and are known as belonging to the Shaft Tomb Tradition, constructed in vertical wells, round or square, representing the maternal uterus.&lt;ref name=Pedro   /&gt;

Anthropologist Marina Anguiano concludes that at the Spaniards arrival to these lands, ethnic-linguistic groups existed of the Yuto-Aztec or Yuto-Nahuatl family, which had a socio-political structure divided into lordships, ruled by groups, possibly of noble rank, and a number of local lords.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

This archaeological site is considered related to the Aztatlán tradition, of which Corinca&lt;ref&gt;Corinca (1502-1530) was the last Lord of Aztatlán. He took office in 1513. During his Government, the tahue and achier peoples became tributaries of Aztatlán. In 1517, Aztatlán became part of the Chimalhuacana Confederation.&lt;/ref&gt; was the last governor. Its constructions contain temples with stairways and altars made from round stones jointed with clay, slab stones and, in some cases, with carved stones with spirals and a serpent.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The site was founded, in the 12th century, by Nahuatlacas tribes while on their way to the Valley of Mexico, and formed part of the Ahuacatlán kingdom, known by its constructions and obsidian objects which they traded.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The site has an unusual pyramid for Mesoamerica; it is a round construction 24 meters diameter by four meters high. It has five stairways harmonically distributed around its perimeter. A wall that ends on top has small cruciform windows. Probably this was a ceremonial center dedicated to [[Quetzalcoatl]], central image of the [[Toltec]] culture. The shaft tombs are the most representative funeral constructions of the area, although there are other modalities such as "shaft tombs" or earth graves where dead people were barely buried near the surface. Ceramics are constituted by spherical glasses with vertical walls tall neck and triple bell support. The most frequent ornamental motifs are flowers and streamlined butterflies, deer and tiger heads. There are many ceramic vessels decorated with white over red color rhombuses and segments.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Due to its special characteristics, ceramics and sculptures from this region are known as "Ixtlán style".&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The small 30 to 40 centimeters high sculptures distinguish themselves by ornaments consisting of earrings and nose perforations, where they placed one or more hoops.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

From the rich Ixtlán ceramics, scale models with excellent finishing are featured, from them we can intuit their forms of life, the social organization and the economic life characteristic of these towns. There are scale models that represent houses, groups in some activity and ballgame courts. These are always constructions with life and movement. Also, worth mentioning, are sculptures representing soldiers, identifiable from a spiked helmet; the chest is armor protected and in their hands a cane resembling a mallet. The lower part generally is naked.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

[[File:Ixtlán.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ixtlán del Río another view of the Round Structure]]

==Structures==
Ixtlán del Río archaeological site has a plaza, with an altar with four small stairways and to the sides buildings that appear to be small rectangular rooms.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;&lt;ref name=Busca &gt;{{cite web |first=  |last=  |title=Zona Arqueologica los Toriles |url=  http://www.buscanay.com/Ixtlan%20del%20Rio/Atractivos%20Turisticos/Los%20toriles.html |publisher=Buscanay |location=Mexico |language= Spanish |trans-title=Los Toriles Archaeological Site  |year= |accessdate= September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These temples/rooms are built on platforms with adobe pilasters, as well as sidewalks and stairways.&lt;ref name=Busca   /&gt;

One of these temples has a road paved with stone slabs, which leads to the round monument, discovered in 1948 by Prof. José Corona Núñez and eloquently describes his discovery, stating: "the round monument has 30 meters in diameter by 4 meters high;" sloped walls crowned by a perforated parapet with crosses, as if skylights, four access stairs, limited by alfardas die finished, some of them still have cross shaped handrails.&lt;ref name=Busca   /&gt;

Above, within the round patio, limiting the parapets are pyramid bases, one to the north and another at the south, with stairs geared toward the center. The North has a smooth vertical panel and the south has a beveled cornice. According to the remains found, these bases maintained small altars with column portals, ceilings and stone altered battlements: one shaped as arrowheads, others composed of a disk with two circles engraved, this monument is called "Quetzalcoatl Temple" and is believed to belong to the Toltec horizon by the Toltec cultural traits observed in its architecture.&lt;ref name=Busca   /&gt;

In earlier times, between 300 BCE and 600 CE., flourished a cultural complex known as shaft tombs tradition characterized by underground architecture and offerings deposited inside the funeral chambers. Its origins are ancient and have been found in the neighboring States of Colima, Zacatecas, Jalisco and Michoacán.&lt;ref name=Busca   /&gt;

Around 500 to 600 CE.,the shaft  tomb traditoion disappears and a new way of perceiving life starts from 750 to 900 CE. This cultural development is identified as the Aztatlán tradition and is known in the mid-Ixtlán period (750 to 1110) which represents the apogee of this city dedicated to the God of the wind; and late Ixtlán (1110 to 1525) identified by red smooth ceramics household items and cajetes and tripod molcajetes with white decor on Red.&lt;ref name=Busca   /&gt;

One of the temples has a stone slab paved road, which leads to the round building of section A.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Section A===
Corresponds to the initial explorations of the site, composed of four structures; two of which are restored with rectangular shape with columns to the front, that limit spaces between the rooms, these two structures are part of the plaza with pyramidal foundation with central altar and other unexplored structures (mounds to the north and east of the plaza). The highlight of this complex is the circular pyramid, discovered in 1948 by [[Jose Corona Nuñez|Prof. Jose Corona Nuñez]], it is the most important structure of the archaeological site that, from its design and finishing, constitutes one of the most beautiful works of the prehispanic architecture in western Mexico. "The monument is of round base 24 meters in diameter and 4 meters high, originally was a cylinder with vertical walls (compact drum) crowned with a perforated parapet with small cruciform windows that give the construction the aspect of a large brazier, with five stairs harmonically distributed in its contour"; in the superior part there are two rectangular altars, and it is known as a Quetzalcoatl or Ehécatl temple,&lt;ref&gt;Quetzalcoatl temples probably dedicated to Ehécatl, are mesoamerican round buildings, generally related to Ehécatl. The circle is a perfect geometric figure, has no beginning or end, therefore infinite, as the gods.&lt;/ref&gt; due to its architectonic characteristics and elements.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Section B===
It is composed by two plazas bordered by structures that correspond to buildings foundations and small pyramidal shape altars. Both plazas have nine monuments each, rectangular form, explored and restored; in center is a small foundation, similar to the ceremonial altar; dimensions and height varies and is in relation to the site topography and the plaza needs. The buildings stairways face the plaza, which has three closed spaces with one in front open and roof supporting pillars. Also there are remains of dirt floors, evidence of prehispanic occupation; constructive systems base in retaining walls with relief carved stone walls, with symbols religious and animal motifs.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Section C===
It is the entrance to the archaeological zone; the south part has three explored and recovered structures that form part of a larger complex of plaza and buildings with a central altar. From the explored constructions one is outstanding, with two rectangular bodies and a single story whose stairways face towards the plaza. Also there are large columns that were used for support the roof of two large halls; the one to the east has a room and stairway integrated to the wall behind the structure.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Central Altar and Plaza C===
Is a two bodied pyramidal shape structure with stairways in all four sides; an "alfarda", ended on a dice shaped element in the top. Two bodied Pyramidal foundation. Is located in the center of Plaza C; its stairway faces west and is limited by two unexplored mounds, that are part of the plaza. The structure, just as other monuments, has stone retaining walls that were stucco covered.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

==Shaft Tombs==
During prehispanic times, western cultures buried to their dead in shaft tombs, these are vertical wells 1.5 to 16 meters deep, where diverse sculptures were placed as offering for the deceased; these were of various types of polychrome ceramic figures; animal forms, anthropomorphous and small and medium size scale models, which measured from five to 80 centimeters.&lt;ref name=Elda   &gt;{{cite web |first=Elda   |last= Lastra |title=Esculturas de las tumbas de tiro en Ixtlán del Río |url=http://www.inah.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=226:esculturas-de-las-tumbas-de-tiro-en-ixtlan-del-rio-&amp;catid=45:especiales&amp;Itemid=118 |publisher=INAH |location=Mexico |language= Spanish|trans-title=Shaft Tombs Sculptures of Ixtlán del Río |date=November 18, 2009 |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ceramic figures date back to the late Preclassical period (400 BCE to 200 CE) and to the Classical period (200 to 650 CE), these were discovered by archaeologists since 1945 until recent years in areas included in the Nayarit, Colima and Jalisco States, where this funeral activity was practiced.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

In the case of the Ixtlán del Rio Archaeological Zone, the figures represent funeral processions, villages, people lying down or in beds, the flier and ballgame rituals, were modeled in reddish clay and decoration painted with black, red, orange, yellow and beige colors.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

According to art historian Lizeth Barreto Saucedo, these sculptures were modeled with reddish clay, dried and cooked in open fire.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

The funeral processions scale models are square or round, the carved figures depict many people; musicians, moving towards a house, while carrying the dead person for burial; they carry food plates and practice the cheek perforation ritual practice.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

The pieces representing the flier ritual, represents an individual dressed as a bird, on top of a pole on a flying simulation pose, can be leaning face down on the post or standing up looking upwards, houses are seen below and many people watching the ritual, some dance or play.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

Similarly, there are ball game sculptures, similar to the Mesoamerican "I" shaped structure, the difference here is that there are houses in the ends of the representation, and some spectators.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

The dancers and musicians figures not only appear in the processions scale models, there are also exclusive pieces of people groups in circular dances or playing instruments, such as drums, snails and flutes.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

The largest sculptures (20 to 80 centimeters) are anthropomorphous figures decorated with facial painting and different types from clothes, some are standing up and other are seated. Women carry vessels or children, and men carry balls or instruments, some are soldiers with shields. Figures of both genders carry jewels, earflaps and cut shell collars. The facial painting is naturalist and streamlined.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

Also sculptures with human figures representations are known with cheek perforations, in which three to four people are displayed (men and women) interconnected by an instrument that crosses their cheeks.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

The individuals lying down or in beds are similar to those from Veracruz, emphasizing that are figures tied to a bed, which would seem to indicate that are women dead from childbirth or convalescent.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

Five types of scale models have been classified, representing houses, measuring approximately 18 centimeters high by 20 wide and are distinguished by its shed roof with the corners raised in triangles form.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

The type 1 house lacks walls, only shows the roof and people inside. House type 2 has an ample room with walls. Type 3, the building half walls are leaned. Type 4, has two levels, with a room on each level and stairs. And type 5 is similar to Type 4, except that the house is full of people.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;
 
Among the scale models, there are also villages with a circular construction in the center, very similar to the pyramid of the [[Guachimontones]] Archaeological site in Jalisco, surrounded by houses as previously mentioned.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

Shaft tombs are vertical wells, whose surface can be circular or square, and have a depth of between 1.5 and 16 meters, and a width of between 0.80 and one meter; there are two types: familiar burials underneath the rooms, or cemeteries.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

'''Johann Lucas Kracker''', also '''Jan Lukáš Kracker''' or '''János Lukács Kracker''' (3 March 1717, [[Vienna]] - 1 December 1779, [[Eger]]) was an Austrian-Czech painter of the late [[Baroque art|Baroque]] period. His work consisted mostly of ceiling or wall [[fresco]]es and altarpieces.

== Life ==
His family originally came from [[Bohemia]] and his father, Josef Kracker (1683–1733), was a sculptor. He received his first training with Anton Hertzog (1692–1740) and continued at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna]] after 1738, where his teachers included [[Paul Troger]] and [[Michelangelo Unterberger]].&lt;ref name="N"&gt;{{NDB|12|632|632|Kracker, Johann Lucas|Klára Garas|122638417}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first frescoes, created for the Schlosskirche St. Martin ([[Graz]]) in 1742, have not survived.

Initially, he was employed at a workshop in [[Brno]], later becoming independent and working throughout [[Moravia]], briefly settling in [[Znojmo]], where he got married. He then moved on to [[Upper Hungary]] in 1754, where he worked in [[Šaštín-Stráže|Šaštín]] and [[Prešov]] (both now in [[Slovakia]]).&lt;ref name="N" /&gt; From 1760 to 1761, he was in Prague where, despite objections from the Prague Painters' Guild, he executed frescoes at the Church of St. Nikolaus in [[Malá Strana]]. From 1762 to 1764, he painted at the Monastery and the [[Premonstratensians|Premonstratensian]] Church in [[Jasov]].&lt;ref name="N" /&gt;

In 1767, he settled in Eger. Bishop {{ill|Karl von Esterhazy|hu|Eszterházy Károly}} commissioned him to do work for the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Eger|Diocese of Eger]] and at the Bishop's properties. Three years later, he created the altarpiece for the "Minoritenkirche" ([[Franciscan|Franciscan Church]]) and in 1777 he produced his masterpiece depicting the [[Council of Trent]] at the Líceum.&lt;ref name="N" /&gt; He remained in the Bishop's service for the rest of his life, although he occasionally travelled to execute small commissions elsewhere.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7902">'''Joy Postle''' was a pioneering American environmental artist and creator of celebrated murals depicting [[Florida]] wildlife.

==Early years and education==

Katherine Joy Postle was born on January 20, 1896 in [[Chicago]] to architect Oliver Hambleton Postle (1851-1900)&lt;ref&gt;The Chicago Daily News Almanac and Political Register for 1900, p. 408&lt;/ref&gt; and Mary M. Brown.&lt;ref name="American West 1998, page 252"&gt;''An Encyclopedia of Women Artists of the American West'', By Phil Kovinick and Marian Yoshiki-Kovinick, Published by University of Texas Press, 1998, page 252.&lt;/ref&gt; She was raised in an atmosphere of respect for aesthetic achievement.  Postle's father was well known in Chicago architectural circles, having served as treasurer of the Chicago Artists Business Association in 1900.  In partnership with David E. Postle (1853-?) his professional offices were in the [[Marquette Building (Chicago)]] and they advertised in the ''[[House Beautiful]]'' magazine — a magazine begun by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s friends and clients Chanucey Williams and William Herman Winslow's Auvergne Press.  Among other works, the Postle firm created the neo-classical Pattington Apartments of 1903.,&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Architecture, By Charles Waldheim, Katerina Rüedi, Katerina Rüedi Ray, page 374&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the-pattington.com/&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Prairie Style]] David E Postle House in [[Elgin, Illinois]],&lt;ref&gt;Prairie Style Architecture in Elgin and Edwardsville, http://www.mcnees.org/architecture/flw_architecture_elgin.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the Masonic Temple in Elgin, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;''Stone; an Illustrated Magazine'', 1902, page 483&lt;/ref&gt;  Joy earned a scholarship to attend the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] where she studied music and art. After graduation, Postle went west to rural [[Idaho]] and became certified to teach music and art.&lt;ref&gt;"Joy Postle, Florida Nature Artist", an on-line biography from the Joy Postle Collection at the University of Florida&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in Idaho==

Postle and her brother Vernon bought a ranch in southern Idaho along the [[Snake River]] Canyon.&lt;ref name="American West 1998, page 252"/&gt;  Postle often saddled her horse and rode into the hills or desert to sketch during the 1920s while she lived on the ranch.&lt;ref&gt;''Idaho Women in History'', by Betty Penson-Ward, page 150
&lt;/ref&gt;  Postle opened an art studio in [[Boise, Idaho]] and was receiving attention as an [[interior decorator]] and artist.  A journalist named Robert Blackstone came to interview her. They were married a year later on Dec. 6, 1928, and he became her manager.

==Travels in nature==

Following their marriage, the couple travelled through the western United States in a home-made "flivver bungalow", a trailer that they dubbed the "Brownie House".  They explored the country; Postle honed her art, accepted commissions and drew inspiration from the American landscape for her future work.&lt;ref name="A Rare Bird 2009"&gt;"A Rare Bird: The Art and Life of Joy Postle", by Denise Hall; in ''Reflections'', a journal of the Orange County Regional History Center, Spring 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronicler of the Florida environment==

They arrived in Florida in 1934 and continued their nomadic life, camping, hiking and [[bird watching]]; these explorations gave Postle the opportunity of closely studying nature and refining her craft. In 1937, Postle was involved in the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] Art Project. Three years later, Blackstone conceived the idea for their "Glamour Birds" act in which bird song, recorded by Blackstone, and music accompanied Postle as she painted birds and educated her audience.  Postle and Blackstone eventually settled in a modest home and studio on Lake Rose at [[Orlo Vista, Florida|Orlo Vista]] near [[Gotha, Florida]] in 1942.

Postle counted many creative people in her circle of friends including the Chicago / Florida [[Prairie Style]] architect [[Hermann V. von Holst]] whose portrait she drew.  "Joy told me once that she had performed for [[Carl Sandburg]]," her step-grandson Daren Kelly remembers. After her show, the famous poet approached her, took her hand in his huge one, and said, "I can see you’re a seeker. I'm a seeker too!"&lt;ref&gt;"Joy Postle" Florida Nature Artist", an on-line biography from the Joy Postle Collection at the University of Florida&lt;/ref&gt;

Postle used Florida’s environment as the chief subject for art.  She waded through swamps, climbed trees,endured bugs and stayed up all night" to observe her beloved birds and other wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;Postle, Joy, ''Orlando Sentinel'' obituary, June 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  Postle maintained that "a painting must have movement. It's a dance performed with a brush and pigment on a stage of canvas. It should be spontaneous and joyous".&lt;ref name="A Rare Bird 2009"/&gt;

Postle was an effective and inspirational art teacher.  As one student has said: "Joy Postle taught me to observe and draw from real life and then to escape into my own art and add design and a lot of me."&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Myers Kirton, interviewed on www.gallerydir.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murals==

Postle is best remembered for the [[murals]] that she created in commercial buildings and homes, adorning walls in [[Texas]], [[North Carolina]] and Florida.  In [[Beaumont, Texas]], Postle created murals evoking Texas and Beaumont history in a hotel lobby.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sanjacinto-museum.org/Herzstein_Library/Manuscripts/Finding_Aids/Aston/&lt;/ref&gt; In North Carolina, she created four walls of murals for the Canton Area Historical Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inst.ncecho.org/PhotoDetail.aspx?siteno%3D00508%26photono%3D046 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306160058/http://www.inst.ncecho.org/PhotoDetail.aspx?siteno=00508&amp;photono=046 |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Florida, her murals graced the First National Bank of [[Stuart, Florida|Stuart]], the Fort Gatlin Hotel in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], the San Carlos Hotel in Pensacola (1931, demolished 1993) and Casa Iberia at [[Rollins College]] in [[Winter Park, Florida|Winter Park]],&lt;ref name="A Rare Bird 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aspdev2.rollins.edu/OlinLibrary/arch/casa_iberia.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703080936/http://aspdev2.rollins.edu/OlinLibrary/arch/casa_iberia.htm |archivedate=2007-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as many private residences, including "[[Rowallan]]" in [[Ormond Beach, Florida|Ormond Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;"Joy at the Beach" by Joy Postle researcher Rick Kilby, from his blog "Visual Ephemera", March 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  At the age of eighty, Postle completed a mural at Orlando's Fashion Square Mall.&lt;ref&gt;America's Auction Network&lt;/ref&gt;  Surviving murals by Postle continue to be identified and recorded in Central Florida.

==Later years==

A fire at their home in 1968 killed Blackstone and badly injured Postle.  After years of extensive surgery, she resumed her performances and exhibitions. She continued taking commissions for pet portraits, exhibiting her work, and selling paintings well into old age. In 1984, Postle broke her hip and moved into West Orange Manor Nursing Home; nevertheless she continued painting. Joy Postle died on June 1, 1989 and her ashes were spread at her home at Lake Rose in Florida.&lt;ref name="A Rare Bird 2009"/&gt;

==Publications by Joy Postle==

Postle published several books, including: 
* ''Fine Feathers'' - 1941
* ''Glamour Birds of the Americas: Drawings and Poems'' - 1944
* ''Drawing Animals'' - 1953
* ''Drawing Birds'' - 1963

The '''Museum of Russian Icons''' is a non-profit art museum located in [[Clinton, Massachusetts]], in the United States. The collection includes more than 1,000 [[Russian icons]] and related artifacts, making it one of the largest private collections of Russian icons outside of Russia and the largest in North America. The icons in the collection range in date from the 15th century through to the present and covers almost the entire range of Russian icon images, symbols, and forms. 

== History ==
[[Image:CVanderwarkerGT7X7942.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Interior of the Museum]]

The Museum opened in October 2006. It began as the private collection of Gordon B. Lankton, a plastics engineer and former chairman and CEO of Nypro, Inc., a precision injection molding company now owned by [[Jabil Circuit]]. Lankton has been an avid traveler since he was stationed in Germany when he was in the Army. As outlined in his book ''The Long Way Home'', Lankton took a motorcycle trip around the world in 1956 and 1957, visiting (in chronological order), Germany, Austria, Italy, Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, India, Ceylon, Nepal, Burma, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Hong Kong, and Japan. According to Lankton, he had wanted to visit Russia but was not allowed to do so during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Museum of Russian Icons audio tour narration, accessed 1/2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Lankton first traveled to Russia to open a Nypro factory there. On that visit, he learned about iconographer Alyona Knyazeva and her icon school. After meeting Knyazeva and learning more about icons, Lankton began his collection, starting with a small, poor quality icon he found at a flea market in the [[Izmaylovo District]] of Moscow.

Over the following 30 years, Lankton amassed several hundred icons. He displayed them at his home, at Nypro in a small gallery, and occasionally on loan to other museums, including the [[Higgins Armory Museum]]. As the collection grew and response to the informal sharing of his collection proved positive, Lankton decided to open his own museum directly across the street from Nypro. The Museum was incorporated in 2004, and Lankton purchased the building in early 2006. It opened to the public on October 15, 2006. Since then, two major expansion projects have taken place: in 2008, a research library and the South Gallery were added. In 2010, Lankton purchased the building immediately next door to the Museum and undertook a construction project to seamlessly join the two structures. The first phase of this project included the West Gallery and an expanded Museum Shop; the second phase included an expanded lower level with the Tea Room and auditorium.

== Building ==
Both buildings that now make up the single museum property were originally associated with the [[Bigelow Carpet Mill]]. The second building, previously 195 Union Street, also served at one time as both the Clinton District Court and the Police Station. Both buildings were completely renovated on the interiors by David Durrant of Durrant Designs. Some historical details were retained and renovated, including the jail cells that were once part of the police station; and the period window frames in the West Gallery. The building now has more than 16,000 square feet of gallery space on three floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumofrussianicons.org/about-us.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606215524/http://www.museumofrussianicons.org/about-us.html |archivedate=2009-06-06 |df= }} Museum of Russian Icons: About Us.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collection ===

The Museum collection includes more than 1,000 Russian icons and related artifacts. The icons range in date from 1450 to the present day and are installed in thematic groupings rather than chronological order. The Museum is particularly proud to display extremely rare Royal Doors that once led to the High Altar of an Orthodox Church in Russia and can be traced back to the 17th century. The Royal Doors have recently been added to the Museum's collection and are considered to be the "finest pair in the United States."&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://museumofrussianicons.org/en/special-exhibits/on-view/royal-doors/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808045749/http://museumofrussianicons.org/en/special-exhibits/on-view/royal-doors/ |archivedate=2014-08-08 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exhibitions ===

The Museum organizes its own exhibitions from the permanent collection and also hosts visiting exhibitions from other museums and collections. In 2008 and 2010, respectively the Museum co-organized exhibitions of icons from the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] and the Andrei Rublev Museum of Early Russian Art and Culture. Because of an embargo of art loans from Russia to the U.S., ongoing since 2011, the Museum has relied on exhibitions originating in the United States. 

== Center for Icon Studies ==

The Museum houses the  [http://museumofrussianicons.org/research/index.php/publications/publication-guidelines/about-the-journal-of-icon-studies/] Center for Icon Studies, the research arm of the institution that publishes the online ''Journal of Icon Studies''. The journal is the only peer-reviewed publication exclusively devoted to Russian icons and related scholarship. Submissions to the journal are reviewed by members of the editorial board, which consists of eleven leading scholars in the field from the U.S., Europe, and Russia. The editorial board is composed of some of the leading researchers in the field of icon studies:
*Professor David Birnbaum, chairman of the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]
*Professor [[Robin Cormack]], professor emeritus of art history at the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]]
*Professor Michael Flier, Oleksandr Potebnja Professor of Ukrainian Philology in the Slavic Department and Director of the [[Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute]] at [[Harvard University]]

The '''Museumsquartier''' ('''MQ''') is a 60,000 m² large area in the [[Neubau|7th district]] of the city of [[Vienna]], [[Austria]];

== Highlights ==
The Museumsquartier contains [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] buildings as well as [[Modern architecture]] by the [[architect]]s Laurids and Manfred Ortner (Ortner &amp; Ortner Baukunst). The renovation of the former court stables began in April 1998. Three years later, the Museumsquartier opened in two stages (June and September 2001). The total cost of the construction was 150 Million Euro (two billion [[Austrian schilling|Austria Schilling]]).

The MQ is home to a range of installations from large [[art museum]]s like the [[Leopold Museum]] and the [[MUMOK]] (Museum of Modern Art Ludwig Foundation Vienna) to contemporary exhibition spaces like the [[Kunsthalle Wien]] and festivals like the [[Wiener Festwochen]], an annual summer event that is headquartered in the MuseumsQuartier Wien.

Since 2002, an [[artist-in-residence]] programme brought over 735 artists to MuseumsQuartier, who have been working and living in the studio spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.q21.at/en/artists-in-residence/artists/|title=Artists|website=www.q21.at|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The residency programme is run together with ''tranzit.org / ERSTE Stiftung,'' the [[Federal Ministry for Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs]] and the [[Research Institute for Arts and Technology]]''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.q21.at/en/artists-in-residence/about/|title=General Information of the Artist-In-Residence Programme|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Museumsquartier (Vienna U-Bahn)|Museumsquartier station]] of line U2 of the [[Vienna U-Bahn]], as well as the metro station "Volkstheater" is located next to the premises.

== Controversy ==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2018}}
There was negative [[Mass media|media]] reaction after it became known that the expensive public buildings had serious shortcomings regarding [[barrier-free]] [[wheelchair]] [[accessibility]]. Not even the recently constructed buildings (Kunsthalle, MUMOK and Leopold Museum) were able to fulfill the most basic requirements. After many negative reports across the media, and the commitment of [[Disability|handicapped]] interest groups, the majority of the problems were repaired in the following years.

[[Public Netbase]], an internet provider and sponsor of electronic art and culture programs, was not invited to be part of Museumsquartier in 2002. Originally located in a part of the MQ, it had to leave during the renovations, but after the construction was completed, it was not able to return to its former premises.

[[File:Rael Artel and Joanna Rajkowska's installation.jpg|thumb|Curator Rael Artel talking in front of the installation "Greeting from the Jerusalem Avenue" by Polish artist Joanna Rajkowska]]
'''''My Poland. On Recalling and Forgetting''''' is the first [[Holocaust]]-themed art exhibition in Estonia, taking place at [[Tartu Art Museum]] in early 2015,&lt;ref name="muuseum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="esimene"&gt;[http://www.muurileht.ee/eesti-esimene-holokaustiteemaline-kunstinaitus/ "SEL LAUPÄEVAL AVATAKSE EESTI ESIMENE HOLOKAUSTITEEMALINE KUNSTINÄITUS"] Müürileht, 3 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; seventy years after the end of World War II and the liberation of the [[Nazi extermination camp]]s.{{r|kataloog}} The exhibition, curated by museum's director [[Rael Artel]], received a lot of attention from Estonian society and from both Estonian and international media. It brough out the differences of opinion and initiated a public debate about the reflection of Holocaust and [[freedom of speech]], [[censorship]] and [[self-censorship]] in art. Originally, eight contemporary artworks were exhibited, one of them by an Estonian artist and seven from Polish artists (incl. one Polish–Israeli and one American with Polish Jewish roots). Soon after the opening of the exhibition the museum limited access to two works of art because of public criticism. Later, both of them were removed from the exhibition.&lt;ref name="muuseum" /&gt;

The name of the exhibition ''My Poland'' emphasizes curators personal perspective to [[Polish art|Polish contemporary art]] where Holocaust and the [[Second World War]] is a distinctive theme. The name refers to a popular Estonian books series ("My Estonia", "My Mexico", "My St. Petersburg", etc.) which also focuses on authors' personal impressions of different countries.

The works selected for the exhibition in Tartu Art Museum are made by well-known Polish artists most of whom have participated in the [[Venice Biennale]].&lt;ref name="muuseum"&gt;[http://tartmus.ee/files/wordpress/?page_id=47 ''My Poland''] on the homepage of Tartu Art Museum&lt;/ref&gt; Curator Rael Artel has said that although she tried to find comparable works from Estonian art, the only Holocaust themed work was John Smith's painting ''Holocaust''.&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt;

The exhibition is accompanied by a publication put together by Rael Artel and designed by Mikk Heinsoo. The exhibition was supported by [[The Cultural Endowment of Estonia]] and [[Estonian Ministry of Culture]]. ''My Poland'' is curated by the director of Tartu Art Museum Rael Artel and exhibition's coordinator is Julia Polujanenkova, museums' keeper of the contemporary art.&lt;ref name="muuseum" /&gt;

==Removal of videos from the exhibition==
''My Poland'' was opened on Saturday, 7 February.&lt;ref name="muuseum" /&gt; On Tuesday, Tartu Art Museum announced that access to two most criticized videos was being limited. Visitors could only see those videos by stating a direct request and after being introduced to curator's written explanation. Museum's director Artel made a full apology to everyone the display offended.&lt;ref name="vabandust"&gt;[http://tartu.postimees.ee/3086437/tartu-kunstimuuseumi-direktor-palume-vabandust-koigilt-keda-valjapanek-on-riivanud "Tartu kunstimuuseumi direktor: palume vabandust kõigilt, keda väljapanek on riivanud"] Postimees, 10 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Estonian Ministry of Culture held a discussion which was attended by Minister of Culture [[Urve Tiidus]] and the representatives of [[Jews in Estonia|Jewish community in Estonia]]. After the discussion Tiidus called the videos offending and Tartu Art Museum removed them from the exhibition entirely.&lt;ref name="arutelul"&gt;[http://www.postimees.ee/3088427/ministeeriumis-toimunud-arutelul-leiti-et-holokaustiteemaline-naitus-on-solvav "Ministeeriumis toimunud arutelul leiti, et holokaustiteemaline näitus on solvav"] Postimees, 11 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

As the museum was closed on Monday and Tuesday and the videos were already removed by Wednesday afternoon, the videos in question were introduced only to a small part of exhibition visitors. Therefore, majority of people who have participated in the debate have not been familiar with the content of the videos or knew them only on the basis of clips shown in the news and on the basis of written summaries.&lt;ref name="terev"&gt;[http://etv.err.ee/v/meelelahutus/terevisioon/saated/905777f5-f141-47fc-93a2-10b4d1763852 "Terevisioon"] ERR, 19 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The removal of videos has been evaluated differently. For example, journalist Kadri Veermäe from major Estonian daily [[Postimees]] interpreted it as a censorship or self-censorship.&lt;ref name="kultuuriinimesi" /&gt; On the other hand, [[Kaarel Tarand]], former editor-in-chief of Estonian main cultural newspaper [[Sirp]], did not consider this as a result of censorship.&lt;ref name="tarand"&gt;Siim Randla [http://www.ohtuleht.ee/662580/kaarel-tarand-ei-nae-holokausti-naituselt-teoste-eemaldamises-tsensuuri "Kaarel Tarand ei näe holokausti näituselt teoste eemaldamises tsensuuri", 16 February 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Estonian artist Kiwa regarded it as the criminalization of art.&lt;ref name="kiwa" /&gt;

After videos were removed, the museum decided to use that room do present the documentation about the public discussion about the exhibition on both traditional and social media, considering the themes of censure and self-censorship.&lt;ref name="Artel"&gt;Raimu Hanson [http://tartu.postimees.ee/3096479/rael-artel-naitustel-voiks-kaia-kunsti-aga-mitte-skandaali-parast "Rael Artel: näitustel võiks käia kunsti, aga mitte skandaali pärast"] Postimees, 19 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works and artists==
* In [[Yael Bartana]]'s video ''Dreams and Nightmares'' (''Mary Koszmary'', 2007), a politician is talking to a deserted overgrown stadium where only a handful of scouts are listening, about reconciliation on Jews and Poles, the need for Jews to return to restore Poland's cultural diversity and create a shared future.&lt;ref name="kataloog"&gt;[http://tartmus.ee/files/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Minu_Poola_A5_32lk_preview_final.pdf Näituse kataloog] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Estonian art theorist Indrek Grigor considers it to be the central work of the exhibition: ˮFor a person like me, for whom Jews have largely been just literary characters from [[Isaac Babel]]'s ''[[Odessa Tales]]'', this video gave a glimpse of the actual cultural shock Poland went through after the genocide. If we were to translate that experience into the context of Estonian culture we could try to reappraise the influence of Russian culture on Estonia's cultural diversity and its very viability!"&lt;ref name="Grigor"&gt;Indrek Grigor [http://kultuur.postimees.ee/3094745/veel-kord-holokaustinaitusest-neil-seal-poolas "Veel kord holokaustinäitusest: Neil seal Poolas"] Postimees, 17 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Zbigniew Libera]]'s photograph from the series ''Residents'' (2003) shows smiling people in analogous positions to people in a famous photograph depicting [[Auschwitz]] prisoners being released.&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt; 
* Documentation of ''Greetings from Jerusalem Avenue'' (2002) by [[Joanna Rajkowska]] introduces one of the most striking monuments of [[Warsaw]], the capital of Poland: an artificial palm tree, that artist conceived while visiting Jerusalem. This work reminds the cultural diversity of pre-war Poland. It is set up on the Jerusalem Avenue in Warsaw.&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt; ˮTo me the highlight of the documentation of Rajkowska's work presented on the exhibition is not actually connected with the author but with the human rights activist campaign where a traditional Palestinian headscarf was tied around the palm tree,ˮ says Indrek Grigor.&lt;ref name="Grigor" /&gt;
* John Smith's (a pseudonym used by [[Marko Mäetamm]] and [[Kaido Ole]]) painting ''Holocaust'' portrays two men driving through a landscape, seeing writing "Holocaust" on a hilltop in resemblance to the famous landmark "Hollywood". According to Artel, that painting draws attention to the commercialization of Holocaust by the movie industry led by Hollywood, as it has transformed the pain of millions of people into money.&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt;
* Installation ''Warsaw'' (2005) by [[Wilhelm Sasnal]] consists of the word ''Warsaw'' which is written on a white wall using a gunpowder-coated wire, cut in half into words WAR and SAW - "SAW WAR".&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt;
* Short comic by American artist [[Art Spiegelman]] ''Breakdowns: Portrait of the Artist as a Young %@?*!'' (2008) is describing Jewish family heirloom as a monster locked in a chest, creating a perpetual sense of guilt. It can be understood as the guilt of surviving Holocaust. [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning two-volume novel ''[[Maus]]'' (1991) by Spiegelman is also available on the exhibition.&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt; In the review of the exhibition, Indrek Grigor sees a parallel between Spiegelman's comic and the historical experience of Estonians: ˮ...just like the Jewish community is haunted by the Holocaust trauma from generation to generation as it has been shown on the exhibition by the autobiographical comics of American cartoonist Art Spiegelman; so, too, the present writer has a box of letters sent from Siberia to Estonia describing how people dug a pentagon shaped campfire, danced and played around it and thanked their dear leader Stalin for their daily bread."&lt;ref name="Grigor" /&gt;
* ''The Game of Tag'' (1999) by [[Artur Żmijewski (filmmaker)|Artur Żmijewski]] was exhibited on the 7th [[Berlin Biennale]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt;&lt;ref name="saksa"&gt;[http://maailm.postimees.ee/3086441/saksa-meedia-kirjutas-kullimangu-keelamise-puhul-tsensuurist-mitte-sokist "Saksa meedia kirjutas «Kullimängu» keelamise puhul tsensuurist, mitte šokist"] Postimees, 10 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The author commented his work on the Estonian news program ''[[Aktuaalne kaamera]]'' as follows: ˮIt is a very serious situation. There are the bodies of living people, the situation is alive – instead of a tragedy we just have life."&lt;ref name="autor" /&gt; In the publication which accompanies the exhibition, curator Rael Artel connected ''The Game of Tag'' with the notion of 'bare life' by philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] referring to a human being who has lost all legal rights and is not protected by any cultural conventions.&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt; In ''Postimees'', Kadri Veermäe wrote about the background of the video: "Certainly, there are many of those who have watched Żmijewski's ''The Game of Tag'' on the Internet and have been surprised that they are actually not that shocked. The one who was shocked was Żmijewski himself when he was an assistant teacher and went on an excursion to the camps with school children who started cheerfully playing tag in the concentration camp's gas chambers."&lt;ref name="Veermäe"&gt;Kadri Veermäe [http://arvamus.postimees.ee/3087869/kadri-veermae-kullimang-gaasikambris "Kullimäng gaasikambris"] Postimees, 12 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Estonian Jewish semiotician and culture theorist [[Mihhail Lotman]] interpretes the situation as follows: "A prospective viewer's cognitive dissonance between the game and Holocaust is the aspect that should be shocking. But this arises in the mind of the viewer, not on screen or at shooting. We can start by recognizing that none of the participants are Jewish /---/. Further, anyone who knows something about history knows that men and women were separated in the camps /---/. Maybe the best justification for this work (in terms of its quality I have big doubts) is that it can create a lot of grief. We need so little to bring back the memory of Holocaust."&lt;ref name="Lotman"&gt;Mihhail Lotman [http://www.lotman.ee/blogi/meie-vaike-holokaustiskandaal "Meie väike holokaustiskandaal"] Mihhail Lotman's blog, 11 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* The video ''80064'' (2004) by Artur Żmijewski features a conversation with former prisoner of Auschwitz Józef Tarnawa who, after a negotiation, lets the artist to renew his concentration camp tattoo.&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt; According to Żmijewski, it symbolizes renewing the man's honour: ˮIn the video he is handled like a monument from the past which must be kept in good condition. The other meaning is to repeat the violent act from the past. In both films I tried to reopen up the past, truly reopen, not just recall, but really jump into that past moment when the tattoo was made and people were in the gas chambers."&lt;ref name="autor" /&gt; Semiotician Mihhail Lotman regards the video as shocking but also multidimensional: ˮ92-year-old Auschwitz survivor Józef Tarnawa eventually agrees and lets to renew his tattoo 80064. The man asks not to do so, saying that it is visible enough and after, it would not be authentic etc. But director Artur Żmijewski is ruthless and soon the old man surrenders and lets them to renew his tattoo. In the end he is not happy with the result, he feels like a piece of furniture. In another interview the director says that of course he agreed in the end because he got 500 euros for it and they had a contract. The message here is vague and might be multidimensional /---/. I draw the attention of watchful jewish community to the aspect that no one said it is a Jew in the video. There is nothing distinctive about his appearances, even the artist says that he does not know what the old man's nationality is and that it doesn't even really matter. Maybe it is the Polish community who should protest?"&lt;ref name="Lotman" /&gt;

==Public response==
On the opening day, [[Eesti Televisioon]]'s news program ''Aktuaalne kaamera'' asked the chairwoman of Tartu Jewish Community Ilona Smuškina to visit the exhibition My Poland. She found it to be emotionally uncomfortable: ˮI couldn't watch the video of the gas chamber for more than three seconds. But the old man who was tortured in Auschwitz, now he is tortured by the young man who did this artwork."&lt;ref name="keelatud"&gt;[http://kultuur.err.ee/v/kunst/naitus/917d7a19-0d8a-4652-b3f5-2ddcaedec9b8 Tartus avatud holokaustinäitusel "Minu Poola" näidatakse ka Saksamaal keelatud töid] ERR, 6 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the chairwoman of Estonian Jewish Community, Alla Jakobson, spoke out in the media. She announced that she feels insulted, she does not consider Artur Żmijewski's videos to be art at all and insists they should be removed from the exhibition: ˮIt is unacceptable and inappropriate to exhibit videos like this in a Holocaust art exhibition."&lt;ref name="solvab"&gt;Kaarel Kressa [http://epl.delfi.ee/news/kultuur/tartu-naitus-solvab-juute?id=70761615 "Tartu näitus solvab juute"] EPL, 11 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 February, a public statement to Estonian state leaders by Estonian Jewish Community was made, saying: "It would be unthinkable to show nudity in an exhibition dedicated to [[Soviet deportations from Estonia]]. Why is Holocaust an exception justified with the artistic freedom?"&lt;ref name="vabandust" /&gt; Statement made after the opening of the exhibition found supporters by many organisations, politicians and cultural figures: Estonian member of European Parliament [[Urmas Paet]], Foreign Minister [[Keit Pentus-Rosimannus]], Minister of Culture [[Urve Tiidus]], Minister of Defence [[Sven Mikser]], former Minister of Regional Affairs [[Vallo Reimaa]], Chairman of Estonian Parliament [[Eiki Nestor]], former Minister of Culture [[Laine Randjärv]], former Mayor of Tallinn [[Jüri Ratas]], [[Estonian Islamic Congregation]], Tartu City Council's Commission of Culture, art historian [[Krista Piirimäe]], etc.&lt;ref name="arutelul" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pentus"&gt;[http://uudised.err.ee/v/eesti/6fd1cb04-c428-4aa2-b872-f9ba843bda7f "Pentus-Rosimannus: pean õigeks, et muuseum solvavad eksponaadid eemaldas"] ERR, 12.02.2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="empaatiavõimes"&gt;[http://uudised.err.ee/v/eesti/282bb1df-962c-421f-b659-29e03d5f4897 "Tiidus holokausti-näitusest: siin on küsimus empaatiavõimes"] ERR, 10 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mikser"&gt;[http://www.delfi.ee/news/paevauudised/eesti/mikser-inimsusevastane-kuritegu-ei-peaks-olema-naljategemise-objektiks?id=70777607 "Mikser: inimsusevastane kuritegu ei peaks olema naljategemise objektiks"] Delfi, 12 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nestor"&gt;Epp-Mare Kukemelk [http://www.delfi.ee/news/paevauudised/eesti/nestor-holokausti-teemalist-naitust-kohe-maha-votma-ei-hakkaks-ratas-soovitab-korraldajatel-ebasobivad-teosed-naituselt-eemaldada-ja-vabandada?id=70756917 "Nestor holokausti teemalist näitust kohe maha võtma ei hakkaks, Ratas soovitab korraldajatel ebasobivad teosed näituselt eemaldada ja vabandada"] Delfi, 10 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="islam"&gt;[http://uudised.err.ee/v/eesti/93e7a9b9-ca6c-4049-8541-7781ca9a42ec "Eesti Islami Kogudus toetab juudi kogukonna protesti Tartu Kunstimuuseumi näituse vastu"] ERR, 11 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kultuurikomisjon"&gt;Aune Rumm [http://tartu.ee/index.php?page_id=36&amp;lang_id=1&amp;menu_id=6&amp;lotus_url=/teated.nsf/web/viited/FC3DDFBBA52F17BFC2257DEA0056A566?OpenDocument "Volikogu kultuurikomisjon taunib holokaustiteema käsitlemisviisi Tartu Kunstimuuseumi näitusel"] Tartu Linnavolikogu pressiteade, 12 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Piirimäe"&gt;Krista Piirimäe [http://kultuur.postimees.ee/3086409/kunstiajaloolane-krista-piirimae-kritiseerib-teravalt-holokausti-teemalist-naitust "Kunstiajaloolane Krista Piirimäe kritiseerib teravalt holokausti-teemalist näitust"] Postimees, 10 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism directed to ''My Poland'' also escalated quickly in the international press, particularly in Russia and Israel. Among others, the [[Wiesenthal Center]]'s director [[Efraim Zuroff]] criticized the exhibition,&lt;ref name="zuroff"&gt;[http://kultuur.err.ee/v/kunst/uudis/b0c88f71-10ba-44ef-9477-ac3870b6dce4 "Zuroff: Tartus avatud näitus on haiglane irvitamine juutide massimõrva üle"] ERR, 9 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; stating that it is not enough to remove two videos as the whole exhibition should be shut down.&lt;ref name="Sokol"&gt;Sam Sokol [http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Estonian-museum-apologizes-for-exhibit-making-light-of-Holocaust-391191 Estonian museum apologizes for exhibit making light of Holocaust] The Jerusalem Post, 16 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Main critical arguments include joking about Holocaust, mocking,&lt;ref name="Mikser" /&gt; lack of empathy amongst the artists and the authors of the exhibition,&lt;ref name="empaatiavõimes" /&gt; and the need to identify the boundaries of art. "I think that there should be ethical boundaries of freedom of speech and freedom of expression of art that should not be prescribed by law but should be in the hearts of people," said Laine Randjärv. "Organizers of the exhibition have been ignoring the principles of good practices and the principles of respecting other people and nations," found Jüri Ratas.&lt;ref name="Nestor" /&gt; "The reaction and the triggered debate in the society leads us to ask again where are the boundaries of art," said Urve Tiidus.&lt;ref name="Tiidus juute"&gt;[http://www.postimees.ee/3087253/tiidus-juute-solvanud-naitusest-minu-jaoks-on-kusimus-empaatiavoimes "Tiidus juute solvanud näitusest: minu jaoks on küsimus empaatiavõimes"] Postimees, 10 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A couple of days later, first statements supporting the curator and Tartu Art Museum started to appear, mostly made by people of art and culture. The criticism was also disputed by the interview to Eesti Televisioon by the author of the most criticized videos, Artur Żmijewski, who said: "We recall the past events and it is not a passive recalling but an active one.

On ETV morning show ''Terevisioon'', Sirje Helme, the director of Estonian Art Museum Kumu, commented the situation as follows: ˮThis debate can't be about whether it is art or not. The question is, how far can an artwork go in its freedom to sharply touch this or that subject. /.../ I think that there are almost no limits in democratic freedom but some things are agreed upon not to be touched, and Holocaust is certainly one of those things. So the question is not whether it is a good or bad work of art, the problem is that it has touched a subject which is declared to be taboo in Europe and America. /.../ This is a political world, not a world of art. I think this subject does not belong to the art world." Anders Härm responded: ˮI think that there is no such rule. There is no theme more mediated than Holocaust if we talk about the horrors during the Second World War. The work by John Smith referred to this – commercialization of Holocaust. [[Jean Baudrillard]] and [[Umberto Eco]] have also talked about how Hollywood wouldn't let Jews to forgive and Germans to be forgiven." Sirje Helme said: ˮFor me, this question is in black and white. I will stick to my opinion that it is not about art with its aesthetical criteria and sensitivities. The question here is that the topic is sacred and only certain people can engage in it."&lt;ref name="härm" /&gt;

'''National Botanic Garden of Israel''' ('''The Botanical Garden for the Native Plants of Israel in memory of Montague Lamport''') [[Hebrew]]: הגן הבוטני לצמחי ארץ ישראל ע"ש מונטג'יו למפורט), not to be confused with [[Jerusalem Botanical Gardens]], which was originally planned as its successor, is a [[botanical garden]] located on the [[Mount Scopus]] campus of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. It covers an area of 25 dunams and contains 950 varieties of plants, 40% of them wild.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Green-Israel/People-and-The-Environment/The-Revival-of-Mount-Scopus-Botanical-Garden The revival of Mount Scopus Botanical Garden, [[Jerusalem Post]]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Overview==
The first botanical garden in the [[Land of Israel]], it records all the wild plants of Israel and the Middle East. The garden is located in the northern part of the Hebrew University campus on [[Mount Scopus]] in [[Jerusalem]]. Around the garden are many burial caves from the [[Second Temple]] period. In the western part of the garden is a small amphitheater. The garden is also a [[Nature reserve|Ecological nature reserve]] and [[National parks and nature reserves of Israel|National park]]. It incorporates a  Natural Teaching Center, the largest botanical library in Israel and a meteorological station. On the western side of the garden is trail walk named after the Israeli author [[Avigdor Hameiri]]. In the center of the trail, next to the main entrance, is a stone tablet inscribed with his famous song poem "On the summit of Mount Scopus."

== History ==
[[File:Visit Tomb of Nicanor 2011 29.jpg|thumb|Cave of Nicanor]]
The garden was established in 1931 on the northern side of the Hebrew University on Mount Scopus by [[Otto Warburg (botanist)|Otto Warburg]], who founded the university's Department of Botany  together botanist [[Alexander Eig]]. It was the first botanical garden in the [[Land of Israel]]. The garden was a highlight of the scientific and educational work of botanist Alexander Eig who continued to teach at the university until his death. He planted the first tree in the garden. He established a program to protect the local flora.  He collected plants in  Syria, Turkey, Iraq and Lebanon, brought seedlings from 350 [[Cedrus]].
 
The garden was the first home of the [[Jerusalem Biblical Zoo]]. The  Mt. Scopus period lasted from 1947 to 1950. In 1948, when there was no food in Jerusalem, zookeepers had to hunt stray dogs near garbage dumps to feed the carnivorous animals, many of which perished. Non-dangerous species had to be released. In 1950, with UN help, the animals were moved down into the city by weekly convoys.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sbl-site.org/publications/article.aspx?articleId=579 The Jerusalem Biblical Zoo]&lt;/ref&gt;

The garden had been neglected over 19 years, when the Mount Scopus campus was in an enclave under Israeli control surrounded by Jordan. Indeed in 1954 a new botanical garden was opened in western Jerusalem, near the [[Jewish National and University Library]], on the new campus of the [[Hebrew University]] in Givat Ram. In 1958 two Israelis soldiers were killed in the garden by Jordanian ambush, also the "United States Chairman of the Commission" that came to mediate was killed in this incident.

In 1980, it was decided to renew the garden, which was inaugurated in 1988.

The garden is the first in the world to be recognized as an "ecological garden," designed for nature conservation. Many of the species are very rare or non-existent in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/1.5074714 A garden variety, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Burial caves ===
[[file:Pinsker-Oshiskin.jpg|thumb|Graves of Leon Pinsker and Menachem Ussishkin]]
The [[Cave of Nicanor]] is an ancient burial cave from the [[Second Temple]] period discovered in 1902. An inscription  marked it as the grave of "Nicanor" who built the doors on the [[First Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]]. In 1934, the remains of [[Leon Pinsker]] from [[Odessa]] were reburied in the Nicanor cave at the initiative of [[Menachem Ussishkin]], who envisaged a national pantheon on Mt. Scopus.  However, the only other person buried there was Ussishkin himself, who died in 1941. A national leaders plot was established on [[Mount Herzl]] after the founding of the state in 1948, in part because Mount Scopus became an enclave in [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|Jordanian-ruled territory]].

[[Image:Pena-medio-cut.JPG|thumb|300px| [[Pena Palace]] in [[Sintra]], [[Portugal]] one of the points of reference for Neo-Romantic architecture]]
The term '''neo-romanticism''' is used to cover a variety of movements in philosophy, literature, music, painting, and architecture, as well as [[social movement]]s, that exist after and incorporate elements from the era of [[Romanticism]]. It has been used with reference to late-19th-century composers such as [[Richard Wagner]] particularly by [[Carl Dahlhaus]] who describes his music as "a late flowering of romanticism in a positivist age". He regards it as synonymous with "the age of Wagner", from about 1850 until 1890—the start of the era of [[Musical modernism|modernism]], whose leading early representatives were [[Richard Strauss]] and [[Gustav Mahler]] {{harv|Dahlhaus|1979|loc=98–99, 102, 105}}. It has been applied to writers, painters, and composers who rejected, abandoned, or opposed [[Realism (arts)|realism]], [[Naturalism (art)|naturalism]], or avant-garde modernism at various points in time from about 1840 down to the present.

== Late 19th century and early 20th century ==
Neo-romanticism as well as Romanticism is considered in opposition to naturalism—indeed, so far as music is concerned, naturalism is regarded as alien and even hostile {{harv|Dahlhaus|1979|loc=100}}. In the period following German unification in 1871, naturalism rejected Romantic literature as a misleading, idealistic distortion of reality. Naturalism in turn came to be regarded as incapable of filling the "void" of modern existence. Critics such as [[Hermann Bahr]], [[Heinrich Mann]], and [[Eugen Diederichs]] came to oppose naturalism and [[materialism]] under the banner of "neo-romanticism", demanding a cultural reorientation responding to "the soul’s longing for a meaning and  content in life" that might replace the fragmentations of modern knowledge with a holistic world view {{harv|Kohlenbach|2009|loc=261}}.

== Late 20th century ==
"Neo-romanticism" was proposed as an alternative label for the group of German composers identified with the short-lived ''[[New Simplicity|Neue Einfachheit]]'' movement in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Along with other phrases such as "new tonality", this term has been criticised for lack of precision because of the diversity among these composers, whose leading member is [[Wolfgang Rihm]] {{harv|Hentschel|2006|loc=111}}.

===1930–1955===
In British art history, the term "neo-romanticism" is applied to a loosely affiliated school of landscape painting that emerged around 1930 and continued until the early 1950s. It was first labeled in March 1942 by the critic [[Raymond Mortimer]] in the ''New Statesman''. These painters looked back to 19th-century artists such as [[William Blake]] and [[Samuel Palmer]], but were also influenced by French cubist and post-cubist artists such as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[André Masson]], and [[Pavel Tchelitchew]] ({{harvnb|Clark and Clarke|2001}}; {{harvnb|Hopkins|2001}}). This movement was motivated in part as a response to the threat of invasion during World War II. Artists particularly associated with the initiation of this movement included [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Ivon Hitchens]], and especially [[Graham Sutherland]]. A younger generation included [[John Minton (artist)|John Minton]], [[Michael Ayrton]], [[John Craxton]], [[Keith Vaughan]], [[Robert Colquhoun]], and [[Robert MacBryde]] {{harv|Button|1996}}.

'''Notability''' is the property of being worthy of notice, having fame, or being considered to be of a high degree of interest, significance, or distinction. It also refers to the capacity to be such. Persons who are notable due to public responsibility, accomplishments, or, even, mere participation in the [[celebrity]] industry are said to have a public profile.&lt;ref name=UKLeveson&gt;{{cite web|title=446 PART F {{!}} The Cultur e, Practices and Ethics of the Press: the Press and the Public|url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/hc1213/hc07/0780/0780_ii.pdf|work=The Leveson Inquiry|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|accessdate=April 22, 2013|page=445|quote=The category of people with a public profile also includes a third sub-group: individuals who are famous only for their celebrity, or put another way the mere fact of their having entered the public eye. These people are those who actively participate in the ‘celebrity industry,’ actively pursuing publicity’s sake, employing publicists to provide a steady stream of stories to the press and to inform paparazzi of their whereabouts, in order to ensure that they continue to appear in the public eye.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aesthetic theory ==
The concept arises in the philosophy of [[aesthetics]] regarding aesthetic appraisal.&lt;ref Name=AA&gt;''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3749507 Aesthetic Appraisal]'', Philosophy (1975), 50: 189-204, Evan Simpson&lt;/ref&gt; There are criticism of art galleries determining monetary valuation, or valuation so as to determine what or what not to display, being based on notability of the artist, rather than inherent quality of the art work.

== Journalism and marketing ==
Notability arises in decisions on coverage questions in [[journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Journalism in the age of the information society, technological convergence, and editorial segmentation'', Journalism February 2009 vol. 10 no. 1 109-125, Francisco José Castilhos Karam {{DOI|10.1177/1464884908098323}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marketers and newspapers may try to create notability to create [[celebrity]], [[Celebrity|fame]], or [[wikt:notoriety|notoriety]], or to increase sales, as in the [[yellow press]].

== Notables as the privileged class ==
The privileged class are sometimes called notables, when compared to peasants.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/179328 Notability and Revolution: Social Origins of the Political Elite in Liberal Spain, 1800 to 1853]'', Jesus Cruz&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Urban Notables and Arab nationalism: the politics of Damascus 1860-1920'', PS Khoury, 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-521-53323-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wikipedia content ==
{{main|Notability in Wikipedia}}
Notability of a subject determines which articles will be included or not at Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;Sharman Lichtenstein, Craig M. Parker, "Wikipedia model for collective intelligence: a review of information quality" ''[[International Journal of Knowledge and Learning]]'', Volume 5, Number 3-4 / 2009, pp. 254-272 {{DOI|10.1504/IJKL.2009.031199}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''[[The Wikipedia Revolution]]: How a Bunch of Nobodies Created the World's Greatest Encyclopedia'', [[Andrew Lih]] writes that notability is at the center of the debate as to what the world's greatest encyclopedia should be - {{Quote|''"One faction believes Wikipedia should contain pretty much anything, as long as it’s factual and verifiable.... On the other side of the debate are the ‘deletionists’, although this somewhat unfairly characterizes their view in a destructive way. Some prefer the word ‘exclusionists’. This camp believes it is important to strictly determine not only whether something is factual, but whether it is notable, whether it is worthy of being included in the pantheon of human knowledge..... At the center of the debate is notability, which is where inclusionists and deletionists have their skirmishes.&lt;ref name=WR&gt;Andrew Lih, Jimmy Wales ''The Wikipedia Revolution: How a Bunch of Nobodies Created the World's Greatest Encyclopedia'', 2009, p. 116 {{OCLC|488343590}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Emily Artinian compares this passage with [[Borges]]' ''[[The Library of Babel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Artinian "[http://www.bookarts.uwe.ac.uk/contrad09/conpdfs/artiniantalk.pdf Wikipedia Definitions of the Artist’s Book: a Neutral Point of View?]" &lt;small&gt;({{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903232044/http://www.bookarts.uwe.ac.uk/contrad09/conpdfs/artiniantalk.pdf |date=3 September 2013 }})&lt;/small&gt;, ''Traditional and Emerging Formats of the Book Conference'', University of the West of England, 9 July 2009, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Persons wanting to delete an article on the grounds of non-notability are called [[meta:deletionism|deletionists]]. Those not wanting to delete the article are called [[meta:inclusionism|inclusionists]].&lt;ref name=WR/&gt;

A team of [[computer scientist]]s at [[MIT]] and [[Rutgers University]] has used notability at Wikipedia to create a measure of hierarchy in a directed [[online social network]].&lt;ref&gt;Mangesh Gupte, Pravin Shankar, Jing Li, S. Muthukrishnan, Liviu Iftode, "[http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~iftode/www11_socialhierarchy.pdf Finding Hierarchy in Directed Online Social Networks]" ACM 978-1-4503-0632-4/11/03.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of hits from a search engine has been proposed as a measure of notability; Wikipedia does not recommend the use of Google's results.&lt;ref&gt;T Lawrence, N Pelkey, "[http://iczn.org/sites/iczn.org/files/BZN%2067(3)%20Comment%20on%20Case%203463.pdf 'Googleology': powerful tool or unreliable evidence?]" ''Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature'', Volume 67, Number 3, September 2010, p. 26,&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of [[citation]]s has been proposed as a measure of notability of a publication or author; the field of study is called [[citation analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Clarke, "[http://www.rogerclarke.com/SOS/AISCit0605.html A pilot citation analysis of Australian Information Systems Researchers]", 2006 (note: this self published website article is cited in ''Australasian Journal of Information Systems'', Volume 15, Number 2, 2009 - "Electronic Commerce publications and the implications for research quality output in Australia")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rens Scheepers, Helana Scheepers, Julie Fisher, "[http://journals.sfu.ca/acs/index.php/ajis/article/viewArticle/33?ads= Electronic Commerce publications and research in Australia: Implications of the Research Quality Framework]" ''Australasian Journal of Information Systems'', Volume 15, Number 2, 2009,&lt;/ref&gt;

Notability may be considered to be [[wikt:absolute|absolute]]ly [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]], e.g., inherently as the [[big bang]]; [[relativism|relatively]] objectively determinable using a [[Convention (norm)|convention]]al definition, which is [[subjectivity|subjectively]] determined by [[consensus]],&lt;ref&gt;Paula Berinstein, "[http://infotoday.com/searcher/mar06/berinstein.shtml Wikipedia and Britannica:The Kid’s All Right (And So’s the Old Man)]", ''Information Today''&lt;/ref&gt; e.g., an online encyclopedia consensus to consider all towns as being notable, no matter how small; or [[subjective experience|subjective]],&lt;ref&gt;Sharman Lichtenstein A1 and Craig M.

== Using fallacious reasoning to confer notability==
[[Name dropping]] and [[argument by authority]] are examples of attempts to confer notability by associating the name of something notable with something else in an attempt to establish notability of that thing.

Conferring notability is related to [[transitive relation|transitivity]] and the [[syllogism]]. If all A's are notable, and x is an A, then x is notable is true by syllogism, but if A is notable, and x is an element of A, then x is not necessarily notable. If x is more notable than y, and y is more notable than z, then x is more notable than z, but if person x considers A to be notable, and A is a subset of B, then x does not necessarily consider B to be notable; an example of an [[intentional context]] in the [[paradox of the name relation]].&lt;ref&gt;Dagfinn Føllesdal, ''Philosophy of Quine'' (2000) 5 volumes. {{ISBN|978-0-8153-3737-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2011}}

[[File:Masopust držíme 10.jpg|upright=1.2|thumbnail|Peruehty in [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]. 1910]]
'''Perchta''' or '''Berchta''' (English: '''[[Bertha]]'''), also commonly known as '''Percht''' and other variations, was once known as a [[goddess]] in [[Pre-Christian Alpine traditions|Alpine paganism]] in the Upper German and Austrian regions of the [[Alps]]. Her name may mean "the bright one" ([[Old High German]] ''beraht, bereht'', from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''brehtaz'') and is probably related to the name ''Berchtentag'', meaning [[Epiphany (holiday)|the feast of the Epiphany]]. [[Eugen Mogk]] provides an alternative etymology, attributing the origin of the name ''Perchta'' to the [[Old High German]] verb ''pergan'', meaning "hidden" or "covered".&lt;ref&gt;Mogk according to Natko.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Perchta is often identified as stemming from the same [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] goddess  as [[Holda]] and other female figures of German folklore (see [[Frija-Frigg]]). According to [[Jacob Grimm]] and [[Lotte Motz]], Perchta is Holda's southern cousin or equivalent, as they both share the role of "guardian of the beasts" and appear during the [[Twelve Days of Christmas]], when they oversee [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]].&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HiltonMotz"&gt;Motz according to Hilton 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Grimm says Perchta or Berchta was known "precisely in those Upper German regions where Holda leaves off, in Swabia, in Alsace, in Switzerland, in Bavaria and Austria."&lt;ref name=Grimm272&gt;Grimm, 1882:272.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Erika Timm]], Perchta emerged from an amalgamation of Germanic and pre-Germanic, probably [[Celts|Celtic]], traditions of the Alpine regions after the [[Migration Period]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Timm according to Natko.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Names of Perchta ==
Perchta had many different names depending on the era and region: Grimm listed the names ''Perahta'' and ''Berchte'' as the main names (in his heading), followed by ''Berchta'' in Old High German, as well as ''Behrta'' and ''Frau Perchta''. In [[Baden]], [[Swabia]], [[Switzerland]] and Slovenian regions, she was often called ''Frau Faste'' (the lady of the [[Ember days]]) or [[Pehta]] or 'Kvaternica', in [[Slovene language|Slovene]]. Elsewhere she was known as ''Posterli,'' ''Quatemberca'' and ''Fronfastenweiber''.&lt;ref name="Ginzburg"&gt;&lt;!--Year &amp; page?--&gt;Ginzburg&lt;!--Year &amp; page?--&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In southern [[Austria]], in [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] among the Slovenes, a male form of Perchta was known as ''Quantembermann'', in German, or ''Kvaternik'', in Slovene (the man of the four [[Ember days]]). Grimm thought that her male counterpart or equivalent is ''[[Berchtold]].''&lt;ref&gt;Grimm 1882:279.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional variations of the name include ''Berigl'', ''Berchtlmuada'', ''Perhta-Baba'', ''Zlobna Pehta'', ''Bechtrababa'', ''Sampa'', ''Stampa'', ''Lutzl'', ''Zamperin'', ''Pudelfrau'', ''Zampermuatta'' and ''Rauweib''.

==Depiction==
In some descriptions, Perchta has two [[shapeshifting|forms]]; she may appear either as beautiful and white as snow like her name, or as elderly and haggard.

In many old descriptions, Perchta had one large foot, sometimes called a goose foot or swan foot. Grimm thought the strange foot symbolized her being a higher being who could [[shapeshift]] to animal form. He noticed that Bertha with a strange foot exists in many languages (Middle German "Berhte mit dem fuoze", French "Berthe au grand pied", Latin "Berhta cum magno pede", Italian " Berta dai gran piè", title of a medieval epic poem of italian area): "It is apparently a [[swan maiden]]'s foot, which as a mark of her higher nature she cannot lay aside...and at the same time the spinning-woman's splayfoot that worked the [[treadle]]".&lt;ref&gt;Grimm 1882:280&amp;ndash;81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Tyrol she appears as little old woman with a very wrinkled face, bright lively eyes, and a long hooked nose; her hair is disheveled, her garments tattered and torn.&lt;ref name="Frazer240"/&gt;

== Traditional narratives ==
Initially, Perchta was the upholder of cultural taboos, such as the prohibition against [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] on holidays.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/30035166?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Smith, John B. "Perchta the Belly-Slitter and Her Kin: A View of Some Traditional Threatening Figures, Threats and Punishments." ''Folklore'' 115.2 (2004): 167-86]&lt;/ref&gt; In the folklore of [[Bavaria]] and [[Austria]], Perchta was said to roam the countryside at midwinter, and to enter homes during the twelve days between Christmas and Epiphany (especially on the [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]]). She would know whether the children and young servants of the household had behaved well and worked hard all year. If they had, they might find a small silver coin the next day, in a shoe or pail. If they had not, she would slit their bellies open, remove their stomach and guts, and stuff the hole with straw and pebbles.  She was particularly concerned to see that girls had spun the whole of their allotted portion of [[flax]] or wool during the year.&lt;ref name="Frazer240"&gt;Frazer 1920:240.&lt;/ref&gt; She would also slit people's bellies open and stuff them with straw if they ate something on the night of her feast day, other than the traditional meal of fish and gruel.&lt;ref name=Grimm272/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frazer240"/&gt;

The cult of Perchta, under which followers left food and drink for ''Fraw Percht'' and her followers in the hope of receiving wealth and abundance, was condemned in Bavaria in the ''Thesaurus pauperum'' (1468) and by [[Thomas Ebendorfer]] von Haselbach in ''De decem praeceptis'' (1439).

Later canonical and church documents characterized Perchta as synonymous with other leading female spirits: [[Holda]], [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], [[Herodias]], [[Richella]] and [[Abundia]].

== Related beings ==
[[Image:Perchtenmaske.jpg|thumb|right|190px|A ''Perchten'' mask]]

Grimm thought [[Holda]] is her equivalent while the [[Weisse Frauen]] may derive directly from Berchta in her white form.

The word ''[[Pre-Christian Alpine traditions#Perchten|Perchten]]'' is plural for '''Perchta''', and this has become the name of her entourage, as well as the name of animal masks worn in parades and festivals in the mountainous regions of Austria. In the 16th century, the Perchten took two forms: Some are beautiful and bright, known as the ''Schönperchten'' ("beautiful Perchten"). These come during the Twelve Nights and festivals to "bring luck and wealth to the people." The other form is the ''Schiachperchten'' ("ugly Perchten") who have fangs, tusks and horse tails which are used to drive out demons and ghosts. Men dressed as the ugly Perchten during the 16th century and went from house to house driving out bad spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer 1920:242-243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wagner"&gt;Wagner 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, ''[[The Devil|der Teufel]]'' is viewed as the most ''schiach'' ("ugly") ''Percht''  and ''Frau Perchta'' as the most ''schön'' ("beautiful") ''Percht''.

In Italy, Perchta is roughly equivalent with [[Befana|La Befana]], who visits all the children of Italy on the night before 6 January to fill their socks with candy if they are good or a lump of coal if they are bad.&lt;ref&gt;Illes, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
According to [[Jacob Grimm]] (1882), Perchta was spoken of in [[Old High German]] in the 10th century as '''Frau Berchta''' and thought to be a white-robed goddess who oversaw spinning and weaving, like the myths of [[Holda]].  He believed she was the feminine equivalent of [[Berchtoldstag|Berchtold]], and was sometimes the leader of the [[Wild Hunt]]. However, John B. Smith disagrees and suggests that Perchta represents the personification of the feast of the Epiphany (Perchta's Day), and is therefore not pre-Christian.&lt;ref name=Hopkin&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7A_XAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=perchta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0u82l3ozOAhXKaD4KHVgXCJkQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=perchta&amp;f=false Hopkin, David. "Folklore and the Historian", ''The Folklore Historian'', Vol. 17, Simon Bronner, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern celebrations==
In contemporary culture, Perchta is portrayed as a "rewarder of the generous, and the punisher of the bad, particularly lying children".&lt;ref name=Hopkin/&gt;
  
Today in Austria, particularly [[Salzburg]], where she is said to wander through [[Hohensalzburg Castle]] in the dead of night,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tBM6AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA563&amp;lpg=PA563&amp;dq=perchta&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8Yfmva8mcM&amp;sig=BsxUJZK-txAVoOjjm5mGzJ5TVUo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV-Pnl2ozOAhXGbj4KHaVRDoU4MhDoAQgpMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=perchta&amp;f=false Vivian, Mrs. Herbert. "The Perchten Dancers of Salzburg", ''The Wide World Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly of True Narrative, Adventure, Travel, Customs and Sport'', Vol. 21, 1908]&lt;/ref&gt; the Perchten are still a traditional part of holidays and festivals (such as the Carnival [[Fastnacht]]). The wooden animal masks made for the festivals are today called ''Perchten''.&lt;ref name="Wagner"/&gt;

In the [[Pongau]] region of Austria large processions of ''Schönperchten'' ("beautiful Perchten") and ''Schiachperchten'' ("ugly Perchten") are held every winter. Beautiful masks are said to encouraging financial windfalls, and the ugly masks are worn to drive away evil spirits.&lt;ref name=Gallon&gt;[http://www.iga.stir.ac.uk/showblog.php?id=186 Gallon, Stephanie. "Christmas Demons II - Krampus and Perchta", International Gothic Association, December 18, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other regional variations include the ''Tresterer'' in the Austrian [[Pinzgau]] region, the stilt dancers in the town of [[Unken]], the ''Schnabelpercht'' ("trunked Percht") in the [[Unterinntal]] region and the ''Glöcklerlaufen'' ("bell-running") in the [[Salzkammergut]]. A number of large [[Ski resort|ski-resort]]s have turned the tradition into a [[tourist]] attraction drawing large crowds every winter.

'''''Photo''''' is a [[France|French]] magazine about [[photography]] previously published by [[Hachette Filipacchi Médias]], and currently owned by EPMA. 

==History and profile==
''Photo'' was started by Hachette Filipacchi Médias as a monthly magazine in 1960.&lt;ref name="lyn"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynne Warren|title=Encyclopedia of Twentieth-Century Photography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cFVsBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1211|accessdate=3 January 2016|date=15 November 2005|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-135-20543-0|page=1211}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was modeled on the magazine ''American Photo''.&lt;ref name=lyn/&gt; The magazine is now published ten times a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photo magazines of the world|url=https://www.redbullphotography.com/news/photo-magazines-of-the-world|publisher=Red Bull Photography|accessdate=3 January 2016|date=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It concentrates on the artistic aspects of photography, rather than technical aspects. The editorial line is tripartite: fashion/nude/[[Glamour photography|glamour]], historical images of wars/guillotines/poverty or similar, and selected journalism news photos from around the world. It is read and distributed around the world, and is known featuring naked [[supermodel|models]], colorful saturated graphic images, and its annual [[amateur]] photography [[competition|contest]]. It was sold by Hachette Filipacchi in 2011.

'''Robert Cyril Stebbins''' (March 31, 1915 – September 23, 2013) was an American [[Herpetology|herpetologist]] and illustrator known for his field guides and popular books as well as his studies of reptiles and amphibians. His ''Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians'', first published in 1966, is still considered the definitive reference of its kind, owing to both the quality of the illustrations and the comprehensiveness of the text. A professor of zoology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], for over 30 years, he was the first curator of herpetology at the [[Museum of Vertebrate Zoology]], a 1949 [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim fellow]], and author of over 70 scientific articles.  His discovery of the [[ring species]] phenomenon in ''[[Ensatina]]'' salamanders is now a textbook example of [[speciation]], and he performed extensive research on the [[parietal eye]] of reptiles. He produced nature films, supported science education in primary grades, and organized conservation efforts that aided in the passing of the [[California Desert Protection Act of 1994|1994 California Desert Protection Act]]. After retirement he continued to paint, collect field notes, and write books. Stebbins is commemorated in the scientific names of three species: ''[[Batrachoseps stebbinsi]]'', the Tehachapi slender salamander; ''[[Anniella stebbinsi]]'', a legless lizard; and ''[[Ambystoma tigrinum|Ambystoma tigrinum stebbinsi]]'', the endangered Sonora tiger salamander.

Robert Stebbins was born on March 31, 1915, in [[Chico, California]], to parents [[Cyril A. Stebbins|Cyril Adelbert]] and Louise Stebbins (''née'' Beck). His father, born in Wisconsin of English descent,&lt;ref name="Mansfield1918"&gt;{{cite book|first=George C.|last= Mansfield|contribution=Cyril A.

The oldest of seven children, young Robert grew up learning about local birds and exploring the wildlife of Northern California.{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=563}} His mother, born in Switzerland and educated at the Normal School,&lt;ref name="Mansfield1918" /&gt; instilled a sense of artistry in Robert, painting pictures for Robert and his siblings in her spare time.{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=563}} When Stebbins was seven, his family moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, where his father worked on agricultural curriculum for children and taught at the University of California, Berkeley.{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=563}} Around the age of nine, his family moved to Southern California, living first in [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], then in [[Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles]]. Stebbins spent time hiking in the nearby [[Santa Monica Mountains]], exploring the wildlife and amassing a collection of bird and mammal specimens which he prepared and mounted himself. Stebbins attended [[North Hollywood High School]], where his father taught hygiene and agriculture. Robert graduated in 1933.{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=35}}{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=565}} He discovered his artistic talents around sixteen years old. His early work consisted of cartoons: he drew illustrations on classmates' clothing and contributed cartoons to youth magazines, winning several awards.{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=564}}{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=36}}

== University and early career (1933–1945) ==
Shortly after graduating high school, Stebbins enrolled in the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). He initially majored in [[civil engineering]], thinking it a better career option than biology, but became unhappy with the program. Struggling with poor performance and health issues related to congenital heart problems,{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=36}} he took a leave for year and a half. During his time in recuperation, he turned his attention back to natural history, and was persuaded to return to UCLA by [[Raymond B. Cowles|Raymond Cowles]], a biology professor there. Stebbins returned with enthusiasm despite the perceived lack of job security, remarking in 1985: "I was cautious because of the Great Depression, but I was determined to pursue biology even if it meant standing on a corner with a tin cup."{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=36}} He switched his major to zoology and graduated in 1940 with highest honors.{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=565}}
[[File:Coachella Valley Fringe-toed Lizard.JPG|thumb|left|A [[Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizard]], subject of much of Stebbins' graduate research]]
After graduating, Stebbins split his time between a summer job as a naturalist at [[Lassen Volcanic National Park]] and pursuing graduate school at UCLA. Over the next few years he also obtained teaching credentials in junior college, high school, and elementary education. Stebbins initially planned to study birds, with an eye towards [[roadrunner]]s, but felt the field of ornithology was too crowded, while herpetology, the study of reptiles and amphibians, offered more opportunities for new research.{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=36}} Cowles became his graduate advisor. The main focus of Stebbins' graduate research was the biology of [[fringe-toed lizard]]s, a group of sand-dwelling lizards of the American Southwest. For his master's degree (completed in 1942) he studied the anatomical structure of the nasal passages of the lizards, documenting in detail the looped, horseshoe-shaped structure of the nasal passages that functions as a [[Trap (plumbing)|u-trap]], preventing sand grains from being inhaled while the lizards lay buried at the sand's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stebbins|first= Robert C.|title= Adaptations in the nasal passages for sand burrowing in the saurian genus ''Uma''|journal=American Naturalist|year=1943|volume=77|number=768| pages= 38–52|jstor=2457379|doi=10.1086/281097}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Ph.D dissertation (completed in 1943) further explored the anatomical, behavioral, and physiological adaptations of the lizards.&lt;ref name="Stebbins 1944 Uma"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stebbins|first1=Robert C.|title=Some Aspects of the Ecology of the Iguanid Genus ''Uma''|journal=Ecological Monographs|date=1944|volume=14|issue=3|pages=311–332|doi=10.2307/1948446|jstor=1948446}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he also published on the behavior of the [[Crotalus cerastes|sidewinder rattlesnake]], and, with his father, produced two field guides to birds, providing illustrations to his father's text. Their first book, ''What Bird is That?'', was pressed in the family garage. Stebbins considered his father "a pioneer of sorts in the extensive use of drawings in teaching natural history," a tradition he later strove to continue in his own works.{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|pp=35-36}}

On June 8, 1941, Stebbins married Anna-rose Cooper, who would eventually type the text of all of Stebbins' field guides.{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=567}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art and Science Illuminate a Naturalist's Path|date=April 4, 2005|first=Louis |last=Sahagun|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/04/local/me-stebbins4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of their honeymoon was spent camping in the [[Owens Valley]] of southeastern California.{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=36}}

== Career (1945–1978) ==

In 1945 Stebbins was hired an assistant professor of zoology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and became the first curator of herpetology at the [[Museum of Vertebrate Zoology]], where he would remain throughout his career. The first faculty member to teach herpetology at Berkeley, he wrote new lab manuals, created the herpetology teaching collection, and co-taught a popular course on vertebrate natural history.{{sfn|Rodriguez-Robles ''et al.''|2003|p=6}}{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=42}}{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|pp=568–569}}

=== Ring species in salamanders ===
[[File:Ensatina eschscholtzii ring species.jpg|thumb|260px|The various forms of ''Ensatina'' constitute a ring around the Central Valley: adjacent forms interbreed throughout the ring except at the southern end, where two forms behave as separate species.]]
Stebbins soon became interested in ''[[Ensatina]]'' salamanders, which occur from British Columbia to Baja California and are present in both the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and [[California Coast Ranges|Coast Ranges]] of California but absent in the Central Valley. Finding the salamanders in Berkeley much different than the ones he was used to seeing in the mountains of Southern California, he embarked upon a research program examining color differences throughout California. In his resulting monograph, published in 1949, he proposed that the color varieties—many previously regarded as distinct species—were actually various races or [[subspecies]] of a single species that in most locations interbreed where two forms co-occur, creating hybrids that partially resemble both forms. However, at the southern edge of the Central Valley, where the Sierra foothill populations come into contact with those of the Coast Range, the populations do not interbreed, instead acting as distinct species. This phenomenon is known as a [[ring species|ring speciation]], with different populations representing different stages of [[speciation]], the process by which one species becomes two.{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=567}} Zoologist [[Arnold B. Grobman|Arnold Grobman]] called Stebbins' research "without doubt, the most outstanding study of a genus of American salamanders that has yet appeared."&lt;ref name="Grobman 1951"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Arnold|last= Grobman|title=Review: ''Speciation in Salamanders of the Plethodontid Genus Ensatina''| journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|volume= 26|number=1 |year=1951| pages= 49–50|jstor=2811314|doi=10.1086/397911}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ensatina'' complex has been the focus of research ever since, and is a widely used textbook example of evolutionary processes.{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=567}}

=== Reptilian parietal eye ===
Stebbins' early work with lizards in the southern California desert led to a series of papers from the 1950s through the 1970s exploring the [[parietal eye]] of reptiles (also called the "third eye", a tiny light-sensitive organ on the forehead) and the associated [[pineal gland]], both of which are now known to influence [[circadian rhythm]]s.{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|pp=40-41}}{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|pp=567–568}} Aided by a Senior Postdoctoral Fellowship from the National Science Foundation, Stebbins and colleagues found that lizards with the parietal eye surgically removed changed their behavior: they became active much earlier in the day, spent more time in the sun, and remained active much later than [[Scientific control|control]] lizards. Further studies over the next few decades focused on the parietal eye of the [[tuatara]], the pineal gland's effects on lizard reproductive behavior, and parietal skull openings in fossil "mammal-like reptiles" such as ''[[Lystrosaurus]]''.{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|pp=567–568}}&lt;ref name="Eakin1973"&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard M. |last=Eakin|title=The Third Eye|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pkDgJBd4O6oC|year=1973|publisher=University of California Press|pages=28–30|isbn=978-0-520-02413-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work had implications beyond reptile biology: Nobel laureate [[Julius Axelrod]], after reading the work of Stebbins and others, began investigating the pineal gland in mammals, with emphasis on the effect of [[melatonin]] on activity cycles. Melatonin has since been found to influence human health.{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|pp=40–41}} Stebbins was proud of his parietal and pineal work, calling it "possibly the single piece of research which gives me the most satisfaction."{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=41}}

=== Other research, conservation, and field guides ===
In 1949 Stebbins received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] that allowed him to extend his studies throughout the western United States and to collect enough material to begin preparing his first amphibian field manuals.{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|pp=37-40}} The first of these to appear was ''Amphibians of Western North America'' (1951, University of California Press), covering the U.S. and Canada roughly west of the [[102nd meridian west|102nd meridian]]. Praised for its thoroughness as well as its illustrations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Frogs and Salamanders |first=E. R.|last= Dunn|journal= [[The Scientific Monthly]]|volume= 74|number=4|year=1952|page=239|jstor=20419}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bogert 1952" /&gt; the book "unquestionably provides more information concerning the 51 species … covered than any preceding it," wrote [[Charles M. Bogert]]: "The maps provided for each species and subspecies are on the whole the most detailed and accurate of any thus far published."&lt;ref name="Bogert 1952"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bogert|first1=Charles M.|title=Open Door to the Amphibia of Western North America|journal=[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]]|date=1952|volume=33|issue=3|page=435|doi=10.2307/1932844|jstor=1932844}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stebbins' second herpetological field guide, ''Amphibians and Reptiles of Western North America'' (1954, [[McGraw-Hill]]), was similarly praised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first= Karl P.|last= Schmidt|title=Review: ''Amphibians and Reptiles of Western North America.''|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|series= New Series|volume= 121|number= 3137|year=1955|page= 201|jstor=1682630|doi=10.1126/science.121.3137.200}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Galápagos Lava Lizard 02 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left| Stebbins studied thyroid and pineal function in [[Galápagos lava lizard]]s]]
In 1964 Stebbins visited the Galápagos Islands on a research expedition and studied the ecology and behavior of [[marine iguana]]s and [[Microlophus|lava lizards]]. Also on the expedition was [[Roger Tory Peterson]], who recalled "While the rest of were enjoying high adventure on the more remote islands and sea-girt rocks, he patiently snared 200 frisky lizards with a noose of thread suspended from a rod. He took their cloacal temperatures, marked them with dye, and then dosed them with radioactive iodine, which enabled him to locate the elusive reptiles later with a Geiger counter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peterson|first1=Roger Tory|contribution=Editor's Note|editor-last=Stebbins|editor-first=Robert C.|title=A Field guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians|edition=2nd|date=1985|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|isbn=0395082110|pages=v–vi}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|pp=41-42}}&lt;ref&gt;For details, see {{cite journal|last1=Stebbins|first1=Robert C.|last2=Lowenstein|first2=Jerold M.|last3=Cohen|first3=Nathan W.|title=A field study of the lava lizard (''Tropidurus albemarlensis'') in the Galapagos Islands|journal=Ecology|year=1967|volume=48|issue=5|page=839|doi=10.2307/1933742|jstor=1933742}} and {{cite journal|last1=Lowenstein|first1= Jerold M.|last2= Stebbins|first2= Robert C.|year=1969|title= Iodine metabolism and thyroid activity in parietalectomized tropical lizards|journal= [[Copeia]]|pages=664–669|jstor=1441790|volume=1969|issue= 4|doi=10.2307/1441790}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Stebbins produced what became his best-known book, ''A Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians'' ([[Peterson Field Guides]]), which Peterson called "a classic... one of the most beautiful as well as scholarly works in the series".{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=35}}

Stebbins was also committed to education and conservation. He made appearances on the TV series ''[[Science in Action (TV series)|Science in Action]]'', traveled to Asia to promote science education, and chaired a U.C. elementary school science project which recommended that science be taught to children as early as six.{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=42}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Study Science at Six|journal= The Science News-Letter|volume=80|number=1| year=1961|page= 5|publisher=

(1967). Stebbins co-authored revisions of the widely used textbooks ''General Zoology'' (5th ed.,1972; 6th ed., 1979) and ''Elements of Zoology'' (4th ed., 1974), books originally written by [[Tracy Storer]] and [[Robert Usinger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review: ''General Zoology'' by Tracy I.

In the late 1960s Stebbins became concerned about the impacts that increasingly popular [[off-road vehicle]] (ORV) driving was having on desert ecosystems of southern California—witnessing environmental degradation in some of the same places he had studied during graduate school—and became actively involved in over a decade of conservation efforts.{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=42}} Stebbins and colleagues studied the diversity of organisms in and around ORV areas, communicated research to [[Bureau of Land Management]] officials, and petitioned President [[Jimmy Carter]] to limit all-terrain vehicle use in deserts.&lt;ref name="Louv1996"&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard|last= Louv|authorlink=Richard Louv|title=The Web of Life: Weaving the Values That Sustain Us|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p8aCOjVmtGMC&amp;pg=PA137|year=1996|publisher=Conari Press|isbn=978-1-57324-140-3|pages=137–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=570}} Stebbins faced opposition from ORV riders and their lobbyists: ''[[American Motorcyclist]]'' magazine called him a "staunch abolitionist in the war against motorized vehicles in the desert."&lt;ref name="AM 1991"&gt;{{cite journal|author=|title='Scientific' exhibit blasts desert riders|journal=American Motorcyclist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IvkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA38|date=July 1991|pages=38–39|issn=0277-9358|author1=Assoc|first1=American Motorcyclist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stebbins' efforts eventually helped secure the passing of the [[California Desert Protection Act of 1994]] which established the [[Mojave National Preserve]] and elevated [[Joshua Tree National Park|Joshua Tree]] and [[Death Valley National Park|Death Valley]] from national monuments to more protected national parks.{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=42}}&lt;ref name="NY Times obit" /&gt;  In 1998 Stebbins was recognized in the U.S. Congress by Representative [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]] and the ''[[Contra Costa Times]]'' as one of 10 environmental leaders deemed "national treasures" for their activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Miller|last=George|contribution=Salute to 10 Bay Area Environmental Leaders|title=[[Congressional Record]] V. 144 part 14: September 9, 1998 to September 21, 1998|contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eDRmm0xOEfMC&amp;pg=PA19809|date=September 9, 1998|publisher=Government Printing Office|pages=19809–19810|id=GGKEY:1EU8A396D22|quote=Robert Stebbins, 83.

== Retirement years (1978–2013) ==
After retiring, Stebbins remained active in painting, conservation, and education, and continued to make natural history observations. He revised his well-known and widely used ''Field Guide'' in 1985 and again in 2003. He co-wrote the non-specialist book ''A Natural History of Amphibians'' with former student Nathan Cohen in 1997, and revised his ''Field Guide to California Amphibians and Reptiles'' in 2012, with new contributions by Samuel McGinnis, another former student. In 2009 he produced ''Connecting With Nature: A Naturalist's Perspective'', a book intended to help connect children with nature. He took additional art lessons, broadened his subject matter to include landscapes, African wildlife, portraits, and still lifes, and took up the violin, which he had studied decades earlier.{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=43}}  His paintings have been shown and sold in galleries and museums in Berkeley, Palm Springs, and Oregon.{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=564}}{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=43}}

== The "Stebbins" ==
[[File:Stebbins Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians cover.jpg|thumb|alt= Three illustrations beneath the bold title text: a frog in profile, the underside of a frog, and a snake|Cover of first edition]]
Stebbins' book ''A Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians'', first published in 1966 and revised in 1985 and 2003, has widely been considered "the bible of the field" for American herpetologists.&lt;ref name="Louv1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Robert C.

What [Stebbins] did was help make a transition to a similar situation as bird watching, where it became OK to just look at the animals and leave them alone."&lt;ref name="LA Times obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Robert C.

In 1966, the [[Houghton-Mifflin Company]] first published ''A Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians'' as part of its [[Peterson Field Guide]] series. While including some illustrations from Stebbins' previous books, the high quality of the artwork was immediately recognized, as was the quality and thoroughness of the writing.&lt;ref name="WakeCopeia1967"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wake|first=David B.|title=Review: ''A Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians''|journal=Copeia|volume=1967|number=2 |year=1967|pages= 500–501|jstor=1442166|doi=10.2307/1442166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologist [[David Wake]], then of the University of Chicago but later to work with Stebbins at Berkeley, considered the only "serious defect" to be absence of any coverage of snake-bite first aid. Wake also noted that the geographic area covered left a gap ranging from 75 miles to over 400 miles wide when paired with the earlier Peterson Guide to eastern reptiles and amphibians by [[Roger Conant (herpetologist)|Roger Conant]].&lt;ref name="WakeCopeia1967" /&gt;

The second edition, published in 1985, included several changes such as 37 new species, 12 new plates of illustrations, the inclusion of endemic species of the [[Baja California Peninsula]], and new common names chosen to enhance clarity. In his 1986 review, Sweet remarked on the frankness of imperfect knowledge: "For the first time we have a field guide that indicates clearly which taxonomic interpretations are tentative and where distributions and life history features remain poorly known."&lt;ref name="Sweet Copeia 1986"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Samuel S.|last= Sweet|title=Review: ''A Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians'', 2nd ed.|journal=Copeia|volume= 1986|number=1|year=1986|pages= 262–263|jstor=1444927|doi=10.2307/1444927}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned about the impact of over-collecting, Stebbins reduced coverage of collecting and keeping animals, and also removed a section on handling venomous snakes.{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=43}}

The third edition, published in 2003, included 36 new species and several new paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stebbins|first1=Robert C.|title=A Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians|date=2003|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-395-98272-3|edition=3rd|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stebbins considered keeping up-to-date with current scientific literature the most daunting task due to the volume of recent publications.{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=565}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1320">The '''Singapore Art Show''' is a bi-annual show organised by the [[National Arts Council (Singapore)|National Arts Council]] focusing on local [[visual artist]]s. The inaugural show was in 2005.

==Overview==
The Singapore Art Show is a platform for both established and up-and-coming [[Singapore]]an [[visual artist]]s to showcase their artworks. It also serves as an avenue for public appreciation of the diverse visual arts practices found in the country.

It showcases artwork from various genres and medium by Singapore artists. Simultaneously, the show engages the visual arts community through outreach components, [[public art]], platforms for the discovery of new talents, and awards.

== Integration with the Singapore Biennale ==

The Singapore Art Show is part of a framework of two bi-annual visual arts platforms which together provide a diverse showcase of visual arts in the country. The other event is the [[Singapore Biennale]] which develops and presents [[South-east Asia]]n and [[Asia]]n contemporary art in the international scene.

These two biennials are organised on alternate years.

The '''Sripuranthan Natarajan Idol''', is a 900-year-old statue of [[Nataraja]]n — the dancing Shiva — that was stolen from the ancient Brihadeeswarar temple of [[Sripurandan (North)|Sripuranthan]], smuggled to the United States, and then sold to the [[National Gallery of Australia]], Canberra with a false provenance, for US$5.1 million. The statue was consequently returned by Australia to the Indian government on ethical grounds, once questions were raised on due diligence not being followed during the acquisition.&lt;ref name=Mariappan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mariappan|first1=Julie|title=Stolen Nataraja, Ardhanariswara idols return to the land of temples|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Stolen-Nataraja-Ardhanariswara-idols-return-to-the-land-of-temples/articleshow/42282580.cms|accessdate=29 September 2015|issue=Chennai|publisher=The Times of India|date=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nataraja==
{{main article|Nataraja}}
Nataraja ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: "நடராசர்" or ''Kooththan'' "கூத்தன்; ''The Lord (or King) of Dance'') is a depiction of the [[Hindu deities|Hindu God]] [[Shiva]] as the cosmic dancer who performs his divine dance to destroy a weary universe and make preparations for the god [[Brahma]] to start the process of creation. The dance of Shiva in Tillai, the traditional name for [[Chidambaram]], forms the motif for all the depictions of Shiva as Nataraja. He is also known as "Sabesan" which splits as "Sabayil aadum eesan" in Tamil which means "The Lord who dances on the [[dais]]". The form is present in most Shiva temples in South India and is the prime deity in the famous [[Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Thillai Nataraja Temple]] at [[Chidambaram]].&lt;ref name=Coomaraswamy&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coomaraswamy|first1=Ananda Kentish|title=The dance of Siva; fourteen Indian essays|date=1918|publisher=The Sunrise Turn Inc.|location=New York|url=https://archive.org/details/danceofsivafourt01coomuoft|page=58|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture is usually made in bronze, with Shiva dancing in an [[aureole]] of flames, lifting his left leg (in rare cases, the right leg) and balancing over a demon or dwarf (Muyalaka) who symbolizes ignorance. It is a well-known sculptural symbol in India and popularly used as a symbol of Indian culture.&lt;ref name=Nitin&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kumar|first1=Nitin|title=Shiva as Nataraja - Dance and Destruction In Indian Art|url=http://www.exoticindiaart.com/article/nataraja|website=Exotic India|accessdate=29 September 2015|date=January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Udayarpalayam]] [[tehsil|taluk]] of the [[Ariyalur district|Ariyalur District]], in [[Tamil Nadu]], India has nearly 463 ancient temples, of which 200 belong to the [[Chola]] period dated 9th to 10th century AD. Most of these temples haven't seen maintenance for many decades and have lax security. Local thieves used to target the idols for their metal content, usually melting them. Some idols are pure gold, silver and panchaloha — five precious metals. However, the entry of international smuggling cartels has changed the situation. With antique [[Chola]] art being worth millions in the international market, idol thieves were recruited to lift them from the temples. In 2008, one such gang allegedly recruited by New York-based art dealer [[Subhash Kapoor (art dealer)|Subhash Kapoor]] was responsible for stealing eight idols from the Brihadeeswarar temple at Sripuranthan, 18 idols from the Varadharaja Perumal temple, and in 2010, 6 panchaloha idols from Chozeeshwarar temple at Vikiramangalam.&lt;ref name=Ezhilarasan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ezhilarasan|first1=K|title=God’s guards missing in action|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/magazine/article572197.ece?service=print|accessdate=29 September 2015|publisher=The New Indian Express|date=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subhash Kapoor==
{{main article|Subhash Kapoor (art dealer)}}
Subhash Kapoor owned an upscale Indian art dealership called 'Art of the Past' in [[Manhattan]], USA. Across the years, he had built a good working relationship with international art galleries, as a reputable dealer of Indian antiques. Following accusations of illegal dealing, Kapoor's gallery was raided by Homeland Security and stolen artwork worth 100 million was seized. Subhash Kapoor was arrested in Germany and extradited to India to face trial. As of 2016 He is lodged at the [[Puzhal Central Prison]] in Tamil Nadu, India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arunchalam|first1=Pon Vasanth|title=Subhash Kapoor remanded in Pazhavoor idol theft case|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/Subhash-Kapoor-remanded-in-Pazhavoor-idol-theft-case/article16947182.ece|work=The Hindu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; facing charges for criminal conspiracy to stealing antique idols which carries a maximum sentence of 14 years.

==Idol theft from Sripuranthan==
According to the Art investigative website, Chasing Aphrodite, Kapoor traveled to India and met Sanjivi Asokan, a kingpin of a ring of idol thieves. In 2006, thieves were hired for US$12,000 for stealing eight idols — Nataraja and Uma Mashewari, [[Ganesha|Vinayagar]], Devi, [[Lakshmi|Deepalaksmi]], Chandrashekarar, [[Sambandar|Sampanthar]] and [[Krishna]]r — from the dilapidated Brihadeeswarar temple at Sripuranthan. Worship at the temple had ended a long time ago, as it was plagued by scorpions and poisonous bugs; it was locked and had fallen into ruins. The theft occurred on three occasions starting in January 2006, with the thieves carefully gluing back the lock, using a lorry (truck) parked on the dry river bed behind the temple as the getaway vehicle. Soon after the theft, pictures of the stolen idols were sent to Kapoor in October 2006. The idols were mixed with new replicas to fool customs officials, and exported out of India by a company called Ever Star International Services Inc. to New York, where it was received by Nimbus Imports Exports, a company owned by Kapoor. Soon after Kapoor obtained a certificate from the [[Art Loss Register]] (ALR) stating that the Nataraja idol was not on the stolen artefacts register.

At this point, the ALR had no information on the stolen Nataraja, as the theft of the idols was discovered by the villagers only in 2008. The discovery was when officials of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]], [[Government of India]] arrived in the village for removing the idols from the temple for safekeeping, when the glued lock and missing idols were discovered. A [[First Information Report]] (FIR 133/2008) was filed at the Vikramangalam Police Station in this regard. The Economic Offenses Wing of the [[Tamil Nadu Police]] released pictures of the missing idols on its website.&lt;ref name=Aphrodite&gt;{{cite web|last1=Felch|first1=Jason|title=SCOOP: New Evidence Of Stolen Idols at the National Gallery of Australia|url=http://chasingaphrodite.com/2013/06/04/scoop-new-evidence-of-stolen-idols-at-the-national-gallery-of-australia/|website=Chasing Aphrodite: The Hunt for Looted Antiquities in the World's Museums|accessdate=29 September 2015|date=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Australian&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boland|first1=Michaela|last2=Hodge|first2=Amanda|title=Town prays for its stolen god Shiva to return|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/town-prays-for-its-stolen-god-shiva-to-return/story-e6frg8n6-1226848649572|accessdate=29 September 2015|publisher=The Australian|date=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Datta&gt;{{cite news|last1=Datta|first1=Damayanti|title=Mystery of the missing Gods|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/brihadeeswara-temple-sripuranthan-shiva-nataraja/1/355127.html|accessdate=29 September 2015|publisher=India Today|date=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EOW&gt;{{cite web|title=Photocopies of Antique Metal Idols Stolen from Sivan Temple at Sripuranthan Village at Ariyalur District in Tamil Nadu|url=http://www.tneow.gov.in/IDOL/idols_foreign.pdf|website=Tamil Nadu Police: Economic Offences Wing|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Decoding&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pradeep|title=Mystery of the missing 1000 yr old Gods in INDIA - Traced to USA and Australian National Gallery Of Art|url=http://hinduismdecoded.blogspot.com.au/search/label/DEMOLISHED%20INDIAN%20HINDU%20TEMPLES|website=Decoding Hinduism|accessdate=6 October 2015|date=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition by the National Galley of Australia==
The National Gallery of Australia (NGA) was keen to enhance its collection of Indian art. In 2008, the NGA, under Ron Radford, director and Robyn Maxwell, senior curator Asian art, acquired the dancing Shiva from Subhash Kapoor. The provenance provided stated that the idol was sold by Raj Mehgoub of Grand Central Parkway to Subhash Kapoor. Further, it was claimed the idol was acquired in New Delhi in 1970 (a year before the Indian government banned the export of antiquities from India), by Raj's late husband Abdullah Mehgoub, who was a Sudanese diplomat serving in India between 1968 and 1971. A sales receipt dated 15 April 1970, issued by Uttam Singh &amp; Sons, Jama Masjid, Delhi, to Abdulla Mehgoub of Defence Colony, New Delhi was produced as part of the provenance. US$5.1 million was paid by the National Gallery of Australia for the idol.&lt;ref name=4corners&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDermott|first1=Quentin|last2=Richards|first2=Deborah|title=The Dancing Shiva|url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/stories/2014/03/24/3968642.htm|accessdate=29 September 2015|agency=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Morgan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morgan|first1=Joyce|title=Is the NGA's 'looted' Shiva a statue of naivety?|url=https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/law-crime/2014/03/15/the-ngas-looted-shiva-statue-naivety/1394802000|accessdate=29 September 2015|publisher=The Saturday Paper|date=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aphrodite2&gt;{{cite web|last1=Felch|first1=Jason|title=UPDATED &gt; Radford Speaks, RETIRES: Director of Australia’s National Gallery Is In Denial|url=http://chasingaphrodite.com/tag/shiva-nataraja/|website=Chasing Aphrodite: The Hunt for Looted Antiquities in the World's Museums|accessdate=29 September 2015|date=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theft exposed==
The investigative website Chasing Aphrodite was the first to expose that the Shiva idol acquired by the NGA was a stolen artwork from Southern India. The story was picked up by Australian and Indian news agencies and widely reported. New York Police recovered pictures of the idol from Kapoor's house, where it appeared in a contemporary Indian house environment, discounting the claim that the idol has been outside India since 1971. Records of the idol had been maintained at the [[French Institute of Pondicherry]], with three photo records from different periods. Further, a 75-year-old farmer, Govindarajan, had a 30-year-old picture of Natarajan and his consort, which was taken by a photographer from [[Kumbakonam]]. Using this information, The Hindu newspaper ran an article comparing photos — a photo of the Sripuranthan Natarajar idol from the French Institute of Pondicherry taken in 1994, photos of the idol recovered by New York Police during the raid of Kapoor's house, and the photo of the idol displayed at the National Gallery of Australia. It concluded all the photos were of the same idol, showing seven similarities 
* 27 flames around the circle
* Left leg pointing between the 3rd and 4th flame
* Waist cloth of shiva merged with the 23rd and 24th flame
* 3rd flame slightly damaged
* 12th and 13th flame damaged
* 17th flame damaged
* Flowing hair damaged
However, the National Gallery of Australia, continued to deny that the artwork was stolen, refused to return it, and continued to display it in the gallery, without any note of its doubtful provenance. This stand was criticised by the Australian media, with Duncan Chappell, criminology expert from University of Sydney, calling it in-appropriate and an international embarrassment. The Government of India formally requested the artwork to be returned, under the UNESCO [[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|convention on stolen antiquities]].&lt;ref name=4corners /&gt;&lt;ref name=Srivathsan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Srivathsan|first1=A|title=Claim flawed, Australian gallery is keeping stolen idol|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/claim-flawed-australian-gallery-is-keeping-stolen-idol/article5764979.ece?mstac=0|accessdate=29 September 2015|issue=Chennai|publisher=The Hindu|date=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SMH&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kleinman|first1=Rachel|last2=Dhillon|first2=Amrit|title=The National Gallery of Australia dances into trouble with Shiva|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/the-national-gallery-of-australia-dances-into-trouble-with-shiva-20140317-34xui.html|accessdate=29 September 2015|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PoetryinStone&gt;{{cite web|last1=Poetry in Stone|title=The Return of the Dancer|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdHBwCn-wRw|website=Youtube|accessdate=29 September 2015|date=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigative site ''Poetry in Stone'' published a list of stories named as the 'Kapoor Files', showing that several of the stolen idols stolen from Sripuranthan and Suthamalli had appeared in consecutive 'Art of the Past' catalogues. The site compared the photos published in the Kapoor catalogs with the photos of the stolen idols as recorded by the [[French Institute of Pondicherry]] and pointed out the similarities.&lt;ref name=Vijay&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vijay|title=Poetry In Stone|url=http://poetryinstone.in/|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to India==
In March 2014, Ron Radford, the director of the National Gallery of Australia, removed the idol from display. In September 2014, the Australian government returned the Natarjar idol to India, along with another stolen antique idol of Shiva as Ardhanarishvarar which was displayed at the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]]. The two were handed over by the then Australian Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]] to the Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] on 5 September 2014, at [[New Delhi]].

The Nataraja idol was then moved to [[Madras]] and stored in the safe room of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] office at [[Fort St. George]], before being produced before the judicial magistrates of Jayamkondam and Vridhachalam.&lt;ref name=SMH2&gt;{{cite news|last=Bourke|first=Latika|author-link=Latika Bourke|title=Dancing Shiva to be returned during Abbott's India visit|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/dancing-shiva-to-be-returned-during-abbotts-india-visit-20140904-10cqvy.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401230542/http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/dancing-shiva-to-be-returned-during-abbotts-india-visit-20140904-10cqvy.html|archivedate=1 April 2016|accessdate=29 September 2015|publisher=Fairfax Media|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomsen&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomsen|first1=Simon|title=Australian PM Tony Abbott Returns National Gallery's $6 Million Stolen Shiva Sculpture To India|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/australian-pm-tony-abbott-returns-national-gallerys-6-million-stolen-shiva-sculpture-to-india-2014-9|accessdate=29 September 2015|publisher=Business Insider Australia|date=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hindu-Special&gt;{{cite news|title=Two idols brought back from Australia, now in Chennai|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/two-idols-brought-back-from-australia-now-in-chennai/article6404525.ece|accessdate=29 September 2015|issue=Chennai|publisher=The Hindu|date=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, the Nataraja idol was paraded on the streets of Sripuranthan, under tight security. It was temporarily placed in its original damp stone altar. However, officials made it clear that the statue would be displayed at the government museum at [[Kumbakonam]] and will be brought into Sripuranthan for annual festivities. The consort of Nataraja was traced to the [[Asian Civilisation Museum]] at Singapore, and the [[Government of Singapore]] agreed for its return to India.

Overall four of the eight statues stolen from Sripuranthan were traced, with three to the United States and one to Singapore.&lt;ref name=Chronicle /&gt;&lt;ref name=Amanda&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hodge|first1=Amanda|title=Tamil Nadu village turns out to welcome home Dancing Shiva|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/visual-arts/tamil-nadu-village-turns-out-to-welcome-home-dancing-shiva/story-fn9d3avm-1227117614396|accessdate=29 September 2015|publisher=The Australian|date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=4traced&gt;{{cite news|title=Four stolen idols traced|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/four-stolen-idols-traced/article6420962.ece|accessdate=29 September 2015|issue=Ariyalur|publisher=The Hindu|date=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, the Natarajar idol was re-united with its consort Uma Parmeshwari, at the ASI Icon Centre, Kumbakonam, after nearly 8 years. The Singapore Civilisation Museum had finally returned the Uma Parmeshwari after long negotiations with the Indian Government.&lt;ref name="DC-Uma2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=In icon centre, Uma Parmeshwari reunites with Nataraja after 8 years|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/020316/in-icon-centre-uma-parmeshwari-reunites-with-nataraja-after-8-years.html|accessdate=8 June 2016|publisher=Deccan Chronicle|date=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Subhash Kapoor's arrest alarmed museums all over the world, as they started investigating their purchases from his gallery. The [[Linden Museum]] in Germany returned to the Indian government a 9th-century AD idol of Mahishasumardini, stolen from Pulwama district in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] in the 1990s, which had been acquired from Kapoor. The [[Toledo Museum of Art]] in Ohio returned four artifacts acquired from Kapoor, including the Vinayagar statue stolen from Sripuranthan. The other antiques are a stone idol of Varaha Rescuing the Earth (acquired 2001), Mughal origin 18th-century enamel with gold box (acquired 20008), and a watercolour Rasikapriya from the Samdehi Ragini (acquired 2010).&lt;ref name=Nair&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nair|first1=Sobhana K|title=Germany to return 9th Century Idol|url=http://www.bangaloremirror.com/news/india/Germany-to-return-9th-century-idol/articleshow/49016436.cms|accessdate=29 September 2015|publisher=Bangalore Mirror|date=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TOI-Ohio&gt;{{cite news|title=US museum to return Ganesha idol stolen from TN by Kapoor|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/US-museum-to-return-Ganesha-idol-stolen-from-TN-by-Kapoor/articleshow/49147360.cms|accessdate=29 September 2015|publisher=The Times of India|date=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Toledo-Vinaygar&gt;{{cite web|title=Toledo Museum of Art to Return Ganesha Sculpture to India|url=http://www.toledomuseum.org/2014/10/03/toledo-museum-of-art-to-return-ganesha-sculpture-to-india/|website=Toledo Museum of Art|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Toledo-Kapoor&gt;{{cite web|title=Kapoor Acquisitions|url=http://www.toledomuseum.org/provenance/kapoor-acquisitions/|website=Toledo Museum of Art|accessdate=30 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929163758/http://www.toledomuseum.org/provenance/kapoor-acquisitions/|archivedate=29 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, the United States returned a chola period bronze of Shivan and Parvathi, which was sold to the David Owsley Museum of Art at the [[Ball State University]] in 2005 by Subhash Kapoor. Here also, the sculpture was sold with a false provenance which placed it back to an American collection of Leo Figie, dated to 1969. lThe idol was recovered by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).&lt;ref name="Hindu-Festival"&gt;{{cite news|title=US to return stolen Chola era Shiva Parvati idol to India|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-to-return-stolen-chola-era-shiva-parvati-idol-to-india/article7899225.ece|accessdate=8 June 2016|publisher=The Hindu|date=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, the United States returned nearly 200 antiques to the Indian Government, in the presence of the visiting Prime Minister of India, [[Narendra Modi]] at Washington DC. Among the antiques returned were the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] period (850AD to 1250AD) bronze of the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] poet [[Manikkavacakar]] stolen from the Sivan Temple in Madras and the 1000 year old Sripuranthan Vinayagar which was displayed at the Toledo Museum of Art.&lt;ref name="Modi-USA-2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=US returns over 200 artifacts worth more than $100 million to India|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/us-returns-over-200-artifacts-worth-more-than-100-million-to-india-2838614/|accessdate=8 June 2016|publisher=The Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Allegory of Faith''''', also known as '''''Allegory of the Catholic Faith''''', is a painting created by Dutch artist [[Johannes Vermeer]] in about 1670–72. The painting is currently located at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, and has been since 1931.&lt;ref name=met1&gt;{{cite web |title=Vermeer's Masterpiece ''The Milkmaid''/Allegory of the Catholic Faith, about 1670–72 |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/special/vermeers_masterpiece/view_1.asp?item=10 |date= |work= |publisher= Metropolitan Museum of Art web site |accessdate=20 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This and ''[[The Art of Painting (Vermeer)|Art of Painting]]'' are his only works that fall under [[history painting]] in the contemporary [[hierarchy of genres]], though they still have his typical composition of one or two figures in a domestic interior. (''The Art of Painting'' is Vermeer's only other allegory, painted earlier than ''Allegory of Faith''.) Both share several features: the perspective is almost the same, and at the left of each painting is a multicolor [[tapestry]] pulled to the left to disclose the scene. ''The Art of Painting'' also uses symbolism from [[Cesare Ripa]] (of [[Clio]], muse of history). Vermeer's ''Love Letter'' uses the same or a similar gilt panel.&lt;ref name=akwjv/&gt; The ''Allegory'' and ''The Art of Painting'' differ markedly in style and purpose from Vermeer's other works. Both allegorical paintings show complex meaning, but ''Allegory of Faith'' "reveals that the artist's usual focus on naturalistic effects was a stylistic option, to be set aside when the subject called for another approach".&lt;ref name=met1/&gt;  ''The Art of Painting'' still reads as a naturalistic depiction of an artist and his model, and the pose of the model is simple, whereas the pose of the figure in ''The Allegory of Faith'' is [[Baroque]]ly dramatic.

==Description==
The painting depicts a woman in a fine white and blue [[satin]] dress with gold trimmings. She sits on a platform a step higher than the black and white marble floor, her right foot on a terrestrial globe and her right hand on her heart as she looks up, adoringly, at a glass sphere hung from the ceiling by a blue ribbon. Her left arm rests on the edge of a table which holds a golden chalice, a large book, and a dark-wood [[crucifix]]. Behind the crucifix is a gilt-leather panel screen.&lt;ref name=akwjv&gt;Arthur K. Wheelock Jr., editor, ''Johannes Vermeer'', catalogue of an exhibition of the same name organized by the National Gallery of Art, Washington, and the Royal Cabinet of Paintings Mauritshuis, The Hague; pp 190–195, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Beneath the book is a long piece of cloth, possibly a priest's [[Stole (vestment)|stole]].&lt;ref name=met1/&gt; Resting on top of the book is a [[crown of thorns]]. All of these items are on the platform, which is covered by a green and yellow rug, the edge of which is on the floor. At the bottom of the picture, nearer the viewer, is an apple, and nearer still a snake which has been squashed by a cornerstone. On the dim, far wall behind the woman, a large painting of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's crucifixion]] is hung on the wall behind the woman. To the viewer's left is a multicolored tapestry, pulled back at the bottom and seemingly the closest thing in the painting to the viewer.&lt;ref name=akwjv/&gt; A chair with a blue cloth on it is immediately beneath and behind the tapestry and to the left of the snake and cornerstone.

==Iconography==
[[File:Jan Vermeer - The Art of Painting - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|220px|Vermeer's ''[[The Art of Painting (Vermeer)|Art of Painting]]'']]

===From Cesare Ripa's ''Iconologia''===
Vermeer's [[iconography]] in the painting is largely taken from [[Cesare Ripa]]'s ''Iconologia'', an [[emblem book]] (a collection of allegorical illustrations with accompanying morals or poems on a moral theme) which had been translated into Dutch in 1644 by D. P. Pers. The artist used various symbols that Ripa described and illustrated in his book, along with symbols taken from other books and traditions. Two of the four allegorical figures of Faith ("Fede. Geloof" and "Fede Catholica. Catholijck of algemeen Geloof") given in Ripa's book provide many of the symbols in the painting, including the color of the woman's clothing, her hand gesture, and the presence of the crushed snake and the apple.&lt;ref name=akwjv/&gt;

In his book, Ripa states that Faith is the most important of the virtues. One image in the book shows her as a woman, dressed in white (signifying light and purity) and blue (which relates to heaven, as Ripa states in another text). Faith's hand on her breast symbolizes that the virtue rests in her heart. Christ is represented in the cornerstone crushing the snake (a symbol of the [[Christian teaching about the Devil|Devil]]), and the apple (the fruit Eve gave to Adam) represents [[original sin]],.&lt;ref name=akwjv/&gt; which in Christian doctrine required the sacrifice of the [[Jesus|Saviour]].&lt;ref name=met1/&gt; Ripa describes Faith as "having the world under her feet", and Vermeer used the symbol quite literally, showing a globe of the earth under the woman's right foot. (The globe, with its distinctive [[Cartouche (design)|cartouche]] (decorative label) has been identified as one made by [[Henricus Hondius II|Hendrick Hondius]]).&lt;ref name=akwjv/&gt;

===From other sources===
The crucifix, painting of the Crucifixion and the glass orb are not mentioned by Ripa, and Vermeer changed some of the iconography that Ripa gave: Instead of Ripa's suggestion that Faith hold the chalice and rest her hand on a book, Vermeer put them on the table next to her. According to Arthur Wheelock, a University of Maryland academic and curator of a Vermeer exhibit at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, this is "an assemblage that gives the image a Eucharistic character not found in the text." By putting the golden chalice against the dark background of the painting's frame and the dark crucifix against the gilt-leather backdrop, the elements are given a greater prominence in the painting. Wheelock, citing his fellow academic at the [[University of Maryland]], Quint Gregory, believes the slight overlapping of the chalice and the gold backdrop of the crucifix "may symbolically suggest the essential role of the Eucharist in bridging the physical and spiritual realms", a very Catholic idea.&lt;ref name=akwjv/&gt; Selena Cant calls the fact that the book, chalice and crucifix together represent the Catholic Mass.&lt;ref name=scvahw&gt;{{Cite book

| title = Vermeer and His World 1632–1675

The pose of the woman (hand on heart and eyes raised) is similar to Ripa's image of Theology. The pose was uncommon in Dutch art, but Vermeer was considered an expert in Italian painting, in which the image was often used (especially those of [[Guido Reni]] [1575–1642], whose works were then owned in Holland).&lt;ref name=akwjv/&gt; Wheelock believes the large book, which has a metal clasp, is a Bible, but the Metropolitan Museum of Art states on its website that the volume may be the Catholic [[Roman Missal|Missale Romanum]].&lt;ref name=met1/&gt;

The painting's iconography is not only Catholic, but some believe it is strongly influenced by [[Jesuit]] ideas. Departing from Ripa's allusion to the story of [[Binding of Isaac|Abraham and Isaac]] (an Old Testament story said to prefigure the faithful sacrifice of Christ on the Cross), Vermeer instead uses an image of the Crucifixion itself — an image dear to the Jesuits. Vermeer used ''Crucifixion'', a painting from about 1620 by [[Jacob Jordaens]] (1593–1678). The painter may have owned a copy of the painting.&lt;ref name=akwjv/&gt; (This may be "the large painting representing Christ on the Cross" described in an inventory of his household at his death. Two other items in the inventory may be in this painting: the "gold-tooled leather on the wall" of his home's kitchen, and an "ebony wood crucifix").&lt;ref name=scvahw/&gt;

Another Jesuit influence in the painting is said to be the glass orb on which the woman sets her eyes. According to Eddy De Johgh, Vermeer appears to have taken it from a 1636 emblem book by the Jesuit [[Willem Hesius]], ''Emblemata sacra de fide, spe, charitate''. In the emblem, "Capit Quod Non Capit", a winged boy, a symbol of the soul, is shown holding a sphere reflecting a nearby cross and the sun. In a poem accompanying the emblem, Hesius states that the sphere's ability to reflect the world is similar to the mind's ability to believe in God.&lt;ref name=ajwjv2&gt;Arthur K. Wheelock Jr., editor, ''Johannes Vermeer'', catalogue of an exhibition of the same name organized by the National Gallery of Art, Washington, and the Royal Cabinet of Paintings Mauritshuis, p 192, citing Eddy De Jongh, "Pearls of Virtue and Pearls of Vice", ''Simiolus 8: 69–97, 1975/1976, The Hague; pp 190–195, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Selena Cant has written that the sphere is "symbol of the human mind and its capacity both to reflect and to contain infinity."&lt;ref name=scvahw/&gt;

The woman's pearl necklace probably relates to pearls as ancient symbols of virginity, according to Cant. There is no source for the light on her dress, perhaps indicating that she is lit by an inner illumination&lt;ref name=scvahw/&gt; — a strong indication to the viewer that she is not to be considered an individual, but a symbol, according to [[Walter Liedtke]].&lt;ref name=wl1&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/65202/rec/17|pages=399–402|title=Vermeer and the Delft School|last=Liedtke|first=Walter A.|authorlink=Walter Liedtke|year=2001|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|isbn=9780870999734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Many art historians have considered the painting one of Vermeer's less successful works. Cant, for instance, calls it "harder, more brittle, less convincing. Faith herself appears uncomfortable: finely dressed, she appears too worldly to be a spiritual symbol, too solid to appear transported, the intimacy too forced and her expression too artificial."&lt;ref name=scvahw/&gt;

According to Wheelock, "[T]he iconographic demands of this subject strained the credibility of his realistic approach. While essential for the painting's symbolic content, the ecstatic pose of the woman and the crushed snake seem incongruous within this Dutch setting."&lt;ref name=akwjv/&gt; Walter Liedtke objected to Wheelock's point by asserting that the artist took a very realistic approach primarily in depicting the terrestrial globe and reflections in the glass sphere. Instead, according to Liedtke, the painting is best compared to contemporary Dutch paintings illustrating abstract concepts, including [[Adriaen Hanneman]]'s ''Allegory of the Peace'' (1664; still in situ at the Eerste Kamer in the Binnenhof), a histrionic picture showing how reticent Vermeer was in this work; and [[Karel Dujardin]]'s ''Allegory of the Immortal Fame of Art Vanquishing Time and Envy'' (1675; Historisches Museum, Bamberg); [[Gabriel Metsu]]'s ''The Triumph of Justice'' (late 1650s; Mauritshuis, The Hague); [[Adriaen van de Velde]]'s ''The Annunciation'' (1667; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam)as well as works by Van Honthorst and early works of De Lairesse.&lt;ref name=wl1/&gt;

==Provenance==
Vermeer's imaginative use of [[symbol]]ism in the painting indicates to Wheelock that the painter was not given specific instructions on the allegory but chose the various items himself. The original owner is unknown but may have been a Catholic in [[Delft]], possibly the Jesuits in the city.&lt;ref name=akwjv/&gt; The Metropolitan Museum of Art website states, "This late work was surely commissioned, probably by a patron who was learned as well as devout."&lt;ref name=met1/&gt;

The painting was one of those apparently not among the 21 works by the artist collection of Vermeer's main patron, Pieter Claesz van Ruijven (1624–1674), and auctioned off in the Dissius sale of 1696. Its first known owner was Herman Stoffelsz van Swoll (1632–1698), a postmaster and a Protestant. That Swoll was familiar with collecting art is indicated by the fact that the best man at his wedding in 1656 was a famous collector, [[Gerrit Reynst]]. The year after Swoll's death, in 1699, the painting was auctioned off in [[Amsterdam]] along with other works in Swoll's collection (which included Italian works). The sale catalogue described the work as "A sitting Woman with deep meanings, depicting the New Testament", and also stated, "powerfully and glowingly painted". After spending time in an unknown collection, the painting (described as "depicting the New Testament") was auctioned off in 1718, again in Amsterdam. It was auctioned again in 1735 (described as "artfully and minutely painted"), and in the Ietswaart sale of 1749 (described as "as good as [[Eglon van der Neer]]"). The mixed fortunes of Vermeer's reputation in the 18th century can be seen in the prices paid for the painting at these various auctions: ''f'' 400 in 1699; ''f''500 in 1718; ''f''53 in 1735; ''f''70 in 1749).&lt;ref name=akwjv/&gt;

By the early 19th century the painting apparently had found its way to Austria, where it was depicted in the background of ''Portrait of a Cartographer and His Wife'' by [[Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller]] in 1824 (now in [[Westfälisches Landesmuseum]], [[Münster]]). Atlases depicted in this painting contain maps primarily of [[Vorarlberg]] and [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]] at the western end of Austria, so perhaps the painting was in that area, according to Wheelock.&lt;ref name=akwjv/&gt; At the end of the century, the painting (at that time mistakenly attributed to Eglon van der Neer) was part of the collection of [[Ilya Ostroukhov]] (and later [[Dmitry Shchukin]]) in Moscow, making it the fourth Vermeer owned by Russians at that time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiorus.ru/brand/episode/id/57275/episode_id/1331851/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899 it was put up for sale by a dealer, Wächtler, in Berlin. That year [[Abraham Bredius]] bought it for about DM 700. A Dutch newspaper at the time praised Bredius for the purchase: "With this acquisition of the new Delft Vermeer, ''the New Testament'', as an Eglon van der Neer, Dr. Bredius has once again found a bargain with his perspicacious eye." Bredius then loaned the work to the [[Mauritshuis]], where it remained for the next 24 years, until 1923 when Bredius gave it to the [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]] in [[Rotterdam]] for a long-term loan.&lt;ref name=akwjv/&gt;

Bredius disliked the work, calling it (in 1907) "a large but unpleasant Vermeer". In 1928, he sold it through the dealer Kleinberger to Michael Friedsam in New York,&lt;ref name=akwjv/&gt; who bequeathed it in 1931 as part of the Friedsam Collection to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where it has remained.&lt;ref name=met1/&gt;

Barnacle was active in the [[trade unions]] from the 1860s to the 1890s. Though [[illiterate]], he had a trade as a well-skilled [[baker]]—the family line of work—and was much in demand till the end of his life. He often freelanced beyond the town in such places as [[Oughterard]].

He married Annie Honoria Healy in 1881 and they had children Mary, Nora, Bridget (known as Delia), Thomas, and Kathleen (born 1896). One other boy died in infancy, and two other daughters are known to have been born to the couple.

Thomas and Annie moved house some seven times by 1904, all in lowly working-class districts of Galway such as Newtownsmyth, Raleigh Row, and Abbeygate Street, before eventually settling at number 8 (now number 4) Bowling Green, an L-shaped street below the church of [[St. Nicholas]].

Sometime around 1896, Annie threw Thomas out of the house due to his severe drinking which had led to the loss of his bakery shop. However, he remained in demand as a [[journeyman]] baker.

While his son-in-law [[James Joyce]] (who never met him) depicted him as rough, irresponsible man, Thomas himself was very well liked by all who knew him, and was remembered very fondly by his daughter Nora. Many years later, Nora wrote to her sister Kathleen, of Joyce: ''"He's a weakling, Kathleen. I always have to be after his tail. I wish I was married to a man like my father."'' Nora Barnacle's Galway [[biographer]], Padriag Ó Laoi noted him as a genial man of five foot nine, good humored and an excellent storyteller and stated that ''"True, he took a drink, but he never disgraced his family".''

Barnacle died in 1921, having been nursed during his illness by his estranged wife, Annie.

The '''Uffington White Horse''' is a highly [[Style (visual arts)#Stylization|stylised]] [[Prehistoric Britain|prehistoric]] [[hill figure]], {{convert|110|m|ft|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="powell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powell|first1=Eric A|title=White horse of the sun|journal=Archaeology|date=Sep–Oct 2017|volume=70|issue=5|pages=9–10|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=17&amp;sid=d022d3dd-d76c-4a0c-8bda-3d22c2e5033b%40sessionmgr103|accessdate=31 August 2017|issn=0003-8113|postscript={{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Master File Complete}}}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; long, formed from deep trenches filled with crushed white [[chalk]]. The figure is situated on the upper slopes of White Horse Hill in the [[England|English]] [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] of [[Uffington, Oxfordshire|Uffington]] (in the [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of [[Oxfordshire]] and [[Historic Counties of England|historic county]] of [[Berkshire]]), some {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} south of the town of [[Faringdon]] and a similar distance west of the town of [[Wantage]]; or {{convert|2.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Uffington. The hill forms a part of the scarp of the [[Berkshire Downs]] and overlooks the [[Vale of White Horse]] to the north. The best views of the figure are obtained from the air, or from directly across the Vale, particularly around the villages of [[Great Coxwell]], [[Longcot]] and [[Fernham]]. The site is owned and managed by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] and is a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]].&lt;ref name="nhle"&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num=1008413|desc=The White Horse hill figure 170m NNE of Uffington Castle on Whitehorse Hill|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated in 2003 that "for more than 3,000 years, the Uffington White Horse has been jealously guarded as a masterpiece of [[minimalist art]]."&lt;ref name="marktownsend"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/may/04/channel4.bigbrother|title=Big Brother's logo 'defiles' White Horse|first=Mark |last=Townsend|newspaper=The Observer|date=4 May 2003|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Uffington Horse is by far the oldest of the white horse figures in Britain and is of an entirely different design from the others inspired by it.&lt;ref name=WiltshireUffington&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiltshirewhitehorses.org.uk/uffington.html|title=Wiltshire Uffington |publisher=Wiltshirewhitehorses.org.uk |date=21 March 2010 |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hows.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hows.org.uk/personal/hillfigs/uff/uffing.htm|title=Uffington White Horse|work=hows.org.uk|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[File:uffington-white-horse-1892.svg|thumb|right|Uffington White Horse, sketched by [[William Plenderleath]] in ''The White Horses of the West of England'' (1892)&lt;ref name="Plenderleath" /&gt;]]
The figure was presumed to date to "the later [[Prehistoric Britain|prehistory]]" - the [[Iron Age Britain|Iron Age]] (800 BC–AD 100) or the late [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]] (1000–700 BC). This view was generally held by scholars before the 1990s, based on the similarity of the horse's design to comparable figures in [[Celtic art]]. This theory was confirmed following a 1990 excavation led by Simon Palmer and David Miles of the Oxford Archaeological Unit: deposits of fine silt removed from the horse's 'beak' were scientifically dated to the late Bronze Age,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Darvill |first=Timothy |title=Prehistoric Britain from the Air |date=1996 |page=223 |isbn=0521551323 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/uffington-white-horse |title=Uffington White Horse |publisher=Atlas Obscura |accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometime between 1380 and 550 BC.&lt;ref name="powell" /&gt; They also discovered the figure was cut into the hill up to a metre (3&amp;nbsp;ft) deep, not simply scratched into the chalk surface.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

[[Iron Age]] coins that bear a representation comparable to the Uffington White Horse have been found, supporting the early dating of this artefact. Darvill (1996) dismisses as "folklore" the suggestion that the horse had been fashioned in the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon period]], more particularly during Alfred's reign: there is no evidence to support this.

The medieval Welsh book ''Llyfr Coch Hergest'' [The Red Book of Hergest] (1375–1425) states: ''"Gerllaw tref Abinton y mae mynydd ac eilun march arno a gwyn ydiw. Ni thyf dim arno."'' This translates as "Near to the town of Abinton there is a mountain with a figure of a stallion upon it and it is white. Nothing grows upon it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/hindex.html|title=The Red Book of Hergest|work=maryjones.us|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Until the late 19th century, the horse was scoured every seven years as part of a more general local [[fair]] held on the hill. [[Francis Wise]] wrote in 1736: "The ceremony of scouring the Horse, from time immemorial, has been solemnized by a numerous concourse of people from all the villages roundabout."&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cleaver|first1=Emily|title=Against All Odds, England's Massive Chalk Horse Has Survived 3,000 Years|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/3000-year-old-uffington-horse-looms-over-english-countryside-180963968/|accessdate=12 July 2017|publisher=Smithsonian.com|date=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If regular cleaning is halted, the figure quickly becomes obscured; it has always needed frequent work for the figure to remain visible. Periodic scouring continues, organized by the [[National Trust]]: on chalking day volunteers with hammers, buckets of chalk, and kneepads kneel and smash the chalk to a paste, whitening the paths cut in the grass inch by inch.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

During the Second World War the figure, easily recognizable from the air, was covered over with turf and hedge trimmings so that Luftwaffe pilots could not use it for navigation during bombing raids.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;
 
In August 2002 the figure was defaced with the addition of a rider and three dogs by members of the "Real Countryside Alliance" (Real CA). The act was denounced by the [[Countryside Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2220725.stm |title=White horses defaced by activists |publisher=BBC News |date=28 August 2002 |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards for a couple of days in May 2003, a temporary hill figure advertisement for [[Big Brother 4 (UK)|the fourth series]] of [[Channel 4]]'s series ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'' was controversially placed near the figure.&lt;ref name="marktownsend"/&gt; In March 2012, as part of a pre-[[Cheltenham Festival]] publicity stunt, a bookmaker added a large jockey to the figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-17297495|title=Bookmaker adds jockey to Uffington Horse|publisher=BBC News |date=9 March 2012 |accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation and meaning==
It has long been debated whether the [[chalk]] figure was intended to represent a [[White horse (mythology)|horse]] or some other animal, such as a dog or a sabre toothed cat. However, it has been called a horse since the 11th century at least. A [[cartulary]] of [[Abingdon Abbey]], compiled between 1072 and 1084, refers to ''"mons albi equi"'' at Uffington ("the White Horse Hill").&lt;ref name="Plenderleath"&gt;{{cite book |first=Rev W. C. |last=Plenderleath |authorlink=William Plenderleath |title=The White Horses of the West of England |location=London |publisher=Allen &amp; Storr |date=1892 |url=https://archive.org/stream/whitehorsesofwes00pleniala#page/8/mode/2up |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The head of the White Horse of Uffington.jpg|left|thumb|The head of the horse, with sheep grazing around it.]]
[[Image:White Horse Hill &amp; Dragon Hill c.jpg|thumb|right|White Horse Hill and [[Dragon Hill, Uffington|Dragon Hill]] (right)]]
The horse is thought to represent a tribal symbol perhaps connected with the builders of [[Uffington Castle]]. It is similar to horses depicted on [[Celtic coinage]], the currency of the pre-[[Roman Empire|Roman]]-British population, and on the Marlborough Bucket (an Iron Age burial bucket found in [[Marlborough, Wiltshire]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Early Iron Age Horses on the Marlborough Bucket |type=exhibition label |publisher=Wiltshire Museum |quote=... take a closer look at the sides of the bucket in order to identify Early Iron Age depictions of horses. They have similar features to the Uffington White Horse ... In the past, this resemblance has been used to date the Uffington Horse to the Iron Age. However, it was actually created much earlier, and does not compare exactly to Iron Age representations of horses which are often much curvier in appearance.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory proposed by [[University of Southampton]] archaeologist [[Joshua Pollard]] points to the horse's alignment with the sun, particularly in midwinter when the sun appears to overtake the horse, to indicate that it was created as a depiction of a "[[Solar deity#Solar barge and sun chariot|solar horse]]", reflecting mythological beliefs that the sun was carried across the sky on a horse or in a chariot.&lt;ref name="powell" /&gt;

==Nearby prehistoric features==
[[Image:The Manger c.jpg|thumb|The Manger, with the White Horse at centre skyline and Dragon Hill (left)]]

The most significant nearby feature is the [[Iron Age]] [[Uffington Castle]], located on higher ground atop a knoll above the White Horse.&lt;ref&gt;British Archaeology, Editor: Simon Denison, Issue no 33, April 1998 ISSN 1357-4442&lt;/ref&gt; This [[hillfort]] comprises an area of approximately {{convert|3|ha|acre}} enclosed by a single, well-preserved bank and ditch. [[Dragon Hill, Uffington|Dragon Hill]] is a natural chalk hill with an artificial flat top, associated in legend with St George.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/uffington-castle-white-horse-and-dragon-hill/|title=Uffington Castle – White Horse and Dragon Hill |publisher=English Heritage |date=16 April 2011 |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehorse Hill is designated a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI). It is a geological SSSI due to its [[Pleistocene]] sediments, and a biological SSSI as it has one of the few remaining unploughed grasslands along the chalk escarpment in Oxfordshire.&lt;ref name=citation&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1001206.pdf |title=Whitehorse Hill citation|series= Sites of Special Scientific Interest|publisher=Natural England|accessdate= 23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx?startTopic=Designations&amp;activelayer=sssiIndex&amp;query=HYPERLINK%3D%271001206%27 |title=Map of Whitehorse Hill |series= Sites of Special Scientific Interest|publisher=Natural England|accessdate= 23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The giant's stair.jpg|thumb|The Giant's Stair, taken from White Horse Hill]]
To the west are ice-cut terraces known as the "Giant's Stair".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/archaeology/white_horse.html |title=Royal Berkshire History: The Uffington White Horse |publisher=Berkshirehistory.com |date= |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe these terraces at the bottom of this valley are the result of [[medieval]] farming, or alternatively were used for early farming after being formed by natural processes. The steep sided dry valley below the horse is known as the Manger and legend says that the horse grazes there at night.

The [[Blowing Stone]], a perforated [[sarsen]] stone, lies in a garden in [[Kingston Lisle]], two kilometres away and produces a [[music]]al tone when blown through.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

[[Wayland's Smithy]] is a Neolithic [[long barrow]] and [[chamber tomb]] {{convert|1.5|mi}} southwest of the Horse.&lt;ref name="NHLE1008409"&gt;{{National Heritage List for England| num=1008409 |desc=Wayland's Smithy chambered long barrow, including an earlier barrow and Iron Age and Roman boundary ditches |grade= |accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lies next to [[The Ridgeway]], an ancient trackway that also runs behind Uffington Castle, and is followed by the Ridgeway National Trail, a long-distance footpath running from [[Overton Hill]], near [[Avebury]],  to [[Ivinghoe Beacon]] in Buckinghamshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Curtis|first=Neil|title=The Ridgeway National Trail Guide|year=1994|isbn=1-85410-268-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8831">The '''United States Society for Education through Art (USSEA)''' is an [[United States|American]] national association whose members work in curriculum development, teaching and research related to [[art education]] and [[Culture|cultural]] differences, and who share interests in [[art]] educational content and strategies which promote tolerance and appreciation of [[the arts]] of non-mainstream cultural peoples. The mission of the society is to promote greater understanding and respect for learners from all [[ethnic]], [[Minority group|minority]], and socio-cultural backgrounds through research, art curricula, instruction, and practices that are inclusive and culturally sensitive.&lt;ref name="dejong1985"&gt;DeJong, M. (Ed.) (1985). ''USSEA Handbook and Operations Manual''. Cincinnati, OH: United States Society for Education through Art. Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The society provides a platform for networking and a resource base for art educators nationally and internationally, who seek to work collaboratively on projects of interest to [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] or cross-cultural [[Community|communities]] and [[student]]s, [[Publishing|publishes]] instructional resources for [[Teacher|classroom teachers]], encourages and sponsors cross-cultural research, and facilitates international and intra-national professional relationships through online sites, [[Symposium|symposia]], [[Academic conference|conferences]], and publications.&lt;ref name="manifold2008"&gt;Manifold, M. C., Zimmerman, E. (Eds) (2008). ''USSEA Handbook and Operations Manual''. 5th edition Cincinnati, OH: United States Society for Education through Art. Page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, USSEA honors one national and one international art educator, each of whom has demonstrated exemplary teaching, service, or research in the area of multicultural or cross-cultural art education with the Ziegfeld Art Education award. The ''Journal of Cultural Research in Art Education'' is a publication of USSEA that is made available to all members of the art educational profession. Through the [[website]], members may access suggestions and recommendations for appropriate multi-culturally oriented [[K-12 (education)|K-12]] art lessons, and receive up-to-date news and information about USSEA initiatives, programs and opportunities. Additionally, exhibitions of [[Child|children's]] art from countries around the world are presented at national conferences of art educators and through an online gallery of children's art, which is organized by topical themes and maintained on the USSEA website.&lt;ref name="manifold2008" /&gt;

==History==
USSEA was founded in 1977 as an affiliate of the [[International Society for Education Through Art]] (InSEA) and the [[National Art Education Association]] (NAEA). The goals of USSEA reflect, on a national level, the goals of its international parent organization InSEA, which in turn, was inspired by the spirit of [[Aftermath of World War II|postwar]] hope and optimism of its parent affiliate [[UNESCO]]. In a paper describing the early history of InSEA, the motivational energy and overarching goals of UNESCO and InSEA are explained.

"The world had just come through a terrible and protracted [[World War II|war]], one initiated by false philosophies working on ignorance through massive control of [[Freedom of speech|free speech]]. The impulse in 1945, to try to ensure that it did not happen again, and that people should understand each other better through [[education]] and all forms of cultural and [[Science|scientific]] exchanges, the passionate emphasis on [[truth]], [[justice]], [[peace]] and the [[Individualism|importance of the individual]] – these impulses were irresistible."&lt;ref name=steers2001&gt;Steers, J. (2001). InSEA: A Brief History and a Vision of its Future Role. International Journal of Art &amp; Design Education 20 (2), 215-229.&gt;, additional text. (Hoggart quoted in Steers, 2001, p. 216)&lt;/ref&gt;

These sentiments, which gave root to InSEA in 1954, are also guiding principles of USSEA. Art educator Kenneth Marantz was instrumental in establishing the United States organization and served as its first president. Other founding members who served as officers included Maryl Fletcher De Jong, Larry Kantner, Eugenia Oole, Helen Patton, and Tom Sletterhaugh.&lt;ref name="dejong19852"&gt;De Jong, M. F. (1985). ''USSEA Handbook: Historical Record''. Cincinnati, OH: United States Society for Education through Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sponsored Activities==
As a means of disseminating shared ideas about the importance of teaching art to increasingly diverse populations and to develop research agenda for determining effective practices of multicultural art education, USSEA began sponsored conferences and symposia. Fourteen such events were held between 1977 and 2010. The topics addressed included "Limits and Extents of International Research in Art Education" (1977), "Art Education: The [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Basin" (1982), "International Aspects of Teaching [[Aesthetics]] and Critical Skills" (1987), "[[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous People]], Art, and Place: Interactions of Culture and Environment in Contemporary Life" (1994) and "Crossing Cultural, Artistic, and Cyber Borders" (2000),&lt;ref name="lapierre2000"&gt;LaPierre, S. D., Stokrocki, M., &amp; Zimmerman, E. (2000). "Research methods and methodologies for multicultural and cross-cultural issues in art education." Crossing Cultural, Artists, and Cyber Borders: Issues and Examples in Art Education Conference, (Tempe, Arizona, January 7–8, 2000). Boulder, CO: United States Society for Education through Art, additional text.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Youth and Community Development: How the Arts Serve [[Poverty|Economically Impoverished]] Communities" (2010). The 1991 USSEA Symposium, "Beyond the [[Tradition]]al in Art: Facing a Pluralistic Society," resulted in the publication of working papers and research agenda that helped focus cultural art educational research and practices during the late 20th and early 21st century.&lt;ref name="manifold2009"&gt;Manifold, M. C. (Ed.) (2009). USSEA handbook: Historical record, 5th edition. Bloomington, IN: United States Society for Education through Art. Page 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1986, USSEA has presented two annual awards in the name of Edwin Ziegfeld, founding president of InSEA (1954–1960) and NAEA (1947–1951), to honor an American art educator and a foreign art educator who have made distinguished leadership contributions to international art education. These awards are presented to the recipients during a USSEA Awards banquet held during the annual NAEA conference.&lt;ref name="ussea2007"&gt;USSEA. (2007). The Edwin Ziegfeld Awards. ''Arts &amp; Activities, 142'' (2). 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first issue of the USSEA publication ''The Journal of Multicultural and Cross-cultural Research in Art Education'' was issued in 1983 with Larry Kantner as senior editor. In 2001, the title of the journal was changed to the ''Journal of Cultural Research in Art Education'' (JCRAE). Articles published in JCRAE focus on social/cultural research relevant for art education, including cultural foundations of art education, cross-cultural and multicultural research in art education, and cultural aspects of art in education. These areas may be interpreted in a broad sense to include arts administration, [[art therapy]], community arts organizations, and other disciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches relevant to art education. Articles considered for publication may feature theoretical research and research in which qualitative and/or quantitative methods as well as other formats and strategies are employed. In addition to the publication of a [[Magazine|journal]], USSEA sponsors [[monograph]]s and sponsors or endorses books that address issues of interest and concern to art educators.&lt;ref name="jcrae"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ussea.sdstate.org/AboutJCRAE.htm|title=Journal of Cultural Studies in Art Education|work=Official site|publisher=USSEA|accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan External Trade Organisation ([[JETRO]]) was designated as the partner organization. Japan also reciprocated Gujarat’s initiatives for mutual economic cooperation by sending two senior level delegations, led by Hideaki Domichi, the Ambassador of Japan to India and [[Heizo Takenaka]], Former Minister of Economic &amp; [[Fiscal policy|Fiscal Policy]] of Japan. The maximum number of delegates was from Japan, totalling to over 70 members. Another major delegation was from USA.

The exhibition was organized in a grand way, spread over an area of 19,200 sq. mts. There were 232 stalls, quite impressive and informative, having participation of eminent companies of India. Sixteen countries participated in the exhibition from countries such as Japan, Korea, UK, Kenya, [[Arab League]], Russia, Netherlands, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, [[Czech Republic]], [[El Salvador]] and Uganda.

Earlier Summits were organized in the year 2003, 2005 and 2007. The 2003 Global Investors' Summit was held coinciding with the glorious Navratri festival where a total of 76 MoUs worth USD 14 billion were signed. The 2005 Summit saw signing of 226 MoUs garnering an investment of USD 20 billion. The year 2007 Summit, resulted in signing of 675 MoUs worth USD 152 billion. In the year 2009, the initiative that began six years ago, was intensified and the state propelled into the next stage of the development process, focused and intensive growth in the [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] index.

==2015==
The 7th Vibrant Gujarat Summit  was planned during 11 to 13 January 2015 at [[Mahatma Mandir]], [[Gandhinagar]], [[Gujarat]], India. Six summits held so far had been a resounding success and immensely contributed to the transformation of Gujarat into a "Global Business Hub". The prime focus of Government of Gujarat was Inclusive development and the key areas for development identified included: Innovation, Sustainability, Youth &amp; Skill Development, Knowledge Sharing and Networking. This Summit was an ideal platform for other states and countries to showcase their strengths, highlight business opportunities, facilitate knowledge dissemination etc.

Apart from Summit, Vibrant Gujarat is also known for the Trade Shows. Every year 2000+ Companies do participate in this exhibition, and around 1 million visitors participated in Vibrant Gujarat 2015.

'''Videoart at Midnight''' is an international forum fostering [[contemporary art]], in particular [[film]], [[new media art]] and [[video art]]. In a monthly program international artists are invited to show their work in the big cinema hall of the [[Kino Babylon]] in the [[Mitte (locality)|Mitte]] neighborhood of [[Berlin]].

== Background ==
''Videoart at Midnight'' is a private initiative, founded in 2008 by Olaf Stüber and organized since then together with Ivo Wessel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mutualart/your-passport-to-video-ar_b_4781107.html/ Your Passport to Video Art Around the World] on: The Huffington Post, April 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exberliner.com/culture/art/video-art-at-midnight/ Davies-Crook, Susanna: "We force our audience a little bit"] on: EXBERLINER, April 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/arts-ideas/stay-up-late-drafting-a-midnight-manifesto-9a1754f08213/ Stay Up Late! Towards a Midnight Manifesto] on: ARTS &amp; IDEAS, Oct 17, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Once a month on a Friday always at midnight the two art proponents invite artists to show their works within in the "[[Dispositif]] cinema" to put them up for discourse. Every night is dedicated to one artist. The artist is present. It is often the occasion for a premiere of a video work, sometimes accompanied by live acts, such as performances, concerts, lectures or artist talks.&lt;ref name =":4"&gt;[https://blog.artconnect.com/2013/11/08/berlin-premiere-the-lost-by-reynolds-reynolds/ Anastasia Trinh: Berlin Premiere: THE LOST by Reynold Reynolds] on: artconnect, November 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;[http://www.degem.de/berlin-miss-moth-chris-newman-seth-josel-bill-dietz-in-berlin-2/ Bill Dietz: Berlin – MISS MOTH (Chris Newman, Seth Josel, Bill Dietz) in Berlin] on: Deutsche Gesellschaft für Elektroakustische Musik e.V., October 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The aim of the screening series is to offer a forum for Berlin's international art scene and to give an insight into an artist media that is gaining an increasing importance within the contemporary art production.&lt;ref&gt;Balsom, Erika: Exhibiting Cinema In Contemporary Art. 1st ed.

[[File:Light dispersion of a mercury-vapor lamp with a flint glass prism IPNr°0125.jpg|thumb|White [[light]] is [[dispersion (optics)|dispersed]] by a [[triangular prism (optics)|prism]] into the colors of the visible spectrum.]]

The '''visible spectrum''' is the portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] that is [[visual perception|visible]] to the [[human eye]]. [[Electromagnetic radiation]] in this range of [[wavelength]]s is called '''visible light''' or simply [[light]]. A typical [[human eye]] will respond to wavelengths from about 380 to 700 [[nanometers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Biology: Concepts and Applications | author = Starr, Cecie | publisher = Thomson Brooks/Cole | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-534-46226-0 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=RtSpGV_Pl_0C&amp;pg=PA94}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of frequency, this corresponds to a band in the vicinity of 430–770 [[Hertz#SI prefixed forms of hertz|THz]].

The spectrum does not contain all the [[color]]s that the human eyes and brain can distinguish. [[Excitation purity|Unsaturated colors]] such as [[pink]], or [[purple]] variations like [[magenta]], for example, are absent because they can only be made from a mix of multiple wavelengths. Colors containing only one wavelength are also called [[Excitation purity|pure colors]] or spectral colors.

Visible wavelengths pass largely unattenuated through the [[Earth's atmosphere]] via the "[[optical window]]" region of the electromagnetic spectrum. An example of this phenomenon is when clean air [[scattering|scatters]] blue light more than red light, and so the midday sky appears blue. The optical window is also referred to as the "visible window" because it overlaps the human visible response spectrum. The [[near infrared]] (NIR) window lies just out of the human vision, as well as the medium wavelength infrared (MWIR) window, and the long wavelength or far infrared (LWIR or FIR) window, although other animals may experience them.

==History==
[[File:Newton's color circle.png|thumb|Newton's color circle, from ''Opticks'' of 1704, showing the colors he associated with [[musical note]]s. The spectral colors from red to violet are divided by the notes of the musical scale, starting at D. The circle completes a full [[octave]], from D to D. Newton's circle places red, at one end of the spectrum, next to violet, at the other. This reflects the fact that non-spectral [[purple]] colors are observed when red and violet light are mixed.]]

In the 13th century, [[Roger Bacon]] theorized that [[rainbow]]s were produced by a similar process to the passage of light through glass or crystal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=j8BCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=%22roger+bacon%22+prism|title=The Science of Logic: An Inquiry Into the Principles of Accurate Thought |first=Peter|last=Coffey|year=1912|publisher=Longmans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, [[Isaac Newton]] discovered that prisms could disassemble and reassemble white light, and described the phenomenon in his book ''[[Opticks]]''. He was the first to use the word ''spectrum'' ([[Latin]] for "appearance" or "apparition") in this sense in print in 1671 in describing his [[experiment]]s in [[optics]]. Newton observed that, when a narrow beam of [[sunlight]] strikes the face of a glass [[Dispersive prism|prism]] at an angle, some is [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] and some of the beam passes into and through the glass, emerging as different-colored bands. Newton hypothesized light to be made up of "corpuscles" (particles) of different colors, with the different colors of light moving at different speeds in transparent matter, red light moving more quickly than violet in glass. The result is that red light is bent ([[refraction|refracted]]) less sharply than violet as it passes through the prism, creating a spectrum of colors.

[[File:Newton prismatic colours.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Newton's observation of prismatic colors ([[David Brewster]] 1855)]] Newton divided the spectrum into seven named colors: [[red]], [[Orange (color)|orange]], [[yellow]], [[green]], [[blue]], [[indigo]], and [[Violet (color)|violet]]. He chose seven colors out of a belief, derived from the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Sophism|sophists]], of there being a connection between the colors, the musical notes, the known objects in the [[solar system]], and the days of the week.&lt;ref name="Isacoff2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Isacoff|first=Stuart|title=Temperament: How Music Became a Battleground for the Great Minds of Western Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kasFeTRcf4C&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=18 March 2014|date=16 January 2009|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-56051-3|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human eye is relatively insensitive to indigo's frequencies, and some people who have otherwise-good vision cannot distinguish indigo from blue and violet. For this reason, some later commentators, including [[Isaac Asimov]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=Eyes on the universe : a history of the telescope|year=1975|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-395-20716-1|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that indigo should not be regarded as a color in its own right but merely as a shade of blue or violet. However, the evidence indicates that what Newton meant by "indigo" and "blue" does not correspond to the modern meanings of those color words. Comparing Newton's observation of prismatic colors to a color image of the visible light spectrum shows that "indigo" corresponds to what is today called blue, whereas "blue" corresponds to [[cyan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Ralph M.|title=The perception of color|year=1974|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-24785-2|edition=null}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLaren|first=K.|title=Newton's indigo|journal=Color Research &amp; Application|date=March 2007|volume=10|issue=4|pages=225–229|doi=10.1002/col.5080100411}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldman|first=Gary|title=Introduction to light : the physics of light, vision, and color|year=2002|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola|isbn=978-0-486-42118-6|pages=193|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PbsoAXWbnr4C&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=Newton+color+Indigo#v=onepage&amp;q=Newton%20color%20Indigo&amp;f=false|edition=Dover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe|Goethe]] wrote about optical spectra in his ''[[Theory of Colours (book)|Theory of Colours]]''. Goethe used the word ''spectrum'' (''Spektrum'') to designate a ghostly optical [[afterimage]], as did [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] in ''[[On Vision and Colors]]''. Goethe argued that the continuous spectrum was a compound phenomenon. Where Newton narrowed the beam of light to isolate the phenomenon, Goethe observed that a wider aperture produces not a spectrum but rather reddish-yellow and blue-cyan edges with [[white]] between them. The spectrum appears only when these edges are close enough to overlap.

In the early 19th century, the concept of the visible spectrum became more definite, as light outside the visible range was discovered and characterized by [[William Herschel]] ([[infrared]]) and [[Johann Wilhelm Ritter]] ([[ultraviolet]]), [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The connection between the visible spectrum and [[color vision]] was explored by Thomas Young and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] in the early 19th century. Their [[Young–Helmholtz theory|theory of color vision]] correctly proposed that the eye uses three distinct receptors to perceive color.

Many species can see light within frequencies outside the human "visible spectrum". [[Bee]]s and many other insects can detect ultraviolet light, which helps them find [[nectar (plant)|nectar]] in flowers. Plant species that depend on insect pollination may owe reproductive success to their appearance in ultraviolet light rather than how colorful they appear to humans. Birds, too, can see into the ultraviolet (300–400&amp;nbsp;nm), and some have sex-dependent markings on their plumage that are visible only in the ultraviolet range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuthill|first=Innes C |authorlink=Innes Cuthill |editor=Peter J.B.

Colors that can be produced by visible light of a narrow band of wavelengths (monochromatic light) are called [[Spectral color|pure spectral colors]]. The various color ranges indicated in the illustration are an approximation: The spectrum is continuous, with no clear boundaries between one color and the next.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno, Thomas J. and Svoronos, Paris D. N. (2005). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FgjHjhCh5wsC&amp;pg=PP1 CRC Handbook of Fundamental Spectroscopic Correlation Charts.]'' CRC Press. {{ISBN|9781420037685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rendered Spectrum.png|thumb|left|upright=1.75|A rendering of the visible spectrum on a gray background produces non-spectral mixtures of pure spectrum with gray, which fit into the [[sRGB]] color space.]]
Color displays (e.g. [[computer monitor]]s and [[television]]s) cannot reproduce [[color vision|''all'' colors discernible by a human eye]]. Colors outside the color [[gamut]] of the device, such as most [[spectral color]]s, can only be [[approximation|approximated]]. For color-accurate reproduction, a spectrum can be projected onto a uniform [[gray (color)|gray]] field. The resulting [[additive color|mixed colors]] can have all their [[RGB color model|R, G, B coordinates]] non-negative, and so can be reproduced without distortion. This accurately simulates looking at a spectrum on a gray background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/repspec/|title=Reproducing Visible Spectra|website=RepairFAQ.org|accessdate=2011-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spectroscopy]] is the study of objects based on the spectrum of color they emit, absorb or reflect. Spectroscopy is an important investigative tool in [[astronomy]], where scientists use it to analyze the properties of distant objects. Typically, [[astronomical spectroscopy]] uses high-dispersion [[diffraction grating]]s to observe spectra at very high spectral resolutions. [[Helium]] was first detected by analysis of the spectrum of the [[sun]]. [[Chemical element]]s can be detected in astronomical objects by [[emission line]]s and [[absorption line]]s.

The shifting of spectral lines can be used to measure the [[Doppler shift]] ([[red shift]] or [[blue shift]]) of distant objects.
