'''Aline Bernstein Saarinen''' (March 25, 1914 – July 13, 1972) was a well-known critic of art and architecture in the United States, an author and a television journalist.

==Birth and education==
Aline Bernstein was born on March 25, 1914 in New York City, the daughter of Irma (Lewyn) and Allen Milton Bernstein, both of German Jewish descent.&lt;ref&gt;http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/saarinen-aline-bernstein&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-2591308157/saarinen-aline-19141972.html&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was the head of an investment firm and an amateur painter. Her mother also painted, and she was encouraged to take an interest in the arts. She graduated in 1931 from the Ethical Culture Fieldston School in Riverdale, the Bronx, New York, then went to [[Vassar College]] where she studied art and developed an interest in journalism. She graduated in 1935 with an A.B. degree.&lt;ref name=Brody2006/&gt;

==Art critic==

On 17 June 1935 Aline married Joseph H. Louchheim, a public welfare administrator. The same year she enrolled at [[New York University]]'s Institute of Fine Arts to study the History of Architecture, graduating with an A.M. degree in 1941. She had two sons during this period, Donald in 1937, and Harry in 1939.
Aline obtained a job with ''[[ARTnews|Art News]]'' magazine in 1944, becoming managing editor from 1946 to 1948. From 1948 to 1953 she was associate art editor and critic at the ''[[New York Times]]'', and published articles on art and cultural trends in various magazines.&lt;ref name=Brody2006/&gt;

Aline divorced Joseph Louchheim in 1951.&lt;ref name=Brody2006/&gt; In January 1953 she went to Detroit to interview the Finnish-born architect [[Eero Saarinen]], who had recently been acclaimed for his [[General Motors Technical Center]]. They were attracted to each other at once. Her profile of Saarinen, titled ''Now Saarinen the Son'', appeared in the ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'' on 23 April 1953.&lt;ref name=Lange2009/&gt; She married Saarinen in 1954, moving to [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan]], where his firm had its headquarters.&lt;ref name=Lange2009/&gt;

After their marriage, Aline stopped writing on architecture due to potential conflict of interest.&lt;ref name=Lange2009/&gt; She continued writing for the ''Times'' as an associate art critic, now using the byline Aline B. Saarinen.&lt;ref name=Sicherman1980/&gt; She became "Head of Information Service" at Eero Saarinen &amp; Associates, a job that included bringing her husband's work to the attention of magazine editors with whom she had once worked.&lt;ref name=Lange2009/&gt;
In December that year they had a son, Eames.&lt;ref name=AAAbio/&gt; In 1957 Aline was awarded a [[Guggenheim fellowship]] with which she wrote the best selling book ''The Proud Possessors'', a collection of biographies of American art collectors.&lt;ref name=Brody2006/&gt; Eero died suddenly in 1961. Aline stayed with the firm while unfinished projects were completed, and in 1962 edited the book ''Eero Saarinen on His Work''.&lt;ref name=AAAbio/&gt;

==Television==

In 1962, Saarinen first appeared on television, discussing art. The show was successful, leading to demand for more appearances. In the fall of 1963 she became art and architecture editor for [[NBC]]'s ''Sunday'' show, and art critic for their ''Today'' show. She discussed a broad range of topics with a lively and original style. She also made many specials and documentaries, including ''The Art of Collecting'', which aired in January 1964. In October 1964 she became a correspondent for NBC News, the third NBC woman reporter after [[Pauline Frederick (journalist)|Pauline Frederick]] and [[Nancy Dickerson]]. Again, she covered a broad range of subjects.&lt;ref name=Sicherman1980/&gt;

Aline was moderator on the show ''For Women Only'', in which a panel answered questions from the audience including ones on subjects such as birth control and abortion.&lt;ref name=Sicherman1980/&gt; During the 1960s Aline also served on the Design Advisory Committee of the Federal Aviation Administration, the [[U.S. Commission of Fine Arts]] from 1963 to 1971, and the New York State Council of the Arts.&lt;ref name=AAAbio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Luebke, ed., ''Civic Art:  A Centennial History of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts'' (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, 2013):  Appendix B, p. 554.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1971 she was made head of NBC's Paris News Bureau, holding this position until her death from a brain tumor on 13 July 1972.&lt;ref name=Brody2006/&gt; In 1970, Saarinen prepared a one-hour [[NBC]] program in celebration of the [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial|Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.org/digital_files/archives/Trescher_Centennial_records_b18234550.pdf Finding aid for the George Trescher records related to The Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial, 1949, 1960-1971 (bulk 1967-1970)]. [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Retrieved 8 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==

Aline Saarinen was given the International Award for Best Foreign Criticism at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1951. She received the [[Frank Jewett Mather]] Award for best newspaper art criticism in 1953, and the [[American Federation of Arts]] Award for best newspaper criticism in 1956.&lt;ref name=AAAbio/&gt; In 1964 she turned down an offer from President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] of the post of ambassador to Finland.&lt;ref name=Sicherman1980/&gt; Aline was awarded an honorary degree by the [[University of Michigan]] in 1964, and another by the [[Russell Sage College]] in 1967.&lt;ref name=AAAbio/&gt;

'''Audleystown Court Cairn''' is a [[Court cairn|dual court grave]] situated near the south shore of [[Strangford Lough]], north-west of [[Castle Ward]], 1.75 miles from [[Strangford]] village in [[County Down]], [[Northern Ireland]], at grid ref: 562 504).&lt;ref name="DOE"&gt;{{cite book | last=Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland| year=1983 |title=Historic Monuments of Northern Ireland | publisher=HMSO | location=Belfast | pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contained human and animal remains, as well as pottery and flint implements.

==Features==
It is a, now roofless, trapezoidal long cairn, with the sides revetted by dry-stone walling almost 27m long&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Weir, A| year=1980 |title=Early Ireland. A Field Guide | publisher=Blackstaff Press | location=Belfast | pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a shallow forecourt at each end opening into a burial gallery of four chambers.&lt;ref name="DOE"/&gt; The cairn material of local stone, survives to a height of 2–3&amp;nbsp;ft and was probably originally filled sufficiently highly to cover the heavy flags which roofed the burial galleries.&lt;ref name="DD"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Donnelly, JP  |author2=Donnelly, MM |lastauthoramp=yes | year=1980 |title=Downpatrick and Lecale. A Short Historical Guide | pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic unit of a forecourt giving access to a gallery divided into four burial chambers is repeated at each end of the long, wedge-shaped mound, so that the two individual units almost, but not quite, meet back to back near the centre of the mound.&lt;ref name="HA"&gt;{{cite book | last=Harbinson, P| year=1992 |title=Guide to National and Historic Monuments of Ireland | publisher=Gill and Macmillan | location=Dublin | pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an intervening gap of just over 2m. Traces of at least partial [[corbel]]ling of the galleries was found. The galleries are each about 10m in length, 1.2m in width and about 1.2 to 1.5m high.&lt;ref name="WA"&gt;{{cite book | last=Waddell, J| year=2000 |title=The Prehistoric Archaeology of Ireland | publisher=Wordwell | location=Bray | pages=83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The dual court grave was discovered in 1946 by a farmer.&lt;ref name="DOE"/&gt;

==Excavations==
The site was excavated in 1952 by AEP (Pat) Collins of the Archaeological Survey.&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mallory, JP  |author2=McNeill, TE |lastauthoramp=yes | year=1991 |title=the Archaeology of Ulster from Colonization to Plantation | publisher=Institute of Irish Studies, QUB | location=Belfast | pages=60 and 96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The burial deposits included human bones and teeth, mammal bones, artefacts, burnt earth and charcoal. At least 34 individuals of both sexes and all ages were identified, with 17 in each gallery.&lt;ref name="DD"/&gt; In the northeast gallery the remains of ten individuals were found in the chamber and another seven in the second chamber, but there were no bones or grave goods in the third and fourth chambers.&lt;ref name="MM"/&gt; All the remains were disarticulated in such a way as to suggest that they must have been defleshed before being put in the tomb, and some were burned.&lt;ref name="HA"/&gt; Over 20 of the sets of bones were unburnt and had been placed in a defleshed condition, sometimes in small neatly arranged groups, at all levels in the burial deposits, which contained burnt bone throughout.&lt;ref name="WA"/&gt; At least 15 pottery vessels, reduced to fragments by roof collapse, were identified. Some were decorated, but most were plain Western Neolithic carinated bowls. Worked [[flint]] found included a large [[Javelin (weapon)|javelin]] head and 12 lozenge-shaped arrowheads, as well as a number of scrappers and knives.&lt;ref name="DD"/&gt; Two of the bowls found are exceptional in having lugs like vessels found in some tombs in [[Scotland]]. Fingertip fluting on three bowls makes them similar to bowls found in Scotland and the [[Isle of Man]]. The animal bones found included ox, sheep, goats, pig and dog or wolf, as well as bird bones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Herity, M  |author2=Eogan, G |lastauthoramp=yes | year=1977 |title=Ireland in Prehistory | publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul | location=London | pages=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a food vessel and a horse bone found in one of the chambers.&lt;ref name="MM"/&gt;

'''''Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco''''' is a book about the [[leveraged buyout]] (LBO) of [[RJR Nabisco]], written by [[investigative journalism|investigative journalists]] [[Bryan Burrough]] and [[John Helyar]]. The book is based upon a series of articles written by the authors for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}. The book was later made into a [[made-for-TV movie]] by [[Home Box Office|HBO]], also called ''[[Barbarians at the Gate (film)|Barbarians at the Gate]]''. The book centers on [[F. Ross Johnson]], the [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]] of RJR Nabisco, who planned to buy out the rest of the Nabisco [[shareholder]]s.

==Summary==
Those opposed to Johnson's bid for the company, [[Henry Kravis]] and his cousin [[George R. Roberts]], were among the pioneers of the [[leveraged buyout]] (LBO). Kravis was the first person Johnson talked to about doing the LBO and feels betrayed after learning that Johnson wants to do the deal with another firm, [[American Express]]'s former [[Lehman Brothers|Shearson Lehman Hutton]] division. [[Theodore J. Forstmann|Ted Forstmann]] and his [[Forstmann Little &amp; Company|Forstmann Little]] buyout firm also played a prominent role.

After Kravis and Johnson are unable to reconcile their differences, a bidding war takes place which Johnson will eventually lose. The unfortunate side effect of the augmented buyout price to the shareholders is the creation of a worrying level of [[debt]] for the company.

The title of the book comes from a statement by Forstmann, in which he calls Kravis' money "phoney [[junk bond]] crap" and declares him and his cousin as "real people with real money," also stating that to stop raiders like Kravis: "We need to push the barbarians back from the city gates."

Friedman spoke with the authors about the two-decade history of the book and of their ensuing careers (the two undertook no further joint projects).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/barbarians-gate-authors-reflect-wall/story.aspx?guid={96E5F741-4FA2-4D8B-97F2-493F07358505}&amp;dist=msr_15 "'Barbarians at the Gate' authors reflect"] by Jon Friedman, ''MarketWatch'', 11-21-08. Retrieved 2-7-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Business reporter [[Andrew Ross Sorkin]] of ''The New York Times'' wrote in his book ''[[Too Big to Fail (book)|Too Big to Fail]]'' that this is his favourite business book of all time.

'''Body painting''' is a form of [[body art]] where artwork is painted directly onto the human [[skin]]. Unlike [[tattoo]]s and other forms of body art, body painting is temporary, lasting several hours or sometimes up to a few weeks (in the case of [[mehndi]] or "henna tattoos" about two weeks). Body painting that is limited to the [[face]] is known as "[[face painting]]". Body painting is also referred to as (a form of) "temporary tattoo". Large scale or full-body painting is more commonly referred to as body painting, while smaller or more detailed work can sometimes be referred to as temporary tattoos.

==Indigenous==
[[File:George_Catlin_005.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Indigenous body painting]]
Body painting with [[clay]] and other natural [[pigment]]s existed in most, if not all, [[tribe|tribalist]] cultures. Often worn during ceremonies, it still survives in this ancient form among the indigenous people of [[Indigenous Australians|Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[Pacific islands]] and parts of [[Africa]]. A semi-permanent form of body painting known as ''[[Mehndi]]'', using dyes made of [[henna|henna leaves]] (hence also known rather erroneously as "henna tattoo"), is practiced in [[India]], especially on [[bride]]s. Since the late 1990s, Mehndi has become popular amongst young [[women]] in the Western world.

Many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] of Central and South America paint [[jagua tattoo]]s, or designs with ''[[Genipa americana]]'' juice on their bodies. [[Indigenous peoples of South America]] traditionally use [[annatto]], [[huito]], or wet [[charcoal]] to decorate their faces and bodies. Huito is semi-permanent, and it generally takes weeks for this black dye to fade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Dinhora |last=Montañez R |title=Body painting, el arte de la poesía corporal: Sobre el trabajo de Mao Mix R |year=2013 |location=Neiva|editor=Diario del Huila}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Body painting is not always large pieces on fully nude bodies, but can involve smaller pieces on displayed areas of otherwise clothed bodies. There has been a revival of body painting in Western society since the 1960s, in part prompted by the liberalization of [[social mores]] regarding [[nudity]] and often comes in [[sensationalist]] or [[exhibitionist]] forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/painting/body.htm |title=Body Painting: History, Origins, Types, Methods, Festivals: Tribal Art |publisher=Visual-arts-cork.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even today there is a constant debate about the legitimacy of body painting as an art form. The current modern revival could be said to date back to the [[Century of Progress|1933 World's Fair]] in Chicago when [[Max Factor, Sr.]] and his [[model (person)|model]] [[Sally Rand]] were arrested for causing a public disturbance when he body-painted her with his new make-up formulated for [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Basten |first=Fred E. |authorlink= |title=Max Factor: The Man Who Changed the Faces of the World |publisher=Arcade Publishing |year=2012 |location=New York |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MdMEEze2sHIC&amp;printsec=frontcover |isbn=978-1-61145-135-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Body art today evolves to the works more directed towards personal [[mythologies]], as [[Jana Sterbak]], [[Rebecca Horn]], [[Youri Messen-Jaschin]], [[Jacob Alexander Figueroa]] or Javier Perez.

Body painting is sometimes used as a method of gaining attention in political protests, for instance those by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] against [[Burberry]].

Body painting led to a minor alternative art movement in the 1950s and 1960s, which involved covering a model in paint and then having the model touch or roll on a canvas or other medium to transfer the paint. French artist [[Yves Klein]] is perhaps the most famous for this, with his series of paintings "Anthropometries". The effect produced by this technique creates an image-transfer from the model's body to the medium. This includes all the curves of the model's body (typically female) being reflected in the outline of the image. This technique was not necessarily monotone; multiple colors on different body parts sometimes produced interesting effects.

[[Joanne Gair]] is a body paint artist whose work appeared for the tenth consecutive year in the 2008 ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]''. She came to prominence with an August 1992 ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' ''[[Demi's Birthday Suit]]'' cover of [[Demi Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photoimpactonline.com/gair.htm |title=Make-Up Illusion by Joanne Gair |accessdate=2008-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221204220/http://www.photoimpactonline.com/gair.htm |archivedate=2007-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mocoloco.com/art/archives/004340.php |title=Body Painting: Masterpieces by Joanne Gair |work=Art MOCO: The Modern and Contemporary Art Blog |accessdate=2008-02-18 |date=2007-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205095055/http://mocoloco.com/art/archives/004340.php |archivedate=2008-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her ''[[Disappearing Model]]'' was part of an episode of ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]''.&lt;ref name="JGTAoI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joannegair.com/about.htm |title=Joanne Gair: The Art of Illusion |accessdate=2009-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Festivals===
[[File:FantasyFest1-35.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|An artist body painting at [[Fantasy Fest]]]]

Body painting festivals happen annually across the world, bringing together professional body painters and keen amateurs. Body painting can also be seen at some [[football]] matches, at [[rave party|rave parties]], and at certain [[festival]]s. The [[World Bodypainting Festival]] is a three-day festival which originated in 1998 and which has been held in [[Klagenfurt]], [[Austria]] since 2017. Participants attend from over fifty countries and the event has more than 20,000 visitors.

Body painting festivals that take place in North America include the North American Body Painting Championship, Face and Body Art International Convention in [[Orlando, Florida]], Bodygras Body Painting Competition in [[Nanaimo, BC]] and the Face Painting and Body Art Convention in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].

Australia also has a number of body painting festivals, most notably the annual Australian Body Art Festival in [[Eumundi, Queensland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Body Art Festival|url=http://australianbodyart.com.au/|website=Australian Body Art Festival|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Australian Body Art Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Body Art Awards|url=http://www.australianbodyartawards.com.au/|website=Australian Body Art Awards|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, the [[Rabarama Skin Art Festival]] (held every year during the Summer and Autumn, with a tour in the major Italian cities), is a different event focused on the artistic side of body painting, highlighting the emotional impact of the painted body in a live performance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlLGBeKZbj4&amp;index=19&amp;list=PLH5mzQMbZVTqYSHVXFJE7n7jJ_Vpl4pP9&amp;t=17s|title=Finale 2016 del Rabarama Skin Art Festival, video TG|first=|last=Kryolan Italia|date=4 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than the decorative and technical aspects of it. This particular form of creative art is known as "Skin Art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabaramaskinartfestival.com/skin-art-manifesto|title=Rabarama Skin Art: body painting d'arte festival in Italia|author=|date=|work=rabaramaskinartfestival.com|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fine art===

The 1960s supermodel [[Veruschka]] is a much appreciated muse for bodypaint artists. Images of her in the book ''Transfigurations'' by photographer [[Holger Trulzsch]] have frequently been emulated.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Other well-known works include [[Serge Diakonoff]]'s books ''A Fleur de Peau''{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} and ''Diakonoff'' and [[Joanne Gair]]'s ''Paint a licious''. More recently Dutch art photographer [[Karl Hammer]] has taken center stage with his combinations of body painting and narrative art ([[fantastic realism]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Following the already established trend in Western-Europe, body painting has become more widely accepted in the United States since the early 1990s. In 2006 the first gallery dedicated exclusively to fine art body painting was opened in New Orleans by World Bodypainting Festival Champion and Judge, Craig Tracy. The [[Painted Alive Gallery]] is on Royal Street in the [[French Quarter]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} In 2009, a popular late night talk show ''Last Call with Carson Daly'' on NBC network, featured a New York-based artist Danny Setiawan who creates reproductions of masterpieces by famous artists such as [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], and [[Gustav Klimt]] on human bodies aiming to make fine art appealing for his contemporaries who normally would not consider themselves as art enthusiasts.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Since 2005 the Australian visual artist [[Emma Hack]] has been creating photographs of painted naked human bodies that visually merge with a patterned background wall inspired by the wallpaper designs of [[Florence Broadhurst]]. Hack is best known for the [[Gotye]] music video for the song ''[[Somebody That I Used to Know]]'', which uses [[stop-motion]] animation body painting and has received over 800 million views on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Debbie|last=Cuthbertson|title=Adelaide artist Emma Hack breathes new life into Florence Broadhurst archive|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=17 January 2014|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/adelaide-artist-emma-hack-breathes-new-life-into-florence-broadhurst-archive-20140116-30xlt.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hack now creates her own canvas backgrounds and her work is often featured with live birds, representing nature.  Hack's artworks are exhibited worldwide.

===In the commercial arena===
Many artists work professionally as body painters for television commercials, such as the Natrel Plus campaign featuring models camouflaged as trees. Stills advertising also used body painting with hundreds of body painting looks on the pages of the world's magazines every year. Body painters also work frequently in the film arena especially in science fiction with an increasing number of elaborate alien creations being body painted.

[[Syl Verberk]] (nicknamed "syllie faces") is a commercial body paint artist who, as a two-time European champion and winner of various prizes, is frequently consulted by major companies and theme parks for their advertisements and designs. Other celebrated commercial artists are [[Guido Daniele]], [[Jean-Paul Bourdier]] and the Australian company "Human Statue Bodyart".

The ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]'', published annually, has frequently featured a section of models that were body painted, attired in renditions of swimsuits or sports jerseys. Also ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine has frequently made use of body painted models. In the 2005 ''Playmates at Play at the Playboy Mansion'' calendar, all [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate]]s appeared in the calendar wearing bikinis, but Playmates [[Karen McDougal]] and [[Hiromi Oshima]] actually appeared in painted-on bikinis for their respective months.

The success of body painting has led to many notable international competitions and a specific trade magazine (''Illusion Magazine'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://illusionmagazine.co.uk/illusion-magazine|title=Illusion Magazine|author=|date=|work=illusionmagazine.co.uk|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for this industry, showcasing work around the world.

==Face painting==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2012}}
[[File:MochePaintedFace.jpg|thumb|right|Moche ceramic vessel at the [[Larco Museum]] in [[Lima]], depicting a man, possibly a warrior, with face painting]]
Face painting is the artistic application of cosmetic "paint" to a person's face. From ancient times, it has been used for [[hunting]], [[religion|religious reasons]], and [[military]] reasons (such as [[camouflage]] and to indicate membership in a military unit).

In some forms of [[folk dance]], such as [[Border Morris]], the faces of the dancers are painted with a black [[pigment]] in a tradition that goes back to the [[Middle Ages]]. In the 18th century [[cosmetics|cosmetic]] face painting became popular with men and women of the aristocracy and the [[nouveau riche]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Makeup And Lead Poisoning In The 18th Century|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums-static/objectretrieval/node/111|publisher=University College London|author=Emma Chambers|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it died out in Western culture after the fall of the French aristocracy. During the 19th century [[blackface]] theatrical makeup gained popularity when it was used by non-black performers to represent [[black people]], typically in a minstrel show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William John|last=Mahar|title=Behind the Burnt Cork Mask: Early Blackface Minstrelsy and Antebellum American Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=orsJVN4dhLsC|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1999|page=9|isbn=0-252-06696-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use ended in the United States with the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D5cVSVbOu2EC|first=Frank W.|last=Sweet|title=A History of the Minstrel Show|publisher=Boxes &amp; Arrows|year=2000|page=25|isbn=9780939479214}}&lt;/ref&gt; at about the same time that face painting re-entered the popular culture as part of the [[hippie]] movement of the late 1960s, when it was common for young women to decorate their cheeks with flowers or [[peace symbols]] at anti-war demonstrations.

[[Actor]]s and [[clown]]s around the world have painted their faces—and sometimes bodies—for centuries, and continue to do so today. More subdued form of face paints for everyday occasions evolved into the [[cosmetics]] we know today.

For several decades it has been a common entertainment at county [[fair]]s, large open-air [[Market (place)|market]]s (especially in Europe and the Americas), and other locations that attract children and adolescents. Face painting is very popular among children at [[theme park]]s, parties and [[festival]]s throughout the Western world. Though the majority of face painting is geared towards children, many teenagers and adults enjoy being painted for special events, such as sports events (to give support to their team or country) or charity fund raisers. Face painting is also a part of cosplay practice, and is enjoyed yearly by people who dress up as zombies to dance with the annual worldwide "Thrill the World" event on the Saturday before Halloween.

It is common to find if someone is dressed in an animal costume, a black nose will be added alone to give the impression of an animal face and not just body. Sometimes, a full face is added or sometimes none at all.

Most theme parks have booths scattered around where a person can have a design painted on their face. A similar activity is the application of "instant [[tattoo]]s", which are paint or ink-based designs that are put on as one unit and removed by means of water, [[alcohol]], [[soap]], or another mild [[solvent]]. More elaborate [[temporary tattoo]]s may be made using stencils and airbrush equipment.

===In the military===
{{Main|Military camouflage}}
[[File:Maskowanie.JPEG|thumb|right|A soldier applies face paints as [[military camouflage]].]]

It is common in armies all over the world for soldiers in combat to paint their faces and other exposed body parts (hands, for example) in natural colors such as green, tan, and [[loam]] for [[camouflage]] purposes. In various South American armies, it is a tradition to use face paint on parade in respect to the indigenous tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taringa.net/comunidades/naiem/7850065/Brigada-de-Fusileros-Paracaidistas-Mexicanos.html|title=Brigada de Fusileros Paracaidistas Mexicanos|language=es|author=|date=|work=taringa.net|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temporary tattoos==
As well as paint, temporary tattoos can be used to decorate the body. "Glitter tattoos" are made by applying a clear, cosmetic-grade glue (either freehand or through a stencil) on the skin and then coating it with cosmetic-grade [[glitter]]. They can last up to a week depending on the model's body chemistry.

Foil metallic temporary tattoos are a variation of decal-style temporary tattoos, printed using foil stamping technique instead of ink. On the front side, the foil design is printed as a mirror image in order to be viewed in the right direction once it is applied to the skin. Each metallic tattoo is protected by a transparent protective film.

==Body paints==
[[File:Ultraviolet body painting at WBF 2014 1.jpg|thumb|right|Fluorescent body paint will show up as bright and colourful under [[ultraviolet light]].]]
Modern water-based face and body paints are made according to stringent guidelines, meaning these are non-[[toxic]], usually non-[[allergenic]], and can easily be washed away. Temporary staining may develop after use, but it will fade after normal washing. These are either applied with hands, paint brush, and synthetic sponges or natural [[sea sponge]], or alternatively with an [[airbrush]].

[[File:Blacklight bodypainting leevi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Body painting with [[fluorescent]] paint]] 
Contrary to the popular [[List of MythBusters special episodes#Pilot 3 — "Larry's Lawn Chair Balloon, Poppy Seed Drug Test, Goldfinger"|myth]] perpetuated by the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'', a person is not [[asphyxia]]ted if their whole body is painted.&lt;ref&gt;Metin Tolan - Geschüttelt, nicht gerührt, Piper Verlag&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Liquid latex]] may also be used as body paint. Aside the risk of [[Latex allergy|contact allergy]], wearing latex for a prolonged period may cause [[heat stroke]] by inhibiting [[perspiration]] and care should be taken to avoid the painful removal of hair when the latex is pulled off.

The same precautions that apply to [[cosmetics]] should be observed. If the skin shows any sign of [[allergy]] from a paint, its use should immediately be ceased. Moreover, it should not be applied to [[wound|damaged]], inflamed or sensitive skin. If possible, a test for allergic reaction should be performed before use. Special care should be paid to the list of ingredients, as certain dyes are not approved by the US [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] for use around the eye area—generally those associated with certain reddish colorants, as CI 15850 or [[CI 15985]]—or on lips, generally blue, purple or some greens containing [[CI 77007]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Color Additive Status List |url=http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/ColorAdditives/ColorAdditiveInventories/UCM106626 |publisher=The Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=3 August 2011 |date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Summary of Color Additives for Use in United States in Foods, Drugs, Cosmetics, and Medical Devices |url=http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/ColorAdditives/ColorAdditiveInventories/ucm115641.htm#table3A |publisher=The Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=3 August 2011 |date=March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; More stringent regulations are in place in California regarding the amount of permissible [[lead]] on cosmetic additives, as part of [[Proposition 65]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=California Proposition 65 Update: Lead Limits for Cosmetic Products |url=http://www.hktdc.com/info/mi/a/psls/en/1X05YAZ7/1/Product-Safety-Laws-And-Standards/California-Proposition-65-Update-Lead-Limits-For-Cosmetic-Products.htm |publisher=Hong Kong Trade Development Council |accessdate=3 August 2011 |date=18 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the European Union, all colorants listed under a [[Colour Index International|CI]] number are allowed for use on all areas. Any paints or products which have not been formulated for use on the body should never be used for body or face painting, as these can result in serious allergic reactions.

As for [[Mehndi]], natural brown henna dyes are safe to use when mixed with ingredients such as lemon juice. However, a commonly marketed product called "black henna", is not safe to use because the product has been made by mixing natural henna with synthetic black dyes containing [[P-Phenylenediamine|PPD]], which can cause serious skin [[allergies]], and should be avoided due to the substantial risk of serious injury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hennapage.com/henna/ppd/index.html The Henna Page – PPD Black Henna] Retrieved on 2008-05-26&lt;/ref&gt; Another option is Jagua, a dark indigo plant-based dye that is safe to use on the skin and is approved for cosmetic use in the EU.

==Body marbling==
[[File:Body Marbled Hand - 1.jpg|thumb||A hand [[Body marbling|marbled]] by dipping into floating non-toxic paint]]
{{main|Body marbling}}

Hands and faces can be marbled temporarily for events such as festivals, using a painting process similar to traditional [[paper marbling]], in which paint is floated on water and transferred to a person's skin. Unlike the traditional oil-based technique for paper, neon or ultraviolet reactive colours are typically used, and the paint is water-based and non-toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valenti|first1=Lauren|title=The New "Body Marbling" Trend Is Must-See Stuff, People|url=http://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/news/a22529/body-marbling-trend/|publisher=Marie Claire|date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Scott, Ellen |title=Body Marbling Is the New Festival Trend You're Going to Be Obsessed with |url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/09/09/body-marbling-is-the-new-festival-trend-youre-going-to-be-obsessed-with-6119406/ |work=Metro |date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hand art==
"Hand art" is the application of [[make-up]] or paint to a hand to make it appear like an animal or other object. Some hand artists, like [[Guido Daniele]], produce images that are [[trompe l'oeil]] representations of wild animals painted on people's hands.

Hand artists work closely with [[hand model]]s. Hand models can be booked through specialist acting and modeling agencies usually advertising under "body part model" or "hands and feet models".

==Media==

Body painting features in various media. The popular TV variety show, ''[[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In]]'', featured bodies painted with comedic phrases and jokes during transitions. ''[[The Pillow Book (film)|The Pillow Book]]'', a 1996 film by [[Peter Greenaway]], is centred on body painting. The 1990 [[United States|American]] film ''[[Where the Heart Is (1990 film)|Where the Heart Is]]'' featured several examples of models who were painted to blend into elaborate backdrops as [[trompe-l'œil]]. [[Skin Wars]] is a body painting reality competition hosted by [[Rebecca Romijn]] that premiered on [[Game Show Network]] on August 6, 2014.

The '''Cave of the Ramban''' is located in the southern cliff of the Upper [[Kidron Valley]], on a slope descending into the Arab neighborhood of [[Wadi al-Joz]], [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="KlonerYiśraʼel2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Amos Kloner|author2=Agudah le-seḳer arkheʼologi shel Yiśraʼel|title=Survey of Jerusalem: the northeastern sector|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CuMuAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=3 November 2010|year=2001|publisher=Rashut ha-ʻatiḳot, ha-Agudah le-seḳer arkheʼologi shel Yiśraʼel|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed by some to be the traditional burial place of [[Nahmanides]] (also known as Ramban), a foremost rabbinical scholar during the medieval era.

==Burial chamber==
The large [[Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel|rock-hewn cave]], measuring 19 by 20 m, reaches a height of 3.5 meters and is supported by two columns. The area once functioned as an ancient underground [[Jerusalem stone|stone]] quarry. Above the façade, in the upper portion of the cliff, are the remains of a square rock-cut chamber which may have been used for burials.&lt;ref name="KlonerZissu2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Amos Kloner|author2=Boaz Zissu|title=The Necropolis of Jerusalem in the Second Temple period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zeQuAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=3 November 2010|year=2007|publisher=Peeters|isbn=978-90-429-1792-7|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The cave is believed by some Jews to be the site where Ramban prayed in the 13th-century and the place of his interment. It is thus claimed to have been a holy site for Jews for many centuries.&lt;ref name="Guinn2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=David E. Guinn|title=Protecting Jerusalem's holy sites: a strategy for negotiating a sacred peace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9TX_Cs1ndgC&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=3 November 2010|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86662-0|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vilnay2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zev Vilnay|title=Legends of Palestine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VkA6-0-aDdIC&amp;pg=PA102|accessdate=6 November 2010|date=10 March 2003|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-7661-4128-5|pages=100–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the cave became a subject of controversy between a group of Jewish inhabitants in Wadi al-Joz and the Muslim owner of the site, who had fenced off the cave in protest to Jewish settlement in the area.&lt;ref name="Guinn2006"/&gt; The National Authority for Holy Sites convinced the [[Ministry of Religious Services|Ministry of Religious Affairs]] of its religious significance and the cave was declared a holy site and handed over to the ministry’s control.&lt;ref name=YW&gt;[http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/article.php?p=27465 Court: Ramban’s Cave Belongs to the Muslim Waqf], ''theyeshivaworld.com'', December 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim ''[[Jerusalem Islamic Waqf|wakf]]'' subsequently petitioned the [[Supreme Court of Israel|High Court of Justice]] which resulted in a temporary injunction freezing the site's designation. In 2003, a government committee was appointed to examine the issue.&lt;ref name="Guinn2006"/&gt; While acknowledging the site's connection to the Jewish faith, it was decided that the court could rule on the matter. This however was thwarted when the holy status was reinstated by a government minister.&lt;ref name=YW/&gt; The ''wakf'' persisted in its battle for control of the site in the courts and in 2008 it was decided that the cave be placed under the ''wakfs'' authority and Jews were banned from entering.&lt;ref name=YW/&gt;

Other traditions hold that Ramban was buried in [[Silwan]], in [[Hebron]] or in [[Acre, Israel|Acre]].&lt;ref name="MaʻozNusseibeh2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Moshe Maʻoz|author2=Sari Nusseibeh|title=Jerusalem: points of friction, and beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9evpVS_ackwC&amp;pg=PA118|accessdate=3 November 2010|year=2000|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-411-8843-4|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Chav'''" ({{IPAc-en|tʃ|æ|v}} {{respell|CHAV|'}}) ("'''charver'''" in parts of [[Northern England]]) is a [[pejorative]] epithet used in the [[United Kingdom]] to describe a particular [[stereotype]] of anti-social youth dressed in sportswear.&lt;ref name="urlOxfordDictionaries"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/chav |title=Definition of chav in Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English) |format= |work= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fabians&gt;{{cite web|title=Stop using chav: it's deeply offensive |url=http://www.fabians.org.uk/publications/extracts/chav-offensive |accessdate=30 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112002750/http://www.fabians.org.uk/publications/extracts/chav-offensive |archivedate=12 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcworldservice"/&gt; The word was popularised in the 2000s by the British [[mass media]] to refer to an anti-social [[youth subculture]] in the UK.&lt;ref name=agediscrim&gt;{{cite news|last=Heath|first=Olivia|title=Neets, asbos and chavs: labels of age discrimination|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/19/neets-asbos-chavs-young-people|work=The Guardian|accessdate=13 April 2012|date=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines "chav" as an informal British derogatory, meaning "a young lower-class person who displays brash and loutish behaviour and wears real or imitation designer clothes".&lt;ref name="oxford-dictionaries"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Dictionaries|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/chav?q=chav|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The derivative '''chavette''' has been used to refer to females,&lt;ref name="TheSundayNightProject" /&gt; and the adjectives ''chavvy'', ''chavvish'' and ''chavtastic'' have been used in relation to items designed for or suitable for use by chavs.&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;

==Etymology==
Opinion is divided on the origin of the term. "Chav" may have its origins in the [[Romani language|Romani]] word "chavi", meaning "child".&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4074760.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; 'Asbo' and 'chav' make dictionary |publisher=BBC News |date=8 June 2005 |accessdate=2011-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wwwchav" /&gt;  The word "chavvy" has existed since at least the 19th century; lexicographer Eric Partridge mentions it in his 1950 dictionary of slang and unconventional English, giving its date of origin as c. 1860.&lt;ref name=Partridge&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|publisher=The MacMillan Company|edition=Third|location=New York|date=1950|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word in its current pejorative usage is recorded by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' as first used in a [[Usenet newsgroup|Usenet forum]] in 1998 and first used in a newspaper in 2002.&lt;ref name=bbcchav&gt;{{cite news|title=Why is 'chav' still controversial?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13626046|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 April 2012|date=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2005 the term had become widespread in its use as to refer to a type of anti-social, uncultured youth, who wear a lot of flashy jewellery, white [[athletic shoes|trainers]], [[baseball caps]], and sham [[designer clothes]]; the girls expose a lot of midriff.&lt;ref name="bbcworldservice"/&gt;

In his 2011 book, ''[[Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class]]'', [[Owen Jones (writer)|Owen Jones]] surmised that the word is an attack on the poor.&lt;ref name="bbc-june-2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why is 'chav' still controversial?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13626046|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010 book ''Stab Proof Scarecrows'' by Lance Manley, it was surmised that "chav" was an abbreviation for "[[council house]]d and violent".&lt;ref name=stabproof&gt;{{cite book|last=Manley|first=Lance|title=Stab Proof Scarecrows, A Memoir Looking at Policing in the UK from a Trainee's Perspective|year=2010|publisher=Matador, Troubador Publishing Ltd|location=Leicester, England|isbn=978-1-84876-297-8|page=369}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is widely regarded as a  [[backronym]], a constructed acronym created to fit an existing word.&lt;ref name="wwwchav" /&gt; This interpretation of the word was used in a 2012 public statement by Rapper [[Plan B (musician)|Plan B]] as he spoke out to oppose the use of the term.&lt;ref name=Planb&gt;{{cite web|last=Holden|first=Steve|title=Plan B criticises word chav ahead of Ill Manors release|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/17352999|publisher=BBC|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 linguist [[David Crystal]] said on [[BBC Learning English]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;People talk about "chav behaviour" or "chav insults" and that sort of thing. Oh, don't believe the popular etymologies that you read sometimes in the press and on websites. I saw one the other day, people said, "It's an acronym, 'chav', from 'council house and violent'"—well, no, it isn't, that was made up in recent times.&lt;ref name=bbcworldservice&gt;{{cite web|last=Crystal|first=Professor David|title=Keep your English up to date  Chav|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/radio/specials/1130_uptodate2/page7.shtml|work=Keep Your English Up To date|publisher=BBC World Service|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Stereotype==
Besides referring to loutish behaviour, violence, and particular speech patterns, the chav stereotype includes wearing branded designer [[sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]],&lt;ref name="AtkinsonYoung2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atkinson|first1=Michael|last2=Young|first2=Kevin|title=Tribal play: subcultural journeys through sport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ush9CBSByIcC&amp;pg=PA265|accessdate=12 August 2011|date=18 June 2008|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|isbn=978-0-7623-1293-1|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may be accompanied by some form of flashy gold [[jewellery]] otherwise termed as "[[bling]]".&lt;ref name=kingbling&gt;{{cite news|last=Larcombe|first=Duncan|date=10 April 2006|title=Future bling of England|url= http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article44322.ece|dead-url=no|work=The Sun|location=London|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110602014012/http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article44322.ece|archive-date=2011-06-02|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been described as adopting "black culture", and use some [[Jamaican patois]] in their slang.&lt;ref name="Kapoor2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nisha Kapoor|title=The State of Race|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=858UfY4RJmIC&amp;pg=PA50|date=28 June 2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-31308-9|pages=50–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a case where a teenage woman was barred from her own home under the terms of an [[anti-social behaviour order]] in 2005, some British national newspapers branded her "the real-life [[List of Little Britain characters#Vicky Pollard|Vicky Pollard]]" with the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' running headlines reading, "Good riddance to chav scum: real life Vicky Pollard evicted",&lt;ref name=Guardianchav&gt;{{cite news|title=No but yeah but no|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/may/12/pressandpublishing.penal|work=The Guardian|accessdate=13 April 2012|date=12 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; both referring to a [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] comedy character.  Created by radio host Matt Lucas for the show ''[[Little Britain]]'', the character Vicky Pollard is a teenage girl intended to parody a chav. A 2006 survey by [[YouGov]] suggested 70% of TV industry professionals believed that Vicky Pollard was an accurate reflection of white working-class youth.&lt;ref name="bbcchav" /&gt; The same year, [[Prince William of Wales]] wore a chav outfit for a fancy dress photograph marking the completion of his first term at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]] military academy, resulting in headlines in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper naming him "Future Bling of England". The article quoted a cadet as saying, "William has a great sense of humour and went to a lot of trouble thinking up what to wear".&lt;ref name="kingbling" /&gt;

Response to the stereotype has ranged from amusement to criticism, with some saying that it is a new manifestation of [[classism]].&lt;ref name="Wills Fancy Dress" /&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2011 identified issues stemming from the use of the terms "[[Hoodie#United Kingdom|hoodies]]" and "chav" within the mass media, which had led to age discrimination as a result of mass media-created stereotypes.&lt;ref name="agediscrim" /&gt;

===Commercial effect===
In 2005 the fashion house [[Burberry]], whilst deriding chavs, claimed that the widespread fashion in the UK of chavs wearing its branded style ([[Burberry#Checks|Burberry check]]) was due to the widespread availability of cheaper [[counterfeit]] versions.&lt;ref name="Sun2005" /&gt; In 2008, in response to the continuing rise in popularity among chavs of the Burberry brand, [[Christopher Bailey (fashion designer)|Christopher Bailey]], who was responsible for the company’s image, said "I'm proud we had such a democratic appeal."&lt;ref name=baily&gt;{{cite news|title=The luxury brand with a chequered past, Burberry's shaken off its chav image to become the fashionistas' favourite once more|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1023460/Burberrys-shaken-chav-image-fashionistas-favourite-more.html#ixzz1rto81cfv|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=13 April 2012|first=Liz|last=Jones|date=2 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The large supermarket chain [[Asda]] has attempted to trademark the word "chav" for a line of confectionery. A spokeswoman said, "With slogans from characters in shows such as ''[[Little Britain]]'' and ''[[The Catherine Tate Show]]'' providing us with more and more contemporary slang, our "Whatever" sweets – now nicknamed chav hearts – have become very popular with kids and grown-ups alike. We thought we needed to give them some respect and have decided to trademark our sweets."&lt;ref name="Asda" /&gt;

==Criticism of the stereotype==
A [[BBC TV]] documentary suggested that chav culture is an evolution of previous working-class youth subcultures associated with particular commercial clothing styles, such as [[mod (subculture)|mods]], [[skinhead]]s, and [[casual (subculture)|casuals]].&lt;ref name="stylegenius"/&gt;

In a February 2005 article in ''[[The Times]]'', [[Julie Burchill]] argued that use of the word is a form of "social [[racism]]", and that such "sneering" reveals more about the shortcomings of the "chav-haters" than those of their supposed victims.&lt;ref name="Burchill2005" /&gt; The writer [[John Harris (critic)|John Harris]] argued along similar lines in a 2007 article in ''The Guardian''.&lt;ref name="Harris06" /&gt; The widespread use of the "chav" stereotype has been criticised.&lt;ref name="Hayward2006" /&gt; Some argue that it amounts to simple snobbery and elitism.&lt;ref name="Wills Fancy Dress"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hampson" /&gt; Critics of the term have argued that its users are "neo-snobs",&lt;ref name="Bennett" /&gt; and that its increasing popularity raises questions about how British society deals with [[social mobility]] and class.&lt;ref name=bbcnews&gt;{{cite news|last=BBC|title=Stop use of 'Chav' – think tank|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7509968.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 April 2012|date=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fabian Society]] considers the term to be offensive and regards it as "sneering and patronising" to a largely voiceless group. On describing those who use the word, the society stated that "we all know their old serviette/napkin, lounge/living room, settee/sofa tricks. But this is something new. This is middle class hatred of the white working class, pure and simple."&lt;ref name="Fabians" /&gt; The Fabian Society have been highly critical of the BBC in using the term in broadcasts.&lt;ref name="Fabians" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcnews" /&gt; Use of the term 'chav' was reported in ''The Guardian'' in 2011 as "class abuse by people asserting superiority".&lt;ref name=royalprinces&gt;{{cite news|last=Toynbee|first=Polly|title=Chav: the vile word at the heart of fractured Britain|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/31/chav-vile-word-fractured-britain|work=Fostering the loathing of a feral underclass allows public resentment to be diverted from those above to those below|accessdate=14 April 2012|date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
By 2004, the word was used in national newspapers and common parlance in the UK. [[Susie Dent]]'s ''Larpers and Shroomers: The Language Report'', published by the [[Oxford University Press]], designated it as the "word of the year"&lt;ref name="Noel-Tod" /&gt; in 2004.&lt;ref name="larpers" /&gt;

Characters described as "chavs" have been featured in numerous British television programmes, as well as films. The character, clothing, attitude and musical interests of [[Lauren Cooper]] and her friends in the BBC comedy series, ''[[The Catherine Tate Show]],'' have been associated with the chav stereotype.&lt;ref name="metro2009" /&gt; The comedy series ''[[Little Britain]]'' features a character intended as a chav parody, [[Vicky Pollard]].&lt;ref name="mail2009" /&gt; In the British television series ''[[Misfits (TV series)|Misfits]]'', the character of [[Kelly Bailey (Misfits)|Kelly Bailey]] is presented as a stereotypical "chav".&lt;ref name="E4MK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e4.com/misfits/characters/kelly.html|title=Misfits – Kelly|publisher=[[E4 (channel)|E4.com]]|accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lauren Socha]], the actress who portrays Kelly, has described the character as being "a bit chavvy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lauren likes her Misfits character|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/800584-lauren-likes-her-misfits-character|accessdate=23 November 2011|newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' has referred to the character as "[a] chavvish girl",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6914519.ece|title=Misfits review by The Times|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=23 November 2011|first=Sadie|last=Gray}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the character has been said to possess a "chav accent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Laws |first=Rob |title=Misfits star Lauren Socha reveals why she's changing her accent |url=http://www.sundaymercury.net/entertainment-news/tv-news/2010/11/21/misfits-star-lauren-socha-reveals-why-she-s-changing-her-accent-66331-27682332/ |accessdate=23 November 2011 |newspaper=[[Sunday Mercury]] |date=21 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117001304/http://www.sundaymercury.net/entertainment-news/tv-news/2010/11/21/misfits-star-lauren-socha-reveals-why-she-s-changing-her-accent-66331-27682332/ |archivedate=17 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the "[[New Earth (Doctor Who)|New Earth]]" episode of the BBC TV series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the character [[Cassandra (Doctor Who)|Lady Cassandra]] is transplanted into [[Rose Tyler|Rose Tyler's]] body ([[Billie Piper]]). When Cassandra sees herself in a mirror, she exclaims "Oh my God... I'm a chav!"&lt;ref name="newearth"/&gt; In ''[[Kingsman: The Secret Service]]'', the main character Eggsy Unwin ([[Taron Egerton]]) is introduced as a stereotypical chav.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/02/kingsman-the-secret-service-review |title=''Kingsman: The Secret Service'' Is Crazy Violent, and Endlessly Entertaining |author=Lawson, Richard |publisher=''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' |date=12 February 2015 |accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |quote=In Britain there are many words to describe people from this social group, and they are often limited to a particular town or region. Other words with a similar meaning to chav are townie, scally, ned and charver. The word chav has become common in southern England, and is generally thought to come from Chatham girls (Chatham is a town in Kent.) Some people think, however, that the word comes originally from the Romany word chavo (boy), which is also the origin of the Spanish word chaval.}}

{{Culture of Qatar}}
The ruling family of [[Qatar]], the [[House of Thani]], is deeply involved in the field of art. For more than twenty years, some of its members have been accumulating numerous and precious pieces of artwork.

The project [[Qatar National Vision 2030]] promotes the creation of new schools, new universities and new museums.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21551443|title=Qatar’s culture queen|work=The Economist|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cultural development, characterized by new museums and exhibitions, is therefore closely linked to the political motive of building a “knowledge-based economy” in Qatar by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyas.org/publications/ebriefings/Detail.aspx?cid=1e72282c-fdfb-48c1-a26b-866a2aa7ec6a|title=Building a Knowledge-based Economy in Qatar|publisher=|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journalist Barbara Pollack underlines the central role of the Al-Thani family while comparing Qatar's and [[Cultural policy in Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi’s cultural policies]]: "While Abu Dhabi is making a name for itself by building dramatic local satellites of the Louvres, the Guggenheim and the British Museum, Qatar's scheme of cultural nation building is much more homegrown, establishing its own museums rooted in the collections of its own royal family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/reviews/pollack/mathaf-arab-museum-of-modern-art-in-doha12-23-10.asp|title=Mathaf, Arab Museum of Modern Art opens in Doha in Qatar - artnet Magazine|date=23 December 2010|publisher=|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collecting strategy of the Al-Thani family ==

=== Active members of the royal family ===

Several members of the Al-Thani family initially led Qatar's interest and involvement into the field of arts and continue to embody and shape the cultural policy of the country.&lt;ref name="Al-Thani's involvement in the arts, Robert Kluijver"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfartguide.com/essay/the-al-thanis-involvement-in-the-arts/|title=The Al Thani’s involvement in the arts|publisher=|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For William Lawrie, previously Head of International Modern Contemporary Arab and Iranian Art at [[Christie's]], “Qatar’s royal family are very much like modern-day equivalents of the [[Medicis]] in 16th-century Florence”.&lt;ref name="An Emirate Filling Up With Artwork"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/world/middleeast/in-qatar-artists-and-collectors-find-a-new-market.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=An Emirate Filling Up With Artwork|publisher=New York Times|date=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Sheikh Saud’s older brother, [[Hassan bin Mohamed bin Ali Al Thani]] owns one of the most extensive collections of modern Arab art in the world, estimated at 6,300 pieces.&lt;ref name="Al-Thani's involvement in the arts, Robert Kluijver"/&gt; While studying Art in Qatar University in the mid-1980s, he became deeply interested in 20th-century Arabic painting, and most particularly in Iraqi painters.&lt;ref name="Christian Chesnot,Georges Malbrunot, ''Qatar: les clés du coffre-fort''"&gt;[Christian Chesnot,Georges Malbrunot, ''Qatar: les clés du coffre-fort'']&lt;/ref&gt; Aware that art in general was "absent from Qatari life" at that time, he pursued the discovery of Arab artists.&lt;ref name="Sajjil: A Century of Modern Art"&gt;[Sajjil: A Century of Modern Art],  Nada Shabout, Wassan Al-khudhairi, Deena Chalabi.&lt;/ref&gt; If Sheikh Hassan’s collection was primarily developed out of his personal interest in art and was not directed towards a specific audience, it now forms the core of the [[Mathaf]] museum.
* [[Saud bin Muhammed Al Thani]], Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani's cousin and former president of Qatar's National Council for culture, Arts and Heritage possesses a large collection of traditional art pieces, such as manuscripts, carpets, scientific instruments and Mughai Jewellery.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; He largely contributes at establishing collections for five existing and planned museums: the Museum of Islamic Art, the National Library, the Natural History Museum, a photography museum and a traditional textiles and clothes museum.&lt;ref name="Al-Thani's involvement in the arts, Robert Kluijver"/&gt;
* The emir's daughter [[Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani]] now embodies the involvement of Qatar's ruling family in art.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; As head of the [[Qatar Museums Authority]] (QMA), she is "arguably the most powerful woman in the art world today", according to the magazine ''Forbes'', which ranked her among the 100 most powerful women of the world in 2012.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; In 2011, ''[[Art+Auction]]'' magazine ranked her number one for the art world’s most influential people.&lt;ref name="Qatari Emir's daughter named art world's most influential person"&gt;[http://dohanews.co/post/13672356727/qatari-emirs-daughter-named-art-worlds-most Qatari Emir's daughter named art world’s most influential person].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Benjamin Genocchio, editor in chief of ''Art+Auction'', "Sheikha Al-Mayassa has the resources of an entire country at her disposal."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dohanews.co/post/13672356727/qatari-emirs-daughter-named-art-worlds-most Qatari Emir's daughter named art world's most influential person | Doha News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Qatari presence on the art market ===

Qatar is depicted as a new "market maker" on the art market.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradearabia.com/news/REAL_222998.html|title=Qatar a top player in art, museum markets|publisher=|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[The Art Newspaper]] revealed Qatar is the world’s biggest art buyer.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Qatar-revealed-as-the-world%E2%80%99s-biggest-contemporary-art-buyer/24185 Qatar revealed as the world’s biggest contemporary art buyer - The Art Newspaper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many commentators report a faultless strategy:&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.dohapress.com/portal/index.php/57-all-local-news/17856-qatar-a-top-player-in-art-museum-markets dohapress - Qatar a top player in art, museum markets&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130629011827/http://www.dohapress.com/portal/index.php/57-all-local-news/17856-qatar-a-top-player-in-art-museum-markets |date=2013-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Qatar bid systematically for famous pieces of art. It is a pragmatic but visionary approach that led the country to establish itself as a main player of the world art market. Qatar is advised by high-skilled international experts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/culture/offensive-du-qatar-sur-le-marche-de-l-art-26-09-2012-1510354_3.php|title=Offensive du Qatar sur le marché de l'art|author=Le Point, magazine|work=Le Point|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thierry Ehrmann, president and founder of Artprice ("the world leader in art market information"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.artprice.com/en/|title=Art market, auction sales and artist’s prices and indices - Artprice, the world leader of art market information.|publisher=|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) asserts that Qatar has implemented an “outstanding war machine” to make of Doha a “world capital of art”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.lesechos.fr/redirect_article.php?id=0202290809093|title=Les Echos.fr - Actualité à la Une  - Les Echos|publisher=|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him: "Qatar does not take any risk, takes the best and is willing to pay whatever it takes."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

=== Large financial resources ===

One of the most striking facts about Qatar's presence on the art market is the massive financial resources involved. The royal family and Qatar's cultural institution are upscale subscribers to the databank on art prices and indices Artprice Group.  A study conducted by Artprice and Organ Museum Research over the period 2000-2012 revealed that Qatar bid for art works with a margin of 40 to 45% above "market prices".&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Hence Forbes Magazine estimates that the annual budget for the sole Qatar Museum Authority is about $250 million.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/sheikha-mayassa-al-thani/|title=Sheikha Mayassa Al Thani|author=Michael Kanellos|work=Forbes|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief executive of the Fine Art Fund Group, an art investment management and consulting firm based in London, estimates that Qatari buyers make up to 25 percent of the Middle East's $11 billion art market.&lt;ref name="An Emirate Filling Up With Artwork" /&gt;

== Al-Thani's art collection: overview ==
[[File:121 Snowy Owl.jpg|thumbnail|Audubon, Snowy Owl]]
For more than twenty years, the Al-Thani family had been buying a large collection of art works, from traditional Islamic artifacts to famous pieces of modern and contemporary art

=== Antiques ===

Partly as a consequence of Sheikh Saud's significant interest into traditional art, the Al-Thani family possesses a wide collection of Islamic, Roman and Egyptian art and antiques, alongside a wide range of artifacts from all over the world.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulfrasercollectibles.com/News/ART-%26-PHOTOGRAPHY/2011-News-Archive/The-vast-and-spectacular-collections-of-Sheikh-Saud-al-Thani-of-Qatar/7076.page|title=The Vast And Spectacular Collections Of Sheikh Saud Al Thani Of Qatar|work=JustCollecting|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection includes:&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/17797006|title=A Smithsonian in the sand|work=The Economist|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Artifacts (glass, carpets, astrolables)
* Korans, manuscripts
* Rare books, including a complete set of [[John James Audubon]]'s ''[[The Birds of America|Birds of America]]''&lt;ref name="‘Birds Of America’ Sells for $8.8 Million"&gt;[http://www.artandantiquesmag.com/2009/02/call-of-the-wild/ Birds Of America’ Sells for $8.8 Million], Art&amp;Antiques.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Persian miniature]]s
* Fine jewellery
* 18th-century French furniture
* Natural history prints and specimens

=== Western art ===

Estimates show that the Al-Thani has spent at least $1 billion on Western painting and sculpture over the last twenty years.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Sheikha Al-Mayassa is known for being particularly interested in the work of Western contemporary art's big names, such as [[Jeff Koons]], [[Takashi Murakami]], [[Damien Hirst]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Louise Bourgeois]] and [[Mark Rothko]] .&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;

The royal family of Qatar currently owns one painting of the series ''[[The Card Players]]'' by the French artist [[Paul Cézanne]].
[[File:Paul Cézanne 222.jpg|thumbnail|Paul Cézanne, ''The Card Players'']]

As a prominent buyer on the art market, the Al-Thani family has significantly expanded its modern art collection. The family owns notably:
* Mark Rothko's painting ''[[White Center (Yellow, Pink and Lavender on Rose)]]''
* [[Francis Bacon]]'s ''Study from Innocent X''
* [[Damien Hirst]]'s ''Lullaby Spring''

=== Middle-Eastern and North African art ===
In addition to building collections of works by international artists, the Al-Thani family is committed to developing Arab contemporary art and supporting regional artists. The credit goes in the first place to Sheikh [[Hassan bin Mohamed bin Ali Al Thani]], who began buying Arab art in the mid-1980s while very little attention had been carried out on the region's artistic movements. In 1986, he started collaborating with the artist and art educator [[Yousef Ahmad]].

Hassan Al-Thani supported Iraqi artists after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the first Gulf War. He owns an extensive collection of art pieces produced by two of the most well-known Iraqi artists [[Ismail Fatah Al Turk]] and [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]]. His collection of Iraqi art is known as the biggest in the world.&lt;ref name="Art in Qatar: A Smithsonian in the sand"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/17797006 Art in Qatar: A Smithsonian in the sand], The Economist.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Antonia Carver, Fair Director of Art Dubai, "News about Cézanne and Damien Hirst hits headlines, but it’s perhaps these more localized forms of patronage — such as Sheik Hassan’s care for Iraqi artists over several decades — that are particularly meaningful within the region."&lt;ref name="An Emirate Filling Up With Artwork" /&gt;

The exhibition for the opening of [[Mathaf]] in December 2010 featured art pieces of several Arab artists, such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2010/12/18/doha-et-le-culot-de-l-art-moderne-arabe_1455368_3246.html|title=Doha et le culot de l'art moderne arabe|author=Harry Bellet – Doha, envoyé spécial|work=Le Monde.fr|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* French artists of Algerian origin Kader Attia and Zineb Sedira
* Iraqi Adel Abidin
* Palestinian Khalil Rabah
* Moroccans Farid Belkahia and [[Mounir Fatmi]]
* Egyptians Ahmed Nouar and [[Ghada Amer]]
* Lebanese [[Walid Raad]]

=== Photography ===

Saud Al-Thani bought quite important photographs collections, notably 136 vintage photographs including pieces by [[Alfred Stieglitz]] and [[Man Ray]] in 2000 and a black and white photograph by [[Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey]] in 2003 for £565,250, which settled a new world record&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;

== Al-Thani's collection displayed: museums and exhibitions ==

With such wide art collections, Qatar proceeds for several years to build museums and to sponsor exhibition to host them. It makes part of Qatar's strategy to be acknowledged as a main worldwide actor.

=== Museums ===
[[File:Museum of Islamic arts SOP.jpg|thumb|[[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha]], designed by [[I.M. Pei]]]]
==== Qatar Museums Authority ====

One significant innovation has been the establishment of the [[Qatar Museums Authority]] in 2005, a government body that cooperates with the Culture Ministry but which is, according to ''The Economist'', "above all a family affair".&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Interviewed by the English newspaper, Sheikha Al-Mayassa asserts, "The QMA is very much my father’s baby. He wanted to create something to connect with the community, to create a cultural dialogue within society (…) we want the QMA to be a 'cultural instigator', a catalyst of arts projects worldwide."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

==== Museum of Islamic Art ====

Qatar's ambition to become the most important cultural destination of the Gulf’s area was made concrete in 2008 with the opening of the MIA, the [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha|Museum of Islamic Art]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; It was designed by [[I.M. Pei]], the Chinese-American architect that notably built the glass pyramid for [[the Louvre]] in Paris. It is considered to be one of the world’s great museums.&lt;ref name="Museum of Islamic Art in Doha"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/9943622/Museum-of-Islamic-Art-in-Doha-Its-about-creating-an-audience-for-art.html Museum of Islamic Art in Doha].&lt;/ref&gt;

* MIA Park
The inauguration of the new public space was a key event of the year 2011. Developed by QMA and located on the grounds of the MIA, the park notably includes [[Richard Serra '7']]. The 80-foot-high sculpture is the American artist's first public work in the Middle East. The Emir Sheikh [[Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani]] was present during the inaugural ceremony, along with 700 guests. During her speech, Sheikha Al Mayassa asserted that the new park will invite the citizens of Doha to interact with contemporary and other creative arts. At the same time, the new park will complement and enhance the Museum of Islamic Art designed by my father."&lt;ref name="Official Unveiling of a new 80-Foot-High Sculpture by Richard Serra"&gt;[http://www.qma.com.qa/en/news/news-archive/389-official-unveiling-of-a-new-80-foot-high-sculpture-by-richard-serra Official Unveiling of a new 80-Foot-High Sculpture by Richard Serra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406173013/http://qma.com.qa/en/news/news-archive/389-official-unveiling-of-a-new-80-foot-high-sculpture-by-richard-serra |date=2013-04-06 }}, 15/12/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mathaf ====

The growing interest for Arab Modern art is symbolized by the opening of [[Mathaf]] in December 2010 (Mathaf is the Arabic word for museum). Based on a collection of paintings and other art pieces from the 1840s, this embryo project aims to give modern art a wider audience in the Arab world. “We are making Qatar the place to see, explore and discuss the creations of Arab artists of the modern era and of our own time” says Sheikha al-Mayassa al-Thani&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

Its originator and most fervent defender, Sheikh [[Hassan bin Mohamed bin Ali Al Thani]] explains how the museum was aimed at filling a void in modern Arab art in Qatar: "Since the collection had increased its representation of periods and styles, I began planning to make it part of a specific project. At the time, I did not know of any museum of Arab art from the 19th century to today. As a painter and photographer — simply put, as an artist — I was passionate about modern and contemporary art and artistic movements in the Arab world. But only in Egypt could you find quality museums devoted to the history of Arab art and its different forms of expression. Otherwise there was almost nothing anywhere. So instead of continuing in the darkness, I decided to light a light".&lt;ref name="Shining a Light: Sheikh Hassan Al-Thani on Qatar's First Museum of Modern Arab Art"&gt;[http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/36609/shining-a-light-sheikh-hassan-al-thani-on-qatars-first-museum-of-modern-arab-art Shining a Light: Sheikh Hassan Al-Thani on Qatar's First Museum of Modern Arab Art].&lt;/ref&gt;

==== National Museum of Qatar ====

One of the biggest projects of Qatar is the opening of the National Museum that was scheduled to open in 2016. As for the MIA, Qatar succeeded in involving the well-known French architect [[Jean Nouvel]] on the project.

====Sheikh Faisal Bin Qassim Museum====
The [[Sheikh Faisal Bin Qassim Al Thani Museum]] was opened in 1998 and currently showcases over 15,000 artifacts that were collected by Faisal Bin Qassim Al Thani over a span of several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-25/hidden-qatar-billionaire-al-thani-seen-with-hotel-empire|title=Hidden Qatar Billionaire Al-Thani Seen With Hotel Empire|publisher=Bloomberg|author=Devon Pendleton|date=25 March 2014|accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art events ===

Besides largely contributing to the construction of new museums, Al-Thani Family is involved in a wide range of art events.

* Murakami Ego and Qatar Japan 2012

In 2010, Qatar funded the exhibition of the Japanese artist Takashi Murakami, known as [[Murakami-Ego]] and shown at the [[Palace of Versailles]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="Murakami Versailles"&gt;[http://www.chateauversailles.fr/index.php?option=com_cdvfiche&amp;view=cdvchapitre&amp;template=blank&amp;idr=4028A278-9490-AAA2-23BD-969CF32A1C61&amp;idc=BC34C6D8-D61E-9849-D601-77977BC22A0B Murakami Versailles].&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was later shown in Doha in 2012.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; The Museum of Islamic Art was initially proposed, yet the Japanese artist found the space not large enough. A temporary hall was built instead, known as the Al Riwaq exhibition space, located near the MIA.&lt;ref name="Art in the Middle East Dubai &amp; Doha, Sima Familant"&gt;[http://www.simafamilant.com/dubai-doha Art in the Middle East Dubai &amp; Doha, Sima Familant], 10/05/2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first exhibition displayed by Murakami in the Middle East.  Murakami-Ego was the launching event of Qatar-Japan 2012, an initiative aimed at reinforcing the diplomatic relations between the two countries through a series of cultural and sporting activities.&lt;ref name="Murakami’s First Exhibition in the Middle East"&gt;[http://qatarjapan2012.com/online/en/details/109 Murakami’s First Exhibition in the Middle East]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Louise Bourgeois and ''[[Maman (sculpture)|Maman]]''

From January to June 2012, [[Qatar Museums Authority]] organized the exhibition "Conscious and Unconscious", gathering about 30 works of art created by [[Louise Bourgeois]] between 1947 and 2009.&lt;ref name="Louise Bourgeois: Conscious and Unconscious"&gt;[http://www.qma.com.qa/en/news/news-archive/409-louise-bourgeois-conscious-and-unconscious Louise Bourgeois: Conscious and Unconscious] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408092408/http://qma.com.qa/en/news/news-archive/409-louise-bourgeois-conscious-and-unconscious |date=2013-04-08 }}, QMA.&lt;/ref&gt; The centrepiece of the exhibition is the famous 9-meter-high bronze spider sculpture ''[[Maman (sculpture)|Maman]]''. QMA's chairperson, Sheikha Al-Mayassa, commented on the importance of the sculpture to Qatar: "Louise Bourgeois' ''Maman'' is a true icon of 20th Century art, an artwork that has captured the attention of millions around the world.  We are proud to present this magnificent sculpture at the [[Qatar National Convention Centre]]. Through displaying various forms of art in public spaces we aim to inspire local talent and to establish an organic connection between art and the local community.".&lt;ref name="QMA unveils new spider sculpture"&gt;[http://www.qma.com.qa/en/news/news-archive/346-qatar-museums-authority-unveils-new-spider-sculpture-at-qatar-national-convention-center QMA unveils new spider sculpture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406173728/http://qma.com.qa/en/news/news-archive/346-qatar-museums-authority-unveils-new-spider-sculpture-at-qatar-national-convention-center |date=2013-04-06 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture will stay permanently in Doha.

* Photography Contest: Al-Thani award for Photography

The Photography Competition, created in 2001, is amply sponsored by [[Saud bin Muhammed Al Thani]]. It has greatly expanded over the last 12 years, opened to the Gulf Region in 2003, to the Arab World in 2005. It became an international competition in 2006.&lt;ref name="Thousands of entries for annual Al-Thani award for Photography"&gt;[http://thepeninsulaqatar.com/cover-plus/213212-thousands-of-entries-for-annual-al-thani-award-for-photography.html Thousands of entries for annual Al-Thani award for Photography], The Peninsula Qatar, 05/11/2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

The active participation of the ruling family in the art market has invited some controversy and criticism concerning transaction opacity and the public/private nature of financial resources involved.

=== Opacity and secrecy ===

Al Thani family formally refuses to confirm or deny the rumours circulating over the art acquisitions of these past years. It is therefore particularly hard to assess whether these acquisitions are purely private or done on behalf of the State.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

=== Saud al Thani under house arrest in 2005 ===

In 2005, Saud Bin Mohammed Al-Thani was sued for not fulfilling a payment of $20 million for ancient Greek coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2226278/Royal-sheikh-spent-1billion-art-collection-accused-leaving-extraordinary-trail-unpaid-debt-worlds-auction-houses.html|title=Royal sheikh who spent more than £1billion on his art collection is accused of leaving  'extraordinary trail' of unpaid debt around world's top auction houses - Daily Mail Online|work=Mail Online|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event rekindled the concerns about his huge spending on art artifacts, estimated at $2.5 billion over eight years.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;

A '''collective work''' in the [[Copyright law of the United States]] is a work that contains the works of several authors assembled and published into a collective whole. 
The owner of the work has the property rights in the [[collective work]], but the authors of the individual works may retain rights in their contributions.
Electronic reproduction of the whole work is allowed, but electronic reproduction of the individual works on their own, outside the context of the work as a whole, may constitute an infringement of copyright.

==Definition==

The [[Copyright Act of 1976]], section 101, defines a collective work as "a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology, or encyclopedia, in which a number of contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole". 
It is protected as long as the "author" can show that the selection and organization of the contributions is original, and that these contribution can themselves be protected, as opposed to being mere facts such as statistical data.{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}
The act makes a clear distinction between the collective work and the individual contributions, 
{{quote|Copyright in each separate contribution to a collective work is distinct from copyright in the collective work as a whole and vests initially in the author of the contribution. In the absence of an express transfer of the copyright or of any rights under it, the owner of copyright in the collective work is presumed to have acquired only the privilege of reproducing and distributing the contribution as part of that particular collective work, any revision of that collective work, and any later collective work in the same series.{{sfn|Leaffer|2010|loc=PT176}} }}
The [[United States Copyright Office]] says, 
{{quote|A compilation or a collective work may be registered with the U.S. Copyright Office, provided that it constitutes copyrightable subject matter. As discussed in Section 307, compilations and collective works are a subset of the subject matter categories set forth in Section 102(a) of the Copyright Act, rather than separate and distinct categories of works. ... Thus, a compilation or a collective work must qualify as a literary work; a musical work; a dramatic work; a pantomime or choreographic work; a pictorial, graphic or sculptural work; a motion picture or audiovisual work; a sound recording; and/or an architectural work.{{sfn|Copyrightable Authorship: What Can Be Registered – U.S.|loc=312.1}} }}

Because a collective work is a form of compilation,  the U.S. Copyright Office will apply the criteria for compilations to determine whether the author’s selection, coordination, and/or arrangement satisfies the originality requirement.{{sfn|Copyrightable Authorship: What Can Be Registered – U.S.|loc=312.3}}
Thus a website will be protected only if the author used creativity or subjective judgement to select and arrange the material.{{sfn|Fishman|2007|p=23}}
Ordinarily, the Office will not examine the preexisting material that appears in a [[derivative work]], a compilation, or a collective work to determine whether that material is protected by copyright or whether it has been used in a lawful manner.{{sfn|Copyrightable Authorship: What Can Be Registered – U.S.|loc=313.6(B)}}

==History==

The first copyright law in the United States, the [[Copyright Act of 1790]], covered maps, charts or books. 
The printed work was protected for 14 years from registration of its title with the district court, and could be renewed for another 14 years by the author, if still alive.
It did not provide for the copyright to be vested initially in an individual or employee who ordered or commissioned a map, chart or book.
The work only covered American authors, allowing publishers to flood the market with cheap reprints of British books.{{sfn|Patry|1994}}
The first major revision was the [[Copyright Act of 1831]], which extended the initial term to 28 years with the option to renew for another 14 years, and granted widows and children of deceased authors the right of renewal.{{sfn|Bracha|2008}}

The [[Copyright Act of 1909]], which became {{USPL|60|349}} on March 4, 1909, covered books, including composite and cyclopaedic works, directories, gazetteers, and other compilations; periodicals, including newspapers; and other works such as lectures, sermons, musical compositions, works of art and maps.{{sfn|An act to amend and consolidate ... 1909|loc=Sec. 5}}
Copyright was secured by publication with a notice of copyright.{{sfn|An act to amend and consolidate ... 1909|loc=Sec. 9}}
The owner was also required to deposit copies of the work with the copyright office.{{sfn|An act to amend and consolidate ... 1909|loc=Sec. 12}}
Copyright protection was for 28 years from date of publication, with the option to renew for a further 28 years.
Copyright could be registered and renewed for a contribution to a periodical or to a cyclopaedic or other composite work.{{sfn|An act to amend and consolidate ... 1909|loc=Sec. 23}}
Section 6 of the Act specified:
{{quote|That compilations or abridgements, adaptations, arrangements, dramatizations, translations, or other versions of works in the public domain, or of copyrighted works when produced with the consent of the proprietor of the copyright in such works, or works republished with new matter, shall be regarded as new works subject to copyright under the provisions of this Act; but the publication of any such new works shall not affect the force or validity of any subsisting copyright upon the matter employed or any part thereof, or be construed to imply an exclusive right to such use of the original works, or to secure or extend copyright in such original works.{{sfn|An act to amend and consolidate ... 1909|loc=Sec. 6}}}}

The 1909 Act was repealed and superseded by the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], but remains effective for copyrighted works created before the Copyright Act of 1976 went into effect in 1978. 
The Copyright Act of 1976 created a static seventy-five-year term (dated from the date of publication) for anonymous works, pseudonymous works, and works made for hire. 
The extension term for works copyrighted before 1978 that had not already entered the public domain was increased from twenty-eight years to forty-seven years, giving a total term of seventy-five years. 
The [[Copyright Renewal Act of 1992]] {{USStatute|102|307|106|264|1992|06|26}} amended the 1976 Copyright Act, and affected works copyrighted between January 1, 1964 and December 31, 1977. Renewal registration for these works was made optional, and a second term was automatically secured.
In 1998 the [[Copyright Term Extension Act]] further extended copyright protection to the duration of the author's life plus seventy years for general copyrights and to ninety-five years from date of publication or 120 years from date of creation, whichever comes first, for works made for hire. 

==Divisibility of copyright==

The 1909 Copyright Act was confused in its discussion of the relationship between copyright in the collective work and that in the individual works.{{sfn|Leaffer|2010|loc=PT176}}
Under the 1909 Act a copyright could only be transferred to another owner in whole, and not in part.
Thus an author could not transfer the rights for their work to be published as part of a collective work without transferring all rights in their work.{{sfn|Fountain}}
''Goodis v. United Artists Television, Inc.'', 425 [[Federal Reporter|F.2d]] 397 concerned the rights of the author of the novel ''[[Dark Passage]]'', first published as a serial in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.
The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] held on 9 March 1970 that the doctrine of indivisibility could not wholly deprive an author of his copyright in a case like this.{{sfn|425 F. 2d 397 - Goodis v. United Artists Television}}

The doctrine of indivisibility was expressly eliminated in the Copyright Act of 1976.
Section 106 of the Act lists the exclusive rights that the copyright owner has in a copyrighted work, which are the rights of reproduction; preparation of derivative works; distribution; public performance; public display; and digital performance in sound recordings.
Each of these exclusive rights may be divided to any number of recipients, and each may be limited to a specified time or place.{{sfn|Fountain}}

==Property rights==

The compiler, or author of the collection, owns copyright in the expression he or she contributed, which is primarily the selection and arrangement of the separate contributions, but may include such things as a preface, advertisements, etc., that the collective author created.{{sfn|Barrett|2012|loc=PT449}}
The contributions remain the property of the authors by default, but the property may be passed to the owner of the collective work by a [[copyright transfer agreement]].
They may also obtain ownership of the contributions if they are [[Work for hire|works made for hire]].{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}
The Copyright Act of 1976 says a work is considered a "work made for hire" as either,

{{quote| (1) a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment; or (2) a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a [[collective work]], as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, as a translation, as a supplementary work, as a compilation, as an instructional text, as a test, as answer material for a test, or as an atlas, if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire. (17 U.S.C. § 101){{sfn|Works Made for Hire – US Copyright Office}} }}

It there is no contract transferring ownership and the contributions are not work for hire, the owner has the right to reproduce, distribute and revise the collective work, but does not have the rights to the individual contributions.{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}

==Classroom use==

Multiple copies of works for classroom use may be made subject to conditions that include "not more than one short poem, article, story, essay, or two excerpts may be copied from the same author, not more than three from the same collective work or periodical volume during one class term.{{sfn|DeGeeter|2004|p=158}}

==Websites==

The websites of daily or weekly magazines or journal such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' or ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' are collective works and qualify for group registration with the Copyright Office.
Electronic journals that are published one article at a time are not collective works.{{sfn|Fishman|2007|p=40}}
To defeat the "innocent infringer" rule{{efn|See [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act]]}}, a collective work website must contain a copyright notice for the work as a whole. 
It does not need to have a copyright notice for the individual works.
Advertisements are not covered by this notice, and require a separate notice to be protected.{{sfn|Fishman|2007|p=83}}
If a website contains material from the United States government, which is in the public domain, the copyright notice should indicate to readers which parts of the content are public domain and which are not.
If the notice does not do so it will be found invalid, and the innocent infringer defense may be used.{{sfn|Fishman|2007|p=85}}

''[[Metropolitan Regional Information System, Inc. v. American Home Realty Network, Inc.]]'' [722 F.3d 591] was a [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] case in which a court held that the copyright owner of a collective work such as an automated database was not required by a pre-suit [[copyright registration]] requirement to identify names of creators and titles of individual work. Also, clicking yes to the term of use and uploading a photograph, is sufficient to writing component in assignment of right under {{usc|17|204}}.{{sfn|Metro. Reg'l Info. Sys., Inc. v. Am. Home Realty Network}}

==Electronic reproduction==

The Supreme Court case of ''[[New York Times Co. v. Tasini]]'' (2001) concerned free-lance journalists who had been paid for their contributions to paper editions of newspapers and magazines, but their contracts had not covered digital rights for reproduction on CD-ROMs or publication on the Internet.
When the articles were distributed in electronic form a few years later, the court ruled that this did not constitute a revision of the work, because the articles could be accessed individually.{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}
The court also discussed how the work was presented and visible to the user on the [[LexisNexis|Lexis]] online periodical database. 
The databases "present articles to users clear of the context provided either by the original periodical editions or by any revision of those editions ... without the graphics, formatting, or other articles with which the article was initially published.{{sfn|McJohn|2006|p=134}}{{efn|The New York Times argued without success that it had the right to reproduce issues in Braille, in microform or translated into a foreign language, even though these versions would have a very different look and feel, so should have the right to reproduce issues electronically. The court disagreed.{{sfn|D'Agostino|2010|p=145}}
Another point that may be made in favor of the judgement is that the newspaper's editorials and opinion section are not shown along with the individual article, and these are essential parts of the collective work and communicate a political perspective with which the authors are associated. The authors may be instead associated in the online work with unwelcome discussion threads that cause them to lose credibility.{{sfn|D'Agostino|2010|p=144–145}} }}

In ''Faulkner v. National Geographic Enterprises Inc.'' (2005), a Court of Appeal ruled that an electronic version of a newspaper was a revision of the collective work if it reproduced the paper version identically, including advertisements and photographs.{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}
In the late 1990s [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] had begun publishing ''The Complete National Geographic'', a digital compilation of all the past issues of the magazine. 
It was then sued over copyright of the magazine as a collective work in ''[[Greenberg v. National Geographic]]'' and other cases, and temporarily withdrew the availability of the compilation. 
On June 30, 2008, the Eleventh Circuit held that National Geographic had the right to publish faithful copies of its print magazine electronically.
The ruling noted, 
{{blockquote|In the light of the Supreme Court’s holding in ''Tasini'' that the bedrock of any § 201(c) analysis is contextual fidelity to the original print publication as presented to, and perceivable by, the users of the revised version of the original publication, we agree with the Second Circuit in ''Faulkner'' and find that National Geographic is privileged to reproduce and distribute the CNG under the “revision” prong of § 201(c)."{{sfn|Greenberg v. National Geographic Society}} }}

An online database that contains copyrightable works may be considered a collective work, where the owner of the database has a "thin" copyright over the selection and arrangement of the works in the database. The individual works may be covered by separate copyrights.{{sfn|Fishman|2007|p=270}}

[[Andy Warhol]]'s '''''Cow Wallpaper''''' was the first in a series of wallpaper designs he created from the 1960s to the 1980s.

According to Warhol, the inspiration for the cow image came from art dealer [[Ivan Karp]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;Another time he said, 'Why don't you paint some cows, they're so wonderfully pastoral and such a durable image in the history of the arts.' (Ivan talked like this.) I don't know how 'pastoral' he expected me to make them, but when he saw the huge cow heads — bright pink on a bright yellow background — that I was going to have made into rolls of wallpaper, he was shocked. But after a moment he exploded with: 'They're ''super''-pastoral! They're ridiculous! They're blazingly bright and vulgar!' I mean, he loved those cows and for my next show we papered all the walls in the gallery with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Warhol |first1=Andy |last2=Hackett|first2=Pat|title=POPism: The Warhol 60s |date=1980|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=9780151730957|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xtI3AQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The show Warhol refers to is his April, 1966 show at the [[Leo_Castelli#Leo_Castelli_Gallery|Leo Castelli Gallery]], which consisted only of ''Cow Wallpaper'' in one room, and a second room with Warhol's silver helium-filled ''Clouds''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andy Warhol|url=https://www.castelligallery.com/artists/Warhol/warhol.html|website=Castelli Gallery|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian and critic [[Barbara Rose]] interpreted ''Cow Wallpaper'' as a commentary on the nature of art collecting and the character of the institutions where art is displayed.  In a review of Warhol's 1971 retrospective show at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney]], she observed that cows are a common subject of [[Genre painting|genre paintings]] that people display in their homes, and that the wallpaper made the Whitney look like "a boutique." She continued, "Of course the museum has been a boutique for a long time, and people have been treating paintings like wallpaper even longer. But Andy spells it out with his usual cruel clarity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rose|first1=Barbara|title=In Andy Warhol's Aluminum Foil, We Have All Been Reflected|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ij-_4jJ4oj8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|work=New York Magazine|date=31 May 1971|page=55|issn=0028-7369|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Delaware Children's Theatre''' ('''DCT''') is a community theatre in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], United States.  The theatre company occupies the historic '''New Century Club''' building.

==Theatre company==
Originally named the Children's Repertory Theatre of Wilmington, the organization began in 1973 with their first production of ''[[Pinocchio]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dechildrenstheatre.org/aboutdct/history.html|title=History
|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Delaware Children's Theatre|accessdate=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization relies on volunteers for all acting and nearly all support positions as a community theater.  To cover operating expenses, DCT sells tickets and receives state support through the Delaware Division of the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsdel.org/grants/grantawards2010.pdf|title=Delaware Division of the Arts Grant Awards: FY2010|last=|first=|year=2010|publisher=Delaware Division of the Arts|accessdate=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Century Club==&lt;!--This section is linked from other articles--&gt;
The Theatre occupies the historic New Century Club building. The organization constructed the building in 1893 and occupied it until 1975. The Delaware Dinner Theatre and Delaware Ballet Company then used the building until 1982 when DCT moved in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=83001336}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination Form|last=Briggs|first=Robert|date=January 1983|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Minerva Parker Nichols]] of Philadelphia, an early female architect, designed the [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] building with [[Palladian window]]s and a [[gambrel]] roof.  While serving partly as a clubhouse, it also held a theatre which was used for traveling shows as well as civic speakers, including future president [[Woodrow Wilson]] and birth control advocate [[Margaret Sanger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2294&amp;dat=19540124&amp;id=tswmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bgIGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1366,563399|title=New Century Club Celebrates Sixty-Fifth Anniversary|last=Ruston|first=Muriel|date=1954-01-24|publisher=Wilmington Sunday Star|accessdate=2010-01-31|at=Section 3, Page 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Delores E. Churchill''' is a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[artist]] of [[Haida people|Haida]] descent. She is a [[Weaver (occupation)|weaver]] of baskets, hats, robes, and other regalia, as well as leading revitalization efforts for [[Haida language|Haida]], her native language.

==Background==
Churchill was born in [[Masset]], [[Queen Charlotte Islands]], Canada in 1929.&lt;ref name="kenai"&gt;[http://www.artskenai.com/gallery_detail.asp?ID=208 Delores Churchill.] ''Kenai River Council on The Arts.'' 2003 (retrieved 5 Nov 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kfsk.org/2015/10/15/haida-master-weaver-delores-churchill-shares-her-story/|title=Haida master weaver Delores Churchill shares her story|last=15|first=Angela Denning {{!}} Oct|last2=2015|date=2015-10-15|website=KFSK|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a girl, she attended schools that forced her to speak English in place of her native tongue, a typical practice of that time period. She first studied traditional Haida weaving with her mother, [[Selina Peratrovich]], who is also a nationally recognized master weaver. She went on to study traditional [[Tsimshian]] weaving from masters [[Flora Matthew]] and [[Brenda White]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.wa.gov/folk-arts/master-artists/churchill-delores.shtml Folk Arts | Master Artist | Delores Churchill&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill further studied at the British Museum and relearned the six-strand weave.&lt;ref name="krbd.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.krbd.org/2017/05/05/delores-churchill-receives-lifetime-achievement-award/|title=Delores Churchill honored with Lifetime Achievement Award|last=5|first=Maria Dudzak {{!}} May|last2=2017|date=2017-05-05|website=KRBD|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; After retiring from a bookkeeping career and raising her family, Churchill turned her attention back to basketry at a time when Haida basket weaving was in serious decline as an art form among younger members of the tribe.&lt;ref name=kenai/&gt; She taught her niece, [[Lisa Telford]], traditional Haida basket weaving.

==Artwork==
Churchill is known for her utilitarian and ceremonial objects that often use spruce root, cedar bark, wool, and [[natural dye]]s. Some of her artwork is displayed at the [[Totem Heritage Center]] in [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]], [[Alaska]], where she has also taught courses in basketry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.city.ketchikan.ak.us/departments/museums/documents/InstructorBiosforweb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Haida language revitalization ==
As one of the few remaining native speakers of [[Haida language|Haida]], Churchill has fought to share her linguistic heritage. Canada and the United States both suppressed use of the Haida language, especially through forcing Native children to speak English in [[Indian residential schools|boarding schools]]. Churchill was forced by her teachers in the [[Canadian Indian residential school system|Canadian residential school]] she attended as a child to speak English and was punished for speaking her own language. Despite these challenges, Churchill has remained adamant in her desire to preserve her native language and frequently works with Haida children and assisted her daughter April Churchill's language revitalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Northern Northwest Coast Weavers |url=http://www.burkemuseum.org/static/baskets/artists/nnwc.html |publisher=Burke Museum |accessdate=11 July 2018 |date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honors and awards ==
Churchill is the recipient of numerous awards, including:
* National Heritage Fellowship Award, ''[[National Endowment for the Arts]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nea.gov/about/NEARTS/15-2007vol1/15p5churchill.html&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Energy Neutral Design''' is a Design of any type (Website, Multi-media, Architecture, Art, Music, Entertainment, etc.) that has the environment and low energy consumption practices in mind during all stages of planning and production.

Energy neutral design can also refer to environmentally powered electronics, where devices absorb or harvest energy from the immediate surroundings and transform it to the electricity they require for their operation.  One example of this is the [[Batteryless_radio]].  More recently wireless sensor networks and internet of things devices have featured energy neutral designs where light, heat, motion or other forms of energy are converted to electricity.

==Examples==
*[[Zero-energy building]]
*[[Energy efficiency in British housing]]
*[[Carbon footprint]]
*[[Low-carbon economy]]
*[[Live Earth]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11581">The '''Fontana Modern Masters''' was a series of pocket guides on writers, [[philosophy|philosophers]], and other thinkers and theorists who shaped the intellectual landscape of the twentieth century. The first five titles were published on 12 January 1970 by Fontana Books, the paperback imprint of [[William Collins (publisher)|William Collins &amp; Co]], and the series editor was [[Frank Kermode]] who was Professor of Modern [[English literature|English Literature]] at [[University College London]]. The books were very popular with students, who 'bought them by the handful' according to Kermode,&lt;ref&gt;Frank Kermode. ''Not Entitled: A Memoir''. London: [[HarperCollins]], 1996, p.224.&lt;/ref&gt; and they were instantly recognisable by their eye-catching covers, which featured brightly coloured abstract art and [[sans-serif]] [[typography]].

== Art as book covers ==
[[Image:CONOR CRUISE OBRIEN Camus 1970.jpg|thumb|''Camus'' by Conor Cruise O'Brien, published by Fontana Books in 1970. The cover shows a detail from an Op Art painting by Oliver Bevan ([[:Image:CONOR CRUISE OBRIEN Camus 1970.jpg|details]]).]]

The Fontana Modern Masters occupy a unique place in publishing history - not for their contents but their covers, which draw on the following developments in twentieth-century art and literature:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wire-frame.net/news.html#00007 James Pardey. 'The Shape of the Century'.] ''[[Eye (magazine)|Eye Magazine]]'', Winter 2009, pp.6-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/rwabristol/docs/rwa_art_autumn_2012_www/28?mode=window&amp;backgroundColor=%23222222 James Pardey. 'Oliver Bevan: In Search of Utopia'.] ''[[Royal West of England Academy|RWA Magazine]]'', Autumn 2012, pp.26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Twentieth-century [[geometric abstraction]], [[Color Field|colour-field painting]] and [[hard-edge painting]].
* [[Op art|Op Art]], and in particular the work of [[Victor Vasarely]].
* The English [[beatnik]] [[Brion Gysin|Brion Gysin's]] [[cut-up technique]] as popularized by [[William S. Burroughs|William Burroughs]].

The cover concept was the brainchild of Fontana's art director John Constable, who had been experimenting with a cover treatment based on cut-ups of ''[[The Mud Bath]]'', a key work of British geometric abstraction by the painter [[David Bomberg]]. However, a visit to the Grabowski Gallery in London introduced Constable to the work of [[Oliver Bevan]], a graduate of the [[Royal College of Art]] in 1964, whose optical and geometric paintings were influenced by Vasarely's Op Art. On seeing Bevan's work, Constable commissioned him to create the covers for the first ten Fontana Modern Masters, which Bevan painted as rectilinear arrangements of tesselating blocks. Each cover was thus a piece of abstract art, but as an incentive for readers to buy all ten books the covers could be arranged to create a larger, composite artwork. The 'set of ten' books appeared in 1970-71 but overran when ''Joyce'' was published with the same cover as ''Guevara'':

* ''[[Albert Camus|Camus]]'' by [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]], 1970
* ''[[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]]'' by [[John Lyons (linguist)|John Lyons]], 1970
* ''[[Frantz Fanon|Fanon]]'' by [[David Caute]], 1970
* ''[[Che Guevara|Guevara]]'' by [[Andrew Sinclair]], 1970
* ''[[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]]'' by [[Edmund Leach]], 1970
* ''[[György Lukács|Lukács]]'' by [[George Lichtheim]], 1970
* ''[[Herbert Marcuse|Marcuse]]'' by [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], 1970
* ''[[Marshall McLuhan|McLuhan]]'' by [[Jonathan Miller]], 1971
* ''[[George Orwell|Orwell]]'' by [[Raymond Williams]], 1971
* ''[[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'' by [[David Pears]], 1971
* ''[[James Joyce|Joyce]]'' by [[John Gross]], 1971

A second 'set of ten' featuring a new Bevan cut-up was published in 1971-73 but the inclusion of ''Joyce'' in the first 'set of ten' left this second set one book short:
* ''[[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'' by [[Richard Wollheim]], 1971
* ''[[Wilhelm Reich|Reich]]'' by [[Charles Rycroft]], 1971
* ''[[William Butler Yeats|Yeats]]'' by [[Denis Donoghue (academic)|Denis Donoghue]], 1971
* ''[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]]'' by [[George Woodcock]], 1972
* ''[[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'' by [[Robert Conquest]], 1972
* ''[[Norman Mailer|Mailer]]'' by [[Richard Poirier]], 1972
* ''[[Bertrand Russell|Russell]]'' by [[Alfred Jules Ayer|A J Ayer]], 1972
* ''[[Carl Jung|Jung]]'' by [[Anthony Storr]], 1973
* ''[[D. H. Lawrence|Lawrence]]'' by Frank Kermode, 1973

A third 'set of ten' featuring Bevan's kinetic ''Pyramid'' painting began to appear in 1973-74 but Constable left before the set was complete and his replacement, [[Mike Dempsey]], scrapped the set-of-ten incentive after eight books:
* ''[[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]]'' by [[Al Alvarez|A Alvarez]], 1973
* ''[[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'' by [[Jeremy Bernstein]], 1973
* ''[[R. D. Laing|Laing]]'' by [[Edgar Z. Friedenberg]], 1973
* ''[[Karl Popper|Popper]]'' by [[Bryan Magee]], 1973
* ''[[Franz Kafka|Kafka]]'' by [[Erich Heller]], 1974
* ''[[Le Corbusier]]'' by [[Stephen Gardiner (architect)|Stephen Gardiner]], 1974
* ''[[Marcel Proust|Proust]]'' by [[Roger Shattuck]], 1974
* ''[[Max Weber|Weber]]'' by Donald G MacRae, 1974

Dempsey switched the covers to a white background and commissioned a new artist James Lowe, whose cover art for the next eight books in 1975-76 was based on triangles: 
* ''[[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]]'' by [[Stephen Spender]], 1975
* ''[[Karl Marx|Marx]]'' by [[David McLellan (academic)|David McLellan]], 1975
* ''[[Ezra Pound|Pound]]'' by [[Donald Davie]], 1975
* ''[[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]]'' by [[Arthur Danto|Arthur C Danto]], 1975
* ''[[Antonin Artaud|Artaud]]'' by [[Martin Esslin]], 1976
* ''[[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]]'' by D E Moggridge, 1976
* ''[[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]]'' by [[Jonathan Culler]], 1976
* ''[[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'' by [[Charles Rosen]], 1976

Nine more books appeared in 1977-79 with cover art by James Lowe based on squares:
* ''[[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]'' by David McLellan, 1977
* ''[[Antonio Gramsci|Gramsci]]'' by [[James Joll]], 1977
* ''[[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]]'' by [[Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens|Anthony Giddens]], 1978
* ''[[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'' by [[George Steiner]], 1978
* ''[[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'' by [[J. P. Stern|J P Stern]], 1978
* ''[[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]]'' by [[Irving Howe]], 1978
* ''[[Melanie Klein|Klein]]'' by [[Hanna Segal]], 1979
* ''[[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov]]'' by [[Jeffrey Alan Gray|Jeffrey A Gray]], 1979
* ''[[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]'' by [[Margaret Boden|Margaret A Boden]], 1979

Dempsey left Fontana Books in 1979 but continued to oversee the Modern Masters series until a new art director, Patrick Mortimer, was appointed in 1980. Four more books followed under Mortimer with cover art by James Lowe based on circles:
* ''[[E. E. Evans-Pritchard|Evans-Pritchard]]'' by [[Mary Douglas]], 1980
* ''[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'' by Wilma George, 1982
* ''[[Roland Barthes|Barthes]]'' by [[Jonathan Culler]], 1983
* ''[[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]]'' by [[Martin Jay]], 1984

The cover concept was dropped after this and a new design was used that featured a portrait of the Modern Master as a line drawing or later a tinted photograph, and mixed serif and sans-serif typefaces, upright and italic fonts, block capitals, lowercase letters and faux handwriting. The design was used for reprints and six new titles: 
* ''[[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'' by [[José Guilherme Merquior|J G Merquior]], 1985
* ''[[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]]'' by [[Christopher Norris (critic)|Christopher Norris]], 1987
* ''[[Donald Winnicott|Winnicott]]'' by [[Adam Phillips (psychologist)|Adam Phillips]], 1988
* ''[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]'' by [[Malcolm Bowie]], 1991
* ''[[Hannah Arendt|Arendt]]'' by David Watson, 1992
* ''[[Isaiah Berlin|Berlin]]'' by [[John N. Gray|John Gray]], 1995

== Book covers as art ==
Fontana's use of art as book covers went full circle in 2003-05 when the British [[conceptual art]]ist [[Jamie Shovlin]] 'reproduced' the covers of the forty-eight Fontana Modern Masters from ''Camus'' to ''Barthes'' as a series of flawed paintings (the titles are missing and the colours have run) in watercolour and ink on paper, each measuring 28 x 19&amp;nbsp;cm. However, Shovlin also noticed ten forthcoming titles listed on the books' front endpapers which, for reasons unknown, had not been published:

* ''[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]]'' by [[Harold Rosenberg]]
* ''[[Buckminster Fuller|Fuller]]'' by [[Allan Temko]]
* ''[[Roman Jakobson|Jakobson]]'' by [[Thomas Sebeok|Thomas A Sebeok]]
* ''[[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'' by [[Lionel Trilling]]
* ''[[Thomas Mann|Mann]]'' by Lionel Trilling
* ''[[Maurice Merleau-Ponty|Merleau-Ponty]]'' by H P Dreyfus
* ''[[Joseph Needham|Needham]]'' by George Steiner
* ''[[Charles Scott Sherrington|Sherrington]]'' by Jonathan Miller
* ''[[Saul Steinberg|Steinberg]]'' by [[John Hollander]]
* ''Winnicott'' by [[Masud Khan]] (this was published with a different author, as listed in the previous section)

Shovlin then set out to paint these 'lost' titles and thus 'complete' the series. To do this he devised a 'Fontana Colour Chart' based on the covers of the published books, and a scoring system that - like his paintings - was deliberately flawed. Given these flaws, and those in Fontana's original series, the absence of any modern masters from the visual arts is notable,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fontanamodernmasters.org/07.html#Riflemaker Jamie Shovlin. ''Fontana Modern Masters''.] Riflemaker, London, 14 April - 28 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; since ''Matisse'' was one of four 'forthcoming titles' which Shovlin had apparently overlooked:

* ''[[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]]'' by [[Samuel Weber]]
* ''[[Erik Erikson|Erikson]]'' by [[Robert Jay Lifton|Robert Lifton]]
* ''[[Ho Chi Minh|Ho]]'' by [[David Halberstam]]
* ''[[Henri Matisse|Matisse]]'' by [[David Sylvester]]

''Benjamin'' and ''Matisse'' have since been included in a new series of seventeen large Fontana Modern Masters that Shovlin painted in 2011-12. These use a similar scoring system to his watercolours of 2003-05 and a new 'Acrylic Variations Colour Wheel'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fontanamodernmasters.org/07.html#HoV Jamie Shovlin. ''Various Arrangements''.] [[Haunch of Venison]], London, 18 April - 26 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings are acrylic on canvas and each measures 210 x 130&amp;nbsp;cm:

* ''Arendt by David Watson (Variation 1)''
* ''Benjamin by Samuel Weber (Variation 3)''
* ''Berlin by John Gray (Variation 1)''

[[File:Tom Clancy at Burns Library, Boston College.jpg|thumb|300px|The popular demand for [[Tom Clancy]]'s action novels exceeded his ability to write new books. As a result, his publisher hired ghostwriters to write novels in the Clancy style.]]

A '''ghostwriter''' is hired to write [[literature|literary]] or [[journalism|journalistic]] works, [[Public speaking|speeches]], or other texts that are officially credited to another person as the [[author]]. Celebrities, executives, participants in timely news stories, and political leaders often hire ghostwriters to draft or edit [[autobiography|autobiographies]], [[memoir]]s, magazine articles, or other written material. In music, ghostwriters are often used to write songs, lyrics, and instrumental pieces. Screenplay authors can also use ghostwriters to either [[script doctor|edit or rewrite their scripts]] to improve them. 

Usually, there is a confidentiality clause in the contract between the ghostwriter and the credited author that obligates the former to remain anonymous. Sometimes the ghostwriter  is acknowledged by the author or publisher for his or her writing services, euphemistically called a "researcher" or "research assistant", but often the ghostwriter is not credited.

Ghostwriting (or simply "ghosting") also occurs in other creative fields. Composers have long hired ghostwriters to help them to write musical pieces and songs; [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] is an example of a well-known composer who was paid to ghostwrite music for wealthy patrons. Ghosting also occurs in [[popular music]]. A pop music ghostwriter writes lyrics and a melody in the style of the credited musician. In [[hip hop]] music, the increasing use of ghostwriters by high-profile hip-hop stars has led to controversy.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28551924|title=The secret ghostwriters of Hip Hop|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the visual arts, it is not uncommon in either [[fine art]] or commercial art such as [[comics]] for a number of assistants to do work on a piece that is credited to a single artist.  However, when credit is established for the writer, the acknowledgement of their contribution is public domain and the writer in question would not be considered a ghostwriter.

==Overview==

A consultant or career-switcher may pay a ghostwriter to write a book on a topic in their professional area, to establish or enhance credibility as an 'expert' in their field. Public officials and [[politicians]] employ "correspondence officers" to respond to the large volume of official [[communication|correspondence]]. A number of papal [[encyclical]]s have been written by ghostwriters. A controversial and scientifically unethical practice is medical ghostwriting, where biotech or pharmaceutical companies pay professional writers to produce papers and then recruit (via a payment or as a perk) other scientists or physicians to attach their names to these articles before they are published in medical or scientific journals. Some university and college students hire ghostwriters from [[essay mill]]s to write entrance essays, term papers, theses, and dissertations. This is largely considered unethical unless the actual ghostwriting work is just light editing.

Ghostwriters are hired for numerous reasons. In many cases, celebrities or public figures do not have the time, discipline, or writing skills to write and research a several-hundred page autobiography or "how-to" book. Even if a celebrity or public figure has the writing skills to pen a short article, they may not know how to structure and edit a several-hundred page book so that it is captivating and well-paced. In other cases, publishers use ghostwriters to increase the number of books that can be published each year under the name of well-known, highly marketable authors, or to quickly release a topical book that ties in with a recent or upcoming newsworthy event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Quien no corre, vuela|url = http://www.zoomnews.es/40446/letras-y-tretas/quien-no-corre-vuela|website = ZoomNews|accessdate = 2015-11-14|language = es-ES|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015909/http://www.zoomnews.es/40446/letras-y-tretas/quien-no-corre-vuela|archivedate = 2015-11-17|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hrcraad.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The ghostwriter for [[Hillary Clinton]]'s memoirs received a $500,000 fee for collaborating with her.]]

Ghostwriters will often spend from several months to a full year researching, writing, and editing [[nonfiction]] and [[fiction]] works for a client, and they are paid based on a price per hour, per word or per page, with a flat fee, a percentage of the royalties of the sales, or some combination thereof. Some ghostwriters charge for articles "$4 per word and more depending on the complexity" of the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.certmag.com/read.php?in=344|title=Marketing Yourself via Ghostwriting|work=Certification Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Literary agent]] Madeleine Morel states that the average ghostwriter's advance for work for major book publishers is "between $15,000 and $75,000".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bookwritinginc.com/blog/what-is-ghostwriting-complete-guide-ghostwriting/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-02-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213080029/https://www.bookwritinginc.com/blog/what-is-ghostwriting-complete-guide-ghostwriting/ |archive-date=2018-02-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These benchmark prices are mirrored approximately in the film industry by the Writer's Guild, where a Minimum Basic Agreement gives a starting price for the screenplay writer of $37,073 (non-original screenplay, no treatment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contracts|publisher=[[Writer's Guild of America]]|url=http://www.wga.org/uploadedFiles/writers_resources/contracts/min2014.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331044042/http://www.wga.org/uploadedFiles/writers_resources/contracts/min2014.pdf|archivedate=2015-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the recent shift into the digital age (15–20% world market share of books by 2015) has brought some changes, by opening newer markets that bring their own opportunities for authors and writers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Bain.com|title=Publishing in the digital era|url=http://www.bain.com/Images/BB_Publishing_in_the_digital_era_4_11.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;—especially on the more affordable side of the ghostwriting business. One such market is the shorter book, best represented at the moment by Amazon's Kindle Singles imprint: texts of 30,000 words and under.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/sep/05/amazon-kindle-singles-short|title=The big short – why Amazon's Kindle Singles are the future|author=Julian Gough|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a length would have been much harder to sell before digital reader-technologies became widely available, but is now quite acceptable. Writers on the level of [[Ian McEwan]] have celebrated this recent change, mainly for artistic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/some-notes-on-the-novella|title=Some Notes on the Novella|author=Ian McEwan|date=29 October 2012|work=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence, the shorter format makes a project potentially more affordable for the client/author. Manhattan Literary, a ghostwriting company, states that "book projects on the shorter side, tailored to new markets like the Kindle Singles imprint and others (30,000–42,000 words) start at a cost of $15,000".&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/who-wrote-that-political-memoir-no-who-actually-wrote-it/2014/06/09/8e89ccae-f00a-11e3-9ebc-2ee6f81ed217_story.html|title=Who wrote that political memoir? No, who actually wrote it?|author=Paul Farhi|date=9 June 2014|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manhattanliterary.com/modules/wfchannel/index.php?pagenum=5 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515065007/http://www.manhattanliterary.com/modules/wfchannel/index.php?pagenum=5 |archivedate=2015-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; And this shorter book appears to be here to stay. It was once financially impractical for publishers to produce such novella-length texts (they would have to charge too much); but this new market is, by 2015, already substantial and has been projected to be a solid part of the future of book publishing.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; So, with its appearance the starting price for the professional book writer has come down by about half, but only if this shorter format makes sense for the client.

On the upper end of the spectrum, with celebrities that can all but guarantee a publisher large sales, the fees can be much higher. In 2001, the ''[[New York Times]]'' stated that the fee that the ghostwriter for [[Hillary Clinton]]'s memoirs will receive is probably about $500,000 of her book's $8 million advance, which "is near the top of flat fees paid to collaborators".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E3DF153AF93BA35752C0A9679C8B63 | work=The New York Times | first=David D. | last=Kirkpatrick | title=Media Talk; Mrs. Clinton Seeks Ghostwriter for Memoirs | date=8 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the consideration of different benchmarks in different countries. In Canada, The Writers' Union has established a minimum fee schedule for ghostwriting, starting at $40,000 for a 200–300 page book, paid at various stages of the drafting of the book. Research fees are an extra charge on top of this minimum fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.writersunion.ca/content/ghost-writing|title=Ghost Writing|work=writersunion.ca|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801172621/http://www.writersunion.ca/content/ghost-writing|archivedate=2012-08-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, the average fee for a confidential ghostwriting service is about $100 per page.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The Editorial Freelancers Association also suggests rates of 26 cents to 50 cents per word, which would be about $15,000 to $30,000 for a 250-page book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-efa.org/res/rates.php|title=EFA: Resources: Editorial Rates|author=Editorial Freelancers Association|work=the-efa.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119110817/http://www.the-efa.org/res/rates.php|archivedate=2013-01-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent availability also exists, of outsourcing many kinds of jobs, including ghostwriting, to [[Offshoring|offshore]] locations like India, China, and the Philippines where the customer can save money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-19476254|title=The globalisation of work - and people|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Outsource]]d ghostwriters, whose quality levels vary widely, complete 200-page books for fees ranging between $3000 and $5000, or $12–$18 per page. {{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The true tests of credibility—the writer's track record, and samples of his or her craft—become even more important in these instances, when the writer comes from a culture and first language that are entirely different from the client's.

In some cases, ghostwriters are allowed to share credit. For example, a common method is to put the client/author's name on a book cover as the main byline (by ''Author's Name'') and then to put the ghostwriter's name underneath it (as told to ''Ghostwriter's Name''). Sometimes this is done in lieu of pay or in order to decrease the amount of payment to the book ghostwriter for whom the credit has its own intrinsic value. Also, the ghostwriter can be cited as a coauthor of a book, or listed in the movie or film credits when having ghostwritten the script or screenplay for a film production.

For nonfiction books, the ghostwriter may be credited as a "contributor" or a "research assistant". In other cases, the ghostwriter receives no official credit for writing a book or article; in cases where the credited author or the [[publisher]] or both wish to conceal the ghostwriter's role, the ghostwriter may be asked to sign a [[nondisclosure contract]] that legally forbids any mention of the writer's role in a project. Some have made the distinction between 'author' and 'writer,' as ghostwriter Kevin Anderson explains in a ''[[Washington Post]]'' interview: "A ghostwriter is an interpreter and a translator, not an author, which is why our clients deserve full credit for authoring their books."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

==Types==

===Nonfiction===
Ghostwriters are widely used by celebrities and public figures who wish to publish their autobiographies or memoirs. The degree of involvement of the ghostwriter in nonfiction writing projects ranges from minor to substantial. Various sources explain the role of the ghostwriter and how competent writers can get this kind of work. In some cases, a ghostwriter may be called in just to clean up, edit, and polish a rough draft of an autobiography or a "how-to" book. In other cases, the ghostwriter will write an entire book or article based on information, stories, notes, an outline, or interview sessions with the celebrity or public figure. The credited author also indicates to the ghostwriter what type of style, tone, or "voice" they want in the book.

In some cases, such as with some "how-to" books, diet guides, or cookbooks, a book will be entirely written by a ghostwriter, and the celebrity (e.g., a well-known musician or sports star) will be credited as author. Publishing companies use this strategy to increase the marketability of a book by associating it with a celebrity or well-known figure. In several countries before elections, candidates commission ghostwriters to produce autobiographies for them so as to gain visibility and exposure. Two of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s books are almost entirely credited to ghostwriters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2478/did-john-f-kennedy-really-write-profiles-in-courage|title=The Straight Dope: Did John F. Kennedy really write "Profiles in Courage?"|work=straightdope.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Trump]]'s famous [[Trump: The Art of the Deal|autobiography]] was produced by a ghostwriter.&lt;ref name="trump"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all|title=Donald Trump’s Ghostwriter Tells All|last=Mayer|first=Jane|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=July 25, 2016|accessdate=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of Hillary Clinton's books were also produced by ghost writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/who-wrote-that-political-memoir-no-who-actually-wrote-it/2014/06/09/8e89ccae-f00a-11e3-9ebc-2ee6f81ed217_story.html|title=Who wrote that political memoir? No, who actually wrote it?|work=washingtonpost.com|date=June 9, 2014|accessdate=September 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A consultant or career-switcher may pay to have a book ghostwritten on a topic in their professional area, to establish or enhance their credibility as an 'expert' in their field. For example, a successful salesperson hoping to become a motivational speaker on selling may pay a ghostwriter to write a book on sales techniques. Often this type of book is published by a [[self-publishing press]] (or "[[vanity press]]"), which means that the author is paying to have the book published. This type of book is typically given away to prospective clients as a promotional tool, rather than being sold in bookstores.

===Fiction===
Ghostwriters are employed by fiction publishers for several reasons. In some cases, publishers use ghostwriters to increase the number of books that can be published each year by a well-known, highly marketable author. Ghostwriters are mostly used to pen fiction works for well-known "name" authors in genres such as detective fiction, mysteries, and teen fiction.

Additionally, publishers use ghostwriters to write new books for established series where the 'author' is a [[pseudonym]]. For example, the purported authors of the [[Nancy Drew]] and [[Hardy Boys]] mysteries, "[[Carolyn Keene]]" and "[[Franklin W. Dixon]]", respectively, are actually pseudonyms for a series of ghostwriters who write books in the same style using a template of basic information about the book's characters and their fictional universe (names, dates, speech patterns), and about the tone and style that are expected in the book (for more information, see the articles on [[pseudonym]]s or [[pen names]]). In addition, ghostwriters are often given copies of several of the previous books in the series to help them match the style.

The estate of romance novelist [[V. C. Andrews]] hired ghostwriter [[Andrew Neiderman]] to continue writing novels after her death, under her name and in a similar style to her original works. Many of action writer [[Tom Clancy]]'s books from the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] bear the names of two people on their covers, with Clancy's name in larger print and the other author's name in smaller print. Various books bearing Clancy's name were written by different authors under the same pseudonym. The first two books in the ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell]]'' franchise were written by [[Raymond Benson]] under the pseudonym [[David Michaels (author)|David Michaels]].

Sometimes famous authors will ghostwrite for other celebrities as well, such as when [[H. P. Lovecraft]] ghostwrote "Imprisoned with the Pharaohs" (also known as "Under the Pyramids") for [[Harry Houdini]] in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in the 1920s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

===Religious===
A number of papal [[encyclical]]s have been written by ghostwriters. ''[[Pascendi]]'', for instance, was written by Joseph Lemius (1860–1923), the procurator in Rome of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=015XHt7sAm0C&amp;pg=PA27 |title=Catholicism Contending with Modernity|work=google.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1938, [[Pius XI]] summoned [[United States|American]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[John LaFarge, Jr.|John La Farge]], who began to prepare a draft of ''[[Humani generis unitas]]'', which LaFarge and two other Jesuits—Gustav Gundlach and Gustave Desbuquois&lt;ref name="bailey"&gt;Richard G. Bailey. August 2001. "[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3686/is_200108/ai_n8969487 The Hidden Encyclical of Pius XI]." ''Canadian Journal of History''.&lt;/ref&gt;—on in Paris; the draft was approximately 100 pages long.&lt;ref name="chronicle"&gt;The Holocaust Chronicle. 2002. "[http://www.holocaustchronicle.org/StaticPages/112.html 1937: Quiet before the Storm]." p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Jesuit translated the draft encyclical into Latin, presenting it to [[Wlodimir Ledóchowski]], then the General of the Society of Jesus who had chosen Gundlach and Desbuquois for the project.&lt;ref name="bailey"/&gt; The draft encyclical was delivered to the Vatican in September 1938.&lt;ref name="bailey"/&gt; [[Sebastian Tromp]], a Dutch Jesuit, a solid [[Thomism|Thomist]] theologian and close to Pope [[Pius XII]], is considered to be the main ghostwriter of ''[[Mystici corporis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra von Teuffenbach ''Konzilstagebuch Sebastian Tromp SJ mit Erläuterungen and Akten aus der Arbeit der Theologischen Kommission'', 2006, Editrice Pontificia Università Gregoriana {{ISBN|978-88-7839-057-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic===
There are ghostwriting companies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/apr/03/academic-proofreading-write-essays-universities-students-ethics|title=Academic ghostwriting: to what extent is it haunting higher education?|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berliner-ghostwriter.de|title=Ghostwriting in Berlin|work=Berliner Zeitung}}&lt;/ref&gt; and freelancers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/125329/|title=The Shadow Scholar|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; that sell entrance essays, term papers, theses and dissertations to students. Such services are sometimes offered by what is referred to as [[essay mill]]s and frequently transacted through online interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Cheating-Goes-Global-as-Essay/32817/|title=Cheating Goes Global as Essay Mills Multiply|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being considered unethical and leading to repercussions if detected by universities,&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11532848/1700-for-a-dissertation-but-whats-the-real-cost-of-plagiarism.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Josie | last=Gurney-Read | title=£1,700 For A Dissertation, But What's The Real Cost Of Plagiarism? | date=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; academic ghostwriting does not represent illegal activity in the United States and United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/09/unemployed-professor-texas-tech_n_1412585.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Unemployed For Years, Professor Turns To Ghostwriting For Students | date=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although academic ghostwriting involves the sale of academic texts that are written on demand, it cannot be equated with [[plagiarism]], since it does not involve an undisclosed appropriation of existing texts. As opposed to cases of [[plagiarism]] that stem from a [[copy-and-paste]] reuse of previous work, essays and assignments that are obtained through ghostwriting services as a rule have the originality of their text confirmed by [[plagiarism detection]] software packages or online services that are widely used by universities.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;

Universities have developed strategies to combat this type of academic services, which can be associated with [[academic fraud]], that are offered to students and researchers. Some universities allow professors to give students [[oral examination]]s on papers which a professor believes to be 'ghostwritten.’ If the student is unfamiliar with the content of an essay that he or she has submitted, then the student can be charged with [[academic fraud]].

===Medical===
{{Main article|Medical ghostwriter}}
With medical ghostwriting, [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]] companies pay professional writers to produce papers and then pay other scientists or physicians to attach their names to these papers before they are published in medical or scientific journals. Medical ghostwriting has been criticized by a variety of professional organizations&lt;ref name="wame"&gt;{{cite journal |author=World Association of Medical Editors |year=2005 |title=Ghost writing initiated by commercial companies |journal=[[Journal of General Internal Medicine|J Gen Intern Med]] |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=549 |doi=10.1111/j.1525-1497.2005.41015.x |pmc=1490135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rennie |first=D. |last2=Flanagin |first2=A. |year=1994 |title=Authorship!

[[medical writing|Professional medical writers]] can write papers without being listed as authors of the paper and without being considered ghostwriters, provided their role is acknowledged. The [[European Medical Writers Association]] have published guidelines which aim to ensure professional medical writers carry out this role in an ethical and responsible manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jacobs |first=A. |last2=Wager |first2=E. |title=European Medical Writers Association (EMWA) guidelines on the role of medical writers in developing peer-reviewed publications |journal=[[Current Medical Research and Opinion|Curr Med Res Opin]] |year=2005 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=317–321 |doi=10.1185/030079905x25578 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of properly acknowledged medical writers is accepted as legitimate by organisations such as the World Association of Medical Editors&lt;ref name="wame"/&gt; and the ''[[British Medical Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resources.bmj.com/bmj/authors/article-submission/article-requirements|title=Resources for authors|work=bmj.com|access-date=2008-01-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222214144/http://resources.bmj.com/bmj/authors/article-submission/article-requirements|archive-date=2008-02-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, professional medical writers' expertise in presenting scientific data may be of benefit in producing better quality papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schultz |first=H.

===Website===
{{expand section|date=December 2010}}
Some websites, including [[blogs]], are ghostwritten, because not all authors have the [[information technology]] skills or the time to dedicate to running a website. Nonetheless, the style, tone and content is modeled on that of the credited author. Many website ghostwriters are [[freelance]] but some are [[freelancer]]s who work under [[employment contract|contract]], as with [[radio presenter]]s and [[television presenter]]s.
Occasionally [[Pseudonym#Literary pen names|a "house pseudonym", or collective name]] is used by the author of the website.

Some celebrities, [[Chief executive officer|CEOs]], or public figures set up blog websites—sometimes as a marketing, public relations, or lobbying tool. However, since these individuals are typically too busy to write their blog posts, they hire discreet ghostwriters to post to the blog under the celebrity or CEO's name. As with nonfiction ghostwriting, the blog ghostwriter models their writing style, content and tone on that of the credited author.  This goes for social media as well.  Many public figures have ghostwriters at least partially handle their [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] accounts, among others.&lt;ref name="PC World"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2048479/whos-actually-writing-your-favorite-celebritys-tweets-.html|title=Who's actually writing your favorite celebrity's tweets?|author=Evan Dashevsky|date=16 December 2013|work=PC World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===

====Classical music and film scores====
[[File:Martini bologna mozart 1777.jpg|thumb|upright|The Classical era composer [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] was paid to ghostwrite music for wealthy patrons who wished to give the impression that they were gifted composers.]]
[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] is an example of a well-known composer who was paid to ghostwrite music for wealthy patrons. More recently, composers such as the UK-based Patric Standford (born in 1939) have ghostwritten for symphonic recordings and films such as the Rod McKuen Cello Concerto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impulse-music.co.uk/standford.htm|title=Patric Standford|work=impulse-music.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film industry, a music ghostwriter is a "person who composes music for another composer but is not credited on the cue sheet or in the final product in any way." The practice is considered one of the "dirty little secrets of the film and television music business" that is considered unethical,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicmag.com/kb/glossary.php|title=Film &amp; TV Music Knowledgebase :: Glossary of Film and TV Music Terms|work=filmmusicmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has been common since the early stages of the film industry. In the early years of film, [[David Raksin]] worked as music ghostwriter and [[Orchestration|orchestrator]] for [[Charlie Chaplin]]; even though Chaplin was credited as the score writer, he was considered to be a "hummer" (pejorative film industry slang for a person who purports to be a film score composer but who in fact only gives a general idea of the melodies to a ghostwriter).

The practice is also common in television, as composers listed on cue sheets are entitled to music royalties every time an episode or theme score appears on television. A 1998 investigation by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' revealed that it was especially prevalent among animation companies such as [[Saban Entertainment]], [[DiC Entertainment|DiC]], [[Ruby-Spears Productions]] and [[Hanna-Barbera]], which often listed company executives as musicians for the purpose of royalties.&lt;ref&gt;"Composers say they're paupers in royalty game" - ''The Hollywood Reporter'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Several composers later filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Saban Entertainment president [[Haim Saban]], for allegedly taking ownership and credit for their musical compositions.

====Popular music====
Musical ghostwriting also occurs in [[popular music]]. When a record company wants to market an inexperienced young singer as a [[singer-songwriter]], or help a veteran bandleader coping with writer's block (or a lack of motivation to finish the next album), an experienced songwriter may be discreetly brought in to help.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} In other cases, a ghostwriter writes lyrics and a melody in the style of the credited musician, with little or no input from the credited musician. A ghostwriter providing this type of service may be thanked, without reference to the service provided, in the album credits, or they may be a true 'ghost', with no acknowledgement in the album.

Legal disputes have arisen hiwhen musical ghostwriters have tried to claim royalties, when an allegedly ghostwritten song becomes a money-making hit. In 1987, Darryl Neudorf was asked to work on a project for [[Nettwerk Productions]] involving a newly signed artist in their repertoire named [[Sarah McLachlan]]. This recording, the album ''[[Touch (Sarah McLachlan album)|Touch]]'', resulted in garnering the interest of [[Arista Records]]. She signed a multi-album contract with them and two of the songs that Neudorf worked on with her became commercial hits in [[Canada]]. In 1991, Neudorf was invited back to work with McLachlan on her second album, ''[[Solace (Sarah McLachlan album)|Solace]]''. In 1993, he filed a lawsuit against McLachlan and her label, [[Nettwerk]], alleging that he had made a significant and uncredited contribution to the songwriting on ''Touch'', and alleging that he wasn't paid properly for work done on ''Solace''. The judge in this suit eventually ruled in McLachlan's favor on the songs; though Neudorf may have contributed to the [[songwriting]], neither regarded each other as joint authors. The judge ruled in Neudorf's favour on the payment issue.

[[File:Chuck D. Slakthuset i Malmö 1991.jpg|thumb|250px|left|upright|[[Chuck D]] of [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] has offered a more positive view of ghostwriting in hip hop.]]
In [[hip hop music]], the increasing use of ghostwriters by high-profile hip hop stars has led to controversy. Critics view the increasing use of hip hop ghostwriters as the "perversion of hip-hop by commerce." This is because of the limiting definition of "rapping" as "...about you expressing yourself through your own words, not someone else’s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gelfmagazine.com/archives/hiphops_ghostwriters.php|title=Gelf Magazine Hip-Hop's Ghostwriters|work=gelfmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chuck D]] of [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] thinks this point of view is mistaken because "...not everyone is equipped to be a lyricist and not everyone is equipped to be a vocalist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Books of Rhymes: The Poetics of Hip Hop|first=Adam|last=Bradley|page=153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkGXXDZsFHcC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=book+of+rhymes+the+poetics+of+hip+hop+ghostwriter&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TBx9S8aMaM&amp;sig=wUcAYQdgCno2j58a7dBgz-93IT8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=InOiS6qhNMmUtgf34aTuCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CA0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He points out that creating a rap song may require multiple talents. [[Frank Ocean]] started his career as a ghostwriter for artists such as [[Justin Bieber]], [[Damienn Jones]], [[John Legend]] and [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]].

{{cquote|The practice of ghostwriting is one of rap's biggest taboos, and yet many of its greatest hits were ghostwritten. So who are Hip Hop's ghostwriters and what place do they have in a style of music built on speaking from the heart? Not all singers are songwriters&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;}}
Currently in hip-hop, the credit given to ghostwriters varies: "silent pens might sign confidentiality clauses, appear obliquely in the liner notes, or discuss their participation freely." In some cases, liner notes credit individuals for "vocal arrangement", which may be a euphemism for ghostwriting. In the early 2010s, hip-hop ghostwriting services like [[Rap Rebirth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/07/03/137559845/no-flow-rap-rebirth-can-help|title=Stamberg Raps! And Other Tales From A Hip-Hop Ghostwriter|date=2 July 2011|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; have appeared online, which provide recording artists who wish to purchase ghostwritten rhymes a greater degree of anonymity.

===Visual art===
Ghost-authorship also applies to the visual arts, most commonly paintings. The extent of the master artist's contribution varies widely, as little as composition adjustments and corrective brush strokes, or as much as entire works. A common practice is use of the art instruction class milieu in which the master artist makes significant contributions to the work of the student who then signs that work as his or her own. Services addressing complete works have historically been highly confidential. Less prevalent are advertised commercial services which may use the term "vanity artwork" as suggestive of "vanity publishing".
{{Clear}}

===As blacklisting countermeasure===
In countries where the freedom of speech is not upheld and authors that have somehow displeased the ruling regime are "blacklisted" (i.e. forbidden from having their works published), the blacklisted authors or composers may ghostwrite material for other authors or composers who are in the good graces of the regime.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Some blacklisted communist sympathisers have won [[Academy Awards]], for example:

* [[Carl Foreman]] and [[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]] for ''[[Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' (credited to [[Pierre Boulle]], who wrote [[The Bridge over the River Kwai|the novel]]).
* [[Dalton Trumbo]] for ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' (credited to [[Ian McLellan Hunter]]).

'''''History's Mysteries''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[documentary television series]] that aired on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]].

==Overview==

The 154 [[episode]]s of the series were produced from 1998-2006{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. Each season consisted of 12 to 14 one-hour episodes that focused on [[historical]] events or subjects considered to be mysterious by the general public. Episodes typically begin with Kent giving a broad overview of the subject followed by what is accepted as a common explanation. During the main segments, experts on both sides of the issue present their evidence and opinions. Before commercial breaks, Kent would give the audience bits of trivia relating to the subject; episodes also included a timeline which would give important events occurring around the time of the events discussed in the show.

Subjects covered on the show ranged from the beginning of [[human history]] to modern subjects such as [[Ilich Ramírez Sánchez|Carlos the Jackal]], [[The Amityville Horror]], and [[Area 51]], as well as [[conspiracy (political)|political conspiracies]] and [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] such as [[MK ULTRA]] and the [[JFK Assassination]]. Common aspects of history covered on the show include [[religion]], [[crime]], the [[supernatural]], [[archaeology]], [[mythology]], and [[folklore]].

Some episodes of the show were repackaged as part of a series called ''Incredible But True?'', which aired episodes of ''History's Mysteries'' as well as other shows (including ''In Search of History'' and ''UFO Files'', also narrated by Ackroyd). The show's last episodes were an anthology of clips from previous episodes (such as ''Mysteries of the High Seas'').

Although new episodes are no longer being produced, re-runs of ''History's Mysteries'' are regularly shown on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]. Additionally, they are available on [[DVD]].

'''''Holyday''''', later also known as '''''The Picnic''''', is an oil painting by French painter [[James Tissot]]  (1836–1902),  painted in 1876. Tissot moved to England in the year 1871, when he was thirty five  years old and settled there.  Before moving to London, Tissot  was a successful painter of Paris society.

It is {{convert|30|by|39|in|cm|}} in size. The painting shows a group of elegantly dressed men and women during a picnic at the  pond in the painter's garden.  The painting is characterized by the attention to detail and vivid colours. ''Holyday'' is held in London's [[Tate Gallery]].

== Description==
''Holyday'' was painted in the back garden of Tissot's London home, near the [[Lord's Cricket Ground]]. Autumn is coming, the leaves of the large chestnut tree are changing color, but the rest of the vegetation is still green and luxurious. The low sun shines a bright afternoon light on the scene. On the right is the painter's wife, Kathleen Newton, who appears to avert her eyes from the scene. The men in the painting belong to the well-known ''[[I Zingari]]'' cricket club, judging by their yellow, red and black hats. The women are overdressed, one of Tissot's idiosyncrasies. The atmosphere is sensual and relaxed and demonstrates a British sense of superiority. &lt;!-- ?? --&gt;

[[File:James Tissot - La Partie carrée.jpg|thumb|250px|''La Partie carrée'', 1876.]] 
Stylistically, ''Holyday'' is striking because of its crystal-clear representation. The work is hyperrealistic and greatly detailed, with sparkling colors. The focus on daily scenes comes from [[Impressionism]], which was ''en vogue'' in the Paris of those days. The influence of Manet can be recognized, also in the choice of subject, reminiscent of his ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' (The Luncheon on the Grass). However, ''Holyday'' does not provoke but is suffused with a British conservatism.

== History==
Tissot's ''Holyday'' was shown in 1877 in London's [[Grosvenor Gallery]] as a pendant for ''[[:File:Tissot a-convalescent.jpg|A Convalescent]]'', which was also painted by Tissot in his yard. He made studies for both paintings in a single sketchbook. He probably intended the two to be a [[diptych]], though they were quickly separated when sold and never exhibited together afterward. ''A Convalescent'' is in the [[Manchester Art Gallery]]; ''Holyday'' was acquired by the [[Tate Gallery]] in 1928.

'''''How Music Works''''' is a non-fiction book by [[David Byrne]], a musician, writer, and public figure best known for his work with the group [[Talking Heads]]. He discusses the form and influence of music in a non-linear narrative fashion, using a variety of experiences from his career to create something part [[autobiography]] and part [[music theory]]. The book was published through [[McSweeney's]] on September 12, 2012, and was named as one of [[Amazon.com]]'s "Best Books of the Month" in that same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000829021|title=Best Books of the Month: September 2012|accessdate=November 3, 2012|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=keens/&gt; It has received mainly positive reviews.&lt;ref name=keens/&gt;&lt;ref name=club/&gt;&lt;ref name=kirk/&gt;&lt;ref name=post/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Contents==
[[File:Talking Heads band3.jpg|thumb|Talking Heads performing at [[Horseshoe Tavern]] in [[Toronto]] in 1978.]]

The book, despite being non-fiction, has a highly non-linear structure with manual-like information, elements of Byrne's [[autobiography]], and anthropological data on [[music theory]] all intermixed, each chapter able to stand alone. Byrne looks at the influence of music, even in such subtle forms as birdsongs, from a rational perspective that eschews [[romanticism]].&lt;ref name=keens/&gt; Overall, he writes that no music "is aimed exclusively at either the body or the head", with complex human beings interacting with it on different levels.&lt;ref name=club/&gt;

He discusses his career with [[Talking Heads]], detailing many points of background for their music. He describes how the lyrics to the 1980 song "[[Once in a Lifetime (Talking Heads song)|Once in a Lifetime]]" drew inspiration from a recording of a preacher as well as how the oversize suits worn in their [[concert film]] ''[[Stop Making Sense]]'' drew inspiration from ancient Japanese theatre.&lt;ref name=keens/&gt; Byrne avoids bringing back up the personality conflicts leading to the band's demise, and he instead goes through their history, [[Talking Heads discography|album by album]], to detail his views on performances versus recordings as well as the effects of money and fame. In particular, he spends a chapter on the [[CBGB]] [[nightclub]] and the underlying conditions that supported the development of new, avant-garde artists such as [[Patti Smith]], [[the Ramones]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], and others besides his own band.&lt;ref name=kirk&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/david-byrne/how-music-works/|publisher=''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''|accessdate=November 3, 2012|title=HOW MUSIC WORKS|date=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byrne writes,
{{quote|"I’ve made money, and I’ve been ripped off... I’ve had creative freedom, and I’ve been pressured to make hits. I have dealt with diva behavior from crazy musicians, and I have seen genius records by wonderful artists get completely ignored... If you think success in the world of music is determined by the number of records sold, or the size of your house or bank account, then I’m not the expert for you. I am more interested in how people can manage a whole lifetime in music."&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinion/how-music-works-by-david-byrne/2012/09/22/341d210e-fb73-11e1-b2af-1f7d12fe907a_story.html|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|title="How Music Works" by David Byrne|date=September 22, 2012|author=[[Tim Page (music critic)|Tim Page]]|accessdate=November 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reviews==
A supportive review ran in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', with Oliver Keens stating that "David Byrne deserves great praise". Keens referred to the book as "as accessible as pop yet able to posit deep and startlingly original thoughts and discoveries in almost every paragraph", and he added that "this book will make you hear music in a different way." He remarked as well that "Talking Heads fans will find much to savour" and that "Byrne shows not just how music works, but how music publishing should work too."&lt;ref name=keens&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/artsandentertainmentbooksreview/9573776/How-Music-Works-by-David-Byrne-review.html|title=How Music Works by David Byrne: review|date=1 October 2012|accessdate=3 November 2012|first=Oliver|last=Keens|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The A.V. Club]]'' also published a positive review. Critic Jason Heller remarked that "joy—of singing and playing, of thinking and dancing, of listening and wondering—renders almost every page a song." In addition, he wrote, "Byrne’s knack for paradox and passion carries his erratic narrative."&lt;ref name=club&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/david-byrne-how-music-works,84993/|first=Jason|last=Heller|date=September 17, 2012|accessdate=November 3, 2012|publisher=''[[The A.V. Club]]''|title=David Byrne: How Music Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Washington Post]]'' critic [[Tim Page (critic)|Tim Page]] commented, "This is a decidedly generous book—welcoming, informal, digressive, full of ideas and intelligence—and one has the pleasant sense that Byrne is speaking directly to the reader, sharing a few confidences he has picked up over the years." Stating that "Byrne has plenty of smart things to say about pop music", Page lauded the "ambitious" work.&lt;ref name=post/&gt; ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' praised the book as "a supremely intelligent, superbly written dissection of music as an art form and way of life." The magazine stated in addition that "anyone at all interested in music will learn a lot from this book."&lt;ref name=kirk/&gt;

On the other hand, for ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Dwight Garner (critic)|Dwight Garner]], the book is "a roll of mental wallpaper, a textbook for a survey course you didn’t mean to sign up for. It drifts between music history, sonic anthropology, mild biographical asides, broad pop theory and grandfatherly financial and artistic advice. It’s all the things Mr. Byrne’s twitchy and alienated music with Talking Heads never was: genial, well-meaning, as forgettable as a real estate agent’s handshake." &lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/books/how-music-works-by-david-byrne.html?_r=0|first=Dwight|last=Garner|date=September 12, 2012|accessdate=February 23, 2013|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|title=A Talking Head Has Something to Say. ‘How Music Works,’ by David Byrne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Khaled Akil was born in [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]],&lt;ref name="AJ"&gt;{{cite news|title=Artist Khaled Akil imagines Pokémon Go in ravaged Syria|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/07/artist-khaled-akil-imagines-pokmon-ravaged-syria-160722172024059.html|agency=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a family with a long history of artistic and political influence. His father is the renowned painter Youssef Akil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.janetradyfineart.com/artist/Khaled_Akil/biography/|website=janetradyfineart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His great maternal grandfather is the Syrian author and historical figure [[Abd al-Rahman al-Kawakibi]].

Khaled’s first exhibition was held in 2009, when at the time he was completing his bachelor's degree in Law.&lt;ref name=NYTIMES /&gt; His experience in law, politics and human rights played a major role in his artistic development and projections. Most of his works deal with topics related to the social, political, and religious discrepancies he witnessed around the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PHOTOGRAPHY. BEHIND SYRIA’S WAR|url=http://www.freearabs.com/index.php/photo-gallery-page-art/jb-span-photography-jb-span-behind-syria-s-war#!1|website=freearabs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, he held a solo exhibition “The Legend of Death”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAREWELL IS NOT GOOD-BYE|url=http://www.mantlethought.org/arts-and-culture/farewell-not-good-bye|website=mantlethought.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Istanbul, where he resides today&lt;ref name="Vice"&gt;{{cite web|title=You Need to Be Looking at 'Pokémon Go in Syria'|url=http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/pokemon-go-in-syria-photographs-isis|website=The Creator Project.Vice}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the escalation of the war in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Middle East's managing editor caught up with celebrated Syrian artist Khaled Akil who currently resides in Istanbul. |url=http://www.yourmiddleeast.com/features/qa-with-Syrian-artist-khaled-akil_15437 |website=yourmiddleeast.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021030126/http://www.yourmiddleeast.com/features/qa-with-syrian-artist-khaled-akil_15437 |archivedate=2015-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technic ==
His work is a hybrid of photography and painting, with a digital final product.  various layers, created in direct relation with the photographic work and the issue presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INTERVIEW: KHALED AKIL|url=http://www.artfridge.de/2014/02/interview-with-khaled-akil.html|website=artfridge.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What one sees when looking into Akil's images is a dual universe wherein creatures and symbols merge with the visual fragments of war and abandonment.

Khaled Akil subjects his original photographs to countless layers of manual intervention that ultimately result in digital prints. With their mixture of photography, painting, and sometimes Arabic calligraphy, the dense surfaces of the works make them expressive and strongly palpable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6075">A '''line producer''' is a type of [[film producer]] who is the key manager during daily operations of a [[feature film]], [[Television advertisement|advertisement film]], [[television film]], or an [[episode]] of a [[TV program]]. A line producer usually works on one film at a time.&lt;ref name="Film Connection Film Institute"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Importance of a Line Producer|url=http://www.filmconnection.com/reference-library/film-entrepreneurs/importance-of-a-line-producer|accessdate = March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are responsible for [[human resources]] and handling any problems that come up during production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A producer who is responsible for managing every person and issue during the making of a film. Line producers only work on one film at a time|url=https://www.imdb.com/glossary/L|accessdate = March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
According to [[Producers Guild of America]] (PGA) guidelines, the Line Producer is the individual who reports directly to the individual(s) receiving "Produced By" credit on the theatrical motion picture and is the single individual who has the primary responsibility for the logistics of the production, from pre-production through completion of production; all Department Heads report to the Line Producer.&lt;ref name="Discovery"&gt;{{cite web|title=Producer's Code of Credits|url=http://www.producersguild.org/?coc_tmp_2|publisher=Producers Guild of America|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The line producer functions like a [[chief operations officer]] in running the production company. During pre-production, responsibilities include supervising the assembly of the shooting company, recruitment of key personnel and services, and production organization for how to shoot the script and transform it into a movie.  The line producer plans start dates for everyone and everything, and monitors the budget in the lead up to picture. Film production generally follows a rigorous schedule. The line producer facilitates casting, [[location scouting]], set building and decorating, offices and stages, wardrobe, props, stunts, physical and visual effects, camera, lighting, rigging, transportation, cast, crew and union relations, travel, cast and crew accommodation, contracting of legal permissions and agreements, safety and risk management, prep and shooting schedule. In short, the line producer oversees the joint planning, negotiations, implementation and accounting for production.

In the studio system, the line producer reports to the studio and typically liaises with key executives of production divisions inside the studio such as physical production, legal, labor relations, insurance, and finance. The line producer supports the [[Director (film)|director]]'s vision and direct influence on the creative expression or narrative of the film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|title=A line producer is basically there to make the director's vision achievable.|url=http://www.creativeskillset.org/film/stories/development/article_3400_1.asp|accessdate = March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it could be argued that, through a line producer's ability to influence aspects of the film, like allocation of resources to certain departments, they can change important aspects of the film that have creative consequences, e.g., production value. For example, they can affect the project's look by influencing the choice of [[filming location]]s.&lt;ref name="Discovery"/&gt; While the director is in charge of all purely artistic decisions, the line producer helps to substantiate the director's creative ideas by taking care of [[logistics]] and related issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Runs the more practical aspects of the production such as logistics and personnel, as opposed to the creative content|url=http://www.mediacollege.com/employment/television/producer.html|accessdate = March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; From [[pre-production]] through [[principal photography]], the line producer oversees the [[production budget]] and physical needs of the shoot.  By the first day of production, several versions of the budget have usually been drafted. A finalized or "locked" budget is the basis for the production to move forward. A key objective of a line producer is to respect this "locked" budget and deliver in time.

While in production, the line producer oversees the execution of many decisions that must be made to deliver each day's shoot.  The administrative aspects, especially those that have any financial impact, are all crucial areas of the line producer's work.  These areas include but are not limited to negotiating compensation (usually during pre-production) of crew members (both for union and non-union productions) and resolving daily production issues (in conjunction with the [[assistant director|first assistant director]] and possibly the [[unit production manager]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A line producer is the person who is in charge of hiring all of the below-the-line production crew such as camera crews, lighting crews and catering staffs.|url=http://filmtvcareers.about.com/od/basics/p/CP_Line_Prod.htm|accessdate = March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, they provide demanded equipment. If required, they handle unanticipated scheduling changes and serve "as a liaison between the crew and the producer."&lt;ref name="Discovery"/&gt;

==Becoming a line producer==
Line producers usually come from the ranks of assistant directors and unit production managers, giving them a strong background in the logistics of [[filmmaking]] and [[time management]]. It is common for them to continue to perform in one of those roles on projects they line produce. They do not necessarily attend a [[film school]].&lt;ref name="Film Connection Film Institute"/&gt;

== History ==

Indian English Poetry is one of the oldest forms of [[Indian English Literature]]. Indian [[poets]] writing in English have succeeded to indianize English in order to reveal nuances of [[Culture of India|Indian culture]] or cultures. [[Henry Louis Vivian Derozio]] , [[Sri Aurobindo]], [[Sarojini Naidu]], Michael Madhusudan Dutt and [[Toru Dutt]] among others laid the foundation of Indian English Poetry but since then there has been tremendous development in Indian English Poetry both in stylistic and thematic concerns. [[Nissim Ezekiel]] with the publication of his first book, ''[[A Time to Change]]'', in 1952 heralded in a new era of Modern Indian English Poetry. Since then notable poets like [[A. K. Ramanujan]], [[R. Parthasarathy]], [[Jayanta Mahapatra]], [[Dom Moraes]], [[Kamala Das]], [[Keki N. Daruwalla]], [[Arvind Krishna Mehrotra]], [[Arun Kolatkar]], [[Dilip Chitre]], [[Eunice De Souza]], [[Gieve Patel]], [[P.

Thomas]], Anand Thakore, [[Abhay K]], [[Anju Makhija]], [[Anjum Hasan]],  [[Hoshang Merchant]],Anupama Raju, [[Madan Gopal Gandhi]], [[Arundhathi Subramaniam]], [[Bibhu Padhi]], [[C. P. Surendran]], Desmond L.Kharmawplang, [[Dileep Jhaveri]], E.V. Ramakrishnan, [[Anuradha Bhattacharyya]], [[Gopi Kottoor]], [[Jayanta Mahapatra]], [[Jeet Thayil]], [[Jerry Pinto]], [[K Srilata]], [[K. V. Dominic]], [[D. C. Chambial]], [[T. Vasudeva Reddy]], Bibhu Padhi, Kumar Vikram, Kynpham Sing Nongkynrih, [[Makarand Paranjape]],  Akhil Katyal, Linda Ashok, [[Mani Rao]], [[Meena Kandasamy]], Menka Shivdasani, Fengkha Deep Daimari, Lalthanmawia, Manohar Shetty, Mustansir Dalvi, [[Nandini Sahu]], Priya Sarukkai Chabria, Rachana Joshi, [[Ranjit Hoskote]], Rita Malhotra, Nar Deo Sharma [[Robin Ngangom]], [[Nitoo Das]] , [[Rukmini Bhaya Nair]], Sridala Swami, Sumana Roy, [[Sudeep Sen]], [[Sukrita Paul Kumar]], [[Nalini Priyadarshni]], [[Gopi Kottoor]], [[Vijay Nambisan]], [[Vihang A.

== Anthology ==
In [[book publishing]], an [[anthology]] is a collection of literary works chosen by the compiler. It may be a collection of [[poems]], [[short stories]], [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[songs]], or [[excerpt]]s, usually collected into a single volume for [[publication]].

Although Indian English Poetry dates back to the [[19th century]] it was only in the 1950s that a comprehensive anthology of Indian English Poetry was published. Early efforts in the publication of Indian English Poetry anthologies were made in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s but they were extremely sparse and made very little impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Literary Criticism of Indian Poetry in English|last=Naik|first=M.K.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the 1950s there has been a steady amount of anthologies published every [[decade]].

'''''Memoirs of a Dervish: Sufis, Mystics and the Sixties''''' is an autobiography by  [[Robert Irwin (writer)|Robert Irwin]], a British historian, novelist, and writer on [[Arabic literature]].

==Synopsis==
In the summer of 1964, the author left behind the popular culture of the "Swinging Sixties" in England, a time when many were journeying to the East in search of [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|spiritual enlightenment]]. In the book, he contrasts that [[hippie]] [[subculture]] with the "bombs and guns and [[Sufism|[Sufi]]] [[mysticism]]"&lt;ref name="Profile Books"&gt;{{cite web

==Reception==
In the ''[[Financial Times]]'', [[Rory MacLean]] writes that the author "has given retrospective shape to his youth and formed a true story that will last forever, or at least until the pages of this wonderful, bittersweet memoir crumble into dust."&lt;ref name="FT" /&gt;

Steve Jelbert writes in ''[[The Independent]]'' that "the sheer strangeness of Irwin's quest [...] impresses.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt; He goes on to say that "Irwin's witty, casually erudite tribute to his clever, naïve youth shows that there are no short cuts to wisdom. But it often comes with age."&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;

Mick Brown, writing in ''[[Literary Review]]'' is of the opinion that "Irwin brilliantly conjures the mood of the late Sixties, with its blind innocence, fanciful enthusiasms and blissful music."&lt;ref name="LiteraryReview"&gt;{{cite journal

In the ''[[New Statesman]]'', John Gray writes that "Robert Irwin begins one of the most delightfully diverting explorations of the byways of memory to have appeared in many years - and one of the most profound"&lt;ref name="New Statesman" /&gt; and finds "the core of the book [to be] a sincere spiritual search, recounted with rare candour and arresting insight."&lt;ref name="New Statesman" /&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Spectator]]'', [[Anthony Sattin]] finds the book "a more enlightening type of memoir" than what he sees as the current fad of the "misery memoir".&lt;ref name="Spectator Sattin"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sattin describes the work as "haunting" and goes on to say that the book "conveys with power and eloquence the writer's gratitude for having nourished the spiritual side of life and his disapproval of the way that many Muslims today interpret the Qur'an."&lt;ref name="Spectator Sattin" /&gt;

An '''open-source curriculum''' ('''OSC''') is an online instructional resource that can be freely used, distributed and modified. OSC is based on the [[open-source]] practice of creating products or [[software]] that opens up access to source materials or codes.  Applied to education, this process invites feedback and participation from developers, educators, government officials, students and parents and empowers them to exchange ideas, improve best practices and create world-class curricula.  These "development" communities can form ad-hoc, within the same subject area or around a common student need, and allow for a variety of editing and workflow structures.

==Examples==

OSC repositories such as [[Wikiversity]],&lt;ref name="wikiversity"&gt;{{cite web|author= Norm Friesen, Janet Hopkins|title=Wikiversity; or education meets the free culture movement: An ethnographic investigation|publisher=First Monday: Peer reviewed journal on the internet|url=http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2234/2031|accessdate = 23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Curriki]] – Global Learning &amp; Education Community, [[MIT OpenCourseWare]] and [[OpenStax CNX|Connexions]] are one way in which the concept of open-source curriculum is being explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Paul Stacey|title=Foundation Funded OER vs. Tax Payer Funded OER – A Tale of Two Mandates|publisher=|url=http://edtechfrontier.com/tag/connexions/|accessdate = 23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Paul Biba|title=Free textbooks from Curriki|publisher=TeleRead|url=http://www.teleread.com/paul-biba/free-textbooks-from-curriki/|accessdate = 23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these online repositories, a curriculum framework for a particular course is created by an instructional designer or author in conjunction with content experts. Learning objectives are clearly identified, and learning activities and instructional sequences and assessments are developed and offered to support the attainment of the objectives. However, all users (from students to educators) are empowered to add, delete, and modify the learning activities, resources and generally contribute to the learning environment. In short, each user contributes to the repository and is able to select curricula based on individual interests.&lt;ref name="wikiversity"/&gt;

The [http://wiki.bssd.org Open Content Curriculum Project] was initiated with MediaWiki software in 2005, and offers a standards-based K-12 curriculum that is collaboratively edited, contains teacher- and student-created resources, assessment rubrics, lesson plans, and instructional resources. All 10,500 pages of content, and 4,240 file uploads are Creative Commons licensed, and the system is used daily by the [[Bering Strait School District]], an Alaska school district. The project welcomes use and active contributions by outside teachers, students and other interested parties. There are currently 2,500 registered users in the database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Sara Bernard|title=Teachers and Students Create Their Own Curriculum in Alaska|publisher= Mind Shift|url=http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/2010/11/teachers-and-students-create-their-own-curriculum-in-alaska/|accessdate = 23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[Free Knowledge Institute|Free Technology Academy]] is a joint initiative of the [[Free Knowledge Institute]] and several European universities to provide master-level education on Free Software, Open Standards and related subjects. All FTA course books are openly published under copyleft licenses.

The [[Saylor Foundation]] is a non-profit organization that produces new open-source educational content and curates existing open resources to support college-level courses. Its course outlines are licensed under a [[Creative Commons license|CC-BY]] license, making those outlines open-source curricula.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saylor.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Saylor has created nearly 241 college courses using open educational resources, making Saylor.org one of the largest currently-available collections of free courses on the web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=241 OER Courses with Assessments in Moodle: How Saylor.org has created one of the largest Free and Open Course Initiatives on the web|publisher= Moodle News|url=http://www.moodlenews.com/2012/250-oer-courses-and-assessments-in-moodle-how-saylor-org-has-created-one-of-the-largest-open-course-initiatives-on-the-web/|accessdate = 23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''page-turner''' is a person employed to turn [[sheet music]] pages for a soloist, often a [[pianist]], usually during a performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99499124 |title=Turning A Page? Better Consult A Professional |first=Susan |last=Stamberg |work=npr.org |year=2009 |accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some music is arranged so that the pages end at places where the musician can spare one hand to turn them, this is not always possible. A page-turner is often necessary for musicians who are playing complex pieces and prefer not to play from memory. A page-turner needs to be able to understand the musician's signals and follow the music to know when to turn the page, and to do so quickly and unobtrusively. Page-turners are sometimes acquaintances of the performer or members of the accompanying orchestra doing a favour. Professional page-turners are often freelance casual workers, not associated with any given concert hall or orchestra.

Mechanical page-turners are also available,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1999/pageturner.html |title=Automatic page turner could help musicians and the disabled|work=web.mit.edu |year=1999 |accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes controlled by the musician via a foot pedal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | country = US | number = 5962801 | status = patent  | title = Page turner  | pubdate = 5 October 1999  | gdate =  | fdate = 8 January 1998 | pridate =  | inventor = Tim Bowman, Ben Shepard | invent1 =  | invent2 =  | assign1 =  | assign2 =  | class = B42D9/04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Hallé]] is said to have invented the automatic page-turner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Siepmann | first = Jeremy | title = The Piano | publisher = Hal Leonard Corporation | location = Milwaukee | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-7935-9976-8 | page= 181 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foot pedals to turn pages are also available for music displayed on computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Dobrin |title=Classical music page-turners turn the page into the modern era |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/columnists/peter_dobrin/20160424_Classical_music_page-turners_turn_the_page_into_the_modern_era.html |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=22 April 2016 |accessdate=24 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1975">A ''' pillar tomb''' is a type of monumental [[grave]] wherein the central feature is a single, prominent pillar or column, often made of stone.

==Overview==
[[File:Pillar_tomb_(Malindi).JPG|thumb|Pillar tomb in Malindi, Kenya]]
A number of world cultures incorporated pillars into tomb structures. Examples of such edifices are found in the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] colony of [[Lycia]] in [[Anatolia]] (e.g., the [[Harpy Tomb]] at [[Xanthos]]), and the [[medieval]] Muslim [[Swahili culture]] of the [[Swahili Coast]] (e.g., tombs at [[Malindi]] and [[Mnarani]]), which were originally built of [[coral rag]], and later of stone.

In the historic town of [[Hannassa]] in southern [[Somalia]], ruins of houses with [[arch]]ways and [[courtyard]]s have been found along with pillar tombs, including a rare [[octagon]]al one.&lt;ref name="Arotssc"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanseverino|first1=Hilary Costa|title=Archaeological Remains on the Southern Somali Coast|journal=Azania: Archaeological Research in Africa|date=1983|volume=18|issue=1|pages=151–164|doi=10.1080/00672708309511319|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00672708309511319#.VGJ0To938jg|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Port Dunford]], situated nearby, also contains a number of ancient ruins, including several pillar tombs.

'''''Rienzi vowing to obtain justice for the death of his young brother, slain in a skirmish between the Colonna and the Orsini factions''''' (or simply, '''''Rienzi''''') is a painting by [[William Holman Hunt]], produced in 1849 and currently in a private collection.

==History==
This painting, with its extremely long title, was the first of Hunt's works to include 'PRB' ([[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]]) on the canvas.

Hunt took his subject from the 1835 novel ''Rienzi, the Last of the Roman Tribunes'', by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Bulwer Lytton]],&lt;ref&gt;Several of Bulwer-Lytton's novels were made into [[opera]]s, with ''[[Rienzi|Rienzi, der Letzte der Tribunen]]'' being composed by [[Richard Wagner]], and eventually becoming more famous than the novel.&lt;/ref&gt; about [[Cola di Rienzi]] (1313–1354), a papal [[notary]] who led a popular uprising in Rome.  It was exhibited at the 1849 [[Royal Academy]] exhibition (alongside [[John Everett Millais|Millais']] ''[[Isabella (Millais painting)|Lorenzo and Isabella]]'') with the following excerpt from the novel, describing the hero's reaction to the incident:
{{quotation|But for that event, the future liberator of Rome might have been but a dreamer, a scholar, a poet, - the peaceful rival of [[Petrarch]] - a man of thoughts, not deeds. But from that time, all his faculties, energies, fancies, genius, became concentrated to a single point and patriotism, before a vision, leaped into the life and vigour of a passion.''|Rienzi, the Last of the Roman Tribunes, Book I, chap. 1, 23&lt;ref&gt;As quoted by ''The London Literary Gazette'' of 5 December 1835, Vol.19 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=WV0ZAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false GoogleBook]); see also print ed., Edward George Bulwer-Lytton, ''Rienzi, the Last of the Roman Tribunes'', Adamant Media Corporation (2001). {{ISBN|0-543-87518-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

In 1847, Hunt repeatedly sat up all night to finish [[John Ruskin]]'s ''[[Modern Painters]]'' (1843);&lt;ref&gt;Composed of five volumes, the second one was influential on the early development of [[Pre-Raphaelitism]]&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Rienzi'' he attempted to put into practice all that he had read. The background particularly was painted in careful detail trying to satisfy Ruskin's stringent requirements. As can be seen from some of Hunt's later work, such as ''[[The Hireling Shepherd]]'' (1851) and ''[[The Awakening Conscience]]'' (1854), the artist often experienced great difficulty with painting his figures in natural poses. This is evident here in the portrayal of the soldier on the far left of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. J. Bronkhurst, ''William Holman Hunt : A Catalogue Raisonné'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rupert D'Oyly Carte.jpg|right|upright=1|thumb|Rupert D'Oyly Carte]]
'''Rupert D'Oyly Carte''' (3 November 1876 – 12 September 1948) was an English hotelier, theatre owner and [[impresario]], best known as proprietor of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] and [[Savoy Hotel]] from 1913 to 1948.

Son of the impresario and hotelier [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], Rupert inherited the family businesses from his stepmother [[Helen Carte|Helen]].  After serving in [[World War I]], he took steps to revitalise the opera company, which had not appeared in Central London since 1909, hiring new designers and conductors to present fresh productions of the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas in seasons in the [[West End theatre|West End]].  The new productions generally retained the original text and music of the operas.  Carte launched international and provincial tours, as well as the London seasons, and he released the first complete recordings of the operas.  He also rebuilt the half-century-old [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1929, opening the house with a season of Gilbert and Sullivan.

As an hotelier, Carte built on his father's legacy, expanding the [[Savoy Hotel]], refreshing the other hotels and restaurants in the Savoy group, including [[Claridges|Claridge's]] and the [[The Berkeley|Berkeley Hotel]], and introducing cabaret and dance bands that became internationally famous.  He also increased marketing activities, including foreign marketing, of the hotels.

[[P. G. Wodehouse]] based a character in his novels, [[Psmith]], on a [[Winchester College|Wykehamist]] schoolboy whom he identified as Rupert D'Oyly Carte.  At his death, Carte passed the opera company and hotels to his only surviving child, [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte]].  The Gilbert and Sullivan operas, nurtured by Carte and his family for over a century, continue to be produced frequently today throughout the English-speaking world and beyond.

==Life and career==
[[File:RichardD'OylyCarte.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Rupert's father, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]]]]

===Early life===
Rupert D'Oyly Carte was born in [[Hampstead]], London, the younger son of the impresario [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] and his first wife Blanche (née Prowse), who died in 1885.  Like his brother, Lucas (1872–1907), he was given his father's middle name.  He was educated at [[Winchester College]], noted as among the most intellectually rigorous of English public schools.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''Financial Times'', 16 August 2008, p. 1; and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', 31 May 2009, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  He then worked for a firm of accountants before joining his father as an assistant in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/html/carte.html "The D'Oyly Carte Family"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050220163843/http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/html/carte.html |date=20 February 2005 }} page, at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'' states that Rupert attended [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], but if he did so, he did not graduate, if the above dates, taken from ''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]]'', are correct.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a newspaper interview given in the year of his death, Rupert recalled that as a young man he was entrusted, during his father's illness, with helping [[W. S. Gilbert]] with the first revival of ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' at the [[Savoy Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Post]]'', 7 January 1948.  The newspaper report states that this was when he was 22, but the first revival of ''Yeomen'' was in May 1897, when Rupert D'Oyly Carte was only 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was elected a director of the [[Savoy Hotel]] Limited in 1898, joining his father and [[Arthur Sullivan|Sir Arthur Sullivan]], who had served on the board since the Savoy Hotel was built.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 11 May 1949, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1899 he was assistant managing director.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 7 June 1899, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Richard D'Oyly Carte died in 1901, and Rupert's stepmother, the former [[Helen Lenoir]], who had married Richard in 1888, assumed full control of most of the family businesses, which she had increasingly controlled during her husband's decline.  Rupert's elder brother, Lucas, a barrister, was not involved in the family businesses and died of tuberculosis, aged 34.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas was educated at [[Winchester College]] and then [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], and was called to the bar in 1897.  He was appointed Private Secretary to [[Lord Chief Justice]] [[Charles Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen|Charles Russell]] in 1899 and died of tuberculosis on 18 January 1907.  See Obituary of Lucas D'Oyly Carte, ''The Times'', 22 January 1907, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taking over the family businesses===
In 1903, at the age of 27, Rupert took over his late father's role as chairman of the Savoy group, which included the Savoy Hotel, [[Claridges|Claridge's]], [[The Berkeley|The Berkeley Hotel]], [[Simpson's-in-the-Strand]] and the Grand Hotel in Rome.  At this time, the whole group was officially valued at £2,221,708.&lt;ref name=tt&gt;''The Times'', 21 February 1903, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  He immediately issued £300,000 of [[debenture]]s to raise capital for a large extension to the Savoy (the "East Block").&lt;ref name=tt/&gt;  Like his father, Carte was willing to go to great lengths to secure the best employees for his hotels.  When Claridge's needed a new chef in 1904, he secured the services of François Bonnaure, formerly chef at the [[Élysée Palace]] in Paris.  The press speculated on how much Carte must have paid to persuade Bonnaure to join him, and compared the younger Carte's audacity with his father's coup in securing Paris's most famous ''maître d'hôtel'', M. Joseph, a few years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Daily Mirror]]'', 10 June 1904, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rupert carte 1919.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Carte in 1919]]
Between 1906 and 1909, Helen Carte,&lt;ref&gt;Helen had remarried [[Stanley Boulter]], but was generally still known as "Carte" in business.&lt;/ref&gt; Rupert's stepmother, staged two repertory seasons at the [[Savoy Theatre]].  Directed by Gilbert and received with much success, they revitalised the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]], which had been in decline after Richard D'Oyly Carte's death.&lt;ref&gt;Carte, Bridget D'Oyly. Foreword to Mander, Raymond and Joe Mitchenson, ''A Picture History of Gilbert and Sullivan'', Vista Books, London, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1912, when theatre censorship was under discussion in Britain, Carte was strongly in favour of retaining censorship, because it gave managements complete certainty about what they could or could not stage without fear of interference by the police or others.  He joined with other London theatre managers, including [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], [[George Edwardes]] and [[Arthur Bourchier]] in signing a petition for the retention of censorship.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 1 April 1912, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year, together with [[Herbert Sullivan]] and theatre managers including Beerbohm Tree and [[Squire Bancroft]], Carte was an instigator of a memorial to [[W. S. Gilbert]] at Charing Cross.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 3 June 1912, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1913, Rupert's stepmother Helen Carte died.  She left all her holdings in the Savoy Hotel group, the Savoy Theatre and the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company to her stepson.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 26 May 1913, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revitalising the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company===
After London seasons in 1906–07 and 1908–09, the opera company did not perform in the [[West End theatre|West End]] again until 1919, although it continued to tour in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;The company toured for ten months per year.  Its outer London engagements in these years were in [[Camden Town]], [[Clapham]], [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]], [[Deptford]], [[Fulham]], [[Hammersmith]], [[Holloway, London|Holloway]], [[Kennington]], New Cross, [[Notting Hill]], [[Peckham]], Richmond, Stratford, Wimbledon and [[Woolwich]].  See Rollins and Witts.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the theatre writer H. M. Walbrook, "Through the years of the [[Great War]] they continued to be on tour through the country, drawing large and grateful audiences everywhere.  They helped to sustain the spirits of the people during that stern period, and by so doing they helped to win the victory."&lt;ref&gt;Walbrook, H. M. [http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/books/walbrook/chap16.html Chapter 16,] ''Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Opera, A History and a Comment'', (1920) London: F. V. White &amp; Co. Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, Carte later recalled, "I went and watched the Company playing at a rather dreary theatre down in the suburbs of London.  I thought the dresses looked dowdy....  I formed the view that new productions should be prepared, with scenery and dresses to the design of first class artists who understood the operas but who would produce a décor attractive to the new generation."&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 430; Reprinted in [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/carte/1919/index.html "Rupert D'Oyly Carte's Season ... 1919-20"], at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 20 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 1922 memoir, [[Henry Lytton]], having admired Richard D'Oyly Carte's keen eye for stagecraft, added, "That 'eye' for stagecraft ... has been inherited in a quite remarkable degree by his son, Mr. Rupert D'Oyly Carte.  He, too, has the gift of taking in the details of a scene at a glance, and knowing instinctively just what must be corrected".&lt;ref&gt;Lytton, Henry. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/lytton_secrets/ch4.html Chapter 4,] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706175513/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/lytton_secrets/ch4.html |date=6 July 2008 }} ''Secrets of a Savoyard'' (1922), online at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 12 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1911, the company hired [[J. M. Gordon]] as stage manager, and Carte later promoted him to director.  Gordon, under Carte's supervision, preserved the company's traditions in exacting detail for 28 years.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, David. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/G/GordonJM.htm J. M. Gordon] at Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 27 August 2001, accessed 12 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1919-20season.jpg|thumb|300px|Souvenir programme cover – 1919-20 season]]
During [[World War I]] Carte served in the [[Royal Navy]],&lt;ref name=centenary&gt;Bettany, Clemence.  ''The D'Oyly Carte Centenary Book'', a souvenir book published by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company during its 1975 centenary season at the Savoy Theatre.&lt;/ref&gt; and no renovation work could be undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;During the war, Carte served as a [[King's Messenger]].  See Duffey, David. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/html/carte.html "The D'Oyly Carte Family",] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050220163843/http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/html/carte.html |date=20 February 2005 }} ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', 20 September 2003, accessed 12 November 2009.  Baily states that, during the war, "Carte was on special duties in the Navy: he would be sent off on secret journeys to distant parts of the world, and he would mysteriously reappear in London for a few weeks, and when he did so he would put in a few touches to the preparatory work for the rebirth of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company."  Baily, p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt;  On his return, he put his aims into effect.  In an interview in ''[[The Observer]]'' in August 1919 he set out his policy for staging the operas: "They will be played precisely in their original form, without any alteration to the words, or any attempt to bring them up to date."&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 24 August 1919, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; This uncompromising declaration was modified in a later interview in which he said, "the plays are all being restaged ... Gilbert's words will be unaltered, though there will be some freshness in the method of rendering them.  Artists must have scope for their individuality, and new singers cannot be tied down to imitate slavishly those who made successes in the old days."&lt;ref name=centenary/&gt;

Carte's first London season, at the [[Shaftesbury Theatre|Prince's Theatre]], 1919–20, featured ten of the thirteen extant Gilbert and Sullivan operas.&lt;ref&gt;Carte's first London season did not include ''[[Ruddigore]]'', ''[[Utopia, Limited]]'' and ''[[The Grand Duke]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  These included ''[[Princess Ida]]'', which had its first London performances since the original production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/carte/1919/index.html Information about the 1919-20 season] at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 20 January 2009.  In a last-night speech at the end of the 1924 London season, Carte said that he hoped to revive ''Utopia, Limited'' in 1925.  See ''The Times'' 28 July 1924, p. 10.  The opera was not, however, revived until 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;  The new productions retained the text and music of the original 1870s and 1880s productions, and director J. M. Gordon preserved much of Gilbert's original direction.  As his parents had done, Carte licensed the operas to the [[J. C. Williamson]] company and to amateur companies, but he required all licensees to present them in approved productions that closely followed the libretto, score and D'Oyly Carte production stagings.&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;Bradley, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview with ''[[The Times]]'' in 1922, Carte said that the Savoy "tradition" was an expression that was frequently misunderstood: "It did not by any means imply any hidebound stage 'business' or an attempt to standardize the performances of artists so as to check their individual method of expression.  All that it implied, in his view, was the highest possible standard of production – with especial attention to clear enunciation....  Many people seemed to think that Gilbert believed in absolutely set methods but this was not by any means the case.  He did not hesitate to alter productions when they were revived."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times,'' 10 April 1922, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he had told the press that the original words and music would not be altered, Carte was willing to make changes in certain cases.  In 1919–20, he authorised significant cuts and alterations in both ''Princess Ida'' and ''Ruddigore''. In 1921 ''[[Cox and Box]]'' was produced in a drastically cut-down version, to allow it to be played as a companion piece with the shorter [[Savoy operas]]. He also authorised changes to Gilbert's text: he wrote to ''The Times'' in 1948, "We found recently in America that much objection was taken by coloured persons to a word used twice in ''The Mikado''."  The word in question was Gilbert's reference to "nigger" (blackface) minstrels, and Carte asked [[A. P. Herbert]] to suggest an acceptable revision.  "He made several alternative suggestions, one of which we adopted in America, and it seems well to go on doing so in the British Empire."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' 28 May 1945, p. 8. A similar reference in ''Princess Ida'' was also altered.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:D'oyly-carte-the-joy-of-three-generations-1921.jpg|thumb|left|1921 cartoon: D'Oyly Carte audiences]]
Carte commissioned new costumes and scenery throughout his tenure with the company.  For his restagings, Carte hired [[Charles Ricketts]] to redesign ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' and ''[[The Mikado]]'', the costumes for the latter, created in 1926, being retained by all the company's subsequent designers. Other redesigns were by [[Percy Anderson]], [[George Sheringham]], [[Hugo Rumbold]] and [[Peter Goffin]], a protégé of Carte's daughter, [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte]].

For London seasons, Carte often engaged guest conductors, first [[Geoffrey Toye]], then [[Malcolm Sargent]], who examined Sullivan's manuscript scores and purged the orchestral parts of accretions.  So striking was the orchestral sound produced by Sargent that the press thought he had retouched the scores, and Carte had the pleasant duty of correcting their error.  In a letter to ''The Times'', he noted that "the details of the orchestration sounded so fresh that some of the critics thought them actually new ... the opera was played last night exactly as written by Sullivan."&lt;ref&gt;Carte, Rupert D'Oyly, ''The Times'', 22 September 1926, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte also hired [[Harry Norris (conductor)|Harry Norris]], who started with the touring company, then was Toye's assistant before becoming musical director.  [[Isidore Godfrey]] joined the company as assistant musical director in 1925 and became musical director in 1929, remaining in that post until 1968.

The possibilities of the [[Gramaphone record|gramophone]] appealed to Carte.  After World War I, he supervised a series of complete recordings of the scores of the operas on the [[HMV]] label, beginning with ''The Mikado'' in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Recordings of Gilbert and Sullivan songs had been made as early as the 1890s (Joseph, p. 220), and there were several complete or nearly-complete operas recorded in the early years of the twentieth century, not under D'Oyly Carte auspices.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first nine sets, made between 1918 and 1925, were recorded by the early [[Gramophone record#Acoustic recording|acoustic process]]. At first, guest singers were chosen who were known for their ability to record well on this technology.  Later in this series, more of the regular members of the company were featured.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Marc. [http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/narracou-doc.htm "The First D'Oyly Carte Recordings",] ''A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography'', 18 November 2001, accessed 21 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  With the introduction of [[Gramophone record#"Electrical" recording|electrical recording]] and its greatly improved recording process and sound, a new round of recordings began in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Marc. [http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/narrelec-cmpl.htm "The D'Oyly Carte Complete Electrical Sets",] ''A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography'', 18 November 2001, accessed 21 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the electrical series, Carte's own singers were mostly used.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. XI–XII.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte also recognised the potential of radio and worked with the [[BBC]] to relay live broadcasts of D'Oyly Carte productions.  A 1926 relay of part of a Savoy Theatre performance of ''The Mikado'' was heard by up to eight million people.  The ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' noted that this was "probably the largest audience that has ever heard anything at one time in the history of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;  Under Carte, the company continued to make broadcasts during the interwar years.  In 1932, ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' became the first Gilbert and Sullivan opera to be broadcast in its entirety.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Chris.

===Rebuilding the Savoy Theatre and later years===
In 1929 Carte had the 48-year-old Savoy Theatre rebuilt and modernised.  It closed on 3 June 1929 and was gutted and completely rebuilt to designs by Frank A. Tugwell with décor by [[Basil Ionides]].  The old house had three tiers; the new one had two.  The seating capacity (which had decreased to 986 from its original 1,292) was restored nearly completely, to 1,200.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 21 October 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;  The theatre reopened 135 days later on 21 October 1929,&lt;ref&gt;Savoy Theatre programme note, September 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; with ''[[The Gondoliers]],'' designed by Ricketts and conducted by Sargent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/carte/1929/index.html Information about the 1929-20 season and the new designs,] ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 12 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Ernest Newman]] wrote, "I can imagine no gayer or more exhilarating frame for the Gilbert and Sullivan operas than the Savoy as it is now."&lt;ref&gt;''quoted'' in Baily, p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its historical connection with Gilbert and Sullivan, most of Carte's London seasons were staged not at the Savoy but at two larger houses: the Prince's (now the [[Shaftesbury Theatre|Shaftesbury]]) Theatre (1919–20, 1921–22, 1924, 1926, 1942 and [[Sadler's Wells]] (1935, 1936, 1937, 1939, 1947 and 1948).&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 136–72&lt;/ref&gt;   His three Savoy Theatre seasons were in 1929–30, 1932–33, and 1941.  In addition to year-round UK tours, Carte mounted tours of North America in 1927, 1928–29, 1934–35, 1936–37, 1939 and 1947–48).&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 153–72&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1936 tour an American critic wrote, "If there were only some way of keeping them on this side permanently. I humbly suggest to the [[New Deal]] that it cancel England's war debt in exchange for the D'Oyly Cartians. We should be much the gainer."&lt;ref&gt;''The Philadelphia Public Ledger'', ''quoted'' in Baily, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte was deeply affected by the death of his son Michael in 1932, discussed below.  The actor [[Martyn Green]] said, "The heart dropped right out of him.  His interest in both the operas and the hotel seemed to fade away."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 219, ''quoting'' [[Martyn Green]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, in 1934 the company made a highly successful eight-month North American tour with Green as its new principal comedian, replacing [[Henry Lytton]].&lt;ref name=Wilson128&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte gave approval for, and was closely consulted about, a 1938 film version of ''The Mikado'' produced and conducted by Geoffrey Toye, starring Green and released by Universal Pictures,&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Marc. [http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/mikfilm.htm "The Technicolor ''Mikado'' Film (1939)",] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616150713/http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/mikfilm.htm |date=16 June 2006 }} ''A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography'' (2001), accessed 20 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; but his only new stage production after 1932 was of ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' designed in 1939 by [[Peter Goffin]]. The re-staging was regarded as radical, but when Goffin took fright at the storm of controversy, Carte told him, "I don't care what they say about the production. I should care if they said nothing."&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 September 1939, at the outbreak of [[World War II]], the British government ordered the immediate and indefinite closure of all theatres.  Carte cancelled the autumn tour and disbanded the company.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;  Theatres were permitted to reopen from 9 September,&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 9 September 1939, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; but it took some weeks to re-form the company.  The company resumed touring in [[Edinburgh]] on Christmas Day 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;  It continued to perform throughout the war, but German bombing destroyed the sets and costumes for five of its productions: ''Cox and Box'', ''[[The Sorcerer]]'', ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', ''[[Princess Ida]]'' and ''Ruddigore''.  The old productions of ''Pinafore'' and ''Cox and Box'' were recreated shortly after the war, but the other two operas took longer to rejoin the company's repertory.&lt;ref&gt;''Pinafore'' re-entered the repertory in July 1947, ''Cox and Box'' in the 1947–48 season, ''Ruddigore'' in November 1948, and ''Princess Ida'' in September 1954 (see Rollins and Witts, pp. 171-79 and VII-VIII).  ''The Sorcerer'' was not revived until April 1971 (see ''The Times'', 2 April 1971, p. 10).&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, for the first wartime season, Peter Goffin designed and directed a new production of ''The Yeomen of the Guard'' first seen in January 1940, and his new ''Ruddigore'' debuted in 1948, shortly after Carte's death.  A return of the Company to the U.S. in 1947 was very successful.&lt;ref name=Wilson128/&gt;

===Savoy Hotel group===
From the beginning of his career, Carte maintained the Savoy group in London, disposing in 1919 of the Grand Hotel, Rome, which his father had acquired in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 15 July 1896, p. 4; and 20 December 1919, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, he ensured that the Savoy continued to attract a fashionable clientele by a continuous programme of modernisation and the introduction of dancing in the large restaurants.  The [[Savoy Orpheans]] and the [[Savoy Havana Band]] were described by ''The Times'' as "probably the best-known bands in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 29 March 1924, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1927 Carte appointed his opera company's general manager, Richard Collet, to run the cabaret at the Savoy, which began in April 1929.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 27 March 1929, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1930s, the Savoy group had not thought it necessary to advertise, but Carte and his manager [[George Reeves-Smith]] changed their approach.  Reeves-Smith told ''The Times'', "We are endeavouring by intensive propaganda work to get more customers; this work is going on in the U.S.A., in Canada, in the Argentine and in Europe."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 27 March 1931, p. 22; and 22 April 1932, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Towards the end of [[World War II]], Carte added to the Savoy group the bombed-out site near [[Leicester Square]] of Stone's Chop House, the freehold of which he purchased with a view to reopening the restaurant there on the lines of the group's Simpson's-in-the-Strand.  The revived Stone's reopened after Carte's death.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 5 April 1946, p. 9; and 14 October 1963, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
In 1907, Carte married Lady Dorothy Milner Gathorne-Hardy (1889–1977), the third and youngest daughter of the [[John Stewart Gathorne-Hardy, 2nd Earl of Cranbrook|2nd Earl of Cranbrook]], with whom he had a daughter, Bridget, and a son, Michael (1911–1932).  Michael was killed at the age of 21 in a motor accident in Switzerland.  In 1925, Carte and his wife had a country house built for them in [[Kingswear]], [[Devon]] named [[Coleton Fishacre]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/coleton-fishacre "Coleton Fishacre"], [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], accessed 5 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The house is still known for its design features and garden with exotic tropical plants.&lt;ref&gt;See the ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' magazine, 25 October 2007 feature on the house and gardens.&lt;/ref&gt; After her parents' divorce, Bridget D'Oyly Carte took over the house, which her father, who lived in London, would visit for long weekends.  She sold the house after his death, and it is now owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-coletonfishacrehouseandgarden Coleton Fishacre House and Garden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217084145/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-coletonfishacrehouseandgarden |date=17 December 2009 }}, Nationaltrust.org, accessed 5 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:01 Coleton Fishacre.JPG|thumb|left|Carte's House at [[Coleton Fishacre]]]]
Carte's private pastimes included gardening, notably at Coleton Fishacre, driving and yachting.  He was an early devotee of the motor car and incurred the displeasure of the courts more than once.  He was fined £3 for driving at 19 miles an hour in 1902,&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 3 November 1902, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and the following year he was subject to criminal prosecution for knocking down and injuring a child when driving at the speed of 24 miles an hour.  He made "every provision for the comfort of the child", who recovered from the accident.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 24 November 1903, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the years after World War I, he was a frequent competitor in yachting races.  From 1919 he raced his yacht "Kali" in the Hamble River class.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''The Times'', 22 July 1919, p. 5; and 11 August 1919, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he owned and raced a 19-ton cutter, "Content".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 19 August 1927, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Carte divorced his wife for adultery.  The suit was undefended.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 18 December 1941, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lady Dorothy moved to the [[Bahamas]] and married St Yves de Verteuil, who had been the co-respondent in the divorce case.  De Verteuil died in 1963, and Lady Dorothy de Verteuil died in February 1977.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 16 March 1977, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Psmith-1909.jpg|thumb|upright=.6|P. G. Wodehouse's [[Psmith]], said to be modelled on Carte]]
[[P. G. Wodehouse]] based the character [[Psmith]], seen in several of his comic novels, on either Rupert D'Oyly Carte or his brother Lucas.  In the introduction to his novel ''Something Fresh'', Wodehouse says that Psmith (originally named Rupert, then Ronald) was "based more or less faithfully on Rupert D'Oyly Carte, son of the Savoy theatre man.  He was at school with a cousin of mine, and my cousin happened to tell me about his monocle, his immaculate clothes and his habit, when asked by a master how he was, of replying, 'Sir, I grow thinnah and thinnah'."&lt;ref&gt;The Psmith novels include ''[[Mike (novel)|Mike]]'' (1909), ''[[Psmith in the City]]'' (1910), ''[[Psmith, Journalist]]'' (1915) and ''[[Leave it to Psmith]]'' (1923)&lt;/ref&gt;  Bridget D'Oyly Carte, however, believed that the [[Winchester College|Wykehamist]] schoolboy described to Wodehouse was not her father but his elder brother Lucas, who was also at Winchester College.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Rupert D'Oyly Carte was "shy, reserved and at times distinctly taciturn."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Psmith, by contrast, is outgoing and garrulous.&lt;ref&gt;"Don't ''talk'' so much! I never met a fellow like you for talking!" – Wodehouse, ''Leave it to Psmith'', ''quoted'' in Usborne, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and legacy===
Carte died at the Savoy Hotel, after a brief illness, at the age of 71.  A memorial service was held for him at the [[Savoy Chapel]] on 23 September 1948.&lt;ref&gt;"Our London Correspondence", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 23 September 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; His ashes were scattered on the headland at [[Coleton Fishacre]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Maev.  "An ideal cove", ''The Guardian'', 15 May 1999, p. G7.&lt;/ref&gt;  He left an estate valued at £228,436.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 6 October 1948, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  At his death, the family businesses passed to his daughter, Bridget D'Oyly Carte.  The Savoy hotel group remained under the control of the Carte family and its associates until 1994.&lt;ref name=billions&gt;Prynn, Jonathan. [http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23676788-details/Savoy+%27up+for+sale%27+as+Saudi+owner%27s+billions+dwindle/article.do "Savoy 'up for sale' as Saudi owner's billions dwindle"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419060158/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23676788-details/Savoy+'up+for+sale'+as+Saudi+owner's+billions+dwindle/article.do |date=19 April 2009 }}, 16 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte's hotels have remained among the most prestigious in London, with the ''[[Evening Standard|London Evening Standard]]'' calling the Savoy "London's most famous hotel" in 2009.&lt;ref name=billions/&gt;  The year after Carte's death, the opera company, which had been the personal possession of Richard and Rupert D'Oyly Carte, became a private company, of which Bridget retained a controlling interest and was chairman and managing director.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 24 March 1949, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  She inherited a company in strong condition,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 273–74.&lt;/ref&gt; but the rising costs of mounting professional light opera without any government support eventually became unsustainable, and the company closed in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gilbert and Sullivan operas, nurtured by Carte and his family for over a century, continue to be produced frequently today throughout the English-speaking world and beyond.&lt;ref name=Bradley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/html/websites/index.html List of 200 amateur G&amp;S performing groups] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117020238/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/html/websites/index.html |date=17 November 2010 }} at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 1 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Bernard.

'''Sara Maria Danius''' (born 5 April 1962 in [[Täby]]&lt;ref name="vemardet"&gt;[http://runeberg.org/vemardet/1993/0235.html Sara Danius], ''Vem är det: Svensk biografisk handbok 1993'', p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] scholar of [[literature]] and [[aesthetics]]. Danius is Professor of Aesthetics at [[Södertörn University]]&lt;ref name="akademien"&gt;[http://www.svenskaakademien.se/information/pressinformation/2013/ny-ledamot-i-svenska-akademien  Ny ledamot i Svenska Akademien] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311061421/http://www.svenskaakademien.se/information/pressinformation/2013/ny-ledamot-i-svenska-akademien |date=2013-03-11 }}, press release from the Swedish Academy, 7 March 2013 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Docent]] of Literature at [[Uppsala University]].&lt;ref name="dn"&gt;[http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/dn-medarbetare-tar-plats-i-svenska-akademien/ DN-medarbetare tar plats i Svenska akademien], ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' 7 March 2013 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Danius is the daughter of the author Anna Wahlgren (b. 1942) and Lars Danius (1907-1996).&lt;ref name="vemardet" /&gt; She is the oldest of eight siblings and half-siblings.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/17/the-ugly-scandal-that-cancelled-the-nobel-prize-in-literature&lt;/ref&gt;

Danius graduated from [[University of Stockholm]] in 1986. She received her [[Master of Arts]] in Critical Theory at the [[University of Nottingham]] in 1989. In 1997 she became a Ph.D. at [[Duke University]], and in 1999 she received a Ph.D. degree at Uppsala University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webappl.web.sh.se/p3/ext/content.nsf/aget?openagent&amp;key=sh_personal_profil_sv_657229 Sara Danius], profile at [[Södertörn University]] {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has published on the relationship between literature and society, and written about [[Marcel Proust]], [[Gustave Flaubert]] and [[James Joyce]].

Danius has worked as a literary critic for the Swedish daily newspaper ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' since 1986.&lt;ref name="vemardet" /&gt; She is an executive member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities|Royal Swedish Academy of Letters]] since 2010.

In March 2013, Danius was elected to be a member of the [[Swedish Academy]], succeeding [[Knut Ahnlund]] on chair 7. Danius was formally installed in the Academy at a ceremony on 20 December 2013.&lt;ref name="akademien" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dn" /&gt; She took over the post as permanent secretary of the Academy from [[Peter Englund]] on 1 June 2015.&lt;ref name="dn2"&gt;[http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/sara-danius-ersatter-peter-englund/ Sara Danius ersätter Peter Englund], ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' 20 December 2014 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svenskaakademien.se/en/the-academy/chair-no-7-sara-danius |title=Chair no. 7 - Sara Danius |publisher=The Swedish Academy |accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was asked to resign from her position and left the Academy on 12 April 2018 against the background of critique over the Academy's handling of the [[Jean-Claude Arnault]] scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aftenposten.no/verden/i/wEbb05/Sara-Danius-forlater-Svenska-Akademien|title=Sara Danius forlater Svenska Akademien|work=Aftenposten|access-date=2018-04-12|language=nb-NO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/permanent-secretary-of-the-swedish-academy-leaves-her-position/ |title=Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy leaves her position|last=Jones|first=Evelyn|date=12 April 2018|newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|language=en|access-date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two former permanent secretaries, [[Sture Allén]] and [[Horace Engdahl]], called Danius a weak leader in her handling of the affair.&lt;ref name=canderson&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/world/europe/sara-danius-swedish-nobel-scandal.html |title=In Nobel Scandal, a Man Is Accused of Sexual Misconduct.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3659">The '''Schreiber theory''' is a writer-centered approach to [[film criticism]] and [[film theory]] which holds that the principal author of a film is generally the [[screenwriter]] rather than the [[Film director|director]]. The term was coined by [[David Morris Kipen]], Director of Literature at the US [[National Endowment for the Arts]].

==Outline==
In his 2006 book “The Schreiber Theory: A Radical Rewrite of American Film History”, David Kipen argues that the influential 1950s-era [[auteur theory]] has wrongly skewed analysis towards a director-centred view of film. In contrast, Kipen believes that the screenwriter has a greater influence on the quality of a finished work and that knowing who wrote a film is “the surest predictor” of how good it will be:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“A filmgoer seeking out pictures written by, say, [[Eric Roth]] or [[Charlie Kaufman]] won’t always see a masterpiece, but he’ll see fewer clunkers than he would following even a brilliant director like [[John Boorman]], or an intelligent actor like [[Jeff Goldblum]]. It’s all a matter of betting on the fastest horse, instead of the most highly touted or the prettiest.”&lt;ref&gt;Kipen,  David (2006). ''The Schreiber Theory: A Radical Rewrite of American Film History'', p.38. Melville House {{ISBN|0-9766583-3-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kipen acknowledges that his writer-centred approach is not new, and pays tribute to earlier critics of auteur theory such as [[Pauline Kael]] and [[Richard Corliss]]. He believes that the auteurist approach remains dominant, however, and that films have suffered as a result of the screenwriter's role being undervalued. Kipen refers to his book as a “[[manifesto]]” and in an interview with the magazine [[San Francisco Film Society |SF360]] stated that he wished to use Schreiber theory as “a lever to change the way people think about screenwriting, and movies in general.”

==Origin of term==
In seeking a name for his theory, Kipen chose the German/[[Yiddish]] word for writer – Schreiber – in honour of the many early American screenwriters who had Yiddish as their mother tongue. &lt;ref&gt;Kipen,  David (2006). ''The Schreiber Theory: A Radical Rewrite of American Film History'', p.37. Melville House {{ISBN|0-9766583-3-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Writing in ''[[Variety (magazine) |Variety]]'', Diane Garrett said Kipen shows a degree of disingenuousness when he states that Schreiberism is “an attempt to rescue reviewing and scholarship from those who would have us forget just how collaborative filmmaking truly is.” She said: &lt;blockquote&gt;“If that’s really the goal, why spend 150 pages arguing for the supremacy of the writer? Instead say what you really mean: Don't forget the writer, please.”&lt;ref&gt;Diane Garrett. "[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117930243.html?categoryid=1010&amp;cs=1 Book Review: The Schreiber Theory]." ''Variety'', April 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In an interview with Kipen, film writer Michael Fox said Schreiberism seemed less an attempt to discredit Auteur theory outright than a ploy to “simply shift the auteur appellation from directors to screenwriters.” &lt;ref&gt;Michael Fox. [http://www.sf360.org/features/author-author-david-kipen-posits-a-new-auteur-theory Author! Author! David Kipen Posits a New Auteur Theory]. SF360, March 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kipen’s reply was that there was an element of “parody” in his writer-centred theory, in that he hoped to “overcorrect” the director-centred model in such a way that “the final average of the two is a more realistic representation”.

'''Spectral sensitivity''' is the relative efficiency of detection, of [[light]] or other signal, as a function of the [[frequency]] or [[wavelength]] of the signal.

In [[color vision|visual]] [[neuroscience]], spectral sensitivity is used to describe the different characteristics of the [[photopigment]]s in the [[rod cell]]s and [[cone cell]]s in the [[retina]] of the [[human eye|eye]]. It is known that the rod cells are more suited to [[scotopic vision]] and cone cells to [[photopic vision]], and that they differ in their sensitivity to different wavelengths of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Fundamentals of Sensation and Perception | author = Michael Levine | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | date = 2000 | edition = 3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Visual Perception: A Clinical Orientation | author = Steven H.

In [[photography]], film and sensors are often described in terms of their spectral sensitivity, to supplement their [[sensitometry|characteristic curves]] that describe their [[responsivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Advanced Photography | author =  Michael Langford | publisher = [[Focal Press]] | date = 1998 | ISBN = 0-240-51486-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Z92UjOE93SIC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=%22spectral+sensitivity%22+intitle:photography&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=2Ex5bPhpeRKM-lqFd1uACWiD06Q }}&lt;/ref&gt; A database of camera spectral sensitivity is created and its space analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = What is the space of spectral sensitivity functions for digital color cameras? | author =  Jun Jiang | author2 =  Dengyu Liu | author3 =  Jinwei Gu | author4 =  Sabine Süsstrunk | last-author-amp =  yes | publisher = IEEE | date = 2013 | ISBN = 978-1-4673-5053-2 | url = http://www.cis.rit.edu/~jxj1770/camSpec/}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[X-ray]] films, the spectral sensitivity is chosen to be appropriate to the phosphors that respond to X-rays, rather than being related to human vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Chesneys' Radiographic Imaging | author = John Ball | author2 = Tony Price | last-author-amp = yes | publisher = Blackwell Publishing | date = 1995 | ISBN = 0-632-03901-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jpwNLOhYRzgC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=%22spectral+sensitivity%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=A8utSH861ySF1v45Cj83PgSYvk4#PPA67,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sensor]] systems, where the output is easily quantified, the [[responsivity]] can be extended to be wavelength dependent, incorporating the spectral sensitivity.  When the sensor system is linear, its spectral sensitivity and spectral responsivity can both be decomposed with similar basis functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Physics-Based Vision | author =  Glenn E. Healey | author2 =  Steven A. Shafer | author3 =  Lawrence B. Wolff | last-author-amp =  yes | publisher = A. K. Peters Ltd. | date = 1992 | ISBN = 0-86720-295-5 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jdwLY6_r0ngC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=sensor-responsivity+%22spectral+sensitivity%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=Okaqe5495ftyrmagaVXLNemMx1I }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When a system's responsivity is a fixed monotonic nonlinear function, that nonlinearity can be estimated and corrected for, to determine the spectral sensitivity from spectral input–output data via standard linear methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Science of Color | author = Steven K. Shevell | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | date = 2003 | ISBN = 0-444-51251-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=G1TC1uXb7awC&amp;pg=PA337&amp;dq=sensor-responsivity+%22spectral+sensitivity%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=_uXZfqgS7K-bmP2Wik_QZg-oOLA#PPA290,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The responses of the rod and cone cells of the [[retina]], however, have a very context-dependent (coupled) nonlinear response, which complicates the analysis of their spectral sensitivities from experimental data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Adaptive mechanisms in the ecology of vision | author = S. N. Archer | publisher = Springer | date = 1999 | ISBN = 0-7923-5319-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4zUpQatwhwUC&amp;pg=PA340&amp;dq=retina++%22spectral+sensitivity%22+cone+rod+interaction&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=X8mbfvFql3MrkI-c3_VW46wfo8Q }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In spite of these complexities, however, the conversion of light energy spectra to the effective stimulus, the excitation of the [[photopigment]], is quite linear, and linear characterizations such as spectral sensitivity are therefore quite useful in describing many properties of [[color vision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Light Vision Color | author = Arne Valberg | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | date = 1995 | ISBN = 0-470-84902-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OoESifAi9ZsC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=cones+%22spectral+sensitivity%22++linear+nonlinear&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=Uzck4k9jxCxoQWUzYj0UWYGgEGU#PPA154,M1  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spectral sensitivity is sometimes expressed as a [[quantum efficiency]], that is, as probability of getting a quantum reaction, such as a captured [[electron]], to a quantum of light, as a function of wavelength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Digital Image Analysis of Microbes: Imaging, Morphometry, Fluorometry and Motility Techniques and Applications | author = M. H. F. Wilkinson | author2 = F. Schut | last-author-amp = yes | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | date = 1998 | ISBN = 0-471-97440-4 | url =  https://books.google.com/books?id=8JJwuU13YPAC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=%22spectral+sensitivity%22++%22quantum+efficiency%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=uXhoX5c9X4u0E-gU8Kkgxqa82QE#PPA60,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other contexts, the spectral sensitivity is expressed as the relative response per light energy, rather than per quantum, normalized to a peak value of 1, and a quantum efficiency is used to calibrate the sensitivity at that peak wavelength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Contrast Sensitivity of the Human Eye and Its Effects on Image Quality | author = Peter G.

During a career that has spanned over 20 years, [[Stephen Norrington]] has worked on projects which never progressed beyond the [[pre-production]] stage under his direction. Many of the films were produced after he left production.

* In 2001, Norrington was originally attached to [[Dimension Films]]'s ''[[Ghost Rider (2007 film)|Ghost Rider]]'' before the project was acquired by [[Columbia Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18676|title=WWII Backdrop, Monsters and 'The Lost Patrol'|publisher=BloodyDisgusting}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Michael|first=Fleming|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117785776.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1|title='Ghost' adds a Dimension|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|date=2000-08-30|accessdate=2006-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was eventually released in 2007 directed by [[Mark Steven Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harris|first=Dana|url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=story&amp;articleid=VR1117884327&amp;categoryid=13&amp;cs=1|title=Johnson sees 'Ghost'|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|date=2003-04-08|accessdate=2006-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Hands of Shang-Chi''===
* In 2001, Norrington announced that he had agreed to direct a film based on ''The Hands of Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu'', a film adaptation based on the Marvel character ''[[:w:c:marvel:Shang-Chi|Shang-Chi]]''. Norrington described the film as "a real honest-to-goodness martial arts film, rather than a film that simply has martial arts in it". In 2004, it was announced that [[Ang Lee]] had been brought on as producer. In 2005, it was announced that Stan Lee had agreed to executive produce the film for DreamWorks, with Yuen Woo-ping directing from a Bruce McKenna screenplay.&lt;ref name="leechiback"&gt;[http://blog.moviefone.com/2006/02/27/ang-lees-shang-chi-movie-is-back/ Ang Lee's Shang-Chi movie is back]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Avi Arad]] stated that he thought that a PG-13 adaptation was possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/shared/movies/interviews/a/arad_avi_062005/ Future Shocks: What's Ahead For Avi Arad and his Marvel empire?]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Ang Lee confirmed his and Yuen's continued involvement with the project.&lt;ref name="leechiback" /&gt; However, no further developments have been announced to date.

===''Akira'' remake===
* Shortly after Warner Bros. acquired the rights in 2002, Stephen Norrington was slated to direct a remake to the 1988 film ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', with [[James Robinson (writer)|James Robinson]] writing the screenplay and [[Dan Lin]] producing.&lt;ref name="ign la 2017"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/06/akira-the-tortured-history-of-the-unmade-live-action-adaptation | title = Akira: The Tortured History of he Unmade Live-Action Adaptation | first = Christopher | last = Marc | date = April 6, 2017 | accessdate = August 31, 2017 | work = [[IGN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/04/12/akira-hollywood-remake]&lt;/ref&gt; Norrington had planned to make the remake more appealing to Western audiences, making Kaneda and Tetsuo brothers. Following the commercial failure of ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' in 2003, which both Norrington and Robinson were also on, the project was put on hold.&lt;ref name="ign la 2017"/&gt;

===''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'' (sequel and reboot)===
* In 2003, Norrington's ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' was intended to spawn a [[Media franchise|film franchise]] based on further titles in the original comic book series, but there was little enthusiasm for a sequel due to performing poorly at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2003/TLOEG.php|title=The Numbers: Box Office Data|publisher=|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sequel was scrapped, ''The Tracking Board'' reported, on May 26, 2015, that 20th Century Fox and [[Davis Entertainment]] had agreed to develop a reboot with hopes of launching a new franchise. The report stated that a search was underway for a director who could help "continue to develop the reboot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tracking-board.com/tb-exclusive-fox-enters-development-on-a-reboot-of-the-league-of-extraordinary-gentlemen/|title={TB EXCLUSIVE} Fox Enters Development on "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" Reboot – The Tracking Board|work=The Tracking Board}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Davis (producer)|John Davis]] told Collider in an interview that the reboot will be a female-centric film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/league-of-extraordinary-gentlemen-reboot-female-centric/|title='League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' Reboot to Be Female-Centric|publisher=Collider|last=Goldberg|first=Matt|date=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, there has not been any further announcements, falling into development hell.

===''Clash of the Titans'' (2010)===
* In 2007, Norrington was originally set to direct the remake of the 1981 fantasy film ''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]''. However, Norrington was unsure about his direction for the project because he did not grow up with the original. [[Louis Leterrier]], who did, contacted Norrington through their shared agent about replacing him. Leterrier's film was released in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Crow To Fly Again: LXG's Norrington to write, direct|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=23871|date=15 December 2008|accessdate=13 January 2009|publisher=Empire Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Fleming, Michael |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117977672.html?categoryid=1238&amp;cs=1 |title=Norrington to direct ''Titans'' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Crow'' (reboot)===
* In 2008, it was announced that Norrington would direct a reboot of ''[[The Crow#In_other_media|The Crow]]'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/19918|title='The Crow' Redo Flying Back to Detroit?|publisher=BloodyDisgusting}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the film by 2013 and was replaced by [[F. Javier Gutiérrez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Sean CW|last=Korsgaard|title=Interview with James O'Barr, creator of The Crow|website=korsgaardscommentary.com|date=October 30, 2014|url=http://www.korsgaardscommentary.com/2014/10/interview-james-obarr-creator-crow.html|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July 2015, Gutiérrez eventually left the project and was replaced by [[Corin Hardy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.screengeek.net/2017/10/29/the-crow-reboot-to-begin-pre-production-in-february/ |title=Exclusive: The Crow Reboot To Begin Pre-Production In February |last=Salcido |first=Mark |date=2017-10-29 |website=Screengeek |access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardy also left the project on May 31, 2018, leaving the film in limbo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/the-crow-remake-dead/|title='The Crow' Remake is Dead Again as Jason Momoa and Corin Hardy Exit|date=2018-05-31|work=/Film|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010s==

===''The Lost Patrol''===
* In 2010, Norrington was going to direct and write the supernatural action thriller ''The Lost Patrol'' to be distributed by [[Legendary Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35313/stephen-norrington-helm-the-lost-patrol-wwii-plus-monsters|title=Stephen Norrington to Helm The Lost Patrol - WWII Plus Monsters!|publisher=DreadCentral}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, there has not been any further development.

'''''Sunset at Montmajour''''' is a landscape in [[oil painting|oils]] painted by the Dutch artist [[Vincent van Gogh]] on July 4, 1888.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24014186 |title=New Vincent Van Gogh painting identified |accessdate=9 September 2013|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AFP1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Long-lost Van Gogh painting unveiled in Amsterdam|url=http://www.afp.com/en/news/topstories/long-lost-van-gogh-painting-unveiled-amsterdam|work=AFP|accessdate=9 September 2013|date=9 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911233449/http://www.afp.com/en/news/topstories/long-lost-van-gogh-painting-unveiled-amsterdam|archivedate=11 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Van Gogh Painting Unveiled in Amsterdam|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/arts/design/new-van-gogh-painting-discovered-in-amsterdam.html?_r=0|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was painted while the artist was at [[Arles]], France and depicts a landscape of [[garrigue]] with the ruins of [[Montmajour Abbey]] in the background.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; The painting is {{convert|73.3|x|93.3|cm|in|abbr=on}} and was on display from 24 September 2013 until 12 January 2014 as part of an exhibition at the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

Its authenticity was questioned several times before it was confirmed as a genuine van Gogh work in 2013. It is the first full-sized painting by Van Gogh to be newly confirmed since 1928.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;&lt;ref name=st&gt;{{cite news|last=Sapa-AFP|title=Long lost Van Gogh discovered|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/thetimes/2013/09/10/long-lost-van-gogh-discovered|accessdate=11 September 2013|newspaper=Sunday Times|date=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The painting was inventoried among [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo van Gogh]]'s collection of his brother's works in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;The painting bears Theo's inventory number: 180.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VGmus/&gt; It was sold in 1901,&lt;ref name=VGmus&gt;{{cite web|title=Van Gogh Museum discovers new painting by Vincent van Gogh: Sunset at Montmajour|url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=330726&amp;lang=en|work=Van Gogh Museum|accessdate=9 September 2013|authorlink=Van Gogh Museum|date=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which there is no enduring record of its ownership or [[provenance]]. The painting seemingly became "lost" though it was purchased shortly thereafter.

In 1908 a [[Norway|Norwegian]] industrialist, [[Christian Nicolai Mustad]], who believed it to be the work of van Gogh,&lt;ref name=AFP1/&gt; purchased and displayed the painting at his home. According to Mustad's family, the French ambassador to [[Sweden]], while a guest at Mustad's home, advised that it probably was not by van Gogh.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; At that time Mustad took it down from display. The painting remained stored in his attic until Mustad's death, when it reappeared as part of his estate.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web|last=Memmott|first=Mark|title='New' Van Gogh Painting Identified; Was in a Norwegian Attic|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/09/09/220625774/|date=9 September 2013|publisher=NPR|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, the painting was shown to staff at the Van Gogh Museum, but it was dismissed as not the work of van Gogh because it was not signed.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; With the development of improved investigative techniques, however, in 2011 a two-year investigation was launched by the Van Gogh Museum to examine the possible authenticity of the painting.&lt;ref name=NYT1&gt;{{cite web|last=Siegal|first=Nina|title=Museum Identifies New Van Gogh Painting in Amsterdam|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/arts/design/new-van-gogh-painting-discovered-in-amsterdam.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1378733687-TfBqJ4zhlBSFDSOo/0huDw|work=New York Times|accessdate=9 September 2013|date=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was subjected to a detailed investigation of style and materials. It was discovered to have been painted in the same range of paints that appears in works by van Gogh at that period,&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; which led to further research. Among the evidence that confirmed the painting's authenticity was [[The Letters of Vincent van Gogh|a letter]] written by Vincent van Gogh to his brother Theo on 5 July 1888, describing a landscape that he had painted the previous day: 
{{quote|"Yesterday, at sunset, I was on a stony heath where very small, twisted oaks grow, in the background a ruin on the hill, and wheatfields in the valley. It was romantic, it couldn’t be more so, à la [[Adolphe Joseph Thomas Monticelli|Monticelli]], the sun was pouring its very yellow rays over the bushes and the ground, absolutely a shower of gold. And all the lines were beautiful, the whole scene had a charming nobility. You wouldn’t have been at all surprised to see knights and ladies suddenly appear, returning from hunting with hawks, or to hear the voice of an old Provençal troubadour. The fields seemed purple, the distances blue.  And I brought back a study of it too, but it was well below what I’d wished to do."&lt;ref name= "Letter 636"&gt;{{cite web|title= Letter 636: To Theo van Gogh.

On 9 September 2013, the Van Gogh Museum announced in a public unveiling of the painting, that the work had been confirmed as a painting by van Gogh.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{citeweb|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/10299372/Van-Goghs-Sunset-at-Montmajour-a-major-addition-to-the-oeuvre.html|title=Van Gogh's Sunset at Montmajour: 'a major addition to the oeuvre'|date=10 September 2013|work=Daily Telegraph UK|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Bailey praised ''Sunset at Montmajour'' as "a major addition to [van Gogh's] oeuvre."&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

Since its release, ''The Guild'' has received several accolades, including six [[Streamy Awards]] and four [[IAWTV Awards]].&lt;ref name="The Guild"&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Guild|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1138475/awards|accessdate=October 3, 2017 |website=IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''The Guild'' was written and created by Felicia Day, an avid [[gamer]], in between acting roles in several American television shows and movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1260407 |title=Felicia Day |website=[[IMDb]] |accessdate= January 31, 2009 |date=n.d. |last=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two years of [[Video game|gaming]], Day decided to make something productive from her experiences and wrote the series as a [[sitcom]] [[television pilot]]. The series was purposely kept generic to avoid copyright problems and to appeal to a wider audience of massively multiplayer online role-playing game ([[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]]) fans, but Day based it on her experience with a ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jøn |first=A. Asbjørn |date=2010 |title=The Development of MMORPG Culture and The Guild |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283281457_The_Development_of_MMORPG_Culture_and_The_Guild |journal=Australian Folklore: A Yearly Journal of Folklore Studies |volume=25 |pages=97–112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day also hoped to show that the stereotypical man living in his parents' basement is not the only kind of gamer. She decided to produce the series online with Jane Selle Morgan and Kim Evey.&lt;ref name="Wired" /&gt; Day already knew Sandeep Parikh and Jeff Lewis from Empty Stage Comedy Theatre, a Los Angeles-based comedy theatre, and their roles were written for them. The rest of the cast was filled through [[audition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wow.com/2007/08/20/interview-with-felicia-day-from-the-guild/|title=Interview with Felicia Day from "The Guild"|last=Holisky |first=Adam |date=August 20, 2007|website=WOW Insider|accessdate=January 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://girlsdontgame.com/2007/09/13/interview-with-felicia-day-of-the-guild/ |title=Girls Don’t Game » Interview with Felicia Day of The Guild |website=Girlsdontgame.com |date=September 13, 2007 |accessdate=March 7, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711095320/http://girlsdontgame.com/2007/09/13/interview-with-felicia-day-of-the-guild/ |archivedate=July 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After filming the first three episodes in two and a half days, they ran out of money. After donations were invited through [[PayPal]], the fourth and fifth episodes were almost solely financed by donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newteevee.com/2007/10/31/the-guild/|title=NewTeeVee Pick: The Guild|last=Wagner |first=James Au|date=October 31, 2007|website=NewTeeVee|accessdate=January 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/dec/14/internet-web-series |title=All smiles as web shows come of age |work=The Guardian |date=December 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Each episode opens with Codex ([[Felicia Day]]) recapping the previous events in the story in the form of a [[video blog]]. Usually, it gives the audience a recap of the previous episode and shares Codex's feelings on the subject. The video blogs appear to be outside the timeline, as she is usually wearing an outfit (typically her pyjamas) different from that in the episode itself, though some blogs take place in the time line with other characters or situations interrupting Codex. Each season is divided into 12 episodes (with the exception of season 1, which is divided into 10 episodes).

==Plot==
{{See also|List of The Guild episodes}}

===Season 1 (2007–2008)===
Cyd Sherman struggles to limit her time online, where she games as her alter ego Codex, a member of the '''Knights of Good'''. After the guild realizes that Zaboo has been offline for 39 hours, he appears on Codex's doorstep. Zaboo misunderstood Codex's in-game chats as [[flirting]], and became a stalker living in the same apartment.

On the in-game side, trouble also arises when Bladezz is banned from the game for using a macro (to spam expletives "a few thousand times") in the trade house. Codex uses this as an excuse to have the guild help her with her Zaboo problem. The guild (except Bladezz) reluctantly meets up in person—for the first time—at Cheesybeards, a local restaurant, only to find out that Vork had transferred all of their in-game valuables to Bladezz's account as part of a [[team building]] strategy. If they decided to kick out Bladezz, they would lose everything.

Things get worse when Bladezz begins to slander the Knights of Good by showing inappropriate videos of the members' characters, and Codex is no closer to getting Zaboo to go home. Then, Zaboo's home comes to him in the form of his overbearing mother. Zaboo confesses that his mother controls every aspect of his life besides the Internet, which she is beginning to read about. He saw this as his only escape.

Codex comes up with a plan to bring Bladezz down, using Zaboo's stalking skills. Zaboo finds out about Bladezz's modelling career and blackmails him into giving the gold and equipment back to the Guild. The Guild then fights off Zaboo's mom, and Bladezz redeems himself by landing the final blow. Codex soon realizes that she got Zaboo's mother's loot- Zaboo.

===Season 2 (2008–2009)===
Zaboo's mother takes revenge for losing Zaboo by having Codex evicted. Codex and Zaboo move into a new apartment, where Codex meets a new love interest: Wade ([[Fernando Chien]]), a [[stunt man]]. Codex tries to get Zaboo to move out by telling him that he needs to level up before they can be together. She arranges for him to live with Vork, who will take in-game gold as rent, something Zaboo is really good at: [[gold farming|farming]]. Codex focuses on trying to get Wade interested in her.

The Guild finds a valuable in-game orb which Clara and Tink fight over. Just as Vork lets it go up for bid, Clara's children unplug her computer from the Internet and, upon re-connecting, Clara finds out Tink wins it. Clara vows revenge on Vork for giving it to Tink and spends an entire weekend betraying Vork by [[Corpse camping#Online role-playing games|corpse camping]] him on an alternate account as well as searching for her own orb.

Bladezz believes Tink is romantically interested in him and begins to max out his mother's credit cards to buy her stuff, when, in fact, Tink is using him to get what she wants. Vork is annoyed with Zaboo's lack of logic and his antics in trying to 'man-up' for Codex. Codex finds out that the stunt-man has a "stupid tall hot girlfriend," Riley ([[Michele Boyd]]).

The Game announces that the online play will be shut down for maintenance for four hours, during which Vork plans a strategy lecture for Zaboo and Bladezz, while Codex plans a quiet party with Clara and Tink. Bladezz coerces Vork to abandon the lecture in favor of a poker game (offline), hoping to make up some of what he spent on Tink. Clara advertises Codex's party and it becomes a crowded kegger.

Among Clara's random invitees, Wade and Riley come to the party. After finding out that Riley is Wade's roommate and Wade is single, Tink and Clara try to hook Codex up with him. Zaboo, learning of this, persuades Vork and Bladezz to go to Codex's party to try to stop it. Vork discovers that Clara has been attacking him, and begins to question his quality of leadership. Bladezz confronts Tink about their relationship; upon learning that he has been used, Bladezz steals Tink's laptop and deletes her character. Meanwhile, Zaboo walks in on Wade and Codex kissing and challenges Wade to a fight. Wade is a much better fighter, but Zaboo's seriousness about Codex leads to Wade giving up his interest in her. Codex yells at Zaboo that she doesn't like him, and he leaves dejected. Then Codex sees a drunken Clara kissing with Wade, and decides to chase after Zaboo to apologize, but is hurt when she sees him making out with Riley.

===Season 3 (2009)===
Codex was able to recover from the disastrous party by the announcement of the new [[expansion pack]] for the game, ''Spires of Dragonor''. The Knights of Good are first in line at [[GameStop]] until a rival guild, the '''Axis of Anarchy''', cuts in front of them. After the Axis tricks a GameStop worker into sending the Knights to the back of line, Vork, still not over the events of the party, resigns as Guild Leader. Codex is elected as his successor, causing Tink to leave the Knights and join the Axis.

While Vork goes on a self-discovery journey, Clara's husband George demands that she spend more time with the family after discovering her gaming has severely distanced her from him. As a result, Clara proposes that he take Tink's place after auditions for a sixth member fail. Riley, who becomes increasingly domineering to Zaboo, offers to join, but Codex chooses Clara's husband instead, adding "Mr. Wiggly" to the Guild. Meanwhile, Bladezz begins to be targeted by Tink and the Axis of Anarchy, who expose his modelling alias to his school and plant weapons in his locker; later, Bruiser (J. Teddy Garcia), a member of the Anarchists, seduces his mom. Codex issues a message on the game's public forum to stand up against the Axis for the behavior, and in retaliation the Axis puts a bounty on the Guild. Mr. Wiggly unknowingly gives away information about the Guild to other gamers in exchange for loot, which leads to his expulsion from the Guild. With this, he tells Clara to quit the game, and she does to save her marriage.

To end the Axis's harassment of Bladezz, Codex and Zaboo track down the Anarchist Valkyrie at his job, where is he playing the game on company time. After they take away some of his character's possessions and threaten to expose him, Valkyrie tells them where and when the next Axis of Anarchy meeting will take place. Vork returns after regaining his confidence to lead and, with Codex, reassembles the Guild to challenge the Axis at the [[Internet café]] where they planned to have a group raid. The battle begins, but both sides lose members quickly. Some of the Knights die in-game when their real-life problems manifest: Clara's husband shows up, angry that she is playing the game; Riley destroys Zaboo's computer for not meeting her demands. Clara tells her husband that they are going to have another child and he forgets about their argument and redeems himself in the eyes of the guild by helping Clara kill the Anarchist Kwan in game. Zaboo breaks up with Riley, who then proceeds to make out with Venom.

Finally, only Codex is left to face off Tink and Axis leader Fawkes ([[Wil Wheaton]]). After Codex makes Bladezz apologize to Tink, Tink decides that the Axis members are even bigger jerks than she can stand and lets Codex kill her in-game. Codex, in a hallucinatory conversation with her game character, musters the courage to defeat Fawkes. The Knights welcome Tink back into the guild, and Bladezz makes tentative peace with the Axis member who seduced his mother. Fawkes invites Codex for drinks; she initially refuses but, in a twist ending, wakes up in bed with him the next morning.

===Season 4 (2010)===
An unexpected and unintentional one-night stand with Fawkes ([[Wil Wheaton]]) causes Codex to stress over what the guild thinks of her and persuades him to cover for her in a pretend relationship. But after spending more time together, Codex realizes he is a "total tool-bag" and reevaluates her criteria for relationships with men. Her computer breaks and she is forced to get a job at Cheesybeards to pay for repairs but has no idea how to fulfil the expectations of her boss, Ollie ([[Frank Ashmore]]).

Zaboo tries to be a good friend to Codex during her fake relationship with Fawkes instead of trying to win her love. He dives into this new pursuit with his usual smothering intensity. When the truth of the relationship is revealed he realizes that his feelings for Codex have changed and he wants to be her friend.

An earnings competition for a new guild hall sparks a real-life business for Tink and Clara that strengthens and strains their friendship.

Vork enlists Zaboo's mother, Avinashi (Viji Nathan), for her "brilliant economic mind" in his pursuit of his vision for the guild's hall and he sets up a stock market and loan company that is bankrupting players. However, her smothering tendencies enrage him to the point that he "make[s] a giant gesture that's really inappropriate" and proposes marriage in an attempt to repulse her. To his horror she accepts.

Codex and Bladezz film an online Cheesybeards commercial but the result is so horrible that it spawns a series of prank calls to the establishment. Ollie is furious and fires Codex. The guild helps Codex get her job back by organizing a celebration at Cheesybeards that attracts a large population of gamers. Bladezz attempts to perform a magic trick involving fire, which ends up torching the restaurant (costing Codex and Bladezz their jobs).

Zaboo begs Codex to intercede in the upcoming nuptials between his mother and Vork. And when Zaboo reveals he has used the money from auctioning a romantic painting of Codex and Fawkes he had commissioned to buy her a new computer she is touched by the gesture and resolves to break up the wedding.

Avinashi and Vork are about to speak their vows to each other, at a virtual wedding ceremony in the newly purchased prison-like Knights of Good guild hall, when all of the guild members object. Codex manages to convince Zaboo's mother that it is wrong to marry "someone [she] can't stand in order to be close to someone who doesn't want to be near [her]". Zaboo helps by suggesting that she visit every few weeks when she gets lonely, causing Codex to realize that he possesses all the qualities on her new litmus test, and consider a relationship with him.

The season wraps up with an official gamemaster crashing the ceremony to put an end to Vork's "Trogothian Stock Market" scheme. Codex convinces the GM, Kevinator ([[Simon Helberg]]), to change the design of the guild hall to the "bitchin' fairy palace" that Tink and Clara wanted. Kevinator is impressed to meet Bladezz, who has become an internet celebrity and invites the whole guild to a gaming convention.

===Season 5 (2011)===
The Knights of Good travel to MegaGameORama-Con, a three-day gaming convention. Bladezz believes that he is invited by Kevinator as a special guest, but his name is not on the invite list. With all nearby hotels booked, Rachel, a member of the convention staff, manages to secure a room for them. However, it is not offered for free, and Bladezz convinces the rest of the guild that he will clarify the situation to Kevinator. Meanwhile, Codex is more interested in getting close to Zaboo, but he becomes engrossed in attending the events and panels.

On the first day of the convention, Bladezz and Vork discover that Kevinator had been fired from The Game before the day of the convention and Bladezz was one of his joke invites. To compensate for hotel fees, both of them start up a photo booth for the Cheeseybeard's pirate. Tink attempts to sell the T-shirts she and Clara made but is forced to find a booth to avoid from being caught by the convention staff for selling without a permit. When she and Clara come upon a [[steampunk]]-themed booth, Clara is more interested in it than selling the shirts. Zaboo is denied entry to a panel because the seats are full, causing him to form a seat-saving network.

Codex tries out the new demo at The Game's booth, but unknowingly insults the creator, Floyd Petrovski (Ted Michaels). She becomes even more preoccupied when Zaboo spurns her advances and is continuously stalked by a convention-goer in a [[fursuit|furry costume]]. When she follows Floyd to apologize, she discovers that he plans to sell The Game to a mainstream market. Codex becomes concerned about the future of the game, which is the only thing in her life holding her friendships together.

Tink, who continuously changes costumes to hide her identity, reveals to Codex at a party that she is hiding from her adoptive family, who have attended the convention, fearing that they will discover her switching majors from pre-med to fashion design. Codex arranges a dinner with her family to reconcile against Tink's will. Meanwhile, Clara tries to join the steampunk group and is trained as their fourth member to help them win the costume contest, but the members of the group ultimately turn her away. Zaboo has become so preoccupied with his seat-saving network that he briefly goes power-hungry. He is stopped by Clara, who brings back his old personality, ending his involvement with the seat-saving network.

Bladezz and Vork's booth becomes successful, but Vork rejects all of the celebrities who want to spend time with Bladezz. His attention, however, is turned towards Madeline ([[Erin Gray]]), an actress who played his favorite character, Charity, on the show ''Time Rings''. The two are invited to a party that night, but Bladezz realizes that all the celebrities lead normal lives, finding them boring. Still, he rejects Rachel and her friends for the celebrities and openly humiliates them. Vork, on the other hand, ends up offending Madeline after he criticizes her decision to leave her show.

The next day, Bladezz has lost all support from the celebrities and his fans, so he is unable to continue the Cheeseybeard pirate's photo booth. Zaboo helps Clara build a steampunk-themed blimp to help her win the costume contest. Codex and Tink discover that Codex's stalker is Fawkes, who wants to join their guild after the Axis of Anarchy broke up, but Codex rejects him. The girls later eavesdrop on Floyd's conversation and discover he plans on revealing his decision at the costume contest that night. Both of them convince the rest of the Guild to help them save The Game from going "freemium". The Guild is able to stop the changes with much success: Clara wins the costume contest, Bladezz is able to win back his fans, and Vork reconciles with Madeline. As all of them leave the convention the next morning, Floyd has decided to give Codex a job.

===Season 6 (2012–2013)===
Codex begins her new job working for Floyd Petrovski at the headquarters for "The Game", only to discover that he's a thoughtless tyrant who immediately turns all the other employees against her. Meanwhile, Tink discovers that the men she manipulated for services and gifts have all slandered her on local websites, losing all of her connections. Bladezz gets kicked out of his house by Bruiser and spends time at Clara's, convincing her long-suffering husband that she is devoted to her children by uploading videos of her parenting to the Internet, though he is more interested in monetizing the videos. Vork, who is dating Madeline, becomes disillusioned when Zaboo uncovers photos of her protesting nude, while Zaboo suffers separation anxiety from the members of the Guild going offline, seeking refuge from a collage of his ideal "sweetheart."

Codex is pressured by her co-workers to convince Floyd to release the underwater expansion pack they have been planning for months but is forced to do menial chores in order to appease him. When the Guild visits her workplace, Tink steals Codex's key to the testing server and initiates a casual relationship with Donovan (Corey Craig), where they agree that he will do chores for her if she spends time with him. Unbeknownst to her, she begins to fall in love with him for real. Zaboo, who enters the server posing as an IT technician, becomes smitten with Sabina ([[Justine Ezarik]]), an [[Non-player character|NPC]] of The Game and the spitting image of his ideal girl.

Vork, who has gotten through with an argument with Madeline about his personal goals, confronts Floyd about his unanswered complaints about The Game. This gets his character permanently banned, and he retaliates by protesting and gaining support from other gamers. Meanwhile, Bladezz is forced to spend time with Wiggly while Clara continues making videos. When Clara becomes Internet-famous, other parents turn to her for advice, one of them being Bladezz's mother. Clara encourages her to keep dating Bruiser, causing Bladezz to convince Wiggly to quit his job.

The underwater expansion patch notes are leaked onto the Internet and wildly rouses the protest. Codex is unsuccessful in finding the culprit but convinces Floyd to release the expansion pack anyway. Donovan reveals to Tink that he was the one who caused the leak in order to push Floyd to release the expansion pack, and Tink tells him that Codex and Vork are in the same guild. He uses this information against Floyd to blame the leak on Codex and gets her fired. Vork's protest culminates in a riot, but his acts have renewed Madeline's faith in him and the two reconcile.

As her final act for Floyd, Codex quells the rioters by questioning their acts and informing that their poor attitudes contributed to the problems at the Game HQ. Floyd unexpectedly steps out and challenges the crowd to insult him to his face instead of typing online insults, but the entire crowd congratulate him on his work and cite their insecurities as part of their bad behaviors. Inspired, Floyd announces a troll-themed add-on for the Game. By the end of the day, Clara is successful in convincing Bruiser to break up with Bladezz's mother and secures a position at a vlogging network, Tink and Donovan begin a relationship, and Zaboo discovers his real-life Sabina. Codex, happy with getting her job back and realizing how much her friends are loyal to her, makes a final vlog and tearily shuts down her computer, bringing the season (and the series) to a close.

}}'''Codex''' (real name Cyd Sherman) is the [[healer (gaming)|Priest]]. Codex is shy and non-confrontational, tending to panic under stress. Outside the game she is a concert violinist (and former [[child prodigy]]), unemployed after setting fire to her boyfriend's cello. She is an addicted gamer who tries at first to control the time she spends online, but fails. For this reason, her therapist drops her. At the beginning of the series she is quite reclusive with no real-life friends; she is often self-conscious and awkward around men. Codex is portrayed by creator [[Felicia Day]].
*'''Zaboo''' (real name Sujan Balakrishnan Goldberg) is the [[Magician (fantasy)|Warlock]]. Zaboo describes himself as a "[[History of the Jews in India|HinJew]]", having a [[Hindu]] mother and [[Jewish]] father. He shows great skill with computers; for example, his [[stalking]] of Codex included obtaining (presumably through the Internet) the [[floor plan]] of her apartment and all her past residences. His obsessive attitude toward Codex reflects his mother's smothering. When talking, Zaboo often uses "-'d" after some key word or expression, self-commenting on what he just said (e.g. bladder'd, testosterone'd). While Zaboo doesn't appear to have a profession, he admits having attended college for four years (to which his mother drove him every day). Zaboo is portrayed by [[Sandeep Parikh]].
*'''Vork''' (real name Herman Holden) is the guild leader and [[Warrior (character class)|Warrior]]. He enjoys managing the guild and budgeting, and believes only in rules and logic. He lives frugally (and illegally) on his late grandfather's [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] checks and is a certified [[notary public]]. When he became Guild Leader he "cut the fats of life" including electric power; he steals his senile neighbor's wifi (and shed), and keeps his food cold by buying ice with [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]]. In the penultimate episode of season 3 he reveals that he can speak fluent [[Korean language|Korean]]; in season 4, he speaks Hindi to Zaboo's mother and claims to know all languages. Vork comes to believe that shared hatred of him is what keeps the guild together. In Season 4, his desire to own a guild hall leads him to manipulating an in-game exchange market, nearly causing him to be banned from the game. Vork is portrayed by [[Jeff Lewis (actor)|Jeff Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1511529 |title=Jeff Lewis (IX) |website=[[IMDb]] |date=n.d.|last=Staff|accessdate=January 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Bladezz''' (real name Simon Kemplar) is the [[thief (character class)|Rogue]]. He is a high school student who spends most of his time outside of school in his mom's garage playing the Game. He is rude to the other male guild members, hits on the female guild members, and often makes lewd sexual jokes and comments. He is shown to be trumped by his tomboyish little sister many times throughout the series. He is worried about being sent to military school, and to save up for college his mom forced him into [[model (person)|modeling]]; using the alias "Finn Smulders" in order to keep it a secret from his fellow high school students. In seasons 4 and 5, he becomes an [[Internet meme]]. Bladezz is portrayed by [[Vincent Caso]].
*'''Clara''' (real name Clara Beane) is the [[Mage (character class)|Frost Mage]]. Clara is a neglectful stay-at-home wife and mother, college partier, and ex-cheerleader. Her three children are all young, with the youngest still [[breastfeeding]]. Though proud of her children, she tends to put gaming before her family, and sometimes tries to mix the two, recruiting her husband "Mr. Wiggly" to the guild. She uses her real name as her avatar name because her kids saw her old name, "Mom-[[Dominatrix|inatrix]]". Clara expresses a ditsy, scatter brained, and eccentric personality with occasional bursts of insight. In the Season 5, Clara proves herself to be a capable mother -figure when she stops Zaboo from going mad with power and lack of sleep. Clara is portrayed by [[Robin Thorsen]].
*'''Tinkerballa''' (real name April Lou) is the [[Ranger (character class)|Ranger]]. Tink distances herself from the guild, trying not to let them know anything about her personal life, she even keeps her real name a secret from her fellow guildies introducing herself as Tinkerballa. Her real name isn't revealed until the fifth season. In reality, Tink is adopted and has two caucasian sisters. She also has been lying to her parents about being a pre-med student, when she has actually switched courses for a degree in costume design. She is shown to have a huge video game addiction, always having an alternate game in hand when not playing the guild's game, even when raiding. She is cold and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]], and uses men to get what she wants, including Bladezz who deletes Tink's character to avenge himself after being used by Tink. Following this, and Vork's refusal to punish Bladezz, she leaves the Knights of Good and joins the Axis of Anarchy, but later finds them too "douchey" even for her (she even says that she went on a date with Fawkes to join). She rejoins the Knights of Good during an in-game showdown with the Axis of Anarchy when they call her "Tainterballa" and she allows her avatar to be killed off intentionally to give Codex the shot at victory for the guild. Tink is revealed to be possibly the most social of the group although is incredibly grounded in the online world. In Season 5, Codex reunites Tink with her family at the gaming con. Tink is portrayed by [[Amy Okuda]].

====Temporary members====
*'''Mr. Wiggly''' (real name George Beane) is a [[Ranger (character class)|Hunter]]. He is Clara's husband, nominated by Clara to replace Tink in Season 3; Codex hastily accepts him in order to prevent Zaboo from recruiting Riley. He is clearly inexperienced in gaming, mentioning that the last game he played was ''[[Pong]]'' (which Bladezz was unfamiliar with). Mr. Wiggly wants to spend time with Clara, but is at his wits' end with her distraction and infidelity. George is shown to be a conventional man who has a sense of responsibility, helping Clara when she spontaneously starts a gamer company. He is displeased when Clara leaves unannounced for the gaming con. Mr. Wiggly is played by [[Brett Sheridan]].

===Axis of Anarchy===
*'''Fawkes''' is the leader of the Axis of Anarchy. He always wears a black [[kilt]] and often wears a black "Axis of Anarchy" T-shirt. In person he speaks with a cool, calm, almost polite tone, though he is prone to angered outbursts when online. He seems to be quite educated as well, as he is constantly quoting philosophers, authors, or figures of history. He often demonstrates that he does not believe in following rules, unless it benefits him. Because of their top ranking, he expects constant perfection from his guild. He is also quite full of himself and manipulative, convincing people they are into him. After the Knights of Good defeat the Axis of Anarchy at the end of Season 3, Fawkes invites Codex for drinks and although she doesn't intend to go, she does and ends up having a one-night stand with him. Attempting to justify this to herself and the Guild, she tries seeing where a relationship with Fawkes would go but he claims he is uninterested in dating and eventually she dumps him. However it emerges that Fawkes has developed feelings for Codex and asks her out properly, but she turns him down flatly. He returns in Season 5, revealing that the Axis broke up (claiming no fault of his own). Fawkes is played by [[Wil Wheaton]].
*'''Venom''' is the only woman in her guild, until Tink joins. She is a [[paraplegic]] and uses a wheelchair, but seems to have no problem exploiting her disability for personal gain. She has a violent attitude and seems to dislike her guildmates. On at least two occasions she threatens suicide to get her way, and, when her character is killed in-game, [[sadomasochism|feels ecstasy]] at this vicarious death. She works as a substitute art teacher at Bladezz's high school. Played by [[Teal Sherer]].
*'''Bruiser''' is the guild's healer, and a corrupt [[police officer]]. Bruiser is probably the largest, loudest, and most vulgar member of the Axis. He had sex with Bladezz's mother to torment Bladezz, and in Season 6 is continuing to see her. Played by [[J. Teddy Garces]].
*'''Kwan''' is a champion ''[[StarCraft]]'' player and earns millions playing in [[South Korea]]. He only speaks [[Korean language|Korean]], and has a female assistant named Nik (played by Toni Lee) who massages his hands and translates for him. He seems to be able to understand some English, and it's possible that Fawkes can understand some of what he says (as his translator does not translate what Kwan says into English). Played by Alexander Yi.
*'''Valkyrie''' (alt-character Artemis) is the attempted joker of the guild, though his jokes seem to be funny only to himself. Based on dialogue with his off-screen boss, he works for some form of design or decorating firm&amp;nbsp;– he claimed to be dealing with a client whose [[damask]] came in the wrong color. He also has web skills, claiming to be the one who created finnsmulders.com. He also plays two girl characters because he claims to like looking at girls, although it is strongly implied he might be a [[closeted|closet homosexual]]. Played by Mike Rose.

===Game HQ===
*'''Floyd Petrovski''' is the creator of the Game and head of the company that produces it. While at Megagame-o-ramacon Floyd overhears Codex criticize parts of the upgrades available for playtest at the convention. After Codex apologizes for her comments and gathers the guild together to interfere with the Game's sale to a larger company, Floyd recognizes Codex's passion for the Game, and hires her as an assistant. Floyd proves to be a difficult boss, quickly alienating Codex from much of the staff. Floyd is played by Ted Michaels.
*'''Roy Aquino '''(Derek Basco), the graphic designer of the Game. On Codex's first day, Floyd lets her have Roy's office without his permission, causing Roy to dislike Codex from the very start. He subtly harasses Codex with drawings and bulletins. He is shown to have a stutter when under stress.
*'''Theodora''' (Alexandra Hoover), the Game [[Chief operating officer|COO]] and head producer. Despite being austere and cold-hearted, she is also extremely clumsy and tends to cover this up with awkward recoveries.
*'''Sula Morrison '''(Sujata Day), the hyperactive community coordinator. She wears glasses despite not having any vision impairment, claiming they make her appear smarter.
*'''Donovan''' (Corey Craig), the lead programmer and nephew to Floyd. Despite being handsome and athletic, he avoids people most of the time; Floyd describes him as a [[:wikt:savant|savant]] and Tink questions whether he has [[Asperger's Syndrome]] or not. Tink, nonetheless, gets him into doing her homework and yet develops feelings for him.  He graduated top of his class from [[Caltech]].

===Other characters===
*'''Zaboo's mother''' (Avinashi Goldberg) epitomizes the over-controlling mother. She had Zaboo [[Microchip implant (animal)|microchipped]] to keep track of his movements, punches Codex for (in her belief) trying to take her son away from her, manipulates him through a series of probably false ailments, and gets Codex evicted for helping him break free of her. She returns in Season 4, attempting to develop a real relationship with her son and ends up assisting Vork in earning gold to purchase a deluxe guild hall. She does manage to reconcile with Zaboo. She is played by Viji Nathan.
*'''Dena''' is Bladezz' precocious little sister. She is first seen when she arrives at the table at Cheesybeards, just after Bladezz has informed the Guildies that he is in control of all the Guild gold and equipment, ruining his big exit. Dena often practices playing bass guitar in Bladezz' basement, to his annoyance, and reads [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]'' (along with building Civil War dioramas). In Season 4, she trained Bladezz in being an actor (calling him terrible). Dena is played by Tara Caso, the sister of [[Vincent Caso]] who plays Bladezz.
*'''Wade Wei''' is Codex's attractive neighbor and brief love interest. Not a gamer himself, Wade works as a [[martial arts]] stunt double; on first meeting Codex, he bumps into her and falls down some stairs, practicing a new stunt. He's fond of showing off his moves and flirting with Codex, making her extremely nervous. Having a queasy stomach, Codex vomits on him upon seeing him in makeup from a zombie movie he is playing in. He harbors a revulsion for gamers, expressing his desire to punch them. Ironically, he describes Codex's gaming-derived knowledge of weaponry as "sexy," though it is worth noting that she does not explain how she knows so much about weapons when he makes the compliment. In episode 10 of season 2, it was revealed that he did [[motion capture]] stunt work for the Game. Wade is played by Fernando Chien.
*'''Riley''' is Wade's [[wikt:friend with benefits|roommate with benefits]] and temporarily dated Zaboo. Riley is an [[First-person shooter|FPS]] gamer and is ranked in [[Halo (series)|Halo]] on [[Xbox Live]]. Riley is very [[BDSM|dominant]] and enjoys submissive underdogs like Zaboo, and later Codex. At first she was thrilled to meet Codex, another girl gamer, until after she learned that Codex was an [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] player, the two began a grudging rivalry. This parodies the normal relationship between [[Multiplayer online game|MOG]] and MMORPG players. In the finale of Season 3, Riley straddles Venom and starts making out with her to get back at Zaboo for breaking up with her. Riley and Venom then start a relationship, which goes well into Season 4 Episode 10, where they're seen discussing Wench outfits. The character of Riley is based off [[Team Unicorn]] member, Rileah Vanderbilt, and played by [[Team Unicorn]] member [[Michele Boyd]].
*'''Ollie''' is the manager of Cheesybeards. He runs his restaurant in a very casual style, allowing Bladezz to use a computer while working at the grill. He speaks entirely in pirate-slang and uses a hook on his left hand (which is hinted to be real). Ollie is responsible for Codex getting a job at the restaurant, after she says she can improve advertising and increase business (though Bladezz sabotages these efforts). Ollie is slightly at odds with Jeannete, who strongly disapproves of Bladezz's slacker work ethic. He first appeared in episode 3 of season 4 and is played by [[Frank Ashmore]].
*'''Jeanette''' is Bladezz's superior at Cheesybeards. She is fed up with his horrible work ethic, but is at odds with Ollie (who is okay with Bladezz). At the end of Season 4, it is revealed she was one of Fawkes' one-night stands and proceeds to beat him up (as she knows [[mixed martial arts]]). Jeanette was the first new character to appear in Season 4 and was played by Tymberlee Hill.
*'''Kevinator''' is the official [[gamemaster]] of the Game who appears at the end of Season 4 to undo Vork ruining the in game economy by hoarding craft items and selling them for massively inflated prices. Kevinator displays a high level of narcissism over his role, proclaiming ‘I am a god!’ before shooting lightning bolts around while giggling manically. After recognising Bladezz from the Cheesy Beards commercial and becoming friends, he provides the Knights of Good with tickets for a gaming convention focused on The Game. However, in Season 5, it is revealed that Kevinator was fired from the game just before the convention for unfair play. In addition, the invite for Bladezz turns out to be a joke, as he has a habit of inviting internet memes for his boss. Kevinator is played by [[Simon Helberg]].
*'''Rachel''' is one of the staff members at Megagame-o-ramacon. She is amazed with meeting Bladezz (barely able to contain her excitement when meeting him), going out of her way to help get the Guild a room. The next day, Rachel is forced to get Tink and Clara to stop selling their shirts (with the help of stormtroopers). After being stood up by Bladezz she and her friends harass him by picketing and wrecking his booth at the convention, though Bladezz does manage to apologize later. She is played by Hayley Holmes.
*'''Madeline Twain''' is a guest of Megagame-o-ramacon, an actress regarded as legendary among the fans of the convention. The former heroine of the long ago cancelled science fiction television series "Time Rings", Madeline serves as mistress of ceremonies at the con's costume contest. Vork, revealed as a former head of the star's fan club, is still smitten with her, though somewhat resentful about her abrupt exit from the series. In Season 6, Vork and Madeline begin dating. Madeline is played by [[Erin Gray]].

==Production notes==

===Season 1===
''The Guild'' was originally intended to be a pilot episode for a TV series, but Felicia Day was advised that it would be much more suited for a web series. The show changed its format and script to fit a web series. The first episode [[List of The Guild episodes#Season 1 (2007–2008)|"Wake-Up Call"]] premiered on YouTube on July 27, 2007. After the first three episodes, the group ran out of money; but a link to Day's [[PayPal]] brought enough donations to fund "Cheesybeards" and "Rather Be Raiding". The first season ended on May 15, 2008, consisting of 10 episodes and two specials (including the Christmas special, "Christmas Raid Carol").

''The Guild'' season 1 DVD was released on [[Amazon.com]] on May 19, 2009. For Canadian audiences, it was bundled with season 2, released on September 29, 2009, also available on Amazon.com.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4920">'''The Image Expedition''' is an American not-for-profit organization that produces multi-platform projects, which serve to photograph and document [[indigenous peoples|indigenous ways of life]] that are at risk of disappearing.&lt;ref&gt;John Ferri, [http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2000-11-23/calendar/good-grind/ Good Grind: The authors of The Birth of Coffee appear in West Palm Beach], ''[[New Times Broward-Palm Beach]]'', November 23, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Their projects use fine art photography, museum-quality exhibitions, digital video, websites, and explanatory text.

==Background==
The Image Expedition was founded in 1990 by [[Daniel Lorenzetti]], funded in part by a grant which Lorenzetti had recently been awarded by the South Florida Cultural Consortium's Visual Artist Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.trustedpartner.com/docs/library/000174/SFCC.pdf South Florida Cultural Consortium's list of past award recipients].&lt;/ref&gt; The editorial director of the Image Expedition is Daniel's wife, Linda Rice Lorenzetti, whose writing has been published in ''The Adventure of Food: True Stories of Eating Everything'' (Travelers' Tales, 1999),  and ''[[The Birth of Coffee]]'' (Random House, 2001).

The Image Expedition states that they are committed to respecting and not imposing upon the cultures that they visit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imageexpedition.com/html/projects.htm Projects page on the Image Expedition website].&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Lorenzetti has said, "As Americans, we can't pretend to understand many of these people's lives.  We can only observe them."&lt;ref name="The Palm Beach Post 1998"&gt;"The Vanishing Cultures", Arts and Entertainment section of ''[[The Palm Beach Post]]'', May 31, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main goal of the organization is to create 'visual artifacts' — "''words and images that document ancient sites, unusual occupations and traditional ways of life, many disappearing in the digital age.''"&lt;ref name="The Palm Beach Post 1998"/&gt; Examples of visual artifacts preserved by the Image Expedition range from cricket sellers in Beijing's public markets, to the Mingangkabau in Indonesia — one of the last existing matrilineal cultures, to duckherders in Burma, to public human cremation in Bali, to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;''Collecting Visual Artifacts'', [[IX/Lighthouse Press]], 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
The Image Expedition's pilot project was a one-month trip to Ecuador in 1990, during which they documented diverse communities within the country, from the Andes mountains to the Amazon basin.  In 1995 the team traveled to document rural areas of China, Yemen, Cambodia, and Burma.  In 1996 the team spent two months photographing and gathering stories from Indonesia, specifically the islands of Bali, Java, Sumatra, Kalimatan and Sulawesi. All of the above research culminated in the publication of ''Collecting Visual Artifacts'', published by IX/Lighthouse Press in 1998.&lt;ref name="The Palm Beach Post 1998"/&gt;

Research for their second project, [[The Birth of Coffee]], began in 1996.&lt;ref name="The Palm Beach Post 1998"/&gt; The aim of this project is to help the average coffee-drinker to be aware of the difficult process that laborers must endure in order to grow and produce coffee.  A book of their findings from this expedition, ''[[The Birth of Coffee]]'', was published by [[Random House]] in 2001.

==Sponsors==

'''''We, Too, Have a Job to Do''''' is a painting by American illustrator [[Norman Rockwell]] that depicts a [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] in full uniform standing in front of a waving [[Flag of the United States|American flag]]. It was originally created by Rockwell in 1942 for the 1944 [[Brown &amp; Bigelow]] Boy Scout Calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = We, Too, Have a Job To Do|url = https://history.lds.org/media/we-too-have-a-job-to-do-brown-and-bigelow?lang=eng#1|website = Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints History|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model, Bob Hamilton, won a contest to be in the painting and personally delivered a print to the [[Vice President of the United States]] at the time, [[Henry A. Wallace]].
 
== Creation ==
The painting was created to encourage Scouts to participate in the [[war effort]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The name of the painting, ''We, Too, Have a Job to Do'', comes from a slogan that the Boy Scouts of America used in 1942 to rally scouts to support the troops by collecting metal and planting [[victory garden]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = We Too Have A Job To Do!|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aQteiT0ObU8C|publisher = Boy Scouts of America|date = 1942-03-01|first = James E|last = West|work = Boys' Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model, Bob Hamilton, won a contest with his local council in [[Albany, New York]], to be depicted in the painting.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = World War II icon dies at 82: Rockwell model inspired scouts to aid country, community|last = Monteleone|first = James|date = August 3, 2008|work = Farmington Daily Times|access-date = |via = LexisNexis}}&lt;/ref&gt; He traveled to Rockwell's studio in [[Arlington, Vermont]], to model for Rockwell.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since Hamilton was a scout, the uniform shown in the painting was his, unlike some of Rockwell's other models. Originally, he wore a turtle shell [[Woggle|neckerchief slide]] with his uniform that he had made. Rockwell did not like it and asked Hamilton to swap it for a simpler [[Turk's head knot|Turk's head]] slide.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1944, Hamilton personally delivered a copy of the painting to Vice President Henry A. Wallace.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Hamilton later became an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]], served in the [[US Navy|Navy]], and worked for the Boy Scouts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He died in July 2008, at the age of 82.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.abqjournal.com/news/state/aprockwell08-04-08.htm |title=Model for Rockwell Boy Scout Painting Dies at 82  |newspaper=[[Albuquerque Journal]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=August 4, 2008  |accessdate=May 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
The painting depicts a Boy Scout giving the [[Scout sign and salute|Scout salute]]; behind him is an American flag, rippling in an unseen breeze.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Brave, Trustworthy, Loyal, Obedient Norman Rockwell's Reverent Portraits of America's Youthful Ideal|last = Allen|first = Henry|date = April 26, 1996|work = Washington Post|access-date = |via = LexisNexis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scout's face is solemn yet confident.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=266&amp;dat=20080805&amp;id=EKs0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=62wFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3393,4737539&amp;hl=en|title = Arthur Robert "Bob" Hamilton|last = |first = |date = August 5, 2008|work = Kentucky New Era|access-date = |via = |agency = Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brown eyes, cleft chin, and idealized face stand out to the viewer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Scout's uniform is perfect, with a [[campaign hat]], showing that he is a [[First Class Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|First Class Scout]]. A [[Cub Scout#Organization|Den Chief]] cord hangs over the Scout's right shoulder, and a backpack hangs over his left shoulder.

== Meaning ==
The painting represents the idea that there is always work to be done in a Scout's neighborhood and that it is a Scout's duty to do it.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The book was published by [[Plume (publisher)|Plume]] and released on May 26, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Putnam|first1=Lindsay|title=Mamrie Hart is YouTube’s raunchiest — and booziest — star|url=https://nypost.com/2015/05/26/mamrie-hart-is-youtubes-raunchiest-and-booziest-star/|publisher=New York Daily News|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Library of Congress LCCN Permalink for 2015004927|url=http://lccn.loc.gov/2015004927|website=lccn.loc.gov|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The book details humorous anecdotes and stories of Hart's life, with a cocktail recipe accompanying each chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YouTube star and author Mamrie Hart made us a custom cocktail|url=http://fusion.net/video/139914/youtube-star-and-author-mamrie-hart-made-us-a-custom-cocktail/|publisher=Fusion|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
''You Deserve a Drink'' was generally well-received by reviewers. Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', actor and comedian [[Michael Ian Black]] stated that "Hart is a pull-no-punches comedian with a talent for self-deprecation in the guise of self-aggrandizement, a winning formula."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Black|first1=Michael|title=Humor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/books/review/humor.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colleen Stinchcombe, writer for [[SheKnows Media|She Knows]] said that "She is undeniably a funny lady, and her humor translates beautifully — even more powerfully, I'd argue — to the page. Her jokes have more time to build, her punchlines land harder. She's created an entirely hilarious read that will delight her current fans by giving them a pitcher-sized serving of her normally shot-sized jokes and entice new readers who have enjoyed recent books by other humor heavy-hitters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stinchcombe|first1=Colleen|title=Mamrie Hart's new memoir is a hilarious lesson in radical self-acceptance|url=http://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/1084050/you-deserve-a-drink-is-a-book-about-radical-self-acceptance|publisher=She Knows|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
