A specialist form of [[business intelligence]], '''accounting intelligence''' is the general name for the set of technologies used to extract, analyse and present information from accounting and [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] applications such as [[JD Edwards]], [[Oracle E-Business Suite]] or [[SAP AG|SAP]].

==Accounting intelligence compared to business intelligence==
Accounting intelligence differs from standard business intelligence in some key ways:-

* Accounting intelligence applications are specifically designed to analyse data from specific ERP systems. Business intelligence is a more general tool that can be applied to any application that uses a database.
* In an accounting intelligence, there is no staggering of data in a [[data warehouse]] or [[OLAP]] cube. Information is extracted directly from the ERP at the time that a query is run.  A Business Intelligence application typically involves a batch process to extract data from the live database, and store it in a denormalised form. This process is normally referred to as [[extract, transform, load]], or ETL. Typically around 75-80% of the development cost expended when creating a business intelligence system, goes into the design and development of the ETL process.
* Accounting intelligence applications leverage the structure of the chart of accounts and other dimensions, so for example dimension structures can be automatically created based on inbuilt hierarchies, level of detail or account category codes. Time-based functions specifically allow for Year to Date, Cumulative, Period, rolling average and year on year analysis.
* Querying an accounts database directly means the information returned is up to the second real time data.  Discrepancies in the accounts can be corrected and a fresh trial balance, P&amp;L or Balance Sheet viewed immediately. Some aggregation in accounting systems is performed by the ERP when new journal entries are posted, so there is no need to use a cube to aggregate every journal entry from scratch.
* As there is no ETL process, accounting intelligence solutions are typically much simpler to install, implement and maintain than traditional business intelligence solutions. Inquiries and reports typically created by end users rather than software developers.
* Accounting intelligence solutions can make [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act|SOX]] compliance easier for many companies, as there is no need to separately audit both the accounts themselves and a separate data warehouse and ETL process.

'''Key advantages compared to business intelligence'''

* Accounting intelligence system ensures that an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is the single source of all operational reporting and analysis, and that it can be relied upon to give accurate and secure information.
* Out of the box solution, much quicker to implement than a standard BI solution.
* As there is no data warehouse, there is no need to separately audit the staged data.
* Data returned is real time, live data, not a snapshot.

'''Key disadvantages compared to business intelligence'''

* Can only be applied to specific ERP systems, such as JDE, Oracle E-Business and SAP.
* Can not integrate data from outside the ERP system.

'''Akuila Savu''' (1944–2014) was a Fijian economist and a native of [[Vanua Balavu]] in the [[Lau Islands|Lau Province]]. 

== Career ==
He served at the Central Planning Office as Director of Economic Planning before his stint as Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of [[Air Pacific]] in 1980. In the 1990s, Savu was the Executive Chairman of the Ports Authority of Fiji. He later became a board member of the Yatu Lau Company, owned by the people of Lau Province.

=== Air Pacific ===
Within a year of becoming CEO, Savu reducing staff and services and formulating a recovery plan to reduce Air Pacific's expected $6 million loss to $4 million. This plan included the [[Politics of Fiji|Fiji Government]] buying back shares owned by Pacific Island Countries to make the company wholly owned by Fiji. In an interview with the [[New York Times|''New York Times'']] in October 1981, Savu said, "If you look at the shareholdings, the intention was that we would be a regional airline." But, with most Pacific islands forming their own national airlines he added that,"Our shareholders are competing against themselves." His five-year plan included the purchase of the airline's first $17 million [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-200]] and replacement of inefficient aircraft due to underestimated competition from Australia and New Zealand and the special needs of operating aircraft in the Pacific. The commercial airline was not subsidized and instead they borrowed money, leading to problems Savu highlighted in the same interview,"You have to borrow, you end up with high interest and a short repayment period." 

=== Ports Authority ===
In 1994, Akuila Savu launched an internal inquiry into the finances of the Ports Authority, but did not make its outcome public. He was criticized by the [[Leader of the Opposition (Fiji)|leader of the opposition]], [[Mahendra Chaudhry]], for this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yatulau.com.fj/index.php?page=board-members]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/24/business/new-pacific-industry-airlines.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Yatu Lau Company ===
After retiring from Ports Authority and until his death, Akuila was Deputy Chairman and Company Secretary of the Yatu Lau Company, under the chairmanship of First Lady [[Adi (title)|Adi]] [[Koila Nailatikau]]. In a 2014 interview with ''Fiji Sun'', Savu announced the company had set up a committee to look into the possibility of a listing in the [[South Pacific Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;[First you can trade your shares and secondly, there can be capital being raised publicly which will mean additional funding]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2889">'''Alfred Edments''' (17 October 1853 – 13 July 1909) was a merchant and [[philanthropist]] in [[Australia]].

==Early life and education==
Edments was born in [[London]], the son of James Edments, a labourer, and his wife Ann, ''née'' Lyons.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080437b.htm |title=Edments, Alfred (1853 - 1909) |accessdate=2008-10-09 |author=Neilma Sidney |work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], Volume 8 |publisher=[[Melbourne University Press|MUP]] |year=1981 |pages=412–413}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had only a primary education and at an early age began to work for a firm of cork merchants.

==Career==
He left for [[Australia]] at the age of 19 and arrived at [[Sydney]]. He obtained a position, saved a little money, began working as a peddler in a small way, and then opened a shop in Sydney where he sold goods by auction. Edments went to [[Melbourne]] in 1888 and started an auction room in [[Bourke Street, Melbourne]]. He also for a short period was a [[bookmaker]], attending only the principal meetings, but found this did not suit his health and soon gave it up. He also gave up having auctions and opened a shop selling watches, clocks and fancy goods, which steadily prospered. He visited England in 1892 to arrange for direct buying, and after trying various locations, finally settled his place of business at 309-311 Bourke Street, Melbourne,&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; in 1895.

The business grew and Edments began to open branches in the suburbs and in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]].  He kept a close watch on every detail, thoroughly trained his staff, and treated them with great consideration.

==Employee management==
Every employee had a fortnight's holiday on full pay, and when ill, Edments continued to pay their salaries and often their medical fees.

==Legacy==
He himself worked very hard and his health began to cause anxiety when he was only in his early forties. He paid frequent visits to England and in 1898 opened a London office. For the last six months of his life he was compelled to manage his business from his home. Edments died at Melbourne on 13 July 1909 of heart disease.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; He married but had no children. At his death left a large proportion of his considerable fortune to charity via the Alfred Edments Trust.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; This in 1940 amounted to about £150,000 and about £6000 is distributed every year. The rest of his fortune was left to his niece E Dench who had no children and left her fortune at her death to [[Ewen Middlemiss]] estimated at the time to be $20 million.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1140">An '''alternate director''' is an individual who is appointed to attend a [[meeting|board meeting]] on behalf of the [[board of directors|director]] of a [[company (law)|company]] where the principal director would be otherwise unable to attend.  The law relating to alternate directors varies from country to country, but in most jurisdictions, the alternate director has the same powers to attend, speak and vote at meetings as the principal director would have had, had the alternate not been appointed.

In some jurisdictions, the alternate must also be a director in his or her own right (so in effect, there would be one less person at the meeting, but the director who had also been appointed as an alternate would carry two votes).  However such structures are not common in developed legal systems.

The appointment of a temporary alternate is one of the few exceptions to the general rule that the office of a director is not assignable and non-delegable.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the United Kingdom, see section 308 of the Companies Act 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''American College Personnel Association - College Student Educators International''' is a major [[student affairs]] association headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]] at the [[National Center for Higher Education]].

Founded in 1924 by [[May L. Cheney]], ACPA has 7,500 members representing 1,200 private and public institutions from across the U.S. and around the world. Members include organizations and companies that are engaged in the campus marketplace. Members also include graduate and undergraduate students enrolled in student affairs/higher education administration programs, faculty, and student affairs professionals, from entry level to senior student affairs officers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myacpa.org/au/au_index.cfm ACPA Website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219091154/http://www.myacpa.org/au/au_index.cfm |date=2008-12-19 }}.  September, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Annual convention ==

Nearly 50% of ACPA's members attend the convention. Highlights of the convention include pre-convention workshops, over 300 educational sessions, interviewing at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611112731/http://careercentral.myacpa.org/home/index.cfm?site_id=8582], volunteering and networking opportunities. During the convention, job applicants and employers participate in one of the largest and most comprehensive placement service in student affairs. The 2013 convention will be in Las Vegas (2013), chaired by Karen Warren-Coleman (University of Chicago).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myacpa.org/convention/upcoming.cfm ACPA Website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219163126/http://www.myacpa.org/convention/upcoming.cfm |date=2008-12-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2012 Louisville Convention was chaired by Steve Sutton (University of California at Berkeley). Past convention chairs include Patricia Perillo (Virginia Polytechnic Institute &amp; State University) for 2011, Robin Diana (Hartwick College) for 2010, Jonathan Poullard (University of California at Berkeley) for 2009, and Sue Saunders (University of Connecticut) for 2008.

== History ==

'''1924''' - [[May L. Cheney]], who organized a teacher placement office at the University of California, Berkeley helped form the National Association of Appointment Secretaries (NAAS). In 1924, NAAS met for the first time and came as guests of the [[National Association of Deans of Women]] (NADW) to a convention sponsored by the Department Superintendence of the National Education Association.

'''1929''' - Forty-six NAAS members registered for the Sixth Annual Convention. NAAS became the National Association of Personnel and Placement Officers (NAPPO).

'''1930s''' - The name [http://www.myacpa.org American College Personnel Association] (ACPA) was adopted in 1931. Association communication consisted of one mailed newsletter, the Personnel-O-Gram (P-O-G). In 1937, the Student Point of View statement was developed by leaders of the [http://www.acenet.edu American Council on Education] (ACE) and ACPA.

'''1940s''' - The Journal for Educational and Psychological Measurement (EPM) became the next form of the association's newsletter communication in 1943. In 1947, ACPA's President Daniel D. Feder's recommendation for formal unification efforts led to the formation of the American Personnel and Guidance Association (APGA). No conferences were held from 1943 through 1945 during World War Two.

'''1950s''' - The Personnel and Guidance Journal replaced EPM as ACPA's official journal in 1952. ACPA members approved the plan to form APGA. Membership reached 1,000 in 1952 and continued to increase through the next two decades. In 1959, Charles Lewis, the P-O-G associate editor was named the first editor of the Journal of College Student Personnel, ACPA's new official journal.

'''1970s''' - ACPA collaborated with other national organizations on many national conventions. In 1973, ACPA and NAWDC (formerly NADW) coordinated a national convention. The Standing Committee for Women was established in 1973. In 1974, NAWDAC (name change for NAWDC), NASPA and ACPA coordinated a national convention. In 1976, membership totaled 9,384 at a record high. The Standing Committee for Multicultural Affairs was founded in 1978. In 1979, ACPA became one of the first members of the  [[Council for the Advancement of Standards in Higher Education]] (CAS).

'''1980s''' - ACPA flourished under the presidential leadership of outstanding student affairs practitioners and faculty members such as Susan Komives, Margaret "Peggy" Barr and Dennis Roberts. In 1983, ACPA was incorporated under the District of Columbia Non-Profit Act. In 1987, ACPA and NASPA held a joint meeting in Chicago to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of The Student Personnel Point of View statement. In 1988, ACPA's premier journal was renamed [https://web.archive.org/web/20070827071906/http://www.myacpa.org/pub/pub_jcsd.cfm THE JOURNAL COLLEGE STUDENT DEVELOPMENT] (JCSD).

'''1990s''' - In 1991, after 40 years, ACPA leaders and members voted to disaffiliate from APGA, which was known as the American Association for Counseling and Development (AACD), and was later renamed the American Counseling Association (ACA). In September 1992, the separation became effective, and ACPA moved into a new office space at the National Center for Higher Education in Washington, D.C. Presidents Leila V. Moore (1991–92), Terry E. Williams (1992–93), Charles C. Schroeder (1986–87), Barbara Anderson (1994–95) and Harold E. Cheatham (1995–96) were all involved in this tremendous undertaking.

'''Early 2000''' - In 2003, Carmen Neuberger retired as Executive Director. Gregory Roberts, ACPA President from 1999–2000, was selected as the new Executive Director.

'''2010''' - The ACPA/NASPA Professional Competency Areas document was published by the Joint Task Force on Professional Competencies and Standards.

'''2011''' - After more than two years of work by the Consolidation Steering Team from ACPA and NASPA leaders, a voting process took place in March. Eighty-percent of ACPA members voted affirmed consolidation while eligible NASPA members who voted fell short of the required 2/3 majority. In the July/August 2011 issue of the Journal of Higher Education, ACPA's premier publication, THE JOURNAL OF COLLEGE STUDENT DEVELOPMENT (JCSD) is ranked fourth among 50 Tier One journals in higher education. In a study by Nathaniel Bray and Claire Major, 106 out of 144 respondents reported that they read JCSD, and more than half of them cited JCSD in their work. This report continues JCSD's streak as the highest ranked journal in student affairs.

'''2012''' - ACPA appointed the [http://www2.myacpa.org/acpa-appoints-credentialing-implementation-team Credentialing Implementation Team], launched the [http://www2.myacpa.org/acpa-announces-institutional-leadership-councils-program Institutional Councils Program] and published its on-going [http://www2.myacpa.org/global-initiatives Global Initiatives].

* ''The Journal for College Student Development''[http://www.jcsdonline.org/] (JCSD) is the highest ranked indexed student affairs journal in the United States [http://www.journal-ranking.com/ranking/listCommonRanking.html?selfCitationWeight=1&amp;externalCitationWeight=1&amp;citingStartYear=1901&amp;journalListId=416]. Published quarterly by ACPA and the Johns Hopkins University Press, JCSD is available online in most American educational libraries. In the July/August 2011 issue of the Journal of Higher Education, JCSD is ranked fourth among 50 Tier One journals in higher education. In a study by Nathaniel Bray and Claire Major, 106 out of 144 respondents reported that they read JCSD, and more than half of them cited JCSD in their work. Complimentary printed copies are mailed to the majority of the membership.
* ''About Campus''[https://web.archive.org/web/20090517201424/http://www.myacpa.org/pub/About-Campus/abstracts.cfm] is a bimonthly magazine for those who want to thoughtfully examine the issues, policies, and practices that influence the learning experiences of college students. Even though About Campus is sponsored by ACPA, it addresses an audience that goes well beyond student affairs to include all those on campus (administrators, faculty, and staff) who are concerned with student learning.
* ''Enough Is Enough: A Student Affairs Perspective on Preparedness and Response to a Campus Shooting'' presents first-hand accounts and experienced counsel from professionals who have lived through a violent incident, and continue to deal with its aftermath. They cover violence, suicide prevention, and mental health promotion in an integrated way, and offer a comprehensive plan to create a campus-wide system for collecting information about students at-risk for self-harm or violence toward others. Editors: Brian O. Hemphill (Northern Illinois University) and Brandi Hephner LaBanc (Northern Illinois University).
* ''Multicultural Student Services on Campus'' constitutes a thorough introduction to the structure, organization, and scope of the services and educational mission for new professionals in multicultural student services (MSS). For senior practitioners it offers insights for re-evaluating their strategies, and inspiration to explore new possibilities. The book discusses the history and philosophy of MSS units; describes their operation; asserts the need for integration and coherence across the multiple facets of their work and how their role is influenced by the character and type of their institutions; and considers the challenges and opportunities ahead. Editor: Dafina Lazarus Stewart (Bowling Green State University).
* ''Making Good On The Promise'' gets to the heart of the experience o student affairs professionals with disabilities, to the curricular changes needed in preparation programs for that profession, to the role and appropriate action needed by allies, and to resources that all can use in the education of self and others. Editors: Jeanne L. Higbee (University of Minnesota-Twin Cities) and Alice A. Mitchell (University of Maryland College Park).
* ''Shifting Paradigms in Student Affairs'' is addressed to all student affairs professionals whose primary focus is student learning. Faculty members in preparation programs, senior administrators and student development educators in residence halls, student unions or career counseling offices will use the ideas presented in different ways. Nevertheless, the book has a common purpose for all readers which is to assert the educational functions of student affairs and services, and to situate student development education solidly within the mission of colleges and universities in the United States. Editor: Jane Fried (Central Connecticut State University).
* ''Empowering Women in Higher Education and Student Affairs'' addresses the experiences and position of women students, from application to college through graduate school, and the barriers they encounter; the continuing inequalities in the rates of promotion and progression of women and other marginalized groups to positions of authority, and the gap in earnings between men and women; and pays particular attention to how race and other social markers impact such disparities, contextualizing them across all institutional types. Editors: Penny A. Pasque (University of Oklahoma), Shelley Errington Nicholson.
* ''The First Generation Student Experience'' are 14 first-person narratives – by first-generation students spanning freshman to graduate years – that help the reader get to grips with the variety of ethnic and economic categories to which they belong. The book concludes by defining 14 key issues that institutions need to address, and offers a course of action for addressing them. By Jeff Davis.
* ''College Student Death: Guidance for a Caring Campus'' is the result of many years of collaboration with more than thirty contributors. This book applies the knowledge of university personnel called upon to respond to student death on and off campus and to provide solace to family and the campus community. It also provides support to university staff in the immediacy of student death, guides the design of policy before a crisis occurs, and provide instructional considerations for faculty. Editors: Rosa Cintrón (University of Central Florida), Erin Taylor Weathers, Katherine Garlough (Oklahoma City Community College).
* ''Where You Work Matters'' offers current and future administrators a greater appreciation for the vibrancy and complexity of the student affairs profession. This volume challenges the widely held assumption that the professional practice of student affairs administration transcends the influence of [[organizational culture]]. Based on data and commentaries from more than 1,100 practitioners, this book describes how the experience of student affairs administrators varies by institutional type. The findings paint a multifaceted and integrated portrait of the profession. Author: Joan B. Hirt (Virginia Polytechnic Institute &amp; State University).
* ''Job One: Experiences of New Professionals in Student Affairs''[http://members.myacpa.org/Scripts/4Disapi.dll/4DCGI/store/ItemDescription.html?Action=Cart_Item_Description&amp;InvID_Web=195&amp;Template=Books%20and%20Periodicals&amp;MarketName_W=&amp;ISBN_W=&amp;Start_W=1&amp;End_W=25&amp;NumToShow=25&amp;Volume_W=&amp;Time=1028557555&amp;SessionID=1942828260mf13my5o7d9o0jv7j56k0qn1b601g3m3nbpu73nfeal3c805z9fg1x] focuses on nine narratives written by new professionals about their introduction and transitions into student affairs. It also includes four chapters co-written by senior student affairs professionals and preparation program faculty who synthesize, integrate, and theoretically interpret the new professionals' narratives. Recommendations included in the final chapter focus on re-conceptualizing graduate preparation programs and professional development events. Edited by Peter Magolda (Miami University-Oxford) and Jill Carnaghi (Washington University in St. Louis).
* ''Toward A Sustainable Future: The Role of Student Affairs in Creating Healthy Environments, Social Justice and Strong Economies'' [http://members.myacpa.org/Scripts/4Disapi.dll/4DCGI/store/ItemDescription.html?Action=Cart_Item_Description&amp;InvID_Web=663&amp;Template=Books%20and%20Periodicals&amp;MarketName_W=&amp;ISBN_W=&amp;Start_W=1&amp;End_W=25&amp;NumToShow=25&amp;Volume_W=&amp;Time=1028557555&amp;SessionID=1942828260mf13my5o7d9o0jv7j56k0qn1b601g3m3nbpu73nfeal3c805z9fg1x] is a call to action for college student educators, articulating the crucial role we play in the international sustainability movement.

*Firm A may compete with B in some markets but not others.
*Firm A competes with B over certain attributes (such as [[reliability engineering|reliability]] and [[design]]) but not over others (price).
*Firm A considers B as a competitor but B does not consider A to be a competitor.
*Firm A does not consider B to be a competitor, however, [[consumers]] see A's products as competing with B's products.

The '''Australian Companies Institute''' ('''Ausbuy''') was, until 2016, a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]], non-political organisation that encouraged [[Australians]] to support Australian-owned and Australian-made products and services. Their goal was to keep the jobs and profits in Australia and for the decisions to be made by Australians.

Due to a downturn in membership renewals and increased costs, the company went into voluntary administration and was [[Australian insolvency law#Liquidation|wound-up]] in 2016.&lt;ref name=rw-2016/&gt; The ownership of the Ausbuy logos, business name and trademarks were transferred to the [[Australian Made logo|Australian Made Campaign Ltd]].&lt;ref name=rw-2016/&gt;

{{toc level|3}}

==Objectives==
Ausbuy's main tasks involved communication at many levels as follows:

* To alert the people of Australia to the long term problems facing Australia and the possible effect on their children and grandchildren.
* Commenting on television and radio about relevant issues.
* Lobbying governments on such issues as labelling laws, foreign takeovers of Australian companies and competition issues.
* Publication of the ''Ausbuy Guide'',  designed to enable the Australian public to identify and support the products and services offered by Australian-owned companies. This book identified brands and was of a size that could be carried round by the principal shopper.
* Use of a [[logo]] which it licensed to its members to enable differentiation of their products and allow the consumer to identify them as being provided by Australian-owned companies.
* Arranging promotions with supermarkets to assist the members to sell their products.
* Publication of a newsletter discussing issues of the day in a non-partisan manner and using terms the general public understands.{{sfnp|Gallagher|2007|p=29}}

==Background==
&lt;small&gt;{{Essay-like|section|date=January 2010}}&lt;/small&gt;
After [[World War II]] Australia faced the problem of having an underdeveloped [[manufacturing]] base, which left it dependent on overseas supplies. There was a realisation that this situation, combined with Australia's geographic isolation, made it vulnerable. This led to the decision being made to build up manufacturing capability. The aftermath of war provided opportunities to recruit skilled workers from [[Europe]] and Australia was able to establish capacity behind the protection of a [[tariff]] wall. It became obvious that this wall had to be reduced but the rate of reduction ran well ahead of Australia's increasing ability to compete in a [[global market]]. 

===Effects of economic reform and tariff reduction===
Australia adopted policies of economic liberalisation and micro-economic reform in the early 1980s, including the privatisation of government corporations, deregulation of [[factor market]]s, floating of the [[Australian dollar]], and the reduction of trade protection.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron Clyde R ''[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lab/86/cameron.html How the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party Lost Its Way] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120803004406/www.historycooperative.org/journals/lab/86/cameron.html |date=2012-08-03 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; Justifications for reducing trade tariffs included the portrayal of Australia as a good global citizen and, at the same time, reducing [[inflationary]] pressures. The costs have been high: Australia's [[foreign debt]] has risen extremely quickly, factories have closed and well-paid skilled jobs in factories have been replaced by unskilled jobs in the [[service industries]].{{sfnp|Gallagher|2007|p=27}}
 
Australia has effectively exported jobs overseas and its [[foreign debt]] exceeds A$600 billion and is growing. Australia simply does not produce more than it uses. The country has been living on borrowed time, and Australians have stopped talking about [[productivity]] and value adding. For example, Australia exports [[raw materials]] and its unique fine wool, but then imports them back at a higher value. [[Free trade agreements]] have been signed by Australia, which further expose what manufacturers it has left, and then Australian governments bolster strategic industries to save jobs.

Australia is recognised as an [[innovative]] and [[productive]] country, and it needs local governments and [[consumer]]s to appreciate and support what is unique to this country. The international trend of [[globalization|globalisation]] has been matched domestically with the rise of the mega store concept of retailing. Large [[supermarket]]s as well as warehouses have their selling policies based on ''anytime, everywhere, everything the same'', which means their procurement policies are centrally driven; they demand bulk orders from specific price competitive producers and farmers nor do these retail giants acknowledge local peculiarities and set a priority on ''Made in Australia''.{{sfnp|Fischer|2004|pp=111–113}}

===Buy Australian campaigns===
In its magazine ''Choice'' of January 1987 the Australian Consumers' Association advised [[consumers]] to ''Buy Australian'' when the quality was equal and the price comparable to imported products. Nevertheless, it is notable given that ''Choice'' is well regarded as an impartial source of information for Australian consumers, but the Australian Consumers' Association refused to make a commitment to favour an Australian product over a better product from overseas.{{sfnp|Australian Consumer's Association|1987|pp=32–33}} 

This could be classified as a typical means of [[moral suasion]], which can be seen as benevolent compulsion, or making others conform without enforcing rules directly. It is also termed simply ''suasion'' (in Japan it is known as ''window guidance'') which has been used to persuade consumers and institutions to keep to official guidelines. The ''moral aspect'' stems from pressing on the targets of the suasion their ''moral responsibility'' to operate in a way that is consistent with furthering the national good. In the United States it is known as [[jawboning]] - it means exercising the persuasive power of talk rather than legislation.{{sfnp|Fischer|2007|p=21}} 

In countries experiencing economic decline, especially those with a high [[unemployment]] level and [[trade deficit]], consumers are urged to buy locally made products to help create jobs, assist in defeating unemployment and to avoid import penetration. Sometimes it is a so-called ''war against unemployment'' where policy makers like to raise an appeal to [[patriotic]] behaviour, shifting the responsibility of employment and the level of high import penetration towards consumers.{{sfnp|Fischer|2007|pp=22–23}} Ultimately a successful moral suasion campaign which reduces import penetration significantly can be seen as a tax on imports with the potential to increase unemployment in the import sector as a result of decreasing demand for imports.

The lower supply of the [[Australian dollar]] may cause it to be of higher value in the foreign exchange markets, which obviously leads to a tax on exports, or consequently employment of Australians by Australian manufacturers producing goods for overseas markets will reduce.{{sfnp|Black|1995|p=8}} Furthermore, given that consumers are shifting their demand for consumer goods to domestic products, it still remains a dilemma whether the retailers and manufacturers of domestic products invest in Australian business operations. Or in other words, which authority controls that the profits remain in Australia?

==History of Ausbuy==
Ausbuy was founded in 1991 by Harry Wallace as a result of his family business of 120 years being lost to foreign [[import]]s deposited in Australia to gain market share. His company was only one example of this, as an increasing number of companies in Australia had been forced to sell out to foreign interests, and foreign governments subsidised their producers to sell cheaply into the Australian market in [[competition]] with Australian-owned companies who do not enjoy that level of government support.{{sfnp|Gallagher|2007|p=25}}

By 2007, Ausbuy had approximately 100 members, producing more than 3000 products across 150 categories. During the 2009 Truth in Labelling Senate Inquiry, Ausbuy was the only large representative organisation that   asked for Country of Origin to be required on labelling used by food producers, manufacturers and distributors.

Ausbuy presented a petition of over 55,000 signatures to the Federal Government in November 2012 asking for a moratorium on the sale of Australian land and wealth-creating assets until the establishment a national interest test.

On 26 May 2016, the Board of Directors decided to undertake voluntary winding up of the company.&lt;ref name=rw-2016/&gt; As a result of a number of factors including changes to country of origin labeling, downturn in membership renewals, increased one off costs associated with company structure, compliance and technology, Ausbuy was no longer able to continue as a going concern.&lt;ref name=rw-2016/&gt; Despite a wide range of activities and strategies designed to retain and grow membership over the previous 18 months, the organisation had continued its decline to a point where a voluntary winding up of the company was the only prudent option.

With around 4,800 exhibitors, '''Automechanika''' is the world’s biggest [[trade fair]] for the automobile [[aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]]. It is held every two years (in even years) in alternation with the [[International Motor Show Germany]] (Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung – IAA Pkw) at the [[Messe Frankfurt]]. In distinction to the [[Motor show|Motor Show]], Automechanika is open to trading visitors only.

== History ==
On 20 January 1971, the organizer of the [[International Motor Show Germany|Frankfurt Motor Show]], the [[Verband der Automobilindustrie|Association of the German Automobile Industry (Verband der Deutschen Automobilindustrie – VDA)]] canceled the show scheduled to be held the following September. According to the President of the Association, Dr. Johann Heinrich von Brunn, this was because the automobile industry needed to take cost-saving measures to counteract the high costs facing it. The cost of the exhibition – almost DM 100 million – was considered to be excessive in comparison to the business benefits. For the Frankfurt-based fair and exhibition company, Messe Frankfurt, cancellation would have meant a loss of at least DM 1.5 to 2 million in revenues. 
In mid-March 1971, Messe Frankfurt announced that a new event – Automechanika 71 – would be held instead of the Motor Show. The initiative for this came from the associations of the motor-vehicle and filling station and garage trades that still wanted to present their products. Manufacturers of automotive parts account for around 90 percent of exhibitors at the Frankfurt Motor Show.

The first Automechanika was held from 18 to 26 September 1971 and attracted around 400 exhibitors and 75,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.expodatabase.com/tradeshow/automechanika-frankfurt-the-worlds-leading-trade-fair-for-the-automotive-service-industry-591.html&lt;/ref&gt; The fair was repeated in 1972 and held thereafter every two years in alternation with the Frankfurt Motor Show.

'''Camille Cavallier''' (19 May 1854 – 10 June 1926) was a French industrialist who directed the [[Pont-à-Mousson]] iron works in [[Lorraine]] in the first quarter of the 20th century, specializing in making cast iron pipes. 
He came from a poor family but obtained a good technical education and joined the iron maker as an employee in 1874. 
He rose rapidly through the ranks, and started to acquire shares.
Soon after taking charge of the company he became the largest shareholder.
He quadrupled production in the years leading up to [[World War I]] (1914–18).
The company was devastated by the war, but Cavallier managed to bring production back up to prewar levels before his death.

==Early years==
{{Location map|France|caption=Location of Pont-à-Mousson|width=220 |position=left |lat_deg=48.9053 |lon_deg=6.0547|relief=y}}

Camille Constant Cavallier was born on 19 May 1854 in [[Pont-à-Mousson]], then in the [[Meurthe (department)|Meurthe department]].
His parents were Jean Pierre Baptiste Cavallier (b. 1816) and Marguerite Sophie Martin (b. 1825).{{sfn|Garric}}
His father was a gamekeeper for the Eaux et Forêts and his mother was a cleaning lady whose customers included Xavier Rogé, head of the local Société de Pont-à-Mousson iron works.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}
His sister Sophie later joined the [[Sœurs de la Charité de Saint Charles]], and his brother Henri became a member of the board of directors of the Société de Pont-à-Mousson.
For many years the family lived in the heart of the Bois-le-Prêtre, a forest about {{convert|5|km}} from the center of the town.
In October 1867 Camille was admitted as a day student to the Collège of Pont-à-Mousson, where he was an excellent student.
In 1870 he was accepted by the [[École Nationale des Arts et Métiers]] in [[Châlons-sur-Marne]].
His education was interrupted by the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870.
He returned to the college for a few months after it reopened in the spring of 1871, then entered the École des Arts et Métiers in Châlons-sur-Marne on 15 October 1871.
He graduated on 31 July 1874 as a medalist.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}

[[File:Marbache.jpg|thumb| [[Marbache]] ]]
The Pont-à-Mousson company had been created in 1856 by a group of Lorraine businessmen to operate the [[Marbache]] iron mine and to use the ore to manufacture cast iron.
Xavier Rogé was the manager. In 1862 the enterprise was liquidated due to lack of sufficient capital to cover the high investment expenses.
Rogé managed to raise capital in the [[Saarland]] and restart the business, selling most of its production to forges in the Ardennes and Champagne.
In 1866 Rogé visited England and became aware of the new and promising market for cast-iron water pipes.
He focused the company on pipe production, and found a ready market when cities began to make large investment in water supply after 1871.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}
He adopted the English method of casting pipes in vertical rather than horizontal moulds.{{sfn|Vuillemin|2002}}

Camille Cavallier joined the Société de Pont-à-Mousson on 1 August 1874.
At this time the company consisted only of the factory at Pont-à-Mousson and the Marbache Iron Mine in the Nancy Basin.
The blast furnaces produced only 50,000 tons per year, of which only 12,000 tons were made into moulded products, mainly cast iron pipes.
Cavallier worked at the company for four months before being called up on 5 November 1874 for a year of military service, which he spent at Versailles in the 1st Regiment of Engineers.
He was discharged as a second lieutenant of the reserve on 1 November 1875.
He returned to the Société de Pont-à-Mousson on 2 November 1875, where he would work for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}

==Growing responsibility (1875–99)==

Camille Cavallier was first assigned to the "flat" foundry, then in 1876 to the "standing" foundry dedicated to making iron gutters and pipes.
In 1877 Rogé gave him charge of the newly created commercial service.
The job was to establish regional agencies, monitor demand, watch competitors and draw up quotations for tenders.
He achieved excellent results in selling the cast iron pipes, and in 1883 won the tenders for the city of Paris.
Rogé decided to groom Cavallier as his successor, and in the 1880s Cavallier became in effect the director-general, although Rogé retained that title.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}
Cavallier did not limit himself to the commercial side, but played a large role in building up the company's mining assets.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}
The company depended on the Marbache and [[Custines]] mines in the Nancy Basin, which delivered about 100,000 tons of ore annually.
After surveys of the [[Millery, Meurthe-et-Moselle|Millery]] region the company asked for a mining concession there, but was refused.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}

[[File:Societe Anonyme des Hauts Fourneaux de Pont-a-Mousson c. 1905.jpg|thumb|Factory at Pont-à-Mousson]]
Xavier Rogé began to investigate land around [[Auboué]] near the part of Lorraine that had been annexed by Germany, and on 1 December 1882 found the upper layers of the iron oxide formation of the Briey Basin.
The survey then stopped, since the company undertaking it declared that the iron oxide formation had been completely crossed.
Cavallier thought there could be lower layers, and obtained permission to continue the survey.
In April 1883 a layer {{convert|4|m}} thick was found, and on 11 August 1884 the Société de Pont-à-Mousson was granted the concession.
The technicians said that it would be very difficult to pass through the [[overburden]] above the Auboué ore deposit due to the amount of water it contained.
Cavallier decided to proceed anyway, using the freezing method to pass through the {{convert|100|m}} aquifer layer, although this method had not been used for more than {{convert|60|m}} in the past. The gamble succeeded.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}

The Pont-à-Mousson ironworks was transformed into a ''[[societe anonyme]]'' in 1886, with Xavier Rogé as its sole administrator.{{sfn|Joly|2008|p=30}}
Rogé fell seriously ill in 1888 and depended more and more on Cavallier, then aged 34.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}
On 17 August 1888 the company was granted the Vieux-Château concession, and on 25 May 1892 was granted the [[Belleville, Meurthe-et-Moselle|Belleville]] concession, both in the Nancy Basin.
The company acquired the [[Malzéville]] and Grande Goutte mines in the Nancy Basin.
In the 1890s the blast furnaces were fitted with [[Edward Alfred Cowper|Cowper]] [[regenerative heat exchanger]]s.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}
Until 1889 Cavallier had no shares in the company.
In 1890 he acquired 100 shares, and in 1898 another 136.{{sfn|Joly|2008|p=115}}
When Rogé was sick Cavallier acted as the effective head of the company, and on 15 January 1895 he was named deputy director.{{sfn|Joly|2008|p=115}}{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}

About 1878 Camille Cavallier married Thérèse Julie Mangeot ({{circa|1855–1933}}).
Their children were Charles (1879–1930) and Jeanne Marguerite Françoise (b. {{circa|1882}}).
Around 1908 his daughter married Marcel Paul (1879–1946).{{sfn|Garric}}
[[File:Camille Cavallier meeting union leaders in 1908.jpg|thumb|Camille Cavallier meeting union leaders in 1908]]

==Chief executive: Pre-war period (1899–1914)==

On 31 January 1899 Camille Cavallier was made joint administrator, and became sole administrator when Rogé retired the next year.{{sfn|Joly|2008|p=30}}
On 31 March 1899 Cavallier obtained the [[Mairy]] concession in the Briey Basin for the company.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}
Since becoming head of the company Cavallier devoted a large part of his salary to buying shares in the company.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}
In 1900, Cavallier held only 8% of the capital of Pont-à-Mousson, with 236 shares.
By the time of the meeting of 9 January 1901 he had become the largest shareholder with 816 shares, or 28%, due to acquisition of the shares of Xavier Rogé.{{sfn|Joly|2008|p=115}}
By 1912 he controlled 36.8%, including the shares of his family members.{{sfn|Joly|2008|p=115}}
By 1910 Cavallier was worth 10 million gold francs, a large but not huge amount.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}
After World War I he controlled 43% of the company's capital.
His motivation seems to have been primarily to build up the enterprise through hard work rather than to make a personal fortune.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}

Cavallier built his house beside the factory on the [[Nancy, France|Nancy]]–[[Metz]] road so that he could be "in the middle of his hive."{{sfn|Vuillemin|2002}}
He would work long hours, from 6 in the morning until late at night.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}
A general strike started at Pont-à-Mousson in September 1905, the first, triggered by dismissal of the union's treasurer but caused by long-running grievances over pay.
The strike was a shock to the management.
Cavallier founded the Fête du travail (Labour Festival) in 1906 in an attempt to reunite the community.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier s’entretient ... 1908}}
In 1910 the steelmaker [[François de Wendel]] ran for election as deputy in [[Briey]], opposed by a local physician who was supported by the Fédération républicaine. 
He lost by 3,506 votes to the doctor's 3,820.
Wendel was convinced, perhaps correctly, that Cavallier had engineered his defeat since he distrusted Wendel's dealings with union leaders and thought he had encouraged the strike .{{sfn|Gordon|1996|p=162}}
Unlike self-made men such as Cavallier and Alexandre Dreux of the [[Aciéries de Longwy]], Wendel was aristocratic, which did not endear him with the other industrialists.{{sfn|Gordon|1996|p=156}}

[[File:Sondage 01.jpg|thumb|Exploratory drilling shaft for coal built in 1905 by the Société Joseph Vogt for the Société des Fonderies de Pont-à-Mousson]]
Cavallier transformed the moderately sized cast iron pipe manufacturer into a giant, always concentrating on making pipes.
Annual cast iron production rose from 80,000 to 183,000 tons between 1900 and 1913.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}
Cavallier studied use of blast furnace gas for production of electrical power, built a test station, then built a large central power station.
He continued to increase the percent of pipes in the company output.
In 1903 he installed blast furnaces at Auboué.
In 1905 he built a foundry at [[Foug]], throwing up the building and furnaces in a month.
In 1905 Cavallier purchased the [[Moineville]] concession, which was later merged with the Auboué concession.
The company acquired control of the Bayard foundries in Haute-Marne.
It also took stakes in the Micheville and [[ Compagnie des forges et aciéries de la marine et d'Homécourt|Marine-Homécourt]] steel makers, and after the war would take interests in steelworks in Lorraine and the Saar.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}

At the 23 January 1900 meeting Cavallier pointed out the importance of securing a supply of coke, and proposed to acquire a concession to open a new coal mine.
In January 1902 Cavallier began to discuss a joint operation with the Société de Micheville and the Société du Nord et de l'Est to exploit coal deposits in northern Belgium, leading to incorporation of the Société Campinoise on 11 April 1902.
The Beeringen-Coursel concession was granted to a group of three exploration companies on 26 November 1906, and Pont-à-Mousson participated in creation of the Société des Charbonnages de Beeringen ([[Beringen, Belgium|Beringen]] Coal Company) on 23 February 1907.
The Beringen deposit was rich, but covered by a layer {{convert|550-700|m}} thick of sands containing aquifers. It was not until after [[World War I]] (1914–18) that the first pit was opened on 26 December 1921.
In Lorraine Cavallier explored for a continuation of the [[Saarbrücken]] coalfield.
A test drill of {{convert|1500|m}} near the central station of the Pont-à-Mousson plant found several layers of coal, but only at great depth.
The company took an interest in coal mines in several other parts of northern France.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}

==World War I (1914–18)==
[[File:Pont-à-Mousson - France - 3 Nov 1918.jpg|thumb|Pont-à-Mousson on 3 November 1918]]
At the start of [[World War I]] the Pont-à-Mousson factory was occupied by the Germans for a few days, and remained less than {{convert|3|km}} from the front line.
Auboué was occupied.
The Foug factory remained in operation, and was converted to manufacture of munitions.
Workshops were established at Belleville in 1916 and [[Sens]] in 1917.
In 1917 Cavallier founded the Fonderie Lorraine to manufacture war materials in [[Saint-Étienne-du-Rouvray]], near Rouen.
His son in law, Marcel Paul, was given responsibility for the plant, which was built on {{convert|50|ha}} between the railway and the river.{{sfn|Vuillemin|2002}}
By the end of the war 20% of French shells were being made from cast iron in the Foug foundry.{{sfn|Vuillemin|2002}}

At the 24 January 1917 general meeting Cavallier proposed to appoint a board of directors with representatives of capital and labour.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}
Cavallier became deputy chairman in 1917, and three administrators were named.
Marcel Paul was titled ''administrateur délégué'' and the other two were titled ''administrateur directeur général''.{{sfn|Joly|2008|p=38}}
Towards the end of the war study groups under [[Humbert de Wendel]] defined the demands of the Comite des Forges for the post-war settlement.
They wanted return of Alsace-Lorraine, cession of the Saar and transfer of Luxembourg from the German Customs Union to a union with Belgium.
Camille Cavallier was one of a small number of iron masters who also wanted the left bank of the Rhine.{{sfn|Maier|2015|p=71}}

==Post-war period (1918–26)==

In the post-war period the company faced a massive task of reconstruction, while training new workers to replace those lost in the war.
In 1919–20 Pont-à-Mousson took over a major pipe-making facility in the [[Saarland|Saar]].
The company also acquired interests in Lorraine companies that had been liquidated, notably Rombas, and acquired interests in coal mines in the Saar and [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]].{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}
President [[Raymond Poincaré]] lit the first reconstructed blast furnace at Pont-à-Mousson 23 November 1919 in a solemn ceremony.{{sfn|Vuillemin|2002}}
Within France, Cavallier was in favor of quota agreements between competing companies to prevent destructive price wars.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}
German demand for iron from Lorraine plummeted after [[World War I]] (1914–18).
By 1922 total demand was just a tenth of the pre-war demand from the Ruhr alone.
Contributing factors were the growing use of the Siemens-Martin process of [[open hearth furnace]]s for recycling scrap steel combined with availability of war material to be recycled. 
In early 1922 [[Robert Pinot]] of the [[Comité des forges]] explained to Camille Cavallier that this had "permitted a boycotting of our ''[[Minette (ore)|minette]]'' ore these past years."{{sfn|Maier|2015|p=199}}
However, Pont-à-Mousson gradually regained its export markets.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}

[[File:Haut-fourneau Pont-à-Mousson.jpg|thumb|Blast furnace at Pont-à-Mousson (2008)]]
On 7 May 1924 Cavallier said the company was self-sufficient in iron ore, and would soon be self-sufficient in coke.
It was not until 1925 that Cavallier was able to announce that production had returned to prewar levels.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}
When Cavallier died in 1926 annual production had reached 237,000 tons.
His strategy as a pipe specialist led him to move into the export market early on so the company would not depend on fluctuating domestic demand.
By the time he died half of the company's output was exported, with 450 foreign cities using Pont-à-Mousson pipes, 127 of them outside of Europe.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}
Cavallier knew that exports forced industry to become more competitive and efficient, and reduced costs helped domestic customers.{{sfn|Gordon|1996|p=27}}

Cavallier became Vice-President of the Nancy Chamber of Commerce and a member of many committees and associations.
He died of a heart attack on 10 June 1926 at his property of Gentilly, at [[Maxéville]], near Nancy, the day after presiding over a general shareholders meeting.{{sfn|Camille Cavallier (1854–1926) – Annales}}
At the time of his death he was a member of the board of the [[Comité des Forges de France]], director of about twenty companies, and had received many honors and official commissions.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}
Cavallier had chosen his son-in-law, Marcel Paul, as his successor.
The heirs of Xavier Rogé and two other shareholders, Colonel Plassiart and the Lorraine banker Paul Lenglet, still had sizeable shareholdings.
In the early 1920s Cavallier arranged for them to form a pact within a financial company, Filor (Financière Lorraine).
This lasted until 1964, when the founding families still controlled 50% of the capital of Pont-à-Mousson.{{sfn|Gaston-Breton|2005}}

{{Capitalism}}
[[Proto-capitalism|Proto-capitalist]] [[economy|economies]] and [[free market]]s became active during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] where an early [[market economy]] and a form of [[merchant capitalism]] took root{{where?|date=July 2015}} between the 8th–12th centuries.

A vigorous [[monetary economy]] developed, based on a widely circulated [[currency]] (the [[dinar]]) and on the integration of previously independent [[monetary]] areas.

[[Business]] techniques and forms of [[Company|business organisation]] employed during this time included:

*[[contract]]s
*[[bills of exchange]]

[[Organization]]al [[Business|enterprises]] independent from the [[State (polity)|state]] also existed in the medieval Islamic world, while the [[Agency (law)|agency]] institution was also introduced{{by whom|date=July 2015}}.&lt;ref&gt;Said Amir Arjomand (1999), "The Law, Agency, and Policy in Medieval Islamic Society: Development of the Institutions of Learning from the Tenth to the Fifteenth Century", ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'' '''41''', pp. 263–93.

[[File:Secy of State Hillary Clinton Swearing In.jpg|thumb|Four members of the family in January 2009. From left to right, Hillary Clinton, [[Bill Clinton]], Chelsea Clinton, Dorothy Rodham, and the unrelated Vice President [[Joe Biden]].]]

The '''Clinton family''' is a prominent American [[political family]] related to [[Bill Clinton]], the 42nd [[President of the United States]] (1993–2001), and his wife [[Hillary Clinton]], the 67th [[United States Secretary of State]] (2009–13), Senator from New York (2001–09) and the [[First Lady of the United States]] (1993–2001). Their immediate family was the First Family of the United States from 1993 to 2001. In [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016]], Hillary Clinton became the first female presidential nominee from a major political party in United States history. The Clintons (Bill and Hillary) are the first married couple to each be nominated for president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2016/07/26/hillary-clinton-makes-history-by-claiming-democratic-presidential-nomination/|title=Hillary Clinton Makes History By Claiming Democratic Presidential Nomination|work=cbslocal.com|accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was defeated in the election by television personality and businessman [[Donald Trump]].

==Parentage==

===Paternal family===
Bill Clinton's father, [[William Jefferson Blythe Jr.]] (February 27, 1918 – May 17, 1946), was a traveling heavy equipment salesman who died in a car crash three months before Bill was born.&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of William J.

Santa Clarita, Cal.: Boyer, 1995."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=About the Ulster-Scots|url=http://www.ulsterscotssociety.com/about_the-roots.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ulster-Scots and the United States Presidents|publisher=[[Ulster-Scots Agency]]|url=https://www.ulsterscotsagency.com/fs/doc/new_range_of_ulster-scots_booklets/US_and_USA_Presidents_BK3_AW_6.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blythe was married four times. He married for the first time in December 1935, and the bride was Virginia Adele Gash; they were divorced only thirteen months later. Although no child was born to the couple during their marriage, they later had a son together. After the divorce, Virginia moved to [[California]] and married first a man named Coffelt, then a man named Charles Ritzenthaler. However, she and Blythe remained friends, and she visited him on occasion. A son was conceived during these visits, and Henry Leon Blythe was born in [[Sherman, Texas]], on June 17, 1938, some eighteen months after his parents had been divorced. Henry's parents lost touch with each other when he was an infant, after his father briefly married and divorced his mother's sister, and he never knew his biological father or paternal siblings. Later in life, Henry Leon Blythe took the name "Henry Leon Ritzenthaler" in honor of a step-father. He ran several small businesses in [[Paradise, California]], including a janitorial business, and died in 2009. He was unaware of his connection to the future president until the presidential campaign of 1992, when a ''[[Washington Post]]'' investigation, based on birth registry records, revealed details of Bill Clinton's family. Ritzenthaler met his half-brother for the first time around that time, and the physical resemblance between them was remarked upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/22/us/clinton-s-lost-half-brother-to-neighbors-he-s-just-leon.html|title=Clinton's Lost Half-Brother? To Neighbors, He's Just Leon|date=June 22, 1993|work=The New York Times|accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Blythe's second marriage happened in December 1940 when, nearly four years after his divorce from Virginia Adele Gash, Blythe married her sister, Minnie Faye Gash. This marriage was annulled only four months later, in April 1941, and there were no children. Barely days after the annulment, in May 3, 1941, Blythe married again. His third wife was Wanetta Ellen Alexander of [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. Wanetta gave birth to Blythe's daughter on May 11, 1941, exactly eight days after their wedding. She had become pregnant with Blythe's child even before he had married Minnie Faye Gash in December 1940. The daughter thus born to Wanetta and Blythe is Sharon Lee Blythe Pettijohn, who is still alive in 2016. Blythe and Wanetta were formally divorced three years later, in April 1944. They lost touch immediately afterwards; Wanetta, who eventually settled in [[Tucson, Arizona]], had no inkling of Blythe's subsequent history until the presidential campaign of 1992 and the Washington Post story. Upon seeing old photographs of Bill Clinton's father flashed on TV, Wanetta "swears on a stack of Bibles ...... that that was the man she was married to" said her son-in-law Bob Pettijohn, Sharon Lee Blythe Pettijohn's husband.

Blythe's divorce from Wanetta Alexander was granted by court in April 1944. Seven months before that, in September 1943, Blythe had already "married" [[Virginia Dell Cassidy]] of [[Bodcaw, Arkansas]]. Blythe and Cassidy remained married until his death in May 1946, which happened in a car crash. On August 19, 1946, three months after Blythe's death, Cassidy gave birth to their only child, the future Bill Clinton. Cassidy had no knowledge of Blythe's previous marriages until decades later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5DB1F3FF932A15755C0A965958260|publisher=New York Times|date=June 21, 1993|first=Edmund|last=Andrews|title= Clinton Reported to Have A Brother He Never Met}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maternal family===
Bill Clinton's mother, [[Virginia Dell Cassidy]] (later Virginia Dell Blythe Clinton Dwire Kelley), was born in Bodcaw, Arkansas on June 6, 1923. She was the only child of James Eldridge Cassidy (1898–1957), a grocer, by his wife Edith Grisham Cassidy (1901–1968), a nurse anesthetist. Bill Clinton's father, William J. Blythe, was her first husband, and she married him in September 1943, when she was 20 and he was 33 years old. On the day of their wedding, Blythe was still legally married to his third wife Wanetta; his divorce from her was finalized only in April the following year. However, Cassidy may not have known of this circumstance at that time, and certainly did not know of Blythe's first two marriages until decades after his death. After Blythe died, she moved back with her parents, gave birth to a son three months later, and named him William Jefferson Blythe III in honor of his paternal grandfather. This was the future [[Bill Clinton]].

In 1950, four years after Blythe's death, the young widow married car salesman [[Roger Clinton Sr.]] (July 23, 1908 – November 8, 1967). Roger was born in [[Yell County, Arkansas]], in July 1908 to Allen W. Clinton (August 26, 1880 – June 14, 1965) and Eula Cornwell Clinton (May 29, 1882 – October 10, 1975).&lt;ref&gt;US Census, 1910, Yell County, Arkansas.&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage produced one child, the actor and musician [[Roger Clinton Jr.]], who was born in 1956 and is the only one of Bill Clinton's siblings to have been raised with him and have a close relationship with him. In 1962, Roger and Virginia Clinton suffered a crisis in their marriage; they got divorced and then remarried in quick succession within that year. At this time, the 16-year-old William Jefferson Blythe III officially adopted his step-father's surname as his own and took the name William Jefferson Clinton. Roger Clinton died in 1967 after seventeen years of marriage.

In January 3, 1969, only one year after Roger Clinton's death, his widow married for the third time. Her groom, [[Jeff Dwire]] (June 6, 1923 – August 1974), was the same age as she, and had three daughters by a previous marriage. After briefly serving in the military, he had worked as a carpenter, a hairdresser, a [[judo]] teacher and a football coach, and had run a string of small businesses, including building houses, dealing in oil-well equipment and selling financial securities. What alarmed Virginia's family and friends was the fact that he had served nine months in prison during 1962 for stock fraud. However, Bill Clinton was supportive of the new man in his mother's life; he served as Best Man and also played and sang at the wedding reception. The marriage, which produced no children, lasted until Dwire died in August 1974 from complications arising from [[diabetes]].

In January 1982, Virginia Dwire married for the fourth and last time to Richard Kelley. This marriage, which produced no children, lasted until Virginia's death from breast cancer on January 6, 1994. In later life, Virginia was insistent that all official documents refer to her by her full and chosen name, "Virginia Dell Blythe Clinton Dwire Kelley."

==Family of Chelsea Clinton==
Bill and Hillary Clinton's daughter [[Chelsea Clinton|Chelsea Victoria Clinton]] was born on February 27, 1980, in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], [[Pulaski County, Arkansas]], while her father was [[Governor of Arkansas]].

==Restrictive Trade Practices Commission==
The tribunal was first known under its former name, the Restrictive Trade Practices Commission.

'''David McHattie Forbes''' (21 July 1863 – 23 March 1937) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[botanist]], ethnologist, [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]] manager and explorer on the island of Hawai'i. He practised forestry, agronomy, and horticulture and served as the first district forester of South Kohala in 1905, and twenty years later was appointed a judge in Waimea.

In 1905, he was the discoverer, with two colleagues, of the greatest collection of [[Polynesia]]n artefacts ever found. The location of the find became known as the Forbes Cave and his family preserved his third of the found objects for half a century until they donated them to the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Volcanoes National Park]] in 1956. The Forbes Collection was on public view for 34 years until 1990, when the [[NAGPRA]] legislation was passed and each item was evaluated. They were found to be priceless [[cultural artifacts|cultural artefacts]] but also to be subject to repatriation and they were removed permanently from public viewing. The other two-thirds of the found objects were sold to the [[Bishop Museum]] by Forbes' two expedition partners: Wilhelm Wagener and Friedrich Haehnisch.&lt;ref&gt;"Paradise Almost Lost". Christopher Pala. In: Museum – March/April Issue 2008 | http://www.aam-us.org/pubs/mn/nagpra.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Born in [[Scotland]], the son of Alexander and Mary (McHattie) Forbes, he was educated in the local schools.

==Career==
He began working in the private estate nurseries of [[Morayshire|Moray, Scotland]] in 1879 and later in the forests of the same estate. In 1882, he worked in the nurseries of Dixon &amp; Co., [[Edinburgh]]. In 1883 he became the Foreman Forester for the estate of Fletcher's [[Saltoun Hall]], the seat of the oldest and largest private library in Scotland.

In 1887, at the behest of [[William H. Purvis]], he travelled to [[Kukuihaele]] near [[Waipio Valley]], Hawaii, via Cape Horn, to manage an experiment in cinchona cultivation above the sugar line. Purvis, who had already introduced the macadamia nut from Australia, recognised the potential benefits to finding a species of tree that would thrive in the land above the sugarcane, and the bark of the cinchona he imported from Ceylon had a promising yield ratio between bark and quinine. When Purvis' plantation was transferred to the Pacific Sugar Mill Company, in which [[Samuel Parker (Hawaii)|Samuel Parker]] invested in 1879, D. M. Forbes succeeded C. Von Mengersen as manager, running the Pacific Sugar Mill from 1893 to 1907.&lt;ref name="pacific"&gt;{{cite web |title= Pacific Sugar Mill History |url= http://www2.hawaii.edu/~speccoll/p_pacific.html |work= Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association Plantation Archives |publisher= [[University of Hawaii]] |accessdate= 25 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forbes returned to Scotland in 1910 but did not remain. By 1912, he was back in Hawaii, in [[Waiakea, Hawaii|Waiakea]], in [[Hilo]], where he took the position of manager of the Waiakea Mill Company of [[Hilo]]. Finally, he settled in [[Waimea, Hawaii County, Hawaii|Waimea]]. In 1929, he was appointed to the rank of District Magistrate, [[Kohala, Hawaii|South Kohala]],&lt;ref&gt;"Annual Report of the Governor of Hawaii to the Secretary of the Interior for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1929"&lt;/ref&gt; and was reappointed in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;"Annual Report of the Governor of Hawaii to the Secretary of the Interior for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1932"&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the founder of [[Scouting in Hawaii|Scouting]] in Waimea.&lt;ref&gt;''Catherine Lougher: a biography'', page 2, written by Thomas H. Lougher&lt;/ref&gt; He died, in Hilo, in 1937.

==Family==
He married Catherine Lougher at [[Waiakea, Hawaii|Waiakea]], [[Hilo]], on 7 August 1895. They had five children, Blodwyn, Merlyn, Allister, Dyfrig and Elizabeth.

==Legacy==
[[Kukuihaele]] is the site of the original Hawaiian Island stand of [[cinchona]] trees, from which [[quinine]] is made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city-data.com/city/Kukuihaele-Hawaii.html Hawaii City Data]&lt;/ref&gt; They were planted by David McHattie Forbes in 1887 on the forest lands of the [[Pacific Sugar Mill Company]], one patch of approximately {{convert|3|acre|ha}} extent at an elevation of {{convert|2000|ft|m}}, the other patch of 10 to {{convert|12|acre|ha}} is at {{convert|2200|ft|m}} elevation. Despite the best available location, ample drainage and good soil, the [[Cinchona]] trees did not grow as healthy as most exotic plants introduced from a warm climate. Their value became so low compared to the price of labour that the attempt was abandoned in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;''Een en ander over kina en overzicht der cultuur van kina''. By Pieter van der Wielen (Amsterdam: 1905), pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

A Banyan Tree still stands in David McHattie Forbes honour at [[Banyan Drive]] in Hilo, Hawaii, known as the "Hilo Walk of Fame." Next to Forbes, visitors will find such names as [[Amelia Earhart]], [[Babe Ruth]], and [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] on plaques affixed to the trees.

Forbes originated the "Waimea Vegetable and Flower Show" which developed under his leadership into the principal annual horticultural show in West Hawaii.

Forbes planted some camphorwood seedlings in the grounds of the manager's house of the Pacific Sugar Mill Company in the 1880s. Half a century later he used the fragrant wood of these same trees to carve the altar for the [[Imiola Church]] in Waimea. Carving of the altar was completed after his death by his son David Merlyn Lougher Forbes.

He introduced the Jack Fruit tree to Hawaii.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3129">The '''dignity of labour''' is the philosophy that all types of [[Job (role)|jobs]] are respected equally, and no occupation is considered superior and none of the jobs should be discriminated on any basis . Though one's occupation for his or her livelihood involves physical work or mental labour, it is held that the job carries dignity compared to the jobs that involve more intellect than body. Social reformers such as [[Basava]] and his contemporary Sharanas, as well as [[Mahatma Gandhi]], were prominent advocates of the dignity of labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Suryanarayanan |first=A.

The '''Doctor of Public Administration''' ('''D.P.A.''') is a terminal applied-research doctoral degree in the field of [[public administration]] (government), which is a sub-discipline of [[political science]]. The D.P.A. requires significant coursework beyond the masters level and a [[dissertation]] that contributes to theory or practice. Upon successful completion, the title of "Doctor" is awarded and the post-nominal letters of D.P.A. or DPA can be used.

==Overview==
Like a Ph.D., a D.P.A. is normally a terminal research degree. The [[U.S. Department of Education]] and the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) recognize the D.P.A. as an academically equivalent degree to the more common Ph.D. and they do not discriminate between the two degrees.

In many cases, D.P.A. programs are identical to Ph.D. programs. Additionally, the D.P.A. dissertation is usually at the same level as a Ph.D. in terms of effort, rigor, contribution to knowledge, supervision and assessment. A study published by the [[National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration]] titled ''What's in a Name? Comparing DPA and Ph.D. Programs'' concluded that there was "few differences between the programs, noting that degree title is more informative about the type of students recruited than outputs"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

D.P.A. research is both theoretical and practical, but the research focus of the typical D.P.A. addresses applied issues, with the results providing professional outcomes that are of direct relevance to practice. While also intended to prepare graduates for academic careers, the D.P.A., by virtue of its focus on application of theory, has more practical application in managerial settings than the Ph.D. degree. Most D.P.A. graduates lead careers as senior-level practitioners, while others enter academia. This is similar to other professional research doctorates such as the Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) and Doctor of Education (Ed.D).

A Ph.D. is more concentrated on developing theory and conducting specialized scholarly research.  This degree is more appropriate for people who wish to become professional researchers, or who wish to pursue a career in academia. Most Ph.D. graduates lead careers as university researchers and professors or as senior researchers in business or government.

== Purpose ==
The Doctor of Public Administration program is designed to provide senior-level public managers, or quasi-public managers, with the substantive skills, knowledge and values necessary in this area. Students in most programs develop a thorough knowledge of the legal, ethical and political environments of public administrators. Students understand the administrative functions of governmental agencies and gain expertise in strategic planning, advanced management techniques, program implementation and results-based leadership.

The official policy of [[Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration]] (NASPAA) is that the doctorate is a research degree, regardless of degree title. Its "Policy on Doctoral Education in Public Affairs/Public Administration" (1983,1987,1) states that: "Doctoral programs in public administration...should prepare students to undertake significant research in their subsequent careers, whether in government, academic life, or other settings; the capacity to do significant research, rather than access to a particular career setting, is the appropriate goal of doctoral training."

== Structure of programs ==
Most D.P.A. programs require about 90 credit hours of combined graduate coursework. Students are expected to take a number of core classes, electives, research/method classes, and dissertation credits. Some programs also require comprehensive examinations. All programs require a doctoral dissertation that contributes to knowledge. Candidates typically work with a committee and advisors throughout the process and the dissertation eventually requires an oral defense to the student's committee. Curricula may be offered on a full-time or part-time basis. The normal duration of a doctorate should correspond to 3–5 years of full-time graduate study or 7–10 years of sustained part-time graduate study.

The D.P.A. is preceded by a master's degree, typically the [[Master of Public Administration]] or the [[Master of Public Policy]]. D.P.A. programs are most common in the United States and the Philippines. The D.P.A. degree may have a specialization such as [[management science]], [[organizational behavior]], implementation, [[non-profit management]], [[public finance]], [[national security]], [[defense policy]], [[education policy]], [[environmental policy]], [[international trade]] and [[immigration]], policy making, [[Policy analysis|policy evaluation]], program evaluation, [[criminal justice]], [[civil rights]], health and welfare, [[federalism]], [[strategic management]], [[public health]], [[administrative law]], [[social welfare]], [[tax policy]], government-business relations, [[economic policy]], and [[public management]].

== Biography ==
Erel Margalit was born in kibbutz [[Na'an]], the eldest of three siblings. His father, Itzik Margalit, was an officer in the IDF [[Armored Corps (Israel)|Armored Corps]] and one of the founders of moshav [[Kfar Haim]], and his mother, Mickey, was a founding member of moshav [[Avihayil]]. On his mother's side, he is descended from Jews who immigrated to what was then Ottoman Palestine from [[Bulgaria]] in the 19th century, prior to the beginning of the [[First Aliyah]]. He is a descendant of Shmuel Tagir, one of the founders of [[Tel Aviv]]. 

In 1969, when Margalit was eight years old, the family was sent on a mission to [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] where his father was head of a local Hebrew school.&lt;ref name="Meet the MK:Erel Margalit"/&gt; While in high school in Michigan, Erel became a point-guard on a local basketball team. After returning to Israel in 1971, the family settled in [[Karmiel]] before moving to [[Jerusalem]]. He attended Rene Cassin High School and continued to play basketball there. Recognition of his talent led to an offer to join the Israeli youth team, but he declined in favor of serving in an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] combat unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Prince-Gibson|first=Eetta|title=Erel Margalit's powerful visions|url=http://www.israel21c.org/culture/erel-margalit-s-powerful-visions|accessdate=May 2, 2011|newspaper=Israel21C|date=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the [[Golani Brigade]]'s ''"Orev"'' unit as an operations officer, reaching the rank of sergeant major. As a reservist in 1982, he fought in the [[1982 Lebanon War|First Lebanon War]] with the IDF's airborne anti-tank division.

Margalit studied philosophy and English literature at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], where he met his future wife. In 1985 Margalit moved to New York to attend [[Columbia University]] where he continued towards a doctorate in philosophy and logic. During his studies he was exposed to [[Michael Porter]]'s "The Competitive Advantage of Nations," which influenced his doctoral dissertation on the subject, "The Entrepreneur as a Leader in the Historical Process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israeli Business Forum of New York|url=http://www.israelibusinessforum.org/content/events/past_events/04-08-17erel_margalit.html|work=Speaker: Erel N. Margalit&amp;nbsp;— Founder &amp; Managing Partner, Jerusalem Venture Partners (JVP)|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he completed in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://engineering.columbia.edu/web/newsletterarchive/spring08/feature2.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623054811/http://engineering.columbia.edu/web/newsletterarchive/spring08/feature2.php |archivedate=2010-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the [[First Intifada]] and the anti-Israel activities on American campuses, Margalit organized a dialogue group between Israeli and Arab students. Together with other Israeli doctoral students, among them [[Yossi Dahan]] and [[Yossi Bachar]], he established groups on eight leading campuses.

Margalit is married to Debbie and has three daughters: Tair, Eden, and Maya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israeli Business Forum|url=http://www.israelibusinessforum.org/content/events/past_events/10-03-23-Margalit.html|work=PIONEERING ISRAEL'S NEW SOCIAL-ECONOMIC ERA:The Role of the Creative Class|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Jerusalem Development Authority ===
Returning to Israel in 1990, Margalit began to work at the [[Jerusalem Development Authority]] under Uzi Wexler, promoting business development and technological entrepreneurship in Jerusalem. During this time, he worked closely with [[Teddy Kollek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Giving Wisely|url=http://www.givingwisely.org.il/?page_id=3446&amp;amuta=580394872|work=Jerusalem Venture Partners (JVP) Community}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked in cooperation with American governors, among them [[Mario Cuomo]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pete Wilson]] of [[California]], [[James Florio]] of [[New Jersey]] and [[Rodney Wallace (Massachusetts)|Rodney Wallace]] of Massachusetts. Margalit helped to attract  dozens of technology companies to Jerusalem with the aim of turning the city into a high-tech capital for Israel. In three years, he succeeded in bringing in 70 large technology companies, including [[Digital data|Digital]] and [[IBM]]. In June 1994,  Margalit left the JDA and embarked on an independent career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Prince-Gibson|first=Eetta|title=Erel Margalit's powerful visions|url=http://www.israel21c.org/culture/erel-margalit-s-powerful-visions|accessdate=May 2, 2011|newspaper=Israel21C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jerusalem Venture Partners (JVP) ===
[[File:madpis.jpg|thumb|right|250px|JVP Media Quarter in Jerusalem]]
In 1993, Erel Margalit founded the [[Jerusalem Venture Partners|JVP]] venture capital fund. He created a new model that integrated an active management approach with a strategy of forming an international market. Under his leadership, JVP has been instrumental in building dozens of high-tech startups into global corporations operating in Israel, the United States, Europe and Asia. Under his leadership, the JVP Fund currently runs investments of approximately 850 million dollars in eight funds, and specializes in investments in media, internet, mobile telephony, advertising and gaming industries. Erel has personally led seventeen successful exits, including the sale of Chromatis Networks, to [[Lucent| Lucent Technologies]] in 2000 for $4.82 billion, the second highest amount ever paid to an Israel company after Mobileye, sold to Intel in 2017 for $15.3 billion, and the IPO of [[QlikTech|Qlik Technologies]], which as of April 2011 was valued at over $2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JVP Venture Capital|url=http://www.jvpvc.com/funds-about|work=About|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CrunchBase|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/person/erel-n-margalit|work=Erel N.

== Social entrepreneurship ==

=== In the Community ''(Bakehila)'' ===
In 2002, Marglit founded the social organization '''Bakehila''' ('''בקהילה''' "In the Community" in Hebrew) as a means of reducing the socio-economic gap affecting disadvantaged children in Jerusalem. Bakehila runs [http://bakehila.wix.com/english#!programs/ci93 '''educational programs'''] in lower socioeconomic neighborhoods of Jerusalem with the goal of raising the students' academic achievements, and promoting the children's personal and interpersonal growth. Thousands of students from Jerusalem have attended the program during its first eight years.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=JVP Venture Capital|url=http://www.jvpvc.com/community-about|title=About|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, ''Bakehila'' opened an educational enrichment center in the Arab neighborhood of [[Beit Safafa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-201573198.html Beit Safafa education center dedicated]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Lab ''(Hama'abada)'' ===
Following the events of the [[Second Intifada]] and the massive departure of young artists from Jerusalem, Erel Margalit created The Lab ''(Hama'abada)'' to keep and attract young artists in Israel's capital. The Lab provides support and assistance to these artists, providing venues for young Israelis to create, perform, and receive feedback on their work.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

== Political activism ==

=== 2005 elections ===
During the 2005 election campaign, Margalit was one of the first businessmen to support [[Amir Peretz]] in the general elections. He joined the Labor Party and expressed his support of Peretz's social agenda. Margalit promoted his vision of economic growth whereby the [[Haredi Judaism#Israel|ultra-Orthodox]] and [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab]] populations would be integrated in the labor market in Israel, thus taking them out of poverty and alleviating pressure on the middle classes. In addition, Margalit presented a plan for bringing the communities of Israel's geographic periphery closer to the center of the country, both economically and socially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andromidas|first=Dean|title=Lebanon Wire|url=http://www.lebanonwire.com/1105/05113001EIB.asp|work=Political Upset in Israel: Labor Leader To Follow Rabin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Avoda Now Movement ===
Since his initial support of the Labor Party, Margalit grew disillusioned with the direction of the party and its leadership. On January 17, 2011, the Chairman of the Labor Party, [[Ehud Barak]], announced his resignation from the Labor Party and the establishment of a new party&amp;nbsp;– "[[Atzmaut]]" (Independence Party).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2011/01/18/barak-dumps-labor/ |title=Barak dumps Labor|author=Post Staff Report|work=[[New York Post]] |date=January 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after this announcement Margalit helped to found the "Avoda Now" movement together with prominent members of Israel's business, technology, and cultural community, calling for a revival of the Labor Party. The movement launched a public campaign calling the people to join the Labor party lines; with the aim of renewing its institutions, restoring its social values, and choosing a new, dynamic leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PR Newswire|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/27/idUS272092+27-Apr-2011+PRN20110427|work=Erel Margalit Announces His Candidacy to Lead the Labor Party|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27, 2011, saying he could "no longer watch from the sidelines as the political situation in Israel deteriorates", Margalit announced his intention to run for the chairmanship of Israel's Labor Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/27/idUS272092+27-Apr-2011+PRN20110427|title=Erel Margalit Announces His Candidacy to Lead the Labor Party|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the Knesset ===
On 5 February 2013 Margalit became a Member of the Israeli Knesset&lt;ref&gt;http://www.erel.org.il/?p=2555&lt;/ref&gt; and currently serves as a member of the prestigious Finance Committee and the Science and Technology Committee. He has been called the richest member of the Knesset.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Erel-Margalit-is-not-Israels-Donald-Trump-456428 ''Jerusalem Post'', June 10, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;  Margalit was especially active in the 2013 budget discussions criticizing its lack of economic growth engines (See {{YouTube|Nqsj4p1I6wU}}), and called to cancel the bi-yearly budget.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.themarker.com/news/politics/1.1938535&lt;/ref&gt; He also led the Opposition on the discussions of the "HARIKUZIUT" bill, aimed to target the over-concentration and centralization in the Israeli economy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.themarker.com/news/politics/1.2047565&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.themarker.com/news/politics/1.2049683&lt;/ref&gt;
Margalit chairs the Parliamentary Task Forces for Economic Development in the North and the Negev,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.local.co.il/haifa/106691/article.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Civilian Cyber Protection and Combating Living Costs in Israel, and co-chairs the Parliamentary Task Force for Small and Medium Businesses, Integrating the Ultra-Orthodox in the High-Tech Sector, Employment for the Arab-Israeli Sector, 40+ Employment {{YouTube|uU_p30oKdEI}}, and the Task Force for the City of Jerusalem where he often criticizes the Israeli Government's policy of worrying about Jerusalem's borders but ignoring its content and neglecting its poor economic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kibbutz.org.il/politit-takam/meida/knesset/130512_margalit.htm?nojump |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114064001/http://www.kibbutz.org.il/politit-takam/meida/knesset/130512_margalit.htm?nojump |archivedate=2014-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Israeli Labor Party leadership election, 2013|2013 Labor Party leadership election]] Margalit announced his support for the candidacy of MK [[Isaac Herzog]] for chairman.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jdn.co.il/news/255341&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/iw/contents/articles/originals/2013/11/labor-party-shelly-yachimovich-erel-margalit-isaac-herzog.html&lt;/ref&gt; Margalit was re-elected to the Knesset in the [[Israeli legislative election, 2015|2015 elections]]. In 2017 he contested the Labor Party leadership election, but was knocked out in the first round of voting. He subsequently resigned from the Knesset in October 2017 and was replaced by [[Leah Fadida]].&lt;ref name=TOI&gt;[https://www.timesofisrael.com/labor-mk-margalit-quits-knesset-in-second-party-resignation-in-week/ Labor MK Margalit quits Knesset, in second party resignation in week] Times of Israel, 3 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone''' ({{IPA-it|franˈtʃesko ɡa.eˈtaːno kaltadʒiˈroːne}}; born 1943) is an [[Italy|Italian]] businessman. He controls the holding company [[Caltagirone S.p.A.]] with interests in cement manufacturing, real estate, construction and publishing (with [[Caltagirone Editore]]).

As of 2015, Caltagirone was ranked number #894 on the 2015 ''Forbes'' billionaire list and #19 in Italy, with an estimated net worth of $2.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/profile/francesco-gaetano-caltagirone/?list=billionaires |title= Billionaires (2015): #894 Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone |work= Forbes |date= February 2015 |quote= Net worth: $2.1 billion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone was born in [[Rome]] into a large family composed almost entirely of manufacturers. His grandfather constructed the first buildings in [[Palermo]] in the last decades of the 1800s.

While studying at the faculty of engineering in Rome, Caltagirone and his brothers Edoardo Francesco Caltagirone and Leonardo Francesco Caltagirone resumed the family business that had been interrupted in the forties because of the sudden death of their father. With the inherited capital, the brothers started the company together with their cousin Gaetano Caltagirone, an architect already working as a manufacturer.

Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone became a partner in the company. Since then the group (today known as the Caltagirone Group or Caltagirone S.p.A) has constructed approximately 200 real estate complexes, composed of nearly 800 buildings with a total area of close to 3.3 million square metres and a value of €15 billion.

In the seventies the equity balance between Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone and his cousin Gaetano Caltagirone was changed, and Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone became part of the majority shareholders – on an equal footing with his brother Edoardo Francesco Caltagirone.

In 1984 he took over [[Vianini Lavori]] S.p.A. – now part of the Caltagirone Group – which operates worldwide in the field of large infrastructure project. He became president of the company. After a complete industrial restructuring, he carried out the listing of the two subsidiaries, Vianini Lavori S.p.A Industry and [[Vianini Industria]] S.p.A.

[[File:Il Presidente Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone alla festa di restyling de "Il Messaggero"..jpg|thumb|right|President Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone at the “Restyling Party” for the ''[[Il Messaggero]]'' newspaper, held in Milan in December 2012]]
[[File:Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone al programma Otto e Mezzo di Lilly Gruber 004.png|thumb|right|President Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone interviewed at Lilly Gruber's television program ''Otto e Mezzo'' on La7 channel]]

In 1992 he took over [[Cementir]] S.p.A, the fourth biggest Italian company in the cement industry, acquired by IRI ([[Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale]]) through a public auction. In a few years, under the guidance of his son Francesco Caltagirone Jr., Cementir S.p.A became a multinational company with significant presence in Scandinavia, Turkey and the Far East. About 80% of the turnover is produced outside Italy.

In the mid-nineties he assumed full control of the Caltagirone Group joining his shares with those of his cousin Gaetano Caltagirone in the company Finanziaria Italia. Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone holds approximately 70% of Finanziaria Italia, which controls about 51% of Caltagirone S.p.A.

In 1996 he acquired the Roman newspaper ''[[Il Messaggero]]'' from the Montedison Group, and the following year two local newspapers from private investors: ''[[Il Mattino]]'' based in [[Naples]] and ''[[Il Corriere Adriatico]]'' based in [[Ancona]].

Since 2000 all publishing and new media have been clustered in the [[Caltagirone Editore]] publishing group – the fifth biggest group in Italy. In 2006 he acquired the majority stake in the newspaper ''[[Il Gazzettino]]'' based in [[Venice]].

Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone is a member of the Executive Committee of [[Confindustria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=ansa.it |url=http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/economia/2013/05/22/Confindustria-Caltagirone-giunta_8749930.html |title=Confindustria: Caltagirone in giunta |publisher=Ansa |date=22 May 2013 |accessdate=10 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Committee of the President of the Italian Federation of Newspaper Publishers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=fieg.it |url=http://www.fieg.it/salastampa_item.asp?sta_id=713&amp;language=en |title=FIEG: Rinnovate le cariche sociali per il biennio 2012 – 2014 |publisher=Federazione italiana editori giornali |date=11 June 2012 |accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he is a director of the Auditorium [[Parco della Musica]] of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=http://roma.corriere.it/roma/notizie/cronaca/11_maggio_19/cda-auditorium-nomine-190680548742.shtml |title=Auditorium nomine ai vertici. Alemanno conferma Fuortes |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=19 May 2011 |accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 he was appointed a Knight of the [[Order of Merit for Labour]]. In the same year he became vice-president of [[Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena]]. Until early 2012, when he liquidated his share completely, he was the second largest shareholder and the most important private individual shareholder. In 2007 he was appointed Director of [[Assicurazioni Generali]] S.p.A, of which he was appointed Vice President in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=fieg.it |url=http://www.fieg.it/Generali-Group/Governance/corporate-bodies/members-of-the-board-of-directors/Vice-Chairman-Francesco-Gaetano-Caltagirone/ |title=Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone |publisher=Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A. |date=22 May 2013 |accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is married to Luisa Farinon (the sister of former TV presenter [[Gabriella Farinon|Gabriella]]) and has three children: Francesco Jr., Alessandro and Azzurra,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=http://cinquantamila.corriere.it/storyTellerThread.php?threadId=CALTAGIRONE+Francesco+Gaetano |title=Caltagirone Francesco Gaetano |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=5 October 2008 |accessdate=10 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the wife of the Italian politician [[Pier Ferdinando Casini]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6029">The '''Freedom to Speak Up Review''' was a review into [[whistleblowing]] in the [[NHS in England]]. It was announced on 24 June 2014 and it was chaired by [[Robert Francis (barrister)|Sir Robert Francis]].&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Borland Daily Mail (25 June 2014) [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2668566/NHS-gripped-culture-fear-Inquiry-whistleblowing-set-barrister-investigated-Mid-Staffs.html NHS is still gripped by a culture of fear: Inquiry into whistleblowing set up by barrister who investigated Mid Staffs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedomtospeakup.org.uk/|title=Freedom to Speak Up Review|website=webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20150218150343/https://freedomtospeakup.org.uk/|archivedate=2015-02-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review was originally expected to report in November 2014 but took longer because of a huge volume of input material: 17,500 online responses and 600 postal responses.&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Borland Daily Mail (21 January 2015) [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2919200/Probe-NHS-whistleblowers-swamped-18-000-replies.html Probe into NHS whistleblowers is swamped by 18,000 replies: Officials tried to push back report after being deluged with comments by concerned staff]&lt;/ref&gt;

The report was published on 11 February 2015.&lt;ref name="Guardian 11Feb2105"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/11/nhs-whistleblowers-report-offers-no-prescription-cover-up-culture |title=NHS whistleblowers report offers no prescription for ending cover-up culture |first=Denis |last=Campbell |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=11 February 2015 |accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recommendations==
Francis outlined twenty principles and associated actions, then concluded by making just two recommendations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://cri.sagepub.com/content/20/6/128.short |title=Francis’s ‘‘Freedom to Speak Up’’ review: An openness and transparency revolution or just another report? |first=Peter |last=Walsh |journal=Clinical Risk |date= November 2014 |volume=20 |issue=6 |page=128 |doi=10.1177/1356262215575958}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# for all NHS organisations and regulators to implement all the principles and actions;
# for the Secretary of State to review progress annually.

The twenty principles to allow a consistent approach to raising concerns, while still allowing some flexibility, included:&lt;ref name=Parry&gt;Lizzie Parry Daily Mail (11 February 2015) [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2948871/NHS-staff-scared-speak-poor-care-Climate-fear-leaves-worried-bullied-lose-job-speak-up.html Climate of fear leaves NHS whistleblowers 'on the brink of suicide' says report but campaigners warn new measures to protect workers 'don't go far enough']&lt;/ref&gt;
* Culture of raising concerns - to make raising issues a part of normal routine business of any well-led NHS organisation.
* Culture free from bullying - freedom of staff to speak out relies on staff being able to work in a culture which is free from bullying.
* Training - every member of staff should receive training in their trust's approach to raising concerns and in receiving and acting on them. 
* Support - all NHS trusts should ensure there is a dedicated person to whom concerns can be easily reported and without formality, a "Freedom to Speak Up Guardian" .
* Support to find alternative employment in the NHS - where a worker who has raised a concern cannot, as a result, continue their role, the NHS should help them seek an alternative job.

The consultancy’s core publication is the annual ''Gold Survey'', which began in 1967.

After the take over, a company was formed the same year to continue the survey.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

Between 1994 and 1998, the company was owned by [[Gold Fields|Gold Fields of South Africa]].&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

Between 1998 and 2003, the company was known as Gold Fields Mineral Services Limited.&lt;ref&gt;https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/03593787&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, members of the research team completed a management buy out of GFMS from GFSA, and the consultancy gained full independence. In 2002, GFMS became an associate member of the [[London Bullion Market Association]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

'''George Embiricos''' ({{lang-el|Γεώργιος Α. Εμπειρίκος}}, ''Andreas A. Empeirikos''; 1920–2011) was a Greek shipping magnate, and art collector, who owned several masterpieces by [[El Greco]], [[Goya]], [[Cézanne]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], [[Picasso]], [[van Gogh]] and [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Bacon]], in his home in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/BID/3932445423x0x603708/E2429263-816B-4A36-9E0B-D733DB6E4C1D/603708.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cezannecatalogue.com/collections/entry.php?id=346&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early and professional life==
Embiricos attended Cambridge prior to the outbreak of [[World War II]] and subsequently obtained a law degree from the University of Athens. He then joined the family shipping business in London. In the late 1940s he moved to New York with his wife and set up his own shipping office. He started collecting art in New York while continuing his career for many years in the shipping business.&lt;ref&gt;http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/BID/3932445423x0x603708/E2429263-816B-4A36-9E0B-D733DB6E4C1D/603708.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; One of his innovations in shipping was conceiving the modern bulk carrier in 1954. While in New York he had two sons.

==Personal life==
Embiricos's estate included the superyacht, Astarte II, and many other famous artworks. Notably, he sold the [[Paul Cezanne]] painting, ''[[The Card Players]]'', for somewhere between $259 and $320 million reportedly to the Royal Family of Qatar in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.superyachtfan.com/superyacht_owners_register_a_b.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/abigailesman/2012/02/06/the-250-million-dollar-cezanne-what-does-it-mean-to-you/&lt;/ref&gt; It was the [[List_of_most_expensive_paintings|most expensive painting]] sold up to that time.

'''Gérard J. Corboud''' (18 May 1925 – 5 March 2017) was a Swiss entrepreneur, art collector and philanthropist.

From the late-1970s onwards, Corboud and his wife Marisol acquired works by the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, and later the Neo-Impressionists. In 2001, they made a "permanent loan" of their collection of over 170 works to the [[Wallraf-Richartz Museum]] in [[Cologne]], Germany, which was renamed the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum &amp; Fondation Corboud.&lt;ref name="wallraf1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wallraf.museum/en/the-museum/history/fondation-corboud/ |title=Fondation Corboud: Wallraf-Richartz-Museum |website=Wallraf.museum |date=5 March 2017 |accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their collection includes works by Auguste Renoir, Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh,&lt;ref name="wallraf1"/&gt; and is the largest Impressionist collection in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hatjecantz.de/masters-of-impressionism-2019-1.html |title=Masters of Impressionism &amp;#124; Classical Modern Art &amp;#124; Hatje Cantz |website=Hatjecantz.de |date=14 January 1945 |accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international financial activities help the organizations to connect with international dealings with overseas business partners- customers, [[suppliers]], lenders etc. It is also used by [[government]] organization and non-profit institutions.

== History and background ==

During the post-war years, the [[GATT]] was established in order to improve trade. It removed the trade barriers notably over the years, as a result of which international trade grew manifold. The financial participation of the trader's exporters and importers and the international transactions flowed significantly. 
It started when different countries started “liberalizing” i.e. when countries agreed to open doors for each other and traded. The advancement of technology and liberalization resulted in the idea of financial management both domestically and globally.

== Domestic vs international financial management (IFM)==

Financial Systems may be classified as domestic or overseas, closed or open. A ‘domestic’ is one inside a country. Thus financial system in the {{US}}, is an international financial system from the {{IND}} view.
The mean and objective of both domestic and international financial management remains the same but the dimensions and dynamics broaden drastically.
Foreign currency, market imperfections, enhanced opportunity sets and political risks are four broader heads under which IFM can be differentiated from financial management (FM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Difference between International and Domestic Financial Management:|url=http://www.efinancemanagement.com/international-financial-management/74-international-financial-management|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The goal of IFM is not only limited to maximization of [[shareholders]] but also [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s.

== Importance ==

Compared to national financial markets international markets have a different shape and analytics. Proper management of international finances can help the organization in achieving same efficiency and effectiveness in all markets, hence without IFM sustaining in the market can be difficult.

Companies are motivated to invest capital in abroad for the following reasons
* Efficiently produce products in [[foreign corporation|foreign]] [[Market (economics)|markets]] than that domestically.
* Obtain the essential raw materials needed for production.
* Broaden [[Market (economics)|markets]] and diversify
* Earn higher returns
*foreign investment

==Development==
In late 2011, [[JCPenney]] issued a request for proposals to develop the 240 acres of land surrounding its regional headquarters in Plano.&lt;ref name="sbrown031314"&gt;Steve Brown, [https://www.dallasnews.com/business/real-estate/2014/03/13/office-campus-shops-and-high-rise-hotel-in-the-works-for-big-plano-development "Office campus, shops and high-rise hotel in the works for big Plano development,"] ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'', March 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The surrounding property had been vacant since JCPenney purchased the land in 1987, to relocate its headquarters to Texas from New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony DePalma, [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/29/nyregion/jc-penney-plans-move-to-dallas-from-new-york-consultants-say.html "Why Penney Is Moving to the Prairies,"] ''[[New York Times]]'', August 23, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sedelson"&gt;Sharon Edelson, [http://wwd.com/business-news/retail/legacy-west-is-bringing-new-brands-to-north-texas-10870904/ "Legacy West Is Bringing New Brands to North Texas,"] ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'', April 20, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, JCPenney came to an agreement with local real estate firms Karahan Companies, KDC and Columbus Realty Partners to develop the land. Construction started later that year, with the developers planning a luxury hotel tower, corporate office space, urban shopping center and apartments.&lt;ref name="sbrown031314"/&gt; When [[Toyota]] announced soon after that it would be moving its North American headquarters to the site from [[Torrance, California]], developers pushed up the timetable for the project.&lt;ref name="slester"&gt;Sean Lester, [https://www.dallasnews.com/business/real-estate/2015/02/03/construction-starting-on-huge-legacy-west-mixed-use-project-in-plano "Construction starting on huge Legacy West mixed-use project in Plano,"] ''Dallas Morning News'', February 3, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Hirsch, [http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-toyota-move-20140429-story.html "3,000 Toyota jobs to move to Texas from Torrance,"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', April 29, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steve Brown, [https://www.dallasnews.com/business/business/2014/04/29/landing-toyota-headquarters-has-pushed-up-the-timetable-for-planos-legacy-west-project "Landing Toyota headquarters has pushed up the timetable for Plano's Legacy West project,"] ''Dallas Morning News'', April 29, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 2017, Legacy West officially opened the shopping district to the public.

In late 2017 construction continued on projects anchoring the northern end of the retail and entertainment district, including Legacy Hall, a three-story food hall that will have more than two-dozen stalls featuring food concepts from restaurateurs including Dallas-based chef John Tesar and [[Chili's]] founder Larry Lavine.&lt;ref name="sedelson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Pugh, [https://communityimpact.com/guides/dallas-fort-worth/plano/news/commerce/2017/10/27/legacy-hall-opening-date-moved-plus-3-other-updates-about-planos-legacy-west/ "Legacy Hall opening date moved, plus 3 other updates about Plano's Legacy West,"] ''Community Impact'', October 27, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Rockey, [http://planomagazine.com/legacy-hall/ "Legacy Hall,"] ''Plano Magazine'', October 30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Legacy Hall will also house a brewery and tap room from Unlawful Assembly Brewing Company.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Robinson-Jacobs, [https://www.dallasnews.com/business/restaurants/2017/10/20/coming-new-food-hall-planos-legacy-west "Here's what's coming to the new food hall at Plano's Legacy West,"] ''Dallas Morning News'', October 20, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NewMusicSA''' is the South African section of the [[International Society for Contemporary Music]] (ISCM). Its formation on 10 May 1999 heralded the return of South African representation at the ISCM after many decades.&lt;ref&gt;Blake 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heuvelmans 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nature and Purpose ==
NewMusicSA is a non-profit organisation which supports the creation and performance of New Music by South African composers of all stylistic and cultural backgrounds.  The organisation holds annual new music festivals, commissions works, puts out calls for scores and runs the South African New Music Ensemble.  It publishes the NewMusicSA Bulletin, an annual periodical offering articles on current New Music events, issues, composers and performers, together with scores of recent works by South African composers.  It provides information services for current events in the form of its monthly newsletter, and aims to foster collaboration and a sense of community among its members and the wider New Music community.

== Annual Festival ==

Since 2000, the organisation has held an annual festival, the New Music Indaba, which showcases contemporary South African music performed by musicians based both within the country and abroad. A central part of the festival are the 'Growing Composers' workshops, which provide the opportunity for emerging composers to work with established musicians and composers in a supportive environment. From 2000 to 2006, the New Music Indaba was held as part of the National Arts Festival in [[Grahamstown]] in the [[Eastern Cape]] province. From 2007 to 2009 the festival was hosted by the [[University of South Africa]] (UNISA) in Pretoria/Tshwane, Gauteng.  
{{Infobox music festival

| image =
| caption =
| location =Johannesburg and Durban
| years_active =
| founders =

| genre = [[Electronic music]],

}}
NewMusicSA also runs the '''Unyazi Electronic Music Festival''', which alternates with the New Music Indaba on an annual basis. Since 2010 the two festivals have been hosted variously in Johannesburg and Durban.  The 2014 Unyazi Electronic Music Festival was held in Johannesburg, hosted by the University of the Witwatersrand School of Arts.

Other notable projects include [[The Bow Project]], which commissioned numerous composers to write new pieces for string quartet based on the uhadi bow music of [[Nofinishi Dywili]].

== Exchange Programmes and Collaborations ==
NewMusicSA has provided an important link between South African art music composers and the international contemporary art music community by means of an exchange programme with the Visby International Centre for Composers (VICC). This programme has provided residencies for numerous South African composers in [[Gotland]], Sweden. The most recent call for applicants took place in 2014, the residencies being awarded to Samora Ntsebeza and Pierre-Henri Wicomb.

Since its foundation, NewMusicSA has worked with a number of other South African music and cultural organisations, such as the [[Southern African Music Rights Organisation]] (SAMRO), the Unisa Music Foundation and most recently the [[South African National Youth Orchestra Foundation|South African National Youth Orchestra]] to provide opportunities for emerging South African composers.

In 2008 the archive of NewMusicSA, which includes much documentary information and numerous unique music scores by South African composers was donated to the Documentation Centre for Music at the [[University of Stellenbosch]] in the Western Cape province.

== ISCM World Music Days Festival ==
An important aspect of the organisation's role is to convene an annual jury to select South African works that will be considered for performance at the ISCM's World Music Days festival. South African composers whose works have been selected for performance at the World Music Days Festival by the ISCM's international jury in recent years include, [[Robert Fokkens]] (2009), Clare Loveday (2008) and [[Stefans Grové]] (2007). In the past the music of [[Bongani Ndodana-Breen]], [[Kevin Volans]], Hans Huyssen, Mokale Koapeng, [[Hendrik Hofmeyr]], [[Jürgen Bräuninger]] has also been heard at the festival.  The 2015 festival will see the performance of another South African work.

== South African New Music Ensemble ==
In 2013 NewMusicSA founded the South African New Music Ensemble (SANME), a chamber ensemble of variable instrumentation formulated with the purpose of bringing together performers and composers of new music in South Africa.  The ensemble played its debut performance at the 2013 New Music Indaba at the University of KwaZulu-Natal Howard College Campus.  In the same year NewMusicSA issued its first commissions in a call for scores for two works to be played by the ensemble.  The call was for one entirely instrumental/acoustic work and one mixed electronic/acoustic work.  The acoustic commission was awarded to Pierre-Henri Wicomb.  The electronic/acoustic commission was awarded to Maxim Starcke.

== Board and Past presidents ==
The board members as of 2014 are:

Mr Chris Jeffery – Chair&lt;br /&gt;
Mr Douglas Scott – Treasurer&lt;br /&gt;
Mr William Fourie – Secretary &amp; Vice-Chair&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3220">'''Power to the edge''' refers to the ability of an organization to dynamically synchronize its actions; achieve [[Command and control (military)|command and control]] (C2) agility; and increase the speed of command over a robust, networked grid. The term is most commonly used in relation to military organizations, but it can equally be used in a civilian context.

"Power to the edge" is an information and organization management philosophy first articulated by the U.S. Department of Defense in a publication by Dr. [[David S. Alberts]] and Richard E. Hayes in 2003 titled: "Power to the Edge: Command...Control...in the Information Age." This book was published by the [[Command and Control Research Program]] and can be downloaded from the [http://www.dodccrp.org/ Program's website].

==Principles==
Power to the edge advocates the following:

*Achieving situational awareness rather than creating a single operational picture
*Self-synchronizing operations instead of autonomous operations
*Information "pull" rather than broadcast information "push"
*Collaborative efforts rather than individual efforts
*Communities of Interest (COIs) rather than stovepipes
*"Task, post, process, use" rather than "task, process, exploit, disseminate"
*Handling information once rather than handling multiple data calls
*Sharing data rather than maintaining private data
*Persistent, continuous information assurance rather than perimeter, one-time security
*Bandwidth on demand rather than bandwidth limitations
*IP-based transport rather than circuit-based transport
*Net-Ready KPP rather than interoperability KPP
*Enterprise services rather than separate infrastructures
*COTS based, net-centric capabilities rather than customized, platform-centric IT

==Agility==
The philosophy of power to the edge is aimed at achieving organizational agility. Such agility has six attributes:

*Robustness: the ability to maintain effectiveness across a range of tasks, situations, and conditions
*Resilience: the ability to recover from or adjust to misfortune, damage, or a destabilizing perturbation in the environment
*Responsiveness: the ability to react to a change in the environment in a timely manner
*Flexibility: the ability to employ multiple ways to succeed and the capacity to move seamlessly between them
*Innovation: the ability to do new things and the ability to do old things in new ways
*Adaptation: the ability to change work processes and the ability to change the organization

He was named on the [[Estates Gazette]] 2017 'Power List', which lists the 50 most powerful individuals in Britain's commercial real estate sector. Mulryan was the only Irish person to be named on the list, which included US Billionaire and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] founder [[Jeff Bezos]] and the Chairman of [[C C Land|CC Land]], Cheung Chung Kiu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/commercial-property/mulryan-joins-jeff-bezos-on-uk-property-power-list-35875057.html|title=Mulryan joins Jeff Bezos on UK property 'power list' |work=The Irish Independent|access-date=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Sean Mulryan was born in September 1954,&lt;ref name=CH&gt;{{cite web|title=BALLYMORE LIMITED|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04936525/officers|website=Companies House|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of John and Josephine Mulryan.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; He grew up in rural poverty in the village of Oran, near [[Castlerea]], Co Roscommon,&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref name=SC/&gt; in the west of Ireland, in a farming family with seven children.&lt;ref name=HP&gt;''Homes &amp; Property'': [http://www.homesandproperty.co.uk/property-news/news/sean-mulryan-man-who-owns-land-every-corner-london Sean Mulryan: the man who owns land in every corner of Londo], accessdate: 1 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Mulryan left school at the age of 17, and trained as a bricklayer. Aged 19, he bought his first plot of land.&lt;ref name=HP/&gt; At 26 he set up his own company and shortly afterwards founded Ballymore, which is now considered one Europe's biggest property developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.roscommonpeople.ie/archive/55-archives/at-home-with-sean-mulryan|title=At home with Sean Mulryan – Roscommon People – The People's Paper|last=People|first=Roscommon|access-date=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ballymore Group==
Ballymore Group was founded in 1982 by Mulryan, then aged 28, who is the chairman. David Brophy is the group chief executive.&lt;ref name=PR&gt;prnewswire.co.uk: [http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/ballymore-announces-group-reorganisation-152879555.html Ballymore Announces Group Reorganisation – DUBLIN, July 3 /PR Newswire UK/ --], accessdate: 30 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballymore has become one of the biggest providers of residential space in London.&lt;ref name=IrishTimes&gt;irishtimes.com: [http://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/homes-and-property/the-irish-developer-with-a-big-vision-for-london-1.2284778 The Irish developer with a big vision for London --]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2017, it was reported that the previous year's profits at the UK arm of Ballymore had increased almost three-fold to £154.9m (€217.6m).&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;independent.ie: [http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/exceptional-gains-push-sean-mulryans-ballymore-uk-profits-to-217m-34342258.html  Exceptional gains push Sean Mulryan's Ballymore UK profits to €217m --]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballymore Group works on large-scale projects in London and across Europe, with a particular focus on urban regeneration.

In 2016, it was reported that Oran native Sean Mulryan launched the latest development in Dublin, 
which is a €700&amp;nbsp;million development in the docklands.&lt;ref name=RoscommonDaily&gt;roscommondaily.com: [http://roscommondaily.com/2016/10/oran-native-700m-ballymore/ Oran native launches €700m Ballymore development --]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several members of the Mulryan family have been involved in Ballymore. John Mulryan is a son of Sean Mulryan and the managing director of Ballymore UK, meanwhile, Sean's brother Donal Mulryan used to work for Ballymore before starting his own development company, West Properties, which owns various developments in the UK, including Skyline Central, the tallest apartment complex in Manchester.&lt;ref name=IrishTimes2&gt;irishtimes.com: [http://www.irishtimes.com/business/commercial-property/docklands-project-brings-ballymore-back-to-centre-stage-1.2819321 Docklands project brings Ballymore back to centre stage --]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BDCMagazine&gt;bdcmagazine.com: [http://www.bdcmagazine.com/building-news/construction-news/housing/8744-8744 Featuring Ballymore: Interview With Sean Mulryan (Chairman &amp; Group Chief Executive) --]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, he is one of the richest men in Ireland.&lt;ref name=HP/&gt; According to London's ''[[The Evening Standard]]'', Mulryan owns more land in London than the [[Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster|Duke of Westminster]].&lt;ref name=HP/&gt;

On 16 February 2012, Wandsworth Council approved [[Ballymore Group]]'s plans for the 15 acre development in [[Nine Elms]]. [[Embassy Gardens]] is set to provide "up to 1,982 new homes alongside shops, cafes, bars, restaurants, business space, a 100 bed hotel, a health centre, children's playgrounds and sports pitches".&lt;ref name=Wandsworth&gt;Wandsworth Council: [http://www.wandsworth.gov.uk/news/article/11030/embassy_gardens_plans_approved Embassy Gardens plans approved | Wandsworth Council], accessdate: 9 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it was reported that Mulryan had engaged [[Lazard]] and [[CBRE Group]] to raise about €2.5bn to fund the Embassy Gardens development.&lt;ref name=Independent.ie&gt;Independent.ie: [http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/nick-webb-mulryan-is-close-to-wiping-slate-clean-30301129.html Nick Webb: Mulryan is close to wiping slate clean], accessdate: 1 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of his work with Ballymore, Mulryan is set to join the board of the Ireland West Airport Knock in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quinlan|first1=Ronald|title=Knock Airport to bring Ballymore's Mulryan on board|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/knock-airport-to-bring-ballymores-mulryan-on-board-35687591.html|website=The Irish Independent|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knock confirmed the appointment in May 2017, along with two other new Directors. The airport is considered key for regional development and it expects to handle around 750,000 passengers in 2017, making it its busiest year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/transport-and-tourism/sean-mulryan-joins-knock-airport-board-1.3103015|title=Sean Mulryan joins Knock Airport board|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Mulryan and his wife Bernadine live at the [[Ardenode Stud]], County Kildare, with five children. They are very active in horse racing and own "somewhere between 50 and 100" racehorses, trained in Ireland and France.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref name=SC&gt;Shopping Centre: [http://www.shopping-centre.co.uk/news/archivestory.php/aid/1135/Mulryan_of_many_talents.html Mulryan of many talents], accessdate: 1 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Among his top horses was Forget the Past, which was a multiple winner at the highest level over jumps and trained by Michael O’Brien, who handled a number of Mulryan-owned horses. He also owned flat horses, including Thewayyouare, which was once considered to be a strong contender for [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/construction/ballymore-puts-the-building-boom-back-into-horse-racing-1.3047540|title=Ballymore puts the building boom back into horse racing|work=The Irish Times|access-date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Mulryan's Ballymore Properties sponsored the headline race on the last day of the [[Punchestown Racecourse|Punchestown]] National Hunt Festival. Worth over €100,000, the Ballymore Handicap Hurdle is run over two and a half miles and is one of the most hotly contested races of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kildare-nationalist.ie/2017/04/20/naas-all-set-for-punchestown/|title=Kildare Nationalist – Naas all set for Punchestown|access-date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His friends include the athlete and politician [[Seb Coe]] and [[Bono]], the singer in the Irish pop group [[U2]]. [[Debbie Harry]], of the pop group [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] sang at his 50th birthday party.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;

==Background==

After leaving [[Spinnaker Software|Spinnaker]] in 1986, he used $20,000 in savings to found Seth Godin Productions, primarily a book packaging business, out of a studio apartment in New York City.&lt;ref name="businessweek"&gt;{{cite news |title=Entrepreneur Profiles: Point, Click--And Here's The Pitch: Yoyodyne uses prizes to get you to read those online ads |url=http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/news/columns/98-06/e3564029.htm |first=Mary |last=Kuntz |newspaper=BusinessWeek |date=September 9, 1998 |accessdate=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then met Mark Hurst and founded [[Yoyodyne]]. After a few years, Godin sold the book packaging business to his employees and focused his efforts on Yoyodyne, where he promoted the concept of [[permission marketing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/34360/permission-marketing |title=Permission Marketing |date=March 31, 1998 |first=William C. |last=Taylor |work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |accessdate=October 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business ventures==
[[Yoyodyne]], launched in 1995, used contests, online games, and scavenger hunts to market companies to participating users. In August 1996, [[Flatiron Partners]] invested $4 million in Yoyodyne in return for a 20% stake.&lt;ref name=businessweek /&gt;&lt;ref name=earthweb&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.earthweb.com/bus-news/article.php/22911 |title=Yahoo! to Acquire Yoyodyne|publisher=Earthweb News|date=October 12, 1998|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050214154346/http://news.earthweb.com/bus-news/article.php/22911|archivedate=2005-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Yoyodyne, Godin published ''Permission Marketing: Turning strangers into friends and friends into customers''. In 1998, he sold Yoyodyne to [[Yahoo!]] for about $30 million&lt;ref name=CNET&gt;{{cite web |last=Junnarkar |first=Sandeep |title=Yahoo to buy Yoyodyne |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-216555.html |work=CNET News |accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wired&gt;[https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/1998/10/15555 Yahoo Acquiring Yoyodyne] ''[[Wired.com]]''.

'''Thomas Morrison Carnegie''' (October 2, 1843 – October 19, 1886) was a Scottish-born American [[Business magnate|industrialist]]. He was the brother of [[steel]] magnate [[Andrew Carnegie]] and co-founder of the [[Edgar Thomson Steel Works]] (a steel manufacturing company).

==Early life==
[[File:Birthplace of Andrew Carnegie, Dunfermline.jpg|thumb|left|Birthplace of Thomas Carnegie in Dunfermline, Scotland.]]
He was born in [[Dunfermline]], [[Fife]], Scotland, on October 2, 1843.&lt;ref&gt;Sources differ substantially on whether Thomas Carnegie was born in 1843 or 1844.  A footnote by the editors of Andrew Carnegie's book ''[[The Gospel of Wealth]]'' lists the date as 1843. Other sources agree. See: Carnegie, 1962, p. 37 fn. 1; Burlingame, 1992, p. 31; "Andrew Carnegie," in ''Encyclopedia Americana,'' 1966, p. 633; Warren, 2000, p. 391; "Carnegie, Andrew," in ''Appletons' Cyclopaedia of American Biography,'' 1887, p. 529.  However, a number of authoritative sources place his date of birth in 1844.  See:  Swank, 1892, p. 417; Boardman, 1979, p. 88; Dilsaver, 2004, p. 37; Seabrook, 2004, p. 96.  This article uses the date given in Andrew Carnegie's book.&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were Will and Margaret Carnegie, and he had a brother, Andrew, who was eight years older.&lt;ref name="Seabrook9697"&gt;Seabrook, 2004, pp. 96&amp;ndash;97.&lt;/ref&gt; A sister, Ann, had been born in 1840 but died in infancy.&lt;ref&gt;Tedlow, 2001, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; His first cousin was future industrialist [[George Lauder (Scottish industrialist)|George Lauder]].{{sfn|Bostaph|2017|page=18}} His father was a master [[Weaving|weaver]], and his mother sold food in the home and sewed soles on leather boots to help provide income.&lt;ref name="Seabrook9697" /&gt; Left destitute by automation (which threw his father, a hand weaver, out of work), the family emigrated to the [[United States]] in 1848 and settled in "Slabtown"—an immigrant neighborhood in [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania|Allegheny City]], at the time a distinct and fast-growing city on the north side of the [[Allegheny River|Allegheny]] and [[Ohio River]]s across from [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;Seabrook, 2004, pp. 98&amp;ndash;99; Tedlow, 2001, pp. 25&amp;ndash;26.&lt;/ref&gt; The family rented rooms from a relative who owned a house at 336 Rebecca Street.&lt;ref&gt;Derbyshire, 2008, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; (The street is gone, replaced by [[Three Rivers Stadium]] [[American football|football]] stadium.)&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, 2006, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Allegheny City was an unpleasant place to live. It had no municipal water system until 1848, no [[natural gas]] lines until 1853, and no sewer system, and wild hogs roamed the streets attacking children.&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, 2006, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; There, Thomas attended local public school.&lt;ref&gt;Derbyshire, 2008, pp. 69&amp;ndash;70; Nasaw, 2006, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a boy, Thomas Carnegie was "the beautiful white-haired child with lustrous black eyes, who everywhere attracted attention".&lt;ref&gt;Tedlow, 2001, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; He was generally considered well-mannered but reserved,&lt;ref name="Seab99"&gt;Seabrook, 2004, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; and often went into a quiet room during social gatherings.&lt;ref name="nasaw139"&gt;Nasaw, 2006, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also noted for his quick and wry sense of humor.&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, 1903, p.&amp;nbsp;44.&lt;/ref&gt; And while some, such as Andrew Carnegie biographer [[Joseph Frazier Wall]] have concluded that Margaret Carnegie secretly favored Thomas, others such as [[Richard S. Tedlow]] disagree and conclude that Thomas was largely isolated and lonely within the extended Carnegie family and their large coterie of friends.&lt;ref name="tedl3334"&gt;Tedlow, 2001, pp. 33&amp;ndash;34.&lt;/ref&gt; It is well documented that Andrew and Thomas did not have the same group of friends, and that Thomas' group was smaller.&lt;ref name="Bridge15"&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; In time, Thomas Carnegie became a lifelong heavy drinker.&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, 2006, p. 286; Tedlow, 2001, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Derb92"&gt;Derbyshire, 2008, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Andrew and Thomas Carnegie - Project Gutenberg eText 17976.jpg|upright|thumb|Thomas Carnegie, age 12, with his older brother, Andrew.]]
His older brother Andrew made a good deal of money from stock investing, and in 1853 purchased their rented home on Rebecca Street.&lt;ref&gt;Derbyshire, 2008, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1858, after Andrew had been appointed Thomas Scott's assistant, the Carnegie family sold their Rebecca Street home and bought a large home in [[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]].&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, 2006, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;  Andrew was appointed superintendent of the western division of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] in 1859, and he made Thomas (who had quit school) his assistant.&lt;ref name="Bridge15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Derb72"&gt;Derbyshire, 2008, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; (This was not the end of Thomas' schooling.  As an adult, he would later take classes at [[Duff's Business Institute|Duff College]].)&lt;ref&gt;Skrabec, 2010, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, the family moved back to Pittsburgh and resided at 10 Hancock Street (later renamed Eighth Street, and now part of the [[Downtown Pittsburgh]] central business district).&lt;ref name="Derb72" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, 2006, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; But the pollution from nearby factories and iron forges proved too much, and after only a few short months on Hancock Street, Andrew purchased a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] home for Thomas and their mother in [[Homewood (Pittsburgh)|Homewood]], then a middle-class village on the edge of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref name="Seab99" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Derbyshire, 2008, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  Andrew and Thomas rode the train to and from work together, and attended the theater frequently.&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, 2006, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1861, Andrew persuaded Thomas to invest in the Columbia Oil Company, and it paid off handsomely.&lt;ref&gt;Seabrook, 2004, pp. 99&amp;ndash;100; Bridge, 1903, p. 14; Standiford, 2005, pp. 32&amp;ndash;33.&lt;/ref&gt;  That Andrew Carnegie should ask an 18-year-old boy to be a stock investor was not unusual.  When Andrew traveled to Scotland with his mother and a friend in 1862, he left Thomas in charge of his numerous business affairs (assets by that time nearing $47,860 or roughly $8.5 million in 2009 inflation-adjusted dollars).&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, 2006, pp. 81&amp;ndash;82, 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Union Iron Mills===
Thomas' business ventures were often pulled along in the wake of his older brother's interests, and he made his fortune in iron and steel because of Andrew.  In 1861, Thomas N. Miller, [[Henry Phipps, Jr.|Henry Phipps]] (the son of the shoemaker Margaret Carnegie did home work for), Anthony Kloman, and Andrew Kloman organized the Iron City Forge in Pittsburgh to take advantage of the booming need for iron products during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, 1903, pp. 5&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Derbyshire, 2008, pp. 77&amp;ndash;78.&lt;/ref&gt;  Miller subsequently bought out Anton Kloman's share.&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, 1903, pp. 10&amp;ndash;11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Derb78"&gt;Derbyshire, 2008, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nasaw87"&gt;Nasaw, 2006, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Phipps and Miller later learned that Andrew Kloman had sold a one-ninth share in the business to a local man who subsequently died during the war, and Miller bought his share (raising his ownership in the business to four-ninths).&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Kloman, Miller, and Phipps were soon at odds over these transactions and one another's refusal to sell out to the others, and they sought Andrew Carnegie's assistance in resolving the dispute.&lt;ref name="Derb78" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nasaw87" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 1, 1863, Carnegie drew up new incorporation papers which made Miller a "special partner" in the firm and which also made Thomas Carnegie a partner in the business.&lt;ref name="Derb78" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nasaw87" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;  The money for Thomas' investment came from Andrew.&lt;ref name="Bridge17"&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  A clause in the contract permitted Kloman and Phipps to oust Miller and make him a silent partner, which they quickly did.&lt;ref name="Derb78" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nasaw87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bridge17" /&gt;  The same clause, however, gave Thomas Carnegie the right to purchase the extra one-ninth share Miller had obtained, and Andrew Carnegie immediately financed this purchase.&lt;ref name="Derb78" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nasaw87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bridge17" /&gt;  When Miller, one of Andrew's closest friends, protested, Andrew induced Thomas to plead with him to acquiesce lest Andrew's reputation as a fair dealer suffer.&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller did so.

[[File:Thomas M Carnegie - 1862.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Thomas Carnegie at age 19.]]
Meanwhile, Miller established a rival firm, the Cyclops Iron Company, with Andrew Carnegie as an investor.&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 21; Derbyshire, 2008, pp. 78&amp;ndash;79.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cyclops firm opened in October 1864.  Thomas, however, was deeply concerned that the Cyclops company would harm his own interests in Iron City Forge, and successfully prevailed on Andrew to merge the two firms.&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 21-23.&lt;/ref&gt; (It may also be true that Andrew always intended to merge the two firms in order to gain control of both, and used Thomas for this purpose.)&lt;ref name="nasaw88"&gt;Nasaw, 2006, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kloman and Phipps at first refused, but Thomas made an offer of all the shares in Cyclops plus an additional payment of $50,000 (a very large sum at the time).&lt;ref name="Bridge23"&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 1, 1865, the new Union Iron Mills Company was formed.&lt;ref name="Bridge23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Derb79"&gt;Derbyshire, 2008, pp. 78&amp;ndash;79.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas was to "help out" as needed, and appointed vice president of the firm.&lt;ref name="nasaw88" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Derb79" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Andrew and Miller spent the better part of the next year touring Europe, Thomas flourished at the Union Iron Mills. The company struggled financially as the end of the Civil War led to sharp drops in the need for iron products, but Thomas proved to be a warm and friendly executive where his brother was cold and austere.&lt;ref name="Bridge26"&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas' ability to make friends allowed the firm to receive numerous contracts and even infusions of capital when needed, and it is unlikely the company would have survived without him.&lt;ref name="Bridge26" /&gt; Andrew wrote to Thomas extensively from Europe, constantly criticizing his business decisions, providing him with [[Micromanagement|micromanaging]] instructions, and generally demeaning him.&lt;ref name="tedl3334" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Derb79" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dilsaver37"&gt;Dilsaver, 2004, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, 2006, pp. 95&amp;ndash;98.&lt;/ref&gt;  From Europe, Andrew also badgered Thomas to make improvements to their home in America, and decided to call the rapidly expanding mansion "Fairfield."&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, 2006, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; But Thomas' judgment could prove wiser than Andrew's. In July 1865, Andrew became fascinated with the "Dodd process," a new English method of welding steel facing to iron railroad rails and, despite Thomas' misgivings, he purchased the American patent for the process.&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, 2006, p. 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt;  But the process proved unworkable, and despite additional investments and retooling of the mill additional rails proved just as brittle and breakable as the first.&lt;ref name="nasaw100102"&gt;Nasaw, 2006, pp. 100&amp;ndash;102.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas advised him to conserve his money, but Andrew purchased yet another steel welding patent to try to fix the process.&lt;ref name="nasaw100102" /&gt;  That, too, failed and soon Carnegie's steel-welding business was bankrupt.&lt;ref name="nasaw100102" /&gt;  Thomas correctly foresaw that Andrew too easily believed his judgment was infallible, and soon a coal mining process Andrew had purchased also led to significant financial losses.&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, 2006, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Thomas began courting Lucy Coleman, daughter of Pittsburgh iron manufacturing magnate William Coleman.&lt;ref name="Bridge27"&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Coleman provided Thomas with critical advice on how to improve the Union Iron Mills, and inside information on the coming railroad building boom.&lt;ref name="Bridge27" /&gt;  Another critical business relationship was with Piper &amp; Shiffler (later known as the [[Keystone Bridge Company]]), an iron bridge building firm invested in by Andrew in 1862.&lt;ref name="Derb77"&gt;Derbyshire, 2008, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;  Andrew diverted much of Piper &amp; Shiffler's contracts to the Union Iron Mills, further bolstering the company's profits.&lt;ref name="Bridge27" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, 2006, pp. 102&amp;ndash;103.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas often tried to rein in some of his brother's excesses, but to no avail.  For example, in 1866 Andrew proposed purchasing a pipe works adjacent to the old Cyclops Iron Works.  Thomas opposed the purchase, arguing that the time for expansion was not ripe and that the pipe works used a kind of iron which the Union Iron Mills did not produce.&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, 1903, pp. 28&amp;ndash;29.&lt;/ref&gt;  The pipe works turned out to be a [[white elephant]], but they burned down shortly thereafter (saving the firm from further losses).&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Lucy Furnace and Thomson Works===
Thomas Carnegie played a critical role in the expansion of the Carnegie Bros. &amp; Co. company into the production of [[pig iron]]. Iron ore was usually smelted into pig iron first, a brittle but refined product (often cast in [[ingot]]s) which was usually sold to other companies and turned into [[wrought iron]] or steel. Several investors in the Union Iron Mills wished to invest in companies producing pig iron, but William Coleman advised against it and advocated building a wholly owned modern furnace under the company's control.&lt;ref name="Bridge55"&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; A division of the Union Iron Mills (named the Isabella Furnace Company) was organized on December 1, 1870, and the company's first [[blast furnace]] (named the "Lucy furnace" after Thomas' wife) was constructed on 51st Street in Pittsburgh.&lt;ref name="Bridge55" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Standiford, 2005, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the investors who joined the Isabella Furnace Company were Thomas' friends, not Andrew's.&lt;ref&gt;Skrabec, 2010, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Carnegie supervised the operation of the Lucy furnace,&lt;ref name="Bridge69"&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was almost alone in contributing to its business success.&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, 2006, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lucy furnace was enormous—{{convert|75|ft|m}} high with a {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} bosh (the widest part of the furnace and the hottest due to its proximity to the hearth)—and was producing a record-shattering {{convert|300|ST|t}} a day by 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 54, 58.&lt;/ref&gt; A second Lucy furnace was built in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881, a two-thirds share in the company was sold to Wilson, Walker &amp; Co. and James R. Wilson relieved Thomas Carnegie and John Phipps of their duties overseeing the operation of the furnaces.&lt;ref name="Bridge69" /&gt;

Thomas Carnegie's experience in running the Lucy furnaces led him to co-found the Edgar Thomson Steel Works. In early 1871, William Coleman became interested in the new [[Bessemer process]] steel-making furnaces, and he traveled throughout Ohio, New York, and Pennsylvania to view these new works.&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 72-73; Nasaw, 2006, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Coleman invited Thomas Carnegie to join him in building the new steel works, and together they purchased {{convert|107|acre|ha}} of land about {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of Pittsburgh known as [[Braddock's Field]] (a historic battlefield where French and Indian forces from [[Fort Duquesne]] defeated British General [[Edward Braddock]] on July 5, 1755, in the [[Battle of the Monongahela]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 73; Seabrook, 2004, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; (Thomas borrowed the money for his investment from his brother.)&lt;ref&gt;Skrabec, 2010, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Coleman and Carnegie lived near one another in Homewood and went to work together on the streetcar, and it was during these daily commutes that the men worked on their plans for the new steel works.&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 73-74; Skrabec, 2010, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Thomas asked Andrew to invest in the new mill, Andrew refused (considering it too risky a venture).&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas then prevailed upon David McCandless, a wealthy Pittsburgh merchant and vice president of the Exchange National Bank.&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt; McCandless agreed, and brought in William P. Shinn (a [[Norman Medal]]-winning engineer) as treasurer.&lt;ref name="Bridge75"&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1872, Andrew Carnegie (while on a [[Bond (finance)|bond]]-selling trip) made a survey of Bessemer steel works in Europe and returned to the U.S. highly enthusiastic about the new project.&lt;ref name="Bridge75" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Derb83"&gt;Derbyshire, 2008, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew subsequently invested $250,000 in the works.&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 75-76.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Coleman, McCandless, Scott, and Thomas Carnegie had purchased a newly [[plat]]ted tract in Pittsburgh, [[Subdivision (land)|subdivided]] it, and sold the lots at a significant profit.&lt;ref name="Bridge76"&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The partners then invested $50,000 each in the steel mill.&lt;ref name="Bridge76" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, 2006, p. 143; Seabrook, 2004, pp. 102&amp;ndash;103.&lt;/ref&gt; A new company, Carnegie, McCandless &amp; Co., was formed on January 13, 1873, to build the works.&lt;ref name="Bridge76" /&gt;

Thomas was on vacation with Andrew and their mother at the upscale resort town of [[Cresson, Pennsylvania|Cresson Springs]] in September 1873 when they learned of the failure of the investment bank of [[Jay Cooke &amp; Company]], which precipitated the [[Panic of 1873]].&lt;ref name="Derb83" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, 2006, p. 150-151.&lt;/ref&gt; The Panic created financial difficulties for the company, and it floated bonds to stay alive. [[John Edgar Thomson|J. Edgar Thomson]], president of the Pennsylvania Railroad and a mentor and close friend to many of the partners, bought many of these bonds in late 1873, helping keep the firm afloat.&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The partners dissolved Carnegie, McCandless &amp; Co. to take advantage of a new Pennsylvania law permitting the formation of [[Limited liability company|limited liability companies]], and the Edgar Thomson Steel Company Ltd. was created on October 12, 1874.&lt;ref name="Bridge76" /&gt; The company took its name from J. Edgar Thomson, who although not a large investor in the works had a superb reputation as an honest and trustworthy person (an important asset in risky financial times).&lt;ref&gt;Standiford, 2005, p. 45; Nasaw, 2006, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next several years, Thomas Carnegie generally oversaw the Edgar Thomson Steel Company. His success in this endeavor was summed up by a corporate historian this way:&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 111 (misspellings in original).&lt;/ref&gt;
:Mr. T.M. Carnegie's abilities were too numerous and complex to be summed up in a sentence. He was a man of sterling integrity; and it was a common saying in Pittsburg that his word was better than some men's bond. He had remarkable judgment; and his opinion on commercial questions was valued above that of much older and more experienced men. Quick and keen in his perceptions, cautious but progressive in his ideas, faithful to his engagements, and just in all his dealings, he gave to his company that which corporations are habitually lacking, namely, a conscience.
Other historical assessments conclude Thomas had a solid grasp of the steel business and was a respected manager, even if Andrew considered him overly cautious.&lt;ref&gt;Standiford, 2005, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; William Abbott, chairman of Carnegie, Phipps, &amp; Co., considered Thomas the better businessman than Andrew, "solid, shrewd, farseeing, absolutely honest and dependable."&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, 2006, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas lacked Andrew's ambition, but "was content with a good, prosperous, safe business and cared nothing for expansion. He disapproved of Andrew's skyrocketing tendencies, regarded him as a plunger and a dangerous leader. Tom wanted earnings in the shape of dividends, whereas Andrew insisted on using them for expansion."&lt;ref name="nasaw139" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bullard180" /&gt; Although he shied away from publicity, he was a hard worker and well liked by both management and workers.&lt;ref name="nasaw139" /&gt; His one flaw was his drinking: He often left work at noon and drank heavily for the rest of the day.&lt;ref name="nasaw139" /&gt;

[[Crony capitalism]] was an important part of American industrialism during this period. Thomas Carnegie, however, was not very adept at it. There is conflicting evidence as to whether he mixed widely in Pittsburgh society, with at least one scholar claiming he did&lt;ref name="Skrab70"&gt;Skrabec, 2010, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; and another that he did not.&lt;ref name="nasaw139" /&gt; He was reserved at social gatherings,&lt;ref name="nasaw139" /&gt; using his attendance at parties to pick up business gossip and industry buzz.&lt;ref name="Skrab70" /&gt; He played cards on a weekly basis with [[Henry Clay Frick]], [[Philander Knox]], Andrew and [[Richard B. Mellon|Richard Mellon]], and [[George Westinghouse]].&lt;ref&gt;Skrabec, 2010, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; His closest friend was David A. Stewart, a co-partner in the Thomson works, and Stewart readily defended Thomas against the criticisms and jibes of others (particularly Andrew Carnegie).&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas sold half his interest in Edgar Thomson Steel to his older brother in 1876 after disagreement broke out over whether to build another "Lucy furnace."&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Carnegie, however, held no position on the Thomson board of directors, a situation Andrew Carnegie wanted rectified the moment a position on the board became available. This occurred in the summer of 1876, but William P. Shinn (the second-largest stockholder in the company) complained bitterly to Andrew (traveling in Europe) that the seat should have gone to him.&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Thomas was not only added to the board but made chairman upon Andrew Carnegie's return to the U.S. a few months later.&lt;ref name="Bridge124"&gt;Bridge, 1903, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Standiford, 2005, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Shinn eventually had enough, and resigned as manager of the Thomson steel works in September 1879.&lt;ref name="Bridge124" /&gt; Thomas replaced Shinn as manager.&lt;ref&gt;Derbyshire, 2008, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Carnegie decided to stop relying solely on his company's own furnaces for [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], and began seeking to buy the fuel on the open market. Thomas and Henry Phipps had alerted Andrew to the need for a greater and steadier supply for coke for the growing steel works.&lt;ref name="nasaw209" /&gt; In 1881, Andrew sent Thomas to meet with [[Henry Clay Frick]], owner of H.C. Frick &amp; Co.—the largest coke producing company in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Stand52"&gt;Standiford, 2005, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas' goal was to induce Frick to buy the Carnegie coke ovens.&lt;ref name="Stand52" /&gt; In November 1881, Thomas proposed selling the Monastery Coke Works near [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania]], to Frick, or at least have Frick take over the marketing and selling of the coke produced there.&lt;ref&gt;Standiford, 2005, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas' offer came as Frick was planning his wedding, and it fell to Andrew to meet with Frick and his new bride as they honeymooned in New York City.&lt;ref name="Stand5859"&gt;Standiford, 2005, p. 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Thomas had negotiated most of an agreement with Frick, as well as planned the meeting with Andrew.&lt;ref&gt;Skrabec, 2010, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie took a 10 percent interest in H.C. Frick &amp; Co., Frick took a 50 percent interest in the Monastery coke works, and H.C. Frick &amp; Co. would become the exclusive supplier of coke to Carnegie Bros. &amp; Co. and the Edgar Thomson Steel Works.&lt;ref name="Stand5859" /&gt; Thomas was assigned to negotiate the price of coke on an annual basis with Frick, and over the next two years H.C. Frick &amp; Co. made a 23 percent profit on the coke sold.&lt;ref&gt;Standiford, 2005, p. 59; Skrabec, 2010, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1885, Andrew Carnegie had purchased enough stock in H.C. Frick &amp; Co. to own 50 percent of the company.&lt;ref&gt;Standiford, 2005, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Frick now attempted to buy into the Carnegie steel companies by selling 12 of the remaining 16 percent of the H.C. Frick which he still owned, but Thomas warned him not to try and to instead seek a position as a manager within the company.&lt;ref&gt;Standiford, 2005, p. 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas also played a key role in the consolidation of Andrew's businesses. Thomas had become more involved with the management of Edgar Thomson Steel and less with the Isabella Furnace and Union Iron companies.&lt;ref name="nasaw209"&gt;Nasaw, 2006, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Thomas who suggested to Andrew that the companies be consolidated into a single firm, and that Thomas' stake in the new firm be raised commensurate with his managerial role.&lt;ref name="nasaw209" /&gt; His older brother agreed. On April 1, 1888, Andrew Carnegie reorganized his iron and steel businesses into one company, Carnegie Bros. &amp; Co., with Thomas holding 17 percent of the stock.&lt;ref&gt;Derbyshire, 2008, p. 89; Skrabec, 2010, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Included in the reorganization were the Lucy and Isabella furnaces, Union Iron Mills, and Homestead works.&lt;ref name="Bridge69" /&gt;

===Dungeness===
[[File:Dungeness HABS.jpg|thumb|Dungeness in 1858, after extensive renovation]]
In 1880, with seven children at Fairfield and the city of Pittsburgh becoming increasingly hazardous to health due to its burgeoning industry, Thomas and Lucy began seeking a summer home along the southern [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] for their family.&lt;ref name="Bullard181"&gt;Bullard, 2005, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; The previous year, the Carnegies had met reporter Frederick Ober while on vacation in [[Fernandina Beach, Florida]].&lt;ref name="Bullard181" /&gt; Ober told them about an island [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] he was writing an article about. In 1880, ''[[Lippincott's Monthly Magazine]]'' published an article by Ober about [[Dungeness (Cumberland Island, Georgia)|Dungeness]], a plantation on the [[barrier island]] of [[Cumberland Island]] on the southern [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name="Bullard181" /&gt; Although it had suffered an extensive fire in 1866 and was uninhabitable, the mansion had a storied past. The article drew the attention of Lucy Carnegie (who had attended boarding school as a girl in nearby Fernandina), and the Carnegies decided the place would be an ideal summer home.&lt;ref name="Bullard181" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dilsaver38"&gt;Dilsaver, 2004, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seabrook, 2004, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The mansion's owner was ex-[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] General William George MacKay Davis, a [[first cousin]] of [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] who bought the plantation from its creditors in 1879.&lt;ref name="Bullard182"&gt;Bullard, 2005, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie offered to buy Dungeness on August 25, 1880, for $25,000 but his offer was rejected.&lt;ref name="Bullard182" /&gt; But after the death of Gen. Davis' son and grandson at the property, Davis desired to leave the place which had brought him such grief and Carnegie offered and Davis accepted a price of $35,000.&lt;ref name="Dilsaver38" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bullard, 2005, p. 183-184.&lt;/ref&gt; The sale for the {{convert|4000|acre|ha|adj=on}} property (which included orange and olive groves, gardens, several cottages, and outbuildings) was final on November 17, 1881.&lt;ref name="Bullard185"&gt;Bullard, 2005, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barefoot, 2004, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next four months, the burned-out mansion was demolished and noted Pittsburgh architect [[Andrew Peebles]] designed a massive [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne Style]] mansion with wraparound [[veranda]]s, high ceilings, several porches, many [[turret]]s, and a {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} high tower.&lt;ref name="Bullard185" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bare34"&gt;Barefoot, 2004, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1882, Carnegie and his cousin, Leander Morris, jointly purchased an adjoining {{convert|8240|acre|ha|adj=on}} property.&lt;ref name="Dilsaver38" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bullard186"&gt;Bullard, 2005, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; The cornerstone for the new Dungeness was laid on February 26, 1884, and the $285,000, {{convert|6720|sqft|m2|adj=on}} mansion (fully furnished) completed on January 1, 1885.&lt;ref name="bare34" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bullard, 2005, p. 186-187.&lt;/ref&gt; There was even a landing for Thomas Carnegie's steam-powered yacht, the ''Missoe''.&lt;ref&gt;Bullard, 2005, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; The Carnegies visited Dungeness irregularly over the next year, traveling to Georgia in a private railroad car.&lt;ref name="Bullard189" /&gt;

With the purchase of his Cumberland Island estate, Thomas resolved to retire from business and spend more time in Georgia.&lt;ref name="Dilsaver38" /&gt; The stress of working for his brother had left him exhausted.&lt;ref name="Dilsaver38" /&gt;

===Social life===
Both Andrew and Thomas Carnegie had been members of the [[South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club]], a highly exclusive wealthy businessman's club which operated a mountaintop retreat overlooking [[Lake Conemaugh]], one of the largest man-made lakes of the day. Lake Conemaugh was formed by the construction of the [[South Fork Dam]] in 1853, but had been drained and abandoned prior to its purchase by the South Fork organization. The club, which formed in 1879, maintained the South Fork Dam and refilled the reservoir. Andrew and Thomas built a cottage near the clubhouse, and often stayed there.&lt;ref&gt;Skrabec, 2010, p. 112; Nasaw, 2006, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; The South Fork Dam failed on May 31, 1889, resulting in the disastrous [[Johnstown Flood]].

==Personal life==

The children were tutored at home, although they also attended a private school for a portion of the day.&lt;ref name="Bullard189"&gt;Bullard, 2005, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867, Andrew moved to New York City, giving "Fairfield" to Thomas, Lucy, and his mother Margaret.&lt;ref name="Dilsaver37" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Derbyshire, 2008, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret moved to New York City to live with her older son in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, 2006, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late September 1886, Thomas Carnegie fell ill with what he believed to be a cold.&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, 2006, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; He was sick off and on for the next several weeks. On October 16, he left work thinking he was suffering from yet another cold, but died of [[pneumonia]] just three days later.&lt;ref name="Derb92" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nasaw285"&gt;Nasaw, 2006, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife and all of his children except Margaret (who was attending a [[boarding school]] in [[New York City|New York]]) were at his bedside when he died.&lt;ref name="Seabrook104" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bullard190"&gt;Bullard, 2005, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; For most of his life, Thomas had been a member of the [[The New Church|Swedenborgian Church]].&lt;ref name="Bridge75" /&gt; His funeral, however, was conducted by an Episcopalian, and Carnegie was buried on October 21, 1886, in [[Allegheny Cemetery]] in Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1886/10/31/103990266.pdf "Thomas M. Carnegie's Funeral." ''New York Times.'' October 31, 1886.]&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, also quite ill for some time, died on November 10 (never learning of her younger son's death).&lt;ref name="Derb92" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nasaw285" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1886/11/11/103996001.pdf "Mrs. Carnegie Dead," ''New York Times,'' November 11, 1886.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas' death was a serious blow to Andrew Carnegie's financial interests. Thomas had run most of Andrew's enterprises, and to fill his role Andrew Carnegie turned to Henry Clay Frick as his replacement.&lt;ref&gt;Skrabec, 2010, pp. 107&amp;ndash;108.&lt;/ref&gt;  Frick later played a critical role in the [[Homestead Strike]] and in brokering the deal between Carnegie and [[J. P. Morgan]] that created [[U.S. Steel]].

===Estate===
Thomas' will named Lucy his sole [[Executor|executrix]] and [[legatee]].&lt;ref name="Bullard190" /&gt; The will asked (but did not require) her to seek the advice of her brother-in-law Andrew and her father (deceased in 1878) in disposing of Thomas' business interests.&lt;ref name="Bullard190" /&gt; Although Andrew advised her to sell out to him, she refused and retained ownership in businesses which led to rapid rises in her personal wealth over the next several decades.&lt;ref&gt;Bullard, 2005, pp. 190&amp;ndash;191.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trade finance''' signifies financing for trade, and it concerns both domestic and international trade transactions. A trade transaction requires a seller of goods and services as well as a buyer. Various intermediaries such as [[bank]]s and [[financial institutions]] can facilitate these transactions by financing the trade.

==Description==
While a seller (or [[exporter]]) can require the purchaser (an [[importer]]) to prepay for goods [[shipping|shipped]], the purchaser (importer) may wish to reduce risk by requiring the seller to document the goods that have been shipped. [[Bank]]s may assist by providing various forms of support. For example, the importer's bank may provide a [[letter of credit]] to the exporter (or the exporter's bank) providing for payment upon presentation of certain documents, such as a [[bill of lading]]. The exporter's bank may make a loan (by advancing funds) to the exporter on the basis of the export contract.

Other forms of trade finance can include [[Documentary Collection]], Trade Credit Insurance, Finetrading, [[Factoring (finance)|Factoring]] or [[Forfaiting]]. Some forms are specifically designed to supplement traditional financing.

Secure trade finance depends on verifiable and secure tracking of physical risks and events in the chain between exporter and importer. The advent of new information and communication technologies allows the development of risk mitigation models which have developed into advance finance models. This allows very low risk of advance payment given to the Exporter, while preserving the Importer's normal payment credit terms and without burdening the importer's [[balance sheet]]. As trade transactions become more flexible and increase in volume, demand for these technologies has grown.

==Products and services==
Banks and financial institutions offer the following products and services in their trade finance branches.

* [[Letter of credit]]: It is an undertaking/promise given by a Bank/Financial Institute on behalf of the Buyer/Importer to the Seller/Exporter, that, if the Seller/Exporter presents the complying documents to the Buyer's designated Bank/Financial Institute as specified by the Buyer/Importer in the Purchase Agreement then the Buyer's Bank/Financial Institute will make payment to the Seller/Exporter.
* [[Bank guarantee]]: It is an undertaking/promise given by a Bank on behalf of the Applicant and in favour of the Beneficiary. Whereas, the Bank has agreed and undertakes that, if the Applicant failed to fulfill his obligations either Financial or Performance as per the Agreement made between the Applicant and the Beneficiary, then the Guarantor Bank on behalf of the Applicant will make payment of the guarantee amount to the Beneficiary upon receipt of a demand or claim from the Beneficiary.'''
Bank guarantee has various types like
1. Tender Bond
2. Advance Payment
3. Performance Bond
4. Financial
5. Retention
6. Labour
7. ready for basic analysis
* [[Export]]
* [[Import]]
* Collection and discounting of bills: It is a major trade service offered by the Banks. The Seller's Bank collects the payment proceeds on behalf of the Seller, from the Buyer or Buyer's Bank, for the goods sold by the Seller to the Buyer as per the agreement made between the Seller and the Buyer.

Supply Chain intermediaries have expanded in recent years to offer importers a funded transaction of individual trades from foreign supplier to importers warehouse or customers designated point of receipt. The Supply Chain products offer importers a funded transaction based on customer order book.

==Methods of payment==
Popular methods of [[payment]] used in [[international trade]] include:

'''cash with order(CWO)'''-the buyers pay [[cash]] when he places an order.

'''cash on delivery(COD)'''-the buyer pays cash when the goods are delivered.

'''documentary credit(L/C)'''-a [[Letter of credit]] (L/C) is used; gives the seller two guarantees that the payment will be made by the buyer:one guarantee from the buyer's [[bank]] and another from the seller's bank.

'''bills for collection(B/E or D/C)''' -here a [[Bill of exchange|Bill of Exchange]] (B/E)is used; or documentary collection (D/C) is a transaction whereby the exporter entrusts the collection of the payment for a sale to its bank (remitting bank), which sends the documents that its buyer needs to the importer’s bank (collecting bank), with instructions to release the documents to the buyer for payment.

'''open account'''-this method can be used by [[business partner]]s who trust each other; the two partners need to have their accounts with the banks that are [[correspondent bank]]s.

== Early life ==

Vijay Eswaran was born in [[Penang]] on 7 October 1960 to Pushpavathy Chinnaiah&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vijayaratnam.org.my/about-us/board-of-governance/|title=Board of Governance – Vijayaratnam Foundation|website=www.vijayaratnam.org.my|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a teacher and Vijayaratnam Saravanamuthu, founder of the Malaysian Hindu Youth Organisation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2011/10/26/father-of-malaysian-hindu-youth-dies/|title=Father of Malaysian Hindu Youth dies - Nation {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was with the Malaysian Ministry of Labour{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. Vijayaratnam's work with the Labour Ministry had the family moving to different parts of Malaysia during Vijay Eswaran's childhood.

Vijay Eswaran financed his tertiary education, which he did in the UK, by working as a cab driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://simplecast.com/s/0a36e848|title=Secret Leaders {{!}} S02E14 Vijay Eswaran: From Taxi Driver to Billionaire {{!}}  Season 2 {{!}}  Episode 14|website=Secret Leaders|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating with a degree in socio-economics from LSE ([[London School of Economics]]) in 1984, he traveled around Europe for a year, where he did a series of odd jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/vijayeswaran/docs/business-today---cover-story|title=Breaking the Silence - Business Today  (Cover Story)|work=Issuu|access-date=2018-01-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his travels he spent over a month in a Franciscan monastery, where he took a 33-day vow of silence. This experience stands at the core of his first book, In the Sphere of Silence. In 1985 he returned to the UK where he learned about binary system marketing, and obtained professional qualification from [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants|CIMA]] (Chartered Institute of Management Accountants). In 1986 he traveled to the US where he obtained an [[MBA]] from the [[Southern Illinois University]] in 1986. At this time he was involved in [[multilevel marketing]] (MLM) on a part-time basis while working for Systematics, a subsidiary of IBM.

It wasn't until his return to Malaysia - 13 years after leaving it - where he was approached by the Cosway Group to start its Philippines business, that he began looking at MLM more seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://issuu.com/vijayeswaran/docs/business-today---cover-story|title=Datuk Vijay Eswaran sets the record straight|last=Vincent|first=Anne|date=October 2009|work=Business Today|accessdate=17 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|issue=issue 10|location=Malaysia|volume=vol 9|pages=22–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vijay Eswaran, his business partner Joseph Bismark, Tagumpay Kintanar and Donna Marie Imson were accused in Jakarta on May 3 of allegedly defrauding two Filipinos of more $100,000 in Goldquest pyramiding scheme after arrest warrants were issued by Judge Vargas. They were charged before the Quezon City Regional Trial Court of syndicated estafa which was a non-bailable offence on the basis of a criminal complaint. The Department of Justice, Office of the City Prosecutor later dropped the charges following a Jakarata courts dismissal of the extradition request from the National Bureau of Investigation and citing it to be a civil liability and not a criminal case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/content/53782/goldquest-execs-seek-relief-from-supreme-court/story/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/content/58067/doj-drops-estafa-case-vs-goldquest-executives/story/]&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2007 The International Herald Tribune reported his arrest on an [[Interpol]] warrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Report: Indonesian ex-president helps catch Malaysian businessman in fraud case |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/05/07/asia/AS-GEN-Malaysia-Indonesia-Fraud.php  |work=International Herald Tribune |date=7 May 2007 |accessdate=28 March 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070512152016/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/05/07/asia/AS-GEN-Malaysia-Indonesia-Fraud.php |archivedate = 12 May 2007}} (Sourced from the Wayback Machine.)&lt;/ref&gt; A dispute in [[Manila]], Philippines filed by two former partners of the original founding team was escalated to an alleged ‘offence’ leading to an Interpol Red alert listing of four directors.

'''''Water Park Tycoon''''' is a sandbox [[video game]] where the player's goal is to create a successful water park. It was developed and published by [[Excalibur Publishing]] Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/water-park-tycoon|title=Water Park Tycoon|website=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/water-park-tycoon/|title=Water Park Tycoon|website=GameSpot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==

[[File:Water Park Tycoon Gameplay.png|left|thumb|350px|A screenshot of the gameplay of Water Park Tycoon, showing many of the core game features.]]
The goal of the game is to build a successful [[water park]]. When a world is launched, there is a large fenced-in space where the player can build their water park, as well as a ticket booth. The park is closed when by default, but the player can open it at anytime, which will cause guests to be able to enter the park. Several types of [[Swimming pool|pools]], [[water slides]], playground rides, food stalls, and [[vegetation]] are available for the player to improve the park. When any of these are bought, the player will lose money. Money is gained when guests buy food or drink, or purchase a park ticket. The player can set the price of both of these, but if the price is too high, guests will not want to purchase an article or ticket, and the park rating will drop.

The park rating is represented by a star with a number in it as well as a percentage on the top right of the screen. The percentage and number start off at 0, but as the water park is expanded and improved, the percentage will go up, causing the number to come up too. Once the percentage gets to 90%, the number will be up to 5, which is the highest it can go. In addition to building attractions and stalls, the player can also hire [[staff of office|staff]]. These staff will perform tasks such as cleaning up the park, improving safety, and watering plants. Staff help improve the park greatly, and will therefore increase the park rating. However, the more staff you hire, the more money you lose at the end of an in-game month.

'''Wim Mager''' (26 September 1940 in [[Rotterdam]] – 23 March 2008 in [[Silvolde]]) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] photographer who is mainly known for founding the [[Apenheul Primate Park]] near [[Apeldoorn]] of which he was the director until 1997. When he had found a successor he moved to [[France]] and started a similar primate park near [[Poitiers]] called [[La Vallée des Singes]].

Apenheul was the result of an out of control hobby. Mager had two small monkeys as a pet but when the pair got children one thing led to another. His ideal was starting a primate park where the primates would not be kept in cages but could walk free among the people. Apenheul was the first park of its kind in the world. Bert de Boer, the later director of Apenheul called him a "pionier of the zoo world".

Mager died on the first Easter day in 2008 at 67 years of age after having been ill for some time. He twice had a [[stroke]], the last heavy one a week before his death.

'''Zaatar w Zeit''' ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;زعتر وزيت&lt;/big&gt;}}), a commercial brand of the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] company '''Breakfast &amp; Co. S.A.L.''', is an urban eatery franchise founded in Lebanon in 1999&lt;ref name=sharqawsat&gt;[http://www.aawsat.com/details.asp?section=62&amp;article=488685&amp;issueno=10897#.UuAl_9L8W70 ''[[Asharq Al-Awsat]]'', London: «زعتر وزيت».. وأصبح للمنقوشة بيتها - أبسط المكونات تتحول إلى سلسلة مطاعم] {{ar icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and operating with 20 outlets in Lebanon and more than 70 outlets throughout the [[Middle East]], including 20 in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. The company also has outlets in [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Qatar]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].

The name Zaatar W Zeit (stylized as '''zaatar &lt;small&gt;w&lt;/small&gt; zeit''') refers to [[thyme]] or ''[[za'atar]]'' in Arabic, a common Middle Eastern herb in Arabic cuisine used notably in preparation of [[manakish|za'atar manakish]] and other recipes, and ''zeit'' (Arabic for [[olive oil]] in this context). The franchise has since introduced a far more varied menu than just za'atar-based products.
