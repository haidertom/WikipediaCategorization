There are several types of agitation machines, including washing machine agitators (which rotate back and forth) and magnetic agitators (which contain a magnetic bar rotating in a magnetic field).{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Agitators can come in many sizes and varieties, depending on the application.

In general, agitators usually consist of an impeller and a shaft. An impeller is a rotor located within a tube or conduit attached to the shaft. It helps enhance the pressure in order for the flow of a fluid be done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dein-hochdruckreiniger.de/|title=Pressure Washer|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern industrial agitators incorporate process control to maintain better control over the mixing process.

==Washing machine agitator==

[[Image:Washing machine agitator.JPG|thumb|Agitator for a laundromat washing machine.]]

In a top load [[washing machine]] the agitator projects from the bottom of the wash basket and creates the wash action by rotating back and forth, rolling garments from the top of the load, down to the bottom, then back up again.

There are several types of agitators with the most common being the "straight-vane" and "dual-action" agitators. The "straight-vane" is a one-part agitator with bottom and side fins that usually turns back and forth. The Dual-action is a two-part agitator that has bottom washer fins that move back and forth and a spiral top that rotates clockwise to help guide the clothes to the bottom washer fins.

The modern agitator, which is dual-action, was first made in [[Kenmore Appliances]] washing machines in the 1980s to present. These agitators are known by the company as dual-rollover and triple-rollover action agitators.

==Magnetic agitator==

{{Main|Magnetic stirrer}}

This is a device formed by a metallic bar (called the agitation bar) which is normally covered by a plastic layer, and a sheet that has underneath it a rotatory [[magnet]] or a series of [[electromagnet]]s arranged in a circular form to create a [[Rotating magnetic field|magnetic rotatory field]]. Commonly, the sheet has an arrangement of electric resistances that can heat some chemical solutions.

During the operation of a typical magnetic agitator, the agitator bar is moved inside a container such as to dissolve a substance in a liquid. The container must be placed on the sheet, so that the magnetic field influences the agitation bar and makes it rotate. This allows it to mix different substances at high speeds.

In [[computer-generated imagery]] and real-time [[3D computer graphics]], '''antiportal rendering''' is a way to reduce overdraw (the rendering of detail which will not be in the final image), and in this way to optimize draw speed. Antiportals are related to [[portal (computer graphics)|portal]]s, and are the inverse.

An antiportal (or occluder) works by defining a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] or [[volume]] which can ''never'' be seen through, normally by placing it within an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] object. The [[Rendering (computer graphics)|renderer]] uses this to quickly calculate which objects/faces/vertices lie behind the antiportal, and so are out of line of sight, so do not need to be rendered.&lt;ref name="byrne"&gt;{{cite book |title=Game Level Design |last=Byrne |first=Edward |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Cengage Learning |location= |isbn= 1-58450-369-6 |page=231 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[video game]]s and 3D graphics programs use this technique for speed rendering. ''[[Unreal Tournament 2004]]'', among many other games, uses this technique.&lt;ref name="byrne" /&gt;

[[File:Barometer Goethe 04.jpg|thumb|right|A ''storm glass'' or ''Goethe's device'', an early practical type of barometer. Calandra's essay does not name the ''type'' of the device, although the answers provided by the student suggest the use of a portable [[Barometer#Aneroid barometers|aneroid barometer]].]]

The '''barometer question''' is an example of an incorrectly designed examination question demonstrating [[functional fixedness]] that causes a moral [[dilemma]] for the examiner. In its classic form, popularized by American [[Test (assessment)#Test preparations|test designer]] professor [[Alexander Calandra]] (1911–2006), the question asked the student to "show how it is possible to determine the height of a tall building with the aid of a [[barometer]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1968dec21-00060?View=PDF&lt;/ref&gt; The examiner was confident that there was one, and only one, correct answer, which is by calculating the difference in pressure at the top and bottom of the building. Contrary to the examiner's expectations, the student responded with a series of completely different answers. These answers were also correct, yet none of them proved the student's competence in the specific academic field being tested.

The barometer question achieved the status of an [[urban legend]]; according to an [[internet meme]], the question was asked at the [[University of Copenhagen]] and the student was [[Niels Bohr]].&lt;ref&gt;http://naturelovesmath-en.blogspot.in/2011/06/niels-bohr-barometer-question-myth.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kaplan, Inc.]] [[ACT (test)|ACT]] preparation textbook describes it as an "[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] legend",&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; and an early form is found in a 1958 American humor book.&lt;ref&gt;''Reader's Digest Treasury of Wit &amp;amp; Humor,'' [https://books.google.com/books?ei=CSY9UuTHH8rwkQXboYCgDg&amp;id=P7cNAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=aneroid+barometer p. 303]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Calandra presented the incident as a real-life, [[First-person narrative|first-person]] experience that occurred during the [[Sputnik crisis]].&lt;ref name=C229&gt;Calandra, Alexander, "Angels on a Pin".

== Calandra's account ==
A colleague of Calandra posed the barometer question to a student, expecting the correct answer: "the height of the building can be estimated in proportion to the difference between the barometer readings at the bottom and at the top of the building".&lt;ref&gt;A classic in-depth discussion of the subject was presented in 1823 by [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Rev. Baden Powell]] in ''Measurement of Heights by the Barometer'', published in [https://books.google.com/books?id=gTkwAAAAYAAJ volume 22, numbers I through V], of the ''[[Annals of Philosophy]]''. For a modern presentation of the same subject, see Silverman, pp. 40-48. The particular formula sought by Calandra's examiner is marked with index 2.12 on page 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The student provided a different, and also correct answer: "Take the barometer to the top of the building. Attach a long rope to it, lower the barometer to the street, then bring it up, measuring the length of the rope. The length of the rope is the height of the building."&lt;ref name=C228&gt;Calandra, Alexander, "Angels on a Pin". Reproduced in Barnes et al., pp. 228-229. p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The examiner and Calandra, who was called to advise on the case, faced a moral [[dilemma]]. According to the format of the exam, a correct answer deserved a full credit. But issuing a full credit would have violated [[academic standards]] by rewarding a student who had not demonstrated competence in the academic field that had been tested ([[physics]]). Neither of two available options (pass or fail) was morally acceptable.&lt;ref name=C228/&gt;

Calandra asked the student the same question, and received a wealth of different answers including dropping the barometer from the top of the building and timing its fall with a stopwatch; trading the barometer to the building's superintendent in return for the information wanted; creating two small [[pendulum]]s and measuring the variation of g from the ground to the top of the building; creating a pendulum as high as the building and measuring its period; and comparing the length of the shadows of the building and the barometer. The student admitted that he knew the expected "correct" answer, but was fed up with the professor's "teaching him how to think ... rather than teaching him the structure of the subject."&lt;ref name=C229/&gt;

== Internet meme ==
According to [[Snopes.com]], more recent (1999 and 1988) versions identify the problem as a question in "a physics degree exam at the [[University of Copenhagen]]" and the student as [[Niels Bohr]], and includes the following answers:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/college/exam/barometer.asp snopes.com: The Barometer Problem]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Tying a piece of string to the barometer, lowering the barometer from the roof to the ground, and measuring the length of the string and barometer.
* Dropping the barometer off the roof, measuring the time it takes to hit the ground, and calculating the building's height assuming [[Equations of motion#Constant linear acceleration|constant acceleration under gravity]].
* When the sun is shining, standing the barometer up, measuring the height of the barometer and the lengths of the shadows of both barometer and building, and finding the building's height using [[similar triangles]].
* Tying a piece of string to the barometer, and swinging it like a pendulum both on the ground and on the roof, and from the known pendulum length and swing period, calculate the [[gravitational field]] for the two cases.  Use [[Newton's law of gravitation]] to calculate the radial altitude of both the ground and the roof.  The difference will be the height of the building.
* Tying a piece of string to the barometer, which is as long as the height of the building, and swinging it like a pendulum, and from the swing period, calculate the pendulum length.
* Marking off the number of barometer lengths vertically along the emergency staircase, and multiplying this with the length of the barometer.
* Trading the barometer for the correct information with the building's janitor or superintendent.
* Measuring the pressure difference between ground and roof and calculating the height difference (the expected answer).

== Interpretations ==
Professor of physics Mark Silverman used what he called "The Barometer-Story formula" precisely for explaining the subject of [[pressure]] and recommended it to physics teachers. Silverman called Calandra's story "a delightful essay that I habitually read to my class whenever we study fluids ... the essay is short, hilarious and satisfying (at least to me and my class)."&lt;ref name=S40&gt;Silverman, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial advisor [[Robert G. Allen (author)|Robert G. Allen]] presented Calandra's essay to illustrate the process and role of [[creativity]] in finance. "Creativity is born when you have a problem to solve. And as you can see from this story ["Angels on a Pin"] there are many ways of solving a problem. Creativity is the art of looking for solutions that are out of the ordinary, different, unorthodox."&lt;ref&gt;Allen, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Meara used the barometer question to illustrate the art of steering students' activities to a desired outcome: "if the question is not aligned [with the desired learning outcome] then the problem becomes an exercise of problem solving for its own value."&lt;ref name=M108&gt;O'Meara, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher can steer the students either through careful design of the questions (this rules out ''barometer questions''), or through guiding the students to the desired choices. In case of the original barometer question, the examiner may explicitly say that the problem has more than one solution, insist on applying the laws of physics, or give them the "ending point" of the solution: "How did I discover that the building was 410 feet in height with only a barometer?"&lt;ref name=M108/&gt;

Herson used the Calandra account as an illustration of the difference between academic tests and assessment in education. Tests, even the ones designed for reliability and validity, are useful, but they are not sufficient in real-world education.&lt;ref&gt;Herson, pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanders interpreted Calandra's story as a conflict between perfection and optimal solutions: "We struggle to determine a 'best' answer, when a simple call to a building superintendent (the resource man) would quickly provide adequate information."&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aquatic ecosystems==
Changing the fish population of bodies of water as a part of [[watershed management]] can facilitate desirable changes in [[aquatic ecosystems]] suffering from [[eutrophication]] characterized by domination by [[phytoplankton]] aiding [[ecosystem restoration]], an application of [[restoration ecology]]. In ponds or lakes alternative stable conditions, one with high algae populations, little other plant life, and turbid water, another with low algae populations, a diverse plant population, and clear water, may exist. In addition to prevention of excess nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrates, removal of certain fish species adapted to turbid water may facilitate change from one steady state to the other, an application of [[dynamical systems theory]].&lt;ref name=NYT72012&gt;{{cite news |last=Guterl |first=Fred |title=Searching for Clues to Calamity |date=2012-07-20 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/21/opinion/the-climate-change-tipping-point.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fish species may be removed by means of poison, harvesting, or introduction of predatory species. As a different fish community will result from the process it will affect recreational and commercial fishermen whose cooperation or opposition is important.&lt;ref name=FAO952&gt;{{cite journal|title=Consequences of biomanipulation for fish and fisheries.|journal=FAO Fisheries Circular|year=2001|issue=952|pages=23|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/007/y0814e/y0814e00.pdf|accessdate=July 21, 2011|author=Eddy H.R.R.

Lake Zwemlust, a hypertrophic pond used as a swimming pool in The Netherlands with an area of 1.5 hectares and an average depth of 1.5 meters, was treated in March 1987. The initial [[Secchi disk|Secchi disk transparency]] was only 0.3 meters, less than the 1 meter maximum permitted for swimming pools in The Netherlands. In the first summer Secchi disk transparency increased to at least 2.5 meters, the maximum depth of the lake.&lt;ref name="10.1007/BF02286424"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Donk|first=E. |author2=R. D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12424">'''Cell cycle analysis by DNA content measurement''' is a method that most frequently employs [[flow cytometry]] to distinguish cells in different phases of the [[cell cycle]]. Before analysis, the cells are usually [[wiktionary:Permeabilization|permeabilised]] and treated with a [[fluorescent dye]] that stains [[DNA]] quantitatively, such as [[propidium iodide]] (PI) or 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The fluorescence intensity of the stained cells correlates with the amount of DNA they contain. As the DNA content doubles during the [[S phase]], the DNA content (and thereby intensity of fluorescence) of cells in the [[G0 phase|G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; phase]] and [[G1 phase|G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; phase]] (before S), in the S phase, and in the [[G2 phase|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phase]] and [[M phase]] (after S) identifies the cell cycle phase position in the major phases (G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; versus S versus G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/M phase) of the cell cycle. The cellular DNA content of individual cells is often plotted as their frequency histogram to provide information about relative frequency (percentage) of cells in the major phases of the cell cycle.

Cell cycle anomalies revealed on the DNA content frequency histogram are often observed after different types of cell damage, for example such [[DNA damage]] that interrupts the cell cycle progression at certain [[cell cycle checkpoint|checkpoints]]. Such an arrest of the cell cycle progression can lead either to an effective DNA repair, which may prevent transformation of normal into a cancer cell ([[carcinogenesis]]), or to cell death, often by the mode of [[apoptosis]]. An arrest of cells in G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is often seen as a result of lack of nutrients (growth factors), for example after [[blood serum|serum]] deprivation.
Cell cycle analysis was first described in 1969 at [[Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory]] by a group from the [[University of California]] using the [[Feulgen stain]]ing technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Multiparameter analysis of the cell cycle''' includes, in addition to measurement of cellular DNA content, other cell cycle related constituents/features. The concurrent measurement of cellular DNA and RNA content, or DNA susceptibility to denaturation at low pH using the metachromatic dye [[acridine orange]], reveals the G&lt;sub&gt;1Q&lt;/sub&gt;, G&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;, and G&lt;sub&gt;1B&lt;/sub&gt; cell cycle compartments and also makes it possible to discriminate between S, G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and mitotic cells.&lt;ref&gt;Darzynkiewicz Z, Traganos F, Melamed MR.

Similar cell cycle compartments are also recognized by multiparameter analysis that includes measurement of expression of [[cyclin D1]], [[cyclin E]], [[cyclin A]] and [[cyclin B1]], each in relation to DNA content &lt;ref&gt;Darzynkiewicz Z, Gong JP, Juan G, Ardelt B, Traganos, F.

(1986) Cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry. Int J Radiat Biol Relat Stud Phys Chem Med. Feb;49(2):237-55. {{PMID|3510993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the incorporation of [[5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine]] (EdU), the precursor whose detection offers certain advantages over BrdU, has now become the preferred methodology do detect DNA replicating (S-phase) cells.&lt;ref&gt;Buck SB, Bradford J, Gee KR, Agnew BJ, Clarke ST, Salic A.

==Experimental procedure==

[[File:1D30 DNA DAPI.png|250px|right|thumb|DAPI (magenta) bound to the minor groove of DNA (green and blue). From {{PDB|1D30}}.]] Unless staining is performed using [[Hoechst 33342]], the first step in preparing cells for cell cycle analysis is permeabilisation of the cells' [[plasma membrane]]s. This is usually done by incubating them in a [[buffer solution]] containing a mild [[detergent]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Triton X-100]] or [[NP-40]], or by [[Fixation (histology)|fixating]] them in [[ethanol]]. Most fluorescent DNA dyes (one of exceptions is [[Hoechst 33342]]) are not plasma membrane permeant, that is, unable to pass through an intact cell membrane. Permeabilisation is therefore crucial for the success of the next step, the staining of the cells.

Prior to (or during the staining step) the cells are often treated with [[RNase A]] to remove [[RNA]]s. This is important because 
certain dyes that stain DNA will also stain RNA, thus creating [[Artifact (error)|artefact]]s that would distort the results. An exception is the metachromatic fluorochrome [[acridine orange]],  which under the specific staining protocol can differentially stain both, RNA (generating red luminescence) and DNA (green fluorescence), or in another protocol, after removal of RNA and partial DNA denaturation, to differentially stain double-stranded DNA (green fluorescence) versus single-stranded DNA(red luminescence)&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;. Aside from propidium iodide and acridine orange, quantifiable dyes that are frequently used include (but are not limited to) DRAQ5, [[7-Aminoactinomycin D]], [[DAPI]] and [[Hoechst 33342]].

===Doublet discrimination===

Since cells and especially fixed cells tend to stick together, cell aggregates have to be excluded from analysis through a process called ''doublet discrimination''. This is important because a doublet of two G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; cells has the same total content of DNA and thus the same fluorescence intensity as a single G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/M cell.&lt;ref&gt;Sharpless T, Traganos F, Darzynkiewicz Z, Melamed MR. (1975) Flow cytofluorimetry: discrimination between single cells and cell aggregates by direct size measurements. Acta Cytol. 19(6):577-81. {{PMID|1108568}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unless recognized as such the G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; doublets would contribute to [[false positive]] identification and count of G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/M cells.

==Related methods==

===Nicoletti assay===

The '''Nicoletti assay''', named after its inventor, the Italian physician [[Ildo Nicoletti]], is a modified form of cell cycle analysis. It is used to detect and quantify [[apoptosis]], a form of [[programmed cell death]], by analysing cells with a DNA content less than 2n ("sub-G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; cells"). Such cells are usually the result of [[apoptotic DNA fragmentation]]: during apoptosis, the DNA is degraded by cellular [[endonuclease]]s. Therefore, [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] of apoptotic cells contain less DNA than nuclei of healthy G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; cells, resulting in a sub-G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; peak in the fluorescence [[histogram]] that can be used to determine the relative amount of apoptotic cells in a sample.This method was developed and first described in 1991 by Nicoletti and co-workers at [[University of Perugia|Perugia University]] School of Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The '''Center for NanoScience''' (CeNS) was founded in 1998 at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwig-Maximilians-University]] (LMU) in [[Munich]]. Its aim is to promote, bundle and join interdisciplinary research in the field of [[nanoscience]] in the Munich area. CeNS is an association of working groups from basic research and industry and acts as a network which connects various institutions from a variety of disciplines. The members cooperate in a horizontal structure based on voluntary commitment, and are supported by a small coordination team. 

CeNS consolidates research activities at the nanometer scale from physics, chemistry, biochemistry, and medicine. The CeNS network promotes the mutual understanding and the collaboration between these disciplines by joint seminars, workshops, and schools.

The '''Centre for Dialogue''' is an interdisciplinary [[research]] institution at [[La Trobe University]]. Professor Joseph Camilleri was the Director of the Centre from 2006 until 2013. The current Director is Professor Alberto Gomez. The research centre specialises in the ''philosophy, method'' and ''practice'' of [[dialogue]] between [[communities]], [[cultures]], [[religions]] and [[civilisations]]. The key aims of the Centre include:
* Educational projects designed to promote inter-cultural/inter-civilisational dialogue in schools and universities
* Research that addresses the challenges and opportunities presented by cultural, religious and political diversity and conflict
* Policy advice to governmental bodies, international agencies and non-governmental organisations
* Events, such as public forums, conferences, workshops, professional development days, courses, seminars consultations and media events
* Publications, such as working papers, books, articles, reports and media comment.

==Projects of the Centre==
[[Image:CfD Flyer Collage 2.JPG|200px|thumb]] 

The focus of the Centre is largely concentrated on inter-cultural, inter-religious conflict and inter-civilisational conflict, as well as the researching of practical methods of dialogue which may encourage [[peace]]ful [[resolution (policy debate)|resolutions]] to conflict and mechanisms for [[cooperation]].

The Centre for Dialogue has several current ongoing projects which act as the hallmark of the institutions' study. 

Examples of such ongoing projects are investigating the tensions relations to the role of religion and culture in international politics, particularly since the [[September 11 attacks|11 September terrorist attacks]]. Such projects continue to focus on how the [[government]], [[international non-governmental organisation|nongovernment]] and [[civil society]] sectors have responded, most notable in [[Europe]], the [[United States]], and [[Asia]] (including [[Australia]]). The projects investigate both domestic conflict (for example, strategies to curb escalating tensions between Muslims and non-Muslims) and international tensions (for example, the implications arising from the rise of [[Political Islam]] and the [[War on Terror]] in international politics).

Other projects include:
* The '''Education Dialogue Project''', which has investigated ways that dialogue can enhance intercultural awareness and understanding in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] schools.
* The '''Dialogue Diaspora Project''' which explores the nature of tensions between ethno-nationalist [[diaspora|diasporic]] communities in [[Australia]] whose homelands are in conflict (for example, the Sri Lankan, Iraqi and Cypriot communities). The project examines the formation and transformation of such conflicts in Australia and explores practical dialogical methods to reduce their impact.
* The '''Northern Interfaith Network''' which is developing a network of initiatives in [[Melbourne|Melbourne’s]] culturally-diverse northern suburbs with five municipalities and seven organisations. It aims to provide government agencies (federal and state), religious and ethnic groups and community organisations with tested guidelines to facilitate community based dialogue initiatives.

The Centre for Dialogue also runs several educational programmes, such as the '''Muslim Leadership Program for Young Muslims''' which aims to empower young Muslim men and women and help them to reach their full potential as citizens and future leaders.

==Publications==
[[Image:CfD Flyer Collage.JPG|250px|thumb|left]]

The Centre for Dialogue composes and distributes publications arising from their diverse research projects. This includes the publication of books, edited volumes and journal articles, as well as discussion papers that are distributed to relevant organisations and government departments. The Centre also distributes a bi-annual newsletter that reports on the Centre’s activities, as well as includes opinion pieces on issues that relate to the Centre’s interests.

The Centre for Dialogue also distributes several working papers each year that do not necessarily relate to the Centre’s projects. [[Monograph]]s are submitted to the Centre to be considered by the editorial committee for [[publication]]. The intention of the Working Papers is to provide the research community (including students and academics), policy-makers, journalists and community leaders with an opportunity to contribute to ongoing debates. Papers are preferred to focus on the dynamics of conflict (whether intrastate, inter-state, or trans-state). They generally must also identify ways in which the theory and/or practice of ''dialogue'' has contributed to coexistence, co-operation and mutual enrichment and highlight methods that may foster peaceful relations in the future.

The Centre for Dialogue and its staff provide the core of the editorial input of the scholarly journal, [https://web.archive.org/web/20061231062815/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/14781158.html ''Global Change, Peace and Security''], published by Routledge and edited from La Trobe University.

The previous Director; Professor Joseph Camilleri's most recent book, co-authored with Professor Jim Falk, was launched by UNDP head, the Hon Helen Clark, in Sydney, Australia in February 2010. The book "Worlds in Transition: Evolving Governance Across a Stressed Planet", Edward Elgar, UK, is a synoptic overview of the way in which humans have come to collectively seek to shape their futures, and the challenges posed to that in a time of rapid transition. 

The Centre for Dialogue hosts one major national or international conference and one major public lecture each year, such as an international conference titled ‘Europe and Asia: Between Islam and the United States’ in 2008, and a 2009 controversial keynote address by former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.

'''Chartered IT Professional''' (in full, '''Chartered Information Technology Professional''') denoted by '''CITP''' is a professional qualification awarded under [[Royal Charter]] to [[Information Technology|IT]] professionals who satisfy strict criteria set by the [[British Computer Society]] (BCS), which is a professional body for IT in the [[United Kingdom]].

==Status==
The title Chartered IT Professional is aligned with [[Skills Framework for the Information Age]] (SFIA), the UK Government backed competency framework, CITP is the benchmark of IT excellence and is terminal (final/top most) qualification in IT.

Criteria and requirements for chartered status in the UK have to be approved by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] and as such the CITP designation is on par with other chartered qualifications in other fields (such as the [[Chartered Accountant]] qualification awarded by the [[ICAEW]]).

CITP status is gaining increasing national and international recognition as the benchmark of excellence for IT professionals. It provides evidence of an individual’s commitment to their profession and endorsement of their experience and knowledge.

==Eligibility==
In order to qualify for this award a person normally needs to have at least 8 to 10 years professional experience in IT, with evidence of experience at a senior level (5) in the [[Skills Framework for the Information Age]] (SFIA), have passed a professional competency examination and successfully completed a skills assessment interview with two BCS assessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcs.org/category/10976 |title=CITP Assessment criteria |website=British Computer Society |accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fast track scheme exists for holders of Certified Architect and Certified IT Specialist certifications from [[The Open Group]], which exempts applicants from the initial review and interview elements of the application process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcs.org/category/16485 |title=CITP - The Open Group Fast Track Scheme |website=British Computer Society |accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to maintain a certificate of current competence, demonstrable [[Continuing Professional Development|CPD]] must be undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcs.org/category/17167 |title=Revalidation |website=British Computer Society |accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Designatory lettering==
Chartered IT Professionals are entitled to use the [[Post-nominal letters|suffix]] '''CITP''' after their names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcs.org/category/10974 |title=Benefits of CITP status |website=British Computer Society |accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is written after [[orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|honours, decorations]] and [[Academic degree|university degrees]] and after letters denoting membership of professional engineering institutions - for example: '''BSc (Hons), MBCS CITP'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://faq.bcs.org/faq/questions/1204/In+which+order+should+my+post-nominal+letters+appear%3F |title=BCS FAQ: In which order should my post-nominal letters appear? |website=British Computer Society |accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2440">The '''Coastal Observatory''' in Liverpool Bay is housed at the [[Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory]] in Brownlow Street
[[Liverpool]], [[England]].

== Objectives ==
The objective of the Coastal Observatory is to study a typical coastal sea's response both to natural forces and to the effects of human activity. The Observatory integrates real-time data measurements with data from models into a "pre-operational coastal prediction system"&lt;sup&gt;[http://cobs.pol.ac.uk/cobsadmin/about.html]&lt;/sup&gt; whose results will be displayed on the [http://cobs.pol.ac.uk web site].

The concept is founded on obtaining data in real time, using telemetry, sending the data from underwater to the sea surface, to land, to the [[Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory]] to the [http://cobs.pol.ac.uk web site], enabling what is often known as 'armchair oceanography'.

The aim of the Coastal Observatory is to build a time series of data. The Observatory has a particular interest in such areas as storm surges, seasonality, and variations in river discharge, with an emphasis on the River Mersey.

== Measurements ==
August 2007 marked five years of continuous running of the Coastal Observatory in Liverpool Bay, taking measurements such as:
*In situ time series of current, temperature and salinity profiles and of waves and weather. A second site, and measurements of turbidity and chlorophyll are now also operational.
*The [http://www.cefas.co.uk/Products/smartbuoy.htm CEFAS SmartBuoy] for surface properties including nutrients and chlorophyll.
*Instrumented ferries for near surface temperature, salinity, turbidity, chlorophyll and later, nutrient data. The first route was Liverpool to Douglas (Isle of Man), with the ferry travelling between Birkenhead (Liverpool) and Dublin (Ireland)
*Drifters, measuring surface currents and properties such as temperature and salinity.
*Tide gauges, with sensors for meteorological, waves, temperature and salinity data, where appropriate.
*Meteorological data from HF radar and tide gauge sites.
*Shore-base HF radar measuring waves and surface currents out to a range of 50&amp;nbsp;km.
*Satellite data - infra-red (for [[sea surface temperature]]) and visible (for chlorophyll and suspended sediment) spectra.

{{Expand Hungarian|Társadalomelméleti Kollégium|date=November 2011}}
The '''College for Advanced Studies in Social Theory''' ({{lang-hu|Társadalomelméleti Kollégium}}, ''TEK'') is the second oldest college of its type at the [[Corvinus University of Budapest]] as well as in [[Hungary]].

== History ==

TEK is the second oldest, still operating, college in Hungary. It was founded in 1981 by young researchers and students. Its orientation can be divided into two parts: vocational work and community life. The first is well documented, the latter is somewhat more distorted, due to the effects of [[collective memory]].
[[Image:Marx old.jpg|thumb|right|[[Karl Marx]]]]

=== 1981–present ===

TEK seceded from the first established college in Hungary, the [[Rajk László College for Advanced Studies]].
However, in the beginning - before [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]] - the College's main topic was the reinterpretation of [[Marx]]'s ouvre, since liberal and alternative thinking was only possible if it was related to Marxist studies. With the fall of the iron curtain, this coercion disappeared, and since the College's main profile was its diversity and openness to new ideas, philosophies and theories, the College's profile now freely and rapidly ramified into diverse - and pioneering among the Hungarian colleges at that time - topics: [[environmentalism]], [[sustainability]], [[postmodernism]], [[anarchism]], [[postmarxism]], [[sociolinguistics]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[post-structuralism]], [[Buddhist economics]], [[feminism]], [[minority group|sociology of minorities]], [[queer studies]], [[postcolonialism]], [[network theory]]. The College also dealt with the topic of [[squatting]], the sociological causes of [[poverty]] and since the establishment the farmost detailed analysis of [[critical theory]]/[[Frankfurt school]] among other colleges.

== Philosophical principles ==
=== Criticism ===

TEK is providing a critical approach to the economical theories that Corvinus University has in its educational program– among others, focusing on the social inequalities [[human resources]], [[structuralism]], [[neoliberalism]], [[functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]], [[corporatism]] inherently bares -.
TEK is also involved in highly regarded green activism, such as [[critical mass]], [[gay pride]], many [[flashmob]]s, that are held in support of promoting a livable environment. Among the members of TEK are also permanent supporters of the anti-[[g8]] anti-[[g20]] demonstrations.

=== Commune ===
The TEK started a lifestyle experiment, by establishing - again firstly - the habit of an annual [[commune (intentional community)|commune]],  in which the members apply voluntarily. These communes give the participants the opportunity to experience such a lifestyle that is hard to experience among European [[capitalist]] societies. In these communities the members share all goods, live together in one place creating a highly tied community of a few.

=== Aims ===

TEK’s main aim is a critical approach to the topics taught in Corvinus University.
TEK is more of a theoretical college, putting theoretical approaches to the questions of the society in front of bare statistical analysis, processing of data.
However members of TEK – individually - are highly involved in diverse fields of practice – e.g. organizing conferences on behalf of the homeless, many voluntary work promoting the reintegration of gypsies into the labour market, helping the educational development of those from less developed areas -.

== Vocational work ==
=== Tutorials ===

The base of the vocational work in TEK are the annual or semi-annual Tutorials. The topics of these Tutorials are given by the members of the College, which Tutorials are to be held by the tutors after compiling a schedule. The participants analyse, discuss the literature together with the tutor. As a conclusion, at the end of every tutorial, the participants are to hand in an essay of one of the topics that were discussed during the Tutorial.
The main frame for the Tutorials are based on 5 main fields: [[political economy]], economics of [[globalization]], Frankfurt School, [[green economics|green]] and [[Justice (economics)|ethical]] economics, postmodern sociology.
Every fresher has to participate in the Ground Tutorial, which provides a brief insight to the work and schedule of all five fields.

=== Related works ===

[http://fordulat.net Fordulat] (meaning “facing” or “twist”) is the official periodical of the College, dealing with many critical and however yet not mainstream, but pioneering topics.

=== Conferences ===

Among many others, [[Claus Offe]], one of the leading political sociologists and of the second generation Frankfurt School attended one of the conferences held by the College.

'''Dennis Wojtkiewicz''' (born 1956, Chicago, Illinois) is an American [[Hyperrealism (painting)|Hyperrealist]] painter and draughtsman.

Wojtkiewicz graduated from [[Southern Illinois University]] and is artist associated with the Hyperrealist movement. He is best known for his large scale renderings of sliced fruit and flowers. In order to achieve his desired effect, technically, Wojtkiewicz relies on traditional oil paint and brushes with a classical application, he also uses pastel for his drawings.

Dennis Wojtkiewicz has exhibited his work in leading fine art galleries in the United States and abroad. His work is owned by many leading private, corporate and public collections including the Evanston Museum of Art, [[Fidelity Investments]] in Boston and the [[University of South Dakota]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6282">[[Image:dry pond.jpg|thumb|Detention Basin]]
A '''detention basin''' or '''retarding basin''' is an excavated area installed on, or adjacent to, tributaries of [[river]]s, [[stream]]s, [[lake]]s or [[bay]]s to protect against [[flood]]ing and, in some cases, downstream [[erosion]] by storing water for a limited period of time.  These basins are also called "dry ponds", "holding ponds" or "dry detention basins" if no permanent pool of water exists. Some detention ponds are also "wet ponds" in that they are designed to permanently retain some volume of water at all times. In its basic form, a detention basin is used to manage water quantity while having a limited effectiveness in protecting [[water quality]], unless it includes a permanent pool feature.&lt;ref&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, DC.[http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/index.cfm?action=browse&amp;Rbutton=detail&amp;bmp=67 "National Menu of Stormwater Best Management Practices."] Fact Sheet: "Dry Detention Ponds."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions and design==
Detention basins are storm water [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]] that provide general flood protection  and can also control extreme floods such as a 1 in 100-year storm event.&lt;ref&gt;Atlanta Regional Commission. Atlanta, GA. [http://www.georgiastormwater.com/vol2/3-4-1.pdf "Georgia Stormwater Management Manual."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410222514/http://www.georgiastormwater.com/vol2/3-4-1.pdf |date=2008-04-10 }} Section 3.4.1: "Dry Detention / Dry ED Basins." August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The basins are typically built during the construction of new land development projects including residential subdivisions or shopping centers.  The ponds help manage the excess [[urban runoff]] generated by newly constructed [[impervious surface]]s such  as [[road]]s, [[parking lot]]s and [[rooftop]]s.

A basin functions by allowing large flows of water to enter but limits the outflow by having a small opening at the lowest point of the structure.  The size of this opening is determined by the capacity of  underground and downstream [[culvert]]s and [[Arroyo (creek)|washes]]  to handle the release of the contained water.&lt;ref&gt;Dykehouse, Terry, P.E. Jones and Edmunds, Gainseville, FL.[http://www.florida-stormwater.org/pdfs/pondsarticle.pdf "Retention Ponds and Detention Ponds, The Recovery Process."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410222514/http://www.florida-stormwater.org/pdfs/pondsarticle.pdf |date=2008-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently the inflow area is constructed to protect the structure from some types of damage.  Offset [[concrete]] blocks in the entrance spillways are used to reduce the speed of entering flood water.  These structures may also have [[debris]] drop vaults to collect large rocks.  These vaults are deep holes under the entrance to the structure.  The holes are wide enough to allow large rocks and other debris to fall into the holes before they can damage the rest of the structure.  These vaults must be emptied after each storm event.

===New approaches===
Research has shown that detention basins built with real-time control of the outflow from the basin are significantly more effective at retaining [[total suspended solids]] and associated contaminants, such as [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]], when compared to basins without control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecohydraulic-driven Real-Time Control of Stormwater Basins|url=http://modeleau.fsg.ulaval.ca/fileadmin/modeleau/documents/Publications/pvr862.pdf|work=Universite Laval|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extended detention basin==
A variant basin design called an '''extended detention dry basin''' can limit downstream erosion and control of some [[water pollution|pollutants]] such as [[suspended solids]]. This basin type differs from a [[retention basin]], also known as a "wet pond," which includes a permanent pool of water, and which is typically designed to protect water quality.&lt;ref name="WEF1"&gt;[http://wef.org Water Environment Federation], Alexandria, VA; and [http://www.asce.org American Society of Civil Engineers], Reston, VA. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AdU-VXXV_H0C "Urban Runoff Quality Management."] WEF Manual of Practice No. 23; ASCE Manual and Report on Engineering Practice No. 87. 1998. {{ISBN|1-57278-039-8}}. Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Worth Bagley College. [http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080410222514/http://www.abe.msstate.edu/csd/p-dm/all-chapters/chapter4/chapter4/det-basin.pdf "Detention Basins."] Chapter 4: Best Management Practices. Agricultural and Biological Engineering, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. [http://proteus.pca.state.mn.us/publications/swm-ch5.pdf "Stormwater Detention Ponds."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410222514/http://proteus.pca.state.mn.us/publications/swm-ch5.pdf |date=2008-04-10 }} Chapter 5, Minnesota State Permit Guidance Document.&lt;/ref&gt;

While basic detention ponds are often designed to empty within 6 to 12 hours after a storm, extended detention (ED) dry basins improve on the basic detention design by lengthening the storage time, for example, to 24 or 48 hours. Longer storage times tend to result in improved water quality because  additional suspended solids are removed.&lt;ref name="WEF1" /&gt;

'''Duncan's taxonomy''' is a classification of [[computer architecture]]s, proposed by Ralph Duncan in 1990.&lt;ref name=duncan&gt;Duncan, Ralph, "A Survey of Parallel Computer Architectures", IEEE Computer. February 1990, pp. 5-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan proposed modifications to [[Flynn's taxonomy]]&lt;ref name=flynn&gt;Flynn, M.J., "Very High Speed Computing Systems", Proc. IEEE. Vol. 54, 1966, pp.1901-1909.&lt;/ref&gt; to include pipelined vector processes.&lt;ref name=vhsc&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W3Ld65MnwgkC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=Duncan%27s+Taxonomy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TcxNTapqdo&amp;sig=ck7xsVYTYnJVsaS8Swxy23d6AHc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=L7ArTOG7CsGBlAe_tN2vCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Duncan%27s%20Taxonomy&amp;f=false Introduction to Parallel Algorithms]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
The taxonomy was developed during 1988-1990 and was first published in 1990.  Its original categories are indicated below.

===Synchronous Architectures===
This category includes all the parallel architectures that coordinate concurrent execution in lockstep fashion and do so via mechanisms such as global clocks, central control units or vector unit controllers.  Further subdivision of this category is made primarily on the basis of the synchronization mechanism.&lt;ref name=duncan/&gt;

====Pipelined vector processors====
''Pipelined vector processors'' are characterized by pipelined functional units that accept a sequential stream of array or ''vector'' elements, such that different stages in a filled pipeline are processing different elements of the vector at a given time.&lt;ref name="Hwang84"&gt;Hwang, K., ed., ''Tutorial Supercomputers: Design and Applications.'' Computer Society Press, Los Alamitos, California, 1984, esp. chapters 1 and 2.&lt;/ref&gt;   Parallelism is provided both by the pipelining in individual functional units described above, as well as by operating multiple units of this kind in parallel and by ''chaining'' the output of one unit into another unit as input.&lt;ref name="Hwang84"/&gt;

Vector architectures that stream vector elements into functional units from special vector registers are termed ''register-to-register'' architectures, while those that feed functional units from special memory buffers are designated as '' memory-to-memory'' architectures.&lt;ref name="duncan"/&gt;  Early examples of register-to-register architectures from the 1960s and early 1970s include the [[Cray-1]]&lt;ref name="Russell78"&gt;Russell, R.M., "The CRAY-1 Computer System," Comm. ACM, Jan. 1978, pp. 63-72.&lt;/ref&gt; and Fujitsu VP-200, while the Control Data Cyber 205 and Texas Instruments Advanced Scientific Computer&lt;ref name="Watson72"&gt;Watson, W.J., ''The ASC: a Highly Modular Flexible Super Computer Architecture,'' Proc. AFIPS Fall Joint Computer Conference, 1972, pp. 221-228.&lt;/ref&gt;  are early examples of memory-to-memory vector architectures.

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the introduction of vector architectures, such as the Cray Y-MP/4 and Nippon Electric Corporation SX-3 that supported 4-10 vector processors with a shared memory (see [[NEC SX architecture]]).

====SIMD====

This scheme uses the ''SIMD'' (Single Instruction Stream, Multiple Data Stream) category from [[Flynn's Taxonomy]] as a root class for ''Processor Array'' and ''Associative Memory'' subclasses.  SIMD architectures&lt;ref name="simd96"&gt;Michael Jurczyk and Thomas Schwederski,"SIMD-Processing: Concepts and Systems", pp. 649-679 in Parallel and Distributed Computing Handbook, A. Zomaya, ed., McGraw-Hill, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; are characterized by having a control unit broadcast a common instruction to all processing elements, which execute that instruction in lockstep on diverse operands from local data.  Common features include the ability for individual processors to disable an instruction and the ability to propagate instruction results to immediate neighbors over an interconnection network.

=====Processor Array=====

=====Associative Memory=====

====Systolic Array====
''Systolic arrays,'' proposed during the 1980s&lt;ref name="HTKung"&gt;Kung, H.T., "Why Systolic Arrays?", Computer, Vol. 15, No. 1, Jan. 1982, pp. 37-46.&lt;/ref&gt; are multiprocessors in which data and partial results are rhythmically pumped from processor to processor through a regular, local interconnection network.&lt;ref name="duncan"/&gt;  Systolic architectures use a global clock and explicit timing delays to synchronize data flow from processor to processor.&lt;ref name="duncan"/&gt;  Each processor in a systolic system executes an invariant sequence of instructions before data and results are pulsed to neighboring processors.&lt;ref name="HTKung"/&gt;

===MIMD Architectures===
Based on Flynn's Multiple-Instruction-Multiple-Data Streams terminology, this category spans a wide spectrum of architectures in which processors execute multiple instruction sequences on (potentially) dissimilar data streams without strict synchronization.  Although both instruction and data streams can be different for each processor, they need not be.  Thus, MIMD architectures can run identical programs that are in various stages at any given time, run unique instruction and data streams on each processor or execute a combination of each these scenarios.  This category is subdivided further primarily on the basis of memory organization.&lt;ref name=duncan/&gt;

====Distributed Memory====

====Shared Memory====

===MIMD-paradigm Architectures===
The MIMD-Based Paradigms category subsumes systems in which a specific programming or execution paradigm is at least as fundamental 
to the architectural design as structural considerations are.  Thus, the design of ''dataflow architectures'' and ''reduction machines'' is as much the product of supporting their distinctive execution paradigm as it is a product of connecting processors and memories in MIMD fashion.  The category's subdivisions are defined by these paradigms.&lt;ref name=duncan/&gt;

====MIMD/SIMD hybrid====

====Dataflow Machine====

====Reduction Machine====

====Wavefront Array====

==In contrast to folk religion==
Elite religion is often contrasted with [[folk religion]], or the religious symbols and beliefs of the masses. Elite religion is then the "official religion" as championed by the leaders of a religion.

==Strengthening denominationalism==
Sociologist [[Charles Liebman]] theorized that the strengthening of elite religion over members of a particular group led to the growth of [[denominationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Liebman, Charles. ''The Ambivalent American Jew''. Jewish Publication Society. (1973): 83-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5154">{{Occupational hazards}}

'''Engineering controls''' are strategies designed to protect workers from [[Occupational hazard|hazardous conditions]] by placing a barrier between the worker and the hazard or by removing a hazardous substance through air [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/engcontrols/|title=NIOSH Directory of Engineering Controls|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roelofs2007"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-4lTEuFWtdIC&amp;pg=PA9|title=Preventing Hazards at the Source|first=Cora|date=1 January 2007|publisher=[[American Industrial Hygiene Association]]|year=|isbn=978-1-931504-83-6|location=|pages=9ff|author=Roelofs}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Engineering controls involve a physical change to the workplace itself, rather than relying on workers' behavior or requiring workers to wear protective clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dte/grant_materials/fy10/sh-20839-10/hierarchy_of_controls.pdf|title=Hierarchy of Controls|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineering controls is the third of five members of the [[hierarchy of hazard control]]s, which orders control strategies by their feasibility and effectiveness. Engineering controls are preferred over [[administrative controls]] and [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE) because they are designed to remove the hazard at the source, before it comes in contact with the worker. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection. The initial cost of engineering controls can be higher than the cost of administrative controls or PPE, but over the longer term, operating costs are frequently lower, and in some instances, can provide a cost savings in other areas of the process.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hierarchy/default.html|title=Hierarchy of Controls - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-30}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hazard elimination|Elimination]] and [[Hazard substitution|substitution]] are usually considered to be separate levels of hazard controls, but in some schemes they are categorized as types of engineering control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hsaa.ca/effective-representation/hazard-identification-elimination-and-control|title=Hazard Identification, Elimination and Control|last=|first=|date=|website=Health Sciences Association of Alberta|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314062833/https://www.hsaa.ca/effective-representation/hazard-identification-elimination-and-control|archive-date=2017-03-14|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://machinerysafety101.com/2011/02/28/understanding-the-hierarchy-of-controls/|title=Understanding the Hierarchy of Controls|last=Nix|first=Doug|date=2011-02-28|website=Machinery Safety 101|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Memento Timeline.png|thumb|230px|Timeline of fabula vs syuzhet in ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'']]
'''Fabula''' ({{lang-rus|фабула|p=ˈfabʊlə}}) and '''syuzhet'''&lt;ref&gt;Also [[romanization of Russian|romanised]] as ''sjuzhet'', ''sujet'', ''sjužet'', ''siuzhet'' or ''suzet''.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-rus|сюжет|p=sʲʊˈʐɛt|a=Ru-сюжет.ogg}}) are terms originating in [[Russian formalism]] and employed in [[narratology]] that describe [[narrative]] construction. Syuzhet is an employment of narrative and fabula is the chronological order of the events contained in the story. They were first used in this sense by [[Vladimir Propp]] and [[Viktor Shklovsky]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The fabula is "the raw material of a story", and syuzhet is "the way a story is organized".&lt;ref&gt;Cobley, Paul. "Narratology." The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics]]'', narrative plots are supposed to have a beginning, middle and end. This is often achieved in film and novels via [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s or [[flashforward]]s. For example, the film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' starts with the death of the main character, and then tells his life through flashbacks interspersed with a journalist's present-time investigation of Kane's life. The fabula of the film is the actual story of Kane's life the way it happened in chronological order, while the syuzhet is the way the story is told throughout the movie, including flashbacks.

==Critical reviews==

===Poststructuralism===
[[Jonathan Culler]] in ''The Pursuit of Signs: Semiotics, Literature, Deconstruction'' (1981) notes a certain contradiction in assigning priority to either fabula or syuzhet (170-172). The operative assumption amongst many literary critics is that fabula precedes the syuzhet, which provides one of many ways of rendering what took place in the story. Culler argues that one can also understand fabula as a production of the syuzhet, whereby certain events are created and ordered at the level of story in order to produce a meaningful narrative. Critics, he argues, subscribe to a view in which fabula precedes syuzhet when debating the significance of a character's actions, but adopt the opposite view when they discuss the "appropriateness" of a narrative's ending (178). 

[[Jacques Derrida]] (1979) is also critical of the logocentric hierarchic ordering of syuzhet and fabula. He raises the question, "What if there are story ways of telling as well as narrative ways of telling? And if so, how is it that narrative in the American-European tradition has become privileged over story?" One answer is that narrative is both syuzhet (employment) and a subjection of fabula (the stuff of story, represented through narrative). For example, Derrida views narrative as having a terrible secret, in its way of oppressing story:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The question-of-narrative covers, with a certain modesty, a demand for narrative, a violent putting-to-the-question, an instrument of torture working to wring out the narrative as if it were a terrible secret, in ways that can go from the most archaic police methods to refinements for making (and even letting) one talk unsurpassed in neutrality and politeness, most respectfully medical, psychiatric, and even psychoanalytic. (Derrida, 1979: 94).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If story is more than fabula, dominated by narrative, it could have its own manner of discourse, rather than being subordinate to narrative. Derrida plays with just such an idea as follows in setting story in relation to its homonym:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Each "story" (and each occurrence of the word "story", each "story" in the story) is part of the other, makes the other part (of itself), each "story" is at once larger and smaller than itself, includes itself without including (or comprehending) itself, identifies itself with itself even as it remains utterly different from its homonym. (Derrida, 1979: 99-100).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Symbolic interactionism===
[[Jerome Bruner]] also raises issues about fabula and syuzhet. He summarizes syuzhet as the plot of narrative, and fabula as a timeless underlying theme (Bruner, 1986, pp.&amp;nbsp;7, 17-21). Bruner wants fabula to be a little more "loose fitting a constraint" on story: "I think we would do well with as loose fitting a constraint as we can manage concerning what a story must 'be' to be a story" (p.&amp;nbsp;17).

The problem for Bruner is to explore the underlying narrative structures (syuzhets) in not only Russian formalism, but also [[Structuralism|French Structuralism]] ([[Roland Barthes]], [[Tzvetan Todorov]] and others). The European formalists posit narrative grammars (i.e. Todorov's simple transformations of mode, intention, result, manner, aspect and status, as well as complex transformations of appearance, knowledge, supposition, description, subjectification and attitude). For Bruner, the story (fabula stuff) becomes the "virtual text" (p.&amp;nbsp;32) to the narrative grammars. "Nevertheless, Shotter suggests that Bruner failed to engage these 'particularities of otherness' in favour of abstractive explanation of meaning-making processes rather than in a description of dialogical performances" (Mos, 2003: 2). In other words, there is a need to consider how narrative pursues grammars and abstract meaning frames, whereas story can be dialogic and in the web of the social.

===Language studies===
[[Mikhail Bakhtin]] is also not convinced that fabula and syuzhet is a complete explanation of the relationship of narrative and story. Like Derrida, he is suspicious of the hegemony of narrative over story.

For Bakhtin (1973: 12) "narrative genres are always enclosed in a solid and unshakable monological framework." Story, for Bakhtin, is decidedly more dialogue-based, for example in the "polyphonic manner of the story" (Bakhtin, 1973: 60).

[[Benjamin Whorf]] (1956: 256), following up an observation by [[Franz Boas]], contended that the [[Hopi]] Indians do not experience themselves, or life as narrative grammar, or pattern. Rather than past-present-future, as segregated syuzhet, the Hopi experience is one of "eventing." Shotter (1993: 109) refers to Whorf's "eventing" and to the Hopi's differences with Euro-American space and time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2479">A '''facultative parasite''' is an  [[organism]] that may resort to [[Parasite|parasitic]] activity, but does not absolutely rely on any [[host (biology)|host]] for completion of its [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]].

Examples of facultative parasitism occur among many species of [[Fungus|fungi]], such as family members of the [[genus]] ''[[Armillaria]]''. ''Armillaria'' species do parasitise living trees, but if the tree dies, whether as a consequence of the fungal infection or not, the fungus continues to eat the wood without further need for parasitic activity; some species even can ingest dead wood without any parasitic activity at all. As such, although they also are important [[Ecology|ecological]] agents in the process of [[Nutrient cycle|nutrient recycling]] by microbial decomposition, the fungi become pests in their role as destructive agents of [[Wood-decay fungus|wood rot]].&lt;ref&gt;Agrios, George N. Plant Pathology. Publisher: Academic Press 2005. {{ISBN|978-0120445653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, green plants in [[Genus|genera]] such as ''[[Rhinanthus]]'' and [[Colpoon]] can grow independently of any host, but they also act [[Opportunism#Biological opportunism|opportunistically]] as facultative root parasites of neighboring green plants.

Among animals, facultatively [[Kleptoparasitism|kleptoparasitic]] species generally can survive by hunting or [[Scavenger|scavenging]] for themselves, but it often is more profitable for them to rob food from other animals kleptoparasitically, whether their hosts are of the same species or not. Such behavior occurs in lions and hyaenas for example, and also among insects such as "Jackal flies" in the family [[Milichiidae]].

More intimately, normally free-living microbes may opportunistically live as facultative parasites in other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds Bruce D. "Colpoda steini, a Facultative Parasite of the Land Slug, Agriolimax agrestis" The Journal of Parasitology Vol. 22, No. 1 (Feb., 1936), pp. 48-53. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3271896&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this in humans is [[Naegleria fowleri]]. As a rule this [[amoeboid]] species is a free-living predator on microbes, but occasionally it successfully infects humans as a facultative internal parasite.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/general.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Figleafva.jpg|thumb|A fig leaf cast in plaster used to cover the genitals of a copy of a statue of David in the [[Cast Courts (Victoria and Albert Museum)|Cast Courts of the Victoria and Albert Museum]]. In the reign of [[Queen Victoria]], display of male nudity was contentious and the Queen herself was said to find it shocking. The museum commissioned this fig leaf and kept it in readiness in case of a visit by the Queen or other female dignitaries: the fig leaf was then hung on the figure using a pair of hooks. Today, the fig leaf is no longer used, but it is displayed in a case at the back of the cast's plinth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Mercury fig leaf.jpg|thumb|A statue of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] holding the [[caduceus]] in the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]], with a fig leaf placed over the genitalia. The fig leaf was placed there under the more "[[chaste]]" [[Pope]]s; later, most such coverings were removed.]]

The expression "'''fig leaf'''" is widely used figuratively to convey the covering up of an act or an object that is embarrassing or distasteful with something of innocuous appearance, a [[metaphor]]ical reference to the [[Biblical]] [[Book of Genesis]], in which [[Adam and Eve]] used [[ficus|fig]] leaves to cover their [[nudity]] after eating the forbidden fruit from the [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]]. Some paintings and statues have the genitals of their subjects covered by a representation of an actual fig leaf or similar object, either as part of the work or added afterwards for perceived modesty.

==History==

In [[Ancient Greek art]], male nakedness, including the [[genitals]], was common, although the female [[Mons pubis|vulval area]] &lt;!--anyone offended by this link may substitute [[groin]]--&gt; was generally covered in art for public display.  This tradition continued in [[Ancient Roman art]] until the conversion of the [[Roman Empire]] to [[Christianity]], when [[heroic nudity]] vanished.  During the [[Middle Ages]], only the unfortunate (most often the [[damnation|damned]]) were usually shown naked, although the depictions were then often rather explicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kenneth |last=Clark |title=The Nude, A Study in Ideal Form |year=1956 |isbn=0-691-01788-3 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam and Eve were often shown wearing fig or other leaves, following the Biblical description.  This was especially a feature of [[Northern Renaissance]] art.

From about 1530, the developing reaction to [[Renaissance]] freedoms and excesses that led to the [[Council of Trent]] also led to a number of artworks, especially in churches or public places, being altered to reduce the amount of nudity on display.  Often, as in the famous case of [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgement]]'', drapery or extra branches from any nearby bush was used. This has been dubbed the "fig leaf campaign". For free-standing statues this did not work well, and carved or cast fig leaves were sometimes added, such as with the plaster copy of Michelangelo's ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' displayed in [[Victorian era]] [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David's Fig Leaf|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/sculpture/stories/david/index.html|publisher=Victoria &amp; Albert Museum|accessdate=2017-02-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603175714/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/sculpture/stories/david/index.html|archivedate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Adam and Eve panels on the ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', already equipped with fig leaves by [[Jan van Eyck]],  were simply replaced with 19th-century panels copying the figures but clothed.   Many of these alterations have since been reversed, damaging some of the statues.

==Modern day==
[[File:Falk,_Benjamin_J._(1853-1925)_-_Eugen_Sandow_(1867-1925)-_1894.jpg|thumb|right|275px|In this photo, Sandow portrays ''[[The Dying Gaul]]'', a pose taken from an ancient Roman sculpture.]]

[[Eugen Sandow]], often considered the first modern-day [[bodybuilder]], was an admirer of the human physique, and in addition to strongman [[sideshow]]s; he performed "muscle displays" by posing in the nude — save for a fig leaf that he would don in imitation of statues he had seen in [[Italy]] as a boy.&lt;ref name=sandow&gt;{{cite web |last= Anderson |first= R. Christian |url= http://www.sandowmuseum.com/page7.html |title= Sandow Wearing a Figleaf |publisher= SandowMuseum.com |accessdate= 2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphorical use==
[[File:Masaccio-TheExpulsionOfAdamAndEveFromEden-Restoration.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''[[The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden]]'', by [[Masaccio]], before and after restoration. It was painted in 1425, covered up in 1680, and restored in 1980.]]

The expression ''fig leaf'' has a [[pejorative]] [[metaphor]]ical sense meaning a flimsy or minimal cover for anything or behaviour that might be considered shameful, with the implication that the cover is only a token gesture and the truth is obvious to all who choose to see it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7746088.stm |title=Cable derides 'fig leaf' tax cuts |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2010-09-16 | date=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A metaphorical fig leaf is something visible but innocuous, as against a [[coverup]] in which the existence of something may be entirely hidden.

In the context of negotiation, an offer might be characterized as a "fig leaf" if that offer is actually a ploy to conceal a sinister plan.

'''Frost crack''' or '''Southwest canker'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160204110410/http://treedoctor.anr.msu.edu/landscape_tips/Oct13_SouthwestCanker.pdf Southwest Canker]&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of [[tree]] bark damage sometimes found on thin barked trees, visible as vertical [[fracture]]s on the southerly facing surfaces of tree trunks. Frost crack is distinct from [[Sun scald (flora)|sun scald]] and [[sun crack]] and physically differs from normal rough-bark characteristics as seen in mature [[oak]]s, [[pine]]s, [[Populus|poplar]]s and other tree species.

==Normal bark formation==
[[File:Bark of an old Sycamore.JPG|thumb|left|190px|[[Acer pseudoplatanus|Sycamore bark]] with normal sloughing plates]]
The sloughing or peeling of the bark is a normal process, especially in the spring when the tree begins to grow. The outer layers of the bark are dead tissue and therefore they cannot grow, the outer bark splitting in order for the tree to grow in circumference, increasing its diameter. The inner bark cambium and phloem tissues are living, and form a new protective layer of cells as the outer bark pulls apart.

Normal furrowed bark has a layer of bark over the wood below, however bark may peel or fall off the tree in sheets (river birch), plates (sycamore and pine), strips (cedar) or blocks (dogwood).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utextension.utk.edu/publications/spfiles/SP630.pdf Bark splitting on Trees]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Frost cracks are frequently the result of some sort of weakness in the bark which occurred to the tree earlier. In late winter and early spring, water in the phloem, known as the inner bark and in the xylem, known as the wood, expands and contracts under often significantly fluctuating temperatures. Wood that is in some way damaged does not contract to the same degree as healthy wood. Rapid expansion and contraction of water within the wood and bark, particularly under rapidly falling night temperatures, can result in a frost crack, often accompanied by a loud explosive report.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.mb.ca/agriculture/crops/diseases/fac46s00.html Winter Sunscald and Frost Cracking]&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that the main cause is actually 'frost-shrinkage' due to the freezing-out of cell wall moisture into lumens of wood cells. Other causes are the expansion of freezing water in cell lumens, and additionally the formation of [[ice lens]]es within wood. As stated, previous defects such as healed wounds, branch stubs, etc. in tree trunks function as stress raisers and trigger the frost cracking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/saf/fs/1983/00000029/00000003/art00018?crawler=true Mechanism of Frost Crack inTrees]&lt;/ref&gt;

In winter when the sun sets or the sky clouds over, the temperature of the tree drops very quickly and as the bark cools more quickly and the wood contracts more slowly, the bark rips open in a long crack, sometimes with an [[Exploding tree|audible report]] likened to a rifle crack.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KaJHBv9FbYIC&amp;pg=PA352&amp;lpg=PA352&amp;dq=frost+crack+bark&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2vTjsrCVq3&amp;sig=rO7WsiuFS-FuvB2uKl5dN-NP1J8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sUqQSrPjMeehjAf2yIH4DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=frost%20crack%20bark&amp;f=false The Climate near the Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=110&amp;dat=19580107&amp;id=-08JAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pkIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6303,212149 Ludington Daily News]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanext.illinois.edu/hortihints/0302b.html Home Hort hints.]&lt;/ref&gt; Cold, clear, sunny days are the most likely to result in frost cracking, particularly as the heat energy from the low Sun on a Winter day can be higher than any other time of year.

Trees that are growing in poorly drained sites are more subject to frost cracking than are those growing in drier, better drained soils.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joa.isa-arbor.com/request.asp?JournalID=1&amp;ArticleID=1538&amp;Type=2 Frost crack in Maple]&lt;/ref&gt; Trees suddenly left exposed by felling are highly susceptible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KaJHBv9FbYIC&amp;pg=PA352&amp;lpg=PA352&amp;dq=frost+crack+bark&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2vTjsrCVq3&amp;sig=rO7WsiuFS-FuvB2uKl5dN-NP1J8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sUqQSrPjMeehjAf2yIH4DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=frost%20crack%20bark&amp;f=false The Climate near the Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frost Crack on Horse Chestnut.JPG|thumb|upright|Frost crack in horse-chestnut bark]]
Although frost cracks may be up to several metres long, these cracks usually only become apparent in early spring; they are often found on the southwest side of the tree. These cracks may heal in the summer and be reopen again in the winters, so that successive cracking and healing over a number of years results in the formation of 'frost ribs' on the sides of affected trees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utextension.utk.edu/publications/spfiles/SP630.pdf Bark splitting on Trees]&lt;/ref&gt; The wood beneath the frost crack is rarely damaged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanext.illinois.edu/hortihints/0302b.html Home Hort hints.]&lt;/ref&gt; The cracks usually originate at the base of the trunk and extends from a metre to several metres upwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joa.isa-arbor.com/request.asp?JournalID=1&amp;ArticleID=1538&amp;Type=2 Frost crack in Maple]&lt;/ref&gt; Some discoloration is often found at the site of the damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treedictionary.com/DICT2003/hardtoget/ntb29/pg_51-75/index.html Tree Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of damage==
Frost cracks often act as sites of entry for wood decay organisms, including insects, fungi and bacteria. Timber damaged in this way is unsuitable for use in buildings, etc.

Species such as crab-apple, beech, walnut, oaks, maples, sycamore, horse-chestnut, willows and lime are prone to developing frost crack given the right conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utextension.utk.edu/publications/spfiles/SP630.pdf Bark splitting on Trees]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Avoiding the use of fertilizers late in the growing season can reduce the incidence of splits, also protecting the bark of young trees from physical damage such as that caused by lawn mowers, car bumpers, grazing animals, spades, strimmers, etc. Protect young trees in winter with paper tree wrap from ground level to the first main branches.

==Repair==
Most tree species try to seal the edges of wounds by forming a [[Callus|callus layer]]. The wound's edges begin to form this callus during the first growing season after that crack appears and the callus layer will continue to grow and after many years, the wound may close over entirely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanext.illinois.edu/hortihints/0302b.html Home Hort hints.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Googlearchy''', or googlocracy, is a term associated with ways in which a [[search engine]], like [[Google]], can influence politics and social reality in general. More broadly, the term is intended to reflect on how certain technological developments can influence or dominate the organization of society. The scope of the term can have a variety of uses, such as the issues with [[freedom of the press]] and how modern politics are done through the use of the internet, with technologies such as Google. One issue raised when considering the ''googlearchy'' phenomenon in web politics is in considering whether the changes brought by technologies such as Google have reinforced the media that is already more powerful, or the other way around. This embodies itself in the hierarchy of an internet search, in which traditional media outlets and institutions are often at the top of the page, allowing little room for non-traditional or non-mainstream media. Resultantly, this creates a discourse of consensus politics, reinforcing social and political norms.

The rising of the [[Pleiades]] heralded the start of the [[Ancient Greek]] sailing season, using [[celestial navigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pleiad, n |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=December 2014 |accessdate=2015-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause and significance==
[[Image:Kepler_Observatory_Linz_under_the_Stars.jpg|thumb|Sirius is the present star with the greatest [[apparent magnitude]] (after the sun) and one which is almost non-variable. The [[Pleiades]], a key feature of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] shown across [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] in the same photograph also experience an annual period of visibility ("rising and setting").]]
Relative to the other stars, the sun appears to drift eastward (about {{frac|1|365.24219}} of Earth's orbit—hence almost one degree—per solar day) along a path called the [[ecliptic]] (specifically appearing in front of 13 constellations considered the [[zodiac]] constellations from a total of [[88 modern constellations]]) which is, by definition, the plane of the earth's orbit.  While the sun appears in front of (or south or north of) a relatively small group of stars they can no longer be seen either before dawn, during daytime or after sunset{{efn|except as to those directly north and south of it can be observed in a full [[solar eclipse]] or other rare conditions e.g. near the poles in the very early or late day}} &amp;mdash; their appearance coincides with that of the sun above the [[horizon]].  Depending on the observer's latitude many stars are subject to annual heliacal risings and settings.  Rising means the local latitude of the earth has moved along its orbit such that the star, star cluster or galaxy emerges for part of the year to within months be visible for the whole night and then for the early portion of the night. Thus the star's first emergence, an annual rise, is immediately before dawn. The risen status of each star is easiest considered day-on-day in the [[tropics]] where the time of dawn varies less. The rising of a star which has had its annual rising ("heliacal rising"), typically over months, rises earlier at night and so at dawn figures more toward its annual highest point (meridian) and then in later dawns more toward the west all by about {{frac|1|182}}th of its arc (about {{frac|1|365}} of the circle) per day, until, observing the western sky after sunset, it has already disappeared. This is called the ''cosmical setting''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sizes.com/time/risesetstar.htm rising and setting of stars]&lt;/ref&gt; The same star will reappear in the eastern sky at dawn approximately one year after its previous rising. For zodiac and near-zodiac constellations (near the [[ecliptic]], the apparent daily path of the sun), Earth's [[precession of the equinoxes|precession]] means the date of their rising decreases gradually, completing one cycle in about 26,000 years (for example at the March Equinox, the position of the Sun relative the stars &amp;mdash; at which Right Ascension is calibrated as zero, the [[First Point of Aries]], is in the preceding constellation of Pisces.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeoastronomy.wordpress.com/2005/09/10/archaic-astronomy-and-heliacal-rising/ Archaic Astronomy and Heliacal Rising]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-application to circumpolar stars at extra-tropical latitudes==
Some stars, when viewed from [[latitude]]s outside of the tropics on Earth, do not rise or set. These are [[circumpolar star]]s, which are either always in the sky or never.  For example, the [[North Star]] (Polaris) is not visible in Australia and the [[Southern Cross]] is not seen in Europe, because they always stay below the respective horizons.  

The term ''circumpolar'' is somewhat localised as between the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator, the Southern polar constellations have a brief spell of annual visibility (thus "heliacal" rising and "cosmic" setting) and the same applies as to the other polar constellations in respect of the reverse tropic.

== History ==
Constellations containing stars that rise and set were incorporated into early [[calendar]]s or [[zodiac]]s. The [[Sumer]]ians, [[Babylonia]]ns, [[ancient Egyptians|Egyptians]], and [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] all used the heliacal risings of various stars for the timing of agricultural activities.

Because of its position about 40° off the ecliptic, the heliacal risings of the bright star [[Sirius]] occur over a "Sothic year" almost exactly synchronized with the [[solar year]].{{efn|The [[Sothic year]] is about a minute longer than a [[solar year]].&lt;ref name=teacosy&gt;{{harvp|Tetley|2014|p=[http://www.egyptchronology.com/uploads/2/6/9/4/26943741/ch_3_investigating_ancient_egyptian_calendars.pdf 42]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Since the development of [[civilization]], this has occurred at [[Cairo]] on July 19 on the [[Julian calendar]].&lt;ref name=lavia/&gt;{{efn|The exact date varies with [[latitude]], so that Sirius's return is observed about 8–10 days later on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast than at [[Elephantine|Aswan]].&lt;ref name=teatime&gt;{{citation |last=Tetley |first=M. Christine |title=The Reconstructed Chronology of the Egyptian Kings, ''Vol. I'' |url=http://www.egyptchronology.com/vols-1--2.html |date=2014 |p=[http://www.egyptchronology.com/uploads/2/6/9/4/26943741/ch_3_investigating_ancient_egyptian_calendars.pdf 43] }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Official observations were made at [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] or [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] near [[Cairo]], [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], and [[Elephantine]] near [[Aswan]].&lt;ref name=teatime/&gt; The date at any location also slowly varies within the [[Gregorian calendar]], owing to its omission of three leap years every four centuries. It presently occurs on 3 August.&lt;ref name=lavia&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.lavia.org/english/archivo/egyptiancalendaren.html |contribution=Ancient Egyptian Civil Calendar |title=La Via |url=http://www.lavia.org/indexIT.html |accessdate=8 February 2017 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Its returns also roughly corresponded to the onset of the [[flooding of the Nile|annual flooding]] of the [[Nile]] before it was ended by the [[Aswan Low Dam|Aswan Low]] and [[Aswan High Dam|High Dams]]. The [[ancient Egypt]]ians appear to have constructed their 365-day [[Egyptian calendar|civil calendar]] at a time when Wep Renpet, its [[New Year]], corresponded with Sirius's return to the night sky.&lt;ref name=teacosy/&gt; Although this calendar's lack of [[leap year]]s caused the event to shift one day every four years or so, [[Egyptian astronomy|astronomical records]] of this displacement led to the discovery of the [[Sothic cycle]] and, later, the establishment of the more accurate [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Alexandrian calendar]]s.

The Egyptians also devised a method of telling the time at night based on the heliacal risings of 36 [[Decans|decan stars]], one for each 10° segment of the 360° circle of the zodiac and corresponding to the ten-day "weeks" of their civil calendar.

To the [[Māori people|Māori]] of [[New Zealand]], the [[Pleiades]] are called [[Matariki]], and their heliacal rising signifies the beginning of the new year (around June). The [[Mapuche]] of [[South America]] called the Pleiades ''Ngauponi'' which in the vicinity of the ''[[we tripantu]]'' (Mapuche new year) will disappear by the west, ''lafkenmapu'' or ''ngulumapu'', appearing at dawn to the East, a few days before the birth of new life in nature. Heliacal rising of Ngauponi, i.e. appearance of the Pleiades by the horizon over an hour before the Sun approximately 12 days before the winter solstice, announced ''we tripantu''.

When a planet has a heliacal rising, there is a [[Conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]] with the sun beforehand. Depending on the type of conjunction, there may be a [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]], [[eclipse]], [[Transit (astronomy)|transit]], or [[occultation]] of the sun.

==Rising at sunset==
The rising of a planet above the eastern horizon at [[sunset]] is called its ''acronychal rising'', which for a [[superior planet]] signifies an [[opposition (planets)|opposition]], another type of [[syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]]. 

When the Moon has an acronychal rising, it will occur near [[full moon]] and thus, in a small number of cases, a noticeable [[lunar eclipse]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11666">The '''International Critical Commentary''' (or '''ICC''') is a series of commentaries in English on the text of the [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]]. It is currently published by the [[T&amp;T Clark]].

Initially started over one hundred years ago, the International Critical Commentary series has been a highly regarded academic level commentary on the bible. It aims to marshall all available aids to exegesis; linguistic, textual, archaeological, historical, literary and theological. No unifying scheme is sought but each scholar has been free to express their expertise.&lt;ref name=TTC&gt;{{cite web|title=Current publisher's introduction|work=bloomsbury.com|url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/series/international-critical-commentary/|access-date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ICCReview&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of the series|work=readingacts.com|url=http://readingacts.com/2011/08/23/more-free-books-the-international-critical-commentary-icc/|access-date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally edited by [[Samuel Rolles Driver]], [[Alfred A. Plummer]], and [[Charles Augustus Briggs]] the series has been in the hands of various editors since.
[[Graham Stanton]] was General Editor of the International Critical Commentaries (from 1984 until 2009).

The ''Liber introductorius'' is the collective title for the divination-centered trilogy written by [[Michael Scot]].&lt;ref name=resnickpage /&gt; The ''Liber introductorius'' is an encyclopedia dedicated to [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]].

The second is the ''Liber particularis'' (''The Singular Book''). The third and final volume is the ''[[Liber physiognomiae]]'', which concerns [[physiognomy]].&lt;ref name=resnickpage&gt;Resnick 2012, p. 15, note 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Male expendability''' is the idea that society can better cope with the loss of a typical man than with the loss of a typical woman.

[[Øystein Gullvåg Holter]] argues that the male-led Russian government's belief in male expendability contributed to their delay in seeking international help during the [[Kursk submarine disaster]], in which an all-male crew was lost. He notes, "If 118 women had been killed, alarm bells regarding discrimination against women would probably have gone off around the world." He notes that able-bodied males were viewed as a more legitimate target during wars in [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]], [[Kosovan War|Kosovo]], [[Timorese War|Timor]], [[Rwandan War|Rwanda]], and [[Second Chechen War|Chechnya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holter |first=Øystein Gullvåg |authorlink=Øystein Gullvåg Holter |title=A theory of gendercide |journal=[[Journal of Genocide Research]] |date=March 2002 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=11–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ivana Milojević notes that while patriarchy assigns the role of [[sex object]] to women, it assigns to men the role of violence-object, with male expendability being corollary to the sexual objectification of girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ivana Milojević |title=Why the Creation of a Better World is Premised on Achieving Gender Equity and on Celebrating Multiple Gender Diversities |journal=[[Journal of Futures Studies]] |date=June 2012 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=51–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films such as ''[[They Were Expendable]]'' or ''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]'' often are about all-male combat teams. Michael D. Clark notes that [[Adolf Hitler]] considered gay men expendable by means of [[Nazi concentration camps]] and [[Nazi medical experiments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=J. Michael |title=From Gay Men's Lives: Toward a More Inclusive, Ecological Vision |journal=[[The Journal of Men's Studies]] |date=May 1993 |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=347–358}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manosphere]] critics of feminism have argued that poor and working-class men "are cannon fodder abroad and expendable labor at home, trapped beneath a glass floor in jobs nobody really wants—farm workers, roofers, garbage men—and injured at far higher rates than women".&lt;ref name="gq"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/mens-rights-activism-the-red-pill|author=[[Jeff Sharlet (writer)|Jeff Sharlet]] |date=February 3, 2014 |title=What Kind of Man Joins the Men's Rights Movement? |publisher=GQ |accessdate=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Block]] argues in ''The Case for Discrimination'' that male expendability is the result of women's being the bottleneck of reproductive capacity in a population. This theme was echoed in [[Warren Farrell]]'s ''[[The Myth of Male Power]]''.

In the Italian higher education system, the various [[:it:Accademia di belle arti|Academies of Fine Arts]] offer second level programs that lead to a "[[:it:Diploma accademico|Diploma Accademico]] di Secondo Livello in Arti Visive e Discipline dello Spettacolo" which translates to "Masters in Visual and Performing Arts". The degree bears this name regardless of whether the discipline studied was in the Visual Arts or the Performing Arts. This credential is thus equivalent if the discipline studied was a Performing Arts discipline.

'''Mitigated speech''' is a [[linguistic]] term describing deferential or indirect speech inherent in communication between individuals of perceived [[Geert Hofstede|High Power Distance]] which has been in use for at least two decades with many published references.&lt;ref&gt;Ng, Sik H. and Bradac, James J. : ''Power in Language: Verbal Communication and Social Influence (Language and Language Behavior)''  Sage Publications, Inc (May 25, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, William Peter and Tajfel, Henri: [https://books.google.com/books?id=toHSl37qbfMC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=Ng++Bradac+Power+in+Language&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o27ICSXtLK&amp;sig=tHbmqXj0s68-p-ye1JD9ereSDjs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gZTQSdGMCs6dkAXf9-jZCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA193,M1 Social Groups and Identities] Routledge (1996) Retrieved 2009-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kasper, Gabriele and Blum-Kulka, Shoshana: [https://books.google.com/books?id=QAsbd2oi7LMC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=%22mitigated+speech%22+linguistics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UbqYXTVmQU&amp;sig=VrYIEFLQ8TkAo9UnsZS70QHJKRA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7pPQScSEJ4iMkAWllOTjCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result" Interlanguage Pragmatics] Oxford (1993). Retrieved 2009-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Hare, D., and Roscoe, S. ''Flightdeck performance - the human factor''. Ames: Iowa State University Press (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was popularized by  [[Malcolm Gladwell]] in his book, ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]'', where he defines mitigated speech as "any attempt to downplay or sugarcoat the meaning of what is being said".&lt;ref&gt;Gladwell, Malcolm: ''Outliers: The Story of Success'', Penguin (2008) p.194&lt;/ref&gt; He continues with reference to Fischer and Orasanu,&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Ute and Orasanu, Judith: ''Cultural Diversity and Crew Communication'', paper presented at Astronautical Congress, Amsterdam; American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; to describe 6 degrees of mitigation with which we make suggestions to authority: 

# '''Command''' – "Strategy X is going to be implemented" 
# '''Team Obligation Statement'''  – "We need to try strategy X" 
# '''Team Suggestion''' – "Why don't we try strategy X?" 
# '''Query''' – "Do you think strategy X would help us in this situation?" 
# '''Preference''' – "Perhaps we should take a look at one of these Y alternatives" 
# '''Hint''' – "I wonder if we could run into any roadblocks on our current course" 

Gladwell brings up the concept in the context of how crews relate to each other in the cockpit of a commercial airliner, graphically illustrating the degree to which mitigated speech can be detrimental in high-risk situations which require clear communication.

'''Optical lift''' is an [[optics|optical]] analogue of [[aerodynamic lift]], in which a [[Camber (aerodynamics)|cambered]] refractive object with differently shaped top and bottom surfaces experiences a stable transverse lift force when placed in a uniform stream of [[light]].&lt;ref name='Nature Photonics'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Stable optical lift | journal = Nature Photonics | volume = 5 | pages = 48 | date = 5 December 2010 | first = Grover A. | last = Swartzlander Jr | author2 = Timothy J.

== Discovery ==
[[File:Force components of optical lift, generated model.jpg|thumb|Optical lift is a component of force imparted from uniform light.]] [[File:First CP1 fabricated flying carpets.jpg|thumb|First CP1 fabricated flying carpets]] The ability of light to apply pressure to objects is known as [[radiation pressure]], which was first postulated in 1619 and proven in 1900.  This is the principle behind the [[solar sail]], which uses light [[radiation pressure]] to move through [[outer space|space]].  A 2010 study by physicist Grover Swartzlander and colleagues of the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] in Rochester, New York shows light is also capable of creating the more complex force of "[[lift (force)|lift]]", which is the force generated by [[airfoil]]s that make an airplane rise upwards as it travels forward. This study was published on December 2010 in ''[[Nature Photonics]]'' journal.  Swartzlander predicted, observed and experimentally verified at a micrometer-scale that when applying a beam of [[laser]] light to a semi-cylindrical refractive rod, it automatically torques into a stable [[angle of attack]], and then exhibits uniform [[Motion (physics)|motion]].&lt;ref name='Nature Photonics'/&gt;

The experiment began as [[computer model]]s that suggested when light is incident on a tiny object shaped like a [[wing]], a stable lift force is applied to the particle. Then the researchers decided to do physical experiments in the laboratory, and they created tiny, transparent, micrometer-sized rods that were flat on one side and rounded on the other, rather like airplane wings. They immersed the lightfoils in water and bombarded them with 130&amp;nbsp;mW [[infrared]] laser light from underneath the chamber. [[Radiation pressure]] pushes the particles along the direction of propagation, this is called the [[optical tweezers|scatter force]], but the excitement came when the particles were forced to the side in a direction perpendicular to the direction of propagating light.  The transverse force on the particles is the lift force.  The researchers discovered not only that the rods experienced stable lift, but that, depending on refractive index, the rod could have up to two stable angles of attack it rotated to when exposed to the laser light. Symmetrical spheres tested did not exhibit this same lift effect.&lt;ref name='Physorg'&gt;{{cite news | first = Lin | last = Edwards | title = Optical lifting demonstrated for the first time | date = 7 December 2010 | url = http://www.physorg.com/news/2010-12-optical-video.html | work = Physorg | accessdate = 2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In optical lift, created by a "lightfoil", the lift is created within the transparent object as light shines through it and is [[refraction|refracted]] by its inner surfaces. In the lightfoil rods a greater proportion of light leaves in a direction perpendicular to the beam and this side therefore experiences a larger radiation pressure and hence, lift.&lt;ref name='Physorg'/&gt;

== Potential uses ==
[[File:Diagram of flying carpets on solar sail.jpg|thumb|Using optical lift to steer solar sails]] The 2010 discovery of stable optical lift is considered by some physicists to be "most surprising".&lt;ref name='BBC'/&gt; Unlike [[optical tweezers]], an intensity gradient is not required to achieve a transverse force. Many rods may therefore be lifted simultaneously in a single quasi-uniform beam of light. Swartzlander and his team propose using optical lift to power micromachines, transport microscopic particles in a liquid, or to help on self-alignment and steering of [[solar sails]],&lt;ref name='BBC'&gt;{{cite news | first = Jason | last = Palmer | title = 'Lightfoil' idea shows light can provide lift | date = 8 December 2010 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11927793 | work = BBC News | accessdate = 2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; a form of [[spacecraft propulsion]] for interstellar space travel. Solar sails are generally designed to harness light to "push" a spacecraft, whereas Swartzlander designed their lightfoil to lift in a perpendicular direction; this is where the idea of being able to steer a future solar sail spacecraft may be applied.&lt;ref name='Kaku'&gt;{{cite news | first = Michio | last = Kaku | title = Optical Lift May Allow Us to Steer Solar Sail Spacecrafts and Nano Devices | date = 7 December 2010 | url = http://bigthink.com/ideas/25305 | work = Big Think | accessdate = 2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swartzlander said the next step would be to test lightfoils in air and experiment with a variety of materials with different refractive properties, and with incoherent light.&lt;ref name='Physorg'/&gt;

'''''Paintings of Abanindranath Tagore''''' is a book on [[Abanindranath Tagore]]'s paintings by art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]].&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=9788189323097|title=Amazon.com: Paintings Of Abanindranath Tagore: R. Siva Kumar: Books|publisher=amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely considered as a landmark book in the Indian art scene that brings together a large corpus of [[Abanindranath]]'s work for the first time. It fulfils a glaring lacuna in the picture of this master of modern Indian art.

In the books [[R. Siva Kumar]] states, 'The social space that Abanindranath narrativized as an artist-flaneur is thus the subject of the Orientalist artist/writer read from the obverse. He reclaims the colonial subjects' right to narrate their stories that was arrogated to themselves by the colonial rulers and perpetuated by presenting their readings as 'objective'. Abanindranath reasserts this right by recasting the Nights ([[Arabian Nights]]), a text central to the Orientalist representation of the East, by urging us to read his act of imagination contrapuntally with the text authenticated by the Orientalist.'&lt;ref name="artnewsnviews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnewsnviews.com/view-article.php?article=abanindranath-tagore-a-reappraisal-&amp;iid=22&amp;articleid=556|title=Abanindranath Tagore: a reappraisal|publisher=artnewsnviews.com|accessdate=2014-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871–1951) is a singular figure in [[Modern Indian painting|Modern Indian Art]]. Having arrived on the [[Indian art]] scene with the first wave of nationalism, he was seen as father figure of nationalist art and modernism. Along with [[E. B. Havell]], [[Ananda Coomaraswamy|Coomaraswamy]], [[Sister Nivedita]] and other nationalists he brought an attitudinal change in the Indian response to traditional art. But his true contribution went beyond these. Trained under European artists initially, realism remained the underpinning of his work. But as a modernist at heart who was guided more by his sensibility than his training, he transformed the post Renaissance academic realism into which he was trained with his series of contacts with oriental art into something more supple and responsive to the imaginative flights of his mind. A post-Romantic in his sensibilities, he let his individualism triumph over his nationalism. Although he aligned with the nationalists in the early years of his career he transcended it very soon to develop something more akin to a [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelairian]] aesthetics of modernism with a subjective response to the world rather than an unmediated representation of things. His most impressive work, the Arabian Nights series painted in 1930, can be described as a look at his immediate world through the eyes of a [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelarian]] [[Flâneur|Flaneur]], with the stories of the Arabian Nights serving as a pre-text. Equally original as a writer, [[Abanindranath]] is a phenomenon whose import has not been fully grasped. Much of this has been due to the unfamiliarity with his work in the absence of easily accessible public collections and publications. The present book brings together a large body of his work for the first time in an attempt to fulfill a glaring lacuna in our picture of this early master of modern Indian art.&lt;ref name="pratikshanbooks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pratikshanbooks.com/booksonart/index.html|title=Pratikshan :: Books in Books On Art|publisher=pratikshanbooks.com|accessdate=2014-12-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302123621/http://www.pratikshanbooks.com/booksonart/index.html|archivedate=2014-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has also influenced other books and researches on [[Abanindranath Tagore]]. [[Ananya Vajpeyi]] in her ''Righteous Republic: The Political Foundations of Modern India'' highlights the contribution of [[R. Siva Kumar]]'s ''Paintings of Abanindranath Tagore'' in foregrounding [[Abanindranath Tagore]]'s  art anew.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Righteous Republic: The Political Foundations of Modern India|author=Vajpeyi, A.|date=2012|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674067288|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=knCDsvJYy1EC|page=279|accessdate=2014-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1573">Within the cells of some members of [[basidiomycete]] [[fungus|fungi]] are found microscopic structures called '''parenthesomes'''  or '''septal pore caps'''. They are shaped like [[Bracket#Parentheses ( )|parentheses]] and found on either side of pores in the [[dolipore septum]] which separates cells within a [[hypha]].  Their function has not been established, and their composition has not been fully elucidated.  The variations in their appearance are useful in distinguishing individual species.

Generally, they are barrel shaped, with an endoplasmic reticulum covering.

The plant-based vaccine production method works by isolating a specific antigen protein, one that triggers a human immune response from the targeted virus. A gene from the protein is transferred to bacteria, which are then used to “infect” plant cells.

[[File:Platform Supply Vessel.JPG|thumb|right|Platform Supply Vessel]]
A '''Platform supply vessel''' (often abbreviated as PSV) is a ship specially designed to supply offshore [[oil platform|oil and gas platform]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Platform Supply Vessels|url=http://www.emas.com/index.php/our-expertise/emas-marine/our-fleet-2/platform-supply-vessels/|publisher=[[EMAS (company)|EMAS]]|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ships range from 50 to 100 meters in length and accomplish a variety of tasks. The primary function for most of these vessels is logistic support and transportation of goods, tools, equipment and personnel to and from offshore oil platforms and other offshore structures.
In the recent years a new generation of Platform Supply Vessel entered the market, usually equipped with Class 1 or Class 2 [[Dynamic Positioning]] System.

They belong to the broad category of offshore vessels (OSVs) that include platform supply vessels (PSV's), Crane vessels (C/V) and [[Well stimulation|Well stimulation vessels]] (WSVs), [[Anchor handling tug supply vessel]]s (AHTSVs) and Offshore construction vessels (OCVs). Larger offshore vessels have extensive sophisticated equipment including [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]]s and tend to accommodate a larger number of people (more than 100)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=About the Norshore Atlantic|url=http://www.ship-technology.com/projects/norshore-atlantic-multi-purpose-drilling-vessel/|accessdate=25 September 2017|publisher=Offshore technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capabilities==

===Cargo===
[[File:AHTS 408A.jpg|thumb|Deck cargo]]
A primary function of a platform supply vessel is to transport supplies to the oil platform and return other cargoes to shore.  Cargo tanks for [[drilling mud]], pulverized cement, diesel fuel, potable and non-potable water, and chemicals used in the drilling process comprise the bulk of the cargo spaces. Fuel, water, and chemicals are almost always required by oil platforms.  Certain other chemicals must be returned to shore for proper recycling or disposal, however, crude oil product from the rig is usually not a supply vessel cargo.

===Support===
Common and specialty tools are carried on the large decks of these vessels.  Most carry a combination of deck cargoes and bulk cargo in tanks below deck.  Many ships are constructed (or re-fitted) to accomplish a particular job. Some of these vessels are equipped with a firefighting capability and [[fire monitor]]s for fighting platform fires. Some vessels are equipped with oil containment and recovery equipment to assist in the cleanup of a spill at sea.  Other vessels are equipped with tools, chemicals and personnel to "work-over" existing oil wells for the purpose of increasing the wells' production.

==Vessel crews==
[[File:Northern-Genesis.jpg|thumb|The Norwegian PSV ''Northern Genesis'' in [[Bergen]] harbour]]

Crew on these ships can number up to 36 crew members, depending on the size, working area and whether DP equipped or not. Crane vessels and drill ships often have 100 to 200 people on board including a dedicated "Project team".

===Daily operations===
Crews sign on to work and live aboard the ship an extended period of time (4 – 6 weeks). This is followed by similar period of time off, often depending on the ship owner / operator the number of weeks or months aboard, specially this period the Companies due to lack of Offshore projects could ask to remain on board from 1 to 3 months, and after this trip 1 month off. Work details on platform supply vessels, like many ships, are organized into shifts of up to 12 hours.

Living aboard the ship, each crew member and worker will have at least 12 hour shift, lasting some portion of a 24-hour day. Supply vessels are provided with a "bridge" area for navigating and operating the ship, machinery spaces, living quarters, and galley and mess room. Some have built in work areas, and common areas for entertainment. The large main deck area is sometimes utilized for portable housing.

Living quarters consist of cabins, lockers, offices and spaces for storing personal items. Living areas are provided with wash basins, showers and toilets.

The [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]] or cooking and eating areas aboard ship will be stocked with enough grocery items to last for the intended voyage but with ability also to store provision for months if required. A walk-in size cooler and freezer, a commercial stove and oven, deep sinks, storage and counter space will be available for the persons doing the cooking. The eating area will have coffee makers, toasters, microwave ovens, cafeteria style seating, and other amenities needed to feed a hard working crew.

'''Political law''' (or '''political activity law'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capdale.com/political_activity_law/ |title=Caplin &amp; Drysdale's political activity law page |publisher=Capdale.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an established legal practice area encompassing the intersection of [[politics]] and [[law]].  Political law comprises [[election law]], [[suffrage|voting rights]] law, [[campaign finance]] law, laws governing [[lobbying]] and lobbyists, [[open government]] laws, legislative and executive branch [[ethical code|ethics codes]], [[parliamentary procedure|legislative procedure]], [[administrative law|administrative procedure]], [[constitutional law]], and legislative and regulatory drafting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161021001140/http://politicallawgroup.com/OurServices Political Law Group]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://econcordia.com/sites/IPPL/parliament.aspx?section=21 |title=Institute of Parliamentary and Political Law |publisher=Econcordia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312155927/http://econcordia.com/sites/IPPL/parliament.aspx?section=21 |archivedate=2012-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Political laws are applied primarily to government officials, candidates, [[advocacy group]]s, [[lobbying|lobbyists]], [[business]]es, [[nonprofit organization]]s, and [[trade union]]s.

At the federal level, the [[Federal Election Commission]] enforces campaign finance law with respect to races for the [[United States House of Representatives]], [[United States Senate]], and the office of [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Election Commission|FEC]]&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigns for federal office are subject to contribution limits and certain contributions are prohibited.  The [http://www.justice.gov/criminal/pin/ Department of Justice's Public Integrity Section (PIN)] has jurisdiction involving alleged criminal violations of many political laws.

At the state level, most states have administrative agencies to enforce state law with respect to campaign finance and ethics rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=15331/ |title=National Conference of State Legislatures list of state ethics commissions |publisher=Ncsl.org |date=2010-10-19 |accessdate=2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attorney general of the state may also play a role in enforcement. Some local governments also maintain ethics agencies. At the state and local level these agencies might simply provide for disclosure of campaign finance registration and reporting forms (or lobbyist registration and reporting), or they may provide an enforcement scheme.

"Pay-to-play" restrictions are an example of political law.  For instance, in the context of municipal securities dealers, rules promulgated by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board effectively prohibit certain individuals from contributing to the political funds of officials of issuers.&lt;ref&gt;Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board Rule G-37.

{{Postmodernism}}
{{Semiotics}}
'''Post-structuralism''', sometimes referred as the '''French theory''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17409292.2014.882655?journalCode=gsit20 "French Theory Revisited"].&lt;/ref&gt; is associated with the works of a series of mid-[[20th-century French philosophy|20th-century French]] [[continental philosophy|continental philosophers]] and [[critical theory|critical theorists]] who came to international prominence in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="Bensmaia05"&gt;Bensmaïa, Réda ''Poststructuralism'', article published in [[Lawrence D. Kritzman| Kritzman, Lawrence]] (ed.) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bREQibN9i-sC The Columbia History of Twentieth-Century French Thought]'', Columbia University Press, 2005, pp.92-93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Poster88"&gt;[[Mark Poster]] (1988) [https://books.google.com/books?id=-OnWAAAAMAAJ ''Critical theory and poststructuralism: in search of a context''], section ''Introduction: Theory and the problem of Context'', pp.5-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merquior1987"&gt;Merquior, J.&amp;nbsp;G. (1987). Foucault ([[Fontana Modern Masters]] series), University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520-06062-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is defined by its relationship to the system before it—[[structuralism]] (an intellectual movement developed in Europe from the early to mid-20th century). Structuralism proposes that one may understand human [[culture]] by means of a [[structure]]—modeled on language (i.e., [[structural linguistics]])—that differs from concrete [[reality]] and from abstract [[idea]]s—a "third order" that mediates between the two.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilles Deleuze| Deleuze, Gilles]]. 2002. "How Do We Recognise Structuralism?" In ''Desert Islands and Other Texts 1953-1974.'' Trans. David Lapoujade. Ed. Michael Taormina. Semiotext(e) Foreign Agents ser. Los Angeles and New York: Semiotext(e), 2004. 170-192. {{ISBN|1-58435-018-0}}. p.171-173.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Post-structuralist authors all present different critiques of structuralism, but common themes include the rejection of the self-sufficiency of structuralism and an interrogation of the [[binary opposition]]s that constitute its structures.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Edward, ed. 1998. ''Routledge Encyclopaedia of Philosophy.'' Vol. 7 (Nihilism to Quantum mechanics). London and New York: Routledge. {{ISBN| 0-415-18712-5}}. p.597.&lt;/ref&gt; Writers whose works are often characterised as post-structuralist include: [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Judith Butler]],  [[Jean Baudrillard]] and [[Julia Kristeva]], although many theorists who have been called "post-structuralist" have rejected the label.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Paul; 2006; "Post-structuralist Theories"; pp122-135 in Aitken, S. and Valentine, G. (eds); 2006; ''Approaches to Human Geography''; Sage, London&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Existential phenomenology]] is a significant influence; [[Colin Davis (philosopher) |Colin Davis]] has argued that post-structuralists might just as accurately be called "post-[[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologists]]".&lt;ref&gt;
Davis, Colin; "Levinas: An Introduction"; p8; 2006; Continuum, London.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==

Post-structuralist philosophers such as Derrida and Foucault did not form a self-conscious group, but each responded to the traditions of [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[structuralism]]. The idea that knowledge could be centred on the beholder is rejected by structuralism, which claims to be a more secure foundation for knowledge.&lt;ref name="Colebrook"&gt;Colebrook 2002, pp. 2-4&lt;/ref&gt; In phenomenology, this foundation is experiential in itself. In Structuralism, knowledge is founded on the "structures" that make experience possible: concepts, and language or signs. By contrast, Post-structuralism argues that founding knowledge either on pure experience (phenomenology) or systematic structures (Structuralism) is impossible. This impossibility was not meant as a failure or loss, but rather as a cause for "celebration and liberation".&lt;ref name="Colebrook" /&gt;

A major theory associated with structuralism is [[binary opposition]]. This theory proposes that there are frequently used pairs of opposite but related words (concepts), often arranged in a hierarchy. Examples of common binary pairs include: Enlightenment/Romantic, male/female, speech/writing, rational/emotional, signifier/signified, symbolic/imaginary. Post-structuralism rejects the notion of the dominant word in the pair being dependent on its [[:wikt:subservient|subservient]] counterpart. The only way to properly understand the purpose of these pairings is to assess each term individually, and then its relationship to the related term.{{clarify|date=June 2012}}

== Post-structuralism and structuralism ==
[[Structuralism]] was an intellectual movement in France in the 1950s and 1960s that studied the underlying structures in cultural products (such as texts) and used analytical concepts from linguistics, psychology, anthropology, and other fields to interpret those structures. It emphasized the logical and scientific nature of its results.

Post-structuralism offers a way of studying how knowledge is produced and critiques structuralist premises. It argues that because history and culture condition the study of underlying structures, both are subject to biases and misinterpretations. A post-structuralist approach argues that to understand an object (e.g., a text), it is necessary to study both the object itself and the systems of knowledge that produced the object.

=== Historical vs. descriptive view ===
Post-structuralists generally assert that post-structuralism is the historical context surrounding the arts, while structuralism is considered descriptive of the present.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} This terminology is derived from [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s distinction between the views of [[historical linguistics|historical (diachronic)]] and [[descriptive linguistics|descriptive (synchronic)]] reading. From this basic distinction, Post-structuralist studies often emphasize history to analyze descriptive concepts.  By studying how cultural concepts have changed over time, Post-structuralists seek to understand how the same concepts are understood by readers in the present. For example, Michel Foucault's ''[[Madness and Civilization]]'' is both an observation of history and an inspection of cultural attitudes about madness. The theme of history in modern [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] thought can be linked to such influences as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'' and [[Martin Heidegger]]'s ''[[Being and Time]].

=== Scholars between both movements ===
The uncertain distance between structuralism and post-structuralism is further blurred by the fact that scholars rarely label themselves as Post-structuralists. Some scholars associated with structuralism, such as [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Michel_Foucault|Foucault]], also became noteworthy in Post-structuralism.

===Controversy===
Some observers from outside the post-structuralist camp have questioned the rigor and legitimacy of the field. American philosopher [[John Searle]]&lt;ref&gt;Searle, John. (1990). "[http://www.ditext.com/searle/searle1.html The Storm Over the University]," in The [[New York Times Review of Books]], 6 December 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; argued in 1990 that "The spread of 'poststructuralist' literary theory is perhaps the best known example of a silly but non-catastrophic phenomenon." Similarly, physicist [[Alan Sokal]]&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Alan. (1997) "[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/le_monde_english.html Professor Latour's Philosophical Mystifications]," originally published in French in ''[[Le Monde]]'', 31 January 1997; translated by the author.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1997 criticized "the postmodernist/poststructuralist gibberish that is now [[hegemonic]] in some sectors of the American academy." Literature scholar Norman Holland argued that Post-structuralism was flawed due to reliance on Saussure's linguistic model, which was seriously challenged by the 1950s and was soon abandoned by linguists: "Saussure's views are not held, so far as I know, by modern linguists, only by literary critics and the occasional philosopher. [Strict adherence to Saussure] has elicited wrong film and literary theory on a grand scale. One can find dozens of books of literary theory bogged down in signifiers and signifieds, but only a handful that refer to [[Chomsky]]."&lt;ref&gt;Holland, Norman N. (1992) The Critical I, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|0-231-07650-9}}, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

David Foster Wallace wrote:
{{quote|The deconstructionists ("deconstructionist" and "poststructuralist" mean the same thing, by the way: "poststructuralist" is what you call a deconstructionist who doesn't want to be called a deconstructionist)&amp;nbsp;... see the debate over the ownership of meaning as a skirmish in a larger war in Western philosophy over the idea that presence and unity are ontologically prior to expression. There’s been this longstanding deluded presumption, they think, that if there is an utterance then there must exist a unified, efficacious presence that causes and owns that utterance. The poststructuralists attack what they see as a post-Platonic prejudice in favor of presence over absence and speech over writing. We tend to trust speech over writing because of the immediacy of the speaker: he's right there, and we can grab him by the lapels and look into his face and figure out just exactly what one single thing he means. But the reason why poststructuralists are in the literary theory business at all is that they see writing, not speech, as more faithful to the metaphysics of true expression. For Barthes, Derrida, and Foucault, writing is a better animal than speech because it is iterable; it is iterable because it is abstract; and it is abstract because it is a function not of presence but of absence: the reader’s absent when the writer’s writing, and the writer's absent when the reader's reading. 

For a deconstructionist, then, a writer's circumstances and intentions are indeed a part of the "context" of a text, but context imposes no real cinctures on the text's meaning, because meaning in language requires a cultivation of absence rather than presence, involves not the imposition but the erasure of consciousness. This is so because these guys–Derrida following Heidegger and Barthes Mallarme and Foucault God knows who–see literary language as not a tool but an environment. A writer does not wield language; he is subsumed in it. Language speaks us; writing writes; etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://biblioklept.org/2010/12/22/david-foster-wallace-defines-poststructuralism/|title=David Foster Wallace Describes Poststructuralism|last=Biblioklept|date=2010-12-22|website=Biblioklept|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== History ==
Post-structuralism emerged in [[France]] during the 1960s as a movement critiquing [[structuralism]]. According to [[José Guilherme Merquior|J.&amp;nbsp;G. Merquior]]&lt;ref name="Merquior1987"/&gt; a [[love–hate relationship]] with structuralism developed among many leading French thinkers in the 1960s.

In a 1966 lecture "[[Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences]]", Jacques Derrida presented a thesis on an apparent rupture in intellectual life. Derrida interpreted this event as a "decentering" of the former intellectual cosmos. Instead of progress or divergence from an identified centre, Derrida described this "event" as a kind of "play."

In 1967, Barthes published [[Death of the author|"The Death of the Author"]] in which he announced a metaphorical event: the "death" of the author as an authentic source of meaning for a given text. Barthes argued that any literary text has multiple meanings, and that the author was not the prime source of the work's semantic content.  The "Death of the Author," Barthes maintained, was the "Birth of the Reader," as the source of the proliferation of meanings of the text.
 
The period was marked by the rebellion of students and workers against the state in May 1968.

== Major works ==

===Barthes and the need for metalanguage===
Barthes in his work, ''Elements of Semiology'' (1967), advanced the concept of the "[[metalanguage]]". A metalanguage is a systematized way of talking about concepts like meaning and grammar beyond the constraints of a traditional (first-order) language; in a metalanguage, symbols replace words and phrases. Insofar as one metalanguage is required for one explanation of first-order language, another may be required, so metalanguages may actually replace first-order languages.  Barthes exposes how this structuralist system is regressive; orders of language rely upon a metalanguage by which it is explained, and therefore [[deconstruction]] itself is in danger of becoming a metalanguage, thus exposing all languages and discourse to scrutiny. Barthes' other works contributed deconstructive theories about texts.

=== Derrida's lecture at Johns Hopkins ===
The occasional designation of Post-structuralism as a movement can be tied to the fact that mounting criticism of Structuralism became evident at approximately the same time that Structuralism became a topic of interest in universities in the United States. This interest led to a colloquium at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1966 titled "The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man", to which such French philosophers as Derrida, Barthes, and Lacan were invited to speak.

Derrida's lecture at that conference, "[[Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences|Structure, Sign, and Play in the Human Sciences]]", was one of the earliest to propose some theoretical limitations to Structuralism, and to attempt to theorize on terms that were clearly no longer structuralist.

The element of "play" in the title of Derrida's essay is often erroneously interpreted in a linguistic sense, based on a general tendency towards puns and humour, while [[social constructionism]] as developed in the later work of Michel Foucault is said to create play in the sense of strategic agency by laying bare the levers of historical change&lt;!--what are the "levers of historical change" specifically?--&gt;. Many see the importance of Foucault's work to be in its synthesis of this social/historical account of the operation of power (see [[governmentality]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Furthermore, many marketing practitioners are cited as saying that in order to create successful marketing strategies in the twenty-first century, "more creative thinking allied to an integrated approach to all communication activities are needed".&lt;ref name="tproctor-pg144"&gt;{{Cite book|title="Communication in postmodern integrated marketing",|last= Proctor |first= Tony |year=2002 |publisher=Corporate Communications: An International Journal, Vol. 7 Iss: 3|pages=144–154 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The origin of postmodern communication is linked to the development of communication theory.  As communication theory studies the technical process of information and the process of human communication,  postmodern communications are the newly created tools and marketplaces that allow these communications to happen.&lt;ref  name="mdainton-pg247"&gt;{{Cite book|title="Communication In Postmodern Integrated Marketing",|last1= Dainton |first1= Marianne |last2= Zellei |first2= Elain | year=2011 |publisher=Sage Publications.|page= 247 |isbn= 1-4129-7691-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most thinking around the postmodern communication and marketing model is driven from an early 90's scholastic journal article created by Stephen Brown and posted to the England Journal of Marketing.&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg31"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Postmodern Marketing?|last=Brown |first=Steven |year=1993 |publisher=European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 27 Iss: 4|pages=19–34 |issn=0309-0566 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In it Brown writes, one who approaches marketing from postmodern style should in many ways reject attempts to impost order and working in silos.  Instead markers should work collectively from with artistic attributes of intuition, creativity, spontaneity, speculation, emotion and involvement.&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg31"/&gt;

== Postmodern Communication Models ==
With the raise of the internet in the early 1960s and the explosive growth of social networking and mobile phones in the 1980 era, many more tactical postmodern communication models have from.  Below is a short list on these new emerging messaging/communication models.

In adherence with postmodern communications one can assume that the current trend around marketing communication is within the real time model.  Although this may be the case it is important to realize that these communication models do not accurately depict how brands and advertisers are spending in the space. According to leading advertising spending and research provider, spending around new aged "response" media is set at around 20% of total media spend, while unidirectional models make up roughly 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emarketer.com/PressRelease.aspx?R=1008432 |title= Online Advertising Market Poised to Grow 20% in 2011 |publisher=emarketer.com |date=2011-06-08 |accessdate=2011-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Project Cost Management (PCM)''' is a method that uses technology to measure cost and productivity through the full life cycle of enterprise level projects.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

PCM encompasses several specific functions of [[project management]] including [[Estimation (project management)|estimating]], job controls, field data collection, [[Schedule (project management)|scheduling]], accounting and design.
PCM main goal is to complete a project within an approved budget&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=College|first1=Kathy Schwalbe, Ph.D., PMP, Augsburg|title=Information technology project management|date=2012|publisher=Course Technology|location=Boston, MA|isbn=9781133526858|edition=Seventh edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with estimating, a vital tool in PCM, actual historical data is used to accurately plan all aspects of the project.
As the project continues, job control uses data from the estimate with the information reported from the field to measure the cost and production in the project. From project initiation to completion, project cost management has an objective to simplify and cheapen the project experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1462">The '''Platinum-Cobalt Scale''' ('''Pt/Co scale''' or '''Apha-Hazen Scale''' ) is a color scale that was introduced in 1892 by chemist [[Allen Hazen]] (1869–1930). The index was developed as a way to evaluate [[pollution]] levels in waste water. It has since expanded to a common method of comparison of the intensity of yellow-tinted samples. It is specific to the color yellow and is based on dilutions of a 500 [[Parts per million|ppm]] platinum cobalt solution.

The '''Rowland Institute for Science''' was founded by [[Edwin H. Land]], founder of [[Polaroid Corporation]], as a nonprofit, privately endowed basic research organization in 1980. It is named for the first head of the [[American Physical Society]], [[Henry Augustus Rowland]].  The Rowland is dedicated to experimental science across a wide range of disciplines. Research subjects at the institute includes chemistry, physics and biology, and focuses on interdisciplinary work and the development of new experimental tools.

The institute merged with [[Harvard University]] on July 1, 2002, and is now called ''The 'Rowland Institute at Harvard'''. It is located near [[Kendall Square]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and is a few miles away from the main campus.

[[Sex]] is influenced by water [[pollutants]] that are encountered in everyday life. These sources of water can range from the simplicity of a water fountain to the entirety of the oceans.  The pollutants within the water range from [[endocrine disruptor]] Chemicals (EDCs) in birth control to [[Bisphenol-A|Bisphenol-A (BPA)]]. Foreign substances such as chemical pollutants that cause an alteration of sex have been found in growing prevalence in the circulating waters of the world. These pollutants have affected not only humans, but also animals in contact with the pollutants.

==Endocrine disruptor chemicals==
Endocrine Disruptor Chemicals (EDCs) are a type of chemical that directly influences sex [[hormones]].&lt;ref name="Freydis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Freydis|title=Sex Hormone Pollution|url=http://www.holology.com/hormone.html|publisher=Holology: The Social Engineering Notebook|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have acquired these names due to the fact that they are [[Antiestrogen|anti-estrogens]] and [[Antiandrogen|anti-androgens]].&lt;ref name="Freydis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Freydis|title=Sex Hormone Pollution|url=http://www.holology.com/hormone.html|publisher=Holology: The Social Engineering Notebook|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By inhibiting the function of these hormones, [[fertility]] decreases, and an imbalance of such hormones has been shown to cause [[Feminization (biology)|feminizing effects]] in males.{{citation needed|reason=DM not a good source. A scientific publication is preferable|date=September 2013}} This is not only a human issue, but has become increasingly noticeable in fish populations worldwide.&lt;ref name="University of Exeter"&gt;{{cite journal|last=University Exeter|title=Declining Male Fertility Linked to Water Pollution|journal=ScienceDaily|date=18 January 2009|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090118200636.htm|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists believe that these chemicals present in the water supply leads to increasing feminizing effects in male fish.&lt;ref name="University of Exeter"&gt;{{cite journal|last=University Exeter|title=Declining Male Fertility Linked to Water Pollution|journal=ScienceDaily|date=18 January 2009|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090118200636.htm|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estrogen]]s accumulate in body fat and tissue, and because of the cycle of the food chain, the artificial estrogens/EDC’s bioaccumulate as they rise up the different levels of the food chain.

EDCs are present in the environment, whether naturally or artificially.&lt;ref name="Freydis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Freydis|title=Sex Hormone Pollution|url=http://www.holology.com/hormone.html|publisher=Holology: The Social Engineering Notebook|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the EDCs from birth control are obviously causing a great effect on the humans, it turns out that, in the United States, the estrogens given to livestock are even more prevalent.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=Kirsten|author2=Kimberly Inez McGuire |author3=Rivka Gordon |author4=Tracey Woodruff |title=Birth Control Hormones in Water: Separating Myth from Fact|journal=Contraception|date=August 2011|volume=84|issue=2|pages=115–118|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2011.04.014|pmid=21757050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pollutants and their source of origin==

===Pharmaceuticals===

Sex-altering pollutants come from many sources. One source that is becoming more visible is water pollution through [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]]. Pharmaceutical products may contain microscopic pollutants that imitate the chemical structure of hormones found in living organisms. These compounds are called Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals. They usually mimic the chemical structures of estrogens and androgens.&lt;ref&gt;1. Endocrine Disruptors: Characteristics [Internet]. [cited 2017 May 8]. Available from: http://enhs.umn.edu/current/5103/endocrine/character.html&lt;/ref&gt; The sources of these artificial EDCs are surprisingly common in human production and usage of many household and industrial products. For example, EDCs such as parabens, phthalates, and triclosans can be found in everyday household items such as generic shampoos, conditioners, soaps, perfumes, makeup, and lotions. EDCs are either applied to the skin and are absorbed, ingested and then excreted in urine, or are washed off in the shower or sink and have been documented in multiple water analyses.  Below are some of the most commonly tested, used, and analyzed EDCs found in pharmaceuticals and personal care products:

*Parabens: inhibit the growth of yeasts, molds, and bacteria in cosmetic products and can be found in deodorants, facial scrubs, make up, lotions, and cleansers. Parabens are also an estrogen mimicker and are chemically the same structure.
*Phthalates: Phthalates are used in cosmetics as “plasticizing” agents to make a substance more pliable such as in fingernail polish and hairspray. They act as estrogen and bind to receptors in the cell to induce estrogenic activity within an organism.
*Triclosans: operate as antimicrobials and can be found in toothpaste, cosmetic products, and many soaps. Triclosans exhibit behaviors that are representative of estrogen and androgen, working in a complex nature to interact with both hormonal receptors

Aside from these microscopic EDCs, some of the other more common types of pharmaceuticals found in water analyses are “[[Antidepressant|anti-depressants]], [[Anticonvulsant|anti-seizure drugs]], and one that is very well known: birth control.”&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=Kirsten|author2=Kimberly Inez McGuire |author3=Rivka Gordon |author4=Tracey Woodruff |title=Birth Control Hormones in Water: Separating Myth from Fact|journal=Contraception|date=August 2011|volume=84|issue=2|pages=115–118|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2011.04.014|pmid=21757050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry and farming===

However, pharmaceuticals are not the largest contributor to the growing amount of gender-altering pollution in the water. Scientists at the [[University of California, San Francisco|University of California San Francisco (UCSF)]] stated that there are many other sources of chemicals like the ones found in various pharmaceuticals that produce the same effects.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=Kirsten|author2=Kimberly Inez McGuire |author3=Rivka Gordon |author4=Tracey Woodruff |title=Birth Control Hormones in Water: Separating Myth from Fact|journal=Contraception|date=August 2011|volume=84|issue=2|pages=115–118|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2011.04.014|pmid=21757050}}&lt;/ref&gt; “[[Fertilizer|Crop fertilizers]] along with [[Dairy cattle|dairy cows]], and various industrial chemicals like BPA” are increasingly seen as a source for pollution causing certain specific effects in those who consume them or products that are manufactured from them.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=Kirsten|author2=Kimberly Inez McGuire |author3=Rivka Gordon |author4=Tracey Woodruff |title=Birth Control Hormones in Water: Separating Myth from Fact|journal=Contraception|date=August 2011|volume=84|issue=2|pages=115–118|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2011.04.014|pmid=21757050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically shifting to industrial chemicals, when they, along with other products containing these chemicals, are disposed of, they end up in [[landfill]]s.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=Kirsten|author2=Kimberly Inez McGuire |author3=Rivka Gordon |author4=Tracey Woodruff |title=Birth Control Hormones in Water: Separating Myth from Fact|journal=Contraception|date=August 2011|volume=84|issue=2|pages=115–118|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2011.04.014|pmid=21757050}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Surface runoff|Runoff]] from said landfills eventually finds its way to a larger source of water and the contamination begins.

===Fossil fuels and organics===

Another source from which pollutants originate is [[Fossil fuel|fossil-fuel]] combustion.&lt;ref name="Doney"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Doney|first=Scott|title=The Growing Human Footprint on Coastal and Open-Ocean Biogeochemistry|journal=Science|date=18 June 2010|volume=328|issue=5985|pages=1512–1516|doi=10.1126/science.1185198|pmid=20558706|bibcode=2010Sci...328.1512D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Persistent organic pollutant|organic pollutants]] and [[trace metal]]s released into the air from this combustion end up in the oceans and influence the chemistry of the ocean. One specific process that has a great impact on the global [[nitrogen cycle]] which affects ocean climate, the [[Haber process|Haber-Bosch process]], is used for an agricultural fertilizer.&lt;ref name="Doney"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Doney|first=Scott|title=The Growing Human Footprint on Coastal and Open-Ocean Biogeochemistry|journal=Science|date=18 June 2010|volume=328|issue=5985|pages=1512–1516|doi=10.1126/science.1185198|pmid=20558706|bibcode=2010Sci...328.1512D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humans===

There are also humans. The chemicals that alter gender are constantly produced and excreted by a human being on a normal everyday basis. Along with this, pregnant women contain greater amounts of the chemicals thus releasing greater amounts of it with every excretion.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=Kirsten|author2=Kimberly Inez McGuire |author3=Rivka Gordon |author4=Tracey Woodruff |title=Birth Control Hormones in Water: Separating Myth from Fact|journal=Contraception|date=August 2011|volume=84|issue=2|pages=115–118|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2011.04.014|pmid=21757050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, one can see that the source of gender-altering pollutants is not natural, but due to man-made chemicals that, globally, are being released.

==Circulation of pollutants==
Chemicals such as EDC's and artificial estrogens are in constant circulation around the planet through a variety of mediums. Humans have become a main contributor to the toxic buildup of these chemicals in our ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Brett, Tricia. The Fate of Estron (E1), 17beta-Estradiol (E2), Estriol (E3), and 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in Surface Waters. Diss. University of British Columbia, Okanagan, 2014. Online.&lt;/ref&gt; Main sources of drinking water, such as rivers, lakes, streams, and eventually the ocean are just a few of such mediums that carry these chemicals from place to place. Most chemical exposure to impoverished people around the world who live in rural areas is linked to their exposure to polluted water sources.&lt;ref name="Carvalho"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carvalho|first=Suely|title=Gender Mainstreaming Guidance Series: Chemicals and Gender|year=2011|publisher=UNDP Environment and Energy Group|pages=1–27|url=http://www.gender-climate.org/Content/Docs/Publications/UNDP_2011ChemicalGender.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of the EDCs entering the water source all begins with a source. Whether it comes from an [[Factory|industrial plant]], pharmaceutical, or human source, it eventually finds its way to a larger water source, usually in the form of a waste product. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)]] has documented the amount of pharmaceuticals released into the environment from manufacturing plants, however, this documentation is not as prevalent on a household level.&lt;ref name="Dean"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dean|first=Cornelia|title=Drugs Are in the Water. Does It Matter?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/03/science/earth/03water.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=20 March 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some on-going efforts to attempt to minimize this pollution. For example, 80 percent of [[Pharmacy|pharmacies]] in [[Clark County, Washington]] have contributed to efforts emphasizing the safe disposal of noncontrolled drugs.&lt;ref name="Dean"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dean|first=Cornelia|title=Drugs Are in the Water. Does It Matter?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/03/science/earth/03water.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=20 March 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to control water pollution are gaining support as pollution gradually becomes more visible. However, these efforts are still in the process of being implemented on a large scale. The polluted water is then sent to a number of places.

===Waste management===

One possibility is that the water is sent to a waste management facility to be treated and then recirculated. However, experts have found that sewage treatment does not remove these chemicals completely from drinking supplies. Any type of water that is flushed down the shower, toilet, or sink usually carries with it some sort of EDC. These drains lead to pipes that lead to a waste water management plant. A typical waste water treatment plant involves a multiple step process of water cleaning but due to the microscopic size of EDC particles, it usually isn't a 100% successful process. For example, Boulder, Colorado Waste Water Management receives water in inceptor pipes, which lead into larger holding pools at the facility. The typical treatment usually lasts between 12 and 24 hours and consists of three main treatment processes. First, physical treatments remove solid and organic materials from the waste water. Then, microbiological treatments follow. Bacteria in these waste tanks feed on carbon and nitrogenous compounds left in the sewage. And finally, the water is treated with ultraviolet blue light to disinfect the remaining water. The effluent water is feed back into local creeks, streams, and freshwater resources. This basic waste water treatment plan is effective in targeting larger contaminants, however, it is ineffective in removing microscopic EDCs.&lt;ref&gt;1. Water Education [Internet]. [cited 2017 May 8]. Available from: https://bouldercolorado.gov/water/water-education&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, EDC micro-pollution is causing a toxic buildup of chemical soups in freshwater habitats.&lt;ref&gt;"Wastewater Collection and Treatment The Foundation of Public Health." Wastewater Treatment. Web. 16 Apr. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to this, the [[water industry]] has stated that there is no evidence of a risk to overall health as a result of exposure to these chemicals.  However, the [[Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]] states in its review of water pollution that many contaminants survive wastewater treatment and [[biodegradation]], and are detectable in the environment. Therefore, the tainted source is recycled through a community, exposing more people and releasing more chemicals along the way.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Water cycle===

A second source of circulation is water as it follows its natural path through the [[water cycle]]. The water cycle, put simply, represents the path that water takes as it circulates around planet earth.&lt;ref name="Types"&gt;{{cite web|title=Types: Water Pollution|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C0111040/Types/water.php|publisher=Oracle ThinkQuest|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows a series of stages in which the water changes state multiple times until it finally falls back to earth where it will once again be circulated. In the water cycle, both organic and inorganic pollutants are biodegraded or filtered out whereas they no longer present much of a threat.&lt;ref name="Types"&gt;{{cite web|title=Types: Water Pollution|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C0111040/Types/water.php|publisher=Oracle ThinkQuest|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also true for small amounts of chemicals present in the water. However, when there are very large amounts of chemicals, organic or inorganic, present in the water as it cycles through the atmosphere, harmful effects can be seen in areas where this water falls as [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. This precipitation re-enters the ongoing circulation of water pollution.

===Ocean and marine life===

Another path in which the water can circulate is by flowing directly to the ocean. Pollutants are prevalent in coastal and open-ocean waters as contaminated water flows from point sources to the sea.&lt;ref name="Doney"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Doney|first=Scott|title=The Growing Human Footprint on Coastal and Open-Ocean Biogeochemistry|journal=Science|date=18 June 2010|volume=328|issue=5985|pages=1512–1516|doi=10.1126/science.1185198|pmid=20558706|bibcode=2010Sci...328.1512D}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pollutants are then distributed globally due to the circulation of the ocean currents and [[Animal migration|migration]] of exposed marine life.&lt;ref name="Doney"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Doney|first=Scott|title=The Growing Human Footprint on Coastal and Open-Ocean Biogeochemistry|journal=Science|date=18 June 2010|volume=328|issue=5985|pages=1512–1516|doi=10.1126/science.1185198|pmid=20558706|bibcode=2010Sci...328.1512D}}&lt;/ref&gt; This becomes an explanation of how the chemicals, once again, find their way to a human consumer. Marine wildlife in a polluted area exists in and consumes contaminated water daily. When it is harvested, it has accumulated an amount of harmful chemicals/EDCs relatively high to that compared to ambient ocean levels.&lt;ref name="Doney"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Doney|first=Scott|title=The Growing Human Footprint on Coastal and Open-Ocean Biogeochemistry|journal=Science|date=18 June 2010|volume=328|issue=5985|pages=1512–1516|doi=10.1126/science.1185198|pmid=20558706|bibcode=2010Sci...328.1512D}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is then passed on to consumers of the seafood: humans, whereas the chemicals bioaccumulate in their bodies eventually causing sex-related health problems.

==Effects of pollutants on sex==
These chemicals have an effect on the sex of many humans because of constant exposure. The pollutants found in the water have been observed in many studies that produce concrete data describing the effects they have on the hormones in both males and females. Studies have been conducted on animals, but the observed trends are also associated with effects noticed in humans. Scientists observing EDCs in women’s blood found that these chemicals mimic human hormones and trigger changes in the [[Sex-determination system|sex-determining process]] of unborn children.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Paul|title=Man-Made chemicals blamed as many more girls than boys are born in Arctic|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/12/gender.sciencenews|accessdate=20 March 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scientists suggest that this hormonal influence on the sex-determining process has led to a decrease in the male/female ratio.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Paul|title=Man-Made chemicals blamed as many more girls than boys are born in Arctic|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/12/gender.sciencenews|accessdate=20 March 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other effects directly influencing the sex of an individual include a decrease in number and quality of sperm and increased deficiency in a male’s reproductive system.&lt;ref name="Carvalho"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carvalho|first=Suely|title=Gender Mainstreaming Guidance Series: Chemicals and Gender|year=2011|publisher=UNDP Environment and Energy Group|pages=1–27|url=http://zunia.org/uploads/media/knowledge/ChemicalGender_final1300876117.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically looking at the effects of EDCs on sperm, these chemicals cause a premature release of a chemical that the sperm cells use to penetrate the egg’s outer layer.&lt;ref name="Freydis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Freydis|title=Sex Hormone Pollution|url=http://www.holology.com/hormone.html|publisher=Holology: The Social Engineering Notebook|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results collected from a study help to explain why the sperm act the way they do. In respect to the deficiency of the male’s reproductive system, these chemicals begin affecting a male as early as birth. As the testes are developing, an occurrence taking place early in the development process, a specific type of cells, [[Sertoli cell]]s, differentiates.&lt;ref name="Freydis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Freydis|title=Sex Hormone Pollution|url=http://www.holology.com/hormone.html|publisher=Holology: The Social Engineering Notebook|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, exposure to an EDC such as [[Estrogen|oestrogen]] causes a reduction in Sertoli cells produced.&lt;ref name="Freydis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Freydis|title=Sex Hormone Pollution|url=http://www.holology.com/hormone.html|publisher=Holology: The Social Engineering Notebook|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction of Sertoli cells causes a decrease in the production of sperm thus rendering the male reproductive system less effective.&lt;ref name="Freydis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Freydis|title=Sex Hormone Pollution|url=http://www.holology.com/hormone.html|publisher=Holology: The Social Engineering Notebook|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; EDCs have also been linked to [[Precocious puberty|early puberty]], infertility, and developmental defects.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=Kirsten|author2=Kimberly Inez McGuire |author3=Rivka Gordon |author4=Tracey Woodruff |title=Birth Control Hormones in Water: Separating Myth from Fact|journal=Contraception|date=August 2011|volume=84|issue=2|pages=115–118|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2011.04.014|pmid=21757050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only have these effects been found in human subjects, but aquatic life has also been studied as these animals are in direct contact with EDCs as a part of their lifestyle. Populations of fish have been largely affected by EDC’s prevalence in their native ecosystems.

===Aquatic life===
*A study published in 2008 in Japan examined the effects of EDCs from personal care products on a local river biome. The effect of triclosan indicated the inhibition of growth of multiple species including algae, protozoa, crustaceans, bacteria, and amphibians.&lt;ref&gt;Janjua, Nadeem Rezaq, Hanne Frederiksen, Niels E. Skakkebaek, Hans Christian Wulf, and Anna Maria Andersson. "Urinary Excretion of Phthalates and Paraben after Repeatedwhole-body Topical Application in Humans." International Journal of Andrology 31 (2008): 118-30. Wiley Online Library. Web. 5 Apr. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Further evidence of EDC presence is revealed by surveys of freshwater, estuarine, and marine ecosystems that also pose great consequences to the health of fish. Estrogen and androgen mimickers create endocrine imbalances in fish populations that rely on hormone communication for reproduction and maturation. A build up of EDCs in streams, lakes, and rivers creates confusion in the hormone vitellogenin, the reproductive hormone in fish. According to a review published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, when fish were exposed to a variety of estrogen and androgen mimickers, vitellogenin communication was skewed yielding reduced egg production, skewed sex ratio, reduced male gonadosomatic index (sperm production), decreased sexual behavior in males and increased physical deformities in a variety of fish species.&lt;ref&gt;Lesley J. Mills, Clinton Chichester, Review of evidence: Are endocrine-disrupting chemicals in the aquatic environment impacting fish populations?, Science of the Total Environment, Volume 343, Issues 1–3, 1 May 2005, Pages 1-34, ISSN 0048-9697, https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2004.12.070.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solutions==

===Water Filtration Technology===

In an effort to better filter these trace pollutants out of effluent water leaving waste management plants, studies conducted by Westerhoff et. al
&lt;ref&gt;Westerhoff, Paul Ph.D., P.E. “Removal of Endocrine Disruptors, Pharmaceuticals, and Personal Care Products During Water Treatment” Southwest Hydrology November/December 2003: 18-19. Online PDF.&lt;/ref&gt; and Schafer et. al &lt;ref&gt;A.I. Schafer, T.D. Waite. “Removal of Endocrine disrupters in advanced treatment—the Australian approach.” Proceedings of the IWA World Water Congress, Workshop Endocrine Disrupters, IWA specialist group on assessment and control of hazardous substances in water (ACHSW), Melbourne (2002), pp. 37-51&lt;/ref&gt; explore the water filtration systems that are best at removal of EDC's from effluent waters. They found that Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC), membrane filtration (nonfiltration and biofiltration), and reverse osmosis were the best at removal EDC's.

*Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC): PAC is made from organic matter that has a high carbon content such as wood, coal, and coconuts. The carbon source is treated to have a large surface area with many microscopic pores and added in high content to water in the early stages of water treatment. The carbon absorbs toxins because of its molecular attraction and desire to adhere to organic charged molecules.
*Membrane filtration: Membrane filtration involves the use of organic and inorganic membranes that filter out different sized molecules based on molecular characteristics.
*Reverse Osmosis: reverse osmosis is similar to membrane filtration. It uses reverse osmotic pressure which encourages water to filter from high concentration of contamination to low concentrations of contamination through added pressure. The water is passed through a membrane that solely allows the passing of water, forcing contaminants and toxins to be rejected from the filtration process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3895">'''Ship launching airbags''' are specialized air bags that are used for [[Ceremonial ship launching|launching]] marine vessels. This method of launching ships is called [[Airbag launching|airbag launching]]. These air bags are made of synthetic-tire-cord reinforcement layers and rubber layers,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;ISO14409-Ships and marine technology of Ship launching air bags&lt;/ref&gt; and are also known as marine airbags. They were invented in 1980.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The first known use of marine airbags occurred on January 20, 1981 with the launch of a [[tank barge]] from the [[Xiao Qinghe]] [[shipyard]]. From then on, more and more shipyards, especially in [[China]] and [[Southeast Asia]], began to use air bags to launch small and medium-sized vessels.

In recent years, higher strength materials have been used in air bag production, allowing them to have much more bearing capacity. Hence, they have begun to be used at the launchings of larger vessels. In October 2011, the successful launch of one vessel with a [[deadweight tonnage]] (DWT) of 75000 tonnes set a world record for ship launches utilizing air bags.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The following year, on June 6, 2012, the ship "He Ming" ([[IMO number]] 9657105), with a DWT of 73541 tonnes, total length of 224.8m, breadth of 34m, and depth of 18.5m, also launched successfully using air bags&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=He Ming |url=https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:649866/mmsi:414124000/imo:9657105/vessel:HE_MING |website=MarineTraffic |accessdate=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Air bag structure ==

[[File:Airbag structure.pdf|centre|frameless|606x606px]]

Marine air bags consist of three parts:
# '''Air bag body''': the main, cylindrical part of the air bag after being fully inflated with compressed air,
# '''Air bag heads''': conical parts connecting the body and the mouths of the air bag, and
# '''Air bag mouths''': either metal valves mounted on both ends of the air bag for inflating with air or a valve on one end and a metal lug on the other end used to haul the air bag.

== Air bag size and model ==

=== Size ===
The diameter of an air bag varies; sizes include 0.8 m, 1.0 m, 1.2 m, 1.5 m, 1.8 m, etc.

The length of an air bag is specified by the customer when it is manufactured.

=== Model ===
Air bags are commonly divided into three to six tire-cord reinforcement layers. There can be more layers, though there are normally less than ten.

=== Air bag bearing capacity ===
The '''maximum load carrying capacity''' of an air bag, which is the maximum load under which it will suffer no permanent deformation or damage, can be found as follows:
[[File:An air bag being compressed.jpg|border|left]]

'''Let:'''

&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; be the original diameter of the air bag

&lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be the height of the compressed air bag

&lt;math&gt;W_{1}&lt;/math&gt; be the width of the air bag contacting the ship bottom

&lt;math&gt;P_{1}&lt;/math&gt; be the internal pressure of the air bag

&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be the effective length of the air bag

Given these variables,
&lt;math&gt;\text{bearing capacity} = P_{1} \times W_{1} \times L&lt;/math&gt;

=== Air bag materials ===
Ship launching air bags are constructed of synthetic-tire-cord layers; inner and outer rubber layers are sometimes added. All materials used are [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]].

== Air bag test ==

Air tightness test: Without carrying any load, fill the air bag till the internal pressure of the air bag reaches rated working pressure. After 1 hour. The pressure loss should be less than 5 % of initial pressure.

Bursting test： Fill the air bag with water until the air bag bursts. The water pressure at the time of bursting shall be no less than three times of rated working pressure&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

The '''sociology of health and illness''', alternatively the '''sociology of health and wellness''' (or simply '''health sociology'''), examines the interaction between [[society]] and [[health]]. The objective of this topic is to see how social life affects [[morbidity]] and [[mortality rate]], and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Timmermans, Stefan &amp; Steven Haas. Towards a sociology of disease. ''Sociology of Health and Illness'', Vol. 30, No. 5, pp. 659-676: 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect of sociology differs from [[medical sociology]] in that this branch of sociology discusses [[health]] and [[illness]] in relation to social institutions such as [[family]], [[employment]], and [[school]]. The sociology of [[medicine]] limits its concern to the patient-practitioner relationship and the role of health professionals in society.&lt;ref name="Conrad"&gt;{{cite book| last = Conrad| first = Peter| title = The Sociology of Health and Illness Critical Perspectives| url = https://books.google.com/?id=wYKWr2N19CgC| year = 2008| publisher = [[Macmillan Publishers]]| isbn = 978-1-4292-0558-0| pages = 1–55 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sociology of health and illness covers sociological pathology (causes of disease and illness), reasons for seeking particular types of medical aid, and patient compliance or noncompliance with medical regimes.&lt;ref name=Conrad/&gt;

Health, or lack of health, was once merely attributed to biological or natural conditions. Sociologists have demonstrated that the spread of diseases is heavily influenced by the socioeconomic status of individuals, ethnic traditions or beliefs, and other cultural factors.&lt;ref name=White/&gt; Where medical research might gather statistics on a disease, a sociological perspective on an illness would provide insight on what external factors caused the demographics who contracted the disease to become ill.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite book| last = White| first = Kevin| title = An introduction to the sociology of health and illness| url = https://books.google.com/?id=eZSmngEACAAJ| year = 2002| publisher = SAGE Publishing| isbn = 978-0-7619-6400-1| pages = 4–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This topic requires a global approach of analysis because the influence of societal factors varies throughout the world. This will be demonstrated through discussion of the major diseases of each continent. These diseases are sociologically examined and compared based on the [[traditional medicine]], [[economics]], [[religion]], and [[culture]] that is specific to each region. [[HIV/AIDS]] serves as a common basis of comparison among regions. While it is extremely problematic in certain areas, in others it has affected a relatively small percentage of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.unaids.org/pub/GlobalReport/2008/jc1510_2008_global_report_pp211_234_en.pdf |title=HIV and AIDS estimates and data |year=2007 |publisher=World Health Organization |pages=214–233 |accessdate=Dec 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociological factors can help to explain why these discrepancies exist.

There are obvious differences in patterns of health and illness across societies, over time, and within particular society types. There has historically been a long-term decline in mortality within [[industrialized]] societies, and on average, life-expectancies are considerably higher in [[developed]], rather than developing or [[undeveloped]], societies.&lt;ref name= Marshall/&gt; Patterns of global change in health care systems make it more imperative than ever to [[research]] and comprehend the sociology of health and illness. Continuous changes in economy, [[therapy]], [[technology]] and [[insurance]] can affect the way individual communities view and respond to the medical care available. These rapid fluctuations cause the issue of health and illness within social life to be very dynamic in definition&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility. Social Science &amp; Medicine. 
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037 &lt;/ref&gt;. Advancing information is vital because as patterns evolve, the study of the sociology of health and illness constantly needs to be updated.&lt;ref name=Conrad/&gt;

==Historical background==
[[File:Akmanthor.jpg|thumb|Wall painting found in the tomb of an Egyptian official known as the physicians tomb]]
Humans have long sought advice from those with knowledge or skill in [[healing]]. [[Paleopathology]] and other historical records, allow an examination of how ancient societies dealt with illness and [[outbreak]]. Rulers in Ancient Egypt sponsored physicians that were specialists in specific diseases.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; [[Imhotep]] was the first medical doctor known by name. An Egyptian who lived around 2650&amp;nbsp;B.C., he was an adviser to King Zoser at a time when Egyptians were making progress in medicine. Among his contributions to medicine was a textbook on the treatment of wounds, broken bones, and even [[tumors]].&lt;ref&gt;Saari, Peggy.

Stopping the spread of infectious disease was of utmost importance for maintaining a healthy society.&lt;ref name="Porter"&gt;{{cite book| last = Porter| first = Dorothy| title = Health, Civilization, and the state a history of public health from ancient to modern times| year = 1999| publisher = Routledge| location = New York NY| isbn = 978-0-415-12244-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The outbreak of [[disease]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]] was recorded by [[Thucydides]] who survived the [[epidemic]]. From his account it is shown how factors outside the disease itself can affect society. The Athenians were under siege and concentrated within the city. Major city centers were the hardest hit.&lt;ref name="Littman"&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Plague of Athens: Epidemiology and Paleopathology|last= Littman|first= Robert J.|year= 2009|publisher= Mount Sinai Journal of Medicine, Vol. 76, pp. 456-467.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made the outbreak even more deadly and with probable food shortages the fate of [[Athens]] was inevitable.&lt;ref name=Littman/&gt; Approximately 25% of the population died of the [[disease]].&lt;ref name=Littman/&gt; Thucydides stated that the [[epidemic]] "carried away all alike". The [[disease]] attacked people of different ages, sexes and nationalities.&lt;ref name=Littman/&gt;

Ancient medical systems stressed the importance of reducing illness through [[divination]] and ritual.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; Other codes of behavior and dietary protocols were widespread in the ancient world.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; During the [[Zhou Dynasty]] in China, doctors suggested exercise, meditation and [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]] to preserve one's health.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; The Chinese closely link health with spiritual well-being. Health regimes in ancient [[India]] focused on oral health as the best method for a healthy life.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; The  [[Talmud|Talmudic code]] created rules for health which stressed ritual cleanliness, connected disease with certain animals and created diets.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; Other examples include the [[Mosaic Code]] and [[Roman baths]] and [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]].&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt;

Those that were most concerned with health, sanitation and illness in the ancient world were those in the elite class.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; Good health was thought to reduce the risk of spiritual defilement and therefore enhanced the social status of the ruling class who saw themselves as the beacon of civilization.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; During the late Roman Period, sanitation for the lower classes was a concern for the leisured class.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; Those that had the means would donate to charities that focused on the health of non-elites.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; After the decline of the [[Roman Empire]], physicians and concern with public health disappeared except in the largest cities.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; Health and public doctors remained in the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; Focusing on preventing the spread of diseases such as [[small pox]] lead to a smaller mortality rate in much of the western world.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; Other factors that allowed the modern rise in population include: better nutrition and environmental reforms (such as getting clean water supplies).&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt;

The present day sense of health being a public concern for the state began in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Lindemann"&gt;{{cite book| last = Lindemann| first = Mary| title = Medicine and Society in Early Modern Europe| year = 1999| publisher = Cambridge University Press| location = Cambridge| isbn = 978-0-521-41254-4| pages = 155–159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few state interventions include maintaining clean towns, enforcing quarantines during [[epidemics]] and supervising sewer systems.&lt;ref name=Lindemann/&gt; Private corporations also played a role in public health. The funding for research and the institutions for them to work were funded by governments and private firms.&lt;ref name=Lindemann/&gt; Epidemics were the cause of most government interventions. The early goal of public health was [[reactionary]] whereas the modern goal is to prevent disease before it becomes a problem.&lt;ref name=Lindemann/&gt; Despite the overall improvement of world health, there still has not been any decrease in the health gap between the affluent and the impoverished.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite book| author3 = David Field| last1 = Taylor| first1 = Steve| last2 = Field| first2 = David| title = Sociology of Health and Health Care| url = https://books.google.com/?id=0OPjngEACAAJ| year = 2007| publisher = Wiley-Blackwell| location = Oxford, England| isbn = 978-1-4051-5172-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, society is more likely to blame health issues on the individual rather than society as a whole. This was the prevailing view in the late 20th century.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; In the 1980s the [[Black Report]], published in the United Kingdom, went against this view and argued that the true root of the problem was material deprivation.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; This report proposed a comprehensive anti-poverty strategy to address these issues.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; Since this did not parallel the views of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government, it did not go into action immediately.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; The Conservative government was criticized by the Labour Party for not implementing the suggestions that the Black Report listed.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; This criticism gave the Black Report the exposure it needed and its arguments were considered a valid explanation for health inequality.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; There is also a debate over whether [[poverty]] causes ill-health or if ill-health causes poverty.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; Arguments by the [[National Health Service]] gave considerable emphasis to poverty and lack of access to health care. It has also been found that [[heredity]] has more of a bearing on health than social environment, but research has also proved that there is indeed a positive correlation between socioeconomic inequalities and illness.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;

==Methodology==
The Sociology of Health and Illness looks at three areas: the conceptualization, the study of measurement and social distribution, and the justification of patterns in health and illness. By looking at these things researchers can look at different diseases through a sociological lens. The prevalence and response to different diseases varies by [[culture]].&lt;ref name= Marshall/&gt; By looking at bad health, researchers can see if health affects different social regulations or controls. When measuring the distribution of health and illness, it is useful to look at official [[statistics]] and community surveys. Official statistics make it possible to look at people who have been treated. It shows that they are both willing and able to use health services. It also sheds light on the infected person's view of their [[illness]]. On the other hand, community surveys look at people's rating of their health. Then looking at the relation of clinically defined illness and self reports and find that there is often a discrepancy.

A great deal of the time, mortality statistics take the place of the morbidity statistics because in many developed societies where people typically die from degenerative conditions, the age in which they die sheds more light on their life-time health. This produces many [[wikt:limitation|limitations]] when looking at the pattern of sickness, but sociologists try to look at various data to analyze the distribution better. Normally, developing societies have lower life expectancies in comparison to developed countries. They have also found correlations between mortality and sex and age. Very young and old people are more susceptible to sickness and [[death]]. On average women typically live longer than men, although women are more likely to have bad health.&lt;ref name="Marshall"&gt;Marshall, Gordon. "Health and illness, sociology of."

Disparities in health were also found between people in different social classes and ethnicities within the same society, even though in the medical profession they put more importance in “health related behaviors” such as alcohol consumption, smoking, diet, and exercise. There is a great deal of data supporting the conclusion that these behaviors affect health more significantly than other factors.&lt;ref name= Marshall/&gt; Sociologists think that it is more helpful to look at health and illness through a broad lens. Sociologists agree that [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] consumption, smoking, diet, and exercise are important issues, but they also see the importance of analyzing the cultural factors that affect these patterns. Sociologists also look at the effects that the productive process has on health and illness. While also looking at things such as industrial [[pollution]], environmental pollution, accidents at work, and stress-related diseases.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

Social factors play a significant role in developing health and illness. Studies of [[epidemiology]] show that autonomy and control in the workplace are vital factors in the etiology of heart disease. One cause is an effort-reward imbalance. Decreasing career advancement opportunities and major imbalances in control over work have been coupled with various negative health costs. Various studies have shown that pension rights may shed light on mortality differences between retired men and women of different socioeconomic statuses. These studies show that there are outside factors that influence health and illness.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

==International perspective==

===Africa===
[[File:Map-of-HIV-Prevalance-in-Africa.png|thumb|Estimation of the number of adults in Africa who are infected with HIV or AIDS. Note that levels of infection are much higher in sub-Saharan Africa.]]

HIV/AIDS is the leading epidemic that affects the social welfare of Africa.&lt;ref name="Fredrickson"&gt;Fredrickson J, &amp; Kanabus, A. Impact of HIV/AIDS on Africa. retrieved Nov. 2009 from http://www.avert.org/aids-impact-africa.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can cause AIDS which is an acronym for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), a condition in humans in which the [[immune system]] begins to fail, leading to life-threatening infections. Two-thirds of the worlds HIV population is located in Sub-Saharan Africa. Since the epidemic started more than 15 million Africans have died by complications with HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=Fredrickson/&gt;

People apart of religious sub-groups of Sub-Saharan [[Africa]] and those who actively and frequently participate in religious activities are more likely to be at a lower risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. On the opposite end, there are many beliefs that an infected male can be cured of the [[infection]] by having sex with a virgin. These beliefs increase the number of people with the [[virus]] and also increase the number of rapes against women.&lt;ref name="Babb, DA. 2007"&gt;Babb, DA. (2007) Use of traditional medicine by HIV infected individuals. Psycho Health Med. 12, 314-320.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbal treatment is one of the primary medicines used to treat HIV in Africa. It is used more than standard treatment because it is more affordable.&lt;ref name=Fredrickson/&gt; Herbal treatment is more affordable but is not researched and is poorly regulated . This lack of research on whether the herbal medicines work and what the medicines consist of is a major flaw in the healing cycle of HIV in Africa.&lt;ref name="Babb, DA. 2007"/&gt;

Economically, HIV has a significant negative effect. The labor force in Africa is slowly diminishing, due to HIV-related deaths and illness. In response, government income declines and so does tax revenue. The government has to spend more money than it is making, in order to care for those affected with HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=Fredrickson/&gt;
[[File:Aid Orphans in Malawi 2.jpeg|thumb|AIDS orphans in Malawi]]
A major social problem in Africa in regards to HIV is the orphan epidemic. The orphan epidemic in Africa is a regional problem. In most cases, both of the parents are affected with HIV. Due to this, the children are usually raised by their grandmothers and in extreme cases they are raised by themselves. In order to care for the sick parents, the children have to take on more responsibility by working to produce an income. Not only do the children lose their parents but they also lose their childhood as well. Having to provide care for their parents, the children also miss out on an education which increases the risk of teen pregnancy and people affected with HIV. The most efficient way to diminish the orphan epidemic is prevention: preventing children from acquiring HIV from their mothers at birth, as well as educating them on the disease as they grow older. Also, educating adults about HIV and caring for the infected people adequately will lower the orphan population.&lt;ref&gt;Epidemics: Malaria, AIDS, Other Disease: Post-colonial Africa. (2004). In Encyclopedia of African History. Retrieved Nov. 2009 from http://www.credoreference.com/entry/routafricanhistory/epidemics_malaria_aids_other_disease_postcolonial_africa&lt;/ref&gt;

The HIV/AIDS epidemic is reducing the average [[life expectancy]] of people in Africa by twenty years. The age range with the highest death rates, due to HIV, are those between the ages of 20 and 49 years. The fact that this age range is when adults acquire most of their [[income]] they cannot afford to send their children to school, due to the high medication costs. It also removes the people who could help aid in responding to the epidemic.&lt;ref name=Fredrickson/&gt;

===Asia===
Asian countries have wide variations of population, wealth, technology and health care, causing attitudes towards health and illness to differ. [[Japan]], for example, has the third highest life expectancy (82 years old), while [[Afghanistan]] has the 11th worst (44 years old).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html |title=Country Comparison:: Life Expectancy at Birth |work= CIA- the World Factbook |year=2009 |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |accessdate= Nov 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key issues in Asian health include childbirth and maternal health, HIV and AIDS, mental health, and aging and the elderly. These problems are influenced by the sociological factors of religion or belief systems, attempts to reconcile traditional medicinal practices with modern professionalism, and the economic status of the inhabitants of Asia.
[[File:People living with HIV AIDS world map.PNG|thumb|People living with [[HIV/AIDS]]]]

Like the rest of the world, Asia is threatened by a possible pandemic of HIV and AIDS. [[Vietnam]] is a good example of how society is shaping Asian HIV/AIDS awareness and attitudes towards this disease. Vietnam is a country with feudal, traditional roots, which, due to invasion, wars, technology and travel is becoming increasingly globalized. [[Globalization]] has altered traditional viewpoints and values. It is also responsible for the spread of HIV and AIDS in Vietnam. Even early globalization has added to this problem – Chinese influence made Vietnam a [[Confucianism|Confucian society]], in which women are of less importance than men. Men in their superiority have no need to be sexually responsible, and women, generally not well educated, are often unaware of the risk, perpetuating the spread of HIV and AIDS as well as other STIs.&lt;ref name="Micollier"&gt;{{cite book| last = Micollier| first = Evelyne| title = Sexual cultures in East Asia the social construction of sexuality and sexual risk in a time of AIDS| url = https://books.google.com/?id=LMk5ngEACAAJ| year = 2004| publisher = Routledge| location = London| isbn = 978-0-415-30871-7| pages = 98–101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucianism has had a strong influence on the belief system in Asia for centuries, particularly in China, Japan, and Korea, and its influence can be seen in the way people chose to seek, or not seek, medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/9703/Humanity-Asian-Thought-Spread-Confucianism.html |title=The Spread of Confucianism |author=Powers, John |accessdate= Dec 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An important issue in Asia is societal effect on the ability of disabled individuals to adjust to a disability. Cultural beliefs shape attitudes towards physical and mental disabilities. China exemplifies this problem. According to Chinese Confucian tradition (which is also applicable in other countries where [[Confucianism]] has been spread), people should always pursue good health in their lives, with an emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention.&lt;ref name=Yang/&gt; To the Chinese, having a disability signifies that one has not led a proper lifestyle and therefore there is a lack of opportunities for disabled individuals to explore better ways to accept or adapt to their disability.&lt;ref name=Yang/&gt;

Indigenous healing practices are extremely diverse throughout Asia but often follow certain patterns and are still prevalent today. Many traditional healing practices include [[shamanism]] and [[herbalism|herbal medicines]], and may have been passed down orally in small groups or even institutionalized and professionalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author3 = Geoffrey Samuel| last1 = Connor| first1 = Linda| last2 = Samuel| first2 = Geoffrey| title = Healing powers and modernity traditional medicine, shamanism, and science in Asian societies| url = https://books.google.com/?id=e0Zx44BOiDoC| year = 2001| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| location = Westport, Connecticut| isbn = 978-0-89789-715-0| pages = 3–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many developing countries the only health care available until a few decades ago were those based on traditional medicine and spiritual healing. Now governments must be careful to create health policies that strike a balance between modernity and tradition. Organizations, like the [[World Health Organization]], try to create policies that respect tradition without trying to replace it with modern science, instead regulating it to ensure safety but keeping it accessible.&lt;ref name="Packer"&gt;{{cite book| author4 = Choon Nam Ong | author5= Barry Halliwell|lastauthoramp=y| last1 = Packer| first1 = Lester| last2 = Ong| first2 = Choon Nam| last3 = Halliwell| first3 = Barry| title = Herbal and traditional medicine molecular aspects of health| url = https://books.google.com/?id=xzj6ngEACAAJ| year = 2004| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 978-0-8247-5436-5| pages = 2–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; India in particular tries to make traditional medicines safe but still available to as many people as possible, adapting tradition to match modernization while still considering the economic positions and culture of its citizens.&lt;ref name=Packer/&gt;
[[File:Flag of WHO.svg|thumb|Flag of World Health Organization]]

Mental health issues are gaining an increasing amount of attention in the Asian countries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Many of these countries have a preoccupation with modernizing and developing their economies, resulting in cultural changes. In order to reconcile modern techniques with traditional practices, [[social psychology|social psychologists]] in India are in the process of “[[indigenization|indigenizing]] psychology”. Indigenous psychology is that which is derived from the laws, theories, principals, and ideas of a culture and unique to each society.&lt;ref name="Yang"&gt;{{cite book| last = Yang| first = Guoshu| title = Progress in Asian social psychology conceptual and empirical contributions| url = https://books.google.com/?id=o4itQDGGvYgC| year = 2003| publisher = [[Greenwood Publishing Group]]| location = Westport, Connecticut| isbn = 978-0-313-32463-5| pages = 11–12, 294–295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many Asian countries, childbirth is still treated by traditional means and is thought of with regional attitudes. For example, in [[Pakistan]], decisions concerning pregnancy and [[obstetrics|antenatal care]] (ANC) are usually made by older women, often the pregnant woman's mother-in-law, while the mother and father to be are distanced from the process. They may or may not receive professional ANC depending on their education, class, and financial situation.&lt;ref&gt;Mumtaz and Salway. Gender, pregnancy and the uptake of antenatal care services in Pakistan. ''Sociology of Health and Illness,'' Vol. 29, No. 1 pp. 1-26: 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally in Asia, childbirth is still a woman's area and male obstetricians are rare. Female midwives and healers are still the norm in most places. Western methods are overtaking the traditional in an attempt to improve maternal health and increase the number of live births.&lt;ref name="Rozario"&gt;{{cite book| author3 = Geoffrey Samuel| last1 = Rozario| first1 = Santi| last2 = Samuel| first2 = Geoffrey| title = the Daughters of Hariti childbirth and female healers in South and Southeast Asia| url = https://books.google.com/?id=ge-JngEACAAJ| year = 2002| publisher = Routledge| location = London| isbn = 978-0-415-27792-1| pages = 1–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asian countries, which are mostly developing nations, are [[population ageing|aging rapidly]] even as they are attempting to build their economies. Even wealthy Asian nations, such as Japan, [[Singapore]], and [[Taiwan]], also have very elderly populations and thus have to try to sustain their economies and society with small younger generations while caring for their elderly citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Phillips| first = David| title = Ageing in the Asia-Pacific region issues, policies, and future trends| url = https://books.google.com/?id=fS4YngEACAAJ| year = 2000| publisher = Routledge| location = London| isbn = 978-0-415-22018-7| pages = xiv-xv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The elderly have been traditionally well respected and well cared for in most Asian cultures; experts predict that younger generations in the future are less likely to be concerned and involved in the health care of their older relatives due to various factors such as women joining the workforce more, the separation of families because of urbanization or migration, and the proliferation of [[Westernisation|Western ideals]] such as individualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Hermalin| first = Albert| title = the Well-being of the elderly in Asia a four-country comparative study| url = https://books.google.com/?id=OzXqngEACAAJ| year = 2002| publisher = [[University of Michigan Press]]| isbn = 978-0-472-11280-7| pages = 1–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
The health patterns found on the continent of [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] which includes the [[Pacific Islands]], have been very much influenced by [[European colonization]]. While indigenous medicinal beliefs are not significantly prevalent in Australia, traditional ideas are still influential in the health care problems in many of the islands of the Pacific.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book| author3 = Kerrie L. Macpherson| last1 = Lewis| first1 = Milton James| last2 = Macpherson| first2 = Kerrie L.| title = Public health in Asia and the Pacific historical and comparative perspectives| url = https://books.google.com/?id=pR14OqopGe8C| year = 2007| publisher = Routledge| location = London| isbn = 978-0-415-35962-7| pages = 222–235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid [[urbanization]] of Australia led to epidemics of [[typhoid fever]] and the [[Bubonic plague]]. Because of this, public health was professionalized beginning in the late 1870s in an effort to control these and other diseases. Since then Australia's health system has evolved similarly to Western countries and the main cultural influence affecting health care are the political ideologies of the parties in control of the government.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;
[[File:Bayer Heroin bottle.jpg|thumb|upright|Old heroin bottle]]
Australia has had treatment facilities for 'problem drinkers' since the 1870s. In the 1960s and 1970s it was recognized that Australia had several hundred thousand alcoholics and prevention became a priority over cures, as there was a societal consensus that treatments are generally ineffective.&lt;ref name= Lewis/&gt; The government began passing laws attempting to curb alcohol consumption but consistently met opposition from the [[Australian wine|wine-making regions of southern Australia]]. The government has also waged a war on illegal drugs, particularly [[heroin]], which in the 1950s became widely used as a pain reliever.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;

Experts believe that many of the health problems in the Pacific Islands can be traced back to European colonization and the subsequent globalization and modernization of island communities.&lt;ref name="Otsuka"&gt;{{cite book| author3 = Stanley J. Ulijaszek| last1 = Ohtsuka| first1 = Ryutaro| last2 = Ulijaszek| first2 = Stanley J.| title = Health change in the Asia-Pacific region biocultural and epidemiological approaches| url = https://books.google.com/?id=T5M1nwEACAAJ| year = 2007| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-83792-7| pages = 4, 7–9, 136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[History of the Pacific Islands]].) European colonization and late independence meant modernization but also slow economic growth, which had an enormous effect on health care, particularly on [[nutrition]] in the Pacific Islands. The end of colonization meant a loss of medical resources, and the fledgling independent governments could not afford to continue the health policies put in place by the colonial governments.&lt;ref name= Otsuka/&gt; Nutrition was changed radically, contributing to various other health problems. While more prosperous, urban areas could afford food, they chose poor diets, causing 'overnourishment', and leading to extremely high levels of [[obesity]], [[type 2 diabetes]], and cardiovascular diseases. Poorer rural communities, on the other hand, continue to suffer from [[malnutrition]] and [[malaria]].&lt;ref name= Otsuka/&gt;

Traditional diets in the Pacific are very low in fat, but since World War II there has been a significant increase in [[fat]] and [[protein]] in Pacific diets. Native attitudes towards weight contribute to the obesity problem. [[Tonga]]n natives see obesity as a positive thing, especially in men. They also believe that women should do as little physical work as possible while the men provide for them, meaning they get very little exercise.&lt;ref name= Otsuka/&gt;

===Europe===
The largest endeavors to improve health across Europe is the [[World Health Organization]] European Region.&lt;ref name="Nosikov"&gt;{{cite report|title= The European Health Report 2002|last= Nosikov|first= Anatoliy|year= 2002|publisher= World Health Organization Regional Office Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to improve the health of poor and disadvantaged populations by promoting healthy lifestyles including environmental, economic, social and providing [[health care]].&lt;ref name=Nosikov/&gt; Overall health in Europe is very high compared to the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=Nosikov/&gt; The average life expectancy is around 78 in [[European Union|EU]] countries but there is a wide gap between Western and Eastern Europe. It is as low as 67 in Russia and 73 in the [[Balkan]] states.&lt;ref name=Nosikov/&gt; Europe is seeing an increase in the spread of [[HIV/AIDS]] in Eastern Europe because of a worsening socioeconomic situation.&lt;ref name=Nosikov/&gt; [[Cardiovascular disease]], cancer and [[diabetes mellitus]] are more prevalent is Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=Nosikov/&gt; The [[WHO]] claims that poverty is the most important factor bringing on ill health across Europe.&lt;ref name=Nosikov/&gt; Those at low [[socioeconomic status]] levels and many young people are also at risk because of their increased tobacco, alcohol and drug abuse.&lt;ref name=Nosikov/&gt; Health and illness prevention in Europe is largely funded by the governmental services including: regulating health care, insurance and social programs.&lt;ref name=Nosikov/&gt; The role of religion and traditional medicine, however, is often left unexamined in such reports.

The study of [[hypertension]] within the [[United Kingdom]] has turned to examining the role that beliefs play in its diagnosis and treatment. Hypertension is an essential topic for study since it is linked to increased risk of [[stroke]] and [[coronary heart disease]]. The most common treatment for hypertension is medication but compliance for this treatment plan is low.&lt;ref name="Morgan"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Managing hypertension: beliefs and responses to medication among cultural groups|last= Morgan|first= Myfanwy|year= 1988|publisher= Sociology of Health &amp; Illness, Vol. 10, No. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted in the UK examined the differences between 'white' patients and first generation immigrants from the West Indies. There were differing reasons for non-compliance that involve the patients' perception and beliefs about the [[diagnosis]]. Patients commonly believe that high levels of [[anxiety]] when first diagnosed are the major cause and think that when stress levels decline so too will their hypertension. Other respondents in this UK based study had varying beliefs concerning the necessity of medication while others still argued that it was the [[side effects]] of medication that made them end their prescribed regimen.&lt;ref name=Morgan/&gt; West Indian respondents whose lay [[culture]] teaches them to reject long-term drug therapy opted instead for folk remedies in higher numbers than the 'white' respondents. What can be seen here is that some people will choose to ignore a doctor's expert advice and will employ 'lay consultation' instead.&lt;ref name=Morgan/&gt;
[[File:World Health Organisation regional offices.svg|thumb| Regions of the [[WHO]]]]

Before people seek medical help they try to interpret the symptoms themselves and often consult people in their lives or use 'self-help' measures.&lt;ref name="Punamaki"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Reasons for consultation and explanations of illness among Finnish primary-care patients|last= Punamaki|first= Raija-Leena|year= 1995|publisher= Sociology of Health &amp; Illness, Vol. 17, No. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of 'everyday illness' in [[Finland]] including: [[influenza]], [[infections]] and [[musculo-skeletal]] problems focused on reasons for consulting medical experts and explanations of illness. These common illness were examined not because of their seriousness but because of their frequency. The researchers explain five possible triggers that people seek medical aid: 1- the occurrence of an interpersonal crisis 2- perceived interference with social and personal relations 3- perceived interference with vocational &amp; [[physical activity]] 4- sanctioning by other people 5- sufferers ideas about how long certain complaints should last. These kind of explanatory models are part of the process that people use to construct medical culture.&lt;ref name=Punamaki/&gt; They give meaning to illness and health, answer questions about personal responsibility about health and most importantly are part of the dialogue between patients' and professionals' illness explanations. It can help explore why some patients will follow a doctors instructions to the letter and others ignore them completely. A patient's explanation or understanding of their illness can be much broader than a physician's and this dynamic has become a major criticism of modern medical practice since it normally excludes the "social, psychological and experiential dimensions of illness."&lt;ref name=Punamaki/&gt;

The Finnish study examined 127 patients and the results have been different from findings in other countries where there is more 'lay consultation'. Half of the respondents did not have any lay consultation before coming to the doctors office. One-third did not try any self-treatment and three-quarters of the sample consulted the doctor within three days of symptoms developing.&lt;ref name=Punamaki/&gt; Possible explanations are that in [[Finland]] there is an aspect "over-protectiveness" within their health care system. Many{{Who|date=May 2011}} might conclude that the Finnish people are dependent and helpless but the researchers of this study found that people chose to consult professionals because they trusted them over some lay explanation. These results echo similar studies in Ireland that explain this phenomenon as being based in a strong work ethic. Illness in these countries will affect their work and Finnish people will quickly get treatment so they can return to work. This research out of Finland also describes that this relationship between patient and doctor is based on:
# national and municipal administrative bureaucracies that demand more output and more satisfied patients
# the public demanding better care
# nurses criticizing physicians for not taking a holistic view of patients
# hospital specialists wanting better/earlier screening for serious illnesses (e.g. cancer).&lt;ref name=Punamaki/&gt;

The conflict between medical and lay worlds is prominent. On one hand many patients believe they are the expert of their own body and view the [[Doctor-patient relationship]] as [[authoritarian]]. These people will often use knowledge outside the medical field to deal with health and illness. Others see the doctor as the expert and are shy about describing their symptoms and therefore rely on the doctor for diagnosis and treatment.&lt;ref name=Punamaki/&gt;

===North America===
[[File:Obesity country comparison - path.svg|thumb|Compares figures in the population of [[OECD]] countries and the percentage of total population (aged 15 and above) with a [[body mass index]] greater than 30. Data was collected between 1996 and 2003.]]

North America is a fairly recent settled continent, made up of the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. It was built by an amalgamation of wealth, ideas, culture, and practices. North America is highly advanced intellectually, technologically, and traditionally. This advantageous character of North American nations has caused a high average [[life expectancy]] of 75 years for males and 80 years for females. This leads to the conclusion that North America has cultivated a comparatively healthy society. As North America contains several core nations, the growing economies in those nations are able to maintain and develop medical institutions. This subsequently provides more access to health care for American citizens but health care is not universal. North America is known for being a leading nation in regards to [[industrialization]] and modernization, but the United States lacks federal laws regarding health care as a basic human right. This lag of health care security causes subsequent issues with pharmaceutical competition, lack of care for the elderly, and little attention to alternative medicine.&lt;ref name=Conrad/&gt; Health care and education are plentiful at a price and illness still persists for many reasons.&lt;ref name="WHO World Health Statistics 2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/whosis/whostat/2008/en/index.html |title=WHO World Health Statistics 2008 |year=2008 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=Dec 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A main reason is that a lower- and middle-class population still exists in plentiful numbers, maintaining a group that is highly vulnerable to physical ailment.
[[File:Alcohol by country.svg|thumb|World map showing alcohol consumption around the world]]

North America's primary [[risk factors]] for illness are currently{{When|date=May 2011}} alcohol abuse, [[malnutrition]], [[obesity]], [[tobacco]] use, and water sanitation.&lt;ref name="WHO World Health Statistics 2008"/&gt; [[Obesity]] is a recent epidemic in North America. The 1990s brought a rise in the average [[Body Mass Index]], or BMI. From the beginning and to the end of the decade, the median percent of adults who were obese rose from 12% to 20%.&lt;ref name="WHO World Health Statistics 2008"/&gt; [[Alcoholism]] is the addiction of over-consumption of alcohol and is highly prevalent in the US. There are high incidence rates in many other world regions. Roughly 61% of American adults drank in 2007, and 21% of current drinkers consumed five or more drinks at one point in the last year. There have also been 22,073 alcohol induced deaths in the United States in the past year, about 13,000 of which were related to liver disease.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Disease Control and Prevention: FastStats. Alcohol Use. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/alcohol.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Alcoholism has many risk factors ingrained in North American culture, such as heredity, stress from competition or availability.

The [[Swine Flu]] (also known as (H1N1) epidemic is a recent disease emerging in the early 21st century. In April 2009, during the early days of the outbreak, a molecular biologist named Dr. Henry Miller wrote in the ''Wall Street Journal'' about [[New York City]] high-school students. These students apparently brought the virus back from [[Mexico]] and infected their classmates.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller, Henry I. Wall Street Journal: Understanding Swine Flu, April 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; All six cases so far reported in [[Canada]] were connected directly or indirectly with travel to Mexico as well. Flu viruses can be directly transmitted (via droplets from sneezing or coughing) from pigs to people, and vice versa. These cross-species infections occur most commonly when people are close to large numbers of pigs, such as in barns, livestock exhibits at fairs, and slaughterhouses. The flu is transmissible from human to human, either directly or via contaminated surfaces."&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

===South America===
There are many [[disease]]s that affect [[South America]], but two major conditions are [[malaria]] and [[Hepatitis]] D.
Malaria affects every country in South America except [[Uruguay]], [[Chile]], and The [[Falkland Islands]]. [[Elevation]] is a major factor in the areas where malaria is found. The disease is spread from person to person via [[mosquito]] bites. People are typically bitten by mosquitoes at dusk and dawn. [[Symptoms]] of this disorder are: high fever, chills, sweating, headaches, body aches, weakness, vomiting and [[diarrhea]]. If left untreated, new symptoms can occur; people that are infected may experience [[seizures]], delirium and [[coma]]. Severe cases may end in [[death]]. Malaria can be cured, but the symptoms may not become noticeable until months later. There are three forms of medication that can cure Malaria. An infected person's accessibility to these drugs is dependent upon their access to medical care and their financial situation. Literature about Malaria treatment typically is focused toward people who are tourists. Most sources are not written with the native in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Palmerlee| first1 = Danny| last2 = Bao| first2 = Sandra| last3 = Beech| first3 = Charlotte| title = South America on a shoestring| year = 2004| isbn = 978-1-74104-163-7| page = 1056 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Malaria map.PNG|thumb|Malaria]]

The first sign of [[Hepatitis]] D was detected in 1978 when a strange and unrecognizable internuclear [[antigen]] was discovered during a [[liver]] [[biopsy]] of several Italians who suffered HBV infection. Scientists initially thought that it was an antigenic specificity of HBV, but they soon found that it was a [[protein]] from another disease altogether. They called it "Hepatitis Delta Virus" (HDV). This new virus was found to be defective. HDV needed HBV to act as a helper function in order for it to be detected. Normally Hepatitis B is transmitted through [[blood]] or any type of blood product. In [[South America]] Hepatitis D was found to be fatal. [[Scientist]]s are still unsure in what way this disease was being transmitted throughout certain South American countries. Sexual contact and [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] are the most common means of transmission. HDV is still considered an unusual form of hepatitis. Agents of this virus resemble that of plant viroids. It is still hard to tell how many stereotypes exist because HDV is under the umbrella of HBV. HDV causes very high titers in the blood of people who are infected. Incubation of Hepatitis D typically lasts for thirty five days. Most often Hepatitis D is a co-infection with Hepatitis B or a super-infection with chronic hepatitis. In terms of super infections there are high mortality rates, ranging seventy to eighty percent; in contrast with co-infections which have a one to three percent mortality rate. There is little information with the ecology of Hepatitis D. Epidemics have been found in Venezuela, Peru, Columbia, and Brazil. People who are treated for Hepatitis B have been able to control Hepatitis D. People who have chronic HDB will continue to get HDV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = for the National Academy of Sciences| title = Infectious Diseases in an Age of Change The Impact of Human Ecology and Behavior on Disease Transmission| year = 1995| publisher = National Academies Press| isbn = 0-309-05136-3| pages = 67–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another disease that affects South America is HIV and AIDS. In 2008 roughly two million people had HIV and AIDS. By the end of 2008 one hundred and seventy thousand people were infected with AIDS and HIV. Seventy seven thousand people died from this disease by the end of that year. Brazil has the most people that are affected with AIDS and HIV in South America. Forty-three percent of people in Brazil have HIV.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In Brazil sixty percent of the inhabitants use drugs, are HIV positive, and are HIV positive because of their drug use. Usually this disease is transmitted by either drug use involving needles or unprotected sex. Sharing needles and being infected with HIV and AIDS is most common in Paraguay and Uruguay. South America is trying to get treatment to the thousands of people infected by this disease. Brazil is offering generic AIDS prescriptions that are much less expensive than the name brand drugs. One hundred and eighty-one thousand inhabitants in Brazil who were infected are being treated. That accounts for eighty percent of those who needed immediate help. This aid from the government has had positive results. Statistics show that there was a fifty percent decrease in mortality rates, approximately sixty to eighty percent decrease in morbidity rates and a seventy percent decrease in hospitalization of infected people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Willcox| first1 = Merlin| last2 = Bodeker| first2 = Gerard| last3 = Rasoanaivo| first3 = Philippe| title = Traditional Medicinal Plants and Malaria| year = 2004| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 978-0-415-30112-1| page = 173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In very remote areas of South America, traditional healers are the only forms of health care people have.&lt;ref&gt;Willcox, Merlin, Gerard Bodeker and Philippe Rasoanaivo. Traditional medicinal plants and malaria. United States of America: CRC Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
In north Aymara and south Mapuche, where the indigenous groups have the strongest voices, they still heavily use traditional medicine. The government in Chile has implemented an Indigenous Health System to help strengthen the health care system. Even with Chile's indigenous groups, Chile still has the best public health services in South America.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} They also have the lowest mortality rates in the area. Their health care policies are centered around family and community wellbeing by focusing on the strategies for prevention health strategies. Reports have shown an increase in mental health issues, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.&lt;ref&gt;World Learning Study Abroad. 2009. 3 December 2009 &lt;http://www.sit.edu/studyabroad/ssa_cih.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

South America's economy is developing rapidly and has a great deal of industries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The major industry in South America are agriculture. Other industries are fishing, handicrafts, and natural resources. Its trade and import-export market is continually thriving. In the past South American countries moved slowly in regards to economic development. South America began to build its economy ever since World War II. South America's largest economies are Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Columbia. Venezuela, Peru, and Argentina's economy are growing very rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Encyclopedia of World Geography China-Taiwan| year = 2002| isbn = 978-0-7614-7289-6| page = 672 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Southern Illinois University Carbondale''' ('''SIUC''') is a public research university in [[Carbondale, Illinois]], United States. Founded in 1869, SIUC has historically been the largest of the campuses of the [[Southern Illinois University]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icpn.museum.state.il.us/institution/morris-library-southern-illinois-university-carbondale|title=Morris Library at Southern Illinois University-Carbondale|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university enrolls students from all 50 states as well as more than 100 countries. SIU Carbondale offers 3 associate's, 100 bachelor's, 73 master's, and 36 Ph.D programs in addition to professional degrees in architecture, law and medicine.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irs.siu.edu/_common/documents/factbook17.pdf|title=Factbook 2016-2017|last=|first=|date=|website=irs.siu.edu|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://catalog.siu.edu/programs/index.php|title=Undergraduate Programs {{!}} 2017-2018 Academic Catalog {{!}} SIU|website=2017-2018 Academic Catalog|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gradschool.siu.edu/academics/|title=Degree Programs {{!}} Graduate School {{!}} SIU|website=Graduate School|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pulliam Hall (SIU).JPG|thumb|SIU Pulliam Hall during sunset]]

An Act of the Twenty-sixth General Assembly of Illinois, approved March 9, 1869, created '''Southern Illinois Normal College,''' the second state-supported [[normal school]] in Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Howard, ''Illinois: A History of the Prairie State'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1972), 341.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carbondale held the ceremony of cornerstone laying, May 17, 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, Eli G. (1955). ''Seventy-Five Years in Retrospect'', Carbondale, IL.: Southern Illinois University. pp. 11-13&lt;/ref&gt; The first historic session of Southern Illinois Normal University was a summer institute, with a first faculty of eight members and an enrollment of 53 students.&lt;ref&gt;"Southern Illinois University: the First Seventy-Five Years." ( Jan 1949). [http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=ua_docs]&lt;/ref&gt;

The university continued primarily as a teacher's college until [[Delyte W. Morris]] took office as president of the university in 1948. Morris was SIU's longest-serving president (1948–1970).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19991010060656/http://www.dailyegyptian.com/fall98/delytemorris/]&lt;/ref&gt; During his presidency, Morris transformed SIU, adding Colleges of Law, Medicine and Dentistry. Since World War II, higher education has been emphasized as a goal for more students. Southern Illinois University grew rapidly in size from 3,500 to over 24,800 students between 1950 and 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egyptianaaa.org/SI-History3.htm/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328072315/http://www.egyptianaaa.org/SI-History3.htm/|date=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, a second campus of SIU was established at Edwardsville.  This school, now known as [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]], is an independent university within the SIU system.

== Leadership ==
[[Randy Dunn]] was the eighth president of the Southern Illinois University System. Dr. Dunn served as president at two other state institutions and was the state superintendent of education, appointed to that role by the Illinois State Board of Education. His career in education includes classroom teaching, serving as principal at two school districts, serving as superintendent for two Illinois school systems, and holding the rank of professor at two universities including SIUC. Dr. Dunn has served on a number of committees, councils and task forces, and he contributes to a variety of scholarly publications. 
Dunn received his doctorate in educational administration from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1991.  He graduated from Illinois State University with a master's in administration and foundations in 1983, and the B.S. in education in 1980.
Before coming to Southern Illinois, he served as president at two other state institutions — Murray State University in Kentucky (2006-2013) and Youngstown State University in Ohio (2013-2014).  Before that, Dunn was the state superintendent of education, appointed to that role by the Illinois State Board of Education.  He is not a stranger to the SIU System, having held the rank of professor in the Department of Educational Administration and Higher Education at SIUC.  Dunn started at the Carbondale campus as an associate professor in 1995 and was named department chair in 2000, before leaving to assume the state superintendency.  During his term as chair, he also taught in the joint doctoral program in educational leadership at SIU Edwardsville.  Dunn began his academic career as an assistant professor in the Department of Leadership at The University of Memphis for two years before taking his faculty post at Southern Illinois University.

In July 2018 Randy Dunn stepped down as SIU system president, and was replaced by J. Kevin Dorsey, as interim president. Dorsey was the former dean of the SIU school of medicine.

Carlo Montemagno, a professor of engineering, became chancellor of SIU Carbondale on August 15, 2017. His appointment was approved by the university's Board of Trustees July 13, 2017, at the recommendation of SIU System President Randy Dunn.Dr. Montemagno is an internationally recognized expert in nanotechnology and biomedical engineering, focusing his work on linking multiple disciplines to solve problems in areas of health, energy and the environment. Prior to his appointment at SIU, he founded the interdisciplinary Ingenuity Lab based at the University of Alberta in Canada. In addition to leading the lab, which connects organizations and researchers from across the Province of Alberta, he served as director of the biomaterials program for the Canadian Research Council's National Institute for Nanotechnology as well as research chair in intelligent nanosystems for the Canadian National Research Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chancellor.siu.edu/|title=Chancellor {{!}} Southern Illinois University|website=Chancellor|language=en|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Southern Illinois Salukis}}
The '''Southern Illinois Salukis''' are the athletic teams representing Southern Illinois University Carbondale. The university first sponsored athletic teams during the 1913–14 school year, when they were known as the "Maroons." Students and faculty began lobbying for a new mascot during the late 1940s. On March 19, 1951, the student body voted to change the official nickname to the Salukis. The [[saluki]], the royal dog of ancient Egypt, was chosen as the mascot due to its reputation as a fast and tenacious hunter and because the southern Illinois region is known as "[[Little Egypt (region)|Little Egypt]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siusalukis.cstv.com/ot/saluki-mascot.html |title=Southern Illinois Official Athletic Site – Athletics |publisher=Siusalukis.cstv.com |date=March 19, 1951 |accessdate=January 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708212123/http://siusalukis.cstv.com/ot/saluki-mascot.html |archivedate=July 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Salukis sponsor 16 varsity teams. Most compete in the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] (MVC), specifically in men's and women's basketball, men's and women's cross country, men's and women's golf, softball, women's swimming, men's and women's tennis, men's and women's track and field, and volleyball. The football program competes in the [[Missouri Valley Football Conference]] (MVFC). Men's swimming is part of the [[Mid-American Conference]] (MAC).

=== Athletic highlights ===

=== Cardboard Boat Regatta ===
[[File:Siucampus lake.JPG|thumb|Sunset over Southern Illinois University's Campus Lake.]]
The Cardboard Boat Regatta is an event held every spring semester at Campus Lake. Participants include university students and community members both young and old. The goal is to complete three trips around a 200-yard course on the lake using makeshift cardboard boats. There are three different categories for entries: canoes or kayaks, experimental boats and instant boats (boats created on-site the day of the event).

The idea for a Cardboard Regatta first originated in 1974 at Southern Illinois University. Richard Archer, a professor of Art and Design, dreamed up a final examination for students in his freshman design class. [[Buckminster Fuller]], then a Distinguished Professor at SIU, had espoused the principle of "doing the most with the least," and faculty members found it intriguing to apply these principles in their classes. Archer felt it would be a real test of students' creativity and three-dimensional design skills to build human-sized boats made only of cardboard, and more than 40 years later, it is still happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gcbr.com/faqs.html|title=The Great Cardboard Boat Regatta FAQs|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160211185621/http://www.gcbr.com/faqs.html|archivedate=2016-02-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many communities, organizations and other universities around the country have joined in on the fun and now organize their own Cardboard Boat Regattas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8007">'''Total body irradiation''' (TBI) is a form of [[radiotherapy]] used primarily as part of the preparative regimen for [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|haematopoietic stem cell (or bone marrow) transplantation]]. As the name implies, TBI involves irradiation of the entire body, though in modern practice the [[lung]]s are often partially shielded to lower the risk of radiation-induced lung injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gore EM, Lawton CA, Ash RC, Lipchik RJ |title=Pulmonary function changes in long-term survivors of bone marrow transplantation |journal=Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=67–75 |date=August 1996 |pmid=8823260 |doi= 10.1016/S0360-3016(96)00123-X|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S036030169600123X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Soule BP |title=Pulmonary function following total body irradiation (with or without lung shielding) and allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant |journal=Bone Marrow Transplant. |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=573–8 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17637691 |doi=10.1038/sj.bmt.1705771 |url= |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Simone NL |author3=Savani BN |display-authors=3 |last4=Ning |first4=H |last5=Albert |first5=P S |last6=Barrett |first6=A J |last7=Singh |first7=A K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total body irradiation in the setting of bone marrow transplantation serves to destroy or suppress the recipient's immune system, preventing [[transplant rejection|immunologic rejection]] of transplanted donor [[bone marrow]] or [[hematopoietic stem cell|blood stem cells]]. Additionally, high doses of total body irradiation can eradicate residual [[cancer]] cells in the transplant recipient, increasing the likelihood that the transplant will be successful.

==Dosage==
Doses of total body irradiation used in bone marrow transplantation typically range from 10 to &gt;12&amp;nbsp;[[gray (unit)|Gy]]. For reference, a dose of 4.5&amp;nbsp;Gy is [[Median lethal dose|fatal in 50% of exposed individuals]] without aggressive medical care.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090730004606/http://www1.va.gov/emshg/docs/Radiological_Medical_Countermeasures_Indexed-Final.pdf Department of Homeland Security Working Group on Radiological Dispersal Device (RDD) Preparedness], from the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]. Accessed May 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The 10-12 Gy is typically [[Dose fractionation|delivered across multiple fractions to minimise toxicities]] to the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=2247650 | volume=18 Suppl 1 | title=Clinical basis for TBI fractionation | year=1990 | author=Cosset JM, Girinsky T, Malaise E, Chaillet MP, Dutreix J | journal=Radiother Oncol | pages=60–7 | doi=10.1016/0167-8140(90)90179-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern practice, total body irradiation is typically [[Dose fractionation|fractionated]], with smaller doses delivered in several sessions, rather than delivering the entire dose at once. Early research in bone marrow transplantation by [[E. Donnall Thomas]] and colleagues demonstrated that this process of splitting TBI into multiple smaller doses resulted in lower toxicity and better outcomes than delivering a single, large dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thomas ED |title=Marrow transplantation for acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia in first remission |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=301 |issue=11 |pages=597–9 |date=September 1979 |pmid=381925 |doi= 10.1056/NEJM197909133011109|url= |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Buckner CD |author3=Clift RA |display-authors=3 |last4=Fefer |first4=Alexander |last5=Johnson |first5=F. Leonard |last6=Neiman |first6=Paul E. |last7=Sale |first7=George E. |last8=Sanders |first8=Jean E. |last9=Singer |first9=Jack W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thomas ED |title=Marrow transplantation for acute nonlymphoblastic leukemic in first remission using fractionated or single-dose irradiation |journal=Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=817–21 |date=May 1982 |pmid=7050046 |doi= |url= |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Clift RA |author3=Hersman J |display-authors=3 |last4=Sanders |first4=JE |last5=Stewart |first5=P |last6=Buckner |first6=CD |last7=Fefer |first7=A |last8=McGuffin |first8=R |last9=Smith |first9=JW}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time interval between fractions allows other normal tissues some time to repair some of the damage caused. However, the dosing is still high enough that the ultimate result is the destruction of both the patient's bone marrow (allowing donor marrow to engraft) and any residual cancer cells. [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation#Non-myeloablative|Non-myeloablative bone marrow transplantation]] uses lower doses of total body irradiation, typically about 2&amp;nbsp;Gy, which do not destroy the host bone marrow but do suppress the host immune system sufficiently to promote donor engraftment.

==Usage in other cancers==
In addition to its use in bone marrow transplantation, total body irradiation has been explored as a [[treatment modality]] for high-risk [[Ewing sarcoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kinsella TJ |title=Intensive combined modality therapy including low-dose TBI in high-risk Ewing's Sarcoma Patients |journal=Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. |volume=9 |issue=12 |pages=1955–60 |date=December 1983 |pmid=9463099 |doi= 10.1016/0360-3016(83)90368-1|url= |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Glaubiger D |author3=Diesseroth A |display-authors=3 |last4=Makuch |first4=R |last5=Waller |first5=B |last6=Pizzo |first6=P |last7=Glatstein |first7=E}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, subsequent findings suggest that TBI in this setting causes toxicity without improving disease control,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burdach S |title=High-dose therapy for patients with primary multifocal and early relapsed Ewing's tumors: results of two consecutive regimens assessing the role of total-body irradiation |journal=J. Clin. Oncol. |volume=21 |issue=16 |pages=3072–8 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12915596 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2003.12.039 |url= |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Meyer-Bahlburg A |author3=Laws HJ |display-authors=3 |last4=Haase |first4=R |last5=Van Kaik |first5=B |last6=Metzner |first6=B |last7=Wawer |first7=A |last8=Finke |first8=R |last9=Göbel |first9=U}}&lt;/ref&gt; and TBI is not currently used in the treatment of Ewing sarcoma outside of [[clinical trial]]s.

==Fertility==
Total body irradiation results in infertility in most cases, with recovery of gonadal function occurring in 10−14% of females. The number of pregnancies observed after [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]] involving such as procedure is lower than 2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tichelli André, Rovó Alicia | year = 2013 | title = Fertility Issues Following Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/810686_2?nlid=34365_904 | journal = Expert Rev Hematol | volume = 6 | issue = 4| pages = 375–388 | doi=10.1586/17474086.2013.816507}} &lt;br&gt;In turn citing: {{cite journal | author = Salooja N, Szydlo RM, Socie G ''et al.'' | year = 2001 | title = Pregnancy outcomes after peripheral blood or bone marrow transplantation: a retrospective survey | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 358 | issue = 9278| pages = 271–276 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(01)05482-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fertility preservation]] measures mainly include [[cryopreservation of ovarian tissue]], [[Embryo cryopreservation|embryos]] or [[Oocyte cryopreservation|oocyte]]s. Gonadal function has been reported to recover in less than 20% of males after TBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sanders JE, Hawley J, Levy W ''et al.'' | year = 1996 | title = Pregnancies following high-dose cyclophosphamide with or without high-dose busulfan or total-body irradiation and bone marrow transplantation | url = http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/87/7/3045.long | journal = Blood | volume = 87 | issue = | pages = 3045–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56774">In the early 1960s, an interest in women and their connection with the environment was sparked, largely by a book written by [[Esther Boserup]] entitled ''Woman's Role in Economic Development''.&lt;ref name=Tiondi&gt;{{cite thesis|author=Tiondi, T.|year=2001|title= Women, environment and development: Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America|type=Theses and Dissertations|id=Paper 1549|url=http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/1549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 1980s, policy makers and governments became more mindful of the connection between the environment and gender issues.&lt;ref name=GDRC&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Development Research Center|url=http://www.gdrc.org/|accessdate=2012-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes began to be made regarding natural resource and environmental management with the specific role of women in mind.  According to the World Bank in 1991, "Women play an essential role in the management of natural resources, including soil, water, forests and energy...and often have a profound traditional and contemporary knowledge of the natural world around them".&lt;ref name=WorldBanK&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdrc.org/gender/gender-envi.html|title=Gender and the Environment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas women were previously neglected or ignored, there was increasing attention paid to the impact of women on the natural environment and, in return, the effects the environment has on the health and well-being of women. The gender-environment relations have valuable ramifications in regard to the understanding of nature between men and women, the management and distribution of resources and responsibilities and the day-to-day life and well being of people.&lt;ref name=Env&amp;Planning&gt;Environment and Planning D: Society and Space 2011, volume 29, pages 237-253&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's connection with the environment==

===Women, environment and development (WED) debate===

Different discourses have shaped the way that sustainable development is approached, and as time goes on women have become more integrated in shaping these ideas. The definition of sustainable development is highly debated itself, but is defined by Harcourt as a way to "establish equity between generations" and to take into account "social, economic, and environmental needs to conserve non-renewable resources" and decrease the amount of waste produced by industrialization.&lt;ref name=harcourt&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harcourt|first1=Wendy|title=Feminist Perspectives on Sustainable Development.|date=1994|publisher=International Society for Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first discourse that emerged in relation to women was Women in Development (WID), the perspective that advocated for women's status to be improved in developing countries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, Development and Globalization: Economics as if all people mattered|last=Beneria|first=Lourdes|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-0415537490|location=New York|pages=1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; which then transformed into Women, Environment, and Development (WED). Critiques for WID included its place in a larger western mindset, perpetuating a colonial and liberal discourse that was not compatible with supporting the global population of women. WID placed women as central actors in household, rural and market economies and looked to the hierarchical institution of western development to fix the issues that arise because of this.&lt;ref name=harcourt /&gt;

The next shift in discourse took place in the early 1970s, where people began to critique the roots of development and start to look at alternative ways to go about interacting with the global community and developing countries, with women and the environment as central actors. This was defined as Women, Environment, Development (WED).&lt;ref name=braid&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braidotti|first1=Rosi|title=Women, the Environment, and Sustainable Development|date=1994|publisher=Zed Books in association with INSTRAW}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schultz et al., "The women, environment and development debate (WED-debate) is anchored in a critical view of development policies where the link between modernization/industrialization and technology on the one hand and environmental deterioration on the other is focused".&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schultz et al.|first1=Irmgard|title=Research on Gender, the Environment and Sustainable Development|journal=Institut für sozial-ökologische|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; WED discourse is centralized around the synthesis of different ideologies, one of which being ecofeminism.&lt;ref name=leach&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leach|first1=Melissa|title=. Earth Mother Myths and Other Ecofeminist Fables: How a Strategic Notion Rose and Fell.|journal=Development and Change|date=January 31, 2007|volume=38|issue=1|page=67-85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecofeminism may be seen as a root ideology for WED, whereas women are viewed with a biological connection to nature that enables them to have a deeper connection and stewardship of it. This ideology was transformed into the political sphere where it took a new shape as women having a socially constructed connection to nature through our global systems.&lt;ref name=leach /&gt;

Programs started in the 1990s based on the WED discourse and were instituted by the United Nations International Research Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW). These programs were in response to the relation between gender and environmental violences such as waste disposal, pesticide use nuclear testing and other detrimental environmental practices.&lt;ref name=braid /&gt;

The outcome of many of these programs did not produce the desired impacts on women.&lt;ref name=leach /&gt; The WED discourse placed emphasis on women as solution holders to environmental issues but policies were not directed at empowering women, rather the sectors that women are involved in, such as agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Missing Women in Agriculture Reforms|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=February 23, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leach argues that the overall impact of politicizing the role of women and the environment through the WED discourse appropriated women's labor without providing proper resources or capacity to succeed.&lt;ref name=leach /&gt;

=== Farming and agriculture ===
{{See also|Feminization of agriculture}}

In a majority of the world, women are responsible for farm work and related domestic food production.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agarwal, B.|date=Spring 1992|title=The gender and environment debate: lessons from India|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=18|issue=1|jstor=3178217|doi=10.2307/3178217|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243764296_The_Gender_and_Environment_Debate_Lessons_from_India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agarwal, B.|year=1998|title=Disinherited peasants, disadvantaged workers: a gender perspective on land and livelihood|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=33|number=13 (Mar. 26 – Apr. 3, 1998)|pp=A2–A1|jstor=4406578}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jiggins&gt;{{cite book|author=Jiggins, J. |year=2004|title=Changing the boundaries: Women-centered perspectives on population &amp; the environment|location= Covelo, Ca|publisher=Island Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lastarria-Cornhiel&gt;{{cite book|author=Lastarria-Cornhiel, S.|year=2006|title=Feminization of Agriculture: Trends and Driving Forces|location=Santiago|publisher= RIMISP}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increasing number of women are taking over and expanding their involvement in [[agricultural]] tasks but this has not changed the gender division of labor with regard to reproductive work.&lt;ref name=Lastarria-Cornhiel /&gt;  Esther Boserup looked into the farming systems of men and women in [[Africa]] and found that "in many African tribes, nearly all the tasks connected with food production continue to be left to women".&lt;ref name=Boserup&gt;Boserup, E. (1970). Woman's Role in Economic Development.  Male and female farming systems  (15-65).&lt;/ref&gt; Schultz ''et al.'' (2001), found that "90% of women in the developing world, where most of the planet's biological wealth is found, depend on their land for survival. Women head 30% of the households in developing countries, 80% of food production in sub-Saharan Africa is done by women, 60% in [[Asia]] and 50% in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt; Even though women are largely responsible for the actual agricultural work performed, men, generally own the land, therefore controlling women's labor upon the land.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; 

====Africa====
Esther Boserup examined the farming systems of men and women in Africa and found that "in many African tribes, nearly all the tasks connected with food production continue to be left to women".&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt; In Botswana, men typically have greater access to advanced technologies and plowing abilities.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; Zambia also has a high percentage of women farmers yet they are not explicitly recognize and often neglected entirely.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;  Consistent lack of access to credit, mobility, technological advancements, and land ownership further complicate women's agricultural roles. A group of women in Kenya began farming trees way before climate change was prioritized because they had seen what happens to lands that are depleted of its nutrients and the adverse effects&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steady|first=Filomina Chioma|date=2014|title=Women, Climate Change, and Liberation in Africa|url=http://libproxy.sdsu.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1690372156?accountid=13758|journal=Race, Gender &amp; Class|volume=21|pages=312-333|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Latin American and Caribbean====
In Peru, women often participate in food production and family farming yet they do not generally benefit directly from their labor.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; Their work is not considered as valuable as men's.  Women in the Caribbean have always been associated with agriculture and do have access to land ownership.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; However, women still do not have the same access to technology as men and generally have smaller plots of land.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; 

The dependence on nature and the environment for survival is common among Third World women.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; It has been argued by environmental feminists&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt; that this dependence creates a deeply rooted connection between women and their surroundings.  The dependency women have on natural resources, based on their responsibilities, creates a specific interest that may be different from the interests of men.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;  Jiggins et al. suggests that the views women have on nature are unique in that they connect the land to immediate survival and concern for future generations rather than simply looking at the land as a resource with monetary value.&lt;ref name=Jiggins /&gt; With the development of newer technologies since the 1940s, there has been a shift to more non-farm activities, however, men more than women are the ones participating in the shift, leaving women behind.&lt;ref name=Boserup /&gt; It has been projected that the continuation of men shifting to urban livelihoods, more and more women will be depended on to maintain the household by farming.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;Especially during the neoliberal policy regime in Latin America, with the increasing use of exports, women were ideal for their ‘gendered skills,’ they were paid less for their farming labor and not likely to organize, coining the term ‘feminization of responsibility.’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, Development and Globalization: Economics as if All People Mattered|last='Beneria'; 'Berik'; 'Floro'|first='Lourdes'; 'Gunseli'; 'Maria'|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|year=2016|isbn=|location=New York|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues such as climate change could have a greater impact on women because the land they farm will be negatively affected.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;

====Asia and Pacific Islands====
In the Asian and Pacific Island regions, 58% of women involved in the economy are found in the agriculture sector. This involves work in own-account farms, labor in small enterprises for processing fruits, vegetables and fish, paid and unpaid work on other peoples land, and collecting forest products.&lt;ref name=ESCAP&gt;{{cite book|last1=United Nations, Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific|title=Gender, the Environment and Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific|date=2017|publisher=United Nations ESCAP}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Out of all the women working in this sector, 10–20% have been found to have tenure to the land they work on.  Reasons for this number include economic and legal barriers. For example, in terms of loans women are found to get fewer and less loans to acquire land then men.&lt;ref name=ESCAP /&gt;

One other factor that plays into women’s land rights for agriculture is the cultural norms of the area.  In the Asian and the Pacific women’s societal rolls have been defined by patriarchal norms of the larger global society, where men are viewed as breadwinners and women are viewed as caretakers. This can be expressed through the number of hours women spend doing unpaid care work per day. In developing countries in total, women spend 4 hours and 30 minutes of care work a day versus the 1 hour and 2 minutes that men spend.&lt;ref name=ESCAP /&gt;

===Land ownership and property management===

In many parts of the world, specifically developing countries, there is a great deal of inequality when it comes to land ownership.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt; Traditional practices and bureaucratic factors often prevent women's access to natural resource development and management.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; Frequently, women do not have the right to own land and/or property, but they often are the ones who tend to the land. [[Bina Agarwal]], has written a great deal about gender and land rights in Third World countries and according to her, "Hence, insofar as there is a gender and class-based division of labor and distribution of property and power, gender and class structure people's interactions with nature and so structure the effects of environmental change on people and their responses to it."&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; Women's access to control of natural resources, land ownership and property management is a developing issue and is the subject of continuous debate in both the environmental realm and women's rights movement.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;

===Women's property status and the likelihood of violence===
"World wide, physical violence by husbands against wives is estimated to range between 10% and 50% (p824)".&lt;ref name=P&amp;A&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Panda, P.|author2=Agarwal, B.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2005|title= Marital violence, human development and women's property status in India|journal=World Development|volume=33|issue=5|pp=823–850|doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2005.01.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is difficult to pinpoint the causes of marital violence but economic dependence is widely acknowledged as one of the main sources. Land or property ownership provides women who may be experiencing marital violence with a credible exit option.  Land ownership creates a means of production of both income and power.&lt;ref name=Chowdhry&gt;{{cite web|author=Chowdhry, P.|year=2011|title= Reduction of Violence Against Women: Property Ownership &amp; Economic Independence in Rural Haryana|publisher=UN Women|url=http://www.unwomensouthasia.org/assets/Violence-Property-Rights2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study performed in Kerala, India examined the effects of property status and the likelihood of violence against women.  Close to 500 women were surveyed about a number of happenings in the household such as the amount of longterm and current violence that occurred, women's ownership of the land or house, and other sociodemographic characteristics.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt; The violence that occurs can be physical, such as hitting or kicking or psychological, such as threats or belittlement. Long-term violence, or violence that had been occurring throughout the entirety of the marriage, was experienced by 41% of women in rural households, while 27% of urban household women reported violence in various forms. Current violence, or violence occurring within 12 months of the time of survey was experienced by 29% in a physical capacity and 49% experienced psychological violence.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt;

Of all the women surveyed, 35% did not own any property and of that 35%, 49% experienced physical violence while 84% experienced psychological violence.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt; The amount of violence was significantly lower in households where women owned land or property.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt; According to this particular study, women's access to land and property ownership reduces the risk of spousal abuse by enhancing the livelihood of women as well as providing an escape route and means for survival if abuse begins.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt; In many developing countries, where marital violence is prominent, barriers such as unequal laws and social and administrative bias&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt; keep women from owning land and property.  A vast number of women are left out of owning immovable property (land or house) furthering their likelihood of experiencing marital violence.&lt;ref name=Chowdhry /&gt; (Chowdhry). It can also be argued that land rights greatly shape an individuals relationship with nature and the environment.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;

===Relationship between violence of nature and women===

The WED debate has examined the correlation between the degradation of the environment and the subordination of women.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; [[Carolyn Merchant]] and [[Vandana Shiva]] wrote that there is a connection between dominance of women and dominance of nature. Shiva said, "The rupture within nature and between man and nature, and its associated transformation from a life-force that sustains to an exploitable resource characterizes the Cartesian view which has displaced more ecological world-views and created a development paradigm which cripples nature and woman simultaneously".&lt;ref name=Shiva&gt;Shiva, V. (1988). Staying Alive, London: Zed.&lt;/ref&gt; Exploitation of women's labor as well as the abuse of natural environment are connected as they are both marginalized within the economy. Both the environment and women have been viewed as exploitable resources that are significantly undervalued.&lt;ref name=Perkins /&gt; This argument supports ecofeminism in that women in developing countries rely on nature to survive, therefore, destruction of the environment results in elimination of women's method to survival.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; According to Jiggins, environmental degradation effects women the most, furthering the inequalities between men and women.&lt;ref name=Jiggins /&gt; One study showed that new developments in technology and developments in land access are denied to women, furthering their subordination and inequality.&lt;ref name=Nightingale&gt;}{{cite journal|author1=Nightingale, A.|year=2006|title=The nature of gender: work, gender, and environment|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|volume=24|issue=2|pp= 165–185|url=http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/rgroves/nightingalepub1.pdf|doi=10.1068/d01k}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical perspectives==

===Ecofeminism===
[[Ecofeminism]] says that women are closer to nature than men are. This closeness, therefore, makes women more nurturing and caring towards their environment.  Ecofeminism encompasses a variety of views but has a focus of patriarchal oppression and the social constructions relating to women and the environment.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; Some indicate the biology of women as the reason behind the closeness, while others credit culture and historical factors.&lt;ref name=Agarwal2000&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agarwal, B.|year=2000|title= Conceptualising environmental collective action: why gender matters|journal=Cambridge Journal of Economics|volume=24|issue=3|pp=283–310|doi=10.1093/cje/24.3.283|url=http://binaagarwal.com/downloads/apapers/conceptualizing_environmental_collective_action.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ecofeminist believes in a direct connection between oppression of nature and the subordination of women. Vandana Shiva, is credited with bringing ecofeminism into public consciousness by her reports of the [[Chipko]] movement.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;
The Chipko movement also led to the formation of anti alcoholism.

===Environmental or ecological feminism===

Environmental or ecological feminism differs from ecofeminism in that it is more focused on the actual, specific interactions with the environment. Connections between environment and gender can be made by looking at the gender division of labor and environmental roles rather than an inherent connection with nature.&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt; The gender division of labor requires a more nurturing and caring role for women, therefore that caring nature places women closer with the environment.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; The knowledge of nature is shaped by the experiences an individual has.  Women have a distinct knowledge of the land, yet are excluded from policy decisions of development on that land.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; This is prominent in many developing countries where the responsibility of collecting fuel and fodder is placed upon the women.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; Both the resources and the meanings are taken into consideration with environmental feminism. There is a challenge to not only focus on the gender division of labor but also the actual appropriation methods of the resources.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; In other words, there is not simply an inherent connection between women and nature, rather there are material realities that exist.&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt; Bina Agarwal&lt;ref name=Agarwal1997&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agarwal, B.|year=1998|title=Gender and environment management in South Asia: can romanticized pasts help model desirable futures?|journal=Macalester International|volume=6|issue=1|url=http://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1132&amp;context=macintl}} Article 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt; opposes ecofeminism and outlines three problematic elements which are:
*Historical characterization of the situation of women and nature
*Linking of the emancipation of women with that of nature
*Assumptions about women's agency

====Criticism====
[[Bina Agarwal]] has critiqued the ideas of environmental feminism. She proposes problems with welfare, efficiency, and source of land. 
*Welfare

Due to gender differences in income-spending patterns, women are at a higher risk of living in poverty. For this reason, access to land is of special importance. Land access allows for a number of production advantages such as growing trees, fodder and/or crops.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www-fulcrum-org.libproxy.sdsu.edu/concern/monographs/bg257f65x|title=A Field of One's Own|last=Agarwal|first=Bina|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|isbn=0521418682|location=Cambridge, England|pages=pg. 32 &amp; pp.37-38}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, land access also allows for increased credit, bargaining power and strengthens aggregate real wages rates.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Even the smallest amount of land can have huge impacts on welfare directly as well as increasing entitlement to family welfare.&lt;ref name=Chada&gt;Chadha, G K (1992). Non-farm Sector in India's Rural Economy: Policy, Performance and Growth Prospects, mimeo, Centre for Regional Development, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi (1992), showed that households that owned land earned markedly more than landless households.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Efficiency
#Incentive effect: If women are given secure land rights, there will be a greater incentive for higher production rates.  Women will be motivated to use the best technologies, increase cultivation, and make long-term investments. Environmentally sound use of the land resource and reduced out-migration to cities by women and their dependents are other benefits of women’s secure land rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
#Credit and input access effect: "Titles would enhance women's ability to raise production by improving their access to agricultural credit, as well as by increasing women's independent access to output, savings and cash flow for reinvestment".&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;
#Efficiency of resource use effect: Studies have shown the possibility that women use resources more efficiently than men.  This could mean anything from making a more productive use of loans of money earned to the ability of women to achieve higher values of output based on cropping patterns.
#Gender specific knowledge and talent pool effect: Many women have specific and often greater knowledge about certain crops and planting patterns.  If women are included as farm managers, a more diverse and talented informed pool will be created.
#Bargaining power and empowerment effect: Providing women with the opportunity to own land will increase their sense of empowerment and could help women to assert themselves more in various situations such as policy creation other government schemes.

*Source of land
Because public land available for distribution is now quite limited, most of the land will need to come from private sectors.  "To get a share of land, therefore, it is critical for women to stake a claim in privatised land".&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;

===Feminist political ecology ===
Feminist political ecology builds from [[ecofeminism]] and environmental feminism and lays out three essential factors which are: 
# [[wiktionary:gendered knowledge|Gendered knowledge]], or the ways in which access to scientific and ecological knowledge is structured by gender (this is considered part of [[gender feminism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |subscription=yes |jstor=40435825|title=Public Affairs Quarterly Vol. 6, No. 4 |date=October 1992 |pages=435–456 |chapter=Multiculturalism and Epistemology |first=Steven |last=Yates |quote=Feminists offer their distinctive twist to this approach by saying that all knowledge and cognition are "gendered"; hence the term gender feminism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
# Gendered environmental rights and responsibilities, including differential access by men and women to various legal and de facto claims to land and resources.
#Gendered politics and grassroots activism, including an examination of women within and as leaders of environmental movements.&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt;

Feminist political ecology seeks to discover the role and place of women in environmental development on a political scale.&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt;

==In developed nations==

===Sweden===
Sweden has historically had a political culture that inherently protects the environment. Sweden is one of the highest-ranking countries when assessing gender equality, but the government does agree there is room for improvement. Women in Sweden have been empowered to protect the environment through the government and policies, a lot like other developed nations. In Sweden, the majority of local government workers are women at 64% and since the 2010 election, 45% of Swedish parliament is made up of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Equality in Sweden|url=https://sweden.se/society/gender-equality-in-sweden/|website=Government of Sweden|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has recognized that women are the most affected by climate change and environmental degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denton|first=Fatma|date=July 2002|title=Climate Change Vulnerability, Impacts, and Adaptation: Why Does Gender Matter?|url=https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.sdsu.edu/stable/4030569?seq=3#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Gender and Development|volume=10|pages=10-20|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this recognition they have committed to contribute to increasing the participation for women in decisions and policy debates surrounding climate change and other environmental issues. They also have committed to increasing resources for women in civil society who present issues about the environment, hoping to increase accountability and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government offices of Sweden|title=Policy for Environmental and Climate Issues in Swedish Development Cooperation|url=http://www.government.se/content/1/c6/15/64/98/24249736.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peterson and Merchant draw on the idea that the women's environmental movement in Sweden was based on both symbolic and political perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson &amp; Merchant|title='Peace with the Earth:' Women and the Environmental Movement in Sweden|journal=Women's Studies International Forum|date=1986|issue=9.5–6|pages=465–479}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early stages of the environmental movement and women’s movement in Sweden, women were very aware that changes had to be made both within society and ideologies, then enacted politically to create a cohesive collective society.

Elin Wagner (1882–1949) presented herself as a radical feminist in early movements. She was a writer, journalist, environmentalist, ecologist and pacifist. She was a large inspiration for the environmental and feminist movements. She saw a large flaw in the popular ideology after World War II: that men had the ability to control and conserve nature for the entire global community or all of mankind. With a place in both politics and writing, she was inspired to write her novel, ''Alarm Clock''. Her novel was barely noticed when released in 1941, but during Sweden's women's movement in the 1970s, her messages became a driving force behind the movement. She believed that there should be a large presence of intellectuals in social movements. Wagner and other key Swedish feminist scholars and intellectuals of that time shaped the parameters of Swedish thinking and both the environmental and women's movements. Throughout her life, Wagner stressed the importance of nature and the environment, an idea we see through the identity of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=A|title=Elin wägner and radical environmentalism in Sweden: The good earthworm|journal=Environmental History Review|date=1994|volume=18|issue=3|pages=59–74|jstor=3984710|doi=10.2307/3984710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden has it ingrained in both their identity and traditions to have a deep sense of nature, which has played a huge role in shaping the overall consensus of the country to protect the environment, especially for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Breiting &amp; Wickenberg|title=The progressive development of environmental education in Sweden and Denmark|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the transformation of the opinion and ideologies of the Swedish people, it became much easier to entrench environmental policies. Women working within institutions protected the global environment by pushing for bans on nuclear energy or industry degrading local environment. In 1980, there was a national referendum on nuclear power in Sweden. The voting patterns revealed that 43% of women were against nuclear power, while only 21% of men opposed it.&lt;ref name="Merchant1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merchant|first1=C|title=Earthcare: Women and the Environment|date=1996|location=New York|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden and the women of the country have demonstrated that environmental protection can be achieved through transitioning ideologies followed by institutional change.

==Women's attitude and the environment==
The deep connection between women and men comes from the daily interaction between them.{{citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion.|date=March 2009}} In recent decades, environmental movements have increased as the movements for women's rights have also increased.&lt;ref name = "Mellor"&gt;Mellor, Mary.(1997). Feminism &amp; Ecology. New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Today's union of nature preservation with [[women's rights]] and [[Women's liberation|liberation]] has stemmed from invasion of their rights in the past.&lt;ref name="Merchant1996"/&gt;

In developing areas of the world, women are considered the primary users of [[natural resources]] (Land, forest, and water), because they are the ones who are responsible for gathering food, fuel, and fodder.&lt;ref name= "Abzug"&gt;Abzug, Bella. (1995). Women and the Environment. International Authors Series. New York: The Department of Public Information.&lt;/ref&gt; Although in these countries, women mostly can't own the land and farms outright, they are the ones who spend most of their time working on the farms to feed the [[household]]. Shouldering this responsibility leads them to learn more about soil, plants, and trees and not misuse them. Although, technological inputs increase male involvement with land, many of them leave the farm to go to cities to find jobs; so women become increasingly responsible for an increasing portion of farm tasks.&lt;ref name="Jiggins, Janice 1994"&gt;Jiggins, Janice. (1994). Changing the Boundaries: Women-Centered Perspectives on population and the Environment. New York: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These rural women tend to have a closer relationship with land and other natural resources, which promotes a new culture of respectful use and preservation of natural resources and the environment, ensuring that the following generations can meet their needs.&lt;ref name = "Silent"&gt;From Silent Spring to vocal vanguard. (1997, January). United Nations Chronicle, 34(3), 35-38. Retrieved December 13, 2006, from ProQuest database.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides considering how to achieve appropriate [[agricultural]] production and human nutrition, women want to secure access to the land.&lt;ref name="Jiggins, Janice 1994"/&gt; Women's perspectives and values for the environment are somewhat different from men's. Women give greater priority to protection of and improving the capacity of nature, maintaining farming lands, and caring for nature and environment's future.&lt;ref name="Jiggins, Janice 1994"/&gt; Repeated studies have shown that women have a stake in environment, and this stake is reflected in the degree to which they care about natural resources. [[Ecofeminism]] refers to women's and feminist perspectives on the environment – where the domination and exploitation of women, of poorly resourced peoples and of nature is at the heart of the ecofeminist movement.

==Climate change and women==
Many of the environmental effects of climate change have disproportionately placed women in more vulnerable circumstances. Environmental occurrences that affect the activities women are found to be mainly responsible for in developing countries include increase in storm frequency and intensity, increase in floods, droughts, and fires. The Indian Government's National Action Plan on Climate Change said "The impacts of climate change could prove particularly severe for women. With climate change there would be increasing scarcity of water, reductions in yields of forest biomass, and increased risks to human health with children, women and the elderly in a household becoming the most vulnerable. ...special attention should be paid to the aspects of gender."&lt;ref name=arora&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jonsson-Arora|first1=Seema|title=Virtue and vulnerability: Discourses on women, gender and climate change|journal=Global Environmental Change|date=May 2011|volume=21|issue=2|pages=744–751|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the Pacific Islands and coastal areas of Asia women are strongly engaged in subsistence fishing as well as collection of food in local habitats. These habitats, such as [[mangroves]], [[seagrass]] beds, and [[lagoons]] are all being negatively influenced by a changing climate, creating barriers in the direct work of women which then ripple out to their community.&lt;ref name=ESCAP /&gt;

The subsequent response to the connection between women and climate change has evoked multiple responses in the policy realm.  Policy makers have shifted policy to reflect gender sensitive frameworks to address climate change.&lt;ref name=arora /&gt;
Arora-Jonsson argues that by focusing on the vulnerability of women in relation to climate change, it places more responsibility on women and shifts the narrative to ignore the root causes of the issue, power relations and institutional inequality.&lt;ref name=arora /&gt; The outcome of UN movements and policies for promoting women in areas impacted by climate change such as agriculture have not been scientifically proven to have any beneficial results on women communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Missing Women in Agriculture Reforms|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=2002|volume=37|issue=8|page=679-680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender and perception of the environment==
Given the environmental degradation caused while men have had dominance over women, and women's large investment in [[environmental sustainability]], some have theorized that women would protect the Earth better than men if in power. Although there is no evidence for this hypothesis, recent movements have shown that women are more sensitive to the earth and its problems. They have created a special [[value system]] about environmental issues. People's approaches to environmental issues may depend on their relationship with nature. Both women and nature have been considered as subordinates entities by men throughout history, which conveys a close affiliation between them.&lt;ref&gt;Wenz, Peter S. (2001). Environmental Ethics Today. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the perception of the natural environment between men and women differs: women tend to perceive natural resources in means of necessity, while men perceive it in means of "commercial entities or income generating tools." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academicresearchjournals.org/IJPSD/PDF/2016/April/Aditya.pdf|title=Role of Women in Environmental Conservation|last=Aditya|first=Sandeep Kumar|date=April 2016|website=Academic Research Journals|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, rural Indian women collect the dead branches which are cut by storm for fuel wood to use rather than cutting the live trees.&lt;ref&gt;Rodda, Annabel. (1991). Women and the Environment. New Jersey: Zed Books Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Since African, Asian, and Latin American women use the land to produce food for their family, they acquire the knowledge of the land/soil conditions, water, and other environmental features.&lt;ref name="Abzug" /&gt; Any changes in the environment on these areas, like deforestation, have the most effect on women of that area, and cause them to suffer until they can cope with these changes. One of the good examples would be the Nepali women whose grandmothers had to climb to the mountain to be able to bring in wood and fodder.&lt;ref name="Abzug" /&gt;

An example of female prominence in the defense of natural forests comes from India in 1906.  As forest clearing was expanding conflict between loggers and government and peasant communities increased. To thwart resistance to the forest clearing, the men were diverted from their villages to a fictional payment compensation site and loggers were sent to the forests. The women left in the villages, however, protested by physically hugging themselves to the trees to prevent their being cut down, giving rise to what is now called the [[Chipko movement]], an environmentalist movement initiated by these Indian women (which also is where the term tree-huggers originated).&lt;ref name="Breton, Mary J. 1998"&gt;Breton, Mary J. (1998). Women pioneers for the environment. Boston: Northeastern University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This conflict started because men wanted to cut the trees to use them for industrial purposes while women wanted to keep them since it was their food resource and deforestation was a survival matter for local people.&lt;ref name="Breton, Mary J. 1998" /&gt;

Gender-based commitments and movements such as [[feminism]] have reached to a new approach through the combination of feminism and [[environmentalism]] called [[Ecofeminism]]. Ecofeminists believe on the interconnection between the domination of women and nature. According to ecofeminism the superior power treats all subordinates the same. So, ecofeminism takes into account women subordination and nature degradation.&lt;ref name = "Mellor" /&gt; Remarking all these different reactions, one can see that however, most policy decision makers are men.

==Women environmentalists==

Her passion for environmental conservation lead her to found the Greenbelt Movement in 1977. Wangari Maathai's personal life was turbulent with divorce and jailings, as well as constant confrontations with the Kenyan government. Her push to protect national land from development made her less than favorable to Kenyan president [[Daniel arap Moi]], who served from 1978 to 2002.

=== Maria Cherkasova ===
[[Maria Cherkasova]] (b. 1938) is a [[Russia]]n journalist, ecologist, and director of [[Centre for Independent Ecological Programmers]] (CIEP). She is known for coordinating a 4-year campaign to stop construction of hydro-electric dam on the [[Katun River]]. After Cherkasova's involvement in the student movement on environmental protection in the 1960s, she began to work for the [[Red Data Book]] for the Department of Environmental Protection Institute. She researched and preserved rare species until she became the editor of [[USSR]] Red Data Book. She co-founded the [[Socio-Ecological Union]], which has become the largest ecological NGO in the former Soviet Union. In 1990, she became director of CIEP, which arrange and drives activities in an extensive range of ecologically related areas on both domestic and international fronts. Cherkasova recently has shifted her focus on protecting [[children's rights]] to live in a healthy environment and speaks for them both inside and outside Russia.&lt;ref name="Breton, Mary J. 1998" /&gt;

===Rachel Carson===
[[Rachel Carson]] (1907–1964) was an [[United States|American]] scientist, writer, and [[ecologist]]. Rachel Carson went to the Pennsylvania College for Women, majoring in English, but she was inspired by her [[biology]] teacher so she switched her major to biology. She became more interested and focused on the sea while she was working at the [[Marine Biological Laboratories in Massachusetts]]. Her eloquent prose let to the publication of her first book, ''[[Under the Sea Wind|Under the Sea-Wind: a Naturalists' Picture of Ocean Life]]'', in 1941. In 1949 she became chief editor of the [[Fish and Wildlife Service]] (FWS). Her second book, ''[[The Sea Around Us]]'', won the [[National Book Award]] and sold more than 200,000 copies. After that she retired from FWS and became a full-time writer. After her third and final book about the sea, ''The Edge of the Sea'', Carson focused on effects of chemicals and pesticides on the environment. That is when she wrote her book about environment, ''[[Silent Spring]]''. The book was about what man has done to the nature and eventually to himself, and started a modern environmental movement. Carson believed that humanity and nature are mutually dependent on each other. She argued that industrial activities such as [[pesticides]] use can damages the earth [[ecosystem]] and will have far-reaching ecological consequences such as future human health problems. Today, scientific studies have demonstrated these consequences.&lt;ref name="Breton, Mary J. 1998" /&gt;

=== Jane Goodall ===
[[Jane Goodall]] (b. 1934) is a female environmentalist most well known for her chimpanzee study, in which she lived among the primates. She became interested in animals as a young child and spent her early adulthood saving money to fund her dream of taking a trip to Africa. Her position as secretary to Louis Leakey led to her participation in several anthropological digs and animal studies, and eventually she was selected to study chimpanzee behavior in Tanzania. She made several discoveries about the behavior of chimpanzees on these studies and is credited with discovering the chimpanzee behavior of eating meet and creating tools. She published a book about the study entitled ''In the Shadow of Man''. She is also known for her activism, promoting the preservation of wild chimpanzee environments and opposing the use of animals in research. She has received numerous awards for her achievements and owns the Jane Goodall Institute for Wildlife Research, Education, and Conservation, a nonprofit organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/jane-goodall-9542363#accomplishments|title=Jane Goodall|last=|first=|date=|website=biography.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological movements initiated by women==

===Chipko movement===
One of the first environmentalist movement which was inspired by women was the [[Chipko movement]] (Women tree-huggers in India). "Its name comes from a Hindi word meaning "to stick" (as in glue). The movement was an act of defiance against the state government's permission given to a corporation for commercial logging. Women of the villages resisted, embracing trees to prevent their felling to safeguard their lifestyles which were dependent on the forests. Deforestation could qualitatively alter the lives of all village residents but it was the women who agitated for saving [End Page 163] the forests. Organized by a non-governmental organization that Chandi Prasad Bhatt led, the Chipko movement adopted the slogan "ecology is permanent economy". The women embracing the trees did not tag their action as feminist activism; however, as a movement that demonstrated resistance against oppression, it had all the markings of such."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Grewal, Jyoti|title=Theorizing Activism, Activizing Theory: Feminist Academics in Indian Punjabi Society|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=20|number=1|pages=161–183|date=Spring 2008|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nwsa_journal/v020/20.1.grewal.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It began when [[Maharajah]] of [[Jodhpur]] wanted to build a new palace in [[Rajasthan]], which is India's [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] foothills. While the [[Lumberjack|axemen]] were cutting the trees, martyr [[Amrita Devi]] hugged one of the trees. This is because in Jodhpur, each child had a tree that could talk to it. The axmen ignored Devi, and after taking her off the tree, cut it down. Her daughters are environmentalists like [[Chandi Prasad Bhatt]] and Sunderlal Bahuguna.

===Green Belt movement===
Another movement, which is one of the biggest in women and environmental history, is the [http://www.greenbeltmovement.org/ Green Belt movement]. [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Wangari Maathai]] founded this movement on the [[World Environment Day]] in June 1977.  The starting ceremony was very simple: a few women planted seven trees in Maathai's backyard. By 2005, 30 million trees had been planted by participants in the Green Belt movement on public and private lands. The Green Belt movement aims to bring environmental restoration along with society's economic growth. This movement led by Maathai focused on restoration of [[Kenya]]'s rapidly diminishing forests as well as empowering the rural women through environmental preservation, with a special emphasis on planting indigenous trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Belt Movement|date=2006|accessdate=November 15, 2006|url= http://www.wangarimaathai.or.ke/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muthuki|first=Janet|date=2006-01-01|title=Challenging patriarchal structures: Wangari Maathai and the Green Belt Movement in Kenya|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233277225_Challenging_patriarchal_structures_Wangari_Maathai_and_the_Green_Belt_Movement_in_Kenya|journal=Agenda|volume=20|pages=83–91|doi=10.1080/10130950.2006.9674752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Navdanya Movement===
[[Navdanya]] also known as the 'Nine Seeds Movement' seeks to empower local Indian farmers to move away from growing any [[genetically modified organism]] (GMOs) on their land and return to organic, [[chemical-free]] practices. This movement has reached over 5,000,000 Indian farmers and created over 65 seed banks around India.&lt;ref name="home"&gt;{{cite web|title=Navdanya|accessdate=March 5, 2012|url= http://www.navdanya.org/home}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navdanya fights to eliminate the [[commercialization of indigenous knowledge]] also known as 'Biopiracy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yamey, Gavin|title=The Bittersweet Sounds of the Modern Food Chain|journal=PLOS Biology|date=February 2006|volume=4|issue=2|pp=0165–0166|accessdate=March 5, 2012|url=http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0040047|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040047}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navdanya addresses multiple other international issues including climate change, food security, misapplication of technology, food sovereignty, fair trade, and many others.&lt;ref name="home"/&gt; This movement also created a learning center entitled Bija Vidyapeeth. Bija Vidyapeeth, in collaboration with Schumacher College in the United Kingdom, seeks to educate participants in sustainability and ecological principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Navdanya|accessdate=March 2, 2012|url= http://www.navdanya.org/earth-university}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kenyan land takeover===
In Kenya, starting in the mid-1980s, women protested against the elites and big foreign corporations who were coercing and controlling the production of the land.  Rather than allowing food to be grown for survival, women were pressured by both their husbands and the government to cultivate coffee for foreign profit. Protests continued and gained strength over the next couple of decades.  The protests eventually ended in a Kenyan power shift enforcing democratic national elections which resulted in redistribution of land possible.&lt;ref name=Perkins&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Perkins, E.|author2=Kuiper, E.|author3=Quiroga-Martínez, R.|author4=Turner, T.

'''Workplace listening''' is a type of [[active listening]] that is generally employed in a professional environment. Listening skills are imperative for career success, [[organizational effectiveness]], and worker satisfaction. Workplace listening includes understanding the listening process (i.e. perception, interpretation, evaluation, and action) and its barriers that hamper the flow of that process. Like other skills, there are specific techniques for improving workplace listening effectiveness. Moreover, it is imperative to become aware of the role of [[nonverbal communication]] in communicating in the workplace, as understanding messages wholly entails more than simple verbal messages.

'''Yu Hao''' ({{zh|c=喻皓}}, {{fl.}} 970) was an eminent [[History of China|Chinese]] [[structural engineer]] and [[architect]] during the [[Song Dynasty]] period (960–1279).

==Legacy==
Yu Hao was given the title of Master-Carpenter (Du Liao Jiang) for his architectural skill.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 81"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote the ''Mu Jing'' (木經; ''Timberwork Manual'') when he was active sometime between 965 to 995, considered an important piece of classical Chinese architectural literature, and although it no longer survives, [[Shen Kuo]] quoted from it.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 82"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In 989, his architectural design and [[structural engineering]] work culminated in the construction of the Kai-Bao Pagoda, a wooden [[Chinese pagoda]] of medieval [[Kaifeng]] (the Northern Song's capital city).&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 81"/&gt;&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 141"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; The pagoda was lost in a 1040 lightning conflagration, while the now famous [[Iron Pagoda]] of Kaifeng was rebuilt on the same spot in 1049, constructed out of brick and stone to resist arson and lightning fires.

==Timberwork Manual==

Writing a century later (c. 1088), the [[polymath]] scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031–1095) praised the architectural writings of Yu Hao. Below are two passages from Shen's book ''Meng Xi Bi Tan'' (''[[Dream Pool Essays]]''), outlining the basics contained in Yu's 10th century work on early Song-era architecture.

In the first quote, Shen Kuo describes a scene in which Yu Hao gives advice to another artisan architect about slanting [[strut]]s for diagonal wind bracing ([[Wade-Giles]] spelling):

{{cquote|When Mr. [[Qian Weiyan|Chhien (Wei-Yen)]] was Governor of the two [[Chekiang]] provinces, he authorized the building of a wooden pagoda at the Fan-Thien Ssu ([[Brahma]]-Heaven Temple) in [[Hangchow]] with a design of twice three stories. While it was under construction General Chhien went up to the top and was worried because it swayed a little. But the Master-Builder explained that as the tiles had not yet been put on, the upper part was still rather light, hence the effect. So then they put on all the tiles, but the sway continued as before. Being at a loss what to do, he privately sent his wife to see the wife of Yu Hao with a present of golden [[hairpin (fashion)|hair pin]]s, and enquire about the cause of the motion. (Yu) Hao laughed and said: 'That's easy, just fit in struts (pan) to settle the work, fixed with ([[iron]]) [[nail (fastener)|nails]], and it will not move any more.' The Master-Builder followed his advice, and the tower stood quite firm. This is because the nailed struts filled in and bound together (all the members) up and down so that the six planes (above and below, front and back, left and right) were mutually linked like the cage of the [[thorax]]. Although people might walk on the struts, the six planes grasped and supported each other, so naturally there could be no more motion. Everybody acknowledged the expertise thus shown.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 141"/&gt;}}

In this next quote, Shen Kuo describes the dimensions and types of architecture outlined in Yu Hao's book (Wade-Giles spelling):

{{cquote|Methods of building construction are described in the ''Timberwork Manual'', which, some say, was written by Yu Hao. (According to that book), buildings have three basic units of proportion (fen), what is above the cross-beams follows the Upperwork Unit, what is above the ground floor follows the Middlework Unit, and everything below that (platforms, foundations, paving, etc.) follows the Lowerwork Unit. The length of the cross-beams will naturally govern the lengths of the uppermost cross-beams as well as the rafters, etc. Thus for a (main) cross-beam of (8&amp;nbsp;ft.) length, an uppermost cross-beam of (3.5&amp;nbsp;ft.) length will be needed. (The proportions are maintained) in larger and smaller halls. This (2/28) is the Upperwork Unit. Similarly, the dimensions of the foundations must match the dimensions of the columns to be used, as also those of the (side-) [[rafter]]s, etc. For example, a column (11&amp;nbsp;ft.) high will need a platform (4.5&amp;nbsp;ft.) high. So also for all the other components, [[corbel]]led brackets (kung), projecting rafters (tshui), other rafters (chueh), all have their fixed proportions. All these follow the Middlework Unit (2/24). Now below of ramps (and steps) there are three kinds, steep, easy-going, and intermediate. In places these gradients are based upon a unit derived from the imperial litters. Steep ramps (chun tao) are ramps for ascending which the leading and trailing bearers have to extend their arms fully down and up respectively (ratio 3/35). Easy-going ramps (man tao) are those for which the leaders use elbow length and the trailers shoulder height (ratio 1/38); intermediate ones (phing tao) are negotiated by the leaders with downstretched arms and trailers at shoulder height (ratio 2/18). These are the Lowerwork Units. The book (of Yu Hao) had three chapters. But builders (thu mu chih kung) in recent years have become much more precise and skillful (yen shan) than formerly. Thus for some time past the old Timberwork Manual has fallen out of use. But (unfortunately) there is hardly anybody capable of writing a new one. To do that would be a masterpiece in itself!&lt;ref name="Needham volume 4 82 84"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, 82-84.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
