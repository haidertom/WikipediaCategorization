Dr. '''Abdel-Moniem ibn Ali El-Ganayni ''' ({{lang-ar|عبد المنعم بن علي الجنايني}}) is an [[Egypt]]ian-born [[United States|American]] [[nuclear physicist]], former prison [[Imam]], and an active member of the [[Pittsburgh]] [[Muslim]] community.  In 2007 El-Ganayni's U.S. [[security clearance]] was revoked, and he subsequently lost his job as a senior scientist at [[Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory]].

==Biography==
El-Ganayni was born in Minyat Samannoud, [[Egypt]] in 1950. His father, Sheikh Ali ibn Abdel-Moniem El-Ganayni (الشيخ علي بن عبدالمنعم الجنايني) was educated at the prestigious [[Al-Azhar University]], where he completed his elementary, secondary, and high school studies. Sheikh Ali proceeded to the Al-Azhar Faculty of [[Islamic Law]], where he completed the equivalent of a [[bachelor’s degree]]. He continued his studies to the graduate level, obtaining the equivalent of a [[Ph.D.]] in Islamic law (العالمية), and later a certification to practice law (إجازة القضاء الشرعي).

In 1973, Dr. Abdel-Moniem El-Ganayni obtained his Bachelor of Science in [[Physics]] from [[Ain Shams University]] in [[Cairo]], Egypt. He went on to pursue a [[Master's degree|master's]] in Nuclear Physics and completed his degree in 1978.

In 1980 El-Ganayni moved to the United States to complete his Ph.D., obtaining a second master's degree in Nuclear Physics from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1983.  Between 1984 and 1989 El-Ganayni worked as a teaching assistant in the Department of Physics, and completed his Ph.D. in Atomic Physics in 1990. He became an American citizen in 1988.

Shortly after completing his graduate studies, El-Ganayni was hired by [[Westinghouse Electric Company]], working in the Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory as a Senior Scientific Programmer, and later as a Senior Scientist. Throughout his employment at Bettis he received positive reviews, authored and coauthored a number of academic papers, and contributed to numerous projects.

El-Ganayni’s contributions were not limited to scientific endeavors; he is a founding member of the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh, served two terms as the center’s president, and helped to establish the mosque’s current location in Schenley Heights. For close to a decade, El-Ganayni worked and volunteered as an Imam at correctional facilities in both [[Ohio]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. Part of El-Ganayni’s prison outreach included the creation of the PA DOC Monitor, a website examining the condition, and necessary reform of the Department of Corrections.

== Loss of Security Clearance, Employment ==

Dr. El-Ganayni’s work at Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory required the possession of a [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) issued security clearance, enabling him to work with [[classified information]].  In October 2007 El-Ganayni’s security clearance was suspended,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Memorandum_Order.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024211834/http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Memorandum_Order.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; effectively barring him from any work at Bettis.  DOE regulations stipulate that an individual may appeal a suspension, however El-Ganayni’s right to appeal was denied in May 2008 when Jeffery F. Kupfer, deputy secretary of the DOE, invoked [[national security]], refusing to reveal the government’s allegations against Dr. El-Ganayni.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08179/893014-55.stm] - Muslim sues over loss of security clearance&lt;/ref&gt;

The suspension of El-Ganayni’s security clearance was prefaced by an interview with DOE security officials, and later the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI).  In these interviews, questions were asked regarding El-Ganayni’s political beliefs, religious views, and his work as an Imam in the prison system.  No questions related to his work or any potential breaches of security were asked in either interview.

The DOE officials instead focused on a seemingly innocent Islamic book entitled, “The Miracle of the Ant,” authored by [[Turkey|Turkish]] Islamic publisher and author [[Harun Yahya]]; unbeknownst to El-Ganayni, the content of Yahya’s book was largely, if not completely duplicated from a [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning work entitled, “[[Journey to the Ants]]” published by [[Harvard University Press]].

Dr. El-Ganayni distributed excerpts from book to prisoners (both Muslim and non-Muslim) while serving as an Imam at Forest State Correctional Institution.  DOE officials expressed concern over a purely scientific description of ants’ biological defense mechanisms in a chapter entitled, “Defense and War Tactics” insinuating that El-Ganayni distributed this material with sinister intent, and subsequently questioned his allegiance to the United States of America.  His supervisor at Forest, chaplaincy director Glenn McQuown reviewed the book and described it as “completely benign.”

The interviews also focused on El-Ganayni’s criticism of American [[foreign policy]] and the FBI’s mistreatment of Muslims after [[September 11, 2001]].  Specifically, El-Ganayni raised concern over an FBI raid of a Pittsburgh mosque during Friday prayers, where attendees were searched and forced to stand outside while being questioned.  Revocation of El-Ganayni’s security clearance also may be related to his establishment of the PA DOC Monitor, a website and prison outreach program which critically examines the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections and its policies, insisting that drastic reform of the system is required for it to truly benefit prisoners and society at large.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08034/854427-85.stm] - Nuclear physicist/Muslim cleric fights to get job back, security clearance&lt;/ref&gt;

== El-Ganayni vs. the United States Department of Energy et al.. ==

On June 26, 2008 the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) with Schnader, Harrison, Segal, and Lewis as co-counsels filed a lawsuit on behalf of Dr. El-Ganayni alleging that the DOE revoked his clearance due to criticism of the FBI and U.S. foreign policy. The suit demands that the DOE reveal their allegations against El-Ganayni and restore due process, allowing him to contest any allegations made against him.  A hearing date has not been set as of July 28, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aclupa.org/pressroom/governmentrevokedmuslimnuc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080903064152/http://aclupa.org/pressroom/governmentrevokedmuslimnuc.htm |archivedate=2008-09-03 |df= }} - Government Revoked Muslim Nuclear Physicist’s Security Clearance to Retaliate for Criticism of U.S. Policy, says ACLU&lt;/ref&gt;

A motion  for preliminary and permanent injunction against the U.S. Department of Energy and its acting director, Jeffrey Kupfer was filed on September 3, 2008 requesting the following:

* Assert that the court has jurisdiction over the case.
* Order the Energy Department to show Dr. El-Ganayni the evidence it claims to have against him.
* Order the Energy Department to hold a hearing where he can tell his side of the story, as provided in the agency's own rules for inquiries on sensitive security matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aclupa.org/pressroom/governmentrevokedmuslimnuc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080903064152/http://aclupa.org/pressroom/governmentrevokedmuslimnuc.htm |archivedate=2008-09-03 |df= }} - Muslim scientist asks judge to order hearing&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 25, 2008 the DOE filed a motion to dismiss El-Ganayni's preliminary and permanent injunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Govt_Motion_to_Dismiss_And_Oppose.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219125734/http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Govt_Motion_to_Dismiss_And_Oppose.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-19 |df= }} - DOE Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss and in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Permanent Injunction&lt;/ref&gt; On October 14, 2008 Dr. El-Ganayni's attorneys filed a brief in opposition of the DOE's motion to dismiss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Brief_in_Opposition_to_Motion_to_Dismiss.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024195257/http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Brief_in_Opposition_to_Motion_to_Dismiss.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-24 |df= }} - Brief in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 31, 2008 Judge Terrence F. McVerry stated that the court "reluctantly concludes that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims made in Counts I and II of the Complaint" effectively granting the DOE's Motion to Dismiss in relation to Counts I and II.  However, the court requested supplemental briefing regarding Count III, specifically concerning the DOE's interpretation, application, and adherence to executive procedure.  Briefs from both the DOE and El-Ganayni's defense regarding Count III were submitted on November 14, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Memorandum_Order.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024211834/http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Memorandum_Order.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-24 |df= }} -Memorandum 10-31-2008 in reference to DOE's motion to dismiss&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge McVerry ruled in favor of Dr. El-Ganayni and refused to dismiss Count III on November 20, 2008.  In his court order McVerry stated that, "[the] Defendants’ interpretation [of their own regulations] is not consistent with the actual text of the Executive Orders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Order_denying_Motion_to_Dismiss_Count_III.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025002453/http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Order_denying_Motion_to_Dismiss_Count_III.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This ruling was based on a DOE regulation stating that a clearance can only be revoked by a DOE agency head, not simply a Deputy Secretary.  Subsequently, November 24, 2008, a day before a scheduled hearing to discuss pending motions, future direction of the litigation, and the possible scheduling of a preliminary injunction hearing, DOE secretary Samuel Bodman signed a revocation of El-Ganayni's clearance citing national security and the government requested a dismissal of the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Notice_of_Filing.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025002534/http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Notice_of_Filing.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This dismissal was granted ,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Memorandum_Order_11_25_08.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025002852/http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Memorandum_Order_11_25_08.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; however Dr. El-Ganayni appealed his case to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court.&lt;ref name="post-gazette.com"&gt;http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08333/931314-52.stm&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. El-Ganayni's brief for appeal of the dismissal was filed March 19, 2009 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Brief_for_Appeal_from_Grant_of_Motion_to_Dismiss.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025170032/http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Brief_for_Appeal_from_Grant_of_Motion_to_Dismiss.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a decision was made in the DOE's favor on January 11, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/3rd-circuit-opinion.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605000106/http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/3rd-circuit-opinion.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In summation, the judges stated that the DOE is by extension part of the government's Executive Branch, and therefore the 3rd Circuit has no jurisdiction over the matter.

== Leaving the United States ==

On November 26, 2008 El-Ganayni and his wife left to Egypt after residing in the United States for 28 years.  El-Ganayni stated that he would rather return to his birthplace than live in America as a second-class citizen and that he "feel[s] very sad that the American people have lost a good bit of their Constitution," quoting John Adams who said, "once you lose your rights and liberties, it's very hard to get them back."&lt;ref name="post-gazette.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2851">'''All-over painting''' refers to the non-differential treatment of the surface of a work of two-dimensional art, for instance a painting. This concept is most popularly thought of as emerging in relation to the so-called "drip" paintings of [[Jackson Pollock]] and the "automatic writing" or "abstract calligraphy" of [[Mark Tobey]] in the 1950s, though the applicability of the term all-over painting would be wider than that. "All-over painting" is not a formal style of painting and the term does not represent an "[[art movement]]." Some painting under the heading [[color field]] painting displays the "all-over" painting style. Such a painting would fail to treat the top, for instance, differently from the bottom; the left than the right. Uniform treatment of all sections of the surface are the hallmark of all-over painting. All-over paintings would lack a dominant point of interest, or any indication of which way is "up." Some paintings by [[Cy Twombly]] have had this term applied to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O5-alloverpainting.html |title=all-over painting Facts, information, pictures &amp;#124; Encyclopedia.com articles about all-over painting |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/all-over-painting ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007141533/http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/all-over-painting |date=October 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artprofessor.com/art-movements/all-over-painting.php |title=All-over Painting |publisher=Artprofessor.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Al.html |title=ArtLex's Al-Am page |publisher=Artlex.com |date=2007-02-16 |accessdate=2012-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705050409/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Al.html |archive-date=2012-07-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/library/00/0019/t001940.asp |title=Directory of Art Services and Resources |publisher=artnet |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Amour de soi''''' (French, "self-love") is a concept in the philosophy of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] that refers to the kind of [[self-love]] that humans share with brute animals and predates the appearance of society. Acts committed out of ''amour de soi'' tend to be for individual well-being. They are naturally good and not malicious because ''amour de soi'' as self-love does not involve pursuing one's self-interest at the expense of others. The sentiment does not compare oneself with others, but is concerned solely with regarding oneself as an absolute and valuable existence. It is related to an awareness of one's future and can restrain present impulse. Rousseau contrasts it with ''[[amour-propre]]'', that kind of self-love, found in [[Thomas Hobbes]]' philosophy, in which one's opinion of oneself is dependent on what other people think and which arises only with society.

Rousseau suggested that ''amour de soi'' was lost during the transition from the pre-societal condition to society, but it can be restored by the use of "good" institutions created with the [[social contract]]. This renewed passage from the [[state of nature]] to the civilized state, would bring man to favor [[justice]] instead of [[instinct]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Derathé, ''Jean-Jacques Rousseau et la science politique de son temps'', Paris, Librairie Philosophique J. Vrin, 1995, pp. 135-141.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59726">The '''British undergraduate degree classification''' system is a [[Grade (education)|grading]] structure for [[undergraduate degree]]s or [[bachelor's degree]]s and [[Master's degree#Integrated Masters Degree|integrated master's degrees]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The system has been applied (sometimes with significant variations) in other countries and regions.

== History ==
In the 16th century, the [[Regius Professor of Divinity]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] implemented [[Norm-referenced test|norm referencing]] to distinguish the top 25% of candidates, the next 50%, and the bottom 25%.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

The classification system as currently used in the United Kingdom was developed in 1918. Honours were then a means to recognise individuals who demonstrated depth of knowledge or originality, as opposed to relative achievement in examination conditions.

Recently{{when|date=September 2018}}, there has been concern over possible [[grade inflation]] due to increasing numbers of higher-class honours degrees awarded per annum. The number of first-class honours degrees has reportedly tripled since the 1990s. As with claimed grade inflation of [[GCE Advanced Level|A-levels]], prospective employers or educational institutions have observed increased difficulty in selecting candidates. It is, however, unknown whether the rise in the number of first-class degrees is due to grade inflation or whether students are achieving higher levels than in the past. University leaders have also pointed at the higher A-levels attained by students as evidence that higher degree grades should be expected. On the other hand, the practice of degree classification has been criticised for unduly stigmatising students and being unreflective of a graduate's success or potential for success, particularly in the workplace.

== Degree classification ==
A bachelor's degree can be an ''[[honours degree]]'' (bachelor's with honours) or an ''ordinary degree'' (bachelor's without honours). Honours degrees are classified, usually based on a [[weighted average]] (with higher weight given to marks in the later years of the course, and often zero weight to those in the first year) of the marks gained in exams and other assessments. Grade boundaries can vary by institution, but typical values are given below.

* First-class honours (1st, 1 or I) – typically 70% or higher
* Second-class honours;
** Upper division (2:1, 2i or II-1) – typically 60–69%
** Lower division (2:2, 2ii or II-2) – typically 50–59%
* Third-class honours (3rd, 3 or III) – typically 40–49%

Students who do not achieve honours may be awarded an ordinary degree, sometimes known as a "pass". Ordinary degrees, and other exit awards such as the [[Diploma of Higher Education]] (DipHE; for completing the first two years of a degree course) and [[Certificate of Higher Education]] (CertHE; for completing the first year of a degree course), may be unclassified (pass/fail) or, particularly in Scotland where the ordinary degree is offered as a qualification in its own right, classified into pass, merit and distinction. [[Foundation degree]]s are normally classified into pass, merit and distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.hull.ac.uk/fass/school-of-languages,-linguisti/undergraduate-study/student-handbook/general-university-regulations/your-degree-classification.aspx|title=Your degree classification|work=Student Handbook: General University Regulations|publisher=[[University of Hull]]|accessdate=16 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217142841/http://www2.hull.ac.uk/fass/school-of-languages,-linguisti/undergraduate-study/student-handbook/general-university-regulations/your-degree-classification.aspx|archivedate=17 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/academicservices/qualitymanual/assessmentandawards/degree-classification.aspx|title=Degree classification|publisher=[[University of Nottingham]]|accessdate=16 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218063419/https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/academicservices/qualitymanual/assessmentandawards/degree-classification.aspx|archivedate=18 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrated master's degrees are usually classified with honours in the same way as a bachelor's honours degree, although some integrated master's degrees are classified like postgraduate taught master's degrees into pass (usually 50%), merit (60%) and distinction (70%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.postgrad.com/advice/masters_programs/masters_degree_grades/|title=Masters Degree Grades|website=Postgrad.com|accessdate=16 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217143015/https://www.postgrad.com/advice/masters_programs/masters_degree_grades/|archivedate=17 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.uwe.ac.uk/students/academicadvice/degreeclassification.aspx|title=Degree classification|publisher=[[University of the West of England]]|accessdate=16 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217142754/http://www1.uwe.ac.uk/students/academicadvice/degreeclassification.aspx|archivedate=17 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At most institutions, the system allows a small amount of discretion.&lt;ref name="Seaton"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/apr/18/higher-education-degree-classification|title=Degree classification is unfair to many students|last=Seaton|first=Nigel|date=19 April 2011|work=The Guardian|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202005614/https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/apr/18/higher-education-degree-classification|archivedate=2 December 2016|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A candidate may be elevated to the next degree class if his or her average marks are close to (or the [[median]] of their weighted marks achieves) the higher class, and if they have submitted several pieces of work worthy of the higher class.  However, even students with a high average mark may be unable to take honours if they have failed part of the course and so have insufficient credits.

In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, a bachelor's degree with honours normally takes three years of full-time study and usually requires 360 [[credit accumulation and transfer scheme|credits]], of which at least 90 are at level 6 (final year of a bachelor's degree) level, while an ordinary bachelor's degree normally requires 300 credits, of which 60 are at level 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/publications/information-and-guidance/publication?PubID=2730#.WKWxz6gXZoM|title=Higher education credit framework for England: guidance on academic credit arrangements in higher education in England|isbn=9781844828708|publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency]]|date=August 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817191542/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/publications/information-and-guidance/publication?PubID=2730#.WKWxz6gXZoM|archivedate=17 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland, the honours bachelor's degree takes four years and requires 480 credits with a minimum of 90 at level 10 of the Scottish framework (last year of the honours degree) and 90 at level 9 (penultimate year), while the ordinary degree takes three years and requires 360 credits with a minimum of 60 at level 9 (last year of the ordinary degree).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scqf.org.uk/framework-diagram/Framework.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140616065231/http://scqf.org.uk/framework-diagram/Framework.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 June 2014|title=Interactive framework|accessdate=16 February 2017|publisher=SCQF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland, it is possible to start university a year younger than in the rest of the United Kingdom, as the Scottish [[Higher (Scottish)|Higher exams]] are often taken at age 16 or 17 (as opposed to 18), so Scottish students often end a four-year course at the same age as a student from elsewhere in the UK taking a three-year course, assuming no [[gap year]]s or students skipping the first year (direct entry to 2nd year).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/direct-entry/|title=Direct entry to second year {{!}} University of St Andrews|website=www.st-andrews.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a candidate is awarded a degree with honours, "(Hons)" may be suffixed to their designatory letters — for example, BA (Hons), BSc (Hons), BMus (Hons), MA (Hons).&lt;ref name=Eurydice&gt;{{cite web|url=https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/eurydice/index.php/United-Kingdom-England:Bachelor#Certification|title=Bachelor|at=Certification|website=Eurydice|publisher=[[European Commission]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220094322/https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/eurydice/index.php/United-Kingdom-England:Bachelor#Certification|archivedate=20 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; An MA (Hons) would generally indicate a degree award from certain Scottish universities (c.f. [[Scottish MA]]) and is at the same level as a bachelor's degree. 
 
===Distribution of classes===

The [[Higher Education Statistics Agency]] (HESA) has published the number of degrees awarded with different classifications since 1994/5. The relative proportions of different classes have changed over this period, with increasing numbers of students being awarded higher honours. The table below shows the percentage of classified degrees (i.e. not including fails or unclassified degrees such as [[MBBS]]) in each class at five year intervals; note that HESA stopped giving statistics separately for third class honours and pass degree after 2003 and that a small number of undivided second class honours degrees (shown under "other" along with "unknown", which makes up the bulk of this category) were awarded up to 1996.

===First-class honours===
First-class honours, referred to as a "first", is the highest honours classification and indicates high academic achievement.

In 2010 and 2011, the [[Higher Education Statistics Agency]] (HESA) reported that approximately 15% of all degree candidates graduated with first-class honours.&lt;ref name="Shepherd 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2012/jan/12/first-class-degrees-concern|title=Is the number of first-class degrees cause for concern?|work=The Guardian|accessdate=30 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404024912/http://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2012/jan/12/first-class-degrees-concern|archivedate=4 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HESA"&gt;[[Higher Education Statistics Agency]].

===Upper second-class honours {{anchor|Second-class honours}}===
{{Redirects here|2:1|an aspect ratio|Univisium}}
The upper division is commonly abbreviated to "2:1" or "II.i" (pronounced ''two-one'').  The 2:1 is a minimum requirement for entry to many postgraduate courses in the UK.  It is also required for the award of a [[research council]] postgraduate studentship in the UK, although possession of a master's degree can render a candidate eligible for an award if their initial degree was below the 2:1 standard.
The percentage of candidates who achieve upper second-class honours can vary widely by degree subject, as well as by university.&lt;ref name="HESA"/&gt;

===Lower second-class honours===
This is the lower division of second-class degrees and is abbreviated as "2:2" or "II.ii" (pronounced ''two-two''). It is also informally known as a "Desmond", named after [[Desmond Tutu]].

===Third-class honours===
Third-class honours, referred to as a "third", is the lowest honours classification in most modern universities. Historically, the University of Oxford awarded fourth-class honours degrees and, until the late 1970s, did not distinguish between upper and lower second-class honours degrees.&lt;ref name="Alderman"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/oct/14/administration.highereducation|title=Tear up the class system|first=Geoffrey|last=Alderman|work=The Guardian|accessdate=31 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231000647/http://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/oct/14/administration.highereducation|archivedate=31 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Informally, the third-class honours degree is referred to as a "gentleman's degree" (''cf.'' the "gentleman's C" in the U.S.).&lt;ref name="Henley"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/shortcuts/2012/jul/04/dont-judge-job-applicant-by-degree|title=Don't judge a job applicant by their degree|first=Jon|last=Henley|work=The Guardian|date=5 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228211719/https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/shortcuts/2012/jul/04/dont-judge-job-applicant-by-degree|archivedate=28 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 7.2% of students graduating in 2006 with an honours degree received a third-class honours.&lt;ref name="HESA"/&gt;

===Ordinary degree===
While most university bachelor's degree courses lead to honours degrees, some universities offer courses leading to ordinary degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucas.com/ucas/undergraduate/getting-started/international-and-eu-students/ucas-terms-explained|title=UCAS terms explained|publisher=[[UCAS]]|accessdate=16 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217142621/https://www.ucas.com/ucas/undergraduate/getting-started/international-and-eu-students/ucas-terms-explained|archivedate=17 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some honours courses permit students who do not gain sufficient credits in a year by a small margin to transfer to a parallel ordinary degree course. Ordinary degrees may also sometimes be awarded to honours degree students who do not pass sufficient credits in their final year to gain an honours degree, but pass enough to earn an ordinary degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/faculty.handbook/faqs/?faqno=552|title=Faculty Handbook Online 2013/14: Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Durham University|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107040202/https://www.dur.ac.uk/faculty.handbook/faqs/?faqno=552|archivedate=7 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Scottish universities offer three-year ordinary degrees as a qualification in their own right, as well as an honours degree over four years. This is in contrast to English universities that have honours degrees with three years of study. An ordinary degree in Scotland is not a failed honours degree, as in certain English universities. Students can decide, usually at the end of their second or third year, whether or not they wish to complete a fourth honours year. Scottish universities may also award their ordinary degrees with distinction if a student achieves a particularly good grade average, usually 70% or above. A common example of a Scottish ordinary degree is the [[Bachelor of Laws]] course taken by graduates of other subjects, as this is sufficient (without honours) for entry into the legal profession. In other countries, Malawi for example, Mzuzu University offers four year ordinary degrees. The degree follows the same classification as those in the United Kingdom. Grades attained in the last two years ( year three and four) including internship and dissertation, contribute to the final degree classification.

===Variations in classification===

At the [[University of Cambridge]], undergraduate [[Tripos]] examinations are split into three parts (e.g. Part IA, IB, and II), or two parts (Part I and II). Part II is taken at the end of final year. Each student receives a formal classification for each part (i.e. Class I, II.I, II.II, or III).&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/camdata/tripos.html|title=The structure of undergraduate courses at the University of Cambridge|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509185935/http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/camdata/tripos.html|archivedate=9 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the Part II grade that corresponds with final examinations is quoted, but officially a grade simply exists for every Part of the degree, not for the overall degree.

At the [[University of Oxford]], a formal degree Class is given, and this is typically based on the final examinations. In Oxford, examinations for [[Prelims]] or [[Honour Moderations]] are also undertaken in first/second year, but these results do not typically affect the final degree classification. Until the 1970s, the four honours divisions in Oxford's moderations and final examinations were named first, second, third and fourth class, but eventually Oxford gave in and adopted the numbering used by other English universities.&lt;ref name="Alderman"/&gt;

====Variations of first-class honours====

At the [[University of Cambridge]], Triposes were previously split into two parts: Part I and Part II. Attaining First Class Honours in both parts would culminate in graduating with a "Double First".&lt;ref name="Cambridge"/&gt; Most Triposes were later split into three parts: "Part IA," "Part IB" and "Part II", or "Part I", "Part IIA" and "Part IIB". Attaining a First Class in all three parts culminates in graduating with a "Triple First".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/archaeology-and-anthropology-careers-and-talks/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819042048/http://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/archaeology-and-anthropology-careers-and-talks/ |archivedate=19 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/cv.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415040644/http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/cv.pdf |archivedate=15 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/once_a_caian._issue_8.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818193029/https://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/once_a_caian._issue_8.pdf |archivedate=18 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.society.caths.cam.ac.uk/Public_Magazines/1950r.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006040604/http://www.society.caths.cam.ac.uk/Public_Magazines/1950r.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrJp7LU5NL0C&amp;pg=PA318&amp;lpg=PA318&amp;ots=tNDjILyHrR&amp;sig=Uyi7UKpQrt6xVhqGS5o07Auy59I&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiUs-KwkqPOAhVkIcAKHWtPDWM4HhDoAQg4MAU&amp;q=%22triple+first%22+cambridge|title=Musik im Exil: die Schweiz und das Ausland 1918-1945|first1=Chris|last1=Walton|first2=Antonio|last2=Baldassarre|date=29 December 2017|publisher=Peter Lang|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeeyetrust.org.uk/keithmartin.html|title=Cambridge Eye Trust - Professor Keith Martin|first=Peter|last=Watson|website=www.cambridgeeyetrust.org.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819052951/http://www.cambridgeeyetrust.org.uk/keithmartin.html|archivedate=19 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frequency of this honour varies with subject, but typically fewer than 3% of students will achieve this distinction.

At [[University College London]], candidates who perform well beyond the requirements of a standard First Class Honours may be nominated to the [[Dean's List]].

===South Africa===
The South African Qualifications Authority&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saqa.org.za/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816121445/http://www.saqa.org.za/ |archivedate=16 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (SAQA) compares international degrees with local degrees before any international student continues their studies in that country.  While the British degree accreditation and classification system allows students to go straight from a three-year bachelor's degree onto a master's degree (normally requiring a 1st or a 2:1 – those with a 2:2 or a 3rd usually require appropriate professional experience),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.prospects.ac.uk/postgraduate-study/masters-degrees/should-i-do-a-masters|title=Should I do a Masters?|publisher=Prospects|at=Can I do a Masters with a 2:2 or a third?|accessdate=15 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216132355/https://www.prospects.ac.uk/postgraduate-study/masters-degrees/should-i-do-a-masters|archivedate=16 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa does not do so unless the student has proven research capabilities.  South African Honours degrees prepare the students to undertake a research-specific degree (in terms of master's), by spending an in-depth year (up to 5 modules) creating research proposals and undertaking a research project of limited scope.  This prepares students for the research degrees later in their academic career.

NUFFIC also noted that the grading culture is different in the Netherlands, so that it is very rare for even the best students in the Netherlands to be awarded a 9 or a 10, which represent near perfection and absolute perfection.&lt;ref name="Nuffic"/&gt;

===United States and Canada===

British honours degrees are sometimes considered equivalent (by British sources) to a US master's degree, with the US bachelor's degree being equivalent to a British pass degree, due to the much higher degree of specialisation in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quality and standards|chapter=Appendix 5: Higher education in other countries|url=https://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/ncihe/a5_083.htm|quote=7.21 The team gained the impression, based on an inspection of syllabuses and examination papers, that the American high school diploma compares in standard with GCSE and the associate degree with GCE A-level and Advanced GNVQ, the bachelor’s degree with a UK pass degree or higher national diploma and the Master’s degree with a bachelor’s honours degree from a British university. Further evidence for this conclusion: Howard University in Washington, a university in which over 99 per cent of undergraduates are black, admits overseas applicants from the West Indies with five GCE O-level grades at A-C to the freshman year of their bachelor’s degree programme; Johns Hopkins, one of the most prestigious of the private universities, states in its prospectus that advanced placement is available for students entering with either International Baccalauréat or GCE A-level. The rider must be added, however, that an American education is very much more general than a UK education right up to bachelor’s level; it would hardly be reasonable, therefore, to expect the same standard to be reached in the major subject. It was also noted that, in the highest quality institutions, some individual modules taken by senior students compared well in level with UK final honours standard. A given student would take rather fewer of these more demanding modules than a UK student, however.|work=[[Dearing Report|The National Committee of Enquiry into Higher Education (Dearing Report)]]|author=[[Ronald Dearing, Baron Dearing|Ron Dearing]]|date=23 July 1997|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024033713/http://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/ncihe/a5_083.htm|archivedate=24 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcouncil.org:80/eis/quusa.htm|title=Comparing your US qualifications with those in the UK|publisher=[[British Council]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021001135341/http://www.britishcouncil.org/eis/quusa.htm|archive-date=1 October 2002|quote=Master's degree - in terms of specialisation, the American Master's degree from prestigious colleges and universities is considered comparable to the British Bachelor (Honours) degree. Candidates who have followed academically rigorous programmes have reached a standard comparable to that of a British taught Master's degree.|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many British institutions accept US bachelor's degrees for admission to postgraduate study (see below) and US comparison services treat British and American degrees as equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wenr.wes.org/2016/02/education-in-the-u-k|title=Education in the U.K.|publisher=[[World Education Services]]|date=2 February 2016|accessdate=26 May 2017|quote=The programs result in degrees such as the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Engineering, Bachelor of Laws, and Bachelor of Education, all of which are equivalent to a bachelor’s degree in the U.S. system.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030191855/http://wenr.wes.org/2016/02/education-in-the-u-k|archivedate=30 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When US bachelor's degrees are compared to British honours degrees, equivalencies can be expressed in terms of either [[Academic grading in the United States#Grade point average|US Grade Point Averages]] (GPAs) or letter grades.

British institutions normally state equivalence in terms of GPAs. Approximate mappings between British classifications and GPAs can be inferred from the graduate admissions criteria used by British universities, which often give international equivalents. For example, [[University College London]] (UCL)  equates the minimum classification for entrance to GPAs using 1st = 3.6, 2:1 = 3.3 and 2:2 = 3.0.&lt;ref name="UCL GPA"&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate-study/application-admission/general-entrance-requirement General entrance requirements], ''[[University College London]]'' {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/68jMWWbvT?url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate-study/application-admission/general-entrance-requirement |date=27 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, different universities convert grades differently: the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]] (LSE) considers a GPA (U.S.) of 3.5 or better as equivalent to gaining a 2:1,&lt;ref name="LSE entrance requirement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/graduateProspectus2010/entryRequirements/Home.aspx#generated-subheading1|title=Entry requirements|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315090824/http://www2.lse.ac.uk/graduateProspectus2010/entryRequirements/Home.aspx#generated-subheading1|archive-date=15 March 2010|publisher=LSE|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the department of English Language and Literature at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] considers a GPA of "about 3.8" equivalent to a first class degree.&lt;ref name="Oxford English Language and Literature entrance requirement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/postgraduate_courses/course_guide/english_language_.html|title=English Language &amp; Literature|publisher=University of Oxford|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113014632/http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/postgraduate_courses/course_guide/english_language_.html|archive-date=13 November 2010|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the UK NARIC gives equivalent GPAs for determining eligibility for teacher training bursaries.&lt;ref name="gov.uk"/&gt; In contrast,  [[Durham University]]'s ''North American Undergraduate Guide 2017'' gives a conversion table as a guide to understanding British classifications (rather than for admission to postgraduate study) of 1st = 3.8–4.0, 2:1 = 3.3–3.7, 2:2 = 2.8–3.2 and  3rd = 2.3–2.7.&lt;ref name="Durham GPA"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://issuu.com/communicationsoffice/docs/4230-duio_ug_north_america_brochure|title=North American Undergraduate Guide|publisher=Durham University|date=20 August 2017|website=ISSUU|accessdate=3 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506164715/https://issuu.com/communicationsoffice/docs/4230-duio_ug_north_america_brochure|archivedate=6 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Academic grading in Canada|Canadian academic grades]] may be given as letters, percentages, 12-point GPAs or 4-point GPAs. The 4-point GPAs are sometimes seen to differ from the US but other sources treat them as equivalent. The Durham conversion specifies GPAs for the US and letter grades/percentages for Canada&lt;ref name="Durham GPA"/&gt; while the UK NARIC has separate GPA conversions for the four-year bachelor's honours, baccalauréat and professional bachelor's degrees (which differ from their US GPA equivalents by at most 0.1) and the three-year bachelor's degree (which is seen as a lower standard).&lt;ref name="gov.uk"/&gt;  The ''British Graduate Admissions Fact Sheet'' from [[McGill University]] uses the conversion 1st = 4.0; 2:1 = 3.0; 2:2 = 2.7; 3rd = 2.0; Pass = 1.0; Fail = 0.0.&lt;ref name="McGill equiv"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secureweb.mcgill.ca/gradapplicants/sites/mcgill.ca.gradapplicants/files/UNITED_KINGDOM.pdf|title=Future graduate students: European Fact Sheets – UK|publisher=McGill University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403132112/https://secureweb.mcgill.ca/gradapplicants/sites/mcgill.ca.gradapplicants/files/UNITED_KINGDOM.pdf|archive-date=3 April 2015|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Degrees in the UK are mapped to levels of the [[Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies]] (FHEQ), which includes the Framework for Qualifications of Higher Education Institutes in Scotland (FQHEIS), which has an alternative numbering of levels corresponding to those of the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF). Bachelor's degrees (including the [[Scottish MA]], but not including [[MB BS|medical degrees]], dentistry degrees or degrees in veterinary science) attained in the UK are at FHEQ level 6/FQHEIS level 9 (ordinary) or 10 (honours); master's degrees (including integrated master's degrees and first degrees in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science) are at FHEQ level 7/FQHEIS level 11, and doctoral degrees are at FHEQ level 8/FQHEIS level 12. Bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees map to first, second and third cycle qualifications in the [[Bologna Process#Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area|Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scqf.org.uk/framework-diagram/Framework.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140616065231/http://scqf.org.uk/framework-diagram/Framework.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-06-16|title=The Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/qualifications-frameworks.pdf|title=The Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies|publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education]]|date=November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305083730/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/qualifications-frameworks.pdf|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progression to postgraduate study==
Regulations governing the progression of undergraduate degree graduates to postgraduate programmes vary among universities, and are often flexible.  A candidate for a postgraduate master's degree is usually required to have at least a 2:2 bachelor honours degree, although candidates with 2:1s are in a considerably stronger position to gain a place in a postgraduate course and to obtain funding, especially in medical and natural sciences.  Some institutions specify a 2:1 minimum for certain types of master's program, such as for a [[Master of Research]] course.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/gsprospectus/applying/entry.html Entrance requirements: Graduate Prospectus 2010–11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913073724/http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/gsprospectus/applying/entry.html |date=13 September 2008 }}, ''[[University of Cambridge]]'', September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://lfylive.lse.ac.uk/lfy/tc/enquiries/enquiry.html?a=4&amp;q=565 What are the entry requirements for graduate programmes at LSE?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009014628/https://lfylive.lse.ac.uk/lfy/tc/enquiries/enquiry.html?a=4&amp;q=565 |date=9 October 2011 }}, ''[[London School of Economics]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidates with a Third or an Ordinary degree are sometimes accepted, provided they have acquired satisfactory professional experience subsequent to graduation.  A candidate for a doctoral programme who does not hold a master's degree is nearly always required to have a First or 2:1 at bachelor's level.

==Variations==

===International degrees===

====Australia====
Some universities, such as those in Australia, offer ordinary or pass degrees, (for instance, as a three-year B.A. or a three-year BSc) by default.  High-achieving students may be recognised with an honours classification without further coursework or research, as is often the case in engineering, which often contains a research and thesis component,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2012/B-ENG|title=BEng (Bachelor of Engineering)|work=University of Melbourne Handbook|publisher=University of Melbourne|accessdate=31 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722101206/https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2012/B-ENG|archivedate=22 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.unsw.edu.au/info-about/our-faculty/faculty-policies/honours-policy|title=Honours Policy|publisher=Faculty of Engineering, University of New South Wales|accessdate=31 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702165314/http://www.eng.unsw.edu.au/info-about/our-faculty/faculty-policies/honours-policy|archivedate=2 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; or law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/current-students/my-academic-life/honours|title=Honours|publisher=UNSW Faculty of Law|accessdate=31 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516014028/http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/current-students/my-academic-life/honours|archivedate=16 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other courses (such as humanities, arts, social sciences, and sciences) and other universities may recognise high-achieving students with an honours classification with further coursework or research, undertaken either concurrently with, and as part of or in addition to, a bachelor's course,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/law/cstudent/undergrad/honours_program.shtml|title="New" Honours Program|publisher=Sydney Law School|accessdate=31 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130716063911/http://sydney.edu.au/law/cstudent/undergrad/honours_program.shtml|archivedate=16 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; or after completion of a bachelor's course requirements and attaining adequately competitive grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/currentstudents/honours-mathematics-and-statistics|title=The Honours Year|publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of New South Wales|accessdate=31 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813034354/http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/currentstudents/honours-mathematics-and-statistics|archivedate=13 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asb.unsw.edu.au/schools/economics/programsandcourses/honours/Pages/default.aspx|title=Honours – Programs &amp; courses – Economics|publisher=Australian School of Business, University of New South Wales|accessdate=31 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003205335/http://www.asb.unsw.edu.au/schools/economics/programsandcourses/honours/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=3 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To comply with this standard, some institutions have commenced, or will commence, offering high-achieving graduates with "distinction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/sites/law.unsw.edu.au/files/images/jd_honours_policy_from_2015.pdf|title=Law JD Honours as of 2015|publisher=UNSW Faculty of Law|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403133957/http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/sites/law.unsw.edu.au/files/images/jd_honours_policy_from_2015.pdf|archivedate=3 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, this is consistent with British graduate degree classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar/academicregulations/taughtmastersdegreesfourunits.htm|title=Taught Masters Degree|publisher=London School of Economics|accessdate=31 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719070843/http://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar/academicregulations/taughtmastersdegreesfourunits.htm|archivedate=19 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British medical and dental degrees===
In the United Kingdom, medicine is usually taught as an undergraduate course, with graduates being awarded a master's level qualification: normally the conjoined degrees of [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]] (MBBS, BM BCh, MB ChB, etc.) although at [[Queen's University Belfast]] (and universities in Ireland) Bachelor in the Art of Obstetrics (BAO) is added, and at some universities only the [[Bachelor of Medicine]] is awarded - all of these have equal standing. Unlike most undergraduate degrees, the MBBS is not normally considered an honours degree, and thus is not classified into first class honours, etc. Students may be awarded "Merits" and "Distinctions" for parts of the course or the whole course (depending on the institution) and "Honours" may be awarded at some institutions for exceptional performance throughout the course (as a grade above Distinction).&lt;ref name="QAA medicine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/Subject-benchmark-statement-Medicine.pdf|title=Subject benchmark statement - Medicine|publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency]]|accessdate=23 February 2017|date=2002|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122221116/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/Subject-benchmark-statement-Medicine.pdf|archivedate=22 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/regulations/programme/2016-2017/documents/A101A1001500UProgrammeRegulations.pdf|title=MBBS Programme Regulations 2016/17|publisher=[[Newcastle University]]|accessdate=23 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223125936/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/regulations/programme/2016-2017/documents/A101A1001500UProgrammeRegulations.pdf|archivedate=23 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical schools split their year groups into one of 10 [[decile]]s.  These deciles are the major factor in the calculation of Educational Performance Measure (EPM) points used as part of medical students' [[Foundation Programme]] applications, with the top decile receiving 43 points, decreasing by a point for each decile (so the lowest gets 34 points); 7 points can be awarded for other educational achievements (other degrees and publications), and the EPM points are combined with up to 50 points from the Situational Judgement Test to give a total out of 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foundationprogramme.nhs.uk/pages/fp-afp/faqs/EPM|title=EPM FAQs|publisher=[[National Health Service]]|accessdate=23 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223130240/http://www.foundationprogramme.nhs.uk/pages/fp-afp/faqs/EPM|archivedate=23 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foundationprogramme.nhs.uk/download.asp?file=FP_AFP_Applicants_Handbook_2017.pdf|title=FP/AFP 2017 Applicant's Handbook|publisher=[[National Health Service]]|accessdate=23 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223212536/http://www.foundationprogramme.nhs.uk/download.asp?file=FP_AFP_Applicants_Handbook_2017.pdf|archivedate=23 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==British Grade Point Average==
Following the recommendation of the Burgess report into the honours degree classification system in 2007, the [[Higher Education Academy]] ran a pilot in 2013–2014 in collaboration with 21 institutions delivering higher education (ranging from [[Russell Group]] universities to [[Further Education]] colleges) to investigate how a Grade Point Average (GPA) system would work best in Britain. Two main weighting systems were tested: an American-style average of all marks, weighted only by credit value, and weighting by "exit velocity" in the manner of the honours classification, where modules in the first year are given a low or zero weight and modules in the final year have a higher weight (a third model was only rarely used). Over two thirds of providers preferred exit-velocity weighting to the straight average.&lt;ref name="GPA report"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/resource/grade-point-average-report-gpa-pilot-project-2013-14|title=Grade point average: Report of the GPA pilot project 2013-14|date=28 May 2015|publisher=Higher Education Academy|accessdate=23 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224134517/https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/resource/grade-point-average-report-gpa-pilot-project-2013-14|archivedate=24 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A GPA scale, tied to percentage marks and letter grades, was recommended for use nationally following the study, to run in parallel with the honours degree classification system.&lt;ref name="GPA report"/&gt;

'''Cab Gallery''' was an art project from 1999 to 2001 [[curator|curated]] by London art dealer Paul Stolper of [[Paul Stolper Gallery]] and art collector and London taxi driver Jason Brown. The concept was for art to be exhibited on the outside and inside of a working [[London Taxi|London taxi]] rather than a traditional [[art gallery|gallery]] space. As stated by Brown, "It was important to me that when working, the artwork was incidental to the journey of the passenger. I hoped they would notice but it was part of their environment and unexpected. It was also interesting to me to learn which artworks they reacted to. But it had to be a natural discovery."

Artists were provided the views and dimensions of the available spaces such as the bottom of [[Folding seat|fold-up seats]] (or "tip-up seats"), the exterior of the cab, and limited inside options for free-standing work. Because the cab was also a working London taxi, after each artwork was selected by the curators, approval from the Cab Advertising Committee of the [[Public Carriage Office]] was also required. Artwork placed on the exterior of the cab was printed in vinyl the same as per usual advertising procedures. Special receipts were designed, listing participating artists and contact details. In addition to serving as gallery space during working cab hours, Cab Gallery would park outside galleries on their opening nights enabling the artists to exhibit more ambitious and experimental installation and sound pieces.

Throughout the project Brown honored his commitment to the project's concept of never bringing attention to the art while operating as a working cab but rather allowing the passengers to discover it for themselves. When the cab was serving as a stationary exhibition space at art galleries and events, however, Brown would often act as de facto [[museum docent|docent]] for the collection.

==History==
In 1999, Brown approached Stolper with the idea of exhibiting art in the spaces reserved for advertising in his traditional London Black Taxi, and Cab Gallery was launched in [[Hoxton Square]] on 24 September 1999.

The first exterior was a text piece by [[Bob and Roberta Smith]], ''Taxy'' in red and yellow vinyl. On the fold-up seats were two text pieces by [[Peter Liversidge]], who became a regular contributor to the project and whose collected proposals were later published in book form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ISBN= 978-1870540322|last1 = Liversidge|first1 = Peter|title = Proposals for Paul E. Stolper and Jason Brown: For: Cab Gallery, Reg: S310 DGJ, Model: Tx : 1|year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on display at the launch were ''All the animals'', an embroidered cushion by [[Abigail Cohen]], ''from Swiss Cottage to Soho and back,'' a book of drawings by [[Susie Hamilton]], and ''Cab Gallery Greeting'', a sound piece by [[Jessica Voorsanger]]. Absinthe was served out of the rear boot of the taxi.

The success of the launch led to other artists becoming involved and invitations by galleries and art event organizers to participate in their openings. On these occasions, the Cab was parked outside the entrance and artists had the opportunity to create more ambitious artworks as installations and sound pieces.

In mid-2000, the Bob and Roberta Smith exterior artwork was replaced with ''Sunny'' by [[Alex Katz]], the American figurative painter.
The popularity of the project spread through wide media coverage and Cab Gallery participated in its first show outside London at the [[Ikon Gallery]] in Birmingham. This was soon followed by [[From Space Gallery]] in Manchester and in 2001 the [[Aspex Gallery]] in Portsmouth.
In 2001 the final exterior of the cab became ''Out from Under'' by important American [[conceptual art]]ist [[Lawrence Weiner]].
The project expanded to include a website featuring a project by [[Layla Curtis]] which traced the routes made by Brown in his cab over a specific week.

The project came to feature regular new pieces by Peter Liversidge, the "house artist," as well as new artists and artwork to keep the project fresh.
By the end of 2001 after media coverage as wide ranging as the magazines Top Gear, The Art News and Art in America and daily papers from Finland to Australia it was felt that the project should end at its height.

==Retrospective==
[[File:Retrospective with Lawrence Weiner Cab Exterior.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Retrospective with cab exterior ''Out from Under'' by Lawrence Weiner]]
The curators arranged for a retrospective exhibition immediately upon discontinuing the project, held as part of the opening of the [[Essor Gallery]], which occupied the main gallery as well as a project space nearby. The Cab Gallery Retrospective ran from 15–22 January 2002 and included the "Cab Gallery" itself, which was parked up inside. All previous artworks were on show along with films and sound pieces.

Paul Stolper continues as a leading London gallery owner and publisher.

Jason Brown collaborated with Chelsea space at [[Chelsea College of Art &amp; Design]] to use the same taxi, renamed the Chelsea Cab, to exhibit new exterior artwork on the cab by [[Bruce McLean]], [[Stephen Farthing|Stephen Farthing RA]] and [[David Shrigley]]. In 2012 he moved to Nashville, Tennessee and continues to curate art shows including exchanges between London and Nashville. In 2012 Brown donated the entire Cab Gallery archive including artwork, correspondence and ephemera to the Special Collections at the Library at the Chelsea College of Art &amp; Design.&lt;ref&gt;For a description of the materials available, see http://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/library-services/collections-and-archives/chelsea/#CAB_Gallery_Archive.

A '''de Finetti diagram''' is a [[ternary plot]] used in [[population genetics]]. It is named after the [[Italy|Italian]] [[statistics|statistician]] [[Bruno de Finetti]] (1906–1985) and is used to graph the [[genotype frequency|genotype frequencies]] of [[population]]s, where there are two [[allele]]s and the population is [[diploidy|diploid]]. It is based on an [[equilateral triangle]], and [[Viviani's theorem]] concerning any point within the triangle, and the three lines from that point that are perpendicular to the sides of the triangle. The sum of the lengths of the lines is a fixed value, regardless of the position of the point. This value (the sum of the lengths) is set to be 1.

==Applications in genetics==

The de Finetti diagram has been put to extensive use in population genetics by [[A.W.F. Edwards]] in his book ''Foundations of Mathematical Genetics''.  In its simplest form the diagram can be used to show the range of genotype frequencies for which [[Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium]] is satisfied (the curve within the diagram).  [[A.W.F. Edwards]] and [[Chris Cannings]] extended its use to demonstrate the changes that occur in allele frequencies under [[natural selection]].

[[Image:Desertisland.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A desert island in [[Palau]]]]A '''deserted island''' or '''uninhabited island''' is an [[island]] that is not permanently populated by [[human]]s. Uninhabited islands are often used in movies or stories about [[shipwreck]]ed people, and are also used as stereotypes for the idea of "[[paradise]]". Some uninhabited islands are protected as [[nature reserve]]s and some are privately owned. [[Devon Island]] in [[Canada]] is claimed to be the largest uninhabited island in the world.

Small coral [[atolls]] or islands usually have no source of [[fresh water]], but at times a fresh water [[lens (hydrology)|lens]] ([[Ghyben–Herzberg lens]]) can be reached with a well.

==Terminology==
[[Image:LakshadweepIsland.jpg|thumb|One of the uninhabited islands in [[Lakshadweep]], India]]
Uninhabited islands are sometimes also called "deserted islands" or "desert islands". In the latter, the adjective "[[wikt:desert#Adjective|desert]]" connotes not [[desert]] climate conditions, but rather "desolate and sparsely occupied or unoccupied".  The word "desert" has been "formerly applied more widely to any wild, uninhabited region, including forest-land", and it is this archaic meaning that appears in the phrase "desert island".&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;"desert, n.2". Oxford English Dictionary Online. June 2016. Oxford University Press. http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/50774?redirectedFrom=desert+island (accessed June 14, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the term "deserted island" does not imply that the island was previously inhabited and later deserted.{{Citation needed|reason=claim is opinion|date=October 2018}}

The term "desert island" is also commonly used figuratively to refer to objects or behavior in conditions of social isolation and limited material means. Behavior on a desert island is a common [[thought experiment]], for example, "desert island morality".&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt;

==In literature and popular culture==
The first known [[novel]]s to be set on a desert island were ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan|Philosophus Autodidactus]]'' written by [[Ibn Tufail]] (1105–1185), followed by ''[[Ibn al-Nafis#Theologus Autodidactus|Theologus Autodidactus]]'' written by [[Ibn al-Nafis]] (1213–1288). The [[protagonist]]s in both (Hayy in ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' and Kamil in ''Theologus Autodidactus'') are [[feral child]]ren living in seclusion on a deserted island, until they eventually come in contact with [[castaway]]s from the outside world who are stranded on the island. The story of ''Theologus Autodidactus'', however, extends beyond the deserted island setting when the castaways take Kamil back to [[civilization]] with them.&lt;ref name=Roubi&gt;Dr. Abu Shadi Al-Roubi (1982), "Ibn Al-Nafis as a philosopher", ''Symposium on Ibn al-Nafis'', Second International Conference on Islamic Medicine: Islamic Medical Organization, Kuwait ([[cf.]] [http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html Ibnul-Nafees As a Philosopher] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206072116/http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html |date=February 6, 2008 }}, ''Encyclopedia of Islamic World'').&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Shakespeare]]'s 1610–11 play, ''[[The Tempest]]'', uses the idea of being stranded on a desert island as a pretext for the action of the play. [[Prospero]] and his daughter [[Miranda (The Tempest)|Miranda]] are set adrift by Prospero's treacherous brother Antonio, seeking to become [[Duke of Milan]], and Prospero in turn shipwrecks his brother and other men of sin onto the island.

A [[Latin]] translation of Ibn Tufail's ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' appeared in 1671, prepared by [[Edward Pococke]] the Younger,&lt;ref name=Amber&gt;Amber Haque (2004), "Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists", ''Journal of Religion and Health'' '''43''' (4): 357–377 [369].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2011}} followed by an [[English language|English]] translation by [[Simon Ockley]] in 1708,&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Ockley]] (1708), ''The Improvement of Human Reason: Exhibited in the Life of Hai Ebn Yokdhan'', [[Oxford University]].&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] translations.&lt;ref name=Wainwright&gt;Martin Wainwright, [http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,918454,00.html Desert island scripts], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 22 March 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 17th century, ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' inspired [[Robert Boyle]], an acquaintance of Pococke, to write his own philosophical novel set on a deserted island, ''The Aspiring Naturalist''.&lt;ref name=Toomer&gt;[[G. J. Toomer]] (1996), ''Eastern Wisedome and Learning: The Study of Arabic in Seventeenth-Century England'', p. 222, [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-820291-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn al-Nafis' ''Theologus Autodidactus'' was also eventually translated into English in the early 20th century.
[[File:Robinson Offterdinger 001.jpg|thumb|upright|Robinson Crusoe in an 1887 German illustration]]
Published in 1719, [[Daniel Defoe]]'s novel ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' about a castaway on a desert island has spawned so many imitations in film, television and radio that its name was used to define a genre, [[Robinsonade]].&lt;ref&gt;''Steampunk'' anthology, 2008, ed. [[Ann VanderMeer]] &amp; [[Jeff VanderMeer]], {{ISBN|978-1-892391-75-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Empire Islands: Castaways, Cannibals, And Fantasies of Conquest'', by Rebecca Weaver-Hightower, University of Minnesota P, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0816648634}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel features [[Friday (Robinson Crusoe)|Man Friday]], Crusoe's personal assistant. It is likely that Defoe took inspiration for Crusoe from a [[Scotland|Scottish]] sailor named [[Alexander Selkirk]], who was rescued in 1709 after four years on the otherwise uninhabited [[Juan Fernández Islands]]; Defoe usually made use of current events for his plots. It is also likely that he was inspired by the Latin or English translations of Ibn Tufail's ''Philosophus Autodidactus''.&lt;ref name=Amber/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wainwright/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nawal Muhammad Hassan (1980), ''Hayy bin Yaqzan and Robinson Crusoe: A study of an early Arabic impact on English literature'', Al-Rashid House for Publication.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Glasse (2001), ''New [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]'', p. 202, Rowman Altamira, {{ISBN|0-7591-0190-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom Neale]] was a New Zealander who voluntarily spent 16 years in three sessions in the 1950s and 1960s living alone on the island of [[Suwarrow]] in the northern [[Cook Islands]] group.  His time there is documented in his autobiography, ''An Island To Oneself''. Significant novels set on deserted islands include ''[[The Swiss Family Robinson]]'', ''[[The Coral Island]]'', ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'', ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'', ''[[The Cay (novel)|The Cay]]'' and ''[[The Beach (novel)|The Beach]]''. [[Juana Maria]], a Native American woman, was stranded for 18 years on [[San Nicolas Island]] off California in the 19th century.

The theme of being stranded on a desert island has inspired films, such as ''[[Cast Away]]'', and TV series, like ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' and the comedy ''[[Gilligan's Island]]''. It is also the driving force behind [[reality show]]s like ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]'' and the [[Discovery Kids]] show ''[[Flight 29 Down]]''.

In the popular conception, such islands are often located in the [[Pacific]], [[tropical]], uninhabited and usually uncharted. {{Citation needed|reason=Whose popular conception?|date=July 2014}}  They are remote locales that offer escape and force people marooned or stranded as [[castaway]]s to become self-sufficient and essentially create a new society. This society can either be [[utopian]], based on an ingenious re-creation of society's comforts (as in ''[[Swiss Family Robinson]]'' and, in a humorous form, ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'') or a regression into savagery (the major theme of both ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'' and ''[[The Beach (novel)|The Beach]]'').  In reality, small coral [[atolls]] or islands usually have no source of [[fresh water]] (thus precluding any long-term human survival), but at times a [[fresh water]] lens ([[Ghyben–Herzberg lens]]) can be reached with a well.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

During the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apocalyptic war]] depicted in [[H.G. Wells]]'s ''[[The War in the Air]]'', [[Goat Island (New York)|Goat Island]] in the middle of the [[Niagara Falls]] becomes abruptly a desert island when all bridges linking it to the mainland are destroyed - marooning a few survivors who embark on a bitter struggle for survival.

The [[BBC]] Radio 4 program ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' asks well-known people what items they would take with them to a deserted island. The program has inspired many similar articles, contests, and projects, including "desert island books," "desert island movies," and so on.

Some songs mention about desert islands, including one sung by [[Noel Paul Stookey]] from [[Peter, Paul and Mary]].

Desert islands are also a hugely popular image for [[gag cartoon]]s, the island being conventionally depicted as just a few yards across with a single palm tree (probably due to the visual constraints of the medium). 17 such cartoons appeared in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in 1957 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/05/history-of-the-desert-island-cartoon |title=A Guy, a Palm Tree, and a Desert Island: The Cartoon Genre That Just Won’t Die |author=Bruce Handy |date=May 25, 2012 |work=Vanity Fair |accessdate=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[message in a bottle]] is a form of communication often associated with people stranded on a deserted island attempting to be rescued.

Another story has to do with a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] seaman who was left alone on the island of [[Saint Helena]] as punishment. He fell into such despair that he disinterred the body of a buried comrade and set out to sea in the coffin. Another castaway, the Spaniard [[Pedro Serrano (sailor)|Pedro Serrano]], was rescued after seven and a half years of solitude.

In 1820, the crew of the [[whaler]] [[Essex (1799 whaleship)|''Essex'']] spent time on uninhabited [[Henderson Island (Pitcairn Islands)|Henderson Island]]. There they gorged on birds, fish, and vegetation and found a small freshwater spring. After one week, they had depleted the island's resources and most of the crew left on three [[whaleboat]]s, while three of the men decided to remain on the island and survived there for four months until their rescue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015006574233;view=1up;seq=293|title=Lloyd's list.  1821.|website=HathiTrust|language=en|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deterritorialization''' ({{lang-fr|déterritorialisation}}) is a [[concept]] created by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] in ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972). The term "deterritorialization" first occurs in French [[psychoanalytic]] theory to refer, broadly, to the fluid, dissipated and schizophrenic nature of human subjectivity in contemporary capitalist cultures ([[Deleuze]] &amp; [[Guattari]] 1972).

Its most common use, however, has been in relation to the process of [[cultural globalization]]. Though there are different inflections involved, the general implication that [[globalization]] needs to be understood in cultural-spatial terms as much as in institutional or political-economic ones is common to all accounts&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307 &lt;/ref&gt;. In this broad sense, deterritorialization has affinities with the idea of the "disembedding" of social relations in, for example, [[Anthony Giddens]]'s (1990) analysis of the globalizing properties of [[modernity]].

==Overview==
''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980) distinguishes between  [[wikt:relative|relative]] and an [[wikt:absolute|absolute]] deterritorialization. Relative deterritorialization is always accompanied by reterritorialization, while positive absolute deterritorialization is more akin to the construction of a "[[plane of immanence]]", akin to [[Spinoza]]'s [[ontological]] constitution of the world.{{Ref|Negri}} There is also a negative sort of absolute deterritorialization, for example in the [[subjectivation]] process (''the face''). 

The function of deterritorialization is defined as "the movement by which one leaves a territory", also known as a "line of flight"&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307&lt;/ref&gt;. Still, deterritorialization "constitutes and extends" the territory itself&lt;ref&gt;Papastergiadis, N., 2018. The turbulence of migration: Globalization, deterritorialization and hybridity. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==In anthropology==
When referring to culture, anthropologists use the term '''deterritorialized''' to refer to a weakening of ties between culture and place. This means the removal of cultural subjects and objects from a certain location in space and time.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example,{{cite book|last1=Roy|first1=Olivier|title=Holy Ignorance:  When Religion and Culture Part Ways|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-932802-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It implies that certain cultural aspects tend to transcend specific territorial boundaries in a world that consists of things fundamentally in motion.

==In the context of cultural globalization==
In the context of [[cultural globalization]], some{{Weasel inline|date=September 2016}} argue deterritorialization is a cultural feature developed by the "[[mediatization]], migration, and [[commodification]] which characterize globalized [[modernity]]". This implies that by people working towards closer involvement with the whole of the world, and works towards lessening the gap with one another, one may be widening the gap with what is physically close to them.

According to the works of [[Arjun Appadurai]], this cultural distancing from the locality, is intensified when people are able to expand and alter their imagination through the mediatization of alien cultural conditions, making this culture of remote origin one of a familiar material. This makes it difficult for a local entity to sustain and retain its own local cultural identity, which also affects the national identity of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez, G. M. (2002). ''The deterritorialization of cultural heritage'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Appadurai, Arjun. (1990). ''Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy''.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Appadurai's 1990 essay "Disjuncture and Difference": "Deterritorialization, in general, is one of the central forces of the modern world because it brings laboring populations in to the lower-class sectors and spaces of relatively wealthy societies, while sometimes creating exaggerated and intensified senses of criticism or attachment to politics in the home state. Deterritorialization, whether of Hindus, Sikhs, Palestinians, or Ukrainians, is now at the core of a variety of global [[fundamentalism]]s, including [[Islamic]] and [[Hindu]] fundamentalism. In the Hindu case, for example, it is clear that the overseas movement of Indians has been exploited by a variety of interests both within and outside India to create a complicated network of finances and religious identifications, by which the problem of cultural reproduction for Hindus abroad has become tied to the politics of Hindu fundamentalism at home.

At the same time, deterritorialization creates new markets for film companies, art impressions, and travel agencies, which thrive on the end of the deterritorialized population for contact with its homeland. Naturally, these invented homelands, which constitute the [[mediascape]]s of deterritorialized groups, can often become sufficiently fantastic and one-sided that they provide the material for new ideoscapes in which ethnic conflicts can begin to erupt."  (Appadurai 1990:11–12)

===Deterritorialization and reterritorialization===
Deterritorialization and [[reterritorialization]] exist simultaneously. In [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]]'s follow-up to [[Anti-Oedipus]], [[A Thousand Plateaus]], they distinguish between relative deterritorialization, which is always accompanied by reterritorialization, and absolute deterritorialization, which gives rise to a plane of immanence. In both forms of deterritorialization, however, the idea of physical territory remains just that, an idea and reference point.

Mediatization works as a preferential source of deterritorialization, while it becomes a catalyser of other sources of deterritorialization (migrations, tourism, vast shopping centres, and economical transformations). As [[Tomlinson]] points out,&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson, J. (1999): Globalization and Culture, Chicago. University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; mediatization is absolutely omnipresent in everyday contemporary cultural experiences, it therefore appears as clearly decisive in deterritorialized cultural experience. The aforementioned experience implies opening up to the world and amplifying cultural horizons through the globalized mass media. This means that globalization transforms the relation between the places where we live and our cultural activities, experiences and identities. Paradoxically, deterritorialization also includes reterritorialized manifestations, which García Canclini defines as "certain relative, partial territorial relocalizations of old and new symbolic productions".&lt;ref&gt;García Canclini, N. (1990): Culturas híbridas: estrategias para entrar y salir de la modernidad, Mexico. Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes/Grijalbo.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the concept of glocalization proposed by Robertson, deterritorialization and reterritorialization constitute both sides of the same coin of cultural globalization.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, R. (1992): Globalization: Social Theory and Global Culture, London. Sage. – (2000): "Globalización: tiempo-espacio y homogeneidad-heterogeneidad", Zona Abierta, 92/93, pp. 213-241.&lt;/ref&gt; Deterritorialization speaks of the loss of the "natural" relation between culture and the social and geographic territories, and describes a deep transformation of the link between our everyday cultural experiences and our configuration as preferably local beings. As [[Giddens]] argues, "the very tissue of spatial experience alters, conjoining proximity and distance in ways that have few close parallels in prior ages". Nevertheless, it is very important not to interpret the deterritorialization of localized cultural experiences as an impoverishment of cultural interaction, but as a transformation produced by the impact the growing cultural transnational connections have on the local realm, which means that deterritorialization generates a [[relativization]] and a transformation of local cultural experiences, whether it is from the local event itself or by the projection of symbolical shapes from the local event.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, A. (1990) The Consequences of Modernity, Cambridge. Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Displacement===
Although the process of across-boundaries flow was imbalanced, it cannot be denied that it has profound influence on politics, economics, and culture from every dimension. Although there were imbalanced power presences in different nations, it is undeniable that people will gradually realize that in addition to their own lives around are mutually implicated in the distant shore, but also to reconcile the impact between their lives around and the distant side. That is, the flow process of beyond the boundaries not only the representatives of strengthening interdependence, but also representatives that they both have the cognitive of [[globalization]]. It formed an easily comprehensive characteristics about "superterritorial" and "transworld". In other words, the original divide in the territorial boundaries between them have lost some authority, what is the main phenomenon of deterritorialization.&lt;ref&gt;Scholte, Jan Aart. 2005. Globalization: A Critical Introduction. Basingstoke/New York: Palgrave Macmillan. pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, no matter from what angle to explore globalization, deterritorialization has been a general consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Larner, Wendy and William Walters. 2004. "Globalization as Governmentality," Alternatives. Vol.29, pp. 495-517.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "deterritorialization" may have different meanings. [[Tomlinson]] had pointed out that many scholars use the vocabulary of deterritorialization to explain the process of globalization, however, there are still some scholars who prefer the use of related words, such as "[[delocalization]]" or "[[Forced migration|displacement]]".&lt;ref&gt;John Tomlinson. 1999. Globalization and Culture. pp. 119-121&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasized different point in the use of different terms, but basically we can understand the meaning of these words that is to understand the transformation between local and cultures of the global modernity. In the text of Tomlinson, however, we found that he uses "deterritorialization" to explain the phenomenon instead of using "delocalization". But we can unearth that "deterritorialization" was more focused on liberating the people from the "local", is a process which no longer just only affected by neighborhood and familiar local, but also deeply influenced by the distant place.

As sociologist [[Anthony Giddens]] indicated, the most immediate experience of global modernity, in fact, is we stay in our own familiar environment but feel the feeling of living in different places because of globalization. Say in other words, the local has hardly affected by the distance place, however, under the impact of globalization, distant events made its influence reach into your daily life in the environment, which is the concept of "displacement". Due to the space experiences which were combined with neighboring and distant in people's daily life, it can be said that globalization has fundamentally changed our concept of the space.

===Disjunctive relationships===
However, communication technology may act not only to fill the field of local cultural significance and identity which corroded by deterritorialization, but also to establish global cultural politics. Politics of deterritorialization and the displacement of [[sociological]] will lead the struggle between state and nation.  One important new feature of global cultural politics, tied to the [[disjunctive population|disjunctive]] relationships among the various landscapes which proposed by Appadurai, is that state and nation are at each other's throats, and the hyphen that links them is now less an icon of conjuncture than an index of disjuncture.

The '''''End All Be All''''' game system, commonly known as '''''EABA''''' and pronounced "ee-buh", is a [[role-playing game system]] from [[Blacksburg Tactical Research Center]] (BTRC).  It is a generic gaming systems designed to adapt to any [[Fictional universe|imaginary gaming environment]].&lt;ref name="GR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamingreport.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Reviews&amp;file=index&amp;req=showcontent&amp;id=1960| title=EABA Role Playing Game System v1.1 (Review)|last=McClung| first=Ron|publisher=GamingReport.com|date=January 2006| accessdate=2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created by [[Greg Porter (game designer)|Greg Porter]] in [[2003 in games|2003]].  The game cites the ''[[Hero System]]'', ''[[GURPS]]'' and ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'' as influences in its development.&lt;ref name="GR"/&gt;

The game books and related materials are available only in a [[PDF]] format download, or printed [[Print on demand|on demand]].

== History ==
=== Prior RPG History ===
[[Role-playing game]]s (RPGs) of the 1970s and early 1980s were environment specific, and incompatible with one another. For example, [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] published its ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' game specifically for a [[fantasy]] environment. Another game from the same company, ''[[Star Frontiers]]'', was developed for [[science fiction]]-based role-playing. TSR produced other games for other environments, such as ''[[Gamma World]]'', ''[[Top Secret (game)|Top Secret]]'', ''[[Gangbusters]]'', ''[[Boot Hill (role-playing game)|Boot Hill]]'', and more. Each of these games was set with its own self-contained [[Role-playing game system|rules system]], and the rules for playing each game differed greatly from one game to the next.

This changed with the publication of ''[[GURPS]]'', or ''Generic Universal Role Playing System'', by [[Steve Jackson Games]] in 1986, the first commercially successful, all-encompassing, [[Generic role-playing game system|"universal" role-playing system]].

In 1987, BTRC published its first role-playing game, ''[[Timelords (role-playing game)|TimeLords]]'', in which players played characters based upon themselves in a [[time travel]] setting.  As a time travel/sci fi-based game crossing many possible settings, much of the groundwork was already laid for a universal RPG, and in fact some players were already using it as a generic game system. Much of the basics of the ''TimeLords'' system would later be converted into ''EABA''.

=== ''EABA 1st Edition'' ===
EABA was first published in 2003 as a PDF only, available either through online download or print on demand. Publishing in this manner meant the company would not go into debt to print a large run of rulebooks and push them into brick-and-mortar stores, and that future updates to the rules could be easily made and disseminated.  BTRC allows purchasers to get free upgrades for life on all titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gamingballistic.com/tag/eaba/|title=EABA – Gaming Ballistic|website=gamingballistic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''EABA v2'' ===
In 2012, BTRC published its first major revamp of the EABA rules as ''EABA v2''.  In addition to significant revamping of the combat turn system, this version made use of many of the built-in features of the Adobe PDF format, and was streamlined for use on tablet or latptop computers. Players have access to automated character sheets, dice rollers, popup menus and on-screen mapping, embedded directly into the PDF file. It is compatible with any computer or device that can read this file type, including smart phones and tablets. The file can also be printed and read like any ordinary rulebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rpggeek.com/thread/982328/eaba-v2-hopefully-not-too-biased-review|title=EABA V2. A hopefully not too biased review. -|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rpggeek.com/thread/1057900/eaba-v201-add-review|title=EABA v2.01, an add on review. -|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

EABA initially received excellent reviews, and was described as "an overlooked and underappreciated Titan in the arena of universal RPG systems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/13/13297.phtml|title=Review of EABA - RPGnet  RPG Game Index|website=www.rpg.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics praised the simplicity and ease of use, and the ability for players to choose what level of realism to include. Initial criticism focused on the lack of many additional premade settings and the bland artwork. It did not sell incredibly well, and is relatively unknown among RPG fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geeknative.com/663/eaba/|title=EABA|date=21 August 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The v2 edition also received excellent reviews, calling it "the bleeding edge of PDF game development", and praising the scalability and portability of the system.

== Game Mechanics ==
===Characters===
A character in ''EABA'' is built based on attributes, skills and traits.&lt;ref name="GR" /&gt; All player characters start with a set number of Attribute Points (AP) to purchase attributes, and Skill Points (SP) to purchase skills.  Traits are purchased using either type of points, depending on the trait purchased; negative traits can also be chosen which give a character additional AP or SP to spend.

The total number of points available to spend depends on the setting and players.  A gritty post-holocaust survival game may only start with 80 AP and SP, while a superhero game could start with 400 AP and SP. In principle a [[gamemaster]] can balance the power of foes to the abilities of the player characters by comparing their relative point values.

===Attributes===
Characters in ''EABA'' have six '''basic [[attribute (role-playing games)|attribute]]s''':&lt;ref name="GR" /&gt;

*'''Strength''' — A measure of the character’s ''physical'' power and bulk, ability to lift, carry, and do damage
*'''Agility''' — A measure of the character’s ''physical'' agility, coordination and manual dexterity
*'''Awareness''' — A measure of the character’s ''mental'' capacity, intelligence and perception
*'''Will''' — A measure of the character's force of personality, and ability to endure pain
*'''Health''' — A measure of the character’s ''physical'' stamina, ability to resist disease, and speed
*'''Fate''' — A measure of the character's luck and paranormal abilities.

Attribute scores progress exponentially, rather than linearly as is typical of many games.  Increasing an ability score by 3 is an approximate doubling of the Attribute.  For example, a Strength score of 9 could lift approximately 100&amp;nbsp;kg, while a score of 12 would double that to 200&amp;nbsp;kg.

A score of 5-9 is considered average for any human attribute, 13 is the upper limit of human ability, and anything over 15 considered legendary.

===Skills===
Skills are purchased using skill points in a similar manner to attributes. Each skill has an associated attribute; ''Firearms'' is based on Agility, ''Programming'' based on Awareness, etc. A character without any ability in a particular skill can use the base attribute with a penalty to determine the success of an action. Spending points on a skill will eliminate the penalty and spending more points will grant bonus dice.

The basic game system provides an extensive list of possible skills and specializations to them, and each setting comes with listings of additional setting-specific skills. Players are encouraged to create more skills as needed to cover whatever game setting or style they might want.

===Traits===
Traits are additional things about a character, positive or negative, that help flesh them out.  Traits are purchased using either AP or SP, depending on which trait is wanted.  Some negative traits give the player additional AP or SP to spend.

An example is the character's age.  Most characters are considered to start at between 16–20 years old (for humans).  An older character would lose Attribute Points, as an aging person would generally get physically weaker; but gain Skill Points, as they generally have learned more skills in their longer life.

Characters could also be more (or less) wealthy than average, or have a special ability like exceptional luck or the ability to use magic (depending on the game setting).  Various game setting include rules for many additional traits, and players are encouraged to create more as they see fit.

=== Success Rolls ===
''EABA'' is a d6-based [[dice pool]] system. A higher ability or skill level will allow a player to roll more dice to determine success or failure of an action, but only a limited number of dice - usually three, although there is a Trait that permits four or more under certain conditions - may be chosen from the total number of dice rolled. If there are more than three dice in the pool, one of them may be converted to a +2. So an action with a difficulty of 1 will always succeed, but an action with a difficulty higher than 20 will always fail, as 20 is the highest possible roll on 3d6+2. Additional factors may make an action more or less difficult, thus increasing or decreasing the number needed for success.

===Combat===
Combat in ''EABA'' is handled either by opposing rolls (mêlée) or against a set difficulty (ranged), both of which might be modified by things like target size, movement, visibility and so on. There are also numerous optional rules, such as explosions, called shots, hit locations and their specific damage effects, automatic fire, parrying etc.

Combat time in V2 is run on an expanding scale, something unique to EABA. In most RPGs, time in combat is broken down into small manageable chunks: a combat turn in GURPS is always one second, for example. A combat round is EABA starts at one second, the next is 2 seconds, then 4, 8, 15, 30, and one minute. The goal is to make time manageable, but also to allow characters to perform complex actions during combat without taking hours of play time to do so.

===Damage and defenses===
''EABA'' has three types of damage, lethal, half-lethal, and non-lethal.&lt;ref name="GR" /&gt; Cutting and piercing attacks tend to be lethal, crushing attacks half-lethal and unarmed attacks non-lethal. &lt;br&gt;
Armor is rated in terms of die(s) it will stop, and that is subtracted from the possible damage the attack may cause. So armor rated at 1d will reduce 1d of damage to nothing, and 2d of damage to 1d. Armor will generally ''always'' stop damage from attacks lower than its rating. For example, a bullet proof vest rated to stop .22 caliber rounds will always stop them, provided the round hits the vest. &lt;br&gt;
Additional damage to an already injured body part will have less effect than the first damage. ie, shooting someone in the leg once will reduce their mobility a lot and cause bleeding; shooting the same leg three more times will not reduce their mobility much more.

===Advancement===
Improving the characters is done with [[experience point]]s, which are either accumulated for general use by adventuring, or for specific skills by training.  Experience points can be used to improve both skills and attributes, with attributes costing much more to improve than skills.

A '''fact''' is something that is consistent with objective [[reality]] or that can be proven with [[evidence]]. The usual test for a statement of fact is verifiability — that is whether it can be demonstrated to correspond to [[experience]]. Standard reference works are often used to check facts. [[Science|Scientific]] facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement by [[experiments]] or other means.

== Etymology and usage ==
The word "fact" derives from the Latin ''factum'', and was first used in English with the same meaning: ''a thing done or performed'' a meaning now obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact". OED_2d_Ed_1989, (but note the conventional uses: ''after the fact'' and ''before the fact'').&lt;/ref&gt;  The common usage of "something that has really occurred or is the case" dates from the middle of the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (1a). OED_2d_Ed_1989 Joye ''Exp. Dan.'' xi. Z vij b, ''Let emprours and kinges know this godly kynges fact. 1545''&lt;/ref&gt;

Fact is sometimes used synonymously with ''[[truth]]'', as distinct from opinions, falsehoods, or matters of taste.  This use is found in such phrases as, "''It is a fact that the cup is blue"'' or "''Matter of fact"'',&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (4a) OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt; and "...&amp;nbsp;not history, nor fact, but imagination." Filmmaker [[Werner Herzog]] distinguishes between the two, claiming that "Fact creates norms, and truth illumination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wernerherzog.com/52.html |title=Werner Herzog Film: Statements / Texts |publisher=Wernerherzog.com |date=1999-04-30 |accessdate=2014-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715011254/http://www.wernerherzog.com/52.html |archivedate=2014-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fact also indicates a ''matter under discussion'' deemed to be true or correct, such as to emphasize a point or prove a disputed issue; (e.g., "...&amp;nbsp;the ''fact'' of the matter is ...").&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (6c). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(See also "Matter" (2,6). Compact_OED)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, ''fact'' may also indicate an ''allegation or stipulation'' of something that may or may not be a ''true fact'',&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (5). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., "the author's facts are not trustworthy"). This alternate usage, although contested by some, has a long history in standard English.&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', "Fact has a long history of usage in the sense 'allegation'" AHD_4th_Ed. The OED dates this use to 1729.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fact may also indicate findings derived through a ''process of evaluation'', including review of testimony, direct observation, or otherwise; as distinguishable from matters of inference or speculation.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (6a). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt; This use is reflected in the terms "fact-find" and "fact-finder" (e.g., "set up a [[fact-finding]] commission").&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (8). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Facts may be checked by reason, experiment, personal experience, or may be argued from authority.  [[Roger Bacon]] wrote "If in other sciences we should arrive at certainty without doubt and truth without error, it behooves us to place the foundations of knowledge in mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;Roger Bacon, translated by Robert Burke ''Opus Majus'', Book I, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==

In [[philosophy]], the concept ''fact'' is considered in [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]]. Questions of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and truth are closely associated with questions of fact. A "fact" can be defined as something that is the case—that is, a [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;"A fact, it might be said, is a state of affairs that is the case or obtains." – [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/states-of-affairs/ Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy. ''States of Affairs'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Wittgenstein, ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]],'' Proposition 2: What is the case -- a fact -- is the existence of states of affairs.&lt;/ref&gt;

Facts may be understood as information that makes a true sentence true.&lt;ref&gt;"A fact is, traditionally, the worldly correlate of a true proposition, a state of affairs whose obtaining makes that proposition true." – ''Fact'' in The Oxford Companion to Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; Facts may also be understood as those things to which a true sentence refers. The statement "Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system" is ''about'' the fact Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Oliver, ''Fact'', in {{cite book

===Correspondence and the slingshot argument===

[[Pascal Engel|Pascal Engel's]] version of the [[correspondence theory of truth]] explains that what makes a sentence true is that it ''corresponds'' to a fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title     = Truth

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This theory presupposes the existence of an objective world.

The [[Slingshot argument]] claims to show that all true statements stand for the same thing - the [[truth value]] ''true''. If this argument holds, and facts are taken to be what true statements stand for, then we reach the counter-intuitive conclusion that there is only one fact - ''the truth''.&lt;ref&gt;The argument is presented in many places, but see for example [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]], ''Truth and Meaning'', in {{cite book

| isbn        = 0-19-824617-X
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compound facts===

Any non-trivial true statement about [[reality]] is necessarily an abstraction composed of a complex of [[object (philosophy)|objects]] and [[property (philosophy)|properties]] or [[logic of relatives|relations]].&lt;ref&gt;"Facts possess internal structure, being complexes of objects and properties or relations" Oxford Companion to Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the fact described by the true statement "[[Paris]] is the capital city of [[France]]" implies that there is such a place as Paris, there is such a place as France, there are such things as capital cities, as well as that France has a government, that the government of France has the power to define its capital city, and that the French government has chosen Paris to be the capital, that there is such a thing as a ''place'' or a ''government'', and so on.  The verifiable accuracy of all of these assertions, if facts themselves, may coincide to create the fact that Paris is the capital of France.

Difficulties arise, however, in attempting to identify the constituent parts of negative, modal, disjunctive, or moral facts.&lt;ref&gt;''Fact'', in ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', Ted Honderich, editor. (Oxford, 1995) {{ISBN|0-19-866132-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fact–value distinction===
{{main|Fact–value distinction}}
Moral philosophers since [[David Hume#Ethics|David Hume]] have debated whether values are objective, and thus factual. In ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' Hume pointed out there is no obvious way for a series of statements about what ''ought'' to be the case to be derived from a series of statements of what ''is'' the case. Those who insist there is a logical gulf between [[Fact-value distinction|facts and values]], such that it is fallacious to attempt to derive values from facts, include [[G. E. Moore]], who called attempting to do so the [[naturalistic fallacy]].

===Factual–counterfactual distinction===
{{main|Counterfactual conditional}}

Factuality—what has occurred—can also be contrasted with counterfactuality:
what ''might have'' occurred, but did not. A counterfactual conditional or subjunctive conditional is a conditional (or "if-then") statement indicating what ''would be'' the case if events had been other than they were. For example, "If Alexander had lived, his empire would have been greater than Rome." This contrasts with an indicative conditional, which indicates what ''is'' (in fact) the case if its antecedent ''is'' (in fact) true—for example, "If you drink this, it will make you well."

Such sentences are important to [[modal logic]], especially since the development of [[possible world]] semantics.

==In science==
{{further|scientific method|philosophy of science}}

In science, a ''fact'' is a repeatable careful observation or measurement (by experimentation or other means), also called [[empirical evidence]].  Facts are central to building [[scientific theories]].  Various forms of observation and measurement lead to fundamental questions about the [[scientific method]], and the scope and validity of [[Philosophy of science|scientific reasoning]].

In the most basic sense, a scientific ''fact'' is an objective and verifiable observation, in contrast with a ''[[hypothesis]]'' or ''[[theory]]'', which is intended to explain or interpret facts.&lt;ref name="Gower000"&gt;{{cite book
| title     = Scientific Method: A Historical and Philosophical Introduction
| first     = Barry
| last      = Gower
| publisher = Routledge
| year      = 1997
| isbn        = 0-415-12282-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[scholars]] have offered significant refinements to this basic formulation.  Scientists are careful to distinguish between: 1) ''states of affairs'' in the external world and 2) ''assertions'' of fact that may be considered relevant in scientific analysis. The term is used in both senses in the philosophy of science.&lt;ref name="Ravetz000"&gt;{{cite book
| title     = Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems
| first     = Jerome Raymond
| last      = Ravetz
| publisher = Transaction Publishers
| year      = 1996
| isbn        = 1-56000-851-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars and clinical researchers in both the social and natural sciences have written about numerous questions and theories that arise in the attempt to clarify the fundamental nature of scientific fact.&lt;ref&gt;(Gower 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Pertinent issues raised by this inquiry include:
* the process by which "established fact" becomes recognized and accepted as such;&lt;ref&gt;(see e.g., Ravetz, p. 182 fn. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;
* whether and to what extent "fact" and "theoretic explanation" can be considered truly independent and separable from one another;&lt;ref&gt;Ravetz, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gower, p. 138"&gt;Gower, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;
* to what extent "facts" are influenced by the mere act of observation;&lt;ref name="Gower, p. 138"/&gt; and
* to what extent factual conclusions are influenced by history and consensus, rather than a strictly systematic methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Gower, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistent with the idea of [[confirmation holism]], some scholars assert "fact" to be necessarily "theory-laden" to some degree. [[Thomas Kuhn]] points out that knowing what facts to measure, and how to measure them, requires the use of other theories. For example, the age of [[fossils]] is based on [[radiometric dating]], which is justified by reasoning that radioactive decay follows a [[Poisson process]] rather than a [[Bernoulli process]]. Similarly, [[Percy Williams Bridgman]] is credited with the methodological position known as operationalism, which asserts that all observations are not only influenced, but necessarily defined by the means and assumptions used to measure them.

=== The scientific method ===
Apart from the fundamental inquiry into the nature of scientific fact, there remain the practical and social considerations of how fact is investigated, established, and substantiated through the proper application of the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;Ravetz p. 181 et. seq. (Chapter Six: "Facts and their evolution")&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific facts are generally believed independent of the observer: no matter who performs a scientific experiment, all observers agree on the outcome.&lt;ref name="The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine"&gt;Cassell, Eric J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=K1kjFYrliTMC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;ots=3V6-UmUFmP&amp;dq=%22scientific+fact&amp;sig=YtQTgNbisFSQ1QfV-JNkmW7D0n4#PPA181,M1 The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine] ''[[Oxford University Press]]''. Retrieved 16 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to these considerations, there are the social and institutional measures, such as peer review and accreditation, that are intended to promote ''factual accuracy'' (among other interests) in scientific study.&lt;ref&gt;(Ravetz 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

== In history ==
{{further|Historiography}}

A common rhetorical cliché states, "[[History is written by the winners]]." This phrase suggests but does not examine the use of facts in the writing of history.

[[E. H. Carr]] in his 1961 volume ''[[What is History?]]'' argues that the inherent biases from the gathering of facts makes the objective truth of any historical [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] [[idealistic]] and impossible. Facts are, "like fish in the Ocean," of which we may only happen to catch a few, only an indication of what is below the surface. Even a dragnet cannot tell us for certain what it would be like to live below the Ocean's surface. Even if we do not discard any facts (or fish) presented, we will always miss the majority; the site of our fishing, the methods undertaken, the weather and even luck play a vital role in what we will catch. Additionally, the composition of history is inevitably made up by the compilation of many different biases of fact finding - all compounded over time. He concludes that for a historian to attempt a more objective method, one must accept that history can only aspire to a conversation of the present with the past - and that one's methods of fact gathering should be openly examined.  Historical truth and facts therefore change over time, and reflect only the present consensus (if that).

=== Legal pleadings ===
{{main|Pleading}}
A party to a civil suit generally must clearly state all relevant allegations of fact that form the basis of a [[Claim (legal)|claim]]. The requisite level of precision and particularity of these allegations varies, depending on the rules of civil procedure and jurisdiction. Parties who face uncertainties regarding facts and circumstances attendant to their side in a dispute may sometimes invoke alternative pleading.&lt;ref&gt;Roy W. McDonald, ''Alternative Pleading in the United States: I'' Columbia Law Review, Vol. 52, No. 4 (Apr., 1952), pp. 443-478&lt;/ref&gt; In this situation, a party may plead separate sets of facts that (when considered together) may be contradictory or mutually exclusive. This (seemingly) logically-inconsistent presentation of facts may be necessary as a safeguard against contingencies (such as ''[[res judicata]]'') that would otherwise preclude presenting a claim or defense that depends on a particular interpretation of the underlying facts.&lt;ref&gt;(McDonald 1952)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quantum field theory}}
In [[physics]], the '''fine-structure constant''', also known as '''Sommerfeld's constant''', commonly denoted {{math|''α''}} (the [[Alpha|Greek letter ''alpha'']]), is a [[dimensionless physical constant]] characterizing the strength of the [[electromagnetic interaction]] between elementary charged particles. It is related to the [[elementary charge]] {{math|''e''}}, which characterizes the strength of the coupling of an elementary charged particle with the [[electromagnetic field]], by the formula {{math|1=4π''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''ħcα'' = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Being a [[dimensionless quantity]], it has the same numerical value of about {{sfrac|137}} in all [[system of units|systems of units]].

==Definition==
Some equivalent definitions of {{math|''α''}} in terms of other fundamental [[physical constant]]s are:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{\hbar c} = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{e^2 c}{\hbar} = \frac{k_\text{e} e^2}{\hbar c} = \frac{c \mu_0}{2 R_\text{K}} = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi}\frac{Z_0}{\hbar}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*{{math|''e''}} is the [[elementary charge]] (:= 1.602176634×10&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt; C);
*{{math|π}} is the mathematical constant [[pi]];
*{{math|''ħ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''h''|2π}}}} is the reduced [[Planck constant]] (:= {{sfrac|6.62607015×10&lt;sup&gt;−34&lt;/sup&gt; |2π}}  J s);
*{{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light in vacuum]] (:= 299792458 m/s);
*{{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[electric constant]] or permittivity of free space;
*{{math|''µ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[magnetic constant]] or permeability of free space;
*{{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Coulomb constant]];
*{{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[von Klitzing constant]];
*{{math|''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[vacuum impedance]] or impedance of free space.

The definition reflects the relationship between {{math|''α''}} and the permeability of free space {{math|''µ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which equals &lt;math&gt;\mu_0 = \frac{2 \alpha}{e^2} \frac{h}{c}.&lt;/math&gt;In to the new SI system entering into force in 2019, 4{{pi}}&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;1.000 000 000 82 (20) 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; H·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is a value in the new system for {{math|''µ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} according to a new measurement of the fine structure constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/CGPM/Convocation-2018.pdf#page=30|title=Convocationde la Conférence générale des poids et mesures (26e réunion)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=Richard H.|last2=Yu|first2=Chenghui|last3=Zhong|first3=Weicheng|last4=Estey|first4=Brian|last5=Müller|first5=Holger|date=2018-04-13|title=Measurement of the fine-structure constant as a test of the Standard Model|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/191|journal=Science|language=en|volume=360|issue=6385|pages=191–195|doi=10.1126/science.aap7706|issn=0036-8075|pmid=29650669}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Richard S.|date=2017|title=Determining the value of the fine-structure constant from a current balance: Getting acquainted with some upcoming changes to the SI|url=https://doi.org/10.1119/1.4976701|journal=American Journal of Physics|language=en|volume=85|issue=5|pages=364–368|doi=10.1119/1.4976701|issn=0002-9505|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===In non-SI units===
In electrostatic [[cgs]] units, the unit of [[electric charge]], the [[statcoulomb]], is defined so that the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb constant]], {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}}, or the [[electric constant|permittivity factor]], {{math|4π''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, is 1 and [[dimensionless]]. Then the expression of the fine-structure constant, as commonly found in older physics literature, becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{e^2}{\hbar c}. &lt;/math&gt;

In [[natural units]], commonly used in high energy physics, where {{math|1=''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''c'' = ''ħ'' = 1}}, the value of the fine-structure constant is&lt;ref&gt;

|isbn=978-0-201-50397-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi}. &lt;/math&gt;
As such, the fine-structure constant is just another, albeit dimensionless, quantity determining (or determined by) the [[elementary charge]]: {{math|1=''e'' = {{radic|4π''α''}} ≈ {{val|0.30282212}}}} in terms of such a natural unit of charge.

In [[atomic units]] ({{math|1=''e'' = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = ''ħ'' = 1}} and {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|1|4π}}}}), the fine structure constant is
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{1}{c}. &lt;/math&gt;

This has a relative standard uncertainty of 0.23&amp;nbsp;[[parts per billion]].&lt;ref name="CODATA 2014"/&gt;

For reasons of convenience, historically the value of the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the fine-structure constant is often specified. The 2014 CODATA recommended value is given by&lt;ref name="CODATA 2014"/&gt;
:{{math|''α''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} {{val|137.035999139|(31)}}.}}

While the value of {{math|''α''}} can be ''estimated'' from the values of the constants appearing in any of its definitions, the theory of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) provides a way to measure {{math|''α''}} directly using the [[quantum Hall effect]] or the [[anomalous magnetic moment]] of the [[electron]]. The theory of QED predicts a relationship between the [[g-factor (physics)|dimensionless magnetic moment]] of the [[electron]] and the fine-structure constant {{math|''α''}} (the magnetic moment of the electron is also referred to as "[[Landé g-factor|Landé {{math|''g''}}-factor]]" and symbolized as {{math|''g''}}). The most precise value of {{math|''α''}} obtained experimentally (as of 2012) is based on a measurement of {{math|''g''}} using a one-electron so-called "quantum cyclotron" apparatus, together with a calculation via the theory of QED that involved {{val|12672}} tenth-order [[Feynman diagrams]]:&lt;ref&gt;

==Physical interpretations==
The fine-structure constant, {{math|''α''}}, has several physical interpretations. {{math|''α''}} is:
*The square of the ratio of the [[elementary charge]] to the [[Planck charge]]
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \left( \frac{e}{q_\text{P}} \right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;
*The ratio of two energies: (i) the energy needed to overcome the [[electrostatic repulsion]] between two electrons a distance of {{math|''d''}} apart, and (ii) the energy of a single [[photon]] of wavelength {{math|''λ'' {{=}} 2π''d''}} (or of [[wavelength#Angular wavelength|angular wavelength]] {{math|''d''}}; see [[Planck relation]]):

*Alpha is related to the probability that an electron will emit or absorb a photon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leon M. Lederman|Lederman, Leon]], ''The God Particle: If the Universe is the Answer, What is the Question?'' (1993), [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]], pp. 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]] is applied to [[quantum electrodynamics]], the resulting [[perturbative]] expansions for physical results are expressed as sets of [[power series]] in {{math|''α''}}. Because {{math|''α''}} is much less than one, higher powers of {{math|''α''}} are soon unimportant, making the perturbation theory practical in this case. On the other hand, the large value of the corresponding factors in [[quantum chromodynamics]] makes calculations involving the [[strong nuclear force]] extremely difficult.

===Variation with energy scale===
According to the theory of the [[renormalization group]], the value of the fine-structure constant (the strength of the electromagnetic interaction) grows [[logarithm]]ically as the [[energy scale]] is increased. The observed value of {{math|''α''}} is associated with the energy scale of the [[electron mass]]; the electron is a lower bound for this energy scale because it (and the [[positron]]) is the lightest charged object whose [[quantum loop]]s can contribute to the running. Therefore, {{sfrac|1|137.036}} is the value of the fine-structure constant at zero energy. Moreover, as the energy scale increases, the strength of the electromagnetic interaction approaches that of the other two [[fundamental interaction]]s, a fact important for [[grand unification]] theories. If quantum electrodynamics were an exact theory, the fine-structure constant would actually diverge at an energy known as the [[Landau pole]]. This fact makes quantum electrodynamics inconsistent beyond the [[perturbative]] expansions.

==History==
[[File:Sommerfeld-Muenchen.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Sommerfeld memorial at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]] ]]
Based on the precise measurement of the hydrogen atom spectrum by [[Albert A. Michelson|Michelson]] and [[Edward W. Morley|Morley]],&lt;ref&gt;AA. Michelson and E. W. Morley, Amer. J. Sci.34, 427 (1887); Phil Mag. 24, 463 (1887)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] extended the [[Bohr model]] to include elliptical orbits and relativistic dependence of mass on velocity. He introduced a term for the fine-structure constant in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Sommerfeld, Arnold (1919). "Atombau und Spektrallinien". Braunschweig: Friedrich Vieweg und Sohn. {{ISBN|3-87144-484-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first physical interpretation of the fine-structure constant {{math|''α''}} was as the ratio of the velocity of the electron in the first circular orbit of the relativistic [[Bohr atom]] to the [[speed of light]] in the vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equivalently, it was the quotient between the minimum [[angular momentum]] allowed by relativity for a closed orbit, and the minimum angular momentum allowed for it by quantum mechanics. It appears naturally in Sommerfeld's analysis, and determines the size of the splitting or [[fine structure|fine-structure]] of the hydrogenic [[Lyman series|spectral lines]].

With the development of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) the significance of α has broadened from a spectroscopic phenomenon to a general coupling constant for the electromagnetic field, determining the strength of the interaction between electrons and photons. The term {{math|{{sfrac|''α''|2π}}}} is engraved on the tombstone of one of the pioneers of QED, [[Julian Schwinger]], referring to his calculation of the [[anomalous magnetic dipole moment]].

==Is the fine-structure constant actually constant?==
{{Further|Time-variation of physical constants}}
Physicists have pondered whether the fine-structure constant is in fact constant, or whether its value differs by location and over time. A varying {{math|''α''}} has been proposed as a way of solving problems in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] and [[astrophysics]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[String theory]] and other proposals for going beyond the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics have led to theoretical interest in whether the accepted [[physical constant]]s (not just {{math|''α''}}) actually vary.

In the experiments below, {{math|Δ''α''}} represents the change in {{math|''α''}} over time, which can be computed by {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;prev&lt;/sub&gt; − ''α''&lt;sub&gt;now&lt;/sub&gt;}}. If the fine-structure constant really is a constant, then any experiment should show that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta \alpha}{\alpha} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \frac{\alpha _\mathrm{prev}-\alpha _\mathrm{now}}{\alpha_\mathrm{now}}=0,&lt;/math&gt;
or as close to zero as experiment can measure. Any value far away from zero would indicate that {{math|''α''}} does change over time. So far, most experimental data is consistent with {{math|''α''}} being constant.

===Past rate of change===
The first experimenters to test whether the fine-structure constant might actually vary examined the [[spectral line]]s of distant astronomical objects and the products of [[radioactive decay]] in the [[Oklo]] [[natural nuclear fission reactor]]. Their findings were consistent with no variation in the fine-structure constant between these two vastly separated locations and times.&lt;ref&gt;

In other words, they measured the value to be somewhere between {{val|−0.0000047}} and {{val|−0.0000067}}. This is a very small value, nearly zero, but their error bars do not actually include zero. This result either indicates that ''α'' is not constant or that there is experimental error that the experimenters did not know how to measure.

In 2004, a smaller study of 23 absorption systems by Chand ''et al.'', using the [[Very Large Telescope]], found no measurable variation:&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They proposed using this effect to measure the value of {{math|''α''}} during the epoch before the formation of the first stars. In principle, this technique provides enough information to measure a variation of 1 part in {{val|e=9}} (4 orders of magnitude better than the current quasar constraints). However, the constraint which can be placed on {{math|''α''}} is strongly dependent upon effective integration time, going as {{math|''t''&lt;sup&gt;−{{1/2}}&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The European [[LOFAR]] [[radio telescope]] would only be able to constrain {{math|{{sfrac|Δ''α''|''α''}}}} to about 0.3%.&lt;ref name=Khatri/&gt; The collecting area required to constrain Δ''α''/''α'' to the current level of quasar constraints is on the order of 100&amp;nbsp;square kilometers, which is economically impracticable at the present time.

===Spatial variation – Australian dipole===
In September 2010 researchers from Australia said they had identified a dipole-like structure in the variation of the fine-structure constant across the observable universe. They used data on [[quasar]]s obtained by the [[Very Large Telescope]], combined with the previous data obtained by Webb at the [[Keck telescopes]]. The fine-structure constant appears to have been larger by one part in 100,000 in the direction of the southern hemisphere constellation [[Ara (constellation)|Ara]], 10&amp;nbsp;billion years ago. Similarly, the constant appeared to have been smaller by a similar fraction in the northern direction, 10 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In September and October 2010, after Webb's released research, physicists [[Chad Orzel]] and [[Sean M. Carroll]] suggested various approaches of how Webb's observations may be wrong. Orzel argues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why I'm Skeptical About the Changing Fine-Structure Constant |url=http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2010/09/14/httpksjtrackermitedu20100907e/ |first=Chad |last=Orzel |authorlink=Chad Orzel |date=14 October 2010 |publisher=ScienceBlogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the study may contain wrong data due to subtle differences in the two telescopes, in which one of the telescopes the data set was slightly high and on the other slightly low, so that they cancel each other out when they overlapped. He finds it suspicious that the sources showing the greatest changes are all observed by one telescope, with the region observed by both telescopes aligning so well with the sources where no effect is observed. Carroll suggested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Fine Structure Constant is Probably Constant |url=http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2010/10/18/the-fine-structure-constant-is-probably-constant/ |first=Sean M. |last=Carroll |authorlink=Sean M. Carroll |date=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a totally different approach; he looks at the fine-structure constant as a scalar field and claims that if the telescopes are correct and the fine-structure constant varies smoothly over the universe, then the scalar field must have a very small mass. However, previous research has shown that the mass is not likely to be extremely small. Both of these scientists' early criticisms point to the fact that different techniques are needed to confirm or contradict the results, as Webb, et al., also concluded in their study.

In October 2011, Webb ''et al.'' reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Anthropic explanation==
The [[anthropic principle]] is a controversial argument of why the fine-structure constant has the value it does: stable matter, and therefore life and intelligent beings, could not exist if its value were much different. For instance, were {{math|''α''}} to change by 4%, stellar [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] would not produce [[carbon]], so that carbon-based life would be impossible. If {{math|''α''}} were greater than 0.1, stellar fusion would be impossible and no place in the universe would be warm enough for life as we know it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Numerological explanations and multiverse theory==
As a dimensionless constant which does not seem to be directly related to any [[mathematical constant]], the fine-structure constant has long fascinated physicists.

[[Arthur Eddington]] argued that the value could be "obtained by pure deduction" and he related it to the [[Eddington number]], his estimate of the number of protons in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led him in 1929 to conjecture that the reciprocal of the fine-structure constant was not [[almost integer|approximately the integer]] 137, but precisely the [[integer]] [[137 (number)|137]]. Other physicists neither adopted this conjecture nor accepted his arguments but by the 1940s experimental values for {{math|{{sfrac|1|''α''}}}} deviated sufficiently from 137 to refute Eddington's argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fine-structure constant so intrigued physicist [[Wolfgang Pauli]] that he collaborated with psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]] in a quest to understand its significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Max Born]] believed that would the value of alpha differ, the universe would degenerate. Thus, he asserted that {{sfrac|1|137}} is a law of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|author = A.I. Miller
|year = 2009
|title = Deciphering the Cosmic Number: The Strange Friendship of Wolfgang Pauli and Carl Jung
|page= 253
|publisher = [[W.W. Norton &amp; Co.|W.W. Norton &amp; Co]]
|isbn = 978-0-393-06532-9
|quote = '''Max Born''': If alpha were bigger than it really is, we should not be able to distinguish matter from ether [the vacuum, nothingness], and our task to disentangle the natural laws would be hopelessly difficult. The fact however that alpha has just its value 1/137 is certainly no chance but itself a law of nature. It is clear that the explanation of this number must be the central problem of natural philosophy.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Feynman]], one of the originators and early developers of the theory of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED), referred to the fine-structure constant in these terms:

{{quote|There is a most profound and beautiful question associated with the observed coupling constant, {{math|''e''}} – the amplitude for a real electron to emit or absorb a real photon. It is a simple number that has been experimentally determined to be close to 0.08542455. (My physicist friends won't recognize this number, because they like to remember it as the inverse of its square: about 137.03597 with about an uncertainty of about 2 in the last decimal place. It has been a mystery ever since it was discovered more than fifty years ago, and all good theoretical physicists put this number up on their wall and worry about it.) Immediately you would like to know where this number for a coupling comes from: is it related to pi or perhaps to the base of natural logarithms? Nobody knows. It's one of the greatest damn mysteries of physics: a magic number that comes to us with no understanding by man. You might say the "hand of God" wrote that number, and "we don't know how He pushed his pencil." We know what kind of a dance to do experimentally to measure this number very accurately, but we don't know what kind of dance to do on the computer to make this number come out, without putting it in secretly!|[[Richard Feynman]]|{{cite book

}}}}

Conversely, statistician [[I. J. Good]] argued that a numerological explanation would only be acceptable if it came from a more fundamental theory that also provided a Platonic explanation of the value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]
|page=141
|isbn=978-0-19-853215-6
|quote = '''[[I. J. Good]]''': There have been a few examples of numerology that have led to theories that transformed society: see the mention of Kirchhoff and Balmer in Good (1962, p. 316) … and one can well include Kepler on account of his third law. It would be fair enough to say that numerology was the origin of the theories of electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, gravitation.... So I intend no disparagement when I describe a formula as numerological. When a numerological formula is proposed, then we may ask whether it is correct. … I think an appropriate definition of correctness is that the formula has a good explanation, in a Platonic sense, that is, the explanation could be based on a good theory that is not yet known but ‘exists’ in the universe of possible reasonable ideas.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Attempts to find a mathematical basis for this dimensionless constant have continued up to the present time. However, no numerological explanation has ever been accepted by the community.

In the early 21st century, multiple physicists, including [[Stephen Hawking]] in his book ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'', began exploring the idea of a [[multiverse]], and the fine-structure constant was one of several universal constants that suggested the idea of a [[fine-tuned universe]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Stephen Hawking]] |year=1988 |title=A Brief History of Time |publisher=Bantam Books |isbn=978-0-553-05340-1 |pages=7, 125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
It is Stamford's first nonprofit modern art gallery and is located in a renovated brick townhouses originally built in the 1880s. It exhibits works by emerging artists and strives to be a cultural laboratory where artists and community members can collaborate and interact.  Works also include performances of experimental music and [[performance art]] projects. In 2012 it received a grant from the [[Andy Warhol#Foundation|Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts]]&lt;ref name="SA2"&gt;[http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/printpromotion/article/City-Hall-s-top-lawyer-wields-power-over-6433510.php Elizabeth Kim, “Quiet Influence”, Stamford Advocate, 9 August 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Stamford Daily Voice:  "Franklin Street Works provides the region with critically acclaimed contemporary art exhibitions and programming, garnering positive reviews in international publications such as ArtForum online, Art Papers and Hyperallergic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://stamford.dailyvoice.com/neighbors/stamfords-franklin-street-works-matches-7500-grant-challenge/533203/|title = Stamford's Franklin Street Works Matches $7,500 Grant Challenge|website = Stamford Daily Voice|access-date = 2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes approximately three original contemporary art exhibitions each year.

==Notable exhibits==
'''I hear it everywhere I go''', September 2017 – January 2018.  A collection of works focussed on the disillusionment with the [[American Dream]].  The show was inspired by artist [[Cady Noland]]'s 1987 essay "Towards a Metalanguage of E V I L" and built around socially acceptable forms of violence used to express that discontent.  The show was curated by Franklin Street Works creative director, Terri C. Smith.  &lt;ref&gt;[https://artwriting.sva.edu/journal/post/good-times Emma Drew, “Good Times”, ArtWriting MFA, 4 January 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://brooklynrail.org/2018/02/artseen/Inside-and-Outside-Cady-Noland-and-the-Violence-of-the-Everyday Andreas Petrossionts, “Inside and Outside: Cady Noland and the Violence of the Everyday”, The Brooklyn Rail, 7 February 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibiting artists include [[Alex Bag]], Michael Blake, [[Nayland Blake]], [[Jen DeNike]], [[Jonah Freeman]] &amp; Justin Lowe, [[Rashid Johnson]], [[Adam McEwen]], [[Rodney McMillian]], [[Tameka Norris]], [[Cheryl Pope]], [[Mikel Rouse]], and [[Melissa Vandenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Terri, "I hear it everywhere I go", Show program, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Sunken Living Room''', April – May 2014.  Participating artists investigated the financial crisis, from issues around labor, debt and unemployment to corrupt banking practices and post-industrial urban landscapes, through sculpture, video, texts, drawings, prints and photos. Among other pieces was a sculpture by [[Constantina Zavitsanos]] that was a recording of her student debt printed out in hourly increments on paper over a three-year time span. As Zavitsanos put it “When you have a lot of material, you make something out of it. And I had a lot of debt.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ctpost.com/entertainment/article/Art-in-the-time-of-recession-at-Franklin-Street-5410660.php|title=Art in the time of recession at Franklin Street Works|website=Connecticut Post|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gravity-gradient stabilization''' (a.k.a. "tidal stabilization") is a method of stabilizing [[artificial satellite]]s or [[space tether]]s in a fixed orientation using only the orbited body's mass distribution and gravitational field.  The main advantage over using active stabilization with [[propellant]]s, [[gyroscope]]s or [[reaction wheel]]s is the low use of power and resources.

The idea is to use the [[Earth]]'s [[gravitational field]] and [[tidal forces]] to keep the spacecraft aligned in the desired orientation.  The [[gravity]] of the Earth decreases according to the [[inverse-square law]], and by extending the long axis perpendicular to the orbit, the "lower" part of the orbiting structure will be more attracted to the Earth.  The effect is that the satellite will tend to align its axis of minimum [[moment of inertia]] vertically.

The first experimental attempt to use the technique on a human spaceflight was performed on September 13, 1966, on the US [[Gemini 11]] mission, by attaching the Gemini spacecraft to its [[Agena target vehicle]] by a {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} tether. The attempt was a failure, as insufficient gradient was produced to keep the tether taut.&lt;ref name="Gatland"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique was first successfully used in a near-[[geosynchronous orbit]] on the [[DODGE (satellite)|Department of Defense Gravity Experiment]] (DODGE) satellite in July 1967.&lt;ref name="Guenter"&gt;[http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/dodge.htm Gunter's Space Page: DODGE]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first used for [[low Earth orbit]] and tested unsuccessfully for [[geosynchronous orbit]] in the [[Applications Technology Satellite]]s [[ATS-2]], [[ATS-4]] and [[ATS-5]] from 1966 until 1969.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The lunar orbiter [[Explorer 49]] launched in 1973 was gravity gradient oriented (Z axis parallel to local vertical).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1973-039A|title=NASA NSSDCA Spacecraft Details - Explorer 49|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Long Duration Exposure Facility]] (LDEF) used this method for 3-axis stabilization; yaw about the vertical axis was stabilized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a266026.pdf Lesson learned from the Long Duration Exposure Facility. Stuckey. 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}}

An example of gravity-gradient stabilization was attempted during NASA's TSS-1 mission in July, 1992. The project failed because of tether deployment problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/BF02506678|title = A technical overview of TSS-1: The first Tethered-Satellite system mission|journal = Il Nuovo Cimento C|volume = 17|pages = 1–12|year = 1994|last1 = Dobrowolny|first1 = M|last2 = Stone|first2 = N.

{{Grey market}}
'''Green market products''' are previously owned products that have been previously used and put back into productive use.  These products are often repaired, refurbished and recycled by [[broker]]s, resellers or the original [[manufacturer]].  They are suitable for resale to customers as a lower cost alternative to buying new goods from standard distribution channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascdi.com/terminology/|title=Find Terms and Definitions for the ASCDI Industry and the Telecom Industry|website=www.ascdi.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of term==
The term "green market" refers to the fact that the resold goods are put back into productive use, which is the most environmentally friendly use of used or discontinued products.

Although the resale of green market goods sometimes competes with the original manufacturer, it also helps the manufacturer and the original end user by allowing the original end user to receive value for the product they no longer need and to use that value in purchasing new goods from the manufacturer.

Parts from green market goods are sometimes [[Need|necessary]] for the maintenance of current products that are in need of replacement parts which are no longer available.

==Black, grey and green market laws ==

Manufacturers that produce products including computer, telecom equipment, technology equipment very often sell those products that equipment through distributors. Most distribution agreements require the distributor to resell the products strictly to end users. However, some distributors choose to resell those products to other resellers.  In the late 1980s manufacturers labeled the resold products as "grey market".

There is nothing illegal about buying "grey market" products. In fact, the US Supreme Court has upheld that grey market products are legal for resale in the United States regardless of where they were produced or originally sold.  The EU Supreme Court has similarly ruled that grey market products are legal for resale in the EU, provided that the equipment was originally sold by the manufacturer inside the EU.

Manufacturers created the term "grey market" in an effort to instill fear in customers that buying such equipment was somehow illegal in an effort to assure manufacturers that customers would only purchase buy directly from them.

The term "grey market" was chosen because of it similarity to the old term "Black Market" which refers to stolen and illegal products.

===Ecology===
Putting green market products into productive use or using the parts from green market products for repair is very cost effective and environmentally responsible.  Replacing broken products with newer products has a negative effect on the environment and has been recognized as [[ecologically]] [[hazardous]].

===Raw materials===
Electronic equipment is made up of many precious materials including highly refined glass, gold, aluminum, silver, polymers, copper and brass. Electronic recycling companies have the ability to store, disassemble, separate and transport these materials to companies for reuse in manufacturing.  This is an environmentally better solution than dumping the used products in landfills. Such dumping may pollute soil and water with dangerous and non-biodegradable waste.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9368">'''The Gumshoe System''' (stylised as ''The GUMSHOE System'') is a [[role-playing game system]] created in 2007 by [[Robin Laws]], designed for running investigative scenarios. The premise is that investigative games are not about finding clues, they are about interpreting the clues that are found. The ''Gumshoe System'' is used in various games published by [[Pelgrane Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011|isbn=978-1-907702-58-7|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the Hillfolk kickstarter, the SRD for the ''GUMSHOE System'' has been made available for use under two open licenses: the [[Open Game License|Open Game License (OGL)]] and [[Creative Commons|Creative Commons (CC)]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://site.pelgranepress.com/index.php/the-gumshoe-system-reference-document/ The GUMSHOE System SRD]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Of the games in the line, ''[[Trail of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Trail of Cthulhu]]'' won the 2010 Lucca Games award for best role-playing game&lt;ref&gt;[http://rpggeek.com/rpg/452/trail-of-cthulhu RPG Geek profile of Trail of Cthulhu]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Ashen Stars]]'' was a 2011 nominee for the [[Origins Award]] for best RPG.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rpggeek.com/rpg/10264/ashen-stars RPG Geek profile of Ashen Stars]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
The ''Gumshoe System'' is designed around the idea that investigative scenarios are difficult to run with most role-playing systems. The problem is identified as important clues being missed due to failed dice-rolls, resulting in play grinding to a halt.

The ''Gumshoe System'' is designed to solve this by making the game not about finding clues, but about interpreting them. Attention is given to designing investigative scenarios, while at the same time the focus is put on encouraging the players to take control of the investigation (and, thereby, the story being told).

The ''Gumshoe System'' is player-centric, putting die rolling in the hands of the players whenever possible. [[Non-player character]] abilities either modify the roll made by the player, or succeeds or fails depending on what the [[game master]] finds dramatically appropriate. Direct conflict between characters, such as combat, is an exception.

==Character creation==
[[Player characters]] in the ''Gumshoe System'' are created by using '''build points''' to buy '''rating points''' in character '''abilities'''. Points are spent on a one-for-one basis.

Each player character receives a number of investigative build points depending on the number of players and the setting. In ''The Esoterrorists'' setting, two players receive 32 investigative build points each, while five or more players receive 20 build points each. Any number of investigative build points can be spent on an investigative ability, though more than 3 or 4 points is rarely useful.

Each player character receives a number of general build points depending on the setting, but regardless of number of players. In ''The Esoterrorists'' setting players receive 60 general build points each. Any number of general build points can be spent on a general ability, as long as the second highest rated ability is at least half that of the highest rated. After a scenario is completed, player characters receive new build points which can be used as either investigative or general build points. The amount acquired depends on the length of the scenario. There are no levels through which player characters progress.

==Game mechanics==
All mechanics in the ''Gumshoe System'' revolve around character [[Statistic (role-playing games)#Skills|abilities]]. [[Attribute_(role-playing_games)|Attributes]], common to most [[role-playing games]], are not used in ''Gumshoe''. Rating points goes into a '''pool''' of points that can be used in '''spends''' related to that ability. Spent or lost points from ability pools are '''refreshed''' at various points of play.

===Investigative abilities===
The purpose of investigative abilities is to find clues that advance the story. These clues are called '''core clues'''. Investigative abilities always work; there are no dice rolls involved. If a scene contains a core clue and a player character uses an investigative ability that relates to the clue, the character will find the clue.

A spend for an investigative ability costs 1 or 2 points. A spend gives additional clues. These clues are not necessary to solve the scenario, though they should give additional information or other benefits. Spent pool points from investigative abilities are refreshed between scenarios.

Example of investigative abilities: Architecture, Cop Talk, Forensic Accounting.

===General abilities===
General abilities are used when an unknown outcome is dramatically appropriate. For these situations, the Gumshoe System utilizes a single six-sided die, which is rolled against a '''difficulty''' (or target number). This is called a '''test'''. The standard difficulty is 4, though it can be modified to anything from 2 to 8 to represent special circumstances.

As long as the die roll is equal to or higher than the difficulty, the player character has succeeded in its action.

A spend for a general ability can be as high as that ability's pool. Each point spent adds 1 to the die roll. Spent pool points from general abilities are refreshed between scenarios, though special circumstances can refresh some points during play.

Example of general abilities: Athletics, Health, Shooting.

====Health and stability====
Though Health and Stability are general abilities, they function differently. While other abilities are exhausted once they reach 0, Health and Stability can reach negative numbers. This represents serious injury or mental illness. If either ability reaches −12, the player character has died or gone permanently insane.

Use of appropriate abilities can refresh some spent or lost points in Health and Stability during play. Apart from that, Stability refreshes between scenarios, while the player character is required to rest to refresh Health.

==Products==
[[Pelgrane Press]] has produced a number of games that use the ''Gumshoe System''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://site.pelgranepress.com/index.php/gumshoe/|title=GUMSHOE|website=Pelgrane Press Ltd|language=en-us|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Production Possibilities Frontier Curve.svg|thumb|220px|right|The production possibilities frontier (PPF) for guns versus butter. Points like ''X'' that are outside the PPF are impossible to achieve. Points such as ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' illustrate the tradeoff between guns and butter: at these levels of production, producing more of one requires producing less of the other. Points located along the PPF curve represent sustainable combinations of each type of production in a world where scarcity is a binding constrain. ''A'', however, is inside of the PPF and represents a combination of output that is not utilizing all available resources.]]
In [[macroeconomics]], the '''guns versus butter model''' is an example of a simple [[production–possibility frontier]]. It demonstrates the relationship between a nation's investment in [[Military budget|defense]] and civilian goods. In this example, a nation has to choose between two options when spending its finite resources. It may buy either guns (invest in defense/military) or butter (invest in production of goods), or a combination of both. This may be seen as an analogy for choices between defense and civilian spending in more complex economies.

The "guns or butter" model is used generally as a simplification of national spending as a part of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. The nation will have to decide which balance of guns versus butter best fulfills its needs, with its choice being partly influenced by the military spending and military stance of potential opponents. Researchers in [[political economy]] have viewed the trade-off between military and [[consumer spending]] as a useful predictor of election success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hibbs |first=Douglas |title=The 2010 Midterm Election for the US House of Representatives |work=CEFOS Working Paper |volume=9 |year=2010 |url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/id/eprint/25918 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
One theory on the origin of the concept comes from [[William Jennings Bryan]]'s resignation as [[United States Secretary of State]] in the [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://political-economy.com/guns-or-butter/ |title=Guns or Butter |website=Political-economy.com |date=2011-11-24 |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the outbreak of [[World War I]], the leading global exporter of [[nitrate]]s for [[gunpowder]] was [[Chile]]. Chile had maintained neutrality during the war and provided nearly all of the US's nitrate requirements. It was also the principal ingredient of chemical fertilizer in farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.american.edu/ted/nitrate.htm |title=Chile Nitrates Exports |website=American.edu |date=1994-03-09 |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The export product was [[sodium nitrate]], a salt mined in the northern part of Chile which is often called ''[[Chile saltpeter|Chilean saltpeter]].''{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

With substantial popular opinion running against US entry into the war, the Bryan resignation and peace campaign (joined prominently with [[Henry Ford]]'s efforts) became a banner for local versus national interests. However, Bryan was no more pro-German than the infamously nativistic Wilson; his motivation, instead, was to expose and publicize what he considered to be an unconscionable public policy.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The [[National Defense Act of 1916]] directed the president to select a site for the artificial production of nitrates within the United States. It was not until September 1917, several months after the United States entered World War I, that Wilson selected [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]], after more than a year of competition among political rivals. A deadlock in the Congress was broken when South Carolina Senator [[Ellison D. Smith]] sponsored the National Defense Act of 1916 that directed "the Secretary of Agriculture to manufacture nitrates for fertilizers in peace and munitions in war at water power sites designated by the President." This was presented by the news media as "guns and butter."{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Quoted use of the term==

Perhaps the best known use of the phrase (in translation) was in [[Nazi Germany]]. In a speech on January 17, 1936, Minister of Propaganda [[Joseph Goebbels]] stated: "We can do without butter, but, despite all our love of peace, not without arms. One cannot shoot with butter, but with guns." Referencing the same concept, sometime in the summer of the same year another Nazi official, [[Hermann Göring]], announced in a speech: "Guns will make us powerful; butter will only make us fat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Columbia World of Quotations |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=1996 |isbn=0-231-10298-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

US President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] used the phrase to catch the attention of the national media while reporting on the state of national defense and the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidentprofiles.com/Kennedy-Bush/Lyndon-B-Johnson-Protest-at-home.html#b |title=Protest at home - Lyndon B. Johnson - war, domestic |website=Presidentprofiles.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another use of the phrase was British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s statement, in a 1976 speech she gave at a [[Kensington Town Hall, London|Kensington Town Hall]], in which she said, "The Soviets put guns over butter, but we put almost everything over guns."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=102939 Speech at Kensington Town Hall ("Britain Awake"), Margaret Thatcher Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

The song "Guns Before Butter" by [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]] from their 1979 album ''[[Entertainment!]]'' is about this concept.

[[The Prodigy]]'s 1997 album ''[[The Fat of the Land]]'' has the following text on the fold-out booklet: "We have no butter, but I ask you /Would you rather have butter or guns? /Shall we import lard or steel? Let me tell you /Preparedness makes us powerful. /Butter merely makes us fat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Prodigy-The-Fat-Of-The-Land/release/684749 |title=Prodigy* - The Fat Of The Land (CD, Album) |website=Discogs.com |date=2004-05-31 |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This phrase as the title for an episode ("[[Guns Not Butter]]") in season four of the television show ''[[The West Wing]]'' (1999–2006) that focused on the portion of the [[Federal budget (economics)|federal budget]] devoted to [[Aid|foreign aid]].

The concept was also discussed in the 2001 movie [[Baby Boy (film)|Baby Boy]].

The concept is referenced in the title of the song "Gunz n Butter" on ''[[A$AP Rocky]]'''s 2018 album ''[[TESTING]]''.

==The Great Society example==
[[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]] programs in the 1960s, when he was President of the United States, are examples of the guns versus butter model. While Johnson wanted to continue [[New Deal]] programs and expand welfare with his own Great Society programs, he was also involved in both the [[arms race]] of the [[Cold War]] and in the [[Vietnam War]]. These wars put strains on the economy and hampered his Great Society programs.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

This is in stark contrast to President [[Dwight D Eisenhower]]'s own objections to the expansion and endless warfare of the [[military industrial complex|military-industrial complex]]. In his [[Chance for Peace speech|"Chance For Peace" speech]] in 1953, he referred to this very [[trade-off]], giving specific examples:&lt;blockquote&gt;Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement. We pay for a single fighter plane with a half million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This is, I repeat, the best way of life to be found on the road the world has been taking. This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron. ... Is there no other way the world may live?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The distinction between '''horror and terror''' is a standard literary and psychological concept applied especially to [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] and [[horror fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;Radcliffe 1826; Varma 1966; Crawford 1986: 101-3; Bruhm 1994: 37; Wright 2007: 35-56.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Terror'' is usually described as the feeling of dread and anticipation that ''precedes'' the horrifying experience. By contrast, ''horror'' is the feeling of revulsion that usually ''follows'' a frightening sight, sound, or otherwise experience. It is the feeling one gets after coming to an awful realisation or experiencing a deeply unpleasant occurrence. In other words, horror is more related to being shocked or scared (being horrified), while terror is more related to being anxious or fearful.&lt;ref&gt;Varma 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; Horror has also been defined as a combination of terror and revulsion.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between terror and horror was first characterized by the [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] writer [[Ann Radcliffe]] (1764&amp;ndash;1823). Terror is characterized by "obscurity" or indeterminacy in its treatment of potentially horrible events; it is this indeterminacy which leads to the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. She says in the essay that it "expands the soul and awakens the faculties to a high degree of life". Horror, in contrast, "freezes and nearly annihilates them" with its unambiguous displays of atrocity. She goes on: "I apprehend that neither [[Shakespeare]] nor [[John Milton|Milton]] by their fictions, nor [[Edmund Burke|Mr Burke]] by [[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful|his reasoning]], anywhere looked to positive horror as a source of the sublime, though they all agree that terror is a very high one; and where lies the great difference between horror and terror, but in uncertainty and obscurity, that accompany the first, respecting the dreader evil."&lt;ref&gt;Radcliffe: 1826.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Devendra Varma]] in ''The Gothic Flame'' (1966):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The difference between Terror and Horror is the difference between awful apprehension and sickening realization: between the smell of death and stumbling against a corpse.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Horror is also a genre of [[Horror film|film]] and [[Horror fiction|fiction]] that relies on horrifying images or situations to tell stories and prompt reactions in their audiences. In these films the moment of horrifying revelation is usually preceded by a terrifying build up, often using the medium of scary music.&lt;ref&gt;Wisker 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his non-fiction book ''[[Danse Macabre (book)|Danse Macabre]]'', [[Stephen King]] elaborated on the themes of terror and horror, also adding a third element which he referred to as "revulsion". He describes terror as "the finest element" of the three, and the one he strives hardest to maintain in his own writing. Citing many examples, he defines "terror" as the suspenseful moment in horror before the actual monster is revealed. "Horror," King writes, is that moment at which one sees the creature/aberration that causes the terror or suspense, a "shock value". King finally compares "revulsion" with the gag-reflex, a bottom-level, cheap gimmick which he admits he often resorts to in his own fiction if necessary, confessing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I recognize terror as the finest emotion and so I will try to terrorize the reader. But if I find that I cannot terrify, I will try to horrify, and if I find that I cannot horrify, I'll go for the gross-out. I'm not proud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/show/17240|title=A quote by Stephen King|website=www.goodreads.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Angels Dancing (4804258345).jpg|thumb|Dancing angels]]
The question "'''How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?'''" (alternatively   ''"How many [[angel]]s can stand on the ''point'' of a [[pin]]?"''&lt;ref name=Bartleby/&gt;) is a [[reductio ad absurdum]] of medieval [[scholasticism]] in general, and its [[angelology]] in particular, as represented by  figures such as [[Duns Scotus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref name="Summa"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, D. J., "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14698b.htm Thomism]", in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is first recorded in the 17th century, in the context of [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]] apologetics.
The question has also been linked to the [[fall of Constantinople]], with the [[imagery]] of scholars debating about [[minutiae]] while the Turks besieged the city.&lt;ref name=TodaysZaman&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213014807/http://www.todayszaman.com/op-ed_how-many-angels-can-dance-on-the-head-of-a-pin-by-mouhanad-halwani-_270236.html|archive-date=2014-12-13|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/op-ed_how-many-angels-can-dance-on-the-head-of-a-pin-by-mouhanad-halwani-_270236.html|title=How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?|publisher=Today's Zaman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ramirez&gt;{{Cite book|title = Las Andanzas Del Diablo: Confidencias de un Abogado Ingenuo|last = Ramírez|first = José A.|publisher = Editorial Planeta|year = 1975|isbn = 9788432053375|location = |pages = 58|url = https://books.google.com/?id=oHQnr2oRRocC&amp;q=%22sexo+de+los+angeles%22+alfiler&amp;dq=%22sexo+de+los+angeles%22+alfiler&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=29e_VKfnHMvLygOFp4CwCg&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In modern usage, it therefore has been used as a [[metaphor]] for wasting time debating topics of no practical value, or questions whose answers hold no intellectual consequence, while more urgent concerns pile up.&lt;ref name=Bartleby&gt;{{cite book  | title=The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy  | editor= Hirsch, E. D. Jr. |editor2=Kett, Joseph F. |editor3=Trefil, James | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co |date=2002 |edition=Third  | url=http://www.bartleby.com/59/4/howmanyangel.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030703094956/http://www.bartleby.com/59/4/howmanyangel.html | archivedate = 3 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TodaysZaman/&gt;

==Origin==
Aquinas's ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', written c. 1270, includes discussion of several questions regarding angels such as, "Can several angels be in the same place?"&lt;ref name="Summa"&gt;{{Citation | title = Summa | publisher = New advent | url = http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1052.htm#article3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  
However the idea that such questions had a prominent place in medieval scholarship has been debated, and it has not been proved that this particular question was ever disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Asselt|first= Willem J | author-link = Willem van Asselt |title= Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism | year= 2011|page= 65}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
One theory is that it is an [[early modern]] fabrication,{{Efn | More precisely, in play in the 17th century, and discussed at various levels by the [[Cambridge Platonists]] Cudworth and [[Henry More]], and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]].}} as used to discredit scholastic philosophy at a time when it still played a significant role in university education. [[James Franklin (philosopher)|James Franklin]] has raised the scholarly issue, and mentions that there is a 17th-century reference in [[William Chillingworth]]'s ''Religion of Protestants'' (1637),&lt;ref&gt;Franklin 1993 p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; where he accuses unnamed scholastics of debating "whether a Million of Angels may not fit upon a Needle's point?&lt;!--original capitalization; see MOS:QUOTE--&gt;"
This is earlier than a reference in the 1678 ''The True Intellectual System Of The Universe'' by [[Ralph Cudworth]]. HS Lang, author of ''Aristotle's Physics and its Medieval Varieties'' (1992), says (p.&amp;nbsp;284):

{{quote|The question of how many angels can dance on the point of a [[Sewing needle|needle]], or the head of a pin, is often attributed to 'late medieval writers'...  In point of fact, the question has never been found in this form…}}

[[Peter Harrison (historian)|Peter Harrison]] (2016) has suggested that the first reference to angels dancing on a needle's point occurs in an expository work by the English divine, William Sclater (1575-1626). 
In ''An exposition with notes vpon the first Epistle to the Thessalonians'' (1619), Sclater claimed that scholastic philosophers occupied themselves with such pointless questions as whether angels "did occupie a place; and so, whether many might be in one place at one time; and how many might sit on a Needles point; and six hundred such like needlesse points." 
Harrison proposes that the reason an English writer first introduced the "needle’s point" into a critique of medieval angelology is that it makes for a clever pun on "needless point".&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Harrison (historian)|Peter Harrison]], [http://nq.oxfordjournals.org/content/63/1/45.full.pdf+html "Angels on Pinheads and Needles’ Points"], ''Notes and Queries'', 63 (2016), 45-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter written to ''[[The Times]]'' in 1975&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sylla |first1=E. D. |year=2005 |chapter=Swester Katrei and Gregory of Rimini: Angels, God, and Mathematics in the Fourteenth Century |editor1-last=Koetsier |editor1-first=S. |editor2-last=Bergmans |title=Mathematics and the Divine: A Historical Study |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AMOQZfrZq-EC&amp;pg=PA251&amp;dq=%22heaven+a+thousand+angels+can+stand%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjv-eLW_ffXAhWBYlAKHewrBasQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22heaven%20a%20thousand%20angels%20can%20stand%22&amp;f=false |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Elsevier |page=251 |isbn=0444503285 |access-date=7 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; identified a close parallel in a 14th-century [[mystical]] text, the ''[[Swester Katrei]]'':

{{quote|[D]octors declare that in heaven a thousand angels can stand on the point of a needle.  Now [[wikt:rede#Verb|rede]] me the meaning of this.}}

Other possibilities are that it is a surviving parody or self-parody, or a training topic in debating.

In Italian,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dizionari.corriere.it/dizionario-modi-di-dire/A/angelo.shtml|title=Angelo - Dizionario dei modi di dire - Corriere.it|website=dizionari.corriere.it|language=it|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish and Portuguese, the conundrum of useless scholarly debates is linked to a similar question of [[Sexuality in Christian demonology|whether angels are sexless or have a sex]].&lt;ref name=Ramirez/&gt; 
Spanish [[jurist]] [[José Antonio Ramírez López]] (1908–1987) said about the story of the Byzantine empire: ''"Everybody knows the idiotic and sometimes bloody discussions in that Empire on the sex of angels, about how many could perch at the same time on the head of a pin"''.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

==Modern references==
[[Dorothy L. Sayers]] argued that the question was "simply a debating exercise" and that the answer "usually adjudged correct" was stated as, "Angels are pure intelligences, not material, but limited, so that they have location in space, but not extension."&lt;ref name="DSLTL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gbt.org/text/sayers.html |title=The Lost Tools of Learning |first=Dorothy L |last=Sayers |authorlink=Dorothy L. Sayers|publisher=Gbt.org|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sayers compares the question to that of how many people's thoughts can be concentrated upon a particular pin at the same time. She concludes that [[infinitely]] many angels can be located on the head of a pin, since they do not occupy any space there:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The practical lesson to be drawn from the argument is not to use words like "there" in a loose, unscientific way, without specifying whether you mean "located there" or "occupying space there."&lt;ref name="DSLTL" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the humoristic magazine ''[[Annals of Improbable Research]]'', [[Anders Sandberg]] has presented a calculation based on theories of [[information physics]] and [[quantum gravity]], establishing an upper bound of 8.6766×10&lt;sup&gt;49&lt;/sup&gt; angels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume7/v7i3/angels-7-3.htm |title=Quantum Gravity Treatment of the Angel Density Problem|publisher=Annals of Improbable Research |date=2001 |accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Comparing medieval superstition and modern science, [[George Bernard Shaw]] wrote in the introduction to the play ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'' that "The medieval doctors of divinity who did not pretend to settle how many angels could dance on the point of a needle cut a very poor figure as far as romantic credulity is concerned beside the modern physicists who have settled to the billionth of a millimetre every movement and position in the dance of the electrons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks02/0200811h.html |title= Saint Joan – A Chronicle Play in Six Scenes and an Epilogue |date= |accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the satirical novel ''[[Good Omens]]'' by [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Terry Pratchett]], the angel Aziraphale is said to be the only angel who could dance on the head of a pin, as he learned the [[gavotte]] in the 19th century. Also, in ''[[Carpe Jugulum]]'' by Terry Pratchett, Granny Weatherwax says the answer is 16 if it's an ordinary house pin.

''Weather Report Suite Part II: Let It Grow'', a song from the 1973 [[Grateful Dead]] album [[Wake of the Flood]], includes the line "As well to count the angels dancing on a pin."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dead.net/song/weather-report-suite-part-ii-let-it-grow&lt;/ref&gt;

In the comic book ''[[The Crow]]'' by [[James O'Barr]], the main character asks this question to one of his victims before killing them, answering himself, "Depends on the tune".

The song ''Velodrome'' from [[Minnesota]] rapper [[Dessa]]'s 2018 album [[Chime (Dessa album)|Chime]], references this question in the first verse asking, "Aquinas, call on me/ How many angels on the/ Head of your pin?"
&lt;!--{{trivia}}
In his novel ''[[Jitterbug Perfume]]'', [[Tom Robbins]] suggests: "Philosophers have argued for centuries about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, but materialists have known all along that it depends on whether they are jitterbugging or dancing cheek to cheek".

The comic ''[[Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal]]'' poses an answer derived from physics to this question, i.e. between one and 30 [[vigintillion]] angels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&amp;id=2576 |title=Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal |publisher=Smbc-comics.com |date= |accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comic [[Dilbert]] lets the character [[Dogbert]] share the final answer. It's six.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dilbert.com/strip/1991-06-18|title=Dilbert Comic Strip on 1991-06-18 {{!}} Dilbert by Scott Adams|website=Dilbert|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventh episode of the fifth season of the science-fiction series ''[[Babylon 5]]'', the recurring character Byron Gordon, in a conversation about a rebellion among Human Telepaths against a despotic government, both asked and answered the question with a confident but cryptic: "As many as want to." Thus suggesting the specific number of angels is irrelevant, it is the existence of angels (and by way of analogy the Telepaths and allies that follow of the message of freedom and peace against tyranny) that is important.

{{cite bailii|litigants='''Hughes v Lord Advocate'''|year=1963|court=UKHL|num=31}} is an important Scottish [[Scots delict|delict]] case decided by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] on [[Causation (law)|causation]]. The case is also influential in [[negligence]] in the [[English law of tort]] (even though [[English law]] does not recognise "[[allurement]]" ''per se'').

The case's main significance is that, after the shift within the [[common law]] of [[English law of negligence|negligence]] from [[strict liability]]&lt;ref&gt;As in ''[[Re Polemis]]''&lt;/ref&gt; to a reasonable standard of care,&lt;ref&gt;As in [[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' and  ''[[Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd|The Wagon Mound]]''&lt;/ref&gt; this case advocated a middle way, namely: 
*Even if the loss or harm is not itself foreseeable, liability may arise provided the actual loss falls with a "foreseeable class of harm". 
This idea was neither developed nor expanded upon, and only one year later the claimant in ''[[Doughty v Turner Manufacturing]]'' obtained no remedy ''via'' this "middle way".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-lawresources.co.uk/Doughty-v-Turner-Manufacturing-Company.php ''Doughty v Turner Manufacturing Company'' case report]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doughty v Turner Manufacturing Company [1964] 1 QB 518&lt;/ref&gt; However, the case was followed in subsequent cases on [[occupiers' liability]].

==Facts==
One evening in November 1958 two boys aged 8 and 10&lt;ref&gt;The older boy was the younger boy's uncle.&lt;/ref&gt; were walking down Russell Road, [[Edinburgh]] where some [[Post Office]] workers were repairing cables under the street. The men had opened a manhole and had erected a weather tent over it, with an access ladder inside. From mid-afternoon onwards, the tent had four red paraffin warning lamps. The workmen left around 5pm for a tea break nearby; before leaving, they withdrew the ladder, leaving it outside the tent.

While the workmen were out, the boys arrived and started meddling with the equipment. They picked up one of the lamps and entered the tent. They took the ladder and proceeded to explore the manhole, after which they safely climbed out again. The younger boy tripped over the lamp, which fell into the manhole and broke. The paraffin leaked and vaporised, causing an explosion with flames reaching up to thirty feet. The impact of the blast caused the 8-year old to fall into the hole and suffer severe burn injuries.

The question arose whether the Post Office workers had been negligent in leaving the site  unattended with the lamps burning. Under Scots law, they owed a duty of reasonable care to prevent the  site becoming an "allurement" for the boys; had they discharged this duty? On the other hand, the children were trespasser and possibly contributorily negligence. A crucial issue was the likelihood (or foreseeability) of the presence of children on Russell Road, and whether the explosion causing the serious burn injuries  was of "different type than that could have been foreseeable".

The court of first instance, the [[First Division of the Court of Session]], limited the liability of the Post Office on the grounds that although the danger to children was foreseeable the accident itself was not foreseeable. The defence had argued that the boys were not only [[trespass]]ers but also [[contributory negligence|contributorily negligeny]], but the court responded that the Post Office did not have any exclusive interest in the middle of the road to support a claim of trespass; and taking into consideration the youth of the boy, it was agreed that he was NOT contributorily negligence; and these points were dropped on appeal to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]).

==Judgment on appeal==
[[David Jenkins, Baron Jenkins|Lord Jenkins]] addressed the duty of issue of care established by [[Lord Atkin]] in ''[[Donoghue v. Stevenson]],'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Donoghue v. Stevenson]]'' [1932] AC 562]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''Donoghue v. Stevenson'' Lord Atkin had declared that you take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour."&lt;/ref&gt; saying:  "the Post Office had brought on the public highway apparatus capable of constituting a source of danger to passer-by ... It was therefore their duty that such passerby, "neighbour" in the language of ''Donoghue v. Stevenson'', were, so far as reasonably practicable, protected from the various obstacles or allurements, which the workmen had brought to the site. It is clear that the safety precautions taken by the Post Office did not in this instance measure up to Lord Atkin's test."

[[John Morris, Baron Morris of Borth-y-Gest|Lord Morris]] stated that "exercising an ordinary, and certainly not an over-exacting, degree of prevention the workmen should have decided, when the tea-break came, that someone had better be left in charge who could repel the intrusion of inquisitive children," thereby casting doubt that the workers had discharged their duty of care.

In both the First Division and in the House of Lords, the defence argued that it was unforeseeable that children might be on Russell Road, "a quiet road, some four hundred yards away from any houses". Lord Morris opined (following the judgement of Lord Ordinary) that "if, of, course, there was no likelihood that children might appear, different considerations would apply. But children did appear, and I find no reason to differ from the conclusion of the Lord Ordinary that the presence of children in the immediate vicinity of the shelter was reasonably to be anticipated."

[[Christopher Guest, Baron Guest|Lord Guest]] declared that the burden of proof that the presence of children lay with the respondent; and on the facts there was insufficient evidence to do this. Lord Guest accepted that it was reasonable to anticipate the danger that might arise by meddling children, and that that, "... the normal dangers of such children falling into the manhole and injured by a lamp were such that a reasonable man would not have ignored them."

It was accepted that the explosion causing the burns was a result of paraffin leaking from the lamp. According to Lord Reid, the boy's injuries from burns was foreseeable. Although the extent of the injury of burn was greater than might have been expected, this was no defence. However, if the injury were of a different kind than the foreseeable type the defender might have escaped liability.

[[James Reid, Baron Reid|Lord Reid]] continued that as the cause of the accident &amp;ndash; the explosion from paraffin lamp &amp;ndash; was known, it left no scope to allege the accident was caused from some unknown source, rather than the fault of respondent. Lord Reid concluded that the accident in question "was but a variant of foreseeable" and it mattered not it may have arisen in an unforeseeable manner.

Lord Jenkins agreed, finding no justification to hold someone liable if the accident had occurred from the burning of lamp but not if the lamp had exploded.

[[John Morris, Baron Morris of Borth-y-Gest|Lord Morris]] agreed, saying that the injury suffered by the boy was of a higher degree, but was "of the kind or type of accident which was foreseeable". He said the respondent "should not escape liability just because they could not foresee the exact way" in which the boy might play with the equipment, or the way in which he might get hurt. Allowing the appeal, Lord Morris said there was a duty owed by the respondent to safeguard the boy against the type or kind of occurrence which in fact happened and which resulted in his injuries, and the defenders are not absolved from liability because they didn't envisage "the precise concatenation of circumstances which lead up to the accident."

Lord Guest pointed out that for making a coherent chain of causation it is not necessary to follow the minute details leading up to the accident to be reasonably foreseeable, but only that "the type of accident caused was of a foreseeable type". He was of the view that the lower courts wrongly gave more emphasis on the fact on explosion; to Lord Guest it was a non-essential element. He gave more emphasis on the fact whether burning of paraffin outside the lamp was a reasonable foreseeable event. The lower courts had already concluded these events as a reasonable foreseeable event, but they were of the view the explosion was an unforeseeable event. Lord Guest argued this as a "fallacious" claim. Lord Guest concluded that the accident and the injuries sustained by the boys should have been reasonably foreseen by Post Office employees, who were in breach of duty to take adequate protection against the accident.

[[Lord Pearce]] cited the case of ''[[Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd|The Wagon Mound]]'' which held that a person is not liable if the accident is of a different type than the type which was foreseen by the person. It would be unjust to check each and every details of the foreseeability test too minutely when the case deals with things that can be allurement to children leads to an accident and hard to foresee the exact way in which the accident may take place.

In sum, all the judges allowed the boy's appeal. The decision was followed in ''[[Jolley v Sutton London Borough Council]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jolley v Sutton London Borough Council]]'' [2000] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/31.html 1 WLR 1082]&lt;/ref&gt;

(For a similar case arising under [[US law]], see ''[[Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co.|Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co.]]'' 248 N.Y. 339, 162 [[North Eastern Reporter|N.E.]] 99 (1928)&lt;/ref&gt; a case which had been influential upon the court in ''Donoghue v Stevenson'').

[[Image:st anne mosaic.jpg|thumb|right|La Scapigliata in Carnelian, with close-up of mouth. ([[Roy Feinson]])]]
Unlike traditional [[mosaics]] which rely on differently colored material arranged in arbitrary configurations to make an image, '''impressionist mosaics''' are created using the natural flaws and marbling in the tiles to create the impression of an image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.mozaico.com/impressionism-mosaic-art/ | title=Impressionist Mosaics: Portraying a Perceptual Impression | publisher=Mozaico | date=14 August 2015 | accessdate=24 November 2015 | author=Menhem, Chantal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the definition, this may be limited to arranging square, homogeneously colored tiles in a grid-like, non-overlapped fashion.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Using stones that are of relatively uniform color and texture (typically pre-cut natural [[gemstones]] such as jasper, marble, or amethyst), the resulting mosaics have a uniquely ethereal quality that distinguishes them from traditional processes. Since the technique uses uniformly cut stones, it does not require [[grouting]]. 

==Process==
By [[Roy Feinson]]'s definition, impressionist mosaics are created by taking dozens of measurements of every tile in the artist's "palette".  The measurements are obtained by digitally photographing each tile and separating it into a grid of sixteen equal sections and analyzing each section for color, contrast and marbling. The resultant data are stored in a [[database]] and operated on by proprietary software, which recommends placements for all the tiles. Since the tiles are generally square, the software considers all four possible rotations for each tile, which greatly increases the odds that a given tile will find a good 'home'.  Each tile is equivalent to sixteen pixels in the final mosaic since its final location is a function of sixteen sections. While the software is an important component of this process, the artist must still rely on traditional hand-eye techniques to complete the image.
Care must be taken to balance the color curves in the target image to that of the component tiles. For example, if the darkest color to be found on any of the component tiles is only a mid-tone gray, then any blacks in the target image's must be converted to mid-tone gray.  This process would be repeated for the reds, greens, blues, and whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://royfeinson.com/mozaicartz/home/ | title=Impressionist Mosaics | publisher=Roy Feinson | accessdate=24 November 2015 | author=Feinson, Roy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from traditional mosaics==
Traditional mosaics have a history dating back to at least the fourth century BC, and employ a variety of methodologies to create their images. However, traditional mosaics share the common feature of employing small, uniformly colored materials ([[tesserae]]) to create a pattern or picture. Because the tiles can be cut into irregular shapes to conform to the base pattern, mosaisists are able to create works of astonishing detail and color. 
 
Alternatively, pixel tile mosaics, such as those found on the floor of the [[University of Toronto]] pool, employ standard sized tiles (generally 1 x 1 or 2 by 2 inch) in a variety of colors arranged in a uniform matrix.   Each tile is a different color and represents a single 'pixel' in the final image. The resulting mosaic is typically coarse and of very low resolution.

==History==
Pioneering work in this field was conducted in the 1990s by California mosaic artist [[Roy Feinson]], who because of its underlying similarities to 19th century [[impressionism]] coined the term Impressionist Mosaics.

In 2006, mosaic artists Nick Berg and Alan Roth made custom mosaics using this technique commercially available in marble and wood. Because of the increased image resolution inherent in the impressionist mosaic process, they coined the terms High Definition Mosaics and Photo-realistic Mosaics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30537">'''Intuitionistic type theory''' (also known as '''constructive type theory''', or '''Martin-Löf type theory''') is a [[type theory]] and an alternative [[Foundations of mathematics|foundation of mathematics]].
Intuitionistic type theory was created by [[Per Martin-Löf]], a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[mathematician]] and [[philosopher]], who first published it in 1972.  There are multiple versions of the type theory:  Martin-Löf proposed both [[Intensional logic|intensional]] and [[extensionality|extensional]] variants of the theory and early [[impredicative]] versions, shown to be inconsistent by [[Girard's paradox]], gave way to [[Predicativity|predicative]] versions. However, all versions keep the core design of constructive logic using dependent types.  

==Design==

Martin-Löf designed the type theory on the principles of [[mathematical constructivism]].  Constructivism requires any existence proof to contain a "witness".  So, any proof of "there exists a prime greater than 1000" must identify a specific number that is both prime and greater than 1000.  Intuitionistic type theory accomplished this design goal by internalizing the [[BHK interpretation]].  An interesting consequence is that proofs become mathematical objects that can be examined, compared, and manipulated.

Intuitionistic type theory's type constructors were built to follow a one-to-one correspondence with logical connectives.  For example, the logical connective called implication (&lt;math&gt;A \implies B&lt;/math&gt;) corresponds to the type of a function (&lt;math&gt;A \to B&lt;/math&gt;). This correspondence is called the [[Curry–Howard isomorphism]].  Previous type theories had also followed this isomorphism, but Martin-Löf's was the first to extend it to [[predicate logic]] by introducing [[dependent types]].

==Type theory==
Intuitionistic type theory has 3 finite types, which are then composed using 5 different type constructors.  Unlike set theories, type theories are not built on top of a logic like [[First-order logic|Frege's]].  So, each feature of the type theory does double duty as a feature of both math and logic.

''If you are unfamiliar with type theory and know set theory, a quick summary is: Types contain terms just like sets contain elements.  Terms belong to one and only one type.  Terms like &lt;math&gt;2+2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2\cdot 2&lt;/math&gt; compute ("reduce") down to canonical terms like 4.  For more, see the article on [[Type theory]].''

===0 type, 1 type and 2 type ===

There are 3 finite types:  The '''0''' type contains 0 terms.  The '''1''' type contains 1 canonical term.  And the '''2''' type contains 2 canonical terms.

Because the '''0''' type contains 0 terms, it is also called the [[empty type]].  It is used to represent anything that cannot exist.  It is also written &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; and represents anything unprovable.  (That is, a proof of it cannot exist.)  As a result, [[negation]] is defined as a function to it: &lt;math&gt;\neg A := A \to \bot&lt;/math&gt;.

Likewise, the '''1''' type contains 1 canonical term and represents existence.  It also is called the [[unit type]].  It often represents propositions that can be proven and is, therefore, sometimes written &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt;.  

Finally, the '''2''' type contains 2 canonical terms.  It represents a definite choice between two values.  It is used for [[Boolean Algebra|Boolean values]] but ''not'' propositions.  Propositions may be proven (the '''1''' type), may be proven to never have a proof (the '''0''' type), or may not be proven either way.  (The [[Law of excluded middle|Law of Excluded Middle]] does not hold for propositions in intuitionistic type theory.)

===Σ type constructor===

Σ-types contain ordered pairs. As with typical ordered pair (or 2-tuple) types, a Σ-type can describe the [[Cartesian product|cartesian product]], &lt;math&gt;A \times B&lt;/math&gt;, of two other types, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. Logically, such an ordered pair would hold a proof of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and a proof of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, so one may see such a type written as &lt;math&gt;A \wedge B&lt;/math&gt;.

Σ-types are more powerful than typical ordered pair types because of [[Dependent type|dependent typing]]. In the ordered pair, the type of the second term can depend on the value of the first term.  For example, the first term of the pair might be a natural number and the second term's type might be a vector of length equal to the first term. Such a type would be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n \mathbin{:} {\mathbb N}} \operatorname{Vec}({\mathbb R}, n)&lt;/math&gt;

Using set-theory terminology, this is similar to an indexed [[disjoint union]]s of sets. In the case of usual ordered pairs, the type of the second term does not depend on the value of the first term. Thus the type describing the cartesian product &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb N} \times {\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt; is written:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n \mathbin{:} {\mathbb N}} {\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to note here that the value of the first term, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, is not depended on by the type of the second term, &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt;.

Obviously, Σ-types can be used to build up longer dependently-typed [[tuple]]s used in mathematics and the [[Record (computer science)|records or structs]] used in most programming languages.  An example of a dependently-typed 3-tuple is two integers and a proof that the first integer is smaller than the second integer, described by the type:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m \mathbin{:} {\mathbb I}} {\sum_{n \mathbin{:} {\mathbb I}} ((m &lt; n) = \text{True})}&lt;/math&gt;

Dependent typing allows Σ-types to serve the role of existential quantifier.  The statement "there exists an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; is proven" becomes the type of ordered pairs where the first item is the value &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; and the second item is a proof of &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt;.  Notice that the type of the second item (proofs of &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt;) depends on the value in the first part of the ordered pair (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;). Its type would be: 

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n \mathbin{:} {\mathbb N}} P(n)&lt;/math&gt;

===Π type constructor===

Π-types contain functions. As with typical function types, they consist of an input type and an output type. They are more powerful than typical function types however, in that the return type can depend on the input value. Functions in type theory are different from set theory.  In set theory, you look up the argument's value in a set of ordered pairs.  In type theory, the argument is substituted into a term and then computation ("reduction") is applied to the term. 
  
As an example, the type of a function that, given a natural number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, returns a vector containing &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; real numbers is written:

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{n \mathbin{:} {\mathbb N}} \operatorname{Vec}({\mathbb R}, n)&lt;/math&gt;

When the output type does not depend on the input value, the function type is often simply written with a &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb N} \to {\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt; is the type of functions from natural numbers to real numbers. Such Π-types correspond to logical implication. The logical proposition &lt;math&gt;A \implies B&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the type &lt;math&gt;A \to B&lt;/math&gt;, containing functions that take proofs-of-A and return proofs-of-B. This type could be written more consistently as:

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{a \mathbin{:} A} B&lt;/math&gt;

Π-types are also used in logic for universal quantification.  The statement "for every &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; is proven" becomes a function from &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; to proofs of &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, given the value for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; the function generates a proof that &lt;math&gt;P()&lt;/math&gt; holds for that value. The type would be 

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{n \mathbin{:} {\mathbb N}} P(n)&lt;/math&gt;

=== = type constructor ===
=-types are created from two terms.  Given two terms like &lt;math&gt;2+2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2 \cdot 2&lt;/math&gt;, you can create a new type &lt;math&gt;2+2=2\cdot 2&lt;/math&gt;.   The terms of that new type represent proofs that the pair reduce to the same canonical term.  Thus, since both &lt;math&gt;2+2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2\cdot 2&lt;/math&gt; compute to the canonical term &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt;, there will be a term of the type &lt;math&gt;2+2=2\cdot 2&lt;/math&gt;.  In intuitionistic type theory, there is a single way to make terms of =-types and that is by [[Reflexive relation|reflexivity]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{refl} \mathbin{:} \prod_{a \mathbin{:} A} (a = a).&lt;/math&gt;

It is possible to create =-types such as &lt;math&gt;1=2&lt;/math&gt; where the terms do not reduce to the same canonical term, but you will be unable to create terms of that new type.  In fact, if you were able to create a term of &lt;math&gt;1=2&lt;/math&gt;, you could create a term of &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt;.  Putting that into a function would generating a function of type &lt;math&gt;1=2 \implies \bot&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\ldots \implies \bot&lt;/math&gt; is how intuitionistic type theory defines negation, you would have &lt;math&gt;\neg (1=2)&lt;/math&gt; or, finally, &lt;math&gt;1 \neq 2&lt;/math&gt;.

Equality of proofs is an area of active research in [[Proof theory|proof theory]] and has led to the development of [[homotopy type theory]] and other type theories.

===Inductive types===
{{Main|Inductive type}}

Inductive types allow the creation of complex, self-referential types.  For example, a linked list of natural numbers is either an empty list or a pair of a natural number and another linked list.  Inductive types can be used to define unbounded mathematical structures like trees, graphs, etc..  In fact, the natural numbers type may be defined as an inductive type, either being &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; or the [[Successor function|successor]] of another natural number.   

Inductive types define new constants, such as zero &lt;math&gt;0 \mathbin{:} {\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; and the successor function &lt;math&gt;S \mathbin{:} {\mathbb N} \to {\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;.  Since &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; does not have a definition and cannot be evaluated using substitution, terms like &lt;math&gt;S 0&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;S S S 0&lt;/math&gt; become the canonical terms of the natural numbers.  

Proofs on inductive types are made possible by [[Induction, Mathematical|induction]].  Each new inductive type comes with its own inductive rule.  To prove a predicate &lt;math&gt;P()&lt;/math&gt; for every natural number, you use the following rule:

:&lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{{\mathbb N}-elim}}\, \mathbin{:} P(0)\, \to \left(\prod_{n \mathbin{:} {\mathbb N}} P(n) \to P(S(n))\right) \to \prod_{n \mathbin{:} {\mathbb N}} P(n)&lt;/math&gt;

Inductive types in intuitionistic type theory are defined in terms of W-types, the type of [[well-founded]] trees.  Later work in type theory generated coinductive types, induction-recursion, and induction-induction for working on types with more obscure kinds of self-referentiality.  [[Higher inductive type|Higher inductive types]] allow equality to be defined between terms.

===Universe types===
The universe types allow proofs to be written about all the types created with the other type constructors.  Every term in the universe type &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_0&lt;/math&gt; can be mapped to a type created with any combination of &lt;math&gt;0,1,2,\Sigma,\Pi,=,&lt;/math&gt; and the inductive type constructor.  However, to avoid paradoxes, there is no term in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_0&lt;/math&gt; that maps to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_0&lt;/math&gt;.  

To write proofs about all "the small types" and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_0&lt;/math&gt;, you must use &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1&lt;/math&gt;, which does contain a term for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_0&lt;/math&gt;, but not for itself &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_2&lt;/math&gt;.  There is a [[Impredicativity|predicative]] hierarchy of universes, so to quantify a proof over any fixed constant &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; universes, you can use &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Universe types are a tricky feature of type theories.  Martin-Löf's original type theory had to be changed to account for [[Girard's paradox]].  Later research covered topics such as "super universes", "Mahlo universes", and impredicative universes.

==Judgements==
The formal definition of intuitionistic type theory is written using judgements.  For example, in the statement "if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a type and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a type then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{a:A} B&lt;/math&gt; is a type" there are judgements of "is a type", "and", and "if ... then ...".  The expression &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{a:A} B&lt;/math&gt; is not a judgement; it is the type being defined.  

This second level of the type theory can be confusing, particularly where it comes to equality.    There is a judgement of term equality, which might say &lt;math&gt;4=2+2&lt;/math&gt;.  It is a statement that two terms reduce to the same canonical term.  There is also a judgement of type equality, say that &lt;math&gt;A=B&lt;/math&gt;, which means every element of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an element of the type &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and vice versa.  At the type level, there is a type &lt;math&gt;4=2+2&lt;/math&gt; and it contains terms if there is a proof that &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2+2&lt;/math&gt; reduce to the same value.  (Obviously, terms of this type are generated using the term-equality judgement.)   Lastly, there is an English-language level of equality, because we use the word "four" and symbol "&lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt;" to refer to the canonical term &lt;math&gt;S S S S 0&lt;/math&gt;.  Synonyms like these are called "definitionally equal" by Martin-Löf.

The description of judgements below is based on the discussion in Nordström, Petersson, and Smith.
 
The formal theory works with ''types'' and ''objects''.

A type is declared by:
* &lt;math&gt;A\ \mathsf{Type}&lt;/math&gt;
An object exists and is in a type if:
* &lt;math&gt;a \mathbin{:} A &lt;/math&gt;
Objects can be equal
* &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt;
and types can be equal
* &lt;math&gt;A = B&lt;/math&gt;
A type that depends on an object from another type is declared
* &lt;math&gt; (x \mathbin{:} A)B&lt;/math&gt;
and removed by substitution
* &lt;math&gt; B[x / a] &lt;/math&gt;, replacing the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with the object &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.
An object that depends on an object from another type can be done two ways.
If the object is "abstracted", then it is written
* &lt;math&gt;[x]b&lt;/math&gt;
and removed by substitution
* &lt;math&gt; b[x / a] &lt;/math&gt;, replacing the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with the object &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.
The object-depending-on-object can also be declared as a constant as part of a recursive type. An example of a recursive type is:
* &lt;math&gt;0 \mathbin{:} \mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;S \mathbin{:} \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt;
Here, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a constant object-depending-on-object.  It is not associated with an abstraction.
Constants like &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; can be removed by defining equality.  Here the relationship with addition is defined using equality and using pattern matching to handle the recursive aspect of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
    \operatorname{add} &amp;\mathbin{:}\ (\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}) \to \mathbb{N} \\
    \operatorname{add}(0, b) &amp;= b \\
    \operatorname{add}(S(a), b) &amp;= S(\operatorname{add}(a, b)))
  \end{align}
  &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is manipulated as an opaque constant - it has no internal structure for substitution.

So, objects and types and these relations are used to express formulae in the theory.  The following styles of judgements are used to create new objects, types and relations from existing ones:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash \sigma\ \mathsf{Type}&lt;/math&gt;
| ''σ'' is a well-formed type in the context Γ.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash t \mathbin{:} \sigma&lt;/math&gt;
| ''t'' is a well-formed term of type ''σ'' in context Γ.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash \sigma \equiv \tau&lt;/math&gt;
| ''σ'' and ''τ'' are equal types in context Γ.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash t \equiv u \mathbin{:} \sigma&lt;/math&gt;
| ''t'' and ''u'' are judgmentally equal terms of type ''σ'' in context Γ.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Gamma\ \mathsf{Context}&lt;/math&gt;
| Γ is a well-formed context of typing assumptions.
|}

By convention, there is a type that represents all other types.  It is called &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Set}&lt;/math&gt;).  Since &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; is a type, the member of it are objects.  There is a dependent type &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{El}&lt;/math&gt; that maps each object to its corresponding type.  ''In most texts &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{El}&lt;/math&gt; is never written.''  From the context of the statement, a reader can almost always tell whether &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; refers to a type, or whether it refers to the object in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; that corresponds to the type.

This is the complete foundation of the theory.  Everything else is derived.

To implement logic, each proposition is given its own type.  The objects in those types represent the different possible ways to prove the proposition.  Obviously, if there is no proof for the proposition, then the type has no objects in it.  Operators like "and" and "or" that work on propositions introduce new types and new objects.  So &lt;math&gt;A \times B &lt;/math&gt; is a type that depends on the type &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and the type &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.  The objects in that dependent type are defined to exist for every pair of objects in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.  Obviously, if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; has no proof and is an empty type, then the new type representing &lt;math&gt; A \times B &lt;/math&gt; is also empty.

This can be done for other types (booleans, natural numbers, etc.) and their operators.

==Categorical models of type theory==
Using the language of [[category theory]], [[R.A.G. Seely]] introduced the notion of a [[locally cartesian closed category]] (LCCC) as the basic model of type theory. This has been refined by Hofmann and Dybjer to ''Categories with Families'' or ''Categories with Attributes'' based on earlier work by Cartmell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clairambault|first=Pierre|last2=Dybjer|first2=Peter|date=2014|title=The biequivalence of locally cartesian closed categories and Martin-Löf type theories|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mathematical-structures-in-computer-science/article/biequivalence-of-locally-cartesian-closed-categories-and-martinlof-type-theories/6ECB295B1246A85D5DD92E5F38428D99|journal=Mathematical Structures in Computer Science|language=en|volume=24|issue=6|doi=10.1017/S0960129513000881|issn=0960-1295|arxiv=1112.3456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A category with families is a category ''C'' of contexts (in which the objects are contexts, and
the context morphisms are substitutions), together with a functor ''T'' : ''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; → ''Fam(Set)''.

''Fam(Set)'' is the [[category of families]] of Sets, in which objects are pairs ''(A,B)'' of an "index set" ''A'' and a function ''B'': ''X'' → ''A'', and morphisms are pairs of functions ''f'' : ''A'' → ''A' '' and ''g'' : ''X'' → ''X' '', such that ''B' '' &lt;sub&gt;°&lt;/sub&gt; ''g'' = ''f'' &lt;sub&gt;°&lt;/sub&gt; ''B'' - in other words, ''f'' maps ''B&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''B'&lt;sub&gt;g(a)&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The functor ''T'' assigns to a context ''G'' a set ''Ty(G)'' of types, and for each ''A'' : ''Ty(G)'', a set ''Tm(G,A)'' of terms.
The axioms for a functor require that these play harmoniously with substitution. Substitution is usually
written in the form ''Af'' or ''af'', where ''A'' is a type in ''Ty(G)'' and ''a'' is a term in ''Tm(G,A)'', and ''f'' is a substitution
from ''D'' to ''G''.  Here ''Af'' : ''Ty(D)'' and ''af'' : ''Tm(D,Af)''.

The category ''C'' must contain a terminal object (the empty context), and a final object for a form
of product called comprehension, or context extension, in which the right element is a type in the context of the left element.
If ''G'' is a context, and ''A'' : ''Ty(G)'', then there should be an object ''(G,A)'' final among
contexts ''D'' with mappings ''p'' : ''D → ''G'', ''q'' : ''Tm(D,Ap)''.

A logical framework, such as Martin-Löf's takes the form of
closure conditions on the context dependent sets of types and terms: that there should be a type called
Set, and for each set a type, that the types should be closed under forms of dependent sum and
product, and so forth.

A theory such as that of predicative set theory expresses closure conditions on the types of sets and
their elements: that they should be closed under operations that reflect dependent sum and product,
and under various forms of inductive definition.

==Extensional versus intensional==
A fundamental distinction is [[Extensional definition|extensional]] vs [[Intensional definition|intensional]] type theory. In extensional type theory definitional (i.e., computational) equality is not distinguished from propositional equality, which requires proof. As a consequence type checking becomes [[undecidable problem|undecidable]] in extensional type theory because programs in the theory might not terminate. For example, such a theory allows one to give a type to the [[Fixpoint combinator|Y-combinator]], a detailed example of this can be found in Nordstöm and Petersson "Programming in Martin-Löf's Type Theory".&lt;ref&gt;Bengt Nordström; Kent Petersson; Jan M. Smith (1990). ''Programming in Martin-Löf's Type Theory''. Oxford University Press p.90&lt;/ref&gt; However, this doesn't prevent extensional type theory from being a basis for a practical tool, for example, [[NuPRL]] is based on extensional type theory. From a practical standpoint there's no difference between a program which doesn't terminate and a program which takes a million years to terminate.

In contrast in intensional type theory [[type checking]] is [[Decision problem|decidable]], but the representation of standard mathematical concepts is somewhat more cumbersome, since intensional reasoning requires using [[setoid]]s or similar constructions. There are many common mathematical objects, which are hard to work with or can't be represented without this, for example, [[Integer|integer numbers]], [[rational number]]s, and [[real number]]s. Integers and rational numbers can be represented without setoids, but this representation isn't easy to work with. Real numbers can't be represented without this.&lt;ref&gt;Altenkirch, Thorsten, Thomas Anberrée, and Nuo Li. "Definable Quotients in Type Theory."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Homotopy type theory]] works on resolving this problem. It allows one to define [[higher inductive type]]s, which not only define first order constructors ([[value (computer science)|value]]s or [[point (geometry)|point]]s), but higher order constructors, i.e. equalities between elements ([[path (topology)|path]]s), equalities between equalities ([[homotopy|homotopies]]), ''ad infinitum''.

==Implementations of type theory==
Different forms of type theory have been implemented as the formal systems underlying of a number of [[Proof assistant|proof assistants]]. While many are based off Per Martin-Löf's ideas, many have added features, more axioms, or different philosophical background. For instance, the  [[NuPRL]] system is based on [[computational type theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=S.F.|last2=Bickford|first2=M.|last3=Constable|first3=R.L.|last4=Eaton|first4=R.|last5=Kreitz|first5=C.|last6=Lorigo|first6=L.|last7=Moran|first7=E.|title=Innovations in computational type theory using Nuprl|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jal.2005.10.005|journal=Journal of Applied Logic|volume=4|issue=4|pages=428–469|doi=10.1016/j.jal.2005.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Coq]] is based on the [[Calculus of constructions|calculus of (co)inductive constructions]]. [[Dependent types]] also feature in the design of [[programming languages]] such as [[ATS (programming language)|ATS]], [[Cayenne (programming language)|Cayenne]], [[Epigram (programming language)|Epigram]], [[Agda (theorem prover)|Agda]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norell|first=Ulf|date=2009|title=Dependently Typed Programming in Agda|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1481861.1481862|journal=Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Types in Language Design and Implementation|series=TLDI '09|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=1–2|doi=10.1145/1481861.1481862|isbn=9781605584201}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Idris (programming language)|Idris]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brady|first=Edwin|date=2013|title=Idris, a general-purpose dependently typed programming language: Design and implementation|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-functional-programming/article/idris-a-generalpurpose-dependently-typed-programming-language-design-and-implementation/418409138B4452969AC0736DB0A2C238|journal=Journal of Functional Programming|volume=23|issue=5|pages=552–593|doi=10.1017/S095679681300018X|issn=0956-7968}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Martin-Löf type theories==

Per Martin-Löf constructed several type theories that were published at various times, some of them much later than the preprints with their description became accessible to the specialists{{Who|date=October 2017}}. The list below attempts to list all the theories that have been described in a printed form and to sketch the key features that distinguished them from each other. All of these theories had dependent products, dependent sums, disjoint unions, finite types and natural numbers. All the theories had the same reduction rules that did not include η-reduction either for dependent products or for dependent sums except for MLTT79 where the η-reduction for dependent products is added.

'''MLTT71''' was the first of type theories created by [[Per Martin-Löf]]. It appeared in a preprint in 1971. It had one universe but this universe had a name in itself, i.e. it was a type theory  with, as it is called today, "Type in Type".  [[Jean-Yves Girard]] has shown that this system was inconsistent and the preprint was never published.

'''MLTT72'''  was presented in a 1972 preprint that has now been published.&lt;ref&gt;Per Martin-Löf, An intuitionistic theory of types, Twenty-five years of constructive type theory (Venice,1995), Oxford Logic Guides, v. 36, pp. 127--172, Oxford Univ. Press, New York, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  That theory had one universe V and no identity types.  The universe was "predicative" in the sense that the dependent product of a family of objects from V over an object that was not in V such as, for example, V itself, was not assumed to be in V. The universe was a-la Russell,  i.e., one would write directly "T∈V" and "t∈T" (Martin-Löf uses the sign "∈" instead of modern ":") without the additional constructor such as "El".

'''MLTT73''' It was the first definition of a type theory that Per Martin-Löf published (it was presented at the Logic Colloquium 73 and published in 1975&lt;ref&gt;Per Martin-Löf, An intuitionistic theory of types: predicative part, Logic Colloquium '73 (Bristol, 1973), 73--118. Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics, Vol. 80, North-Holland, Amsterdam,1975&lt;/ref&gt;).  There are identity types which he calls "propositions" but since no real distinction between propositions and the rest of the types is introduced the meaning of this is unclear.  There is what later acquires the name of J-eliminator but yet without a name (see pp.&amp;nbsp;94–95).  There is in this theory an infinite sequence of universes V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,...,V&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,... . The universes are predicative, a-la Russell and ''non-cumulative''!  In fact, Corollary 3.10 on p.&amp;nbsp;115 says that if A∈V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and B∈V&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are such that A and B are convertible then m=n. This means, for example, that it would be difficult to formulate univalence in this theory—there are contractible types in each of the V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; but it is unclear how to declare them to be equal since there are no identity types connecting V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; for i≠j.

'''MLTT79''' It was presented in 1979 and published in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Per Martin-Löf, Constructive mathematics and computer programming, Logic, methodology and philosophy of science, VI (Hannover, 1979), Stud. Logic Found. Math., v. 104, pp. 153--175, North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;  In this paper, Martin-Löf introduced the four basic types of judgement for the dependent type theory that has since became fundamental in the study of the meta-theory of such systems.  He also introduced contexts as a separate concept in it (see p.&amp;nbsp;161).  There are identity types with the J-eliminator (which already appeared in MLTT73 but did not have this name there) but also with the rule that makes the theory "extensional"  (p.&amp;nbsp;169).  There are W-types.  There is an infinite sequence of predicative universes that ''are cumulative''.

'''Bibliopolis''' There is a discussion of a type theory in the Bibliopolis book from 1984&lt;ref name=MartinLöf1984&gt;Per Martin-Löf, Intuitionistic type theory, Studies in Proof Theory. Lecture Notes, v. 1, Notes by Giovanni Sambin,  pp. iv+91, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; but it is somewhat open-ended and does not seem to represent a particular set of choices and so there is no specific type theory associated with it.

'''Kairosis''' is the [[literary]] effect of fulfillment in [[time]].  This effect is normally associated with the [[Epic poetry|epic]]/[[novel]] [[genre]] of literature, and can be understood by the analogy "as ''[[catharsis]]'' is to the [[drama]]tic, so ''[[kenosis]]'' is to the [[Lyric poetry|lyric]], so ''kairosis'' is to the epic/novel."  It is derived from [[Frank Kermode|Kermode's]] usage of kairos in literary aesthetics, and is part of an ongoing debate within literary aesthetics about the limitations of the rhetorical use of the term kairos.&lt;ref&gt;Kermode, Frank. (1967). ''The Sense of Ending: Studies in the Theory of
Fiction.'' NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harker, Michael. "The Ethics of Argument: Rereading Kairos and Making
Sense in a Timely Fashion." CCC 59.1 (2007): 77-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kairosis is the feeling of integration experienced by the reader of the novel or epic form; it is experienced by the reader as the central protagonist's character and characterisation faces crisis and resolves itself into an explored and integrated personality.  This typically occurs by challenging unique and interesting characters with typical and stereotyped actions that are generally applicable to all people.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Keith.  Kenosis, katharsis, kairosis [manuscript] : a theory of literary affects.  Newcastle, Australia: The University of Newcastle, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the novel [[Emma (novel)|Emma]], kairosis is developed when an individualistic young woman attempts to play matchmaker to the world.  As her personality is challenged by the stereotypical activity of courtship and matchmaking in a young woman's life, she experiences a crisis in her character as contradictions within her personality become increasingly antagonistic.  When Emma integrates these conflicts, by performing the stereotyped action of completing a successful match, the reader experiences kairosis as Emma's character reaches a moment of synthesis that embodies the previous dialectical contradictions.

Emma's problem was not to gain a social status of marriage: we are always aware that she will be married by the end of the novel and there is no catharsis experienced as an unexpected climactic action.  Rather, we do not know if Emma is worth marrying.  This kind of moral-psychological question is at the heart of [[Jane Austen|Austen's]] work, and the modern novel.  Kairosis is experienced by the reader of the modern novel when the character reaches a moment of psychological integration in time.

Kairosis has been used as part of an attempt in [[role playing game]] (rpg) theory to grapple with the issue of [[:wikt:immersion|immersion]].&lt;ref&gt;"Mo" pseud.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26341">'''Learned helplessness''' is behavior that occurs when the subject endures repeatedly painful or otherwise aversive stimuli which it is unable to escape from or avoid. After such experiences, the organism often fails to learn or accept "escape" or "avoidance" in new situations where such behavior is likely to be effective.  In other words, the organism learned that it is helpless. In situations where there is a presence of aversive stimuli, it has accepted that it has lost control and thus gives up trying, even as changing circumstances offer a method of relief from said stimuli. Such an organism is said to have acquired learned helplessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carlson |first=Neil R. |title=Psychology the science of behavior |year=2010 |publisher=Pearson Canada |pages=409 |isbn=978-0-205-69918-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1380861/learned-helplessness|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|author=Nolen, J.L.|title=Learned helplessness|accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  '''Learned helplessness theory''' is the view that [[clinical depression]] and related [[mental illness]]es may result from such real or perceived absence of control over the outcome of a situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seligman |first=M.

American psychologist [[Martin Seligman]] initiated research on learned helplessness in 1967 at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] as an extension of his interest in depression.&lt;ref name="Seligman, M. E. P. 1972"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seligman | first1 = M. E. P. | year = 1972 | title = Learned helplessness | url = | journal = Annual Review of Medicine | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 407–412 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.me.23.020172.002203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This research was later expanded through experiments by Seligman and others. One of the first was an experiment by Seligman &amp; Maier:  In Part 1 of this study, three groups of dogs were placed in harnesses. Group 1 dogs were simply put in a harnesses for a period of time and were later released. Groups 2 and 3 consisted of "[[Yoke|yoked pairs]]". Dogs in Group 2 were given electric shocks at random times, which the dog could end by pressing a lever. Each dog in Group 3 was paired with a Group 2 dog; whenever a Group 2 dog got a shock, its paired dog in Group 3 got a shock of the same intensity and duration, but its lever did not stop the shock. To a dog in Group 3, it seemed that the shock ended at random, because it was his paired dog in Group 2 that was causing it to stop. Thus, for Group 3 dogs, the shock was "inescapable".

In Part 2 of the experiment the same three groups of dogs were tested in a shuttle-box apparatus (a chamber containing two rectangular compartments divided by a barrier a few inches high). All of the dogs could escape shocks on one side of the box by jumping over a low partition to the other side. The dogs in Groups 1 and 2 quickly learned this task and escaped the shock. Most of the Group 3 dogs – which had previously learned that nothing they did had any effect on shocks – simply lay down passively and whined when they were shocked.&lt;ref name="Seligman, M. E. P. 1972"/&gt;

In a second experiment later that year with new groups of dogs, Overmier and Seligman ruled out the possibility that, instead of learned helplessness, the Group 3 dogs failed to avert in the second part of the test because they had learned some behavior that interfered with "escape". To prevent such interfering behavior, Group 3 dogs were immobilized with a paralyzing drug ([[curare]]), and underwent a procedure similar to that in Part 1 of the Seligman and Maier experiment. When tested as before in Part 2, these Group 3 dogs exhibited helplessness as before. This result serves as an indicator for the ruling out of the interference hypothesis.

From these experiments, it was thought that there was to be only one cure for helplessness. In Seligman's hypothesis, the dogs do not try to escape because they expect that nothing they do will stop the shock. To change this expectation, experimenters physically picked up the dogs and moved their legs, replicating the actions the dogs would need to take in order to escape from the electrified grid. This had to be done at least twice before the dogs would start willfully jumping over the barrier on their own. In contrast, threats, rewards, and observed demonstrations had no effect on the "helpless" Group 3 dogs.&lt;ref name="Seligman, M. E. P. 1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Seligman, M. E. P., 1975 Scientific American&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later experiments===
Later experiments have served to confirm the depressive effect of feeling a lack of control over an aversive stimulus. For example, in one experiment, humans performed mental tasks in the presence of distracting noise. Those who could use a switch to turn off the noise rarely bothered to do so, yet they performed better than those who could not turn off the noise. Simply being aware of this option was enough to substantially counteract the noise effect.&lt;ref name="Learned helplessness in man"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hiroto | first1 = D.S. | last2 = Seligman | first2 = M.E.P. | year = 1975 | title = Generality of learned helplessness in man | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 311–27 | doi=10.1037/h0076270}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, an animal study&lt;ref&gt;Varela JA, Wang J, Varnell AL &amp; Donald C. Cooper (2011) Control over stressful stimuli induces plasticity of individual prefrontal cortical neurons: A conductance-based neural simulation. http://www.neuro-cloud.net/nature-precedings/varela Available from Nature Precedings {{DOI|10.1038/npre.2011.6267.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that animals with control over stressful stimuli exhibited changes in the excitability of certain neurons in the prefrontal cortex.  Animals that lacked control failed to exhibit this neural effect and showed signs consistent with learned helplessness and social anxiety.

==Expanded theories==
Research has found that a human's reaction to feeling a lack of control differs both between individuals and between situations.  i.e. learned helplessness sometimes remains specific to one situation but at other times generalizes across situations.&lt;ref name="Learned helplessness in man"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peterson |first=C. |last2=Park |first2=C. |year=1998 |chapter=Learned helplessness and explanatory style |editor1-first=D.

Y. |last2=Seligman |first2=M. E. P. |last3=Teasdale |first3=J.

P. |year=1995 |title=Learned Helplessness: A Theory for the Age of Personal Control |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-504467-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such people can often be helped to learn a more realistic explanatory style by [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], a therapy heavily endorsed by Seligman.

[[Bernard Weiner]] proposed a detailed account of the attributional approach to learned helplessness. His attribution theory includes the dimensions of globality/specificity, stability/instability, and [[Locus of control|internality/externality]]&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, B. (1986). An attributional theory of motivation and emotion. New York: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;:

* A ''global attribution'' occurs when the individual believes that the cause of negative events is consistent across different contexts.
** A ''specific attribution'' occurs when the individual believes that the cause of a negative event is unique to a particular situation.
* A ''stable attribution'' occurs when the individual believes the cause to be consistent across time.
** An u''nstable attribution'' occurs when the individual thinks that the cause is specific to one point in time.
* An ''external attribution'' assigns causality to situational or external factors,
** while an ''internal attribution'' assigns causality to factors within the person.&lt;ref name="Helplessness in humans" /&gt;

==Neurobiological perspective==

Research has shown that increased 5-HT ([[serotonin]]) activity in the [[dorsal raphe nucleus]] plays a critical role in learned helplessness. Other key brain regions that are involved with the expression of helpless behavior include the [[basolateral amygdala]], central nucleus of the [[amygdala]] and
[[Stria terminalis#Bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST)|bed nucleus of the stria terminalis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hammack|first1=Sayamwong|last2=Cooper|first2=Matthew|last3=Lezak|first3=Kimberly|title=Overlapping neurobiology of learned helplessness and conditioned defeat: Implications for PTSD and mood disorders|doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.02.024|work=original paper|publisher=University of Vermont}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 November 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Activity in medial prefrontal cortex, dorsal hippocampus, septum and hypothalamus has also been observed during states of helplessness.

In the article, "Exercise, Learned Helplessness, and the Stress-Resistant Brain", Benjamin N. Greenwood and Monika Fleshner discuss how exercise might prevent stress-related disorders such as anxiety and depression. They show evidence that running wheel exercise prevents learned helplessness behaviors in rats.&lt;ref&gt;idem, p82&lt;/ref&gt;  They suggest that the amount of exercise may not be as important as simply exercising at all. The article also discusses the neurocircuitry of learned helplessness, the role of serotonin (or 5-HT), and the exercise-associated neural adaptations that may contribute to the stress-resistant brain. However, the authors finally conclude that "The underlying neurobiological mechanisms of this effect, however, remain unknown. Identifying the mechanisms by which exercise prevents learned helplessness could shed light on the complex neurobiology of depression and anxiety and potentially lead to novel strategies for the prevention of stress-related mood disorders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwood|first=Benjamin|title=Excerise, Learned Helplessness, and the Stress-Resistant Brain|url=http://www.exuberantanimal.com/web/library/case_for_the_body_resources/neuro/Greenwood-2008_Exercise%20and%20the%20brain.pdf|pmid=18300002|work=original paper|publisher=University of Colorado-Boulder and Department of Integrative Physiology|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health implications==
People who perceive events as uncontrollable show a variety of symptoms that threaten their mental and physical well-being.  They experience stress, they often show disruption of emotions demonstrating passivity or aggressivity, and they can also have difficulty performing cognitive tasks such as problem-solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roth | first1 = S. | year = 1980 | title = A revised model of learned helplessness in humans | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 103–33 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1980.tb00969.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wortman, C.B. &amp; Brehm, J.W.

===Depression===
[[Abnormal psychology|Abnormal]] and [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]] psychologists have found a strong correlation between depression-like symptoms and learned helplessness in laboratory animals.&lt;ref name="Stressors"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Maier S.F. |author2=Watkins, L.R. |year=2005 |title=Stressor controllability and learned helplessness: The roles of the dorsal raphe nucleus, serotonin, and corticotropin-releasing factor |url=http://www.uvm.edu/~shammack/Maier%20and%20Watkins%202005%20review.pdf |website=uvm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young adults and middle-aged parents with a pessimistic explanatory style often suffer from depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chang | first1 = E.C. | last2 = Sanna | first2 = L.J. | year = 2007 | title = Affectivity and psychological adjustment across two adult generations: Does pessimistic explanatory style still matter? | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 1149–59 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2007.03.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They tend to be poor at problem-solving and [[cognitive restructuring]], and also tend to demonstrate poor job satisfaction and interpersonal relationships in the workplace.&lt;ref name="life stress"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Welbourne | first1 = J.L. | last2 = Eggerth | first2 = D. | last3 = Hartley | first3 = T.A. | last4 = Andrew | first4 = M.E. | last5 = Sanchez | first5 = F. | year = 2007 | title = Coping strategies in the workplace: Relationships with attributional style and job satisfaction | url = | journal = Journal of Vocational Behavior | volume = 70 | issue = | pages = 312–25 | doi=10.1016/j.jvb.2006.10.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with a pessimistic style also tend to have weakened [[immune systems]], having not only increased vulnerability to minor ailments (e.g., cold, fever) and major illness (e.g., heart attack, cancers), but also poorer recovery from health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bennett | first1 = K.K. | last2 = Elliott | first2 = M. | year = 2005 | title = Pessimistic explanatory style and Cardiac Health: What is the relation and the mechanism that links them? | url = | journal = Basic and Applied Social Psychology | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 239–48 | doi=10.1207/s15324834basp2703_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social impact===
Learned helplessness can be a factor in a wide range of social situations.
*In [[Psychological_abuse|emotionally abusive relationships]], the victim often develops learned helplessness.  This occurs when the victim confronts and/or tries to leave the abuser, only to have the abuser dismiss or trivialize the victims feelings, pretend to care but not change, and/or impede the victim from leaving {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.   
*The motivational effect of learned helplessness is often seen in the classroom.  Students who repeatedly fail may conclude that they are incapable of improving their performance, and this attribution keeps them from trying to succeed, which results in increased helplessness, continued failure, loss of self-esteem and other social consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Stipek, D.E.P. (1988). Motivation to learning. Allyn &amp; Bacon: Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ramirez | first1 = E. | last2 = Maldonado | first2 = A. | last3 = Martos | first3 = R. | year = 1992 | title = Attribution modulate immunization against learned helplessness in humans | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 139–46 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.62.1.139}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Child abuse]] by neglect can be a manifestation of learned helplessness. For example, when parents believe they are incapable of stopping an infant's crying, they may simply give up trying to do anything for the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Donovan | first1 = W.L. | last2 = Leavitt | first2 = L.A. | last3 = Walsh | first3 = R.O. | year = 1990 | title = Maternal self-efficacy: Illusory control and its effect on susceptibility to learned helplessness | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 61 | issue = | pages = 1638–47 | doi=10.2307/1130771}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Learned helplessness may be a factor in the development of a [[victim mentality]] in a child or young adult. By being repeatedly exposed to uncomfortable or painful situations, such as bullying or abuse by their peers, the person may stop trying to cope with painful social situations. This can lead to continued stress, feelings of [[self-hatred]], and maladaptive behaviors such as avoiding all social interactions {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.
*Those who are extremely shy or anxious in social situations may become passive due to feelings of helplessness {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. Gotlib and Beatty (1985) found that people who cite helplessness in social settings may be viewed poorly by others, which tends to reinforce the passivity.
*Aging individuals may respond with helplessness to the deaths of friends and family members, the loss of jobs and income, and the development of age-related health problems.  This may cause them to neglect their medical care, financial affairs, and other important needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rodin | first1 = J. | year = 1986 | title = Aging and health: Effects of the sense of control | url = | journal = Science | volume = 233 | issue = | pages = 1271–6 | doi=10.1126/science.3749877}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to Cox et al., [[Lyn Yvonne Abramson|Abramson]], [[Patricia Devine|Devine]], and Hollon (2012), learned helplessness is a key factor in depression that is caused by inescapable prejudice (i.e., "deprejudice").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox|first=William|title=Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Depression The Integrated Perspective|doi=10.1177/1745691612455204|work=original paper|accessdate=16 November 2012|url=http://www.archpsychological.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/deprejudice-txng-dep-n-prejudice-w-tx-for-other.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus: "Helplessness born in the face of inescapable prejudice matches the helplessness born in the face of inescapable shocks."&lt;ref&gt;idem, p433&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to Ruby K. Payne's book ''A Framework for Understanding Poverty'', treatment of [[poverty|the poor]] can lead to a [[cycle of poverty]], a [[Cycle of poverty#Culture of poverty|culture of poverty]], and generational poverty. This type of learned helplessness is passed from parents to children. People who embrace this mentality feel there is no way to escape poverty and so one must live in the moment and not plan for the future, trapping families in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Ruby K. Framework for understanding poverty. Highlands, Tex: Aha! Process, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social problems resulting from learned helplessness may seem unavoidable to those entrenched. However, there are various ways to reduce or prevent it. When induced in experimental settings, learned helplessness has been shown to resolve itself with the passage of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Young | first1 = L.D. | last2 = Allin | first2 = J.M. | year = 1986 | title = Persistence of learned helplessness in humans | url = | journal = Journal of General Psychology | volume = 113 | issue = | pages = 81–8 | doi=10.1080/00221309.1986.9710544}}&lt;/ref&gt; People can be immunized against the perception that events are uncontrollable by increasing their awareness of previous experiences, when they were able to affect a desired outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Altmaier | first1 = E.M. | last2 = Happ | first2 = D.A. | year = 1985 | title = Coping skills training's immunization effects against learned helplessness | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 181–9 | doi=10.1521/jscp.1985.3.2.181}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cognitive therapy]] can be used to show people that their actions do make a difference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thornton | first1 = J.W. | last2 = Powell | first2 = G.D. | year = 1974 | title = Immunization to and alleviation of learned helplessness in man | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychology | volume = 87 | issue = | pages = 351–67 | doi=10.2307/1421378}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bolster their [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Orbach | first1 = E. | last2 = Hadas | first2 = Z. | year = 1982 | title = The elimination of learned helplessness deficits as a function of induced self-esteem | url = | journal = Journal of Research in Personality | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 511–23 | doi=10.1016/0092-6566(82)90009-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extensions==
Cognitive scientist and usability engineer [[Donald Norman]] used learned helplessness to explain why people blame themselves when they have a difficult time using simple objects in their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The US [[sociologist]] [[Harrison White]] has suggested in his book ''Identity and Control'' that the notion of learned helplessness can be extended beyond psychology into the realm of social action. When a culture or political identity fails to achieve desired goals, perceptions of collective ability suffer.

==Emergence under torture==
In [[U.S. Army and CIA interrogation manuals#CIA manuals|CIA interrogation manuals]] learned helplessness is characterized as "apathy" which may result from prolonged use of coercive techniques which result in a "debility-dependency-dread" state in the subject, "If the debility-dependency-dread state is unduly prolonged, however, the arrestee may sink into a defensive apathy from which it is hard to [[torture|arouse]] him."&lt;ref name=KUBARKIX&gt;{{cite web|title=KUBARK COUNTERINTELLIGENCE  INTERROGATION|url=http://www.parascope.com/articles/0397/kub_ix.htm|publisher=CIA|accessdate=December 11, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060602231920/http://www.parascope.com/articles/0397/kub_ix.htm|archivedate=2 June 2006 |pages=Chapter IX.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3187">[[Image:Titanic lifeboat.jpg|right|thumb|Hardin uses the metaphor of a lifeboat to make his argument.]]
'''Lifeboat ethics''' is a metaphor for resource distribution proposed by the [[ecology|ecologist]] [[Garrett Hardin]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_lifeboat_ethics_case_against_helping_poor.html
|title=Lifeboat Ethics: the Case Against Helping the Poor
|accessdate=July 29, 2006
|last=Hardin|first=Garrett
|date=September 1974|publisher=''[[Psychology Today]]''
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardin's [[metaphor]] describes a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] bearing 50 people, with room for ten more.  The lifeboat is in an ocean surrounded by a hundred swimmers.  The "[[ethics]]" of the situation stem from the [[dilemma]] of whether (and under what circumstances) swimmers should be taken aboard the lifeboat.

Hardin compared the lifeboat metaphor to the [[Spaceship Earth]] model of resource distribution, which he criticizes by asserting that a spaceship would be directed by a single leader{{snd}}a captain{{snd}}which the Earth lacks.  Hardin asserts that the spaceship model leads to the [[tragedy of the commons]].  In contrast, the lifeboat metaphor presents individual lifeboats as [[wealth|rich]] nations and the swimmers as poor nations.

Other issues which can be raised include:
* Is it acceptable to deny an obviously dying passenger food and water to save it for others with a better chance to make it?
* Is it acceptable to ''jettison'' the dying passenger (knowing they will die within minutes) to make room for someone else?
* If food is low:
** is cannibalism of corpses acceptable after they die? 
** is it acceptable, if it is certain they are going to die in a day or two, to murder them to preserve resources or to let someone on the boat?
** is it acceptable, if it is certain they are going to die in a day or two, to murder them in order to commit cannibalism of their corpse where this will allow the survivors to survive for several additional weeks?

The third point regarding low supply of food had happened in reality before. A British court, in the ruling of ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]'' ruled that necessity is not a defense of murder.

Lifeboat ethics is closely related to [[environmental ethics]], [[utilitarianism]], and issues of [[resource depletion]].  Hardin uses lifeboat ethics to question [[policies]] such as [[foreign aid]], [[immigration]], and [[food bank]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2359">'''Maggot farming''' is the act of growing [[maggot]]s for the industry. It is distinct from [[vermicompost]]ing as there is no separate composting process going on, and maggots are used which are distinct from [[earthworm]]s (they also consume only flesh, not plant-based material).

==Species used==
A variety of species can be used, including the [[black soldier fly]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entologics.com/production.html Entologics growing BSF maggots]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enterrafeed.com/process/ Enterrafeed growing BSF maggots]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as various other fly species. Due to convenience, fly species are often used which are indigenous to the area of cultivation.

==Method of cultivation==
When using indigenous fly species, one tactic (employed by the Songhai Center in Benin)&lt;ref&gt;The Blue Economy: 10 years – 100 innovations – 100 million jobs by Gunther Pauli&lt;/ref&gt; is to simply dump [[offal]] or [[Food waste#Animal feed|meat that has exceeded the sell-by date]] in concrete bins. The bins are then covered with [[chicken wire]] to prevent any large animals of being able to feed off it. Then, flies deposit eggs on the offal and meat, and maggots hatch and consume it. After that, the bins are filled with water, so the maggots start to float (separating themselves from any leftovers). The maggots are then harvested and the leftover is discarded or further processed (e.g., bones can be ground to bone meal, ...).

==Use of the maggots==
The maggots are often sold and used as animal feed. Especially [[Aquaculture|fish]], chickens, pig, ducks appreciate them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://time.com/3825158/farming-flies-south-africa/ Black soldier fly farms serving aquaculture and chicken farms]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blacksoldierflyfarming.com/faq/bsf-uses Black free soldier fly maggots used as animal feed]&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be sold as fishing bait.

[[Image:HoodedClaw.JPG|thumb|right|A Masked Mystery Villain - ''[[The Hooded Claw]]'' from ''[[The Perils of Penelope Pitstop]]'']]

A '''Masked Mystery Villain''' is a [[stock character]] in [[genre fiction]]. The Masked Mystery Villain was frequently used in the [[adventure]] [[narrative|stories]] of [[Pulp magazines]] and [[Serial (film)|Movie Serials]] in the early twentieth century. They can also appear in [[Crime fiction]] to add to the atmosphere of [[suspense]] and [[suspicion (emotion)|suspicion]]. The "Mask" need not be literal (although it often is), referring more to the subterfuge involved.

He or she is the often main [[antagonist]] of the [[narrative|story]], often acting behind the scenes with [[Henchman|henchmen]] confronting the [[protagonist]]s directly. Usually, the protagonists must discover the [[villain]]'s true identity before they can be defeated. Often the Masked Mystery Villain will turn out to be either one of the protagonists themselves or a significant member of the supporting cast. The [[author]] may give the [[Audience|viewer]] or [[Audience|reader]] clues, with many [[red herring (idiom)|red herrings]], as to the [[villain]]'s identity - sometime as the [[Fictional character|characters]] find them and sometimes for the [[audience]] alone. However, the identity is not usually revealed to the [[audience]] before it is revealed to the [[character (arts)|characters]] of the story. Even the [[villain]]'s [[Henchman|henchmen]] rarely know the truth about their master.

The concept was reversed in the serials ''"[[The Lone Ranger]]"'' and ''"[[The Masked Marvel]]"'', where the true identity of the hero is unknown and a number of characters remain possible candidates until the end.

The archetype tends to be a popular one to be parodied, often using a literal mask and breaking into a stereotypical [[evil laugh]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7909">A '''McKenzie friend''' assists a [[litigant in person]] in a court of law in England and Wales, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and Australia. This person does not need to be legally qualified. The crucial point is that litigants in person (known as ''party litigants'' in Scotland) are entitled to have assistance, lay or professional, unless there are exceptional circumstances.

Their role was set out most clearly in the eponymous 1970 case ''McKenzie v McKenzie''.&lt;ref&gt;[1971] P 33; [1970] 3 [[Incorporated Council of Law Reporting|WLR]] 472; [1970] 3 All ER 1034, CA&lt;/ref&gt; Although in many cases a McKenzie friend may be an actual friend, it is often somebody with knowledge of the area, and the trend is heavily in favour of admitting McKenzie friends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familylawweek.co.uk/site.aspx?i=ed1568 McKenzie Friends], ''[[Family Law Week]]'', Retrieved 15 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  He or she may be liable for any misleading advice given to the litigant in person{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} but is not covered by [[professional indemnity]] insurance.

The role is distinct from that of a [[next friend]] or of an ''[[amicus curiae]]''.  A similar, modified principle exists in Singapore.

==Origin==
''McKenzie v. McKenzie'' was a [[divorce]] case in England.&lt;ref name="Scotsman 4May2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/little-help-from-my-friends-1-1036759|title=Little help from my friends|last=Forsyth |first=John|date=4 May 2009 |work=[[The Scotsman]]|accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Levine McKenzie, who was petitioning for divorce, had been [[Legal Aid|legally aided]] but the legal aid had been withdrawn before the case went to court. Unable to fund legal representation, McKenzie had broken off contact with his solicitors, Geoffrey Gordon &amp; Co.. However, one day before the hearing, Geoffrey Gordon &amp; Co. sent the case to an Australian barrister in London, Ian Hanger, whose qualifications in law in Australia did not allow him to practise as a barrister in London. Hanger hoped to sit with his client to prompt him, take notes and suggest questions in cross-examination, thereby providing what quiet assistance he could from the [[bar table]] to a man representing himself. The trial judge ordered Hanger not to take any active part in the case (except to advise McKenzie during [[Adjournment#Law|adjournments]]) and to sit in the public gallery of the [[court]].  Hanger assumed his limited role was futile and did not return for the second day of the trial.&lt;ref name="Scotsman 4May2009"/&gt;

The case went against McKenzie, who then appealed to the [[England and Wales Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] on the basis that he had been denied representation. On 12 June 1970, the Court of Appeal ruled that the judge's intervention had deprived McKenzie of the assistance to which he was entitled and ordered a retrial.&lt;ref name="McKenzie v McKenzie"&gt;"Litigant In Person Has Right To Assistance" (Law report), ''[[The Times]]'', 17 June 1970, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ian Hanger [[Order of Australia|AM]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], the original McKenzie friend, is now a [[Queen's Counsel]] (QC) at the [[Queensland]] Bar.&lt;ref name="Scotsman 4May2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nadrac.gov.au_CommitteeMembers_Hanger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nadrac.gov.au/www/nadrac/nadrac.nsf/Page/About_NADRACCouncil_Members|title=Council Members|publisher=[[National Alternative Dispute Resolution Advisory Committee]]|accessdate=26 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403083531/http://www.nadrac.gov.au/www/nadrac/nadrac.nsf/Page/About_NADRACCouncil_Members|archivedate=3 April 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In specific jurisdictions==

===Singapore===
In September 2006, the [[Judicial system of Singapore|Subordinate Courts of Singapore]] started a pilot project called the Lay Assistant Scheme in which persons, usually with some legal knowledge, attend hearings with litigants who are not represented by lawyers to advise them on non-legal issues and help them with administrative tasks. The scheme, a modification of the U.K.'s McKenzie friend system, is intended to assist litigants who are not eligible for legal aid as they have an annual salary exceeding S$10,000 but cannot afford a lawyer.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} For the litigant to qualify, the other party must be legally represented.

Lay assistants are not allowed to act as lawyers and may not address the court; any breach of court rules may render them liable to a maximum fine of $1,000 or imprisonment of up to six months.

Plans for introducing McKenzie friends in court proceedings were first announced by [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]] [[Chan Sek Keong]] in May 2006. Students from the Pro Bono Group of the [[National University of Singapore#Law|Faculty of Law, National University of Singapore]], have been participating in the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Ansley Ng, "[http://www.todayonline.com/articles/164112.asp Law Undergrads in Court's Pilot Scheme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312054050/http://www.todayonline.com/articles/164112.asp|date=2007-03-12}}", ''[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]'' [http://www.todayonline.com] (5 January 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

===England and Wales===
In English courts, where a case is being heard in private, the use of a McKenzie friend has sometimes been contentious. This is a particular problem in [[family court]] hearings, where it has been held that the nature of the case is so confidential that no one other than the litigants and their professional legal representatives should be admitted to the court.

A 2005 Court of Appeal case, ''In the matter of the children of Mr O'Connell, Mr Whelan and Mr Watson'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII | court = EWCA | division = Civ | year = 2005 | num = 759 | litigants = O'Connel &amp; Ors (Children) Rev 2 | date = 22 June 2005 | parallelcite = [2005] 3 WLR 1191, [2006] Fam 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; clarified the law in this area. The result of the appeal has legitimised the use of McKenzie friends in the family court and allowed the litigant to disclose confidential court papers to the McKenzie friend.

England and Wales allow fee charging McKenzie friends, who may charge for their services, including the giving of legal advice. A recent report by the Legal Service Consumer Panel found that fee charging McKenzie friends were a net benefit. The report stated, "They should be viewed as providing valuable support that improves access to justice in the large majority of cases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/apr/17/legal-watchdog-culture-shift-fee-charding-mckenzie-friends |title=Legal watchdog urges culture shift over fee-charging McKenzie friends |first=Owen |last=Bowcott |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 April 2014 |accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/practice/culture-change-needed-to-embrace-fee-charging-mckenzie-friends/5040875.fullarticle ‘Culture change’ needed to embrace fee-charging McKenzie friends], [[The Law Society Gazette]], Retrieved 15 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
Scotland has a separate legal system from England and Wales. The first recorded use of McKenzie friends in Scotland was in April 2007 in the case ''TB &amp; AM v. [[Scottish Children's Reporter Administration|The Authority Reporter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/search-judgments/judgment-search?indexCatalogue=sheriff-court-judgments&amp;searchQuery=tb+%26+am+v+the+authority+reporter&amp;wordsMode=0&lt;/ref&gt; The one major difference between England and Scotland is that in Scotland McKenzie friends are not permitted to receive remuneration.

'''Metric time''' is the measure of time interval using the [[metric system]], which defines the [[second]] as the base unit of time, and multiple and submultiple units formed with [[metric prefix]]es, such as kiloseconds and milliseconds. It does not define the time of day, as this is defined by various time scales, which may be based upon the metric definition of the second. Other units of time, the [[minute]], [[hour]], and [[day]], are accepted for use with the [[SI|modern metric system]], but are not part of it.

==History==
Although part of the decimal metric system, the second derives its name from the [[sexagesimal]] system, which originated with the [[Sumer|Sumerians]] and [[Babylonia]]ns, and divides a base unit into sixty minutes, minutes into sixty seconds, seconds into sixty [[Sexagesimal#Modern usage|tierces]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://findwords.info/term/tierce|title=What does tierce mean|website=findwords.info|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.  The word "minute" comes from the Latin ''pars minuta prima'', meaning first small part, and "second" from ''pars minuta secunda'' or second small part.  [[Angular measure]] also uses these sexagesimal units; in that field, it is the [[Degree (angle)|degree]] that is subdivided into minutes and seconds, while in time, it is the hour.

When the metric system was introduced in [[France]] in 1795, it included units for length, area, dry volume, liquid capacity, weight or mass, and even currency, but not for time. [[Decimal time]] of day had been introduced in France two years earlier, but was set aside at the same time the metric system was inaugurated, and did not follow the metric pattern of a base unit and prefixed units. [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[Elihu Thomson]] (through the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] - BAAS) introduced the [[Centimetre gram second system of units]] (cgs) in 1874, in order to derive electric and magnetic metric units, following the recommendation of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in 1832.

The ephemeris second (defined as 1/86400 of a mean solar day) was made one of the original base units of the modern metric system, or International System of Units ([[SI]]), at the 10th [[Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures|General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) in 1954. Because the planet Earth's rotation is [[Leap second|slowly decelerating at an irregular rate]] and was thus unsuitable as a reference point for precise measurements, the SI second was later redefined more precisely as
the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the [[ground state]] of the [[caesium]]-133 atom. The international standard [[atomic clock]]s use caesium-133 measurements as their main benchmark.

==Alternative units==
Numerous proposals have been made for alternative base units of metric time. On March 28, 1794, the president of the commission which developed the [[metric system]], [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], proposed in a report to the commission the names ''déci-jour'' and ''centi-jour'' ([[deci]]day and [[centi]]day in English).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JlsoAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage#PPA606,M1 Procès-verbaux du Comité d'instruction publique de la Convention nationale by James Guillaume]&lt;/ref&gt; Base units equivalent to decimal divisions of the day, such as 1/10, 1/100, 1/1000, or 1/100,000 day, or other divisions of the day, such as 1/20 or 1/40 day, have also been proposed, with various names, and multiple and submultiple units formed with metric prefixes. Such alternative units have not gained any notable acceptance.

A decimal second = 1/100,000 of a day = 0.864 s is an obvious alternative. Any redefinition of the second, however, creates conflicts with anything based on its precise current definition.

[[Swatch Internet Time]] introduced a time unit called .beat, equal to the French decimal minute, with 1,000 decimal minutes in a day. In the French decimal time system there are 100 decimal seconds in a decimal minute. As there are 100,000 decimal seconds in the day, the decimal second is shorter than its counterpart. See [[Decimal time#Conversions]].

Another unit for time, more familiar than some other suggestions, could be 14.4 minutes, i.e. a shorter ''quarter of an hour'', or a ''centiday'', as proposed by Lagrange. The centiday (called ''[[Traditional Chinese timekeeping|kè]]'' in [[Chinese language|Chinese]]) was used in [[China]] for thousands of years.{{CN|date=December 2018}}

In the 19th century, Joseph Charles François de Rey-Pailhade proposed using the centiday, abbreviated ''cé'', divided into 10 ''decicés'', 100 ''centicés'', 1000 ''millicés''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heuresdumonde.com/histoire-dheure.html?start=2 Histoire d'heure - Fractionnement du temps] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522083043/http://heuresdumonde.com/histoire-dheure.html?start=2 |date=2015-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 10000 ''dimicés''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FTsCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA189 AJB, Volume 9, 1907]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xMgBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA255 Report of the Sixth International Geographical Congress: Held in London, 1895]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, the ''Commission de décimalisation du temps'' was created by the French [[Bureau of Longitude]], with the mathematician [[Henri Poincaré]] as secretary. The commission proposed making the standard [[hour]] the base unit of metric time, but the proposal did not gain acceptance and was eventually abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0393326047 Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps: empires of time By Peter Louis Galison]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative meaning==
{{see also|Decimal time}}
Metric time is sometimes used to mean [[decimal time]]. Metric time properly refers to measurement of time interval, while decimal time refers to the time of day. Standard time of day is usually measured by the [[24-hour clock]] or its closely related derivative, the [[12-hour clock]].  These measurement systems are now based on the metric base unit of time, the second. Some proposals for alternative units of metric time are accompanied by decimal time scales for telling the time of day. Other proposals called "metric time" refer only to decimal time and are therefore not truly metric.

[[France|French]] decimal time is sometimes called "metric time" because it was introduced around the same time as the metric system and both were decimal.  The April 7, 1795 decree creating the original metric units and prefixes actually suspended decimal time, which had named its units the (decimal) [[hour]], [[minute]] and [[second]] instead of using metric prefixes.

==In computing==
In computing, at least internally, metric time gained widespread use for ease of computation. [[Unix time]] gives date and time as the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, and Microsoft's FILETIME as multiples of 100ns since January 1, 1601.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms724284.aspx FILETIME documentation on MSDN]&lt;/ref&gt; [[OpenVMS#Timekeeping|VAX/VMS]] uses the number of 100ns since November 17, 1858 and [[RISC OS]] the number of centiseconds since January 1, 1900.

None of these systems is strictly linear, as they each have discontinuities at [[leap second]]s.

==Fractions of a second==
While larger metric prefixes of a second are rarely used, subdivision prefixes are well established within science and technology. Milliseconds, microseconds and smaller units (but not centiseconds) are well established.

==Problems==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
One problem lies in the size of time units created using metric prefixes. The [[International System of Units]] has developed [[metric prefix|prefixes]] to express units as [[exponentiation|exponential]] multiples or sub-multiples. The first three multiples would be viable for use within a metric time system; they are:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center; margin-left: 2.5%; table-layout: fixed"
! Multiple
! Name of Unit
! Seconds
! Minutes
|-
| 10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; || decasecond || 10 || 0.166
|-
| 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; || hectosecond || 100 || 1.666
|-
| 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; || kilosecond || 1&amp;nbsp;000 || 16.666
|}

However, the next multiples are:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center; margin-left: 2.5%; table-layout: fixed"
! Multiple !! Name of Unit !! Seconds !! Minutes !! Hours !! Days !! Years
|-
| 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; || megasecond || 1&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000 || 16&amp;nbsp;666.666 || 277.777 || 11.574 || 0.032
|-
| 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; || gigasecond || 1&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000 || 16&amp;nbsp;666&amp;nbsp;666.666 || 277&amp;nbsp;777.777 || 11&amp;nbsp;574.074 || 31.688
|}

Such lengths of time are relatively impractical for measuring human activities.

For decimal multiples of the metric time unit to be practical, [[si units|standard units]] and prefixes would need to be developed or revived for the 4th and 5th exponents so that it becomes viable for measuring human life. Historically, the metric system included a ''[[myria-]]'' prefix to represent 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; (and a counterpart ''dimi-'' prefix for 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;), but SI (introduced in 1960) omitted the prefixes and prohibited using multiple prefixes such as decahecto-, a workaround also in use prior to the SI, leaving no way to name those orders of magnitude. 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; was represented using various ''[[ad hoc]]'' solutions; 100 000 [[Metre|meters]] composed a [[Gradian|grade]], 100 000 [[Pascal (unit)|pascals]] composed a [[bar (unit)|bar]], and 100 000 [[dyne]]s composed a [[Newton (unit)|newton]]; most of these conversions stem from compatible units that were used in the SI (and its predecessor, [[MKS system of units|MKS]]) and the [[Centimetre–gram–second system of units|CGS system of units]]. Meteorologists currently use a unit of 100 000 seconds (a quantity on the order of a day) to quantify atmospheric [[vorticity]] at the synoptic scale; the unit, however, does not have a formal name.

The only way to express a nonstandard order of magnitude as an SI unit is to combine two prefixed [[SI derived unit]]s whose component base units cancel out; for example, units of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; seconds could be expressed as ''[[kilojoule]]s per centiwatt'' (kJ/cW) or ''hectocoulombs per [[milliampere]]'' (hC/mA). Such misuse of SI derived units can create a [[cognitive dissonance]]; to do so requires the invocation of units not directly related to the quantity being measured (coulombs and amperes, for example, quantify electricity, making it awkward to combine the two in a way that creates a unit of time with no electrical component).

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center; margin-left: 2.5%; table-layout: fixed"
! Multiple !! Name of Unit !! Seconds !! Minutes !! Hours !! Days
|-
| 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; || "myriasecond" || 10&amp;nbsp;000 || 166.6 || 2.777 || 0.116
|-
| 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; || ''No formal name'' ||  100&amp;nbsp;000 || 1&amp;nbsp;666.6 || 27.77 || 1.157
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5533">{{Hinduism}}
In [[Hinduism]], and in particular [[Jnana Yoga]] and [[Advaita Vedanta]], '''''neti neti''''' (नेति नेति) is a [[Sanskrit]] expression which means "not this, not this", or "neither this, nor that" (''{{IAST|neti}}'' is [[sandhi]] from ''{{IAST|na iti}}'' "not so"). It is found in the [[Upanishads]] and the [[Avadhuta Gita]] and constitutes an analytical meditation helping a person to understand the nature of [[Brahman]] by first understanding what is not [[Brahman]]. It corresponds to the western ''[[via negativa]]'', a mystical approach that forms a part of the tradition of [[apophatic theology]]. One of the key elements of Jnana Yoga practice is often a "neti neti search." The purpose of the exercise is to negate rationalizations and other distractions from the non-conceptual meditative awareness of reality.

==Significance of neti neti==

Neti neti, meaning, "Not this, not this", is the method of Vedic analysis of negation. It is a keynote of Vedic inquiry.  With its aid the Jnani negates identification with all things of this world which is not the Atman, in this way he negates the [[Anatman (Hinduism)|Anatman]]. Through this gradual process he negates the mind and transcends all worldly experiences that are negated till nothing remains but the Self. He attains union with the Absolute by denying the body, name, form, intellect, senses and all limiting adjuncts and discovers what remains, the true "I" alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Meditation and Mantras:An Authoritative Text|author=Vishnu Devanand|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|place=New Delhi|page=119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JgnTT0eqwIoC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=Neti+Neti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WrXWUM7LOo_rrQevl4CQDg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Neti%20Neti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; L.C.Beckett in his book, ''Neti Neti,'' explains that this expression is an expression of something inexpressible, it expresses the ‘suchness’ (the essence) of that which it refers to when ‘no other definition applies to it’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lotus Effect|author=Pavel G.

[[Adi Shankara]] was one of the foremost [[List of teachers of Advaita Vedanta|Advaita philosophers]] who advocated the neti-neti approach. In his commentary on [[Gaudapada]]’s Karika, he explains that [[Brahman]] is free from adjuncts and the function of ''neti neti'' is to remove the obstructions produced by ignorance. His disciple, Sureshvara, further explains that the negation, ''neti neti'', does not have negation as its purpose, it purports identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Negative Theory|author=Harold G.

And therefore, there exists no separate entity like [[Jiva]] which Shankara states is the reflection of Brahman in Avidya (ignorance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sacred Books of the Hindus Vol.5, Part 1|author=Baman Das Basu|publisher=Genesis Publishing (P) Ltd.|page=480|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=szMvRnYw6QsC&amp;pg=PA480&amp;dq=Neti+Neti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_7zWUKzXH46Prgeb9IHYBw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Neti%20Neti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IAST]]:

neti neti śrutirbrūyād anṛtaṁ pāñcabhautikam //25//

By such sentences as "[[Tat Tvam Asi|That thou art]]," our own Self is affirmed. Of that which is untrue and composed of the five elements - the Sruti (scripture) says, "Not this, not this."

{{Refimprove|date=September 2008}}
'''Nonsense''' is a [[Linguistics|communication]], via [[speech]], [[writing]], or any other [[symbolic system]], that lacks any coherent [[semantics|meaning]]. Sometimes in ordinary usage, nonsense is synonymous with [[absurdity]] or the [[ridiculous]]. Many [[poet]]s, [[novelist]]s and [[songwriter]]s have used nonsense in their works, often creating entire works using it for reasons ranging from pure comic amusement or satire, to illustrating a point about language or reasoning. In the philosophy of language and philosophy of science, nonsense is distinguished from [[sense]] or meaningfulness, and attempts have been made to come up with a [[coherence (linguistics)|coherent]] and [[consistent]] method of distinguishing sense from nonsense. It is also an important field of study in [[cryptography]] regarding separating a [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] from [[signal noise|noise]].

== Literary ==
[[Image:1862ca-a-book-of-nonsense--edward-lear-001.jpg|thumb|''A Book of Nonsense'' (c. 1875 James Miller edition) by Edward Lear]]
{{Main|Literary nonsense}}
The phrase "[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]]" was coined by [[Noam Chomsky]] as an example of nonsense. However, this can easily be confused with [[poetic symbolism]]. The individual ''words'' make sense and are arranged according to proper [[grammar|grammatical rules]], yet the result is nonsense. The inspiration for this attempt at creating verbal nonsense came from the idea of [[contradiction]] and seemingly irrelevant and/or incompatible characteristics, which conspire to make the phrase meaningless, but are open to interpretation. The phrase "the square root of Tuesday" (not a similar example; the lemondrop sunshine is more comparable){{vague|date=June 2014}} operates on the latter principle. This principle is behind the inscrutability of the ''[[kōan]]'' "What is the sound of one hand clapping?", where one hand would presumably be insufficient for clapping without the intervention of another.

[[James Joyce]]’s final novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' also uses nonsense: full of [[portmanteau]] and strong words, it ''appears'' to be pregnant with multiple layers of meaning, but in many passages it is difficult to say whether any one human’s interpretation of a text could be the intended or unintended one.

=== Verse ===
''[[Jabberwocky]]'', a [[Poetry|poem]] (of [[nonsense verse]]) found in ''[[Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]] (1871), is a nonsense poem written in the English language. The word ''jabberwocky'' is also occasionally used as a synonym of nonsense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/jabberwocky|title=the definition of Jabberwocky|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonsense verse is the verse form of literary nonsense, a genre that can manifest in many other ways.  Its best-known exponent is [[Edward Lear]], author of ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat]]'' and hundreds of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]].

Nonsense verse is part of a long line of tradition predating Lear: the [[nursery rhyme]] ''[[Hey Diddle Diddle]]'' could also be termed a nonsense verse. There are also some works which ''appear'' to be nonsense verse, but actually are not, such as the popular 1940s song [[Mairzy Doats]].

Lewis Carroll, seeking a nonsense riddle, once posed the question ''How is a [[common raven|raven]] like a writing desk?''. Someone answered him, ''Because [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]] wrote on both''. However, there are other possible answers (e.g. ''both have inky [[quill]]s'').

Lines of nonsense frequently figure in the [[refrain]]s of [[Folk music|folksong]]s, where nonsense [[riddle]]s and [[knock-knock joke]]s are often encountered.

====Examples====
The first verse of ''[[Jabberwocky]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]];

''Oh Freddled Gruntbuggly'' by [[Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz]]; a creation of [[Douglas Adams]]
{{Quotation|&lt;poem&gt;

Thy micturations are to me
As plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee.
Groop I implore thee, my foonting turlingdromes,
And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles,
Or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts
With my blurglecruncheon, see if I don't!
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

== Philosophy of language and of science ==
{{Further|Sense}}
In the [[philosophy of language]] and the [[philosophy of science]], nonsense refers to a lack of [[sense]] or [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]]. Different technical definitions of meaning delineate sense from nonsense.

=== Logical positivism ===
{{Further|Logical positivism}}

=== Wittgenstein ===
{{Further|Ludwig Wittgenstein}}
In [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s writings, the word "nonsense" carries a special technical meaning which differs significantly from the normal use of the word.  In this sense, "nonsense" does not refer to meaningless gibberish, but rather to the lack of sense in the context of [[sense and reference]].  In this context, logical [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], and purely mathematical propositions may be regarded as "nonsense". For example, "1+1=2" is a nonsensical proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=md-KV6HUueUC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=wittgenstein+tautology+nonsense|title=Wittgenstein: the way out of the fly-bottle |first=Severin |last=Schroeder |publisher=Polity |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-7456-2615-4 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein wrote in [[Tractatus Logico Philosophicus]] that some of the propositions contained in his own book should be regarded as nonsense.&lt;ref&gt;Biletzki, Anat and Anat Matar, "Ludwig Wittgenstein", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2008 Edition) "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/#Sen ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'']"&lt;/ref&gt; Used in this way, "nonsense" does not necessarily carry negative connotations.

Starting from Wittgenstein, but through an original perspective, the Italian philosopher Leonardo Vittorio Arena, in his book ''Nonsense as the meaning'', highlights this positive meaning of nonsense to undermine every philosophical conception which does not take note of the absolute lack of meaning of the world and life. Nonsense implies the destruction of all views or opinions, on the wake of the Indian Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna. In the name of nonsense, it is finally refused the conception of duality and the Aristotelian formal logic.

==Cryptography==
The problem of distinguishing sense from nonsense is important in [[cryptography]] and other [[intelligence agency|intelligence]] fields.  For example, they need to distinguish [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] from [[signal noise|noise]].  [[Cryptanalysis|Cryptanalysts]] have devised [[algorithm]]s to determine whether a given text is in fact nonsense or not. These algorithms typically analyze the presence of repetitions and [[Redundancy (linguistics)|redundancy]] in a text; in meaningful texts, certain frequently used words recur, for example, ''the'', ''is'' and ''and'' in a text in the [[English language]]. A [[Randomness|random]] scattering of letters, punctuation marks and spaces do not exhibit these regularities. [[Zipf's law]] attempts to state this analysis mathematically. By contrast, cryptographers typically seek to make their [[cipher]] texts resemble random distributions, to avoid telltale repetitions and patterns which may give an opening for cryptanalysis.

It is harder for cryptographers to deal with the presence or absence of meaning in a text in which the level of redundancy and repetition is ''higher'' than found in [[natural language]]s (for example, in the mysterious text of the [[Voynich manuscript]]).

== Teaching machines to talk nonsense ==
{{See also|SCIgen}}
Scientists have attempted to teach machines to produce nonsense.  The Markov chain technique is one method which has been used to generate texts by algorithm and randomizing techniques that seem meaningful. Another method is sometimes called the ''[[Mad Libs]]'' method: it involves creating templates for various [[Sentence (linguistics)#By structure|sentence structures]] and filling in the blanks with [[noun phrase]]s or [[verb phrase]]s; these phrase-generation procedures can be looped to add [[recursion]], giving the output the appearance of greater complexity and sophistication. [[Racter]] was a computer program which generated nonsense texts by this method; however, Racter’s book, ''The Policeman’s Beard is Half Constructed'', proved to have been the product of heavy human editing of the program's output.

In [[mathematics]], a '''partial differential equation''' ('''PDE''') is a [[differential equation]] that contains beforehand unknown [[Multivariable calculus|multivariable functions]] and their [[partial derivative]]s. PDEs are used to formulate problems involving functions of several variables, and are either solved by hand, or used to create a [[computer model]]. A special case is [[ordinary differential equation]]s (ODEs), which deal with [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of a single variable and their [[derivative]]s.

PDEs can be used to describe a wide variety of phenomena such as [[sound]], [[heat]], [[diffusion]], [[electrostatics]], [[electrodynamics]], [[fluid dynamics]], [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], or [[quantum mechanics]]. These seemingly distinct physical phenomena can be formalised similarly in terms of PDEs. Just as ordinary differential equations often model one-dimensional [[dynamical system]]s, partial differential equations often model [[multidimensional system]]s. PDEs find their generalisation in [[stochastic partial differential equation]]s.

== Introduction ==
Partial differential equations (PDEs) are equations that involve rates of change with respect to [[continuous variables]]. The position of a [[rigid body]] is specified by six parameters,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9PLbcYd9aUC&amp;pg=PA32|title=Modelling and Control of Robot Manipulators|last=Sciavicco|first=Lorenzo|last2=Siciliano|first2=Bruno|date=2001-02-19|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781852332211|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the configuration of a [[fluid]] is given by the [[continuous distribution]] of several parameters, such as the [[temperature]], [[pressure]], and so forth. The dynamics for the rigid body take place in a finite-dimensional [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]]; the dynamics for the fluid occur in an infinite-dimensional configuration space. This distinction usually makes PDEs much harder to solve than ordinary differential equations (ODEs), but here again, there will be simple solutions for linear problems. Classic domains where PDEs are used include [[acoustics]], [[fluid dynamics]], [[electrodynamics]], and [[heat transfer]].

A partial differential equation (PDE) for the function {{math|''u''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,… ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} is an equation of the form

: &lt;math&gt;f \left (x_1, \ldots x_n; u, \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1}, \ldots \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_n}; \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_1 \partial x_1}, \ldots \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_1 \partial x_n}; \ldots \right) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

If {{mvar|f}} is a [[linear function]] of {{mvar|u}} and its derivatives, then the PDE is called linear. Common examples of linear PDEs include the [[heat equation]], the [[wave equation]], [[Laplace's equation]], [[Helmholtz equation]], [[Klein–Gordon equation]], and [[Poisson's equation]].

A relatively simple PDE is

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(x,y) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This relation [[Logical implication|implies]] that the function {{math|''u''(''x'',''y'')}} is independent of {{mvar|x}}. However, the equation gives no information on the function's dependence on the variable {{mvar|y}}. Hence the general solution of this equation is

: &lt;math&gt;u(x,y) = f(y),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|f}} is an arbitrary function of {{mvar|y}}. The analogous ordinary differential equation is

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d} u}{\mathrm{d} x}(x) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

which has the solution

: &lt;math&gt;u(x) = c,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|c}} is any [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]] value. These two examples illustrate that general solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) involve arbitrary constants, but solutions of PDEs involve arbitrary functions. A solution of a PDE is generally not [[Uniqueness quantification|unique]]; additional conditions must generally be specified on the [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the region where the solution is defined. For instance, in the simple example above, the function {{math|''f''(''y'')}} can be determined if {{mvar|u}} is specified on the line {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}.

== Existence and uniqueness ==
Although the issue of existence and uniqueness of solutions of ordinary differential equations has a very satisfactory answer with the [[Picard–Lindelöf theorem]], that is far from the case for partial differential equations. The [[Cauchy–Kowalevski theorem]] states that the [[Cauchy problem]] for any partial differential equation whose coefficients are [[Analytic function|analytic]] in the unknown function and its derivatives, has a locally unique analytic solution. Although this result might appear to settle the existence and uniqueness of solutions, there are examples of linear partial differential equations whose coefficients have derivatives of all orders (which are nevertheless not analytic) but which have no solutions at all: see [[Lewy's example|Lewy (1957)]]. Even if the solution of a partial differential equation exists and is unique, it may nevertheless have undesirable properties.  The mathematical study of these questions is usually in the more powerful context of [[weak solution]]s.

An example of pathological behavior is the sequence (depending upon {{mvar|n}}) of [[Cauchy problem]]s for the [[Laplace equation]]

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}=0,&lt;/math&gt;

with [[boundary condition]]s

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} u(x,0) &amp;= 0, \\ \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}(x,0) &amp;= \frac{\sin nx}{n}, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|n}} is an integer. The derivative of {{mvar|u}} with respect to {{mvar|y}} approaches zero [[uniform convergence|uniformly]] in {{mvar|x}} as {{mvar|n}} increases, but the solution is

: &lt;math&gt;u(x,y) = \frac{\sinh ny \sin nx}{n^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This solution approaches infinity if {{mvar|nx}} is not an integer multiple of {{pi}} for any non-zero value of {{mvar|y}}. The Cauchy problem for the Laplace equation is called ''ill-posed'' or ''not [[Well-posed problem|well-posed]]'', since the solution does not continuously depend on the data of the problem. Such ill-posed problems are not usually satisfactory for physical applications.

The existence of solutions for the [[Navier–Stokes equations]], a partial differential equation, is part of one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]].

== Notation ==
In PDEs, it is common to denote partial derivatives using subscripts. That is:

: &lt;math&gt;u_x = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;u_{xx} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;u_{xy} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y\, \partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y } \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

Especially in physics, [[del]] or nabla ({{math|∇}}) is often used to denote spatial derivatives, and {{math|''u&amp;#x307;'', ''ü''}} for time derivatives. For example, the [[wave equation]] (described below) can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot u=c^2\nabla^2u&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot u=c^2\Delta u&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|Δ}} is the [[Laplace operator]].

== Classification ==
Some linear, second-order partial differential equations can be classified as [[parabolic partial differential equation|parabolic]], [[hyperbolic partial differential equation|hyperbolic]] and [[elliptic partial differential equation|elliptic]]. Others, such as the [[Euler–Tricomi equation]], have different types in different regions. The classification provides a guide to appropriate initial and boundary conditions and to the smoothness of the solutions.

=== Equations of first order ===

{{main|First-order partial differential equation}}

=== Linear equations of second order ===
Assuming {{math|''u&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''u&lt;sub&gt;yx&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, the general linear second-order PDE in two independent variables has the form

: &lt;math&gt;Au_{xx} + 2Bu_{xy} + Cu_{yy} + \cdots \mbox{(lower order terms)} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficients {{mvar|A}}, {{mvar|B}}, {{mvar|C}}... may depend upon {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}. If {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''C''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 0}} over a region of the {{mvar|xy}}-plane, the PDE is second-order in that region. This form is analogous to the equation for a conic section:

: &lt;math&gt;Ax^2 + 2Bxy + Cy^2 + \cdots = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
More precisely, replacing {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} by {{mvar|X}}, and likewise for other variables (formally this is done by a [[Fourier transform]]), converts a constant-coefficient PDE into a polynomial of the same degree, with the top degree (a [[homogeneous polynomial]], here a [[quadratic form]]) being most significant for the classification.

Just as one classifies [[conic section]]s and quadratic forms into parabolic, hyperbolic, and elliptic based on the [[discriminant]] {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 4''AC''}}, the same can be done for a second-order PDE at a given point.  However, the [[discriminant]] in a PDE is given by {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''AC''}} due to the convention of the {{mvar|xy}} term being {{math|2''B''}} rather than {{mvar|B}}; formally, the discriminant (of the associated quadratic form) is {{math|(2''B'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 4''AC'' {{=}} 4(''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''AC'')}}, with the factor of 4 dropped for simplicity.

# {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''AC'' &lt; 0}} (''[[elliptic partial differential equation]]''): Solutions of [[elliptic partial differential equation|elliptic PDEs]] are as smooth as the coefficients allow, within the interior of the region where the equation and solutions are defined. For example, solutions of Laplace's equation are analytic within the domain where they are defined, but solutions may assume boundary values that are not smooth. The motion of a fluid at subsonic speeds can be approximated with elliptic PDEs, and the Euler–Tricomi equation is elliptic where {{math|''x'' &lt; 0}}.
# {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''AC'' {{=}} 0}} (''[[parabolic partial differential equation]]''): Equations that are [[parabolic partial differential equation|parabolic]] at every point can be transformed into a form analogous to the [[heat equation]] by a change of independent variables. Solutions smooth out as the transformed time variable increases. The Euler–Tricomi equation has parabolic type on the line where {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}.
# {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''AC'' &gt; 0}} (''[[hyperbolic partial differential equation]]''): [[hyperbolic partial differential equation|hyperbolic]] equations retain any discontinuities of functions or derivatives in the initial data. An example is the wave equation. The motion of a fluid at supersonic speeds can be approximated with hyperbolic PDEs, and the Euler–Tricomi equation is hyperbolic where {{math|''x'' &gt; 0}}.

If there are {{mvar|n}} independent variables {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;,… ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, a general linear partial differential equation of second order has the form

: &lt;math&gt;L u =\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n a_{i,j} \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} \quad \text{ plus lower-order terms} =0.&lt;/math&gt;

The classification depends upon the signature of the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

# Elliptic: the eigenvalues are all positive or all negative.
# Parabolic: the eigenvalues are all positive or all negative, save one that is zero.
# Hyperbolic: there is only one negative eigenvalue and all the rest are positive, or there is only one positive eigenvalue and all the rest are negative.
# Ultrahyperbolic: there is more than one positive eigenvalue and more than one negative eigenvalue, and there are no zero eigenvalues. There is only a limited theory for ultrahyperbolic equations (Courant and Hilbert, 1962).

=== Systems of first-order equations and characteristic surfaces ===
The classification of partial differential equations can be extended to systems of first-order equations, where the unknown {{mvar|u}} is now a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] with {{mvar|m}} components, and the coefficient matrices {{mvar|A&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;}} are {{mvar|m}} by {{mvar|m}} matrices for {{math|''ν'' {{=}} 1, 2,… ''n''}}. The partial differential equation takes the form

: &lt;math&gt;Lu = \sum_{\nu=1}^{n} A_\nu \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_\nu} + B=0,&lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficient matrices {{mvar|A&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the vector {{mvar|B}} may depend upon {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|u}}. If a [[hypersurface]] {{mvar|S}} is given in the implicit form

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n)=0,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|φ}} has a non-zero gradient, then {{mvar|S}} is a '''characteristic surface''' for the operator {{mvar|L}} at a given point if the characteristic form vanishes:

: &lt;math&gt;Q\left(\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial x_1}, \ldots\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial x_n}\right) =\det\left[\sum_{\nu=1}^nA_\nu \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x_\nu}\right]=0.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The geometric interpretation of this condition is as follows: if data for {{mvar|u}} are prescribed on the surface {{mvar|S}}, then it may be possible to determine the normal derivative of {{mvar|u}} on {{mvar|S}} from the differential equation. If the data on {{mvar|S}} and the differential equation determine the normal derivative of {{mvar|u}} on {{mvar|S}}, then {{mvar|S}} is non-characteristic. If the data on {{mvar|S}} and the differential equation ''do not'' determine the normal derivative of {{mvar|u}} on {{mvar|S}}, then the surface is '''characteristic''', and the differential equation restricts the data on {{mvar|S}}: the differential equation is ''internal'' to {{mvar|S}}.

# A first-order system {{math|''Lu'' {{=}} 0}} is ''elliptic'' if no surface is characteristic for {{mvar|L}}: the values of {{mvar|u}} on {{mvar|S}} and the differential equation always determine the normal derivative of {{mvar|u}} on {{mvar|S}}.
# A first-order system is ''hyperbolic'' at a point if there is a '''spacelike''' surface {{mvar|S}} with normal {{mvar|ξ}} at that point. This means that, given any non-trivial vector {{mvar|η}} orthogonal to {{mvar|ξ}}, and a scalar multiplier {{mvar|λ}}, the equation {{math|''Q''(''λξ'' + ''η'') {{=}} 0}} has {{mvar|m}} real roots {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,… ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The system is '''strictly hyperbolic''' if these roots are always distinct. The geometrical interpretation of this condition is as follows: the characteristic form {{math|''Q''(''ζ'') {{=}} 0}} defines a cone (the normal cone) with homogeneous coordinates ζ. In the hyperbolic case, this cone has {{mvar|m}} sheets, and the axis {{math|''ζ'' {{=}} ''λξ''}} runs inside these sheets: it does not intersect any of them. But when displaced from the origin by η, this axis intersects every sheet. In the elliptic case, the normal cone has no real sheets.

=== Equations of mixed type ===
If a PDE has coefficients that are not constant, it is possible that it will not belong to any of these categories but rather be of '''mixed type'''. A simple but important example is the [[Euler–Tricomi equation]]

: &lt;math&gt;u_{xx} = xu_{yy},&lt;/math&gt;

which is called '''elliptic-hyperbolic''' because it is elliptic in the region {{math|''x'' &lt; 0}}, hyperbolic in the region {{math|''x'' &gt; 0}}, and degenerate parabolic on the line {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}.
&lt;!--
''fill in: Dirichlet and Neumann boundaries, hyperbolic/parabolic/elliptic separation of variables, [[Fourier analysis]], [[Green's function]]s ...--&gt;

=== Infinite-order PDEs in quantum mechanics ===
In the [[phase space formulation]] of quantum mechanics,  one may consider the [[Method of quantum characteristics|quantum Hamilton's equations]] for trajectories of quantum particles. These equations are infinite-order PDEs. However, in the semiclassical expansion, one has a finite system of ODEs at any fixed order of [[Dirac constant|{{mvar|ħ}}]].  The evolution equation of the [[Wigner quasi-probability distribution|Wigner function]] is also an infinite-order PDE. The quantum trajectories are [[Method of quantum characteristics|quantum characteristics]], with the use of which one could calculate the evolution of the Wigner function.

== Analytical solutions ==

===Separation of variables===
{{main|Separable partial differential equation}}
Linear PDEs can be reduced to systems of ordinary differential equations by the important technique of separation of variables. This technique rests on a characteristic of solutions to differential equations: if one can find any solution that solves the equation and satisfies the boundary conditions, then it is ''the'' solution (this also applies to ODEs). We assume as an [[ansatz]] that the dependence of a solution on the parameters space and time can be written as a product of terms that each depend on a single parameter, and then see if this can be made to solve the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gershenfeld|first1=Neil|title=The nature of mathematical modeling|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521570956|page=27|edition=Reprinted (with corr.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the method of separation of variables, one reduces a PDE to a PDE in fewer variables, which is an ordinary differential equation if in one variable – these are in turn easier to solve.

This is possible for simple PDEs, which are called [[separable partial differential equation]]s, and the domain is generally a rectangle (a product of intervals). Separable PDEs correspond to [[diagonal matrices]] – thinking of "the value for fixed {{mvar|x}}" as a coordinate, each coordinate can be understood separately.

This generalizes to the [[method of characteristics]], and is also used in [[integral transform]]s.

===Method of characteristics===
{{main|Method of characteristics}}
In special cases, one can find characteristic curves on which the equation reduces to an ODE – changing coordinates in the domain to straighten these curves allows separation of variables, and is called the [[method of characteristics]].

More generally, one may find characteristic surfaces.

===Integral transform===
An [[integral transform]] may transform the PDE to a simpler one, in particular, a separable PDE. This corresponds to diagonalizing an operator.

An important example of this is [[Fourier analysis]], which diagonalizes the heat equation using the [[eigenbasis]] of sinusoidal waves.

If the domain is finite or periodic, an infinite sum of solutions such as a [[Fourier series]] is appropriate, but an integral of solutions such as a [[Fourier integral]] is generally required for infinite domains. The solution for a point source for the heat equation given above is an example of the use of a Fourier integral.

===Change of variables===

Often a PDE can be reduced to a simpler form with a known solution by a suitable [[Change of variables (PDE)|change of variables]].  For example, the [[Black–Scholes equation#Derivation|Black–Scholes]] PDE

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \tfrac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} + rS\frac{\partial V}{\partial S} - rV = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

is reducible to the [[heat equation]]

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial u}{\partial \tau} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

by the change of variables (for complete details see {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411030405/http://www.math.unl.edu/~sdunbar1/Teaching/MathematicalFinance/Lessons/BlackScholes/Solution/solution.shtml |date=April 11, 2008 |title=Solution of the Black Scholes Equation }})

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
V(S,t) &amp;= K v(x,\tau),\\[5px]
x &amp;= \ln\left(\tfrac{S}{K} \right),\\[5px]
\tau &amp;= \tfrac{1}{2} \sigma^2 (T - t),\\[5px]
v(x,\tau)&amp;=e^{-\alpha x-\beta\tau} u(x,\tau).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Fundamental solution===
{{main|Fundamental solution}}
Inhomogeneous equations can often be solved (for constant coefficient PDEs, always be solved) by finding the [[fundamental solution]] (the solution for a point source), then taking the [[convolution]] with the boundary conditions to get the solution.

This is analogous in [[signal processing]] to understanding a filter by its [[impulse response]].

===Superposition principle===
{{further| Superposition principle }}
The superposition principle applies to any linear system, including linear systems of PDEs. A common visualization of this concept is the interaction of two waves in phase being combined to result in a greater amplitude, for example {{math|sin ''x'' + sin ''x'' {{=}} 2 sin ''x''}}. The same principle can be observed in PDEs where the solutions may be real or complex and additive. [[Superposition principle|superposition]]
If {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are solutions of linear PDE in some function space {{mvar|R}}, then {{math|''u'' {{=}} ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} with any constants {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are also a solution of that PDE in the same function space.

===Methods for non-linear equations===
{{see also|nonlinear partial differential equation}}

There are no generally applicable methods to solve nonlinear PDEs. Still, existence and uniqueness results (such as the [[Cauchy–Kowalevski theorem]]) are often possible, as are proofs of important qualitative and quantitative properties of solutions (getting these results is a major part of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]). Computational solution to the nonlinear PDEs, the [[split-step method]], exist for specific equations like [[nonlinear Schrödinger equation]].

Nevertheless, some techniques can be used for several types of equations. The [[h-principle|{{mvar|h}}-principle]] is the most powerful method to solve [[Underdetermined system|underdetermined]] equations. The [[Riquier–Janet theory]] is an effective method for obtaining information about many analytic [[Overdetermined system|overdetermined]] systems.

The [[method of characteristics]] ([[similarity transformation method]]) can be used in some very special cases to solve partial differential equations.

In some cases, a PDE can be solved via [[perturbation analysis]] in which the solution is considered to be a correction to an equation with a known solution. Alternatives are [[numerical analysis]] techniques from simple [[finite difference]] schemes to the more mature [[multigrid]] and [[finite element method]]s. Many interesting problems in science and engineering are solved in this way using [[computer]]s, sometimes high performance [[supercomputer]]s.

===Lie group method===
From 1870 [[Sophus Lie]]'s work put the theory of differential equations on a more satisfactory foundation. He showed that the integration theories of the older mathematicians can, by the introduction of what are now called [[Lie group]]s, be referred to a common source; and that ordinary differential equations which admit the same [[infinitesimal transformation]]s present comparable difficulties of integration. He also emphasized the subject of [[contact transformation|transformations of contact]].

A general approach to solving PDEs uses the symmetry property of differential equations, the continuous [[infinitesimal transformation]]s of solutions to solutions ([[Lie theory]]). Continuous [[group theory]], [[Lie algebras]] and [[differential geometry]] are used to understand the structure of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations for generating integrable equations, to find its [[Lax pair]]s, recursion operators, [[Bäcklund transform]] and finally finding exact analytic solutions to the PDE.

Symmetry methods have been recognized to study differential equations arising in mathematics, physics, engineering, and many other disciplines.

===Semianalytical methods===
The [[adomian decomposition method]], the [[Aleksandr Lyapunov|Lyapunov]] artificial small parameter method, and He's [[homotopy perturbation method]] are all special cases of the more general [[homotopy analysis method]]. These are series expansion methods, and except for the Lyapunov method, are independent of small physical parameters as compared to the well known [[perturbation theory]], thus giving these methods greater flexibility and solution generality.

== Numerical solutions ==
The three most widely used numerical methods to solve PDEs are the [[finite element analysis|finite element method]] (FEM), [[finite volume method]]s (FVM) and [[finite difference method]]s (FDM), as well other kind of methods called [[Meshfree methods]], which were made to solve problems where the before mentioned methods are limited. The FEM has a prominent position among these methods and especially its exceptionally efficient higher-order version [[hp-FEM]]. Other hybrid versions of FEM and Meshfree methods include the generalized finite element method (GFEM), [[extended finite element method]] (XFEM), [[Spectral element method|spectral finite element method]] (SFEM), [[Meshfree methods|meshfree finite element method]], [[Discontinuous Galerkin Method|discontinuous Galerkin finite element method]] (DGFEM), [[Element-Free Galerkin Method]] (EFGM), [[Interpolating Element-Free Galerkin Method]] (IEFGM), etc.

=== Finite element method ===
{{main|Finite element method}}
The finite element method (FEM) (its practical application often known as finite element analysis (FEA)) is a numerical technique for finding approximate solutions of partial differential equations (PDE) as well as of integral equations. The solution approach is based either on eliminating the differential equation completely (steady state problems), or rendering the PDE into an approximating system of ordinary differential equations, which are then numerically integrated using standard techniques such as Euler's method, Runge–Kutta, etc.

===Finite difference method===
{{main|Finite difference method}}
Finite-difference methods are numerical methods for approximating the solutions to differential equations using [[finite difference]] equations to approximate derivatives.

=== Finite volume method ===
{{main|Finite volume method}}
Similar to the finite difference method or finite element method, values are calculated at discrete places on a meshed geometry. "Finite volume" refers to the small volume surrounding each node point on a mesh. In the finite volume method, surface integrals in a partial differential equation that contain a divergence term are converted to volume integrals, using the [[divergence theorem]]. These terms are then evaluated as fluxes at the surfaces of each finite volume. Because the flux entering a given volume is identical to that leaving the adjacent volume, these methods conserve mass by design.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9232">'''Philosophical analysis''' (from {{lang-el|Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση}}) is the techniques typically used by [[philosopher]]s in the [[analytic philosophy|analytic tradition]] that involve "breaking down" (i.e. analyzing) philosophical issues. Arguably the most prominent of these techniques is the analysis of [[concept]]s (known as ''conceptual analysis'').

==Method of analysis==
While analysis is characteristic of the analytic tradition in philosophy, what is to be analyzed (the ''analysandum'') often varies. Some philosophers focus on analyzing linguistic phenomena, such as [[sentence (linguistics)|sentences]], while others focus on psychological phenomena, such as [[sense data]]. However, arguably the most prominent analyses are of concepts or [[proposition]]s, which is known as ''conceptual analysis'' (Foley 1996).

Conceptual analysis consists primarily in breaking down or analyzing concepts into their constituent parts in order to gain knowledge or a better understanding of a particular philosophical issue in which the concept is involved (Beaney 2003). For example, the [[problem of free will]] in philosophy involves various key concepts, including the concepts of freedom, moral responsibility, determinism, ability, etc. The method of conceptual analysis tends to approach such a problem by breaking down the key concepts pertaining to the problem and seeing how they interact. Thus, in the long-standing debate on whether [[free will]] is compatible with the doctrine of [[determinism]], several philosophers have proposed analyses of the relevant concepts to argue for either [[compatibilism]] or [[incompatibilism]].

A famous author of conceptual analysis at its best is Bertrand Russell's [[theory of descriptions]]. Russell attempted to analyze propositions that involved ''definite descriptions'' (such as "The tallest spy"), which pick out a unique individual, and ''indefinite descriptions'' (such as "a spy"), which pick out a set of individuals. Take Russell's analysis of definite descriptions as an example.&lt;ref&gt;Note that this explication is only of a part of Russell's theory of descriptions and is quite brief and oversimplified.&lt;/ref&gt; Superficially, definite descriptions have the standard subject-predicate form of a proposition. For example, "The present [[king of France]] is [[baldness|bald]]" appears to be predicating "baldness" of the subject "the present king of France". However, Russell noted that this is problematic, because there is no present king of France (France is [[France#Republics and Empires (1792-)|no longer a monarchy]]). Normally, to decide whether a proposition of the standard subject-predicate form is true or false, one checks whether the subject is in the extension of the predicate. The proposition is then true if and only if the subject is in the extension of the predicate. The problem is that there is no present king of France, so the present king of France cannot be found on the list of bald things or non-bald things. So, it would appear that the proposition expressed by "The present king of France is bald" is neither true nor false. However, analyzing the relevant concepts and propositions, Russell proposed that what definite descriptions really express are not propositions of the subject-predicate form, but rather they express existentially quantified propositions. Thus, "The present king of France" is ''analyzed'', according to Russell's theory of descriptions, as "There exists an individual who is currently the king of France, there is only one such individual, and that individual is bald." Now one can determine the [[truth value]] of the proposition. Indeed, it is false, because it is not the case that there exists a unique individual who is currently the king of France and is bald—since there is no present king of France (Bertolet 1999).

==Controversy==
While the method of analysis is characteristic of contemporary analytic philosophy, its status continues to be a source of great controversy even among analytic philosophers. Several current criticisms of the analytic method derive from W.V. Quine's famous rejection of the [[analytic–synthetic distinction]]. While Quine's critique is well-known, it is highly controversial.

Further, the analytic method seems to rely on some sort of definitional structure of concepts, so that one can give necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of the concept. For example, the concept "bachelor" is often analyzed as having the concepts "unmarried" and "male" as its components. Thus, the definition or analysis of "bachelor" is thought to be an unmarried male. But one might worry that these so-called necessary and sufficient conditions do not apply in every case. Wittgenstein, for instance, argues that language (e.g., the word 'bachelor') is used for various purposes and in an indefinite number of ways. Wittgenstein's famous thesis states that meaning is determined by use. This means that, in each case, the meaning of 'bachelor' is determined by its use in a context. So if it can be shown that the word means different things across different contexts of use, then cases where its meaning cannot be essentially defined as 'married bachelor' seem to constitute counterexamples to this method of analysis. This is just one example of a critique of the analytic method derived from a critique of definitions. There are several other such critiques (Margolis &amp; Laurence 2006). This criticism is often said to have originated primarily with Wittgenstein's ''Philosophical Investigations''.

A third critique of the method of analysis derives primarily from psychological critiques of [[intuition (psychology)|intuition]]. A key part of the analytic method involves analyzing concepts via "intuition tests". Philosophers tend to motivate various conceptual analyses by appeal to their intuitions about thought experiments. (See DePaul and Ramsey (1998) for a collection of current essays on the controversy over analysis as it relates to intuition and [[reflective equilibrium]].)

In short, some philosophers feel strongly that the analytic method (especially conceptual analysis) is essential to and defines philosophy—e.g. Jackson (1998), Chalmers (1996), and Bealer (1998). Yet, some philosophers argue that the method of analysis is problematic—e.g. Stich (1998) and Ramsey (1998). Some, however, take the middle ground and argue that while analysis is largely a fruitful method of inquiry, philosophers should not limit themselves to only using the method of analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5008">'''Popper's three worlds''' is a way of looking at [[reality]], described by the British philosopher [[Karl Popper]] in a lecture in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/p/popper80.pdf Three Worlds by Karl Popper - The Tanner Lecture on Human Values] - Delivered by Karl Popper at The University of Michigan on April 7, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept involves three interacting worlds, called '''World 1''', '''World 2''' and '''World 3'''.&lt;ref name=Heller&gt;Heller, Michael. ''Philosophy in Science: An Historical Introduction''. Springer, 2011, p. 118ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worlds 1, 2 and 3==
Popper split the world into three categories:

* World 1: the world of physical [[object (philosophy)|object]]s and [[event (philosophy)|event]]s, including [[biology|biological]] entities
* World 2: the world of [[mind|mental]] objects and events
* World 3: objective knowledge

==The interaction of World 1 and World 2==
The theory of interaction between World 1 and World 2 is an alternative theory to [[Cartesian dualism]], which is based on the theory that the universe is composed of two essential substances: ''[[res cogitans]]'' and ''[[res extensa]]''. Popperian cosmology rejects this [[essentialism]], but maintains the common sense view that physical and mental states exist, and they interact.

==World 3==
Popper's World 3 contains the products of thought. This includes abstract [[object (philosophy)|object]]s such as [[scientific theories]], [[narrative|stories]], [[mythology|myth]]s, [[tool]]s, [[Institution|social institutions]], and works of art.&lt;ref name=Heller/&gt; World 3 is not to be conceived as a [[Platonic realm]], because it is created by humans.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Charles Jarvie, Karl Milford, David W. Miller (eds.), ''Karl Popper: Metaphysics and epistemology'', Ashgate Publishing, 2006, p. 61: "the most important difference between platonism and Popper is the fact that World 3 is created by human beings..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==The interaction of World 2 and World 3==
The interaction of World 2 and World 3 is based on the theory that World 3 is partially autonomous. For example, the development of [[scientific theories]] in World 3 leads to [[unintended consequence]]s, in that problems and contradictions are discovered by World 2. Another example is that the process of [[learning]] causes World 3 to change World 2.

==The interaction of World 1 and World 3==
Other entities are contained in World 3, such as feats of [[engineering]] and [[art]]. The World 3 objects, although they exist in World 1, are embodied and given extra meaning by World 3. For example, the intrinsic value of [[Hamlet]] as a World 3 object is embodied many times in World 1, the physical world. This idea would be something along the lines of a [[Meta|meta-object]], or a [[Intelligible form|form]] of [[being]].

==The interaction of World 1, World 2 and World 3==
As a pluralist, laid out in his Tanner Lecture, Popper views interactions between all three worlds as a matter of course. This is similar to the linkages made by William Kirk between the 'phenomenal environment' of physical facts and social facts and decisions made in the 'behavioural environment'. &lt;ref&gt; Kirk, William, 1963 ''Problems of geography, Geography'',1963, 48, 4, p. 357-371&lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;ref&gt; Kirk, William, 1989 'Historical geography and the concept of the behavioural environment' In The behavioural Environment, eds Boal, F.W and Livingstone, D.N. Ch 2, 18-30&lt;/ref&gt; A discussion between Popper's three worlds and Kirk's views has been made by Bird &lt;ref&gt;Bird, J.H. 'Geography in three worlds: How Popper's system can help elucidate dichotomies and changes in the discipline' The Professional Geographer, 1985, 37, 4, 403-409&lt;/ref&gt; who also discusses the three worlds in relation to methodological implications for geography. &lt;ref&gt;Bird, J.H. 'Methodological implications for geography from the philosophy of KR Popper' Scottish Geographical Magazine, 1975, 91, 3, 153-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Privacy-invasive software''' is [[computer software]] that ignores [[user (computing)|user]]s’ [[privacy]] and that is distributed with a specific intent, often of a [[commerce|commercial]] nature. Three typical examples of privacy-invasive software are [[adware]], [[spyware]] and [[content hijacking]] programs.

== Background ==
In a digital setting, such as the Internet, there are a wide variety of [[data privacy|privacy]] threats. These vary from the tracking of user activity (sites visited, items purchased etc.), to [[mass marketing]] based on the retrieval of personal information ([[spam (electronic)|spam]] offers and [[telemarketing]] calls are more common than ever), to the distribution of information on lethal technologies used for, e.g., acts of [[terrorism|terror]].

Today, software-based privacy-invasions occur in numerous aspects of Internet usage. [[Spyware]] programs set to collect and distribute user information secretly download and execute on users’ workstations. [[Adware]] displays [[advertising|advertisements]] and other commercial content often based upon personal information retrieved by spyware programs. System monitors record various actions on computer systems. [[Keylogger]]s record users’ keystrokes in order to monitor user behavior. Self-replicating malware downloads and spreads disorder in systems and networks. Data-harvesting software programmed to gather [[e-mail]] addresses have become conventional features of the Internet, which among other things results in that spam e-mail messages fill networks and computers with unsolicited commercial content. With those threats in mind, we hereby define privacy-invasive software as:

== Definition ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
::{{cquote|''Privacy-invasive software is a category of software that ignores users’ right to be left alone and that is distributed with a specific intent, often of a commercial nature, which negatively affect[s] its users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boldt|first1=Martin|title=Privacy-Invasive Software Exploring Effects and Countermeasures|journal=Blekinge Institute of Technology Licentiate Dissertation Series|date=2007|volume=01}}&lt;/ref&gt; }} 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this context, ''ignoring users’ right to be left alone'' means that the software is unsolicited and that it does not permit users to determine for themselves when, how and to what extent personally identifiable data is gathered, stored or processed by the software. ''Distributed'' means that it has entered the computer systems of users from (often unknown) [[server (computing)|server]]s placed on the [[Internet]] infrastructure. ''Often of a commercial nature'' means that the software (regardless of type or quality) is used as a tool in some sort of a commercial plan to gain revenues.

== Problem with the spyware concept ==

In early 2000, [[Steve Gibson (computer programmer)|Steve Gibson]] formulated the first description of [[spyware]] after realizing software that stole his personal information had been installed on his computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Gibson | title=GRC  OptOut -- Internet Spyware Detection and Removal | publisher=[[Gibson Research Corporation]] | url=http://www.grc.com/optout.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; His definition reads as follows:

::{{cquote|''Spyware is any software which employs a user’s Internet connection in the background (the so-called ‘backchannel’) without their knowledge or explicit permission.''}}

This definition was valid in the beginning of the spyware evolution. However, as the spyware concept evolved over the years it attracted new kinds of behaviours. As these behaviours grew both in number and in diversity, the term spyware became hollowed out. This evolution resulted in that a great number of synonyms sprang up, e.g. thiefware, scumware, trackware, and [[badware]]. It is believed that the lack of a single standard definition of spyware depends on the diversity in all these different views on what really should be included, or as Aaron Weiss put it:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Weiss | first=A. | title=Spyware Be Gone | work=ACM netWorker |volume=9 |issue=1 | place=ACM Press, New York, USA | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::{{cquote|''What the old-school intruders have going for them is that they are relatively straightforward to define. Spyware, in its broadest sense, is harder to pin down. Yet many feel, as the late Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart once said, ‘I know it when I see it.’.''}}

Despite this vague comprehension of the essence in spyware, all descriptions include two central aspects. The degree of associated user [[consent]], and the level of negative impact they impair on the user and their computer system (further discussed in Section 2.3 and Section 2.5 in {{Harv |Boldt|2007a}}). Because of the diffuse understanding in the spyware concept, recent attempts to define it have been forced into compromises. The [[Anti-Spyware Coalition]] (ASC) which is constituted by public interest groups, trade associations, and anti-spyware companies, have come to the conclusion that the  term spyware should be used at two different abstraction levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last=ASC | title=Anti-Spyware Coalition | url=http://www.antispywarecoalition.org | date = 2006-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the low level they use the following definition, which is similar to Steve Gibson’s original one:

::{{cquote|''In its narrow sense, Spyware is a term for tracking software deployed without adequate notice, consent, or control for the user.''}}

However, since this definition does not capture all the different types of spyware available they also provide a wider definition, which is more abstract in its appearance:

::{{cquote|''In its broader sense, spyware is used as a synonym for what the ASC calls ‘Spyware (and Other Potentially Unwanted Technologies)’. Technologies deployed without appropriate user consent and/or implemented in ways that impair user control over:
1) Material changes that affect their user experience, privacy, or system security; &lt;br /&gt;
2) Use of their system resources, including what programs are installed on their computers; and/or &lt;br /&gt;
3) Collection, use, and distribution of their personal or other sensitive information.''}}

Difficulties in defining spyware, forced the ASC to define what they call ''Spyware (and Other Potentially Unwanted Technologies)'' instead. This includes any software that does not have the users’ appropriate consent for running on their computers. Another group that has tried to define spyware is a group called [[StopBadware|StopBadware.org]], which consists of actors such as [[Harvard Law School]], [[Oxford university|Oxford University]], [[Google]], [[Lenovo]], and [[Sun Microsystems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=StopBadware.org | title=StopBadware.org | url=http://www.stopbadware.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their result is that they do not use the term spyware at all, but instead introduce the term ''badware''. Their definition thereof span over seven pages, but the essence looks as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=StopBadware.org Guidelines |title=StopBadware.org Software Guidelines |url=http://www.stopbadware.org/home/guidelines |work=StopBadware.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928001515/http://www.stopbadware.org/home/guidelines |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

::{{cquote|''An application is badware in one of two cases:
1) If the application acts deceptively or irreversibly. &lt;br /&gt;
2) If the application engages in potentially objectionable behaviour without: first, prominently disclosing to the user that it will engage in such 
behaviour, in clear and non-technical language, and then obtaining the user's affirmative consent to that aspect of the application.''}}

Both definitions from ASC and StopBadware.org show the difficulty with defining spyware. We therefore regard the term spyware at two different abstraction levels. On the lower level it can be defined according to Steve Gibsons original definition. However, in its broader and in a more abstract sense the term spyware is hard to properly define, as concluded above.

== Introducing the term, &amp;#8220;privacy-invasive software&amp;#8221; ==
A joint conclusion is that it is important, for both software vendors and users, that a clear separation between acceptable and unacceptable software behaviour is established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Bruce | first=J. | title=Defining Rules for Acceptable Adware | work=Proceedings of the 15th Virus Bulletin Conference | place=Dublin, Ireland | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Sipior | first=J.C. | title=A United States Perspective on the Ethical and Legal Issues of Spyware | work=Proceedings of 7th International Conference on Electronic Commerce | place=Xian, China | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is the subjective nature of many spyware programs included, which result in inconsistencies between different users beliefs, i.e. what one user regards as legitimate software could be regarded as a spyware by others. As the spyware concept came to include increasingly more types of programs, the term got hollowed out, resulting in several synonyms, such as trackware, evilware and badware, all negatively emotive. We therefore choose to introduce the term ''privacy-invasive software'' to encapsulate all such software. We believe this term to be more descriptive than other synonyms without having as negative connotation. Even if we use the word ''invasive'' to describe such software, we believe that an invasion of [[privacy]] can be both desired and beneficial for the user as long as it is fully [[Transparency (humanities)|transparent]], e.g. when implementing specially user-tailored services or when including personalization features in software. [[File:Privacy-Invasive Software Classification.png|thumb|300px|right|A three-by-three matrix classification of privacy-invasive software showing legitimate, spyware and malicious software. {{Harv|Boldt|2010|p=110}}]]

The work by Warkentins et al. (described in Section 7.3.1 in {{Harv |Boldt|2007a}}) can be used as a starting point when developing a classification of privacy-invasive software, where we classify privacy-invasive software as a combination between ''user consent'' and ''direct negative consequences''. User consent is specified as either ''low'', ''medium'' or ''high'', while the degree of direct negative consequences span between ''tolerable'', ''moderate'', and ''severe''. This classification allows us to first make a distinction between legitimate software and spyware, and secondly between spyware and malicious software. All software that has a low user consent, ''or'' which impairs severe direct negative consequences should be regarded as malware. While, on the other hand, any software that has high user consent, ''and'' which results in tolerable direct negative consequences should be regarded as legitimate software. By this follows that spyware constitutes the remaining group of software, i.e. those that have medium user consent or which impair moderate direct negative consequences. This classification is described in further detail in Chapter 7 in {{Harv |Boldt|2007a}}.

In addition to the direct negative consequences, we also introduce ''indirect negative consequences''. By doing so our classification distinguishes between any negative behaviour a program has been designed to carry out (direct negative consequences) and security threats introduced by just having that software executing on the system (indirect negative consequences). One example of an indirect negative consequence is the exploitation risk of [[Software vulnerability|software vulnerabilities]] in programs that execute on users’ systems without their knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Saroiu | first=S. | last2=Gribble | first2=S.D. | last3=Levy | first3=H.M. | title=Measurement and Analysis of Spyware in a University Environment | work=Proceedings of the 1st Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI) | place=San Francisco, USA | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison to malware ==
The term privacy-invasive software is motivated in that software types such as adware and spyware are essentially often defined according to their actions instead of their distribution mechanisms (as with most malware definitions, which also rarely correspond to motives of, e.g., business and commerce). The overall intention with the concept of privacy-invasive software is consequently to convey the commercial aspect of unwanted software contamination. The threats of privacy-invasive software consequently do not find their roots in totalitarianism, malice or political ideas, but rather in the free market, advanced technology and the unbridled exchange of electronic information. By the inclusion of purpose in its definition, the term privacy-invasive software is a contribution to the research community of privacy and security.

== History ==

=== Internet goes commercial ===
In the mid-1990s, the development of the Internet increased rapidly due to the interest from the general public. One important factor behind this accelerating increase was the 1993 release of the first browser, called [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last= Andreessen | first=M. | title=NCSA Mosaic Technical Summary | publisher=National Center for Supercomputing Applications | place=USA | year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the birth of the graphically visible part of the Internet known as the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW) that was introduced in 1990.  Commercial interests became well aware of the potential offered by the WWW in terms of electronic commerce especially because the restrictions on the commercial use of the Internet were removed which opened the space for companies to use the web as a platform to advertise and sell their goods. Thus, shortly after, companies selling goods over the Internet emerged, i.e. pioneers such as book dealer [[Amazon.com]] and CD retailer [[CDNow|CDNOW.com]], which both were founded in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last= Rosenberg | first=R.S. | title=The Social Impact of Computers | edition=3rd | publisher= Place=Elsevier Academic Press, San Diego CA | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the following years, personal computers and [[broadband]] connections to the Internet became more commonplace. Also, the increased use of the Internet resulted in that [[e-commerce]] transactions involved considerable amounts of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Abhijit | first=C. | last2= Kuilboer | first2=J.P. | title=E-Business &amp; E-Commerce Infrastructure: Technologies Supporting the E-Business Initiative | publisher=McGraw Hill | place= Columbus, USA | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; As competition over customers intensified, some e-commerce companies turned to questionable methods in their battle to entice customers into completing transactions with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=CDT | title=Following the Money | publisher=Center for Democracy &amp; Technology | url=https://www.cdt.org/files/privacy/20060320adware.pdf | year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last= Shukla | first=S. | last2=Nah | first2=F.F. | title=Web Browsing and Spyware Intrusion | work=Communications of the ACM | volume=48 |issue=8 | pages=85 | place=New York, USA | year=2005 | doi = 10.1145/1076211.1076245}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opened ways for illegitimate actors to gain revenues by stretching the limits used with methods for collecting personal information and for propagating commercial advertisements. Buying such services allowed for some e-commerce companies to get an advantage over their competitors, e.g. by using advertisements based on unsolicited commercial messages (also known as [[E-mail spam|spam]]) {{Harv |Jacobsson|2004}}.

=== Commercially motivated adverse software ===
The use of questionable techniques, such as [[Spam (electronic)|Spam]], were not as destructive as the more traditional malicious techniques, e.g. [[computer virus]]es or [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan horses]]. Compared to such malicious techniques the new ones differed in two fundamental ways. First, they were not necessarily illegal, and secondly, their main goal was gaining money instead of creating publicity for the creator by reaping digital havoc. Therefore, these techniques grouped as a “grey”{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}area next to the already existing “dark”{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} side of the Internet.

Behind this development stood advertisers that understood that Internet was a “merchant’s utopia”,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} offering huge potential in global advertising coverage at a relatively low cost. By using the Internet as a global notice board, e-commerce companies could market their products through advertising agencies that delivered [[online ads]] to the masses. In 2004, online advertisement yearly represented between $500 million and $2 billion markets, which in 2005 increased to well over $6 billion-a-year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=McFedries | first=P. | title=The Spyware Nightmare | publisher=in IEEE Spectrum, Volume 42, Issue 8 | place=Nebraska, USA | year= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Zhang | first=X. | title=What Do Consumers Really Know About Spyware? | publisher=ACM | work=Communications of the ACM | volume=48 |issue=8 | pages=44 | year=2005 | doi = 10.1145/1076211.1076238}}&lt;/ref&gt; The larger online advertising companies report annual revenues in excess of $50 million each.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=CNET | title=The Money Game: How Adware Works and How it is Changing | publisher=CNET Anti Spyware Workshop, San Francisco, US | place= | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of this development such companies distributed their ads in a [[broadcast]]-like manner, i.e. they were not streamlined towards individual users’ interests. Some of these ads were served directly on Web sites as banner ads, but dedicated programs, called [[adware]], soon emerged. Adware were used to display ads through [[pop-up ad|pop-up]] windows without depending on any Internet access or Web pages.

=== The birth of spyware ===
In the search for more effective advertising strategies, these companies soon discovered the potential in ads that were targeted towards user interests. Once targeted online ads started to appear, the development took an unfortunate turn. Now, some advertisers developed software that became known as [[spyware]], collecting users’ personal interests, e.g. through their [[Internet privacy#Browsing profiles|browsing habits]]. Over the coming years spyware would evolve into a significant new threat to Internet-connected computers, bringing along reduced system performance and security. The information gathered by spyware were used for constructing user profiles, including personal interests, detailing what users could be persuaded to buy. The introduction of online advertisements also opened a new way to fund software development by having the software display advertisements to its users. By doing so the software developer could offer their software “free of charge”, since they were paid by the advertising agency. Unfortunately, many users did not understand the difference between “free of charge” and a “free gift”, where difference is that a free gift is given without any expectations of future compensation, while something provided free of charge expects something in return. A dental examination that is provided free of charge at a dentist school is not a free gift. The school expects gained training value and as a consequence the customer suffers increased risks. As adware were combined with spyware, this became a problem for computer users. When downloading software described as “free of charge” the users had no reason to suspect that it would report on for instance their Internet usage, so that presented advertisements could be targeted towards their interests.
 
Some users probably would have accepted to communicate their browsing habits because of the positive feedback, e.g. “offers” relevant to their interests. However, the fundamental problem was that users were not properly informed about neither the occurrence nor the extent of such monitoring, and hence were not given a chance to decide on whether to participate or not. As advertisements became targeted, the borders between adware and spyware started to dissolve, combining both these programs into a single one, that both monitored users and delivered targeted ads. The fierce competition soon drove advertisers to further “enhance” the ways used for serving their ads, e.g. replacing user-requested content with sponsored messages instead, before showing it to the users.

=== The arms-race between spyware vendors ===
As the chase for faster financial gains intensified, several competing advertisers turned to use even more illegitimate methods in an attempt to stay ahead of their competitors. This targeted advertising accelerated the whole situation and created a “gray” between conventional adds that people chose to see, such as subscribing to an Internet site &amp; adds pushed on users through "pop-up adds" or downloaded adds displayed in a program itself.
&lt;ref name=AAA&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spywareloop.com/news/privacy-invasive-software |title=Privacy Invasive Software in SpyWareLoop.com |author=Vincentas |newspaper=''Spyware Loop'' |date=11 July 2013 |accessdate=27 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409013525/http://www.spywareloop.com/news/privacy-invasive-software |archivedate=9 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This practice pushed Internet advertising closer to the “dark” side of Spam &amp; other types of invasive, privacy compromising advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Görling | first=S. | title=An Introduction to the Parasite Economy | publisher=In Proceedings of EICAR | place=Luxemburg | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this development, users experienced infections from unsolicited software that crashed their computers by accident, change application settings, harvested personal information, and deteriorated their computer experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Pew |first=Internet |title=The Threat of Unwanted Software Programs is Changing the Way People use the Internet |work=PIP Spyware Report July 05 |publisher=Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Spyware_Report_July_05.pdf |year=2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713160443/http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Spyware_Report_July_05.pdf |archivedate=July 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time these problems led to the introduction of countermeasures in the form of anti-spyware tools.

These tools purported to clean computers from spyware, adware, and any other type of shady software located in that same “gray” area. This type of software can lead to false positives as some types of legitimate software came to be branded by some users as "Spyware" (i.e. Spybot: Search &amp; Destroy identifies the ScanSpyware program as a Spybot.) These tools were designed similarly to anti-[[malware]] tools, such as [[antivirus software]]. Anti-spyware tools identify programs using signatures (semantics, program code, or other identifying attributes). The process only works on known programs, which can lead to the false positives mentioned earlier &amp; leave previously unknown spyware undetected. To further aggravate the situation, a few especially illegitimate companies distributed fake anti-spyware tools in their search for a larger piece of the online advertising market. These fake tools claimed to remove spyware, but instead installed their own share of adware and spyware on unwitting users’ computers. Sometimes even accompanied by the functionality to remove adware and spyware from competing vendors. Anti-Spyware has become a new area of online vending with fierce competition.

New spyware programs are being added to the setting in what seems to be a never-ending stream, although the increase has levelled out somewhat over the last years. However, there still does not exist any consensus on a common spyware definition or classification, which negatively affects the accuracy of anti-spyware tools. As mentioned above, some spyware programs remain undetected on users' computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Good | first=N. | title=User Choices and Regret: Understanding Users’ Decision Process about Consentually Acquired Spyware | publisher=I/S: A Journal of Law and Policy for the Information Society, Volume 2, Issue 2 | place=Columbus, USA | year=2006|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=MTL | title=AntiSpyware Comparison Reports | publisher=Malware-Test Lab | place=http://www.malware-test.com/antispyware.html | year=2006}}{{dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developers of anti-spyware programs officially state that the fight against spyware is more complicated than the fight against [[computer virus|viruses]], [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan horses]], and [[computer worm|worms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Webroot |title=Differences between Spyware and Viruses |publisher=Webroot Software |work=Spysweeper.com |url=http://research.spysweeper.com/differences.html |year=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001180224/http://research.spysweeper.com/differences.html |archivedate=2007-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Predicted future development ==
There are several trends integrating computers and software into people’s daily lives. One example is traditional media-oriented products which are being integrated into a single device, called [[Home theater PC|media centres]]. These media centres include the same functionality as conventional television, [[DVD]]-players, and stereo equipment, but combined with an Internet connected computer. In a foreseeable future these media centres are anticipated to reach vast consumer impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=CES | title=International Consumer Electronics Association | url=http://www.cesweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Newman | first=M.W. | title=Recipes for Digital Living | work=IEEE Computer | place=Vol. 39, Issue 2 | year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this setting, spyware could monitor and surveillance for instance what television channels are being watched, when/why users change channel or what [[DVD]] movies users have purchased and watch. This is information that is highly attractive for any advertising or media-oriented corporation to obtain. This presents us with a probable scenario where spyware is tailored towards these new platforms; the technology needed is to a large extent the same as is used in spyware today.

Another interesting area for spyware vendors is the increasing amount of mobile devices being shipped. Distributors of advertisements have already turned their eyes to these devices. So far this development have not utilized the geographic position data stored in these devices. However, during the time of this writing companies are working on [[GPS]]-guided ads and coupons destined for mobile phones and hand-held devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Business 2.0 Magazine | title=20 Smart Companies to Start Now | url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2006/09/01/8384349/index.htm | date=October 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, development of location-based marketing that allow advertising companies to get access to personal geographical data so that they can serve geographically dependent ads and coupons to their customers. Once such geographic data is being harvested and correlated with already accumulated personal information, another privacy barrier has been crossed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6309">'''Real utopian sociology''' is a [[sociology]] and type of emancipatory [[social science]] created and practiced by [[Erik Olin Wright]]. The seemingly contradictory term is literal, as the goal of real [[utopia]]n sociology is finding utopian projects in the world as it exists and systematically evaluating their potential to replace systems of domination, particularly capitalism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~wright/OVERVIEW.html|title=OVERVIEW|last=Wright|first=Erik|website=www.ssc.wisc.edu|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, real utopian sociology is the scientific and pragmatic pursuit of studying utopian models for society as it could exist, and pathways to get there.&lt;ref name=wash&gt;{{cite news|title=Thinking Utopian: How about a universal basic income?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/05/11/thinking-utopian-how-about-a-universal-basic-income/?utm_term=.039df752dace|author=Mike Konczal|date=11 May 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=opendem&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/tni/sol-trumbo-vila-nick-buxton/atlas-of-real-utopias|title=An atlas of real utopias?|authors=Sol Trumbo Vila, Nick Buxton|publisher=OpenDemocracy|date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Since 1991 Wright has organized a series of workshop conferences known as ''The Real Utopian Project'' that model the practice of real utopian sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~wright/RealUtopias.htm|title=RealUtopias|last=Wright|first=Erik Olin|website=www.ssc.wisc.edu|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conferences are sponsored by the A.E. Havens Center for Social Justice at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin-Madison]] and structured around “a provocative manuscript that lays out the basic outlines of a radical institutional proposal.”&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; This manuscript is then sent to 15-20 scholars, who write essays on the topic. Prior to the conference these essays are circulated to all the conference participants and then each is discussed at the conference. Following the conference, participants have the opportunity to revise their work before it’s collectively published in Verso’s ''Real Utopias Project'' series; with the exception of papers from the first 1991 conference, which were not published as a series.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

'''Reverse architecture''' is a process of deducing the underlying architecture and design of a system by observing its behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| title=Experience with a reverse architecture approach to increase understanding | work=Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance (ICSM '99) | date=1999 | publisher=[[IEEE]] | doi=10.1109/ICSM.1999.792596 | first1=A. | last1=von Mayrhauser | first2=J. | last2=Wang | first3=Q. | last3=Li }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has its roots in the field of [[reverse engineering]].

Practicing reverse architecture is used to decipher the logistics of building. There are a variety of techniques available, the most notable being [[architecture driven modelling]].{{what|date=January 2018}}{{fact|date=January 2018}}

{{Western dress codes}}

In Western clothing '''semi-formal''' is a grouping of [[Western dress code|dress codes]] indicating the sort of clothes worn to events with a level of [[Etiquette|protocol]] between [[informal attire|informal]] (e.g., [[lounge suit]]) and [[formal wear|formal]].  In the modern era,  an [[Evening gown|evening dress]] or [[cocktail dress]] is customary for women.&lt;ref name="Boswell2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boswell|first=Sandra|title=Protocol Matters|year=2007|publisher=[[Canon Press]]|language=English|isbn=9781591280255|page=181|quote=After-five clothing is a subcategory of semiformal eveningwear. Often called the "cocktail dress," this type of dress if often made of shiny fabric and can be short, from being shorter than knee up to mid-calf, but seldom reaches to the ankle as does stricter semiformal evening wear.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emilypost.com/advice/attire-guide-dress-codes-from-casual-to-white-tie/|title=Attire Guide: Dress Codes from Casual to White Tie - The Emily Post Institute|year=2016|publisher=[[The Emily Post Institute]]|language=English|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether one would choose to wear morning or evening semi-formal has traditionally been defined by whether the event will commence before or after 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.
{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=150

| 
| footer = Woman in [[cocktail dress]]}}

In addition, equivalent versions may be permitted of semi-formally applicable [[ceremonial dress]]es (including [[court dress]]es, [[diplomatic uniform]]s and [[academic dress]]es), [[full dress uniform]]s, [[religious clothing]], and [[national costume]]s, and military [[mess dress]]es.

==Day wear: black lounge suit==
{{main|Black lounge suit}}
In the daytime (before 6 p.m.), the semi-formal code requires for men a black tail-less lounge coat with vertical black and grey stripes or checked [[formal trousers]], with a black waistcoat.  This combination is a less formal version of [[morning dress]], which features a longer, cutaway [[morning coat]].  This semi-formal ensemble is sometimes referred to as a "[[stroller (style)|stroller]]" in [[North America]], or a Marlborough suit in the United Kingdom. Because black was then reserved for formalwear, it was unknown as a color for [[lounge suit]]s, so the term was unambiguous. In the U.K. this mode of dress is now extremely unusual, though some [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] Lodges which meet during the day rather than (as is more common) in the evening do continue to specify it as their dress code. It also still is worn within the legal profession, especially by barristers. Indeed, the striped trousers are in some circles referred to as "barrister trousers".  In [[German language|German]], a stroller is called a ''Stresemann'', after the [[Weimar Republic|German]] foreign secretary [[Gustav Stresemann]]. Stresemann, like other German politicians of his age, wore morning dress or a [[frock coat]] in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] or when making public appearances. However, Stresemann found the long coat impractical for daily work in the Chancellery. To avoid having to change completely, he began to wear the prototype of this jacket at his office, while switching to a morning coat when engaged on more formal business. The style quickly caught on as a more practical variation on morning dress. In [[Japan]], it is known as a "director's suit", from the term ''[[inside director]]''.

==Evening wear: "black tie" dinner suit==
{{main|Black tie|Dinner suit}}
For evening wear (after 6 p.m.), the corresponding code is [[black tie]].&lt;ref name="Flusser02"&gt;{{cite book |last=Flusser |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Flusser |title=Dressing the Man: Mastering the art of Permanent Fashion |publisher=[[HarperCollins|HarperCollins Publishers, Inc.]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBnCNOhoh1sC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Dressing%20the%20Man%3A%20Mastering%20the%20art%20of%20Permanent%20Fashion&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=Dressing%20the%20Man:%20Mastering%20the%20art%20of%20Permanent%20Fashion&amp;f=false |date=2002 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=0-06-019144-9 |page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In formal evening dress, or [[white tie]] dress, this practice of substituting colors in ties is much less common since men's fashion tends to follow tradition more deeply as it becomes more formal.

The origins of evening semi-formal attire date back to the later 19th century when Edward, [[Prince of Wales]] (subsequently [[Edward VII]]), wanted a more comfortable dinner attire than the [[Dress coat|swallowtail coat]].&lt;ref name=Flusser01&gt;{{cite book |last=Flusser |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Flusser |title=Dressing the Man: Mastering the art of Permanent Fashion |publisher=[[HarperCollins|HarperCollins Publishers, Inc.]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBnCNOhoh1sC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Dressing%20the%20Man%3A%20Mastering%20the%20art%20of%20Permanent%20Fashion&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=Dressing%20the%20Man:%20Mastering%20the%20art%20of%20Permanent%20Fashion&amp;f=false |date=2002 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=0-06-019144-9 |page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1886, the Prince invited James Potter, a rich New Yorker, and his wife [[Cora Urquhart Brown-Potter|Cora]] to [[Sandringham House]], the Prince's hunting estate in [[Norfolk]]. When Potter asked for the Prince's dinner dress code, the Prince sent him to his tailor, [[Henry Poole &amp; Co.]], in London, where he was given a suit made to the Prince's specifications with the dinner jacket.&lt;ref name=Flusser03&gt;{{cite book |last=Flusser |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Flusser |title=Dressing the Man: Mastering the art of Permanent Fashion |publisher=[[HarperCollins|HarperCollins Publishers, Inc.]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBnCNOhoh1sC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Dressing%20the%20Man%3A%20Mastering%20the%20art%20of%20Permanent%20Fashion&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=Dressing%20the%20Man:%20Mastering%20the%20art%20of%20Permanent%20Fashion&amp;f=false |date=2002 |location=[[New York City|New York]]|pages=240, 241, 303 |isbn=0-06-019144-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On returning to [[Tuxedo Park, New York]], in 1886, Potter's dinner suit proved popular at the [[Tuxedo Club|Tuxedo Park Club]]. Not long afterward, when a group of men from the club chose to wear such suits to a dinner at [[Delmonico's Restaurant]] in [[New York City]], other diners were surprised. They were told that such clothing was popular at Tuxedo Park, so the particular cut then became known as the "tuxedo".&lt;ref name=Flusser03/&gt;

From its creation into the 1920s, this [[dinner jacket]] was considered appropriate dress for dining in one's home or club, while the tailcoat remained in place as appropriate for public appearance.&lt;ref name= Flusser01/&gt;

Etiquette and clothing experts continue to discourage wearing of black tie as too informal for [[wedding]]s, or indeed any event before 6 p.m.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ford |first1=Charlotte |last2=DeMontravel |first2=Jacqueline |date=2001 |title=21st century etiquette: a guide to manners for the modern age |location= |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books |page=210 |isbn=978-1-56731-629-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as by [[Emily Post]] (1872-1960) and [[Amy Vanderbilt]] (1908-1974). The latter arguing that "no man should ever be caught in a church in a tuxedo."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8778">'''Sensory maps''' are areas of the [[brain]] which respond to sensory [[stimulation]], and are spatially organized according to some feature of the sensory stimulation. In some cases the sensory map is simply a topographic representation of a sensory surface such as the [[skin]], [[cochlea]], or [[retina]]. In other cases it represents other stimulus properties resulting from neuronal computation and is generally ordered in a manner that reflects the periphery. An example is the somatosensory map which is a projection of the skin's surface in the brain that arranges the processing of tactile sensation. This type of somatotopic map is the most common, possibly because it allows for physically neighboring areas of the brain to react to physically similar stimuli in the periphery or because it allows for greater motor control.

The somatosensory cortex is adjacent to the primary motor cortex which is similarly mapped. Sensory maps may play an important role in facilitating motor responses. Other examples of sensory map organization may be that adjacent brain regions are related through proximity of the receptors that they process as in the map of the cochlea in the brain, or that similar features are processed as in the map of the [[feature detectors]] or the retinotopic map, or that time codes are used in organization as in the maps of an owl's sense of direction via interaural time difference between ears. These examples exist in contrast to non-mapped or randomly distributed patterns of processing. An example of a non-mapped sensory processing system is the olfactory system where unrelated odorants are processed side-by-side in the olfactory bulb. In addition to non-mapped and mapped processing, stimuli may be processed under multiple maps as in the human visual system.

==Functions==
Mapped sensory processing areas are a complex phenomenon and must therefore serve an adaptive advantage as it is highly unlikely for complex phenomena to appear otherwise. Sensory maps are also very old in evolutionary history as they are nearly ubiquitous in all species of animals and are found for nearly all sensory systems. Some advantages of sensory maps have been elucidated by scientific exploration:
# '''Filling In''': When sensory stimulation is organized in the brain in some form of topographic pattern, then the animal might be able to “fill in” information that is missing using neighboring regions of the map since they will usually be activated together when all information is present. Loss of signal from one area can be filled in from adjacent areas of the brain if those areas are for physically related parts of the periphery. This is evident in animal studies where the neurons bordering a lesioned, or damaged, brain area (which used to process the sense of touch in a hand) to recover processing of that sensory region because they process information from adjacent hand areas.&lt;ref&gt;Jain, N., Qi, H.X., Collins, C.E., and Kass, J.H. (1989), Large-Scale Reorganization in the Somatosensory Cortex and Thalamus after Sensory Loss in Macaque Monkeys. Journal of Neuroscience. Vol 28(43): 11042–11060&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Lateral Inhibition''': [[Lateral inhibition]] is an organizing principle, it allows contrast in many systems from the visual to the somatosensory. This means that if adjacent areas inhibit one another then stimulation which activates one brain region can simultaneously inhibit the adjoining brain regions to create a sharper resolution between stimuli. This is evident in the visual system of humans where sharp lines can be detected between bright and dark regions because of [[simple cell]]s which inhibit their neighbors.
# '''Summation''': Organization also allows related stimuli to be summed in the neural assessment of sensory information. Examples of this are found in the summation of tactile inputs neurally or visual inputs under low light &lt;ref&gt;Laughlin, S. (1989), The Role of Sensory Adaptation in the Retina. Journal of Experimental Biology. 146, 39-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Topographic Maps===
These maps may be thought of as a mapping of the surface of the body onto the brain structure. Phrased another way, topographic maps are organized in the neural system in a manner that is a projection of the sensory surface onto the brain. This means that the organization in the periphery mirrors the order of the information processing in the brain. This organization can be '''somatotopic''',&lt;ref&gt;Killackey, H.P., Rhoadesb, R.W., Bennet-Clarke, C.A., (1995), The formation of a cortical somatotopic map, Trends in Neurosciences. Vol.18(9), 402-407&lt;/ref&gt; as in the tactile sense of touch, or '''tonotopic''',&lt;ref&gt;Kaltenbach J.A., Czaja J.M., Kaplan CR., (1992), Changes in the tonotopic map of the dorsal cochlear nucleus following induction of cochlear lesions by exposure to intense sound. Hearing Research. 59(2):213-23&lt;/ref&gt; as in the ear, and the retinotopic map which is laid out in the brain as the cells are arranged on the retina.

====Examples====
# [[Wilder Penfield]] &lt;ref&gt;Penfield, W., Rasmussen, T., (1950), The cerebral cortex of man: a clinical study of localization of function, Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; discovered the original topographic map in the form of the internal somatosensory [[Homunculus]]. His work on human neural systems showed that the brain areas that processed tactile sensations are mapped in the same fashion that the body is laid out. This sensory map exaggerates certain regions that have many peripheral sense cells like the lips and hands while reduces the relative space for processing areas with few receptors like the back.
# Hair cells in the auditory system display tonotopic organization.&lt;ref&gt;R.V., Ibrahim, D., and Mount, R.J., (1998), Plasticity of tonotopic maps in auditory midbrain following partial cochlear damage in the developing chinchilla, Experimental Brain Research. Vol 123(4), 1432-1106&lt;/ref&gt; This tonotopic arrangement means that cells are laid out to range from low frequency to high frequency and processed in that same organization within the brain.

===Computational Maps===
These maps are organized entirely in the neural system or organized in a manner not present in the periphery. This can be any map that is constructed by neural computation which is the brain relating two or more bits of information in order to obtain some new information from them. Often these maps involve comparing, as in performing subtraction to get a time delay, two stimuli, like incoming sound information from different ears, in order to produce a valuable new bit of information about those stimuli, as in where they originated. The process just described takes place in the owl's neural system very rapidly.

====Examples====
# The '''Jeffres Map''' was a theory of how the brain might compute interaural time differences (ITD), or differences in time of stimulus arrival between the two ears. Jeffres was famous for producing a theoretical mechanism for making a place map out of timing information, this explained how some animals could appear to have a "look-up map" for where a sound came from. The neural system computes this ITD in the Owl Auditory System and the real neural system was found to almost exactly match the Jeffres Map theory.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, C.E., Konishi, M., (1988), Axonal delay lines for time measurement in the owl's brainstem. Neurobiology. Vol. 85, pp. 8311-8315&lt;/ref&gt; The Jeffres Map shows how ITD signals are used to determine distance and direction in the owl.
# Feature Detectors in a [[visual system]] are another example of computational maps. No part of the physical system in the eyes actually analyzes for features like simple cells in the brain do. This system is well studied in frogs. It is known that frogs detect specific "worm-like" features in their environment and, controlled entirely by the neural system, will lunge at them even if they are a series of white squares in a line imitating a basic worm.&lt;ref&gt;Carew, T.J. (2000), Behavioral neurobiology: The Cellular Organization of Natural Behavior, Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;
# There is also an Frequency Modulation to Frequency Modulation Comparison in the [[Bat]] [[Auditory System]] which is used in echolocation. This FM-FM comparison determines flutter of their target and was made famous in work by Suga.&lt;ref&gt;Suga, N. (1989), Principles of auditory information-processing derived from neuroethology. Journal of Experimental Biology. Vol 146(1): 277-286&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dispute resolution]] is naturally desired, and naturally provided, by forms of inclusive social interaction, such as [[consensus decision-making]], which adapt, but not conveniently,  from a family or tribal model to encompass a global scope.
Current knowledge and discussion about the state of affairs is communicated through the media.

The '''substitution principle''' in sustainability is the maxim that processes, services and products should, wherever possible, be replaced with alternatives which have a lower impact on the environment. An example of a strong, hazard-based interpretation of the principle in application to chemicals is: "that hazardous chemicals should be systematically substituted by less hazardous alternatives or preferably alternatives for which no hazards can be identified".&lt;ref&gt;Greenpeace, (2003, 2005). Safer Chemicals Within Reach: Using the Substitution Principle to drive Green Chemistry. London. p.7 [http://www.cleanproduction.org/library/SafeChem.pdf (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle has historically been promoted by environmental groups. The concept is becoming increasingly mainstream, being a key concept in [[green chemistry]] and a central element of EU [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]] regulation.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission website on REACH. http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/reach/reach_intro.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the principle claim it is very difficult to implement in reality, especially in terms of [[legislation]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Nonetheless, the concept is an important one and a key driver behind identifying Substances of Very High Concern in REACH and the development of hazardous substance lists such as the [http://www.sinlist.org/ SIN List] and the [http://www.etuc.org/a/6023 ETUC Trade Union Priority List]. EU-funded projects such as SubsPort are under development to aid the identification and development of safer substitutes for hazardous chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;Lissner L, Romano D. Substitution for Hazardous Chemicals on an International Level-The Approach of the European Project "SUBSPORT". New Solut. 2011 Jan 1;21(3):477-97. PubMed {{PMID|22001043}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Intifada1990.jpg|thumb|right|A propaganda poster from the [[First Intifada]]]]
[[Terrorism]], in some of its definitions, serves to communicate a message from terrorists to a target audience (TA). By extension, [[symbol]]s play an important role in such communication, through graphics that the organizations use to represent themselves, as well as the meaning and significance behind their choice of targets.&lt;ref name="Terrorism: Communication and Rhetorical Perspectives"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Hair|first=H. Dan|title=Terrorism: Communication and Rhetorical Perspectives|year=2008|publisher=Hampton Press Inc.|location=Cresskill, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism of terrorist groups==
Terrorist organizations use [[graphic]] marks and insignias as symbols to represent their [[ideology]], purpose, and goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=The Trump Enigma|title=International Terrorism Symbol Database|url=http://www.thetrumpenigma.com/islamic-symbols.html|accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These insignias are replete with meaningful [[symbol]]s that communicate the message, purpose, history, and goals of the organizations. As such, they contribute to the creation of unique organizational culture.&lt;ref name="Psychology of Terrorism"&gt;{{cite book|last=Borum|first=Randy|title=Psychology of Terrorism|year=2004|publisher=University of South Florida|location=South Florida|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/208552.PDF |accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few databases exist which catalog the symbols used in terrorist images and propaganda, the most prominent of which are the [[International Terrorist Symbols Database]] and the [[Islamic Imagery Project]]. Also exist the academic research "Terroristica"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=9463|title=Terroristica: Flags and Emblems of Armed Non-Governmental Organizations|last=Zharinov|first=Konstantin|date=|website=www.novapublishers.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

===International Terrorist Symbols Database===
The International Terrorist Symbols Database is a compilation of insignias from terrorist organizations put together by the Anti-Defamation League. Published on their website, it features profiles of thirty different symbols from groups such as [[Al Qaeda in Iraq]], [[Hamas]], [[Hezbollah]], the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]], and others. Not all of the groups discussed are officially recognized on the [[U.S. State Department]]'s Foreign Terrorist Organizations list, yet they all have references to attacks made by the organization. Each image profile contains a description of the insignia, an explanation of the symbols involved, and a detailed history of the organization’s history, ideology, goals, leaders, and major attacks. Below are examples of a few of the terrorist images included in the database, along with the corresponding analysis of the symbols involved in the image.&lt;ref name="International Terrorist Symbols Database"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Terrorist Symbols Database|url=http://www.adl.org/terrorism/symbols/|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=12/02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Al Qaeda in Iraq====

One of several emblems used by Al Qaeda in Iraq, the adjacent image depicts a gray globe positioned in a black background. On top of the globe is an open [[Quran]], from which a rifle, a fist, and a flag emerge. The yellow writing beneath the globe may be translated as "Monotheism and Jihad."

The flag represents Al Qaeda in Iraq's goal of creating an Islamic [[caliphate]],while its color denotes the death and the militant means the organization is willing to take to achieve this goal. The rifle and fist are also symbols of militancy. By positioning these symbols on top of the Quran, the image communicates the foundation of their mission in Islam, while the globe indicates their worldwide ambitions for their goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Terrorist Symbols Database-- Al Qaeda in Iraq|url=http://www.adl.org/terrorism/symbols/al_qaeda_iraq.asp|accessdate=12/01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The color green has represented Islam since its founding. Consequently, the green coloring of the central image indicates the organization's tie to Islam. Similar to the symbolism used by Al Qaeda in Iraq, the rifle represents commitment to militancy, while the globe indicates international involvement and ambition for their goals. The Quran indicates both a foundation in Islam, and their goal to found an Islamic state that encompasses Lebanon and Israel. Finally, the Islamic verse, which is from the Quran, bolsters support for their activities by citing a verse that celebrates and supports those who fight for Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Terrorist Symbols Database -- Hezbollah|url=http://www.adl.org/terrorism/symbols/hezbollah.asp|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=12/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The database does not analyze the symbolism of the seven-leafed branch,

====Muslim Brotherhood====

The emblem of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] depicts two cross swords beneath a red Quran, both of which are placed within a green circle that sits in a brown square. Inscribed on the Quran is the phrase, "Truly, it is a generous Quran." Below the swords reads, "Be Prepared."

Once again, the color green, as well as the presence of a Quran, symbolizes the foundation of the Muslim Brotherhood in [[Islam]]. The presence of swords indicate militancy, yet the choice to use them in the place of guns symbolizes the Muslim Brotherhood's connection to the historic Islam. The motto "Be Prepared" references a verse in the Quran that warns Muslims to be prepared to fight enemies of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Terrorist Symbols Database|url=http://www.adl.org/terrorism/symbols/muslim_brotherhood_1.asp|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=12/1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123121653/http://adl.org/terrorism/symbols/muslim_brotherhood_1.asp|archivedate=2013-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis does not discuss the quote on the Quran.

====Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam====

The central figure of the image is a yellow tiger, which is surrounded by a ring of bullets and crossed by two rifles. The script both around the tiger, in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and below the tiger, in English, reads "[[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]]."

[[Eelam]] is Tamil for the Island of Sri Lanka, which the groups seeks to liberate from the control of the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] majority. The tiger is a culturally important animal that symbolizes heroism, militancy, and patriotism. Its centrality in this image indicates the desire of the Liberation Tigers to be self-determined and independent. The bullets and rifles indicate their employment of violence as the means to achieve these goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Terrorist Symbols Database -- Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam|url=http://www.adl.org/terrorism/symbols/liberation_tigers_te2.asp|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=12/1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123121540/http://adl.org/terrorism/symbols/liberation_tigers_te2.asp|archivedate=2013-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Islamic Imagery Project===
The Islamic Imagery Project is a report published in 2006 by the [[Combating Terrorism Center]], a division of the Department of Social Sciences at the [[United States Military Academy]]. At the most basic level, the report is meant to be a practical exploration of the meaning of various jihadi symbols in order to better understand, and counteract, jihadi thought and the influence of these organizations. The forward to the report cites the powerful role “pictures, motifs, and images,” as well as the emotions they evoke, play in gaining a better understanding of the message and purpose of [[jihad]] terrorist groups.&lt;ref name="The Islamic Imagery Project"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Islamic Imagery Project|year=2006|publisher=Combating Terrorism Center at West Point|location=West Point, NY|url=http://www.ctc.usma.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The preface explains that the authors intend to extend the study of imagery beyond the realm of art history, into modern symbols of violent jihadi groups, which they cite as the primary method these groups promote and reinforce their ideologies:

“Visual motifs accomplish several objectives for jihadi propagandists. First, they create a mental conception of reality for their audiences. The use of carefully edited images evokes existing emotional or historical memories, eliciting an emotional response that may be conscious or subconscious…. Secondly, they help the author, or propagandist, communicate a message, which is often a visual argument for something or against something. Texts and language, including imagery, provide interactive ways for jihadis to engage the ideology itself.”&lt;ref name="The Islamic Imagery Project"/&gt;

Critics of the project have deemed it oversimplified, arguing that much more study has yet to go into a symbolic analysis of terrorist imagery.&lt;ref name="Violent Jihadi Imagery Muslim Observer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cook|first=Geoffrey|title=Violent Jihadi Imagery|url=http://muslimmedianetwork.com/mmn/?p=4373|accessdate=5 December 2011|newspaper=The Muslim Observer|date=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have deemed it the best interpretation, in English, of imagery used by terrorist groups.&lt;ref name="The Changing Character of War"&gt;{{cite book|last=Strachan|first=Hew|title=The Changing Character of War|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document is a catalog of the 100 most common motifs in jihadist visual propaganda that the Combating Terrorism Center deemed significant. These motifs are sorted into five categories: Nature; Geography, Political Symbols, and States; People; Weapons, Warfare, and the Afterlife; Other. An example of a symbol from each category is provided below.

====Nature: the Moon====

The moon is an extremely important symbol in Islam which has astrological, religious, and spiritual significance. Jihadi imagery typically simplifies this complex symbol, using to evoke the notion of the divine and a connection to Islamic identity and, for full moons in particular, the afterlife. When paired with images that reference martyrdom, the moon suggests that there will be a heavenly reward for the martyr. In the example image on the right, the presence of a white horse and clouds around the man's portrait indicate that he is a martyr, and the moon evokes the benefit he will gain for his sacrifice in heaven.&lt;ref name="The Islamic Imagery Project" /&gt;

====Geography, Political Symbols, and States: Inverted Currency====

Inverted currency is a symbol that seeks to undermine typical power structures of Western countries. Currency is understood by many terrorist groups to represent Western materialism, power, and dominance. It is also an extremely powerful cultural symbol in the West, one that is closely tied to the national identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lauer|first=Josh|title=Money as Mass Communication: U.S. Paper Currency and the Iconography of Nationalism|journal=The Communication Review|date=May 2008|volume=11|issue=2|pages=109–132|url=http://www.tandfonline.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/full/10.1080/10714420802068359|doi=10.1080/10714420802068359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the inversion of currency by terrorist groups, as seen in the example at right, is a symbolic way of transferring the power of Western nations to the terrorists. By replacing Benjamin Franklin with Osama Bin Laden, the image seeks to symbolically argue that Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda have the power to undermine basic sources of American power, and turn the United States against itself.&lt;ref name="The Islamic Imagery Project" /&gt;

====People: Women====

Woman are commonly a symbol of masculine honor, pride, and purity. They are often depicted as innocent victims that jihadi efforts need to protect from dominance and abuse by the West or other enemies. Often, women are depicted in images as innocent and helpless victims of anti-Muslim oppression, and in need of protection. The intended effect is to create a sense of anger and need to protect one's pride and honor, in order to spur the audience to anger supporting or aiding the jihadi movements. Women are also portrayed as martyrs, in order to make Muslim men feel a sense of shame and oppression that their women are forced to fight against an oppressive force. In this way, it serves to shame men into action as much as it celebrates the sacrifice of the women martyrs.&lt;ref name="The Islamic Imagery Project" /&gt;

====Weapons, Warfare, and the Afterlife: Modern Weapons====

Modern [[weapons]] reinforce the violent nature of jihadi warfare and symbolize the use of military technology to gain power and accomplish goals. The Islamic Imagery Project argues that depictions of modern weapons often serve to exaggerate the military technology contained by jihadi groups. They also serve as symbols for modern jihadi victories, such as the defeat of the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Afghanistan]], reminders that jihad resistance can overcome Western military dominance. Individuals pose with them to represent their association with and loyalty to the jihad movement, and helps them to construct their identities as participants in jihad. As such, they are understood as heroic symbols of participation in resistance to anti-Muslim oppression.

====Other: Clasped Hands====

A depiction of clasped hands symbolizes unity among the various jihadi groups and the Muslim community at large. The first example, at the right of the page, is an image published by Al Qaeda that uses handshakes to depict unity between Al Qaeda and other jihadi groups, creating a symbolic connection that ties various branches of the jihadi movement together. The clasped hands in the second example illustrate unity of the Muslim community as a whole. Each of the arms is a slightly different shade, representing the desire to bring the mission to bring the mission of specific jihad movements, which are often nation-based, to the international Muslim community.&lt;ref name="The Islamic Imagery Project" /&gt;

==Symbolism of target choice==
Terrorist acts may be considered a form of communication with victims, spectators, and the perpetrators.&lt;ref name="Terrorism as Communication"&gt;{{cite web|last=Decker|first=Warren|title=Terrorism as Communication|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED196091.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attacks often are not interpreted simply as violent acts, but as statements that communicate a specific intended message. Since the rhetoric is largely non-verbal (though many terrorist attacks are followed by claims of responsibility and explanation), symbols play an important role in creating meaningful messages, and consequently become central to the mission and effectiveness of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Psychology of Terrorism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Understanding Terrorism: Challenges, Perspectives, and Issues"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Gus|title=Understanding Terrorism: Challenges, Perspectives, and Issues|year=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Targets are strategically chosen to both destroy and create symbols that communicate a desired message and create an effect on the audience.  O'Hair and Heath argue that "selection of the targets of terrorism is strategic, made because of their potential rhetorical impact.”   &lt;ref name="From the Eyes of the Beholder"&gt;{{cite book|title=Terrorism: Communication and Rhetorical Perspectives|year=2008|publisher=Hampton Press|location=Cresskill, NJ|author=Robert Heath |author2=Dan O'Hair}}&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective is reinforced in the book "Understanding Terrorism: Challenges, Perspectives, and Issues," in which Gus Martin argues that "terrorists select their targets because of their symbolic and propaganda value. High-profile, sentimental, or otherwise significant targets are chosen with the expectation that the target's constituency will be moved and that the victims' audience will in some way suffer." &lt;ref name="Understanding Terrorism: Challenges, Perspectives, and Issues" /&gt; Locations are chosen because of the symbolism they already contain, and the ability of the terrorist group to manipulate this symbolism through an attack.

The symbolic choices of terrorist targets are not only meant to send isolated messages, but reflect the greater symbolic rhetoric of terrorism in general. Terrorism, it has been argued, refutes the strategy of gaining ideological victory through a single act. Instead, "the rhetorical stance of terrorism... is patient, the chipping away at the symbolic or ideological foundation of its targets.”   &lt;ref name="From the Eyes of the Beholder"/&gt; Each target is strategically chosen to fit into the greater message.

By carefully selecting targets, terrorists use acts of destruction to both destroy and create cultural symbols that promote fear and compliance among their target audience, and that often communicate specific ideological messages.&lt;ref name="Terrorism: Communication and Rhetorical Perspectives" /&gt; For example, in their book ''Terrorism: Communication and Rhetorical Perspective'', O'Hair et al. describe the choice of the World Trade Center towers as a target for the 9/11 attack: "The Twin towers of the WTC stood as the very image of globalization, capitalism, and Western economic superiority... their collapse both exposed and symbolized 'the vulnerability of governmental power (Juergensemeyer, 2001, pg. 32), and the fragile nature of the dominant cultural worldview." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Hair|first=H. Dan|title=Terrorism: Communication and Rhetorical Perspectives|year=2008|publisher=Hampton Press Inc.|location=Cresskill, NJ|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===September 11th===

The effectiveness of the World Trade Center towers as a symbol is apparent in the discussion that continues about them today.&lt;ref name="9/11's Most Controversial Photo"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Jonathan|title=The meaning of 9/11's most controversial photo|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/02/911-photo-thomas-hoepker-meaning?fb_source=tickerdialog_multiline&amp;fb_action_types=news.reads&amp;fb_action_ids=10150869560575104&amp;fb_ref=U-GCfNziF1gfnn4uPSIKY2dW-CFCONX01FRS-3xj66XXX|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=23 October 2011|location=London|date=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many argue they were chosen because the towers represent Western power, wealth, commerce, and materialism.&lt;ref name="From the Eyes of the Beholder" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nouriani Winter 2011 19–30"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nouriani|first=D. Steven|title=The Defensive Misappropriation and Corruption of Cultural Symbols|journal=Jung Journal: Culture and Psyche|date=Winter 2011|volume=5|issue=1|pages=19–30|doi=10.1525/jung.2011.5.1.19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not just the activities they represent, but also their stature, made them a good target. The towers dominated the New York City skyline, making their loss, and the symbolic destruction of American commerce and power, all the more visible.&lt;ref name="Nouriani Winter 2011 19–30"/&gt; Similarly, the Pentagon was a strategic target because of its symbolism as the branch of the American government which protects the country.&lt;ref name="Understanding Terrorism: Challenges, Perspectives, and Issues" /&gt; The terrorists behind 9/11 sought to undermine these greater themes of American life by attacking the symbols that embody them.&lt;ref name="Understanding Terrorism: Challenges, Perspectives, and Issues" /&gt;&lt;ref name="From the Eyes of the Beholder" /&gt;

Upon their destruction, the World Trade Center towers did not cease to exist as an important cultural symbol. In their book ''Defining Visual Rhetorics'', Charles Hill and Margeurite Helmers discuss the revision of the symbolism of the towers upon their destruction: "Strong national symbols such as the eagle and the flag are liberally in use in the popular and mass media as a means of gathering together the imagined national community, and to these patriotic and sentimental images the twin towers of the World Trade Center have been added in the way that the red poppy came to symbolize the First World War." &lt;ref name="Defining Visual Rhetorics"&gt;{{cite book|title=Defining Visual Rhetorics|year=2004|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|author1=Hill, Charles |author2= Margeurite Helmers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Oklahoma City Bombing===

[[File:Oklahoma City National Memorial 4886.jpg|thumb|Oklahoma City National Memorial]]

The [[Oklahoma City bombing]] is another terrorist attack that has become highly symbolic in the American psyche. As a member of the [[Patriot Movement]], and fearing a [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]], the choice of the Oklahoma City Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building by Timothy McVeigh was meant to convey a message of resistance to the federal government. McVeigh sought to undermine the role of the Federal Government in society by visually destroying its presence.&lt;ref name="Understanding Terrorism: Challenges, Perspectives, and Issues" /&gt;

Discussion of symbolism as it relates to the Oklahoma City Bombing now centers around symbols of hope, healing, and recovery. After the bombing, city planners carefully considered what to do with the remains of the building because of the importance it had to the public as a place were many were killed. Some referred to it as “sacred ground.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Linenthal|first=Edward|title=The Unfinished Bombing: Oklahoma City in American Memory|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial, called the “Outdoor Symbolic Memorial” was built on the site. Several monuments make up the memorial: the Gates of Time, which depicts “the innocence of the city before the attack… and the hope that came from the horror in the moments and days following the attack”; the Field of Empty chairs, which lies on the footprint of the building, and is made up of 168 chairs to represent each of the victims; the Survivor tree, a tree which bore the full brunt of the attack and remained standing, transforming it into “a living symbol of resilience.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Symbolism|url=http://www.oklahomacitynationalmemorial.org/secondary.php?section=2&amp;catid=30|publisher=Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220104853/http://www.oklahomacitynationalmemorial.org/secondary.php?section=2&amp;catid=30|archivedate=2009-02-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite McVeigh’s intentions to make the Alfred P. Murrah building a visual depiction of the destruction of government, it, along with the public's response to the bombing, has been transformed by the public into a symbol of recovery and healing. Though terrorism seeks to create symbols, their meaning may be changed by similarly symbolic rhetoric created by the victims of the original attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oklahoma City : After the Bomb: Symbol of Healing|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-30/news/mn-60677_1_oklahoma-city-bomb | work=Los Angeles Times | date=30 April 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Symbols of Hope|url=http://www.classbrain.com/artmonument/publish/oklahoma_city_bombing.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The psychology of symbols==

Psychology discusses the effect of symbols on the human mind, and gives insight into why the rhetoric of terrorism may be conducted partly through symbols. An overview of the psychology of symbols is relevant to terrorism because it is in the mind that symbols find validation and reality, allowing terrorist attacks create an effect on a wide audience.&lt;ref name="Defining Visual Rhetorics" /&gt;

The influence of images on humans has long been studied by art historians. [[David Freedberg]], argues that humans react to images not simply on a cognitive level, but on an emotional one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freedberg|first=David|title=The Power of Images: Studies in the history and theory of response|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the  psychology of persuasion has noted that if people see a symbol of authority, even if they know  the groups or person projecting the symbol has no actual authority, they begin to believe that there is real authority in that party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Robert|title=The Power of Persuasion: How We're Bought and Sold|year=2003|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these theories contribute to arguments scholars make about the role of psychology in terrorism by helping to explain why humans react to terrorist attacks.

Psychology also contributes to the understanding of how visual propaganda put forward by terrorist groups contributes to their organization. In the book, “Psychology of Terrorism,” author [[Randy Borum]] argues that projecting an image of solidarity and power makes terrorist groups more attractive as social collectives, even if the person joining the group does not at the outset believe in its ideology. A sense of belonging is one of the primary motivating factors for people joining terrorist groups.&lt;ref name="Psychology of Terrorism" /&gt; Many symbols cited by the Islamic Imagery Project and the International Terrorist Symbols Database reference this notion of community or belonging.&lt;ref name="International Terrorist Symbols Database" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Islamic Imagery Project" /&gt;

==The role of the media==

"The communications media, whether consciously or otherwise, has well served the terrorist cause. Political terrorism is now viewed as an instant means of communication and is aided and abetted by contemporary technology, utilizing the dramatic force of the mass media." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedlander|first=Robert A.|title=Coping with Terrorism: What is to be done?|journal=Terrorism: Theory and Practice|year=1979|series=Westview Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media plays a large role in communicating information about terrorist attacks, and consequently contributes to the propagation of attacks as symbols. Through television, the internet, newspapers, and journals, the media allows the general population to witness terrorism as it occurs, which some have argued makes it iconic and creates an odd fixation on terrorism within the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Der Derian|first=James|title=Imaging Terror: Logos, Pathos, and Ethos|journal=Third World Quarterly|year=2005|volume=26|issue=1|doi=10.1080/0143659042000322883 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrorism is a topic that fits well into the demands of the news industry. [[Russell Farnen]] notes that, “Terrorism is different, dramatic, and potentially violent. It frequently develops over a period of time, occurs in exotic locations, offers a clear confrontation, involves bizarre characters, and is politically noteworthy. Finally, it is of concern to the public.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farnen|first=Russell|title=Terrorism and the Mass Media: A systematic analysis of a symbiotic process|journal=Terrorism|year=1990|volume=13|pages=99–123|doi=10.1080/10576109008435820}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that the attention paid to these attacks only gives them credence and power they don’t deserve: “Without massive news coverage the terrorist act would resemble the proverbial tree falling in the forest: if no one learned of an incident, it would be as if it had not occurred.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nacos|first=Brigitte|title=Accomplice or Witness? The media's role in terrorism|journal=Current History|pages=174–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18160">'''Teleonomy''' is the quality of apparent purposefulness and goal-directedness of structures and functions in living organisms brought about by the exercise, augmentation, and, improvement of reasoning. The term derives from two [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words, τέλος ''telos'' ("end, purpose") and νόμος ''nomos'' ("law"), and means "end-directed"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/lynnhank/Mayr3.pdf |title=The Multiple Meanings of "Teleological" |last=Mayr |first=Ernst |date=1974 |journal=Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; (literally "purpose-law"). Teleonomy is sometimes contrasted with [[teleology in biology|teleology]], where the latter is understood as a purposeful goal-directedness brought about through human or divine intention. Teleonomy is thought to derive from [[evolution]]ary history, adaptation for reproductive success, and/or the operation of a program.  Teleonomy is related to programmatic or computational aspects of purpose.

== Relationship with teleology ==
{{further|Teleology in biology}}

[[Colin Pittendrigh]], who coined the term in 1958, applied it to biological phenomena that appear to be end-directed, hoping to limit the much older term [[teleology in biology|teleology]] to actions planned by an agent who can internally model alternative futures with [[intention]], purpose and foresight:
{{quote|Biologists for a while were prepared to say a turtle came ashore and laid its eggs. These verbal scruples were intended as a rejection of teleology but were based on the mistaken view that the efficiency of final causes is necessarily implied by the simple description of an end-directed mechanism. … The biologists long-standing confusion would be removed if all end-directed systems were described by some other term, e.g., 'teleonomic', in order to emphasize that recognition and description of end-directedness does not carry a commitment to Aristotelian teleology as an efficient causal principle.&lt;ref&gt;Pittendrigh, C. S.  "Adaptation, natural selection, and behavior", in ''Behavior and Evolution'', ed. A. Roe and [[George Gaylord Simpson]], New Haven: Yale University Press, 1958, 390–416; p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1965 [[Ernst Mayr]] cited Pittendrigh and criticized him for not making a "clear distinction between the two teleologies of Aristotle"; evolution involves Aristotle's [[material cause]]s and [[formal cause]]s rather than [[efficient cause]]s.&lt;ref name="causeandeffect"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mayr, Ernst |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |chapter=Cause and effect in biology |editor=Lerner, D. |title=Cause and effect |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |date=1965 |pages=33–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mayr adopted Pittendrigh's term, but supplied his own definition:{{quote|It would seem useful to rigidly restrict the term ''teleonomic'' to systems operating on the basis of a program of coded information. (p.42)}}

[[Richard Dawkins]] described the properties of "archeo-purpose" (by natural selection) and "neo-purpose" (by evolved adaptation) in his talk on the "Purpose of Purpose". Dawkins attributes the brain's flexibility as an evolutionary feature in adapting or subverting goals to making neo-purpose goals on an overarching evolutionary archeo-purpose. Language allows groups to share neo-purposes, and cultural evolution - occurring much faster than natural evolution - can lead to conflict or collaborations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://old.richarddawkins.net/videos/3956-the-purpose-of-purpose |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121222125/http://old.richarddawkins.net/videos/3956-the-purpose-of-purpose |archivedate=2014-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[behavior analysis]], Hayne Reese made the [[adverbial]] distinction between purposefulness (having an internal determination) and purposiveness (serving or effecting a useful function).  Reese implies that non-teleological statements are called teleonomic when they represent an "if A then C" phenomenon's [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]]; where, teleology is a [[consequent]] representation. The concept of purpose, as only being the teleology final cause, requires supposedly impossible [[Temporal paradox|time reversal]]; because, the future consequent determines the present antecedent.  Purpose, as being both in the beginning and the end, simply rejects teleology, and addresses the time reversal problem. In this, Reese sees no value for teleology and teleonomic concepts in behavior analysis; however, the concept of purpose preserved in process can be useful, if not reified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2733687/pdf/behavan00023-0077.pdf | title=Teleology and Teleonomy in Behavior Analysis | author=Reese, Hayne W. | journal=The Behavior Analyst | date=1994 | volume=17 | issue=1 | pages=75–91 | pmc=2733687 | pmid=22478174}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theoretical time-dimensional tunneling and teleological functioning of [[temporal paradox]] would also fit this description without the necessity of a localized intelligence.  Whereas the concept of a teleonomic process, such as [[evolution]], can simply refer to a system capable of producing complex products without the benefit of a guiding foresight.

In 1966 [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] approved of the term in the last chapter of his ''Adaptation and Natural Selection; a critique of some current evolutionary thought''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Williams, G.C. |title=Adaptation and natural selection; a critique of some current evolutionary thought |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |location=Princeton, NJ |date=1966 |isbn=0-691-02615-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, [[Jacques Monod]], in ''[[Chance and Necessity]], an Essay on the Natural Philosophy of Modern Biology'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Monod, Jacques |title=Chance and Necessity: An Essay on the Natural Philosophy of Modern Biology |publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]] |location=New York |date=1971 |isbn=0-394-46615-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested teleonomy as a key feature that defines life:

{{quote|Rather than reject this [goal-directedness] idea (as certain biologists have tried to do) it is indispensable to recognise that it is essential to the very definition of living beings. We shall maintain that the latter are distinct from all other structures or systems present in the universe through this characteristic property, which we shall call teleonomy.
[..] It will be readily seen that, in this or that species situated higher or lower on the animal scale, the achievement of the fundamental teleonomic project (i.e., invariant reproduction) calls assorted, more or less elaborate and complex structures and performances into play. The fact must be stressed that concerned here are not only the activities directly bound up with reproduction itself, but all those that contribute-be it very indirectly-to the species' survival and multiplication. For example, in higher mammals the play of the young is an important element of psychic development and social integration. Therefore this activity has teleonomic value, inasmuch as it furthers the cohesion of the group, a condition for its survival and for the expansion of the species.}}

In 1974 Ernst Mayr illustrated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mayr, E. |title=Teleological and Teleonomic, a New Analysis |journal=Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science |volume=14 |date=1974 |doi=10.1007/978-94-009-5345-1_10 |pages=133–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; the difference in the statements:

:: "The Wood Thrush migrates in the fall '''in order to escape''' the inclemency of the weather and the food shortages of the northern climates."

:: "The Wood Thrush migrates in the fall '''and thereby escapes''' the inclemency of the weather and the food shortages of the northern climates."

{{quote|If we replace the words ‘in order to escape’ by ‘and thereby escapes’, we leave the important question unanswered as to why the Wood Thrush migrates. The teleonomic form of the statement implies that the goal-directed migratory activity is governed by a program. By omitting this important message the second sentence is greatly impoverished as far as information content is concerned, without gaining in causal strength.}}

Subsequently, philosophers like [[Ernest Nagel]] further analysed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2025745 |author=Nagel, E. |title=Teleology Revisited: Goal-Directed Processes in Biology |jstor=2025745 |journal=Journal of Philosophy |volume=74 |issue=5 |pages=261–301 |date=1977 }} Reprinted in Allen, Bekoff &amp; Lauder, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of goal-directedness in biology and by 1982, philosopher and historian of science [[David Hull]] joked&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hull, D.L. |chapter=Philosophy and Biology |title=Philosophy of Science |pages=280–316 |volume=2 |editor=Fløistad, Guttorm |editor-link=Guttorm Fløistad |series=Contemporary Philosophy: A New Survey |publisher=Nijhoff |location=Hague |date=1982 |isbn=90-247-2518-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; about the use of teleology and teleonomy by biologists:

{{quote|Haldane [in the 1930s] can be found remarking, ‘Teleology is like a mistress to a biologist: he cannot live without her but he’s unwilling to be seen with her in public.’ Today the mistress has become a lawfully wedded wife. Biologists no longer feel obligated to apologize for their use of teleological language; they flaunt it. The only concession which they make to its disreputable past is to rename it ‘teleonomy’.}}

==Relationship to evolution==

The concept of teleonomy was largely developed by Mayr and Pittendrigh to separate biological evolution from teleology.  Pittendrigh's purpose was to enable biologists who had become overly cautious about goal-oriented language to have a way of discussing the goals and orientations of an organism's behaviors without inadvertently invoking teleology.  Mayr was even more explicit, saying that while teleonomy certainly operates on the level of organisms, the process of evolution itself is necessarily non-teleonomic.

{{quote|Mayr says, 'The existence of complex codes of information in the DNA of the germ plasm permits teleonomic purposiveness. On the other hand, evolutionary research has found no evidence whatsoever for a "goal-seeking" of evolutionary lines, as postulated in that kind of teleology which sees "plan and design" in nature. The harmony of the living universe, so far as it exists, is an a posteriori product of natural selection.&lt;ref name="causeandeffect" /&gt;}} This attitude towards the role of teleonomy in the evolutionary process is the consensus view of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3998/ptb.6959004.0002.003 |author=Merlin, F. |title=Evolutionary Chance Mutation: A Defense of the Modern Synthesis’ Consensus View |journal=Philosophy, Theory, and Practice in Biology |volume=2 |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolution largely hoards [[hindsight]], as variations unwittingly make "predictions" about structures and functions which could successfully cope with the future, and which participate in a process of natural selection that culls the unfit, leaving the fit to the next generation.  Information accumulates about functions and structures that are successful, exploiting [[feedback]] from the environment via the selection of fitter coalitions of structures and functions. [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]] has described these features as an [[anticipatory system]] which builds an internal model based on past and possible future states.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In 1962, Grace A. de Laguna's "The Role of Teleonomy in Evolution" attempted to show how different stages of evolution were characterized by different types of teleonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/287855 |author=de Laguna |author2=Grace A. |title=The Role of Teleonomy in Evolution |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=117–131 |date=April 1962 |jstor=186539}}&lt;/ref&gt; de Laguna points out that humans have oriented teleonomy so that the teleonomic goal is not restricted to the reproduction of humans, but also to cultural ideals.

In recent years, a few biologists believe that the separation of teleonomy from the process of evolution has gone too far.  [[Peter Corning]] notes that behavior, which is a teleonomic trait, is responsible for the construction of biological niches, which is an agent of selection.  Therefore, it would be inaccurate to say that there was no role for teleonomy in the process of evolution, since teleonomy dictates the fitness landscape according to which organisms are selected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/bij.12061 |author=Corning, P. |title=Evolution ‘on purpose’: how behaviour has shaped the evolutionary process |journal=Journal of the Linnaean Society |volume=112 |pages=242–260 |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holmes, B. |title=Life’s purpose: Can animals guide their own evolution? |journal=New Scientist |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Corning calls this phenomenon "teleonomic selection".

==Philosophy==
In teleology, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s positions as expressed in [[Critique of Judgment]], were neglected for many years because in the minds of many scientists they were associated with [[Vitalism|vitalist]] views of evolution. Their recent rehabilitation is evident in teleonomy, which bears a number of features, such as the description of organisms, that are reminiscent of the Aristotelian conception of [[final cause]]s as essentially recursive in nature. Kant's position is that, even though we cannot know whether there are final causes in nature, we are constrained by the peculiar nature of the human understanding to view organisms teleologically. Thus the Kantian view sees teleology as a necessary principle for the study of organisms, but only as a regulative principle, and with no ontological implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Purpose |last=Huneman |first=Philippe |date=2007 |publisher=University of Rochester Press |isbn= 1-58046-265-0 |pages= 1–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Talcott Parsons]], in the later part of his working with a theory of [[social evolution]] and a related theory of world-history, adopted the concept of teleonomy as the fundamental organizing principle for directional processes and his theory of [[social development|societal development]] in general. In this way, Parsons tried to find a theoretical compromise between [[Voluntarism (action)|voluntarism]] as a principle of action and the idea of a certain directionality in history.

==Current status==
Teleonomy is closely related to concepts of [[emergence]], [[Complex systems|complexity theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00128784 |author=Christensen, W.D. |title=A complex systems theory of teleology |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=11 |pages=301–320 |date=1996 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/N065P12442750447.pdf |format=PDF |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[self-organizing systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0301-4622(87)80031-5 |author=Lifson S |title=Chemical selection, diversity, teleonomy and the second law of thermodynamics.

"'''The Most Dangerous Game'''", also published as "'''The Hounds of Zaroff'''"{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}, is a [[short story]] by [[Richard Connell]], first published in ''[[Collier's]]'' on January 19, 1924. The story features a [[big-game hunter]] from [[New York City]] who falls off a [[yacht]] and swims to what seems to be an abandoned and isolated [[island]] in the [[Caribbean]], where he is hunted by a Russian aristocrat. The story is inspired by the big-game hunting [[safari]]s in [[Africa]] and [[South America]] that were particularly fashionable among wealthy Americans in the 1920s.

The story has been adapted numerous times, most notably as the 1932 [[RKO Pictures]] film ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'', starring [[Joel McCrea]] and [[Leslie Banks]], and for a 1943 episode of the [[CBS Radio]] series ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]'', starring [[Orson Welles]].

==Plot Summary==
Sanger Rainsford and his friend, Whitney, are traveling to the [[Amazon rainforest]] to hunt the region's big cat: the [[jaguar]]. After a discussion about how they are "the hunters" instead of "the hunted", Whitney goes to bed and Rainsford hears gunshots. He climbs onto the yacht's rail and accidentally falls overboard, swimming to Ship-Trap Island, which is notorious for shipwrecks. On the island, he finds a palatial chateau inhabited by two [[Cossack]]s: the owner, General Zaroff, and his gigantic [[deaf-mute]] servant, Ivan.

Zaroff, another big-game hunter, knows of Rainsford from his published account of hunting [[snow leopard]]s in [[Tibet]]. After inviting him to dinner, General Zaroff tells Rainsford he is bored of hunting because it no longer challenges him; he has moved to Ship-Trap in order to capture shipwrecked sailors. Any captives who can elude Zaroff, Ivan, and a pack of [[hunting dog]]s for three days are set free. Zaroff reveals that no one has lasted that long, although a couple of sailors had come close. Zaroff also says that he offers sailors a "choice"; should they decline to be hunted they will be handed over to Ivan, who had once been official [[Knout|knouter]] for [[Nicholas II|The Great White Czar]]. Rainsford denounces this as barbarism. Zaroff reacts in a cosmopolitan manner that "[[survival of the fittest|life is for the strong]]". Realizing he has no way out, Rainsford reluctantly agrees to be hunted.

During his three-hour head start, Rainsford lays an intricate trail in the forest and then climbs a tree. Zaroff finds him easily, but decides to play with him like a cat would a mouse, standing underneath the tree Rainsford is hiding in, smoking a cigarette, and then abruptly departing. After the failed attempt at eluding Zaroff, Rainsford builds a Malay man-catcher, a [[Deadfall trap|weighted log attached to a trigger]]. This contraption injures Zaroff's shoulder, causing him to return home for the night. The next day Rainsford creates a [[Trapping pit|Burmese tiger pit]], which kills one of Zaroff's hounds. He sacrifices his knife and ties it to a sapling to make a [[Uganda]]n knife trap; Ivan is killed when he stumbles into this trap and the knife plunges into his heart. To escape Zaroff and his approaching hounds, Rainsford dives off a cliff into the sea; Zaroff, disappointed at Rainsford's suicide, returns home. 

Zaroff locks himself in his bedroom and turns on the lights only to find Rainsford waiting for him; he had swum around the island in order to sneak into the chateau without the dogs finding him. Zaroff congratulates him on winning the "game", but Rainsford decides to fight him, saying he is still a beast-at-bay and that the original hunt is not over. Accepting the challenge, Zaroff says that the loser will be fed to the dogs, while the winner will sleep in his bed. Though the ensuing fight is not described, the story ends with Rainsford observing that "he had never slept in a better bed"—implying that he defeated and killed Zaroff.

==Analysis==
"The Most Dangerous Game" is a popular read within middle and high school curricula due to the strength of the themes within the story. The first and foremost question that the story bears is that of justifiable murder. Rainsford justifies his hunting of animals because he believes that man is superior to animals because animals do not feel. To contradict, General Zaroff believes that men are superior because they are able to reason. Zaroff uses his reasoning to explain why men are the most interesting game to hunt; men can reason, and thus provide a challenge that no animal can contend with. The story simultaneously highlights through the experience of Rainsford, as he is hunted, the fears that animals must experience while being hunted.

Zaroff himself is a contradiction because his exquisite manners are juxtaposed with his heartless brutality in killing men. The idea of a man who is proper in all aspects, but still contains a desire to kill, is a suggestion by Connell that men possess murderous instincts that can only be subdued by the presence of society and law. Zaroff is only able to partake in his "hobby" because he does not live within a civilization.

The ending of the story bears questions about the true nature of Rainsford, who is implied to have killed Zaroff in order to secure his own safety. By killing Zaroff, he thus took part in the "game" that Zaroff wanted him to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.enotes.com/topics/most-dangerous-game/themes|title=The Most Dangerous Game Themes |publisher=eNotes|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations and in popular culture==
[[File:Most Dangerous Game poster.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Theatrical release poster for ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'' (1932)]]

===Film===
This story has been adapted to film numerous times. The most significant of these adaptations—and the only film to use the original characters—was [[RKO Pictures]]' film released in [[1932 in film|1932]], ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]''. [[Joel McCrea]] stars as Rainsford; [[Leslie Banks]] portrays Zaroff. The adaptation by [[James Ashmore Creelman]] adds two other principal characters, brother-and-sister pair Eve Trowbridge ([[Fay Wray]]) and Martin Trowbridge ([[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]]), who are castaways from a shipwreck. ''The Most Dangerous Game'' was co-directed by [[Ernest B. Schoedsack]] and [[Irving Pichel]]; also with a score by [[Max Steiner]], the film was a favorite project of producer [[Merian C. Cooper]]. The production shared several sets with ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933), a simultaneous RKO project that also involved Schoedsack, Cooper, Wray, Armstrong, Creelman, and Steiner. ''The Most Dangerous Game'' was a modest success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&amp;Movie=3937 |title=The Most Dangerous Game  |publisher=''AFI Catalog of Feature Films'' |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RKO Story"&gt;Jewell, Richard B., ''The RKO Story''. New Rochelle, New York: Arlington House, 1982. {{ISBN|0-517-54656-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|51|date=February 2014}}

RKO produced a remake titled ''[[A Game of Death]]'' (1945), directed by [[Robert Wise]], from a screenplay Norman Houston wrote. This film stars [[John Loder (actor)|John Loder]] and [[Audrey Long]], with [[Edgar Barrier]] as the mad hunter.&lt;ref name="RKO Story"/&gt;{{Rp|206|date=February 2014}} In order to keep with events of that time, ''A Game of Death'' changed Zaroff into "Erich Kreiger", a Nazi, and was set in the aftermath of the [[Second World War]].

In 1956, United Artists released another film adaptation, ''[[Run for the Sun]]'', starring [[Richard Widmark]], [[Trevor Howard]] and [[Jane Greer]].&lt;ref name="RKO Story"/&gt;{{Rp|206|date=February 2014}}

In 1961, the film ''[[Bloodlust!]]'' was released, directed by [[Ralph Brooke]] and starring [[Wilton Graff]] as the Zaroff-type character, and [[Robert Reed]] as the leader of a band of youths who become stranded on the island.

1972's ''[[The Woman Hunt]]'' starring [[John Ashley (actor)|John Ashley]] and [[Sid Haig]] made for [[Roger Corman]]'s [[New World Pictures]] is an unofficial remake of the story. 

The Australian film ''[[Turkey Shoot (1982 film)|Turkey Shoot]]'' has similar elements.

[[John Woo]]'s first Hollywood directorial effort, the [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] thriller ''[[Hard Target]]'' (1993), was loosely based on the same story. The locale was shifted to 1990s New Orleans, with homeless Vietnam war veterans voluntarily serving (in return for potential payment from a shady businessman) as human prey.

In ''[[Surviving the Game]]'' (1994), a homeless man is hired as a survival guide for a group of wealthy businessmen on a hunting trip in the mountains. He is unaware that they are killers who hunt humans for sport, and that he is their new prey. Directed by Ernest R. Dickerson, the film stars [[Rutger Hauer]], [[Ice-T]], and [[Charles S. Dutton]].

''[[The Pest (1997 film)|The Pest]]'' (1997) is a comedic parody of the story, with German huntsman Gustav Shank accidentally bringing Puerto Rican teenage hustler Pestario "Pest" Vargas to his island instead of the skilled man he had intended to hunt, only to decide to hunt the Pest anyway due to his sheer obnoxiousness. Shank's ambition is to have a head of a warrior of every ethnicity in his Trophy Room. He also rigs the "game" by having his prey unknowingly drink a slow-acting poison before the hunt, making sure that they die even if they escape him. 

In '' [[The Eliminator (film)|The Eliminator]]'' (2004), seven captured people are hunted at night for sport on an island as a betting game for the wealthy.

''[[The Simpsons]]'' Halloween special "[[Treehouse of Horror XVI]]" contained a segment "Survival of the Fattest" which parodied the story closely. In this segment Mr. Burns invited much of the cast to his hunting lodge on a private island only to reveal that he intended to hunt them all for sport. Another episode makes a reference to "The Most Dangerous Game" when [[Rainier Wolfcastle]] says that he bought a [[YMCA]] to demolish it and install a hunting ground dedicated to "hunt the most dangerous animal of all... Man".

An episode of the animated series ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'' entitled "Hunted!" is an obvious parody of the story. The titular Johnny is forced to go through the same ordeal, but his stupidity and foolishness greatly frustrates the hunter, who eventually allows him to leave.

===Other adaptations===

In a song called “Fly Over the Wall” by Joey Pecoraro, the opening interaction between Rainsford and General Zaroff is used as a prelude to the actual song.

The [[Rooster Teeth]] series "Let's Play Minecraft" featured an adaptation of the story into a game played by the show's cast members in the video game [[Minecraft]], where one player was given a map and hunted by the other five in and around the in-game world created by the [[Rooster Teeth|Achievement Hunter]] cast members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2719">The term '''useful Jew''' was used in various historical contexts, typically describing a [[Jew]]ish person useful in implementing an official authority's policy, sometimes by oppressing other Jews.

* In 1744, [[Frederick II of Prussia]] introduced the practice of limiting Jewish population to a small number of the most wealthy families, known as "[[protected Jew]]s" (''Schutzjuden'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_image.cfm?image_id=571 Certificate Confirming Payment of Protection Money (''Schutzgeld'') for a Jewish Resident (1833)]&lt;/ref&gt; The first-born son in such families inherited this [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]; other children were considered useless by the authorities and had the choice of either abstaining from marriage or leaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Simon Dubnow |first=Simon |last=Dubnow |title=The Newest History of the Jewish People, 1789–1914 |location= |publisher= |isbn= }}{{Full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Following the establishment of the [[Pale of Settlement]] by [[Imperial Russia]], only "useful Jews" ({{lang-ru|полезные евреи}}) were allowed to live outside the Pale; these included Jews such as wealthy first-rung merchants ({{lang-ru|купцы первой гильдии}}), persons who had received [[higher education]], [[cantonist]]s (after serving their full term in the army), and some other categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=How Russia Shaped the Modern World: From Art to Anti-Semitism, Ballet to Bolshevism |first=Steven G. |last=Marks |page=142 |isbn=0-691-11845-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.axt.org.uk/antisem/archive/archive4/russia/russia.htm Russia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120013849/http://www.axt.org.uk/antisem/archive/archive4/russia/russia.htm |date=2008-11-20 }} at Institute for Jewish Policy Research&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Soviet Union]], Jewish members of the [[Anti-Zionist Committee of the Soviet Public]] were colloquially known as "useful Jews" or "pocket Jews" ({{lang-ru|карманные евреи}}), implying their corruption by high positions in the state [[hierarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.sem40.ru/anti/history/1501/ The infamous AZCSP (in Russian)] Prepared by Moscow Bureau for human rights.

[[File:'The feast of reason, and the flow of soul,' - ie - the wits of the age, setting the table in a roar by James Gillray.jpg|thumb|'The feast of reason, and the flow of soul,' - i.e. - the wits of the age, setting the table in a roar, by [[James Gillray]] (1797)]]

'''Wit''' is a form of intelligent [[humour]], the ability to say or write things that are clever and usually funny.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.learnersdictionary.com/search/wit|title=Wit|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''wit''' is a person skilled at making clever and funny remarks.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=wit|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/wit|website=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forms of wit include the '''quip''', '''repartee''', and '''wisecrack'''.

==Forms==
As in the wit of [[Dorothy Parker]]'s set, the [[Algonquin Round Table]], witty remarks may be intentionally cruel (as in many [[epigram]]s), and perhaps more [[genius|ingenious]] than funny.

A quip is an observation or saying that has some wit but perhaps descends into [[sarcasm]], or otherwise is short of a point, and a witticism also suggests the diminutive. Repartee is the wit of the quick answer and capping comment: the snappy comeback and neat retort. ([[Oscar Wilde|Wilde]]: "I wish I'd said that." [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]]: "You will, Oscar, you will".)&lt;ref&gt;Monty Python: Oscar Wilde sketch&lt;/ref&gt;

==In poetry==
Wit in [[poetry]] is characteristic of [[metaphysical poetry]] as a style, and was prevalent in the time of English playwright [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], who admonished pretension with the phrase "Better a witty fool than a foolish wit".&lt;ref name="Salingar1976"&gt;{{cite book
|last=Salingar
|first=Leo
|title=Shakespeare and the Traditions of Comedy
|url=
|year=1976
|publisher=Cambridge University Press
|isbn=978-0-521-29113-2
|pages=245–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may combine [[word play]] with conceptual thinking, as a kind of verbal display requiring attention, without intending to be laugh-aloud funny; in fact wit can be a thin disguise for more poignant feelings that are being versified. English poet [[John Donne]] is the representative of this style of poetry.&lt;ref name="Daley1990"&gt;{{cite book
|last=Daley
|first=Koos

|year=1990
|publisher=De Graaf
|isbn=978-90-6004-405-6
|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further meanings==
More generally, one's wits are one's intellectual powers of all types. Native wit &amp;mdash; meaning the wits with which one is born &amp;mdash; is closely synonymous with [[common sense]]. To live by one's wits is to be an [[Opportunism|opportunist]], but not always of the scrupulous kind. To have one's wits about one is to be alert and capable of quick [[reasoning]].  To be at the end of one's wits ("I'm at my wits' end") is to be immensely [[Frustration|frustrated]].
