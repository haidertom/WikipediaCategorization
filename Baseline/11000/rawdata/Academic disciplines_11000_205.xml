      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2536">'''Adoxography''' is elegant or refined writing that addresses a trivial or base subject. The term was coined in the late 19th century. It was a form of rhetorical exercise "in which the legitimate methods of the encomium are applied to persons or objects in themselves obviously unworthy of praise, as being trivial, ugly, useless, ridiculous, dangerous or vicious" — see Arthur S. Pease, "Things Without Honor", ''Classical Philology'', Vol. XXI (1926) 27, at 28–9. Pease surveys this field from its origins with the defence of Helen ascribed to Gorgias, and cites De Quincey's "[[On Murder Considered as one of the Fine Arts]]" and Lewis Carroll’s ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' as modern examples. Pease suggests that the skill was taught in ancient Greece, where the matters known to have been praised included gout, blindness, deafness, old age, negligence, adultery, flies, gnats, bedbugs, smoke, and dung. 

The art was rediscovered during the revival of [[rhetoric]] in the 16th century. Among the best known and most influential examples was [[Erasmus]]' ''Moriae Encomium'' or ''[[The Praise of Folly]]''.  

==Literary Examples==
The first English treatise on the subject was Anthony Munday's ''"The defence of contraries"'' (1593), a translation of Charles Estienne's "Paradoxes, ce sont propos contre la commune opinion" and based on Ortensio Landi's "Paradossi". It contained essays that praised, amongst other things, poverty, drunkenness and stupidity.  [[Walter K. Olson]], writing in the Leisure &amp; Arts section of the September 8, 2005, edition of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', quotes the following passage from Sadakat Kadri, "The Trial: A History, from Socrates to O.J. Simpson": "Elizabethan schoolboys...were commonly taught adoxography, the art of eruditely praising worthless things." The passage comes in the course of an account of Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]'s trial, and Kadri observes that Munday thought [[lawyers]] could particularly learn from his book. This was a period of English history when the jury trial was assuming its modern form, and Kadri later shows that the ability to praise apparently worthless causes has been central to courtroom [[advocacy]] for centuries. Celebrated adoxographers could therefore be said to include men such as [[Cicero]] and [[Clarence Darrow]].

In modern writing, the term "adoxography" is also used as an often humorous self-reference in writing, often in regard to humor columns or blogs.

&lt;/ref&gt;
) is an Argentina-born feminist and anti-trafficking activist. After a police raid at the brothel where she was being sexually exploited in 2012, she began advocating for the abolition of prostitution. She attracted media attention in Argentina when she sued her exploiters and the city where the brothel was located. She became known worldwide when the U.S. Department of State gave her an award for her anti-trafficking activism.

== Childhood and family ==
Kinan's family had enough money to provide her a good education, but her life began to spiral downhill when her father began to abuse her mother. Kinan has said that her mother, along with her grandmother and her aunts, were prostituted.&lt;ref name="historia"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.laretaguardia.com.ar/2015/03/la-historia-de-alika-kinan-del-trabajo.html | dead-url=no | title=La historia de Alika Kinán, del trabajo sexual a la trata en primera persona | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731230249/http://www.laretaguardia.com.ar/2015/03/la-historia-de-alika-kinan-del-trabajo.html | archive-date=2017-07-31 | date=2015-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has described how her father used to tell stories after dinner about how he met her mother and how he rescued her from the ''zulo''.&lt;ref name="desprender"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.marcha.org.ar/alika-kinan-estoy-tratando-de-desprenderme-del-lugar-de-victima-es-todo-un-proceso/ | title=Alika Kinan: "Estoy tratando de desprenderme del lugar de víctima. Es todo un proceso" | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620210439/http://www.marcha.org.ar/alika-kinan-estoy-tratando-de-desprenderme-del-lugar-de-victima-es-todo-un-proceso | dead-url=no | archive-date=2017-06-20 | date=2015-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Zulo'' is a word with many meanings. In this context, it could mean either a small, wretched apartment, or a brothel.) Kinan was raped at age fourteen. Her parents separated when she was fifteen and her younger sister was nine, and her father stopped supporting the family.&lt;ref name="esclava"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.clarin.com/sociedad/esclava-sexual-justicia-alika_0_1346265427.html/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428174854/http://www.clarin.com/sociedad/esclava-sexual-justicia-alika_0_1346265427.html | dead-url=no | date=2015-04-26 | title=Fui una esclava sexual durante 20 años y ahora busco justicia | archive-date=2015-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abandoned by parents, enters sex work ==
A year later Kinan's mother went to [[Buenos Aires]], leaving her to care for her sister.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; (According to some sources, Kinan's mother took Kinan and her sister to [[Buenos Aires]] and Kinan later returned to [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]].&lt;ref name="incomoda"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://revistaharoldo.com.ar/nota.php?id=180 | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-15 | title=Las incómodas verdades de Alika Kinan | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802204533/http://revistaharoldo.com.ar/nota.php?id=180  | archive-date=2017-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Kinan tried cooking and selling a local pastry but couldn't earn enough to support herself and her sister. Her father refused to help her.&lt;ref name="esclava" /&gt; Reportedly, he told her "You know what you have to do," implying that she should become a prostitute.&lt;ref name="incomoda" /&gt; She worked for someone for three months but received no pay. A friend suggested working at Aries, a brothel run out of a private apartment.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt;

Kinan remembers her decision to enter sex work:

{{quote |text=My grandmother was a prostitute, my mom and my aunts too, it's like being in that situation seems natural. When my mom leaves I'm left in charge of my sister, who is a lot younger than me. There came a time when we did not have anything to eat, we had nowhere to live, it was an extreme situation, I was left with a small child and I was facing that situation. It was then that a girl makes me an offer in a place X, and tells me that we could go to a private apartment where they were hosting bachelor parties, it was like a massage place, it all seemed very strange. At that time I did not go, until the situation was so extreme that I was up to my neck and one day I found myself ringing the bell at the place that had been pointed out to me.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

Kinan was seventeen at the time.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; She remembers her first client as being grotesquely fat and smelling like talcum powder.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; She still remembers the odor:

{{quote |text=on the subject of the massages, there are those strange scents that stay with you for life. It's very disgusting. It's those memories that you try to bury under everything else.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

After that, she worked at bachelor parties and continued seeing individual clients. She received 40% of the clients' fees, which was enough to rent a place for her and her sister.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; While still underage, she attracted the attention of the police and spent more time hiding from them than servicing clients,&lt;ref name="aislada"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://cosecharoja.org/alika-kinan-amenazas | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-04 | title=Alika Kinan esta aislada y declarara en Camara Gesell | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428184203/http://cosecharoja.org/alika-kinan-amenazas | archive-date=2017-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which would have reduced the amount of money she could earn to support herself and her sister. She says

{{quote |text=... when I was younger, I tried to avoid the police because there was a follow-up, a payment of fines, but I was still underage and if the police caught me it would be worse.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

At one point during this period, Kinan seems to have also been supporting her father. She says that he lived with her and asked her for money. He also threatened to get a lawyer and take her younger sister away from her.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt;

== Ushuaia ==
Up to this time, Kinan had been moving back and forth between [[Cruz del Eje]] and the city of [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]].&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; Another woman recommended that she move to [[Ushuaia]], in [[Argentina]]'s [[Tierra del Fuego]] region.&lt;ref name="marea"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/las12/13-9654-2015-04-24.html | dead-url=no | date=2015-04-24 | title=Contra viento y marea | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608172723/https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/las12/13-9654-2015-04-24.html | archive-date=2016-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinan was told that she would get many clients who paid well in dollars, and she could keep 50% of the clients fees, as opposed to the 40% that she kept in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]].

{{ quote | text=She said to me "I was in the south, you earn very good money, there are fishing boats, many foreigners, you can charge in dollars, you earn double because you are paid best."  ... they gave you 40%, and so I went to Ushuaia where they did not deduct so much.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

Different sources report her age at this time as fifteen,&lt;ref name="distinguida"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://noticias.unsam.edu.ar/2017/07/05/alika-kinan-distinguida-heroina-en-estados-unidos-por-su-lucha-contra-la-trata | dead-url=no | access-date=2017-07-03 | title=Alika Kinan, distinguida "Heroína" en Estados Unidos por su lucha contra la trata | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805105401/http://noticias.unsam.edu.ar/2017/07/05/alika-kinan-distinguida-heroina-en-estados-unidos-por-su-lucha-contra-la-trata | archive-date=2017-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; eighteen,&lt;ref name="honoree"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/06/29/534709918/state-department-honoree-was-trapped-in-a-brothel-for-nearly-20-years | dead-url=no | date=2017-06-29 | title=State Department Honoree Was Trapped In A Brothel For Nearly 20 Years | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703221203/http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/06/29/534709918/state-department-honoree-was-trapped-in-a-brothel-for-nearly-20-years | archive-date=2017-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; nineteen&lt;ref name="sobrevivio"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cba24n.com.ar/content/sobrevivio-la-trata-y-es-querellante-contra-sus-proxenetas |dead-url=no | date=2016-11-10| title=Sobrevivió a la trata y es querellante contra sus proxenetas | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114132159/http://www.cba24n.com.ar/content/sobrevivio-la-trata-y-es-querellante-contra-sus-proxenetas | archive-date=2016-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or twenty.&lt;ref name="incomoda" /&gt; She was born in 1976&lt;ref name="calvario"/&gt; and went to [[Ushuaia]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt; If she arrived before her birthday on 24 June, she would have been nineteen. If she arrived after her birthday, she would have been twenty. But in either case she was likely to be closer to her twentieth birthday than her nineteenth. A plane ticket was sent to her and in [[Ushuaia]] she began work at a nightclub called Sheik where, as promised, she kept 50% of the clients' fees. After a while she rented a place and sent for her sister, paying for her school, English classes, computers, clothing, and food.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt;

(Various sources give the name of the nightclub as "El Sheikh", "El Sheik", "Sheikh", and "Sheik". Photographs of the nightclub show a sign saying "Sheik", so that is the name used in this article.)

== Marriage ==
According to Kinan's ex-husband, Miguel Pascual, they met in 1996, the same year she arrived in [[Ushuaia]]. She had already changed employers and was working at the nightclub Black &amp; White.&lt;ref name="sola"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.enperspectiva.com.ar/alika-no-esta-sola-comienza-el-juicio-en-tierra-del-fuego | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-04 | title=Alika no está sola: comienza el juicio en Tierra del Fuego | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109001257/https://www.enperspectiva.com.ar/alika-no-esta-sola-comienza-el-juicio-en-tierra-del-fuego | archive-date=2016-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He paid her managers extra to spend extra time with her, but she wasn't informed&lt;ref name="denouncer"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thedawn-news.org/2016/11/15/argentina-alika-kinan-from-victim-to-denouncer-of-a-trafficking-network | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-03 | title=Argentina: Alika Kinan, from victim to denouncer of a trafficking network | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729225407/http://www.thedawn-news.org/2016/11/15/argentina-alika-kinan-from-victim-to-denouncer-of-a-trafficking-network | archive-date=2017-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as she comments, "... obviously I did not see any of it."&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; Pascual served three yearlong tours of duty on a ship that supplied [[Spain]]'s Antarctic bases. He and Kinan saw each other during those three years when his boat docked in [[Ushuaia]].&lt;ref name="sola"/&gt; He told her he wanted her to be his life partner.&lt;ref name="denouncer"/&gt; Kinan was apparently in danger at the time:

{{quote |text=People from Rio Grande had come looking for me with guns, I went with a boy a little bigger than I, who suggested that I go on vacation with him, he was very insistent and the truth that I had to run from here because at any moment some pimp with guns was going to create a bad situation ...&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

In a different interview, she didn't mention the pimps with guns, but she indicated a similar degree of desperation:

{{ quote | text=The point is that this guy left a lot of money every time he came, always paid in dollars - it's the time of 1 to 1 [The Argentine peso was pegged to the U.S. dollar at one to one.] and I said that in order to leave that place I was going wherever he went. I was not in love. I submitted.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; }}

So he took her on vacation in [[Barcelona]] where his family had businesses and drove Mercedes, and she ended up staying with him in Spain and bringing her sister over.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt;

In Kinan's description of the marriage, she worked at businesses owned by her husband's family. One source says that he collected half her wages,&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt; another says that he collected all of her wages.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; She wasn't allowed to use the car and was required to function as the maid. To support her sister, she secretly sold her eggs. (It must have been extremely difficult to hide this from her husband without a car.&lt;ref name="eggDonation"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_donation#The_egg_donor.27s_process_in_detail | dead-url=no | access-date=2017-07-01 | title=Egg donation - Wikipedia | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170127132005/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_donation | archive-date=2017-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) She says her husband quickly became violent.

{{ quote | text=... I was faced with a violent guy, a family where violence was naturalized. I remember that the first time he hit me was the few months I went with him, and the first thing I did was tell the mother, because he had smashed the remote control in my face, and she asked me "but what did you do?" Then I realized I was to the oven. [An Argentine idiom indicating being in a bad situation from which there is no escape.]&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

A few days before the start of the trial, Pascual gave a very different description of their marriage, which he described as "hell from the first day." He claims that it was she who assaulted him, and that he defended himself without hitting her.

{{ quote | text=She tried to hit me two times, I am a master of martial arts, and both times I took her by the hair and back, and I put her on her knees ... Both times I immobilized her when she tried to hit me, but she never hit me.&lt;ref name="sola"/&gt; }}

Kinan says that at some point after the birth of their second child, her husband sent her to a brothel.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; Her husband denies the accusations of forced labor and forced prostitution.

{{ quote | text=At no time was she forced. She worked in Spain with my brother in a transport company. She has lied about me, about my mother saying that she forced her to work.

[The eldest daughter] was in Buenos Aires saying that her mother had been mistreated and forced into prostitution in Spain, and that never happened. I can give names of the companies in which she worked and I have a thousand witnesses.&lt;ref name="sola"/&gt; }}

Over nine years they had three children. According to Kinan, one night when the oldest was eight, she refused to do her homework and her father hit her hard enough to cause bleeding. Kinan decided that she needed to leave [[Spain]] and persuaded her husband to take them all back to [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; According to her husband, Miguel Pascual, they moved to [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] in [[Argentina]] in 2008, and separated in 2010. At that point he returned to Spain&lt;ref name="redito"&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://cronicasfueguinas.blogspot.com/2016/11/alika-usa-mis-hijas-para-sacar-redito.html | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-02 | title=Alika usa mis hijas para sacar redito economico | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106142803/http://cronicasfueguinas.blogspot.com/2016/11/alika-usa-mis-hijas-para-sacar-redito.html | archive-date=2016-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kinan returned to [[Ushuaia]] and Sheik to support herself and her children.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt;

As with Kinan, there are some discrepancies in different versions of Pascual's story. At one point he said that he and Kinan separated, and he continued sending money for their daughters until he discovered that she had returned to sex work.&lt;ref name="redito"/&gt; In another account he claimed to be present when she made the phone call to Sheik to ask about returning to sex work. In this telling, they separated because she was returning to sex work, and he later stopped sending money because she married another man whom she was supporting.&lt;ref name="sola"/&gt;

== Brothel work ==
Following the police raid at the Black &amp; White nightclub/brothel, news outlets published information about the brothel's operations. Much of this information relates to aspects of brothel operation that aren't described in news reports describing Sheik. Kinan worked at Black &amp; White immediately before leaving for [[Spain]]. This section uses information about both Sheik and Black &amp; White to give a more complete picture of the working conditions that Kinan would have encountered.

Alika Kinan's experience at the two brothels were probably common for sex workers across the southern Cone area. Descriptions of brothels in two Chilean cities not far from [[Ushuaia]] and in [[Ushuaia]] itself closely match the business operations of Sheik and Black &amp; White.&lt;ref name="otherMenus"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.erraticrock.com/information/information-articles-1/just-exploring-other-menus | dead-url=no | access-date=2017-07-16 | title=Just Exploring Other Menus |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729110434/http://www.erraticrock.com/information/information-articles-1/just-exploring-other-menus |archive-date=2017-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Information and employees seem to have moved more or less freely between the six brothels of [[Ushuaia]], which were located within a few blocks of each other.&lt;ref name="commercialized"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.patagonia-argentina.com/en/commercialized-sexual-activity | dead-url=no | access-date=2017-07-19 | title=Commercialized sexual activity  | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708233852/http://www.patagonia-argentina.com/en/commercialized-sexual-activity | archive-date=2017-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When many of [[Ushuaia]]'s sex workers migrated to [[Punto Arenas]] in [[Chile]] after the police raids shut down the brothels in [[Ushuaia]],&lt;ref name="denouncer"/&gt; it was a one-time group migration, but it probably followed a path previously forged by individual sex workers moving between the two cities. No two businesses operate in exactly the same way, but these two brothels can be taken as a rough proxy for legally regulated brothels in [[Patagonia]].

=== Management ===
==== Sheik ====
The primary manager at Sheik was Pedro Montoya, who was involved with the brothel throughout its existence. During an earlier period, his co-manager was his wife Claudia Quiroga, who owned the property where the brothel was located. The on-site supervisor under Quiroga was Corina Sánchez.

At the time of the police raid, Quiroga and Sánchez were no longer involved. The co-manager was Montoya's girlfriend Ivana Claudia García, and the on-site supervisor was Lucy Alberca Campos. García's brother Jorge Etcheverry worked as a recruiter for the brothel.

During the trial, Kinan described how the managers used surveillance cameras to monitor the women:

{{ quote | They ordered us where to position ourselves, how we should sit, because Claudia operated the cameras wherever you were. When the phone rang you knew it was Claudia who was watching who was coming in, who had to get on the phone, if you were standing, if you had gone to the bathroom a lot, because they monitored even the times you went to the bathroom. Everything was monitored.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; }}

One woman was described by the managers as "like the fish, you use everything but the head."&lt;ref name="chicas"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/chicas-vulnerables-victimas-negocio-ushuaia_0_Hy5W6y-bl.html | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-09 | title=Chicas pobres y vulnerables, las víctimas del negocio de la trata en Ushuaia | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729214706/https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/chicas-vulnerables-victimas-negocio-ushuaia_0_Hy5W6y-bl.html | archive-date=2017-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Equivalent to the American expression "butterface" or the Australian expression "prawn.") This was cited at the trial as an example of the managers' contempt toward the women.&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt; At the trial, one of the police witnesses said that the managers mislead the women in order to recruit them, and then belittled them for their poverty and poor education.&lt;ref name="finalizo"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://banderafueguina.com.ar/noticia/1402/finalizo-la-tercera-jornada-de-juicio-con-la-declaracion-de-una-de-las-mujeres-r | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-10 | title=Finalizó la tercera jornada de juicio con la declaración de una de las mujeres rescatadas del Sheik | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803130104/http://banderafueguina.com.ar/noticia/1402/finalizo-la-tercera-jornada-de-juicio-con-la-declaracion-de-una-de-las-mujeres-r | archive-date=2017-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinan remembers the following scene:

{{ quote | text=Even the female owner, the girlfriend of the trafficker always told me that she was going to teach me how to work, then she would knock me against the bar and say "give it to me, baby, bring me money, give it to me" and hit the bar hard. I remember that I jumped a few leaps ...&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

On the other hand, Kinan felt that the managers were

{{ quote | text=The family I had never had, the one that never cared for me, I said that they took care of me, gave me housing. That's why I made the decision to return. I thought that corresponded because I had to be working and these people gave me housing, they cared for me, because if something happened, I cut a finger or had to go to the doctor they accompanied me ... they took care that I did not spread disease, that I did not catch any infection, I did not catch the flu. When the snowy season began, they would tell me to go get the vaccine or take something so I would not get sick.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

As Kinan points out, it was good business to keep workers healthy and productive. The feeling that the managers were her family is not surprising, given that between the age of sixteen, when she was left to support herself and her sister, and the age of thirty six, when the police raided Sheik, the brothels of [[Ushuaia]] and her husband were the only ones who concerned themselves about her health, housing, and financial support.

==== Black &amp; White ====
The primary manager at Black &amp; White was Victor Morales, nicknamed "Jefe". His daughter seems to have been second in command. Other people involved in some sort of managerial capacity included his ex-wife, his current girlfriend, and his son.
&lt;ref name="clanMorales"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Sheik, Black and White had security cameras. One woman was so unnerved by their presence that she left shortly after arrival.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt;

=== Workers ===
==== Sheik ====
There were seven women working at Sheik at the time of the police raid, three from the Dominican Republic, one from Paraguay, and three from Argentina.&lt;ref name="operativo"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://cronicasfueguinas.blogspot.com/2012/10/operativo-de-gendarmeria-en-el-sheik.html | dead-url=no | date=2012-10-09 | title=Operativo de Gendarmeria en El Sheik | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151115023424/http://cronicasfueguinas.blogspot.com/2012/10/operativo-de-gendarmeria-en-el-sheik.html | archive-date=2015-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All of them were supporting children with no assistance from the fathers. Most of them hadn't finished formal basic education and had no good alternatives to sex work.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt; One of the women had only the clothes she was wearing when she moved to [[Ushuaia]] to work at Sheik.&lt;ref name="chicas"/&gt;

==== Black &amp; White ====
Black &amp; White's web site promised twenty-five women. During the police investigation the number of women employed varied from twelve to twenty. At the time of the raid it employed eighteen women. The majority of them were from the Dominican Republic,

Most of them were in their twenties. A woman who was thirty eight said that Morales was initially reluctant to hire her because of her age.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the women who were described, one had left home and was struggling to support herself, one had debts, and two had been doing sex work in [[Rosario, Santa Fe]] and came to [[Ushuaia]] for the job. One of the women was mentally ill and her condition prompted the police to end the investigation and raid the brothel.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt;

One of the women interviewed by the prosecutors during the Black &amp; White investigation testified that she had been seventeen years old when Morales recruited her. She said that he brought her to [[Ushuaia]] along with two other underage girls. When they arrived at the house they would live in, they found other employees of the brothel who were also underage.

However, at the time of the police raid, all of the women employed by the brothel were legally adults.

=== Government involvement in the brothels ===
When a sex worker first arrived at [[Ushuaia]], she would first be taken to the police station where the provincial police would take her finger prints,
&lt;ref name="fallo"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
open a file on her, and ensure that she had no criminal record.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; The city government then set up a health book that recorded her medical examinations.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt; The city of [[Ushuaia]] required the women to undergo regular examinations, involving tests for HIV and [[sexually transmitted infection]]s and analysis of vaginal discharges.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt; There were no examinations at Sheik during the period of police surveillance. The women were probably relieved; a witness at the trial testified that the inspectors mocked and humiliated the women they were examining.&lt;ref name="dia05"/&gt; The owner of Sheik testified during the trial that there were two to three inspections per month,&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt; and listed inspections to confirm that the business permits were in order, that there was a fire extinguisher, and that the entertainers had their sanitary pads.
&lt;ref name="socio"&gt;
{{cite news 
| title= Caso Alika Kinan: "Yo soy el socio minoritario de las señoritas"

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city continued the police registration and medical inspections of women in the local brothels after the time Argentina's anti-trafficking law was passed in 2008 (see the article [[Human trafficking in Argentina]]) until the first brothel raids in 2012. In addition, one source says that the city charged for inspections and the renewal of a woman's health book,&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt; which occurred quarterly.&lt;ref name="dia05"/&gt;

This matches a historical pattern in [[Argentina]]'s [[Patagonia]] region. Municipal governments, strongly influenced by local businessmen, wanted to use their powers of regulation to maintain their tax bases and were opposed to too much interference in the brothel business. The provincial police had other funding sources and wanted to restrict brothel activities in unprofitable ways. The municipal government of Rio Gallegos was founded in 1912, and by 1914 there was already conflict between the city and the police of Santa Cruz province over the regulation of brothels.
&lt;ref name="rioGallegos"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of [[Ushuaia]], the conflict was between the municipal government and the federal justice system. About the same time as the police raid on Sheik, the city council of [[Ushuaia]] was advised that it should pass a law closing the remaining nightclubs.

=== Recruitment ===
==== Sheik ====
None of the women working at Sheik were from [[Ushuaia]]. Some came from elsewhere in Argentina and some came from other countries.&lt;ref name="dia03"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lasrojas.com.ar/juicio-de-alika-dia-3 | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-09 | title=Juicio de Alika.

Pedro Montoya, the owner, testified that all the women came from other brothels, either in [[Ushuaia]] or elsewhere.&lt;ref name="dia04"/&gt; Kinan herself worked at two brothels in [[Ushuaia]]. Montoya said that he got calls from women asking to work at Sheik.&lt;ref name="dia04"/&gt; Montoya and his girlfriend and business partner Ivana Claudia García were responsible for recruitment, but García seems to have done most of the recruiting with help from her brother, whose sole function at the nightclub was recruiter.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/fecha-juicio-oral-emblematico-trata_0_BJlV0IN6.html | title=Tiene fecha el juicio oral de un emblemático caso de trata | dead-url=no |date=2016-09-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728144115/https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/fecha-juicio-oral-emblematico-trata_0_BJlV0IN6.html | archive-date=2017-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Black &amp; White ====
Women were recruited from various provinces, including [[Santiago del Estero]], [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], and [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], as well as from outside the country. Between 2009 and 2012, Victor Morales published more than 100 ads in [[Buenos Aires]] newspapers.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; Two of the ads running in the newspaper Clarin offered waitresses 20,000 pesos per month, and dancers 10,000 pesos per month. Both offered travel expenses to [[Ushuaia]], lodging, and relocation expenses.
&lt;ref name="rescataron"&gt;
{{cite news 
| title= Rescataron a 15 mujeres de una red de trata en Ushuaia

| archive-date= 2017-07-30 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The women who were recruited with these ads discovered that once they had arrived at [[Ushuaia]], they were expected to repay the travel costs. Morales was more honest with a sex worker he recruited through an ad and told her during their initial contact that she would repay him with the money from her sessions with clients.&lt;ref name="polemicas"/&gt; One of the sources who saw transcripts of the police wire taps put it this way:

{{ quote | text= According to the degree of naivety of the person who needed the job, [Morales] revealed more or less data.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; }}

While this approach may have helped persuade more women to travel to [[Ushuaia]], it also meant that some left as soon as they arrived.

Police telephone taps recorded the following conversation:

{{ quote | text=Nancy: Clearly, and the work is?

Victor: Well the work you mix with the public, you are not forced to prostitute yourself if you don't want, that is what you choose, when and how, yes? And the price, at least I put a price that from there up, you can charge more or equal, but not less, that are three hundred pesos fifteen minutes, four hundred the half hour, and five hundred an hour, and then the part, Let's say that it closes to me, that it serves me, the others let's say is a consequence, if you want to do it, you do and if you do not want to do it you do not do it, those are the services yes, but the drinks cost one hundred ...&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; }}

Morales wasn't telling her that both the city and provincial governments would label her a prostitute, the provincial police would fingerprint her, check her criminal record, and open a file on her, or that the city would periodically inspect her genitals, test her for STIs, and maintain a record of the results.

A women who had worked as a professional dancer answered one of Morales' ads for dancers. While Morales explains about selling drinks to "Nancy" in the transcript above, the dancer didn't learn about it until her first night in the nightclub. That was also when she learned that she was expected to make herself available for sexual sessions with the clients. When she objected to working in a brothel, one of the female managers slapped her and fined her four hundred pesos for talking back. She said that one night she hid in a bathroom and the managers beat her and forced her back to the bar.&lt;ref name="rossi"/&gt;

In contrast, eleven of the eighteen women at the brothel when the police raided it told investigators that they were there by their own choice. They didn't feel that they had been tricked or that they were being exploited.&lt;ref name="prueba"/&gt;

Over a period of two years, the city of [[Ushuaia]] issued seventy health books to Black &amp; White.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; Since each health book represents a new employee, the nightclub was recruiting about three new employees every month. Assuming that the nightclub employed an average of eighteen women over that two year time period, the average period of employment would be about six months. Once the nightclub hired a woman, it would need to recruit her replacement six months later.

In addition to ads, women were recruited through informal networks. One woman contacted Morales through a friend. Another was recruited through contacts at Madaho's, a well known bar (strip joint

) in the [[Recoleta, Buenos Aires|Recoleta]] neighborhood of [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt;

=== Living conditions ===
==== Sheik ====
During the trial, lawyers for the [[complainant]] described the women living in rooms off the main hall of the nightclub,&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt; which they described as small, dirty, bad smelling, and visited by rats. Kinan described their quarters as a ''zulo'' (a cramped, impoverished living space) lacking hot water, with 2 people sharing a room.&lt;ref name="derogar"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.eldiario.com.ar/sociedad/kinan-ldquohay-que-derogar-los-coacutedigos-de-contravencioacutenrdquo-1.htm# | dead-url=no | date=2017-03-26 | title=Kinan: "Hay que derogar los códigos de contravención" | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326165843/http://www.eldiario.com.ar/sociedad/kinan-ldquohay-que-derogar-los-coacutedigos-de-contravencioacutenrdquo-1.htm | archive-date=2017-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a bell in the area of the rooms activated at the bar which was rung to signal to the woman that a client had entered the nightclub.&lt;ref name="conocera"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.enperspectiva.com.ar/alika-el-29-de-noviembre-se-conocera-la-sentencia | dead-url=no | access-date=2017-07-08 | title=Alika Kinan: el 29 de noviembre se conocerá la sentencia | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802011922/https://www.enperspectiva.com.ar/alika-el-29-de-noviembre-se-conocera-la-sentencia/ | archive-date=2017-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each room had its own entrance separate from the nightclub's main entrance and each of the women had their own key.&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt;

Prior to the raid on Black &amp; White, the women serviced their clients in their rooms. Testimony at the trial described them using bleach to remove blood and semen stains from their mattresses.&lt;ref name="dia05"/&gt; In addition to sharing a room with a coworker, each woman was also bringing clients into her room an average of two to three times a night. (See Money section.) With two women in a room, that would be a minimum of four client visits per room per night. There wouldn't have been much privacy.

A post on a monger board made in 2006 says that Sheik had four bedrooms, which matches with other testimony. However, the post says that Sheik had eighteen women working there at the time.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
If they were all living at the brothel, that would be four women in each of two rooms and five women in each of the other two, with a corresponding number of client visits to each room every night. Even if some of the women were living and servicing their clients off-site, it would have been pretty crowded.

==== Black &amp; White ====
Unlike Sheik, the women at Black &amp; White lived off-site. They shared a house with coworkers and paid 300 pesos rent per month.&lt;ref name="fallo"/&gt; Rent for one room in [[Ushuaia]] can go as high as 15,000 pesos per month,&lt;ref name="privados"/&gt; so the rent charged by Black &amp; White was not unreasonable for shared living space. The nightclub had two rooms where the women and their clients had their sessions,&lt;ref name="fallo"/&gt; so the women weren't bringing clients into their living space.

While the women at Sheik had keys to their living quarters, one witness reported being barred from leaving the house where Black &amp; White's employees lived. She said that there were three men who lived in the house who transported them between the house and the nightclub. When she wanted to walk out of the house onto the street in order to have a phone conversation with relatives without house mates around, the men prevented her from leaving.&lt;ref name="polemicas"/&gt;

In contrast, Kinan was working at Black &amp; White during all but a few months of the first three years she lived in [[Ushuaia]]. During this period she rented a place for her sister to live in, which suggests that she was free to travel around the city and conduct business.&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt; The dancer who objected to being tricked into working at a brothel sometimes left the house on her own and was allowed to use a computer with Internet access.&lt;ref name="rossi"/&gt;

One of the women was mentally ill, and the prosecutors said that she was imprisoned. From the prosecutors statements, it's impossible to tell if the brothel recruited her inadvertently and didn't know how to care for her properly while they figured out how to get rid of her, or if they were taking advantage of her illness in some way.

=== Interaction with clients ===
==== Sheik ====
The city is far enough south that during the summer there is daylight twenty four hours a day. The premises opened at 8 pm.&lt;ref name="sinFin" /&gt; The police testimony at the trial described women arriving at the nightclub from the living quarters.&lt;ref name="chicas"/&gt; The women were required to be on duty from 11 pm to 6 am, and received one day off each week.&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt; (In one interview, Kinan said that the work shift started at 11:30 pm.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt;) However, Kinan testified that shifts could extend to 8 am or even 2 pm.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; There was a listing near the bar with prices for drinks and women. The women were available for 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1 hour.&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt; Police witnesses said that men started arriving at the nightclub around midnight, and women would leave with the men, returning alone.&lt;ref name="chicas"/&gt; When a customer left the nightclub with a woman, he had to pay the nightclub the price of a cup or half a cup, depending on how long the woman was going to be gone. (The nightclub paid 20 pesos for a drink and charged the customers 150 pesos, which the owner himself described as "cheating the customers".)&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt;

When the women first arrived at [[Ushuaia]], the nightclub seems to have given them names to use while working. Kinan was given the name "Carla".&lt;ref name="sinFin"/&gt; The women wore shorts or dresses while working, with tops, exaggerated high heels, and carefully styled hair. Clothing was brightly colored. Police officers described the clothing as scanty and less than is normally worn in a pub.&lt;ref name="chicas"/&gt; (This may be an exaggeration. The [https://www.diomedia.com/stock-photo-prostitutes-in-ushuaia-argentina-image8281289.html two sex workers in a photo taken at the Black &amp; White Club] in [[Ushuaia]] look like any two women at a bar.)

Women were not allowed to wear the same clothes two days in a row and were required to smell like imported perfume. According to the owner Montoya, they were to be "fine whores".

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nightclub Black &amp; White had been raided about six months before the police raid at Sheik. Prior to the raid at Black &amp; White, the women at Sheik had serviced their clients in the rooms where they lived. After the raid at Black &amp; White, the women and their clients left Sheik and either went to the client's home or to a hotel room.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt;

Women who were menstruating were required to stanch the flow with a sponge to avoid getting the client dirty.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt;

Kinan described her clients as

{{ quote | text=politicians, municipal officials, government officials, even a commissioner would come and get me. Also those of fishing vessels and foreign tourists. And those who were going to ski that left the women in the hotels.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; }}

Until the raids, ''quecos'', or tours of the brothels, were an accepted male pastime.&lt;ref name="privados"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ushuaiaLists"/&gt;

Women could be fined for refusing a client, for client complaints, or "delaying too much" with a client (i.e. going over the allotted time).&lt;ref name="dia05"/&gt; For poor single women supporting children, the fines were coercive. If a woman tried to avoid a fine by accepting a client with a bad reputation and showed displeasure during an abusive session, she could end up earning less if the client complained and she was fined. The women's ability to manage or negotiate client behavior was considerably reduced. Even the fine for "delaying too much" placed her at the client's mercy. Kinan describes the result:

{{ quote | text=... you find yourself with a crazy boy, a healthy son of the patriarchy, who breaks your ass, who leaves the vagina hanging, with everything that indicates an aggressive sexual act ... I could not handle them when they removed the condom, they would put me on all fours and they would break me. There are no women with rights inside a brothel.
&lt;ref name="extrema"&gt;

| archive-date= 2017-07-28 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The nightclub had installed bells in the women's rooms that they could ring if they needed help, for example if a client became violent. However, Kinan testified that often no one would come, the excuse being that the manager was busy with customers.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; In addition, women were expected to encourage clients to buy them the nightclub's overpriced drinks. The constant consumption of alcohol further reduced the women's ability to handle badly behaved clients. Kinan tells the following story, which illustrates the combined effects of coercive fines, too much alcohol, and managerial indifference:

{{ quote | text=One day I was smoking a cigarette and I see one of the girls, very young, Correntina, 18, who goes with an old man we already knew was terrible, a degenerate. Then I tell the manager not to let her go with that degenerate because she was very little. And he says, "Well, well, you're going to work." I say "poor girl," but I finished my cigarette and left, but then I see that he starts asking for the Fresita champagne, and takes seven in a period of an hour and a half, got drunk, a terrible state. I am very motherly, I always tried to take care of my companions, then I see that he is going to ask for the keys of the room where they had sex, and I tell the manager not to give them to him. But he leaves and I continue with what I was doing, I am preoccupied with my own work and I forget, it wasn't my job to monitor her, nor to take care of her, I had to take care of myself, for that there were the managers and so on. Then it was like five o'clock in the morning and the little girl appeared crying, she was still very drunk, and she says "he took me without a condom", and she tells me that she had fallen asleep from her drunkenness and he had raped her, I didn't know if there were one, five, or how many they had put into the room, and the manager only told her to take a bath in order to go to the hospital to ask for the pill the day after. And nobody saw anything, nobody heard anything, everything was covered because he was a customer and customers had to be taken care of.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

In at least one instance, the managers punished a women who used a bottle to defend herself against four clients who wanted to rape her. The information source doesn't say what the punishment was, only that it lasted a month. Her offense was failing to serve the clients well.
&lt;ref name="juicio"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the subject of condoms, if a client was too forceful during penetration and tore one, the women got a syringe full of vinegar in the vagina.&lt;ref name="derogar"/&gt;

In regard to her experience with violent clients, Kinan says:

{{ quote | text= I have fought, my whole mouth is broken, because I fought to survive, with guys, with girls, guys might have paid me for a hotel and then they wanted to get me the same money they had given me because I do not know they did not like me, or they took too long and I had to go because I had to respond to a house, before the traffickers. [She had to return to the brothel.] Then they told me that they did not pay me anything or that I stayed until they told me. You have to endure rapes, consented or not, it is still a rape, if you are about to [be killed] you have to consent to a rape.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

==== Black &amp; White ====
The brothel operated from midnight to 6 am. According to an employee, the nightclub had the same clients found at Sheik: "... policemen, high-ranking officials, gendarmes and municipal personnel."&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; The fines were similar to the fines imposed at Sheik, and a client complaint or a session that went over its allotted time could cost a woman over half of her share of the earnings from the session.&lt;ref name="fallo"/&gt;

=== Alcohol and drugs ===
{{ quote | text=Alcohol and drugs were good options to be able to make this situation more bearable.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt;

... we were forced to consume alcohol, we had to drink a lot, we used drugs to resist the long nights.&lt;ref name="distinguida"/&gt; }}

Aside from numbing effects of alcohol, the women were being paid to sell and consume drinks. The drinks the women persuaded the men to buy were an important source of income for both the women and the brothel. When a woman approached a potential client, she would tell him to buy her a drink.&lt;ref name="chicas"/&gt; If a women averaged two to three sessions per night (see Money section), that suggests that a woman's clients bought her at least two drinks on the average night. Since she was getting a share of the earnings from the drinks, it was in her interest, financially if not in terms of health, to persuade clients to buy her more. According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, drinking more than three drinks per night or seven drinks per week is high-risk drinking for a woman.
&lt;ref name="highRiskDrinking"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brothels didn't sell drugs as part of their business, but they were present. They show up in Kinan's interviews as part of the environment she worked in. If a client paid for an hour with a woman and wanted her to do a line of coke with him, the ever-present threat of fines and the pressure to keep the client happy would have made it hard to refuse. Stimulants would also counter the effects of alcohol and help the woman stay alert enough to continue working into the morning.&lt;ref name="distinguida"/&gt;

=== Money ===
==== Sheik ====
Police officers who entered Sheik undercover said that women would approach the clients and tell them to buy them a drink, which was paid for at the bar.&lt;ref name="chicas"/&gt; When the women and their clients conducted their sessions at a hotel, payment for the room was made at the bar.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt; However, the women seem to have collected the payment for their services directly from the clients and paid the nightclub's share to the manager.&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt; As mentioned in the Ushuaia section above, the women turned half of the money over to the nightclub.

The nightclub kept all the money for the first five drinks a woman persuaded customers to buy in one night, and then split the proceeds with the woman for all successive drinks. Kinan said that an average night for one woman was eighteen drinks and eight sessions with clients.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; (The Black &amp; White section below gives an estimate of two to three clients per night.) Given the high price of the drinks, the women's share of the proceeds from their sale was probably an important source of income for them.

Reportedly, they were forced to buy clothes, shoes, jewelery, perfumes and condoms from the nightclub. Women were fined for taking too long to come when the bell was rung, for not cleaning, for taking longer than the client paid for, for taking a day off, for refusing to have sex with a client, and for a number of other offences.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dia05"/&gt;

Kinan described how the managers maintained the ''libro de pases''. In the brothel trade, a ''pase'' is a session in which a prostitute provides sexual services to a client. A ''libro de pases'' is basically a log of the brothel's business activities.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt;

==== Black &amp; White ====
The recruitment pitch quoted above gives minimum prices for sessions of between 300 and 500 pesos, depending on the time involved. Actual prices were between 600 and 800 pesos. The women kept 60% to 70% of the fee. Black &amp; White had the same system of fines as Sheik, with fines for being late, not cleaning, and going over the time the client had paid for, and so on. Most fines were around 300 pesos. The women where charged 400 pesos for each of the city's health inspections.&lt;ref name="fallo"/&gt; The brothel transported women to [[Ushuaia]] by buying their airline tickets, and the women paid the brothel back from their earnings.

According to the testimony of the managers, each women generated 900 pesos a night in earnings for the brothel.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; Since the brothel was keeping 30% to 40% of the client fees, and the women were charging between 600 and 800 pesos, and the brothel was earning money from the drinks the women sold, then the women were probably averaging two to three men per night, less than half of Kinan's estimate. That would have made traffic through the two brothel bedrooms a lot more manageable.

When the nightclub was raided, none of the women had more than fifteen pesos with them. Their earnings were held by the Morales family, "for safety."&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; If they didn't have access to a bank, the house where they lived and where they had no control over who their house mates were was probably not a secure place to keep large sums of cash. Banking with the Morales family was probably more secure than cash under the mattress.

=== Credit and debt bondage ===
Claudia Quiroga, who managed Sheik at an earlier time, paid for the airline tickets that brought the women to [[Ushuaia]], bought clothes, paid for lodging, and the women paid her back from their earnings. Kinan described this as credit extended from Quiroga personally,&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; and the owner testified at his trial that the manager at the time of the police raid paid for the women's airplane tickets out of her salary.&lt;ref name="dia04"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lasrojas.com.ar/juicio-de-alika-dia-4 | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-11 | title=Juicio de Alika. Día 4 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807045002/http://lasrojas.com.ar/juicio-de-alika-dia-4/ | archive-date=2017-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably, the women would have repaid the manager and not the nightclub. This seems to show the managers personally making loans to the sex workers. On the other hand, the managers who made loans were part owners, and there may have been no clear line between their money and the nightclub's money.

At least some of the women who worked at Sheik arrived in such a state of poverty that the nightclub or its managers had to extend credit for the airplane fare, clothes for the women to wear while working, and housing. The employees would not have been able to work at Sheik and the nightclub would not have been able to recruit and keep employees without making loans to them.

Kinan has said "Every time we said we wanted to leave, we were told that we could not because we had debts,"&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; which suggests that employees were bound to the nightclub by [[debt bondage]]. Furthermore, the nightclub held the women's documentation,&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; which may have made it difficult to travel or leave the nightclub. However, Kinan was working at the Black &amp; White in 1996, which means she changed employer just a few months after she started working at Sheik.&lt;ref name="sola"/&gt; Without an accounting of the women's debts and a record of their movement between employers and into and out of the city, it's impossible to know how bound to their employers the women were.

[[Debt bondage]] usually involves high interest rates, which sometimes cause the debt to grow faster than it can be paid off. However, none of the available information on loans made to Sheik's employees mention interest. That, plus the personal nature of the loans, suggests that the nightclub wasn't making money off the loans. On the other hand, it's entirely possible that managers tried to stop women from leaving before they had repaid loans owed to the managers personally.

The many and intrusive fines could have been a cause of debt bondage. If the fines were levied often enough they could have caused the women's debts to grow faster than they could pay them off. But again, the women seemed to move between brothels on their own initiative. The fines seemed to be more effective as a means of control while the women were employed than as a means of keeping them from leaving employment.

When Kinan first arrived in [[Ushuaia]], the city was at the end of a manufacturing boom. Factory wages in [[Ushuaia]] were twice as high as they were in [[Buenos Aires]]. [[Baumol's cost disease]] indicates that service wages, including sex work wages, would also be doubled. But the cost of living was three times as high, meaning that both factory and service workers were earning less in real terms.&lt;ref name="trouble"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.luxner.com/cgi-bin/view_article.cgi?articleID=122 | dead-url=no | date=1995-07-02 | title=Trouble in world's southernmost city | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170729131819/http://www.luxner.com/cgi-bin/view_article.cgi?articleID=122 | archive-date=2017-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During both periods that Kinan was working in [[Ushuaia]] as a sex worker, the cost of living was higher than more northern parts of Argentina. Anyone moving there for higher wages would discover that they were having trouble retaining the extra money they were earning. When the women at Sheik complained about not being able to hold on to a single peso, their complaints may have been due as much to the cost of living as to the fines and costs the brothel was imposing on them.

=== Children ===
{{ quote | text=I arranged for my daughters to be cared for away from me, so that they would not see the mother they had.

[After the raid] all I wanted was to be with my daughters&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; }}

Aside from feelings of shame, it simply would not have been possible to raise children in the brothel. The shared living spaces, the presence of clients and the sexual services provided in the living spaces, the working hours that extended to 6 am or later, and the sale of alcohol all ruled out the presence of children.

All of the women were mothers and all of them were living apart from their children. When Kinan's life was turned upside down by the police raid, her first impulse was to return to her children. A full understanding the situation of Kinan and her coworkers would require an accounting of child care costs, knowing who provided child care and on what terms, and the complex of contradictory feelings they had toward their job and their children. That information isn't available.

=== Leaving employment ===
==== Sheik ====
As mentioned in the Recruitment section, sex workers in [[Ushuaia]] were recruited from all over Latin America, and Sheik itself had at least one recruiter. None of the available sources talk about leaving employment, but the presence of a recruiter shows that recruitment required more effort than the managers could devote to it on their own. Sheik employed only seven women and wasn't expanding its workforce, which indicates that women were leaving as fast as they were being recruited. As the city of the world closest to Antarctica, [[Ushuaia]] is isolated, has a harsh climate, and a small population. It doesn't attract a lot of people, making it necessary for the brothels to recruit from many countries to replace women leaving the city.

According to Kinan, women who behaved badly passed to other businesses where working conditions were worse.&lt;ref name="sinFin"/&gt; The owner of Sheik testified during the trial that he had had problems with Kinan and another woman and had intended to fire them.&lt;ref name="dia04"/&gt; However, he never did, which suggests that he would have had trouble replacing them.

As mentioned above, Kinan changed employers once and left the brothel to move to [[Spain]]. The owner of Sheik reported hiring from other brothels and getting phone calls from women who wanted to work for him. If the constant debts and the withholding of documentation were intended to bind the workers to their employers, the measures weren't entirely successful.

==== Black &amp; White ====
If, as indicated in the Recruitment section above, Black &amp; White was recruiting three new employees every month, then it was also losing three employees every month. Women were leaving six months after they were hired. Victor Morales' less-than-honest recruitment pitch resulted in some women leaving as soon as they arrived. The woman who was unnerved by the security cameras simply lifted the chain and walked out the door.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt;

One might imagine that the women who stayed would be the ones who had previous experience with sex work and were used to the work, but that's not necessarily the case. The two sex workers recruited from [[Rosario]] left at the first opportunity.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt;

One of the women taken into custody during the raid was about to be transferred to another province because "she was a problem for the owner," according to one of her coworkers.
&lt;ref name="saltena"&gt;
{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another woman was told that she was going to be sent to [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="rossi"/&gt; There's no mention of anyone actually being sent to another location, so these may have been empty threats made in an attempt to control someone's behavior.

While employed, the women didn't have possession of their earnings, which were held by the Morales family.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; This gave the managers an obvious way of collecting debts, provided the debt wasn't larger than the money the family held. In theory, the managers could have tried to prevent women from leaving the brothel by threatening to withhold their earnings, but none of the women appear to have complained about this happening. The fact that the cycle of recruitment and exit was so routine suggests that their exits were usually mutually agreed upon and the women left with their money.

The brothel held the identification documents of its employees. Almost all of them were at the bar in the nightclub, although a few were held in the owner's home.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; Getting a certificate of loss of documentation from the police is a matter of routine. The government of Argentina currently promises to provide replacement DNI cards within fifteen days of receiving an application. In the days of the ''libreta'' it reportedly could be done in a week to six weeks if there were no problems. Someone leaving the brothel and leaving their ID booklet behind could probably get a replacement.

The underage immigrant sex worker mentioned earlier that Morales recruited to work at the brothel doesn't seem to have been bound to the brothel when the managers held her documentation. When Morales recruited her, she was a seventeen year old immigrant from Paraguay who had been doing sex work prior to meeting him. She worked for him for two and a half years before leaving and making her way back to [[Buenos Aires]]. Several months after returning to [[Buenos Aires]] and just shortly before the police raid on Black &amp; White, Morales showed up on her doorstep asking her to come back to the brothel.&lt;ref name="polemicas"/&gt; She was clearly an employee that Morales wanted to keep, but either he returned her documentation when she wanted to leave, or lack of documentation didn't stop her from leaving and traveling across the country. If she returned to [[Buenos Aires]] without documentation, she either had it replaced or managed without it.

At both Sheik and Black &amp; White, fines, debt, and confiscating ID documentation may have helped managers control employee behavior, but they don't seem to have been particularly effective in preventing women from leaving. The ones that stayed the longest seemed to be the ones that had the worst job prospects. Alika Kinan and the Paraguayan immigrant both started sex work at seventeen because they couldn't support themselves any other way. Both came to [[Ushuaia]] in search of better paid sex work. Both left after working in the brothels for roughly three years. Kinan returned after eleven years of marriage left her with three children and no better job prospects. Length of employment seems to have had more to do with poverty and lack of alternative jobs than anything else.

=== Self-image ===
Immediately after the police raid at Sheik, all of the women denied being victims of trafficking and stated that they were sex workers who had been hired to do sex work.&lt;ref name="procesaron"/&gt; Two of them, Alika Kinan and another woman who has not been publicly identified, changed their minds and testified as victims during the trial, which occurred four years after the raid.

Kinan described herself and her coworkers at the time of the police raid:

{{ quote | text=We felt like criminals.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt;

When the rescue occurs I deny that I am a victim of trafficking, I said that I was not a victim and that I wanted to leave. I had just been taken from where I was and was my only source of income. At that time I had four daughters and I wanted to run and look for them and I felt guilty, I felt that I had committed a crime ...&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

On her work:

{{ quote | text=The concept I had was that the bitch is the one who goes to bed with someone and does not charge, so I'm a prostitute because I lie down and I charge, inside everything I was proud of that.

== Victim ==
In October 2012 Argentinian authorities raided Sheik.&lt;ref name="esclava" /&gt; Kinan and six other people retained were determined by the prosecuting authorities to be trafficking victims.&lt;ref name="denouncer" /&gt; This made her angry, but she gradually came to agree. She says that the thing that led her to change her mind was a question from the prosecutor's secretary:

{{ quote | text=If you analyze your history, that of your mother, that of your grandmother, that of your aunts, what do you think Is it going to be the destiny of your daughters?&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; }}

This was followed by what she describes as a long, agonizing process of self-reflection.

{{ quote | text= The first year is terrible, it is a process of denial, you can not believe everything that is happening to you, you are trying to reconcile at a family level, a series of things, and it is not easy.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

The city of [[Ushuaia]] supplied her with housing for one month and twenty days.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt; The house had been declared uninhabitable by the Ministry of Social Development several months previously.

At one point Kinan says her family almost died from fumes from a faulty water heater. The authorities response was to shut off the gas, leaving them without heating.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; (Mean temperature in [[Ushuaia]] in the warmest month of the year is below 50&amp;nbsp;°F.) When the city tried to evict her at the end of the term,&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; she turned to the María de los Angeles Foundation (founded by the mother of [[Marita Verón]]) for help, and the foundation's lawyers informed her that she was entitled to decent housing, work, subsidies, and to be reinserted into society.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt; Kinan said:

{{ quote | text=I go back to the prosecution and I tell them that I was pressured to recognize myself as a victim and that now nobody wanted to represent me, that I had no psychologist and was in a house without heating. They destroyed me, made me recognize something that I never wanted to recognize, and when I recognize it, it turns out that I do not have the rights.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; }}

Through the intervention of governor Fabiana Ríos, Kinan was granted a plot of land by the city of [[Ushuaia]] and a subsidy of 250,000 pesos to build a house. She signed a contract for 259,224 pesos for the house construction, but the contractor was apparently unable to carry out the contract. As the Court of Accounts was setting a deadline and threatening to sue for return of the subsidy, the State Attorney filed a case for eviction, to remove Kinan and her family from the temporary housing she was living in until the new house was built.

Her lawyer claimed that the necessary documents had been filed a month previously. He pointed out that it's not possible to build a house in [[Ushuaia]] for 250,000 pesos, and the prefab housing company Kinan signed a contract with couldn't meet the city's documentation requirements. In the end, he was able to stave off the eviction, but Kinan's temporary house continued to be unheated.

Kinan became a [[complainant]] in the criminal case against her managers, and simultaneously filed a civil suit against her ex-managers and the municipality of [[Ushuaia]].&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; The legal theory behind the civil suit seems to have been the following: The city conducted regular medical exams on each sex worker in the city's brothels and recorded the results in a book the city maintained for each sex worker. In doing this with each of the city's prostitutes, the city regularized prostitution and became legally complicit in any trafficking that occurred. When her ex-managers were convicted of trafficking in the criminal case, the city became liable for the harm Kinan suffered as a prostitute under the city's jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="denouncer"/&gt;

A social worker writing the initial report on Kinan concluded that she had not been a victim because she had not been submissive. When Kinan came to view herself as a victim, she made a claim to the authorities for her rights as a victim of [[trafficking]], but was not recognized. She appealed to the courts, which refused her because the judge held that she had consented. At the next level of appeal, the [[appellate court]] found that there was a possibility that she had been a [[trafficking]] victim, but since she had not declared herself a victim when her employer was raided, she could not do so now.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt; None of the available sources describe how this was resolved, but eventually she was recognized as a victim.

== Leadup to trial ==
On November 19, 2011, a woman from [[Tucumán province]] in [[Argentina]] filed a complaint, claiming that she had been exploited in a brothel called Sheik in [[Ushuaia]]. She claimed that she lived there with other women, between the ages of twenty one and twenty eight, who were natives of Argentine, the Dominican Republic, and Colombia. On April 12, 2012, the head of Prosecutor's Office for Trafficking and Exploitation of Persons filed a formal complaint in the Federal Court of Ushuaia against the brothel.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
After an investigation, the National Gendarmerie raided the nightclub on October 8, 2012.&lt;ref name="operativo"/&gt;

The lead up to the trial involved the usual legal maneuvering. Originally there were six defendants, but three were dismissed by the investigating judge. The first of these was Claudia Quiroga, Pedro Montoya's ex-wife, who owned the property where Sheik was located and had been Montoya's business partner. The second was Corina Sánchez, who had been the on-site supervisor. These two were no longer involved with the brothel at the time of the raid. The third person dismissed from the trial was Jorge Etcheverry, recruiter and brother of Ivana García, Montoya's girlfriend and business partner when the raid occurred.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt;

Kinan's lawyer objected to the dismissals. The investigating judge had postponed Kinan's testimony repeatedly, and eventually dismissed the three without evidence from Kinan. Her lawyer insisted that Kinan could "provide evidence, new data, more information regarding these accused and what their responsibility is."&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; She appealed the dismissals, but they were sustained and the trial headed for the court date with only three defendants.

A week before the trial began, Kinan's sister and ex-husband began criticizing her publicly. The sister, Maria Fernanda, who still lives in Europe, sent Kinan's ex-husband a video&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt; of a sexual scene in which the female was purportedly one of Kinan's daughters. It was later proved that the video did not involve her daughter.
&lt;ref name="necesitan"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Kinan's sister claimed that she had received it from someone in [[Ushuaia]]. Maria Fernanda said there was no truth in her sister's claims and she was concerned for her nieces. Kinan's ex-husband released the video to a journalist and claimed that his daughters were at risk. He was living in Scotland and said he couldn't afford to travel to [[Ushuaia]], but offered to testify against his ex-wive via videoconference.&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt;

She also began getting threats.&lt;ref name="denouncer"/&gt; On a street in downtown [[Ushuaia]], a group of people shouted ""Be careful what you are going to say at the trial." She received threats and insults on her cell phone and through her Facebook account. The trial prosecutor called the threats "a well organized operation." The week before the trial she felt so threatened that she kept herself and her family in the house.
&lt;ref name="amenazan"&gt;

The police guarded her house until the beginning of the trial, and she joined a witness protection program.&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt;

On a positive note, she got a new personal lawyer for the trial, a woman she felt she could trust: Marcela Rodríguez, the coordinator of the Counseling and Sponsorship Program for Victims of Trafficking in Persons of the Office of the Ombudsman. And a large number of number of social and feminist organizations organized in her support.&lt;ref name="amenazan"/&gt;

== Trial ==
Because she continued to receive threats during the trial, Kinan's protectors restricted her movement and communication. One observer pointed out that the people eventually convicted of trafficking her were not detained and enjoyed complete freedom of movement and communication.&lt;ref name="unaVezMas"/&gt;

Argentina doesn't have separate civil and criminal courts, and the civil and criminal cases against Kinan's managers at the nightclub Sheik were carried out simultaneously before the same panel of judges. During the trial, Kinan testified in a Gesell chamber, so that the accused were not able to witness her testimony.&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt; A witness known only as "F" testified under the same conditions.&lt;ref name="finalizo"/&gt;

=== Criminal trial ===
The defendants were charged with violating [[Argentina]]'s anti-trafficking law. The law has a four part test for trafficking: recruitment; transport; receiving and/or harboring persons; and exploitation. (See [[Human trafficking in Argentina]].) The prosecution claimed that the defendants recruited by advertising in media, they transported their victims by advancing money for their plane tickets, and they received and harbored them by meeting them at the airport and bringing them to the brothel and housing them there. To show exploitation they claimed that the victims had characteristics of social vulnerability when recruited, and that they were bound to the brothel by debts and rules that compromised their ability to leave when they chose.&lt;ref name="procesaron"/&gt;

The prosecutors argued that requiring the women to use a sponge during menstruation was proof that the women weren't working willingly. (Many independent escorts use a sponge so their clients won't know that they're menstruating, and some prefer the sponge to the usual tampons and sanitary napkins. However, women vary a lot in the pain they experience during menstruation. Even a woman who usually doesn't have problems may have a bad month. Escorts participating in a discussion of this on an on-line forum said that forcing women to work when they feel bad or need rest is exploitative, even if the sponge itself isn't a problem.
&lt;ref name="sponge0"&gt;

| access-date= 2017-08-03
}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Kinan's lawyer argued that the defendants' actions violated the 1949 UN protocol on trafficking, which [[Argentina]] has signed. (See [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]].) She pointed out that under the protocol, a victim's consent is immaterial.&lt;ref name="juicio"/&gt;

Montoya's lawyer made the following arguments:

{{ quote | text=[The night club was a] duly authorized establishment and the accusation of sex in exchange for money has not been proven and there were no places where they had sex. There is no concrete proof of these federal crimes.&lt;ref name="vigencia"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

He pointed out that Montoya had faced a similar charge in the provincial court in 2011 and the case had been dismissed.

{{ quote | text=... now the same complaint has been reissued in Federal, therefore we will ask for acquittal.&lt;ref name="vigencia"/&gt; }}

Excerpts from Pedro Montoya's testimony:

{{ quote | text=I am being tried for a crime that I consider to be aberrant. I do not consider that I have deviated from the law. I do not see them as victims but rather as majority partners. I am the minority partner of the ladies.

[Trafficking] is a fashionable crime.

This is a trade in which we take advantage of both of a man's needs, because the man needs to go to a place to look for company. The public goes and the women act as psychologists ... Sometimes men went after spending forty days on board.

The girl is in the capacity of entertainer because they are to entertain and be a companion of a person. It is a service of accompaniment or entertainment that is framed in the Collective Agreement of Work according to an ordinance of the Deliberating Council.

[Clients] had to pay the value of a glass for the time that they were going to be absent from the place ... I consider relationships outside the nightclub to be an agreement between two people, it is not my problem.

There was no [criminal] organization here at all. This business made me tired, it caused me psychophysical discomforts and even losses sometimes.&lt;ref name="socio"/&gt;

I asked my lawyer and he answered that we were not guilty of any crime and we were under the ordinances in force, subject to inspections, of all the Armed Forces, Gendarmerie, Police, Migrations, Public Ministry of Labor, Sadaic, Capif, DGR Province and, of course, Municipality Of Ushuaia, licensing organs that always inspected the commercial activity carried out. I always thought I was doing a lawful job.&lt;ref name="vigencia"/&gt; }}

=== Civil trial ===
A team of psychologists and psychiatrists asserted that Kinan suffered from [[PTSD]] which caused sleep disorders and made her afraid of embracing and of touching things that had passed through many hands, such as money. They recommended psychological counseling three times a week for twenty years, which would cost 2,496,000 pesos at current prices. In addition, scars on her face and missing teeth were physical evidence of the violence she had suffered. The experts testified that Kinan is expected to be 70% incapacitated.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt;

The municipality of [[Ushuaia]] argued that it had no legal liability because any laws and international treaties violated by the brothel's actions fell under the jurisdiction of the federal and provincial governments, and the city's actions had all been consistent with law. It also pointed out that it was cooperating with a foundation created by Alika Kinan for the purpose of assisting victims of trafficking.&lt;ref name="juicio"/&gt;

The doctor from Ushuaia Regional Hospital who issued the health books testified. When asked if she ever issued health books to men, she said she only issued them to women and "sex change."&lt;ref name="finalizo"/&gt;

== Outcome of trial ==
On 30 November 2016, the court decided in Kinan's favor. The city of [[Ushuaia]] was ordered to pay Kinan 780,000 [[Argentine peso|pesos]] (about US$47,000.) The owner of Sheik received a [[prison sentence]] of seven years and a fine of 70,000 pesos. His girlfriend/business partner got a three-year [[suspended sentence]] and a fine of 30,000 pesos. The woman who managed the club received a three-year [[suspended sentence]].

As part of the suspended sentences, the court placed restrictions on where the two women could reside, required them to avoid overconsumption of alcohol, and ordered them to refrain from using narcotics.

The [[prosecutor]] stated that even though the penalties were less than the prosecution had requested, the [[verdict]] was a change in the way the [[judicial system]] viewed [[sex trafficking]].&lt;ref name="sentencia"/&gt;

== Epilogue ==
On 1 December 2016, the court published the grounds for its decision. At that point the convicted exercised their right of [[appeal]] and remained free. Kinan continues to feel anxiety over the outcome and she's also still getting threats.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The protective personnel provided by the government Program for Rescue were withdrawn.&lt;ref name="unaVezMas"/&gt;

The [[Ushuaia]] city counsel ended the licensing of brothels in 2013, effectively putting them all out of business.&lt;ref name="privados"/&gt; Many of the women left to continue [[sex work]] elsewhere. Most of them went to [[Punta Arenas]] in [[Chile]].&lt;ref name="denouncer"/&gt; A ferry service connects [[Punta Arenas]] with the island of [[Tierra del Fuego]] where [[Ushuaia]] is located, making it easy to move there. The brothels of southern [[Chile]] are active, operate similarly to the ones driven out of [[Ushuaia]],&lt;ref name="otherMenus"/&gt; and [[Punta Arenas]] is visited by the same types of ships that gave [[Ushuaia]] many of its customers for its sex business.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt;

The women left, but they've been replaced. There are still places where you can rent a room for an hour. There's a wider variety of business models, but the dominant one is reportedly the private apartment. While Kinan and her coworkers lived two to a room, the new model is three to an apartment. If sex workers in [[Ushuaia]] benefited from closing the brothels, it was primarily from the change in housing; they now have hot water. Women still come from the same places far away from [[Ushuaia]], but they rotate in and out faster. Advertising is done on the web, where the pictures and names change, but the phone numbers stay the same. Periodically, the police raid an apartment and liberate its occupants, rendering them homeless until they can reconnect with their pimps. While they are working for their pimps, they are plagued by the same system of debts that plagued Kinan and her coworkers. When the police liberate them, they become homeless mothers with no way of supporting their children.&lt;ref name="privados"/&gt; Kinan believes that the official count of rescued women is inflated because many of the women have been rescued one or more times previously.

{{ quote | text=Why do the victims relapse? Because they have no resources, because there are no public policies, because politicians make policy under the banner of "Not One Less" but they haven't filed even one bill that protects women. The trafficking law came without legs, it doesn't function. I am grateful because it rescued me and freed me from a brothel, helped me grow as a militant and empower me. But after I was released, after being told that I was a victim all these years and that I had to go home with my daughters I thought "What do I live for? What I do?" The Law of Trafficking doesn't work without public policies, that is to say, access to housing, therapeutic psychological support for victims of trafficking, reintegration into genuine work and access to education.&lt;ref name="extrema"/&gt; }}

Kinan currently works at the National University of San Martín, in Buenos Aires, doing research and giving lectures on human trafficking, and organizes activities related to the same topic.

== Kinan on sex work ==
Kinan is an abolitionist opposed to decriminalization. She believes that trafficking can only be abolished by giving women the things that she herself has struggled for.

{{ quote | text=I always insist, when you ask me if I am an abolitionist, yes, I am because I am convinced that if a woman in a state of vulnerability, who is being sexually exploited, you give her or she is given a series of instruments to defend herself in life, education, a well-paid job, not one in the informal economy where she earns little, decent housing where she can support her family even though she is single, I'm sure that woman does not prostitute herself, I'm totally convinced she does not arrive at prostitution. Then, by that point, I consider myself an abolitionist ...&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

In Kinan's view, women enter sex work because they lack housing, jobs, and education. But she also views sex workers as trapped by not understanding that they are victims and have rights.

{{ quote | text=Because you are very afraid, you are not sure if you are a victim or you are not a victim, you don't become aware if you are a victim, if you knew that you were a victim, you would ask for help immediately. Social myth is "Why don't these women who are locked up ask for help at the time? Why don't they come out screaming that they are in these places where they are being exploited sexually, if as a society we know this is wrong?" Because the victims do not know, because they have a great ignorance about international treaties signed by our country, there is a great ignorance that our country is abolitionist.&lt;ref name="carne"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

For Kinan, the alternative to abolishing sex work is regulating it. Her experience of regulation was the medical exams at [[Ushuaia]], where physicians authorized by the city ridiculed and disparaged the sex workers they were examining. This combined with similar treatment from clients leads her to place regulators and clients in interlocking roles.

{{ quote | text=The Municipality set up the sanitary notebooks, very much like Senasa or bromatological analysis. [SENASA is the federal food safety agency in Argentina.] Did you see when you go to buy meat in the supermarket? There you walk down the aisle and you see that everything has passed through sanitary inspections, and that the meat is fit for human consumption. And you are one more piece of meat. The client of prostitution enters the premises and says I'm having a ribeye, or a piece of beef, a hamburger. You feel like the merchandise that has given up its own will, to be consumed, to be raped.&lt;ref name="carne"/&gt; }}

Kinan wants to attack commercialized sex in three steps. First is the end of government regulation and shutting down sex-related businesses via the existing anti-trafficking law. The next step is to eliminate the commodity being sold by giving women the resources that make it unnecessary for them to turn to sex work for survival.

{{ quote | text=At the moment the most important thing is to be able to conjoin the Law of Trafficking with real public policies, that restore the rights of the victims in terms of housing and labor solutions. And the supportive therapy and the ability to provide them with education.&lt;ref name="carne"/&gt; }}

Failure to take this step means that women return to their traffickers.

{{ quote | text=When we talk about Human Rights, it is wonderful that we have the closure of brothels, which are clandestine and non-clandestine centers of torture and sexual exploitation, but what do we do to avoid having the same victim show up in later raids, as has happened?&lt;ref name="carne"/&gt; }}

The final step is to eliminate the buyer by criminalizing the client, but this must proceed from the second step described above, which Kinan calls "the restoration of rights."

{{ quote | text=We have a lot of work ahead of us, regarding the restoration of rights, of women who are victims of trafficking and from there to be able to advance in a direct line on the criminalization of the client of prostitution.&lt;ref name="carne"/&gt; }}

Argentina has a union of sex workers called Ammar that is part of CTA, a trade union federation. As a sex worker, Kinan saw herself as a strong woman doing a difficult job, but she now believes that viewpoint is a part of victimization.

{{ quote | text=I saw myself as a strong woman who had come there because I had no choice, a concept that is also part of the crime of trafficking, because that is what you are made to believe when you enter the circuit.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt; }}

She has no sympathy for Ammar or other sex worker rights organizations, viewing them as essentially the same as the managers at the brothels where she worked.

{{ quote | text=For me Ammar is a union and acts as such, these women have never stood at the street corners, none of them are kept in the brothels as victims, but they have presided over brothels and have presided over women. My personal opinion is that they are trying to take care of their backs for future raids that are made for the crime of trafficking. It is not innocent that they have gone from claiming rights and guarantees as autonomous prostitutes and today demand the reopening of brothels. Argentina and the Constitution are abolitionist, where clearly we are not going to allow prostitution to exist on behalf of others.&lt;ref name="carne"/&gt; }}

== Discrepancies ==
Part of Alika Kinan's story is the fact that news sources report things about her that are contradicted by other sources. Since there's no way of knowing why different information is being reported a different times, nothing in this section should be taken as evidence that anyone is intentionally being untruthful.

=== Age of arrival at Ushuaia ===
In at least two different interviews, Kinan has apparently said that she was eighteen years old when she arrived at [[Ushuaia]].
&lt;ref name="desesperado"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="honoree"/&gt; Another source said she was fifteen.&lt;ref name="distinguida"/&gt; She was reportedly born on June 24, 1976.&lt;ref name="calvario"/&gt; She has said that she was thirty six when Sheik was raided in 2012,&lt;ref name="desesperado"/&gt; and in 2017 she said that she was forty one,&lt;ref name="honoree"/&gt; both of which would be consistent with a 1976 birth date. Various sources state that she came to [[Ushuaia]] to work at Sheik in 1996.&lt;ref name="juicio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="calvario"/&gt;&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt;&lt;ref name="desesperado"/&gt;&lt;ref name="extrema"/&gt;&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sinFin"/&gt; So she was either nineteen or twenty, and in either case closer to her twentieth birthday than her nineteenth.

=== Time in sex work ===
One source says Kinan was trapped by prostitution for twenty years.&lt;ref name="extrema"/&gt; Another says that she was trapped in a brothel for nearly twenty years.&lt;ref name="honoree"/&gt; Another claims that she was "a victim of trafficking networks and male clients for two decades."
&lt;ref name="mundial"&gt;

|archive-date= 2017-06-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
And another says she was "a victim of forced prostitution for 16 years."&lt;ref name="distinguida"/&gt;

She did sex work in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] for three years, worked in brothels in [[Ushuaia]] for three years, and after returning to [[Ushuaia]] from [[Spain]], worked in one brothel for another two years. These three time periods add up to about eight years.

=== Number of brothels ===
When news reports say that Kinan was trapped in a brothel for twenty years, they're referring to the brothel named Sheik. In [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], she worked at a brothel named Aries.&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; In [[Ushuaia]], she worked at both Sheik&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="calvario"/&gt; and Black &amp; White.&lt;ref name="redito"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sola"/&gt;

=== Entrapment ===
On the subject of entrapment, a writer familiar with the details of Kinan's history wrote that "Alika Kinan was not kidnapped or cheated..."&lt;ref name="incomoda"/&gt;

One news report says that she was held prisoner.
&lt;ref name="heldInBrothel"&gt;
{{ cite news

|archive-date= 2017-06-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The sources cited use the word "trapped" in a context implying some sort of physical coercion. In [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] she didn't live in the brothel. The brothel work paid for the place she rented for herself and her younger sister.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; While working at Black &amp; White she rented another place for her sister, indicating that she could travel around the city and conduct business.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; While working at Sheik, she had keys to the entrance to her living quarters. She worked under abusive and expolitative conditions, compelled by poverty and the need to support people dependent on her. But she has ruled out physical coercion in two different interviews.&lt;ref name="extrema"/&gt;&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt;

As far as trickery or deceptive recruiting is concerned, in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] there was no need for the brothel to recruit her. She and her sister were starving, she was desperate, and she had no alternatives. She went to [[Ushuaia]] to work at Sheik because they paid better.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; It's not clear why she moved from Sheik to Black &amp; White, but at Sheik she kept fifty percent of the client fees and at Black &amp; White she kept sixty to seventy percent. Also, the women at Black &amp; White didn't have to entertain their clients in their living quarters.&lt;ref name="fallo"/&gt;

=== Number of clients per night ===
In 2015 a news report said that Kinan had up to ten or twelve clients a night.&lt;ref name="heroina"/&gt; In 2016 she estimated an average of eight clients per night.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; In 2017, she told one interviewer that she had seen fifteen to thirty men per night,&lt;ref name="honoree"/&gt; and she told another that she had twenty to thirty men per night.&lt;ref name="heroina"/&gt;

As stated in the Money section above, brothel revenue data indicates that the women working in the brothels were averaging two to three clients per night.

=== Isolation ===
According to NPR, the women working in the brothel couldn't make friends outside the brothel.&lt;ref name="honoree"/&gt; In [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], Kinan actually did have friends outside the brothel. At both brothels in [[Ushuaia]], she appears to have had freedom of movement outside the brothels. However, [[Ushuaia]] was a small city, everyone knew what she did for a living, and sex work has a lot of stigma. She probably was socially isolated, but mostly because of the stigma associated with her work.

Alpha-GPC rapidly delivers [[choline]] to the brain across the [[blood–brain barrier]] and is a biosynthetic precursor of acetylcholine.&lt;ref name="Parnetti" /&gt; It is a non-prescription drug in most countries.

==Efficacy==
Studies have investigated the efficacy of alpha-GPC for cognitive disorders including stroke and [[Alzheimer's disease]]. An Italian multicentre clinical trial on 2,044 patients suffering from recent stroke were supplied alpha-GPC in doses of 1,000&amp;nbsp;mg/day for 28&amp;nbsp;days and 400&amp;nbsp;mg three times per day for the five ensuing months. The trial confirmed the therapeutic role of alpha-GPC on the cognitive recovery of patients based on four measurement scales, three of which reached statistical significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Alpha-Glycerophosphocholine in the mental recovery of cerebral ischemic attacks.

== Production ==
Industrially, alpha-GPC is produced by the chemical or enzymatic deacylation of phosphatidylcholine enriched soya phospholipids followed by chromatographic purification. Alpha-GPC may also be derived in small amounts from highly purified soy [[lecithin]] as well from purified sunflower lecithin.

== Market==
The key companies operating in the global GPC market include Avanti Polar Lipids, Lipoid GmbH, [[VAV.in|VAV Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VAV Life Sciences launches India’s first phospholipid manufacturing plant|url=http://www.expressbpd.com/pharma/latest-updates/vav-life-sciences-launches-indias-first-phospholipid-manufacturing-plant/381484/|accessdate=January 31, 2017|agency=Express Pharma}}&lt;/ref&gt; and NOF Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2017 Global Soybean Phospholipid Market:- Avanti Polar Lipids, VAV Life Sciences, Lipoid GmbH, Cargill, Danisco and ADM|url=https://postobserver.com/2017/07/06/2017-global-soybean-phospholipid-market-avanti-polar-lipids-vav-life-sciences-lipoid-gmbh-cargill-danisco-and-adm/|accessdate=April 21, 2018|agency=PRNewswire|publisher=PostObserver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storage==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
Many users report degradation of alpha-GPC when stored openly or for long periods of time. Alpha-GPC is [[hygroscopic]] and will pull moisture in from the surrounding air. This will cause the powder to turn into what appears to be a gel. Alpha-GPC with &gt;99% purity will undergo this process at a visible rate (seconds to minutes) and thus requires minimized exposure to the air. This hygroscopic quality can cause gel capsules not fully packed with alpha-GPC to dissolve. Proper storage methods need to be used with alpha-GPC and include removing all air from the container, double bagging with plastic bags rated for chemicals (less likely to leak air), and storing bulk/excess inside the freezer. Vacuum sealed bags are highly recommended. For people accessing alpha-GPC daily it is advisable to separate a month's supply from excess and storing the excess as best as possible. Vacuum sealing a large supply into many 1 month dividends is a method positively reported by many users. It is important to note that hygroscopy is not degradation and leaves the substance still usable; however, the ability to accurately weigh a dose is no longer possible as the substance being weighed will be a mixture of powder and water. Liquefied or gelled alpha-GPC may also be indicative of poor storage and thus have an increased likelihood of actual degradation.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="981">'''Amylolytic process''' or '''amylolysis''' is the conversion of [[starch]] into [[sugar]] by the action of [[acids]] or [[enzymes]] such as [[amylase]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.de/books?id=dWCiDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA224&amp;lpg=PA224&amp;dq=%22Amylolytic+process%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Amylolytic%20process%22]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==

The amylolytic process is used in the brewing of alcohol from grains.  Since grains contain starches but little to no simple sugars, the sugar needed to produce alcohol is derived from starch via the amylolytic process.  In [[Brewing|beer brewing]], this is done through [[malting process|malting]].  In [[sake]] brewing, the mold [[Aspergillus oryzae]] provides amylolysis, and in [[Tapai]], [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]].

The '''Center for Jewish Studies Heidelberg''' (German: '''Hochschule für Jüdische Studien Heidelberg''', or '''HfJS''') is an accredited institution of higher learning, supported by the [[Central Council of Jews in Germany]] and funded by the German federal government. The HfJS operates in close cooperation with the [[University of Heidelberg]] and opens its doors to students and scholars, regardless of religious affiliation.

==History==
The center was founded by the Central Council of Jews in Germany in 1979. Already in 1971 the then State Rabbi of Baden {{ill|Nathan Peter Levinson|de}} moved to establish an educational institution for rabbis, cantors and teachers of religious education.  The institute was meant to be formed according to the tradition of the academies of the [[Wissenschaft des Judentums]] in Berlin and to entrench Jewish scholarship again in the scholarly landscape of Germany.

One year later the {{ill|Oberrat der Israeliten Badens|de}} enacted a memorandum in which Heidelberg was suggested as the designated place of residence for the facility so that the academic cooperation with the University of Heidelberg could be carried out. The Central Council of Jews in Germany acted on the proposal with the resolve to utilize the denominational orientation to establish a scholarly institution at which all interested academic parties could seek higher education.

Finally, following the resolution of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, the University of Jewish Studies in Heidelberg (HfJS) was founded in 1979 with 16 students. Designed as an academic facility, the institution has carried on its goal from the time of its conception to the present day to impart the complexity and fascination of Judaism to its Jewish and non-Jewish students at the highest academic level. Two years after the institution was founded, the HfJS received its national accreditation and subsequently achieved its right to award doctorates in 1995. Furthermore, the HfJS has been a member of the [[German Rectors' Conference|German Rectors’ Conference]] since 2007 and has been institutionally accredited by the [[German Council of Science and Humanities]] since 2009. Throughout the course of construction in the 1980s the institution’s professors were acting lecturers at other universities.  Today the HfJS has 11 professorships and just as many research assistantships.

The center serves as a reference point for political discourse, as well as for media, churches and schools. It explores a broad range of research topics within the field of Jewish Studies, including Art, Philosophy, History, Political Sciences, Modern Literatures, Linguistics, Rabbinical literature, Biblical Exegesis and Theory of Religion.

Moreover, the HfJS provides strong language training at all levels (in Biblical, Rabbinical and Modern Hebrew, as well as Aramaic and Hebrew-scripted languages, such as Yiddish and Judeo-Arabic). The HfJS has acquired academic partnerships with international universities in Israel, Austria and Sweden and regularly organizes conferences and issues a periodical publication, entitled Trumah.

==Endowed Chairs==
===Ignatz Bubis Endowed Chair of History, Religion and Culture of European Judaism===
This chair was created in 2001 in memory of the influential chairman and later president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, [[Ignatz Bubis]] (1927-1999). Currently held by {{ill|Johannes Heil (historian)|lt=Johannes Heil|de|Johannes Heil (Historiker)}}, this chair concentrates on all facets of European Judaism, from the antique period to the present day, including the diaspora of European communities at large.
The focus areas concern political, social and cultural transformation, as well as various mystical and religious movements, as are characteristic of the ever-changing course of Jewish history in Europe.

{{Semiotics}}
In [[semiotics]], a '''code''' is a set of [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] or sub-codes currently in use to communicate meaning. The most common is one's [[spoken language]], but the term can also be used to refer to any [[narrative]] form: consider the color scheme of an image (e.g. red for danger), or the rules of a board game (e.g. the military [[Sign (semiotics)|signifiers]] in [[chess]]).

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913) emphasised that signs only acquire [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] and [[value (semiotics)|value]] when they are interpreted in relation to each other. He believed that the relationship between the signifier and the signified was arbitrary. Hence, interpreting signs requires familiarity with the sets of conventions or codes currently in use to communicate meaning.

[[Roman Jakobson]] (1896–1982) elaborated the idea that the production and interpretation of texts depends on the existence of codes or conventions for communication. Since the meaning of a sign depends on the code within which it is situated, codes provide a framework within which signs make sense (see [[Semiosis]]).

==Discussion==
To that extent, codes represent a broad interpretative framework used by both addressers and their addressees to [[encode (semiotics)|encode]] and [[decode (semiotics)|decode]] the [[message]]s. Self-evidently, the most effective communications will result when both creator and interpreter use exactly the same code. Since signs may have many levels of meaning from the [[denotation (semiotics)|denotational]] to the [[connotation (semiotics)|connotational]], the addresser's strategy is to select and combine the signs in ways that limit the range of possible meanings likely to be generated when the message is interpreted. This will be achieved by including metalingual contextual clues, e.g. the nature of the medium, the [[modality (semiotics)|modality]] of the medium, the [[Stylistics (linguistics)|style]], e.g. [[academic]], [[literature|literary]], [[genre fiction]], etc., and references to, or invocations of, other codes, e.g. a reader may initially interpret a set of signifiers as a [[literal and figurative language|literal]] representation, but clues may indicate a transformation into a [[metaphor]]ical or [[allegorical]] interpretation [[Historical linguistics|diachronically]]. Distinctions of [[Social class|class]] or memberships of groups will be determined by the social identity each individual constructs through the way the language is spoken (i.e. with an [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] or as a [[dialect]]) or written (i.e. in sentences or in [[Short message service|SMS]] format), the place of residence (see [[American English|Americanisms]]), the nature of any employment undertaken, the style of dress, and nonverbal behaviour (e.g. through differentiating [[Norm (sociology)|custom]]s as to the extent of private space, whether and where people may touch or stare at each other, etc.). The process of [[socialisation]] is learning to understand the prevailing codes and then deciding which to apply at any given time, i.e. acknowledging that there is sometimes an [[ideological]] quality to the coding system, determining levels of social acceptability, reflecting current [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s and [[belief]]s. This includes regulatory codes that are intended to control behaviour and the use of some signifying codes. The human body is a means of using presentational codes through facial expressions, gestures, and dress. So words spoken may change their connotation to unacceptable if accompanied by inappropriate nonverbal signs.
The other code forms rely upon [[knowledge]] held by, and the interests of, the addressees. Specialised denotational codes may provide a more objective and impersonal form of language for mathematical, philosophical, and scientific texts. Hence, for example, the ability to read this text depends upon a more specialised form of [[vocabulary]] and different skills to those required to read a genre text detailing the investigations of a detective or the adventures of a secret agent. There are also specialised connotational and [[ideological]] codes to reflect particular social, political, moral, and aesthetic values. Musical and iconic codes would be relevant as between a work by [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and a piece of [[bubblegum pop]], and a painting by [[Rembrandt]] and a [[comic book]] by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], etc. Each medium has its own specialised codes and, by making them more explicit, semiotics is attempting to explain the practices and conventions have appeared in each form and to understand how meaning is being communicated. In return, this assists addressers to improve their techniques, no matter what their functional needs, e.g. as politicians, journalists, advertisers, creative artists, etc. Indeed, awareness leads to an intentional blending of codes for effect, e.g. an advertiser may produce a more effective campaign with a slogan, images and a jingle using lexical, social gestural, and musical codes.
In communication research and [[Media studies|media research]], the way receivers act towards the message and the way it is encoded becomes relevant, and generates different reactions: 
* In "radical reading" the audience rejects the meanings, values, and viewpoints built into the text by its makers.  
* In "dominant reading", the audience accepts the meanings, values, and viewpoints built into the text by its makers.  
* In "subordinate reading" the audience accepts, by and large, the meanings, values, and worldview built into the text by its makers&lt;ref&gt;Danesi, Marcel (2009), Dictionary of Media and Communications. M.E.Sharpe, Armonk, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Confidentiality''' involves a set of rules or a promise usually executed through [[Non-disclosure agreement|confidentiality agreements]] that limits access or places restrictions on certain types of [[information]].

==Legal confidentiality==
{{main|Privacy law}}

Lawyers are often required by law to keep confidential anything pertaining to the representation of a client. The duty of confidentiality is much broader than the [[attorney–client privilege|attorney–client evidentiary privilege]], which only covers ''communications'' between the attorney and the client.

Both the privilege and the duty serve the purpose of encouraging clients to speak frankly about their cases. This way, lawyers can carry out their duty to provide clients with zealous representation. Otherwise, the opposing side may be able to surprise the lawyer in court with something he did not know about his client, which may weaken the client's position. Also, a distrustful client might hide a relevant fact he thinks is incriminating, but that a skilled lawyer could turn to the client's advantage (for example, by raising [[affirmative defense]]s like self-defense)

However, most jurisdictions have exceptions for situations where the lawyer has reason to believe that the client may kill or seriously injure someone, may cause substantial injury to the financial interest or property of another, or is using (or seeking to use) the lawyer's services to perpetrate a crime or fraud.

In such situations the lawyer has the discretion, but not the obligation, to disclose information designed to prevent the planned action. Most states have a version of this discretionary disclosure rule under Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.6 (or its equivalent).

A few jurisdictions have made this traditionally discretionary duty mandatory. For example, see the New Jersey and Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.6.

In some jurisdictions the lawyer must try to convince the client to conform his or her conduct to the boundaries of the law before disclosing any otherwise confidential information.

Note that these exceptions generally do not cover crimes that have already occurred, even in extreme cases where murderers have confessed the location of missing bodies to their lawyers but the police are still looking for those bodies. The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] and many [[state supreme court]]s have affirmed the right of a lawyer to withhold information in such situations. Otherwise, it would be impossible for any criminal defendant to obtain a zealous defense.

California is famous for having one of the strongest duties of confidentiality in the world; its lawyers must protect client confidences at "every peril to himself [or herself]" under former California Business and Professions Code section 6068(e).  Until an amendment in 2004 (which turned subsection (e) into subsection (e)(1) and added subsection (e)(2) to section 6068), California lawyers were not even permitted to disclose that a client was about to commit murder or assault.  The Supreme Court of California promptly amended the California Rules of Professional Conduct to conform to the new exception in the revised statute.

Recent legislation in the UK curtails the confidentiality professionals like lawyers and accountants can maintain at the expense of the state.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Accountants, for example, are required to disclose to the state any suspicions of fraudulent accounting and, even, the legitimate use of tax saving schemes if those schemes are not already known to the tax authorities.

===Breach of confidence in English law===
{{main|Breach of confidence in English law}}

The "three traditional requirements of the cause of action for breach of confidence"&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{cite BAILII | litigants = Campbell v MGN Ltd | link = Campbell v MGN Ltd | court = UKHL | year = 2004 | num = 22 | parallelcite = [2004] 2 AC 457}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|[19]}} were identified by [[Robert Megarry|Megarry J]] in ''Coco v A N Clark (Engineers) Ltd'' (1968) in the following terms:&lt;ref name="coco"&gt;''Coco v A N Clark (Engineers) Ltd'' [1969] RPC 41; [1968] [[Fleet Street Reports: Cases on Intellectual Property Law|FSR]] 415.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|In my judgment, three elements are normally required if, apart from contract, a case of breach of confidence is to succeed. First, the information itself, in the words of Lord Greene, M.R. in the ''Saltman'' case on page 215, must "have the necessary quality of confidence about it." Secondly, that information must have been imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence. Thirdly, there must be an unauthorised use of that information to the detriment of the party communicating it.}}

The 1896 case featuring the royal ''accoucheur'' Dr [[William Smoult Playfair]] showed the difference between lay and medical views. Playfair was consulted by Linda Kitson; he ascertained that she had been pregnant while separated from her husband. He informed his wife, a relative of Kitson's, in order that she protect herself and their daughters from moral contagion. Kitson sued, and the case gained public notoriety, with huge damages awarded against the doctor. &lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=35541|title=Playfair, William Smoult|first=Ann|last=Dally}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical confidentiality==
Confidentiality is commonly applied to conversations between doctors and patients. Legal protections prevent physicians from revealing certain discussions with patients, even under oath in court.&lt;ref name="Coburn's"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/dr-coburns-peculiar-privi_b_308077.html Dr. Coburn's Peculiar Privilege], 2 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This [[physician-patient privilege]] only applies to secrets shared between physician and patient during the course of providing medical care.&lt;ref name="Coburn's"/&gt;

The rule dates back to at least the [[Hippocratic Oath]], which reads:  ''Whatever, in connection with my professional service, or not in connection with it, I see or hear, in the life of men, which ought not to be spoken of abroad, I will not divulge, as reckoning that all such should be kept secret.''

Traditionally, medical ethics has viewed the duty of confidentiality as a relatively non-negotiable tenet of medical practice.

===United States===
Confidentiality is standard in the United States by [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] laws, specifically the Privacy Rule, and various state laws, some more rigorous than HIPAA. However, numerous exceptions to the rules have been carved out over the years. For example, many American states require physicians to report gunshot wounds to the police and impaired drivers to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Confidentiality is also challenged in cases involving the diagnosis of a sexually transmitted disease in a patient who refuses to reveal the diagnosis to a spouse, and in the termination of a pregnancy in an underage patient, without the knowledge of the patient's parents. Many states in the U.S. have laws governing parental notification in underage abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/programs/health/aborlaws.htm Notification Laws] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090429230410/http://www.ncsl.org/programs/health/aborlaws.htm |date=29 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV confidentiality===
In the United Kingdom information about an individual's HIV status is kept confidential within the NHS. This is based in law, in the NHS Constitution and in key NHS rules and procedures. It is also outlined in every NHS employee’s contract of employment and in professional standards set by regulatory bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/healthregulators/Pages/professional-standards-authority.aspx|title=Professional Standards Authority - Home|author=|date=|website=www.nhs.uk|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National AIDS Trust's Confidentiality in the NHS: Your Information, Your Rights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nat.org.uk/media/Files/Publications/Confidentiality-July-2014_FINAL-2.pdf|title=Publications - National AIDS Trust - NAT|author=|date=|website=www.nat.org.uk|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlines these rights. All registered healthcare professionals must abide by these standards and if they are found to have breached confidentiality, they can face disciplinary action.

A healthcare worker shares confidential information with someone else who is, or is about to, provide the patient directly with healthcare to make sure they get the best possible treatment. They only share information that is relevant to their care in that instance, and with consent.

There are two ways to give consent: ''explicit consent'' or ''implied consent''. Explicit consent is when a patient clearly communicates to a healthcare worker, verbally or in writing or in some other way, that relevant confidential information can be shared. Implied consent, means that a patient's consent to share personal confidential information is assumed. When personal confidential information is shared between healthcare workers, consent is taken as implied.

If a patient doesn't want a healthcare worker to share confidential health information, they need to make this clear and discuss the matter with healthcare staff. Patients have the right, in most situations, to refuse permission for a health care professional to share their information with another healthcare professional, even one giving them care—but are advised, where appropriate, about the dangers of this course of action, due to possible drug interactions.

However, in a few limited instances, a healthcare worker can share personal information without consent if it is in the public interest. These instances are set out in guidance from the General Medical Council,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/ethical_guidance/confidentiality.asp|title=GMC - Confidentiality|work=gmc-uk.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the regulatory body for doctors. Sometimes the healthcare worker has to provide the information - if required by law or in response to a court order.

The [[National AIDS Trust]] has written a guide for people living with HIV to confidentiality in the NHS.&lt;ref&gt;http://nat.org.uk/media/Files/Publications/Confidentiality-July-2014_FINAL-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical and counseling psychology==
The ethical principle of confidentiality requires that information shared by a client with a [[therapist]] in the course of treatment is not shared with others. This principle bolsters the [[therapeutic alliance]], as it promotes an environment of trust. There are important exceptions to confidentiality, namely where it conflicts with the clinician's [[duty to warn]] or [[duty to protect]]. This includes instances of [[suicidal behavior]] or [[homicidal]] plans, [[child abuse]], [[elder abuse]] and [[dependent adult abuse]].  Recently,{{when|date=October 2015}} confidentiality laws have been changed{{by whom|date=October 2015}} so that doctors and nurses face strict penalties if they breach confidentiality.

On 26 June 2012 a judge of [[Oslo District Court]] apologized for the court's hearing of testimony (on 14 June, regarding contact with [[Child Welfare Services (Norway)]]) that was covered by confidentiality (that had not been waived at that point of the [[trial of Anders Behring Breivik]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/22juli/Tingretten-ber-Behring-Breiviks-mor-om-unnskyldning-6912500.html|title= Tingretten ber Behring Breiviks mor om unnskyldning|author= Per Anders Johansen|work= Aftenposten}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial confidentiality ==
Some legal jurisdictions recognise a category of commercial confidentiality whereby a [[business]] may withhold information on the basis of perceived harm to "[[commercial interest]]s".&lt;ref&gt;
For example: {{cite book
| last1                 = Paradissis
| first1                = Jean-Jacques
| last2                 = Purdue
| first2                = Michael
| chapter               = Access to Environmental Justice in United Kingdom Law
| editor1-last          = Harding
| editor1-first         = Andrew
| title                 = Access to Environmental Justice: A Comparative Study
| url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=gfEHqR-6i1YC
| series                = The London-Leiden Series on Law, Administration and Development
| volume                = 11
| publisher             = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers
| publication-date      = 2007
| page                  = 293
| isbn                  = 9789004157835
| accessdate            = 2015-10-20
| quote                 = Commercial confidentiality is usually defined by reference to commercial interests of the person concerned: if disclosure can 'prejudice to an unreasonable degree' commercial interests, then it must not be permitted. 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For example: Soft drink giant [[Coca-Cola]]'s main syrup formula remains a trade-secret.

== Banking confidentiality ==
{{Main|bank–client confidentiality}}

== Public policy concerns ==
Confidentiality agreements that "seal" [[Settlement (litigation)|litigation settlements]] are not uncommon, but this can leave regulators and society ignorant of public hazards. In the U.S. state of Washington, for example, journalists discovered that about two dozen medical malpractice cases had been improperly sealed by judges, leading to improperly weak discipline by the state Department of Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/special-reports/what-the-state-didnt-know-about-doctor-malpractice-suit/|title=What the state didn't know about doctor, malpractice suit|date=2006-12-13|website=The Seattle Times|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s and early 2000s, the [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|Catholic sexual abuse scandal]] involved a number of confidentiality agreements with victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/27/nyregion/albany-diocese-settled-abuse-case-for-almost-1-million.html|title=Albany Diocese Settled Abuse Case for Almost $1 Million|last=Goodstein|first=Laurie|date=2002-06-27|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states have passed laws that limit confidentiality. For example, in 1990 Florida passed a 'Sunshine in Litigation' law that limits confidentiality from concealing public hazards.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/publications/gp_solo/2012/november_december2012privacyandconfidentiality/confidentiality_settlement_agreements_is_bad_clients_lawyers_justice.html|title=Confidentiality in Settlement Agreements Is Bad for Clients, Bad for Lawyers, Bad for Justice|website=www.americanbar.org|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington state, Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana have laws limiting confidentiality as well, although judicial interpretation has weakened the application of these types of laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol154/iss2/4/|title="Quality, Not Quantity: An Analysis of Confidential Settlements and Lit" by Alison Lothes|website=scholarship.law.upenn.edu|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. Congress, a similar federal Sunshine in Litigation Act has been proposed but not passed in 2009, 2011, 2014, and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fan|first=Mary D.|date=2015-09-18|title=Private Data, Public Safety: A Bounded Access Model of Disclosure|ssrn=2662678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24132">The '''conservation and restoration of [[ivory]] objects''' is activities dedicated to the preservation and projection of ivory object that have a value either historically or personally. Within institutions of cultural heritage this role is ideally taken on by the conservator.

Ivory is relatively soft and can be worked on with nonmetal tools so it is often carved in decorative object, practical objects, and can be inlaid in other pieces. A popular decorative ivory work is [[scrimshaw]], which is etched ivory with black or colored pigments. Ivory objects have been around since [[prehistoric]] times. Its [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation]] is concerned particularly with the environmental causes of deterioration

==Ivory==

Ivory is the tusks and unusually large or projected teeth of animals, such as [[elephants]] and [[walruses]]. It consists of dentin and made up of both organic (for growth and repair) and inorganic (rigidity and strength) components. Due to it being organic and inorganic the ivory is extremely sensitive and reactive &lt;ref name="Craft"&gt;{{cite book |last = Craft | first = Meg |editor = Harriet Whelchel |title = Caring for your collections | year = 1992 |publisher= Harry N. Abrams, Incorporated |location=New York |isbn=0-8109-2558-3 |pages=96–107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of ivory===

Understanding the diverse types of ivory is important as it can impact the type of conservation and restoration work that is done. It can also determine the materials that are harmful or safe to use on the ivory.

====Elephant and mammoth====

Elephant and [[mammoth]] ivory comes from the two modified upper incisors. Tusks of some male African elephants can grow up to 2 meters (6 ½ feet) and weigh up to 45 kilograms (100 pounds). The tusks have a pulp cavity where the root and soft tissues attach to the jaw and that extends for approximately one-third of the tusk. By looking at if the carved ivory does or does not have the pulp cavity it can help indicate what part of the tusk was used and its original length.&lt;ref name= "Hornbeck"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hornbeck |first=Stephanie |year=2014  |title=Ivory: identification and regulation of a precious material  |journal= National Museum of African Art Conservation Lab  |pages=1–10  |publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of African Art |url=http://anyflip.com/zvle/rhnl/basic }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristic identifier in elephant ivory is the pattern of intersecting arcs that can be seen in the cross-section. These arcs can go by several names such as engine turnings, cross-hatchings, or Schreger lines (named after the German anatomist who first described them in 1800). The intersections of the lines form angles, obtuse arc angles are found in elephant ivory and acute arc angles are found in mammoth ivory.&lt;ref name= "Hornbeck"/&gt;

====Walrus====

Walrus ivory is solid its entire length with a center of secondary dentin instead of a pulp cavity. It is characterized in cross section by the central core that has a marbled appearance surrounded by the smooth creamy white dentin layer. They may grow up to 1.0 meter (3 ¼ feet) in length.&lt;ref name="CHIN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1439925170216 |title= Care of ivory, bone, horn, and antler - Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes 6/1 |author=Tom Stone |date=2014 |publisher=Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Warthog====

[[Warthog]] ivory comes from their upper and lower canine teeth and are strongly curved. It generally has squared cross sections and have a mottled appearance. When using a magnifying hand lens, the wart hog dentin shows irregularly spaced concentric lines with varying thickness.&lt;ref name="Ivory Identification"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fws.gov/lab/ivory_guide.php |title=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services Forensics Laboratory |author= U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Forensics Lab |date=2010 |publisher= U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Narwhal====

[[Narwhal]] ivory comes from a single left incisor that is produced by males. It is distinguished by its spiral form. They can grow from 2.0-7.0 meters (6 ½-23 feet) in length.&lt;ref name="Ivory Identification" /&gt;

====Hippopotamus====

The upper and lower canine and incisors are the most common sources for [[hippopotamus]] ivory and each one has a distinctive gross morphology. Using a magnifying hand lens, we can see tightly packed series of fine concentric lines, which can be regularly or irregularly spaced. The orientation of these lines will follow with the overall shape of the tooth. Hippo ivory is harder and opaquer than elephant or walrus ivory.&lt;ref name="Ivory Identification" /&gt;

The upper canines are curved and are oval to rounded in the cross-section. The lower canines are the largest teeth and strongly curved. In their cross-section, they are triangular. The incisors can be described as peg shaped and the center of the tooth in the cross-section shows a small dot.&lt;ref name="Ivory Identification" /&gt;

====Sperm whale and Killer whale====

Both the [[Sperm whale]] and [[Killer whale]] have conically shaped teeth with a small amount of enamel at the tips and the rest of the tooth covered by cementum. The cross-sections of the teeth are rounded or oval. A characteristic feature is that the dentin forms in layers that alternate directions giving it a banded appearance. Their teeth are second in hardness to hippopotamus ivory. Sperm whale teeth may grow up to 20&amp;nbsp;cm (8 inches) in length while the killer whale teeth are slightly smaller. Killer whale teeth show two slight peripheral indentations and may also display a faint rosette pattern in the dentin cross-section.&lt;ref name="Ivory Identification" /&gt;

====French ivory====

[[French ivory]] is a synthetic material that is typically composed of pigmented cellulose nitrate and/or casein. This type of ivory was commonly made in the late 19th century and early 20th century. It looks like elephant ivory and can have intersecting line patterns but the pattern is more uniform and regular than natural ivory. This ivory will be occasionally marked synthetic while “French Ivory” or “India Ivory” are common marks. It can be distinguished from natural ivory due to its lighter weight and more even coloring.&lt;ref name="CHIN" /&gt;

Cellulose nitrate can be identified with a chemical spot test using diphenylamine. This ivory can degrade and produce acidic and oxidizing nitrogen. Oxide gases have been known to spontaneously combust so if this type of ivory shows any deterioration it must be kept away from the rest of the collection.&lt;ref name="CHIN" /&gt;

====Vegetable ivory (ivory nuts)====

[[Vegetable ivory]] is derived from several dense palm nuts that are native to Africa, South America, and the South Pacific. It is a cellulosic material. They grow to a maximum of 5&amp;nbsp;cm (approximately 2 inches) in diameter.&lt;ref name="Hornbeck" /&gt;

====Composite mixtures====

Can be various mixtures including ivory dust and casein, ivory dust and styrene resin, calcium carbonate and adhesive, casein and hardener.&lt;ref name="Hornbeck" /&gt;

====Plastic====

A proprietary [[plastic]] of cellulose nitrate and camphor that was developed in the mid-19th century as an ivory substitute. Other examples include polyester and phenolic resins. The plastics are sometimes laminated to show a striated surface to resembles ivory but ivory’s intersecting arc pattern cannot be reproduced.
&lt;ref name= "Ivory Identification" /&gt;

===Identifying ivory and previous treatments===

====Visual examination====

Visual examination is a very useful method to identify ivory. By using the characteristics of the variety of ivories listed about in addition to images and samples often they type of ivory can be identified. It is helpful to consider the size of the object, if it is a long and uninterrupted section it is may be elephant or mammoth. The weight is another indicator as ivory and bone are heavier than shell, horn, plastics, and composite mixtures.&lt;ref name="Hornbeck" /&gt;

====Ultraviolet examination====

By using [[ultraviolet light]], it will help determine if the material is ivory or made from another material in a non-destructive way. The long wave ultraviolet light will fluoresce assorted colors or absorb the light which will help characterize the material. Ivory will fluoresce a bluish-white color as does bone and shell. Vegetable ivory will fluoresce a slightly orange color and the plastic ivory will absorb the light making it appear dull blue or matte.&lt;ref name="AIC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Ivory |title= AIC Wiki Ivory |author1=Vanessa Muros |author2=Yuri Yanchyshyn |author3= Randy S. Wilkinson |author4= Jean Portell |author5= Stephanie Hornbeck |date= 2011 |publisher= Object Specialty Group Conservation Wiki }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultraviolet light can also be used to see previous conservation materials and work done on the ivory along with possible pigmentation.&lt;ref name="Passmore"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Passmore |first1= Emma |last2= Ambers |first2= Janet |year=2012 |title= Hidden, looted, saved: the scientific research and conservation of a group of Bergram Ivories from the National Museum of Afghanistan |journal= Technical Research Bulletin |volume=6 |pages=33–46 |publisher= The British Museum |url= https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/BMTRB_6_Passmore-et-al.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy====

“[[Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy]] (FTIR) is an analytical method that characterizes organic material based on the energy emitted by the bonds of specific chemical compounds comprising the composition of a sample when submitted to infrared radiation.&lt;ref name="Hornbeck" /&gt;”

FTIR can differentiate ivory from other materials, except bone, as they have a similar chemical composition. It can also help identify the chemical composition of any pigments used on the ivory along with the previous mixtures and materials used for conservation or restoration of the object.&lt;ref name="Passmore" /&gt;

====X-Radiography====

[[X-ray]] can be used to look at the type of ivory it could be, if there are two separate pieces of ivory attached to each other, if there are nails/screws holding them together either from its original creators or for restoration work.&lt;ref name="Passmore" /&gt;

====DNA analysis====

[[DNA analysis]] is a more precise method of identification as it can identify if it is an African or Asian elephant and even specific areas from within a country that the ivory may belong to. This method requires a small sample of ivory where the mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA can be isolated and compared.&lt;ref name="Hornbeck" /&gt;

==Deterioration==
Ivory is [[hygroscopic]] and [[anisotropic]], tending to shrink, swell, crack, split, and/or warp on exposure to extremes or fluctuations in [[relative humidity]] and [[temperature]], It is subject to [[light|photolytic]] color change. Its organic compounds decompose by [[hydrolysis]] with prolonged exposure to water, while its inorganic compounds are attacked by [[acids]]. Deteriorated ivory is [[porous]], [[brittle]], and prone to impact damage and [[delamination]]. Many conservation problems are caused by previous conservation treatments such as incompatible and degraded [[coatings]], [[adhesives]], and attempts at reconstruction.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.si.edu/mci/english/learn_more/taking_care/ivory.html |title= The care and handling of ivory objects |author= Smithsonian Institution |publisher= Smithsonian Institution }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preventive conservation==

===Handling===

When working with ivory objects it is important to wear white cotton gloves and if none are available be sure to thoroughly wash hands prior to touching the object.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"/&gt; Since ivory is a porous material it is susceptible to staining. Ivory will yellow and/or brown with repeated contact to skin, fatty acids, and oils.

===Temperature and relative humidity===

Ivory is a hygroscopic material meaning that is absorbs and releases moisture with changing humidity. It is very reactive to its environment with the most severe changes linking to temperature and relative humidity. The relative humidity ideally is between 45-55% and the temperature at 70˚F (21.11˚C). If the relative humidity is too low it can lead to desiccation, shrinkage, and cracking. When the relative humidity it too high is can cause warping and swelling of the ivory.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt; If the relative humidity exceeds 60% for a sustained time there is a chance that mold can develop on the ivory. It will be a white and greenish fuzzy growth that will require particular care and cleaning.&lt;ref name= "Storch"&gt;{{cite book |last=Storch |first=Paul S. |editor= Sherelyn Ogden |title=Caring for American Indian objects: a practical and cultural guide |year=2004 |publisher= Minnesota Historical Society |location=St.Paul, MN |isbn= 0-87351-505-6 |chapter= Bone, Antler, Ivory, and Teeth }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found that temperature does not have as great of an impact on the condition of ivory that relative humidity does.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt; Big fluctuations with either temperature of relative humidity is harmful. When the temperature fluctuates from normal to high heat it will cause expansion and contraction of the ivory.&lt;ref name="CHIN" /&gt; Elevated temperatures can also result in a series of color changes.&lt;ref name="Craft" /&gt;

===Lighting===

Sunlight and artificial light can damage the surface of the ivory by discoloring (patina) as well as make it more brittle. Sunlit or spotlight display cases as well as any closed cases where heat can build up from interior light bulbs will cause further damage ivory. Dark storage areas will help to prevent damage to the ivory objects.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt;

Lighting is kept at 5 foot-candles

===Integrated pest management===

Ivory is very rarely attacked by insects but benefits from being routinely inspected to ensure no pest activity. Rodents or other small mammals can cause structural damage by chewing on the surface of ivory.&lt;ref name= "Storch" /&gt;  By maintaining good housekeeping and having an [[integrated pest management]] program will help prevent infestations.

===Proper storage===

Tightly closed display cases or storage will provide protection from any sudden changes in temperature, relative humidity, dirt, and dust. Storage drawers lined with a chemically stable cushioning material, for example polyethylene or polypropylene will protect the surface of the ivory. Another option for storage is wrapping it in unbuffered, acid free tissue paper and stored in a sealed polyethylene bag. Well washed unbleached muslin or dipper fabrication can substitute the tissue. Avoid rubber based materials as it can cause unnatural yellowing of ivory.&lt;ref name="CHIN" /&gt; 
Avoid storing or displaying ivory near radiators, heat pipes, outside windows, and incandescent lights as they can cause excessive drying and temperature fluctuations.&lt;ref name= "Storch" /&gt;

==Conservation and restoration==

===Cleaning===

If the ivory object is in good stable condition, cleaning the surface of dirt and grime with is appropriate.&lt;ref name="CHIN" /&gt;

If the dusting is not enough the ivory can be cleaned with a mixture of water and mild soap (such as Ivory Snow or WA Paste). Never soak ivory as the water could cause the dirt to become more visible by embedding it into cracks or pores.&lt;ref name="Pouliot"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pouliot |first=Bruno |editors= Onie Rollins |title=The Winterthur Guide to caring for your collection |year=2009 |publisher=The Henry Francis Du Pont Winterthur Museum, Inc. |location=Delaware |isbn=978-0-912724-52-2 |chapter=Organic Materials }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many liquids can be destructive to ivory so avoid if possible or contact a professional.

===Stabilization and structural treatments===

Avoid over the counter adhesives when repairing cracks or breaks of ivory. These repairs are difficult and the use of poor adhesives can result in staining of the ivory and embrittlement as the adhesives age.&lt;ref name="Storch" /&gt;

Breaks and cracks can be important historically and show its use of the object. Unnecessary repairs can result in the loss of that historical information. Contact a conservator before any structural repairs are made.&lt;ref name="Storch" /&gt;

===Surface treatments===

Avoid wax or other protective coatings as they can age over time resulting in yellowing or darkening of the ivory surface. It can also obscure surface details that may be important to the object. The protective coatings can become difficult or even impossible to remove without damage to the object.&lt;ref name="Storch" /&gt;

If possible to remove unstable surface treatments, do so with appropriate solvents. Use caution and have a professional consulted before doing any work on the ivory.&lt;ref name="Passmore" /&gt;

===Intervention===
Especially in [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological contexts]], interventive treatment may in some cases be considered necessary. Such intervention is governed by [[conservation ethics]], in particular the principles of reversibility and [[minimum intervention]]. Possible treatments include the reduction of [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] to prevent further deterioration, and the consolidation of delaminating and friable components. Any treatment should be undertaken by a [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] professional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Ward, Gerald W.R. |title= The Grove Encyclopedia of Materials and Techniques in Art |year=2008 |publisher= Oxford University Press |pages=299–301 |isbn=978-0-19-531391-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contact a professional===

Ivory is extremely sensitive and reactive, if it is broken or extremely dirty please contact a professional conservator to conduct the repairs and extensive cleaning.

==Ethical concerns==

With the dramatic decline in population for African and Asian elephants along with [[poaching]] there are certain laws and regulations for ivory.

===Laws===

See also, [[Ivory trade]].

*The Lacey Act (1900 and later amendments) prohibits the trade of wildlife that is taken in violation of any state or foreign wildlife law or regulations. This affects interstate commerce.&lt;ref name="Hornbeck" /&gt;
*The Endangered Species Act (1973) is to help prevent the extinction of native and foreign species. It prohibits elephant parts and products from being imported into the United States except under certain conditions. Artifacts that are carved from elephant ivory may travel legally if it has documentation that proves its provenance pre-dates 1973.&lt;ref name="Hornbeck" /&gt;
*[[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] (CITES) is made up of 180 countries to eliminate the illegal trade in animals, their parts, and associated products. CITES regulations do not take place of national laws. CITES has an Ivory Control System that is focused on the ivory trade.&lt;ref name="Hornbeck" /&gt;
*The African Elephant Conservation Act (1988) prohibits raw or worked ivory to be imported into the United States with some exceptions. It also established a grant program that funds elephant conservation work.&lt;ref name="Hornbeck" /&gt;

===Transportation regulations===

As of 2016, new regulations in the United States have been put into place regarding African-elephant Ivory and Asian-elephant Ivory. It is important to understand not only the federal laws but the state laws as well, as they can differ.&lt;ref name="Ivory Laws"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/stories/articles/2015/6/22/ivory-law/ |title=Overview of Current Ivory Law |author=Ben Phelan |date= 22 June 2015 |publisher=PBS }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====African elephant ivory====
=====Import=====

Commercial Purposes: It is now illegal to import African elephant ivory (raw, worked, antique, or brand new) into the United States for any commercial purpose.

Non-Commercial Purposes: If the ivory was removed from the wild prior to February 26, 1976 and was otherwise legally acquired then the following can be imported into the United States for non-commercial purposes. 
*Musical instruments
*Items in a household move or that are part of an inheritance
*No more than two sport-hunted trophies per year (trophies must have appropriate permit that have been issued by the country hosting the hunt).&lt;ref name= "Ivory Laws"/&gt;

=====Sale &amp; export=====
Commercial Purposes: To commercially export an item containing ivory it must qualify as an antique, as defined by the Endangered Species Act. 
*The item has not been repaired or modified with ivory, or any other part of a federally protected species since 1973
*The item is at least 100 years old
*The item was either imported prior to 1982 or after 1982 through one of the 13 ports specifically designated for antiques. Or the item was manufactured in the United States from legally imported ivory.&lt;ref name= "Ivory Laws"/&gt;

Non-commercial purposes: To be eligible it must be an antique as defined by the ESA, or it but have been created prior to 1979 and has not be bought or sold since that time. It is still illegal under federal law to export raw African elephant ivory for any purpose (commercial or non-commercial)

Interstate commerce: To be eligible for legal sale across state lines it must satisfy the laws of the relevant states and either be an antique as defined by the ESA or it must have been legally important into the United States prior to 1990 and contain only a small amount of ivory (de minimis exception).

Intrastate commerce: Under federal law, it the item was legally imported before 1990 or was imported with a CITES pre-convention certificate it can be sold within a state, if it also complies with relevant state and local laws.&lt;ref name= "Ivory Laws"/&gt;

====Asian elephant ivory====

=====Import, export, &amp; interstate commerce=====
It is legal if it meets the following criteria:
*The item has not been repaired or modified with ivory, or any other part of a federally protected species since 1973
*The item is at least 100 years old
*The item was either imported prior to 1982 or after 1982 through one of the 13 ports specifically designated for antiques. Or the item was manufactured in the United States from legally imported ivory.&lt;ref name= "Ivory Laws"/&gt;

=====Intrastate commerce=====
an antique ivory can be sold within a state only if it has documentation from CITES certifying that it was imported prior to 1975.&lt;ref name= "Ivory Laws"/&gt;

====Traveling exhibition====

Worked African elephant ivory can be imported as part of a traveling exhibition if the ivory was legally acquired before February 26, 1976, it has not been transferred from one person to another for financial gain or profit after February 25, 2014, the person/group qualifies for a CITES traveling exhibition certificate, the ivory is accompanied by the CITES traveling exhibition certificate or and equivalent documents that meets the requirements. Raw African elephant ivory cannot be imported as part of a traveling exhibition.&lt;ref name="Hornbeck" /&gt;

'''Context-based learning''', CBL, refers to the use of real-life and fictitious examples in [[teaching]] environments in order to learn through the actual, practical experience with a subject rather than just its mere [[theory|theoretical]] parts. CBL is student centred approach to teaching and learning, utilising scenarios to replicate the social and political context of the students working/or potential working environment &lt;ref&gt;Trimmer, W. and Hawes, P. (2015). In Blessinger, P. and Carfora, J. Inquiry-based Learning for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) Programs: A conceptual and practical resource  a for educators. United Kingdom: Emerald&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]], CBL is often referred to as ''the Salters' approach''&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, B., Lazonby, J., Nicholson, P., Ramsden, J. and Waddington, D. (1994) Science: the Salters' Approach; a case study of the process of large-scale curriculum development, Science Education, 78 (5), 415-447, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; due to the efforts of the [[Salters' Company]] in creating teaching material in the field of [[chemistry]]. It can be generalized as: "The most important single factor influencing learning is the active engagement of the learner with the material.

'''Contrastive linguistics''' is a practice-oriented [[linguistics|linguistic]] approach that seeks to describe the differences and similarities between a pair of languages (hence it is occasionally called "''differential'' linguistics").

== History ==

While traditional linguistic studies had developed comparative methods ([[comparative linguistics]]), chiefly to demonstrate family relations between cognate languages, or to illustrate the historical developments of one or more languages, modern contrastive linguistics intends to show in what ways the two respective languages differ, in order to help in the solution of practical problems. (Sometimes the terms [[diachronic linguistics]] and [[synchronic linguistics]] are used to refer to these two perspectives.) 

Contrastive linguistics, since its inception by [[Robert Lado]] in the 1950s, has often been linked to aspects of [[applied linguistics]], e.g., to avoid [[Linguistic interference|interference]] errors in foreign-language learning, as advocated by Di Pietro (1971)&lt;ref&gt;Di Pietro, R.J. (1971) ''Language Structures in Contrast'', Newbury House.&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[contrastive analysis]]), to assist interlingual transfer in the process of [[translation|translating]] texts from one language into another, as demonstrated by Vinay &amp; Darbelnet (1958)&lt;ref&gt;Vinay, J.P. &amp; Darbelnet, J. (1958) ''Stylistique Comparée du Français et de l'Anglais'', Didier-Harrap.&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently by Hatim (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Hatim, B. (1997) ''Communication across Cultures. Translation Theory and Contrastive Text Linguistics'', University of Exeter Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[translation]]), and to find lexical equivalents in the process of compiling bilingual dictionaries, as illustrated by Heltai (1988)&lt;ref&gt;Heltai, P. (1988) "Contrastive analysis of terminological systems and bilingual technical dictionaries", ''International Journal of Lexicography'' Vol. 1(1) pp. 32-40.&lt;/ref&gt; and Hartmann (1991)&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, R.R.K. (1991) "Contrastive linguistics and bilingual lexicography", in ''Woerterbuecher/Dictionaries/Dictionnaires. International Encyclopedia of Lexicography'' ed. by F.J. Hausmann et al. (Vol. III, pp. 2854-2859), De Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[bilingual lexicography]]). 

Contrastive descriptions can occur at every level of linguistic structure: speech sounds ([[phonology]]), written symbols ([[orthography]]), word-formation ([[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]), word meaning ([[lexicology]]), collocation ([[phraseology]]), sentence structure ([[syntax]]) and complete discourse ([[textology]]). Various techniques used in [[corpus linguistics]] have been shown to be relevant in intralingual and interlingual contrastive studies, e.g. by 'parallel-text' analysis (Hartmann 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, R.R.K. (1997) "From contrastive textology to parallel text corpora: Theory and applications", in ''Language History and Linguistic Modelling. A Festschrift for Jacek Fisiak'' ed. by R. Hickey &amp; S. Puppel. De Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrastive linguistic studies can also be applied to the differential description of one or more varieties within a language, such as styles ([[contrastive rhetoric]]), dialects, registers or terminologies of technical genres.

The psychological coping mechanisms are commonly termed ''coping strategies'' or ''coping skills''. The term coping generally refers to adaptive (constructive) coping strategies. That is strategies which reduce stress. In contrast, other coping strategies may be coined as maladaptive, if they increase stress. Maladaptive coping is therefore also described, when looking at the outcome, as non-coping. Furthermore, the term coping generally refers to reactive coping, i.e. the coping response which follows the [[stressor]]. This differs from proactive coping, in which a coping response aims to neutralize a future stressor. Subconscious or non-conscious strategies (e.g. [[defence mechanism|defense mechanisms]]) are generally excluded from the area of coping.

The effectiveness of the coping effort depends on the type of stress, the individual, and the circumstances. Coping responses are partly controlled by [[personality]] (habitual traits), but also partly by the [[social environment]], particularly the nature of the stressful environment.&lt;ref name="Carver"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.093008.100352 |title=Personality and Coping |year=2010 |last1=Carver |first1=Charles S. |last2=Connor-Smith |first2=Jennifer |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |volume=61 |pages=679–704 |pmid=19572784}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of coping strategies==
Hundreds of coping strategies have been identified.&lt;ref name ="Carver"/&gt; Classification of these strategies into a broader architecture has not been agreed upon. Common distinctions are often made between various contrasting strategies, for example: problem-focused versus emotion-focused; engagement versus disengagement; cognitive versus behavioral. Weiten for instance, identifies four types of coping strategies:&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt;
* '''Appraisal-Focused''' (adaptive cognitive): directed towards challenging personal assumptions.
* '''Problem-Focused''' (adaptive behavioral): reducing or eliminating stressors.
* '''Emotion-Focused''': changing personal emotional reactions.
* '''Occupation-Focused''': directed towards lasting occupation(s), which generates positive feedback

'''Appraisal-focused strategies''' occur when the person modifies the way they think, for example: employing [[denial]], or distancing oneself from the problem. People may alter the way they think about a problem by altering their [[Objective (goal)|goals]] and [[values]], such as by seeing the [[humor]] in a situation: "some have suggested that humor may play a greater role as a stress moderator among women than men".&lt;ref&gt;J. Worell, ''Encyclopedia of Women and Gender'' Vol I (2001) p. 603&lt;/ref&gt;

People using '''problem-focused strategies''' try to deal with the cause of their problem. They do this by finding out [[information]] on the problem and learning new skills to manage the problem. Problem-focused coping is aimed at changing or eliminating the source of the stress. The three problem-focused coping strategies identified by Folkman and Lazarus are: taking control, information seeking, and evaluating the pros and cons.

'''Emotion-focused strategies''' involve:
* releasing pent-up emotions
* distracting oneself
* managing hostile feelings
* [[meditating]]
* using systematic relaxation procedures.
Emotion-focused coping "is oriented toward managing the emotions that accompany the perception of stress".&lt;ref name="Brannon &amp; Feist 2009 pp121-3"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brannon |first1=Linda |last2=Feist |first2=Jess |chapter=Personal Coping Strategies |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=NfCDR_Yl7f0C&amp;pg=PA121 |pages=121–3 |title=Health Psychology: An Introduction to Behavior and Health: An Introduction to Behavior and Health |edition=7th |year=2009 |publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-495-60132-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five emotion-focused coping strategies identified by Folkman and Lazarus&lt;ref name="Robinson 2005 p438"&gt;{{cite book |first=Jenefer |last=Robinson |title=Deeper Than Reason: Emotion and Its Role in Literature, Music, and Art |year=2005 |page=438 |isbn=978-0-19-926365-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; are:
* disclaiming
* escape-avoidance
* accepting responsibility or blame
* exercising self-control
* and positive reappraisal.
Emotion-focused coping is a mechanism to alleviate distress by minimizing, reducing, or preventing, the emotional components of a stressor.&lt;ref name="Carver, C. S. 2011"&gt;. (Carver, C. S. (2011), Coping. In R. J. Contrada &amp; A. Baum (Eds.), The Handbook of Stress Science: Biology, Psychology, and Health. (220-229). New York: Springer Publishing Company.)&lt;/ref&gt;  This mechanism can be applied through a variety of ways, such as:
* seeking social support
* reappraising the stressor in a positive light
* accepting responsibility
* using avoidance
* exercising self-control
* and distancing.&lt;ref name="Carver, C. S. 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Folkman |first1=S. |last2=Lazarus |first2=R. S. |year=1988 |title=Coping as a mediator of emotion |url= |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=466–75 |pmid=3361419 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.3.466}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The focus of this coping mechanism is to change the meaning of the stressor or transfer attention away from it.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" /&gt; For example, reappraising tries to find a more positive meaning of the cause of the stress in order to reduce the emotional component of the stressor. Avoidance of the emotional distress will distract from the negative feelings associated with the stressor. Emotion-focused coping is well suited for stressors that seem uncontrollable (ex. a terminal illness diagnosis, or the loss of a loved one).&lt;ref&gt;Carver, C. S. (2011), Coping. In R. J. Contrada &amp; A. Baum (Eds.), The Handbook of Stress Science: Biology, Psychology, and Health. (220-229). New York: Springer Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Some mechanisms of emotion focused coping, such as distancing or avoidance, can have alleviating outcomes for a short period of time, however they can be detrimental when used over an extended period. Positive emotion-focused mechanisms, such as seeking social support, and positive re-appraisal, are associated with beneficial outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ben-Zur |first1=H. |year=2009 |title=Coping styles and affect |url= |journal=International Journal of Stress Management |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=87–101 |doi=10.1037/a0015731}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emotional approach coping]] is one form of emotion-focused coping in which emotional expression and processing is used to adaptively manage a response to a stressor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology |last=Stanton |first=A. L. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-19-986216-0 |location=New York |pages=16–17 |first2=A. |last2=Parsa |last3=Austenfeld |first3=J. L. |editor-first=C. R. |editor-last=Snyder |editor-first2=S. J. |editor-last2=Lopez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, people use a mixture of several types of coping strategies, which may change over time. All these methods can prove useful, but some claim that those using problem-focused coping strategies will adjust better to [[personal life|life]].&lt;ref name="Taylor2006"&gt;Taylor, S.E. (2006). ''Health Psychology, international edition''. McGraw-Hill Education, pg. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Problem-focused coping mechanisms may allow an individual greater perceived control over their problem, whereas emotion-focused coping may sometimes lead to a reduction in perceived control (maladaptive coping).

Lazarus "notes the connection between his idea of 'defensive reappraisals' or cognitive coping and [[Freud]]'s concept of 'ego-defenses'",&lt;ref name="Robinson 2005 p438"/&gt; coping strategies thus overlapping with a person's [[defense mechanisms]].

===Positive techniques (adaptive or constructive coping)===

One positive coping strategy, anticipating a problem, is known as ''proactive coping''.&lt;ref name="Brannon &amp; Feist 2009 pp121-3"/&gt; [[Anticipation (emotion)|Anticipation]] is when one reduces the stress of some difficult challenge by anticipating what it will be like and preparing for how one is going to cope with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Robin |last1=Skynner |first2=John |last2=Cleese |title=Life and How to Survive It |location=London |year=1994 |page=55 |isbn=978-0-7493-1108-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two others are ''social coping'', such as seeking [[social support]] from others, and ''meaning-focused coping'', in which the person concentrates on deriving meaning from the stressful experience.&lt;ref name="Brannon &amp; Feist 2009 pp121-3"/&gt;

Adequate [[nutrition]], [[exercise]], [[sleep]] contribute to stress management, as do physical fitness and relaxation techniques such as [[progressive muscle relaxation]].&lt;ref&gt;Jane Madders, ''Stress and Relaxation'' (1981) p. 24-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Humor used as a positive coping strategy may have useful benefits to emotional and mental health well-being. By having a humorous outlook on life, stressful experiences can be and are often minimized. This coping strategy corresponds with positive emotional states and is known to be an indicator of mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Rod. A|title=Humor, laughter, and physical health: methodological issues and research findings|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=2001|volume=127 |issue=4|page=504}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physiological processes are also influenced within the exercise of humor. For example, laughing may reduce muscle tension, increase the flow of oxygen to the blood, exercise the cardiovascular region, and produce endorphins in the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tariq|first1=Qudsia|last2=Khan|first2=Naima Aslam|title=RELATIONSHIP OF SENSE OF HUMOR AND MENTAL HEALTH: A COORELATIONAL STUDY|journal=Asian Journal of Social Sciences &amp; Humanities|date=2013|volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=331–337}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using humor in coping while processing through feelings can vary depending on life circumstance and individual humor styles. In regards to grief and loss in life occurrences, it has been found that genuine laughs/smiles when speaking about the loss predicted later adjustment and evoked more positive responses from other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bonanno |first1= George |last2=Keltner |first2=Dacher |title= Facial expressions of emotion and the course of conjugal bereavement. |journal= Journal of Abnormal Psychology |date=1997 |volume=106 |issue=1 |page= 126}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person of the deceased family member may resort to making jokes of when the deceased person used to give unwanted “wet willies” (term used for when a person sticks their finger inside their mouth then inserts the finger into another person's ear) to any unwilling participant. A person might also find comedic relief with others around irrational possible outcomes for the deceased funeral service. It is also possible that humor would be used by people to feel a sense of control over a more powerless situation and used as way to temporarily escape a feeling of helplessness. Exercised humor can be a sign of positive adjustment as well as drawing support and interaction from others around the loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Booth-Butterfield|first1=Melanie|last2=Wanzer|first2=Melissa Bekelja|last3=Krezmien|first3=Elyse|last4=Weil|first4=Nancy|title=Communication of humor during bereavement: Intrapersonal and interpersonal emotion management strategies|journal=Communication Quarterly|date=2014|volume=62|issue=4|pages=436–454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While dealing with stress it is important to deal with your physical, mental, and social well being. One should maintain one's health and learn to relax if one finds oneself under stress. Mentally it is important to think positive thoughts, value oneself, demonstrate good time management, plan and think ahead, and express emotions. Socially one should communicate with people and seek new activities. By following these simple strategies, one will have an easier time responding to stresses in one's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lane|first1=Daniel|title=Anxiety Strategies|url=http://www.perthbraincentre.com.au/anxiety-strategies/|website=Perth Brain Centre|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tips to Manage Anxiety and Stress|url=http://www.adaa.org/tips-manage-anxiety-and-stress|website=Anxiety &amp; Depression Association of America|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative techniques (maladaptive coping or non-coping)===

While adaptive coping methods improve functioning, a maladaptive coping technique will just reduce symptoms while maintaining and strengthening the disorder. Maladaptive techniques are more effective in the short term rather than long term coping process.

Examples of maladaptive behavior strategies include [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], [[sensitization]], [[safety behaviors (anxiety)|safety behaviors]], [[Avoidance coping|anxious avoidance]], and [[Escapism|escape]] (including [[self-medication]]).

These coping strategies interfere with the person's ability to unlearn, or break apart, the paired association between the situation and the associated [[anxiety]] symptoms. These are maladaptive strategies as they serve to maintain the disorder.

Dissociation is the ability of the mind to separate and compartmentalize thoughts, memories, and emotions. This is often associated with [[post traumatic stress syndrome]].

Sensitization is when a person seeks to learn about, rehearse, and/or anticipate fearful events in a protective effort to prevent these events from occurring in the first place.

Safety behaviors are demonstrated when individuals with anxiety disorders come to rely on something, or someone, as a means of coping with their excessive anxiety.

Anxious avoidance is when a person avoids anxiety provoking situations by all means. This is the most common strategy.

Escape is closely related to avoidance. This technique is often demonstrated by people who experience panic attacks or have phobias. These people want to flee the situation at the first sign of anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacofsky|first=Matthew|title=The Maintenance of Anxiety Disorders: Maladaptive Coping Strategies|url=http://www.seabhs.org/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=38479|accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further examples===
Further examples of coping strategies include&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10615806.2011.562977 |title=Perfectionism and coping with daily failures: Positive reframing helps achieve satisfaction at the end of the day |year=2011 |last1=Stoeber |first1=Joachim |last2=Janssen |first2=Dirk P. |journal=Anxiety, Stress &amp; Coping |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=477–97 |pmid=21424944}}&lt;/ref&gt; emotional or instrumental support, self-distraction, [[denial]], [[substance misuse|substance use]], [[self-blame]], behavioral disengagement and the use of drugs or alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Albertus |first1=Sargent |title=Basic Coping Strategies For Stress |url=http://www.stress-treatment-21.com/coping-strategies-for-stress |website=Stress Treatment |accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people think that [[meditation]] "not only calms our emotions, but...makes us feel more 'together'", as too can "the kind of prayer in which you're trying to achieve an inner quietness and peace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Robin |last1=Skynner |first2=John |last2=Cleese |title=Life and How to Survive It |location=London |year=1994 |page=355 |isbn=978-0-7493-1108-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Low-effort syndrome''' or '''low-effort coping''' refers to the coping responses of minority groups in an attempt to fit into the dominant culture. For example, minority students at school may learn to put in only minimal effort as they believe they are being discriminated against by the dominant culture.&lt;ref name="Ogbu"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ogbu |first1=John U. |year=1991 |title=Minority coping responses and school experience |journal=The Journal of Psychohistory |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=433–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical psychoanalytic theories==

===Otto Fenichel===
{{Main article|Otto Fenichel}}
Otto Fenichel summarized early psychoanalytic studies of coping mechanisms in children as "a gradual substitution of actions for mere discharge reactions...[&amp;] the development of the function of judgement" - noting however that "behind all active types of mastery of external and internal tasks, a readiness remains to fall back on passive-receptive types of mastery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Otto |last=Fenichel |title=The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis |location=London |year=1946 |pages=41–2; 53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In adult cases of "acute and more or less 'traumatic' upsetting events in the life of normal persons", Fenichel stressed that in coping, "in carrying out a 'work of learning' or 'work of adjustment', [s]he must acknowledge the new and less comfortable reality and fight tendencies towards regression, towards the misinterpretation of reality", though such rational strategies "may be mixed with relative allowances for rest and for small regressions and compensatory wish fulfillment, which are recuperative in effect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Otto |last=Fenichel |title=The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis |location=London |year=1946 |page=554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Karen Horney===
{{Main article|Karen Horney}}
In the 1940s, the [[Germany|German]] [[Freudian]] [[psychoanalyst]] Karen Horney "developed her mature theory in which individuals cope with the anxiety produced by feeling unsafe, unloved, and undervalued by disowning their spontaneous feelings and developing elaborate strategies of defence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/horney-danielson-karen Bernard Paris, Horney-Danielson, Karen (1885–1952)]&lt;/ref&gt; She defined four so-called coping strategies to define interpersonal relations, one describing [[Mental health|psychologically healthy]] individuals, the others describing [[neurosis|neurotic]] states.

The healthy strategy she termed "Moving with" is that with which psychologically healthy people develop relationships. It involves compromise. In order to move with, there must be communication, agreement, disagreement, compromise, and decisions. The three other strategies she described – "Moving toward", "Moving against" and "Moving away" – represented neurotic, unhealthy strategies people utilize in order to protect themselves.

Horney investigated these patterns of neurotic needs (compulsive attachments).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Neurotic Needs According to Karen Horney|url=http://www.ptypes.com/neurotic_needs.html|accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everyone needs these things, but the neurotics need them more than the normal person. The neurotics might need these more because of difficulties within their lives. If the neurotic does not experience these needs, he or she will experience anxiety. The ten needs are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boerre|first=George|title=Karen Horney|url=http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/horney.html|accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Affection and approval, the need to please others and be liked
# A partner who will take over one's life, based on the idea that love will solve all of one's problems
# Restriction of one's life to narrow borders, to be undemanding, satisfied with little, inconspicuous; to simplify one's life
# [[Power (social and political)|Power]], for control over others, for a facade of omnipotence, caused by a desperate desire for strength and dominance
# Exploitation of others; to get the better of them
# Social recognition or prestige, caused by an abnormal concern for appearances and popularity
# Personal admiration
# Personal achievement.
# Self-sufficiency and independence
# Perfection and unassailability, a desire to be perfect and a fear of being flawed.

In Compliance, also known as "Moving toward" or the "Self-effacing solution", the individual moves towards those perceived as a threat to avoid retribution and getting hurt, "making any sacrifice, no matter how detrimental."&lt;ref&gt;Karen Horney, ''The Neurotic Personality of Our Time'' (London 1977) p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; The argument is, "If I give in, I won't get hurt." This means that: if I give everyone I see as a potential threat whatever they want, I won't be injured (physically or emotionally). This strategy includes neurotic needs one, two, and three.&lt;ref name="Boeree"&gt;{{cite web|last=Boeree|first=George|title=Karen Horney|url=http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/horney.html|accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Withdrawal, also known as "Moving away" or the "Resigning solution", individuals distance themselves from anyone perceived as a threat to avoid getting hurt – "the 'mouse-hole' attitude ... the security of unobtrusiveness."&lt;ref&gt;Karen Horney, ''New Ways in Psychoanalysis'' (London 1966) p. 254–55&lt;/ref&gt; The argument is, "If I do not let anyone close to me, I won't get hurt." A neurotic, according to Horney desires to be distant because of being abused. If they can be the extreme introvert, no one will ever develop a relationship with them. If there is no one around, nobody can hurt them. These "moving away" people fight personality, so they often come across as cold or shallow. This is their strategy. They emotionally remove themselves from society. Included in this strategy are neurotic needs three, nine, and ten.&lt;ref name="Boeree" /&gt;

In Aggression, also known as the "Moving against" or the "Expansive solution", the individual threatens those perceived as a threat to avoid getting hurt. Children might react to parental in-differences by displaying anger or hostility. This strategy includes neurotic needs four, five, six, seven, and eight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karen Horney|url=http://www.webster.edu/~woolflm/horney.html|accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to the work of Karen Horney, [[public administration]] scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tummers|first1=Lars|last2=Bekkers|first2=Victor|last3=Vink|first3=Evelien|last4=Musheno|first4=Michael|title=Coping During Public Service Delivery: A Conceptualization and Systematic Review of the Literature|journal=Journal of Public Administration, Research &amp; Theory|doi= 10.1093/jopart/muu056|url=http://jpart.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/01/12/jopart.muu056|accessdate=30 July 2015|volume=25|issue=4|pages=1099–1126|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed a classification of coping by frontline workers when working with clients (see also the work of [[Michael Lipsky]] on [[street-level bureaucracy]]). This coping classification is focused on the behavior workers can display towards clients when confronted with stress. They show that during public service delivery there are three main families of coping:

- Moving ''towards'' clients: Coping by helping clients in stressful situations. An example is a teacher working overtime to help students.&lt;br /&gt;
- Moving ''away from'' clients: Coping by avoiding meaningful interactions with clients in stressful situations. An example is a public servant stating "the office is very busy today, please return tomorrow." &lt;br /&gt;
- Moving ''against'' clients: Coping by confronting clients. For instance, teachers can cope with stress when working with students by imposing very rigid rules, such as no cellphone use in class and sending everyone to the office when they use a cellphone. Furthermore, [[aggression]] towards clients is also included here.

In their systematic review of 35 years of the literature, the scholars found that the most often used family is moving ''towards'' clients (43% of all coping fragments). Moving ''away from'' clients was found in 38% of all coping fragments and Moving ''against'' clients in 19%.

===Heinz Hartmann===
{{Main article|Heinz Hartmann}} 
In 1937, the psychoanalyst (as well as a physician, psychologist, and psychiatrist) Heinz Hartmann marked it as the evolution of [[ego psychology]] by publishing his paper, "Me" (which was later translated into English in 1958, titled, "The Ego and the Problem of Adaptation").&lt;ref name="Bendicsen2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bendicsen |first=Harold K |title=Guide to Psychoanalytic Developmental Theories |year=2009 |publisher=Springer |location=New York | isbn=978-0-387-88454-7 |pages=49–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hartmann focused on the adaptive progression of the ego "through the mastery of new demands and tasks".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ruth L. Munroe, ''Schools of Psychoanalytic Thought'' (1957) p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, according to his ''''adaptive point of view'''', once infants were born they have the ability to be able to cope with the demands of their surroundings.&lt;ref name="Bendicsen2009" /&gt;  In his wake, [[ego psychology]] further stressed "the development of the personality and of 'ego-strengths'...adaptation to social realities".&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Gregory, ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (Oxford 1987) p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

===Object relations===
[[Emotional intelligence]] has stressed the importance of "the capacity to soothe oneself, to shake off rampant anxiety, gloom, or irritability....People who are poor in this ability are constantly battling feelings of distress, while those who excel in it can bounce back far more quickly from life's setbacks and upsets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Daniel |last1=Goleman |title=Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-7475-2830-2 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, "the art of soothing ourselves is a fundamental [[life skill]]; some psychoanalytic thinkers, such as [[John Bowlby]] and [[D. W. Winnicott]] see this as the most essential of all psychic tools."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Daniel |last1=Goleman |title=Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-7475-2830-2 |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Object relations theory]] has examined the childhood development both of "[i]ndependent coping...capacity for self-soothing", and of "[a]ided coping. Emotion-focused coping in infancy is often accomplished through the assistance of an adult."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=E. Mark |editor1-last=Cummings |editor2-first=Anita L. |editor2-last=Greene |editor3-first=Katherine H. |editor3-last=Karraker |title=Life-span Developmental Psychology: Perspectives on Stress and Coping |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-8058-0371-6 |pages=93–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender differences==
Gender differences in coping strategies are the ways in which men and women differ in managing [[psychological stress]]. There is evidence that males often develop stress due to their careers, whereas females often encounter stress due to issues in interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; Early studies indicated that "there were gender differences in the sources of stressors, but gender differences in coping were relatively small after controlling for the source of stressors";&lt;ref name="Billings"/&gt;  and more recent work has similarly revealed "small differences between women's and men's coping strategies when studying individuals in similar situations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brannon |first1=Linda |last2=Feist |first2=Jess |title=Health Psychology: An Introduction to Behavior and Health: An Introduction to Behavior and Health |edition=7th |year=2009 |publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-495-60132-6 |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, such differences as exist indicate that women tend to employ emotion-focused coping and the "[[tend-and-befriend]]" response to stress, whereas men tend to use problem-focused coping and the "[[fight-or-flight]]" response, perhaps because societal standards encourage men to be more individualistic, while women are often expected to be [[interpersonal]]. An alternative explanation for the aforementioned differences involves genetic factors. The degree to which genetic factors and social conditioning influence behavior, is the subject of ongoing debate.&lt;ref name="Washburn"/&gt;

==Physiological basis==
Hormones also play a part in stress management. [[Cortisol]], a stress hormone, was found to be elevated in males during stressful situations. In females, however, cortisol levels were decreased in stressful situations, and instead, an increase in [[limbic]] activity was discovered. Many researchers believe that these results underlie the reasons why men administer a [[fight-or-flight]] reaction to stress; whereas, females have a [[tend-and-befriend]] reaction.&lt;ref name="Wang"/&gt; The "fight-or-flight" response activates the [[sympathetic nervous system]] in the form of increased focus levels, adrenaline, and epinephrine. Conversely, the "tend-and-befriend" reaction refers to the tendency of women to protect their offspring and relatives. Although these two reactions support a genetic basis to differences in behavior, one should not assume that in general females cannot implement "fight-or-flight" behavior or that males cannot implement "tend-and-befriend" behavior.

&lt;/ref&gt; Copy number variation can be detected with various types of tests such as [[fluorescent in situ hybridization]], [[comparative genomic hybridization]] and with high-resolution array-based tests based on [[array comparative genomic hybridization]] (or aCGH), [[SNP array]] technologies and high resolution microarrays that include copy number probes as well an SNPs. Array-based methods have been accepted as the most efficient in terms of their resolution and high-throughput nature and the highest coverage (choose an array with over 2 million probes)&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and they are also referred to as [[virtual karyotype]]. Data analysis for an array-based DNA copy number test can be very challenging though due to very high volume of data that come out of an array platform. 

BAC (Bacterial Artificial Chromosome) arrays were historically the first [[microarray]] platform to be used for DNA [[copy number]] analysis. This platform is used to identify gross deletions or amplifications in DNA. Such anomalies for example are common in cancer and can be used for diagnosis of many developmental disorders. Data produced by such platforms are usually low to medium resolution in terms of genome coverage. Usually, log-ratio measurements are produced by this technology to represent deviation of patient's copy number state from normal. Such measurements then are studied and those that significantly differ from zero value are announced to represent a part of a chromosome with an anomaly (an abnormal copy number state). Positive log-ratios indicate a region of DNA copy number gain and negative log-ratio values mark a region of DNA copy number loss. Even a single data point can be declared an indication of a copy number gain or a copy number loss in BAC arrays.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12105">The '''Critical Incident Technique''' (or '''CIT''') is a set of [[Procedure (term)|procedures]] used for collecting direct observations of [[human behavior]] that have critical significance and meet methodically defined criteria. These observations are then kept track of as incidents, which are then used to solve practical problems and develop broad [[psychological]] principles. A critical incident can be described as one that makes a  contribution—either positively or negatively—to an activity or phenomenon. Critical incidents can be gathered in various ways, but typically respondents are asked to tell a story about an experience they have had.

CIT is a flexible method that usually relies on five major areas. The first is determining and reviewing the incident, then fact-finding, which involves collecting the details of the incident from the participants. When all of the facts are collected, the next step is to identify the issues. Afterwards a decision can be made on how to resolve the issues based on various possible solutions. The final and most important aspect is the evaluation, which will determine if the solution that was selected will solve the root cause of the situation and will cause no further problems.

==History==
The studies of [[Sir Francis Galton]] are said to have laid the foundation for the Critical Incident Technique, but it is the work of Colonel [[John C. Flanagan]], that resulted in the present form of CIT. &lt;ref&gt; Flanagan, John C. ''Psychological Bulletin'', Vol. 51, No. 4, July 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;
Flanagan defined the Critical Incident Technique as:

{{quote|[A] set of procedures for collecting direct observations of human behaviour in such a way as to facilitate their potential usefulness in solving practical problems and developing broad psychological principles ... By an incident is meant any specifiable human activity that is sufficiently complete in itself to permit inferences and predictions to be made about the person performing the act. To be critical the incident must occur in a situation where the purpose or intent of the act seems fairly clear to the observer and where its consequences are sufficiently definite to leave little doubt concerning its effects.&lt;ref name="Flanagan54"&gt; Page 327.&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

Flanagan's work was carried out as part of the Aviation Psychology Program &lt;ref&gt; "Charged with recruiting other psychologists, Dr. Flanagan was asked to develop the Army Air Corp's program, and, by the end of the war, he had overseen the commissioning of over 150 psychologists. Within its ranks were some of the finest psychologists of the day, including five forthcoming presidents of the American Psychological Association and 11 members of its board of directors. Toward the close of the war, this group of psychologists was involved not only in conducting research regarding the selection and classification of aviators but was also involved in developing training programs and human factors engineering." http://www.apadivisions.org/division-19/publications/newsletters/military/2014/04/aviation-psychology.aspx, paragraph 6&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]], where Flanagan conducted a series of studies focused on differentiating effective and ineffective work behaviors. Flanagan went on to found [[American Institutes for Research]] continuing to use the Critical Incident Technique in a variety of research.&lt;ref&gt;A Timeline of AIR History, American Institutes for Research http://www.air.org/page/air-history&lt;/ref&gt; Since then CIT has spread as a method to identify job requirements, develop recommendations for effective practices, and determine competencies for a vast number of professionals in various disciplines. In particular, it has been used in service research.

==Principal uses==
CIT can be used in training, [[systems design]] and [[accident investigation]]. It is an integral part of large scale [[task analysis]]. It identifies the most costly happenings in a complex environment where people and machines work as a system. Its origin in investigating [[pilot error]]s in wartime,&lt;ref name="Flanagan54"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;328 et seq&lt;/sup&gt; and other life-and-death situations, means it identifies top priorities in a man-machine system or other complex action-oriented situation. These priorities then feed into procedures for selection and training, and also (continuing the pilot example) into cockpit instrument design.&lt;ref&gt;Fitts P.M. &amp; Jones R.E 1947. ''Psychological aspects of instrument display: I. Analysis of 270 "pilot-error" experiences in reading and interpreting aircraft instruments''. U.S. Air Forces Materiel Command, Report No. TSEAA-694-12A.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chapanis, Alphonse 1959. ''Research techniques in human engineering''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, Chapter 3, Methods for the study of accidents and near-accidents.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[healthcare]], CIT is used in situations where direct examination of clinical staff and researchers can help them better understand their roles and help them solve practical problems. CIT allows clinical staff to better understand their roles in the clinical setting. Another advantage is that it helps them gain better knowledge about their interactions with patients and other clinicians. It also helps clinical staff better understand their practice from a variety of roles (e.g., [[physician]], [[nurse]], clinical educator, nurse informatician, faculty member). In healthcare research, CIT can be a good resource in identifying the experiences of a patient in the healthcare setting, exploring the dimensions of patient–provider interactions and determining patient responses to illnesses and treatments.

CIT is also widely used in [[organizational development]] as a research technique for identification of organizational problems and is suitable for knowledge management in project-based organizations&lt;ref&gt;Haussner et al (2018). [https://ascelibrary.org/doi/full/10.1061/%28ASCE%29ME.1943-5479.0000626 "Exploring Internationally Operated Construction Projects through the Critical Incident Technique"]. ''Journal of Management in Engineering'' 34(5).&lt;/ref&gt;. CIT is used as an interview technique, where the informants are encouraged to talk about unusual organizational incidents instead of answering direct questions. Using CIT deemphasizes the inclusion of general opinions about management and working procedures, instead focusing on specific incidents. 

In [[market research]], CIT has been used more frequently in the last ten years. Although the CIT method first appeared in the marketing literature thirty years ago, the major catalyst for use of the CIT method in service research appears to have been a ''Journal of Marketing'' study conducted by Bitner, Booms, and Tetreault (1990) that investigated sources of satisfaction and dissatisfaction in service encounters. Since the Bitner et al. article, nearly 200 CIT studies have appeared in marketing-related literature.&lt;ref&gt;Gremler's article in ''Journal of Service Research'', Vol. 7, No. 1, August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

CIT has also been used in studies of information-seeking behavior.&lt;ref&gt;"How senior managers acquire and use information in environmental scanning" by Ethel Auster and Chun Wei Choo (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Information sources used by lawyers in problem-solving: An empirical exploration" by Margaret Ann Wilkinson (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"When Is 'Enough' Enough? Modeling the Information-Seeking and Stopping Behavior of Senior Arts Administrators" by Lisl Zach (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

The employment of CIT may also allow construction of typical scenarios of user behavior when they interact with various technologies including information systems. For this, researchers should solicit:

# the cause, description and outcome of a critical incident;
# users' feelings and perceptions of the situation;
# actions taken during the incident;
# changes (if any) in their future behavior.

The typical scenarios may be presented visually as a diagram or a [[causal model]].&lt;ref&gt;Serenko, A. (2006). [http://www.aserenko.com/papers/Serenko_CIT_Agents.pdf "The use of interface agents for email notification in critical incidents"]. ''International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'' 64(11): 1084–1098.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
By identifying possible problems associated with major user–system or product complications, CIT recommendations try to ensure that the same type of situations do not result in a similar loss. There are both advantages and disadvantages to using this method, as shown below.{{fact|date=October 2014}} Overall, however, CIT has been demonstrated to be a sound method since first presented in 1954.{{fact|date=October 2014}} Relatively few modifications have been suggested to the method in the more than 50 years since it was introduced, and only minor changes have been made to Flanagan's original approach, indicating reasonable robustness.

===Advantages===
* Flexible method that can be used to improve multi-user systems.
* Data is collected from the respondent's perspective and in his or her own words.
* Does not force the respondents into any given framework.
* Identifies even rare events that might be missed by other methods which only focus on common and everyday events.
* Useful when problems occur but the cause and severity are not known.
* Inexpensive and provides rich information.
* Emphasizes the features that will make a system particularly vulnerable and can bring major benefits (e.g. safety).
* Can be applied using questionnaires or interviews.
* Easy to understand.

===Disadvantages===
* A first problem comes from the type of the reported incidents. The Critical Incident Technique will rely on events being remembered by users and will also require the accurate and truthful reporting of them. Since critical incidents often rely on [[memory]], incidents may be imprecise or may even go unreported.
* The method has a built-in bias towards incidents that happened recently, since these are easier to recall.
* Respondents may not be accustomed to or willing to take the time to tell (or write) a complete story when describing a critical incident.
* Since this method is based on incidents it does not say anything about the everyday situation so it is not very representative.

The '''Cyrus Cylinder''' ({{lang-fa|استوانه کوروش|Ostovane-ye Kūrosh}}) or '''Cyrus Charter''' ({{lang|fa|منشور  کوروش}} ''{{transl|fa|Manshūre Kūrosh}}'') is an ancient clay cylinder, now broken into several pieces, on which is written a declaration in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[cuneiform script]] in the name of [[Persia]]'s [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] king [[Cyrus the Great]].&lt;ref name="Dandamayev-Cylinder" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-2007a"&gt;[[#Kuhrt-2007a|Kuhrt (2007)]], p. 70, 72&lt;/ref&gt; It dates from the 6th century BC and was discovered in the ruins of [[Babylon]] in [[Mesopotamia]] (modern [[Iraq]]) in 1879.&lt;ref name="Dandamayev-Cylinder"&gt;[[#Dandamayev-Cylinder|Dandamayev, (2010-01-26)]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently in the possession of the [[British Museum]], which sponsored the expedition that discovered the cylinder. It was created and used as a [[foundation deposit]] following the [[Babylon#Persian conquest|Persian conquest]] of [[Babylon]] in 539 BC, when the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] was invaded by Cyrus and incorporated into his [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]].

The text on the Cylinder praises Cyrus, sets out his genealogy and portrays him as a king from a line of kings. The Babylonian king [[Nabonidus]], who was defeated and deposed by Cyrus, is denounced as an impious oppressor of the people of Babylonia and his low-born origins are implicitly contrasted to Cyrus' kingly heritage. The victorious Cyrus is portrayed as having been chosen by the chief Babylonian god [[Marduk]] to restore peace and order to the Babylonians. The text states that Cyrus was welcomed by the people of Babylon as their new ruler and entered the city in peace. It appeals to Marduk to protect and help Cyrus and his son [[Cambyses]]. It extols Cyrus as a benefactor of the citizens of Babylonia who improved their lives, repatriated displaced people and restored temples and cult sanctuaries across [[Mesopotamia]] and elsewhere in the region. It concludes with a description of how Cyrus repaired the city wall of Babylon and found a similar inscription placed there by an earlier king.&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-2007a" /&gt;

The Cylinder's text has traditionally been seen by biblical scholars as corroborative evidence of Cyrus' policy of the [[The Return to Zion|repatriation]] of the [[Jews|Jewish people]] following their [[Babylonian captivity]]&lt;ref name="BM-CC" /&gt; (an act that the [[Book of Ezra]] attributes to Cyrus&lt;ref name="Free"&gt;[[#Free|Free &amp; Vos (1992)]], p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;), as the text refers to the restoration of cult sanctuaries and repatriation of deported peoples.&lt;ref name="Becking" /&gt; This interpretation has been disputed, as the text identifies only Mesopotamian sanctuaries, and makes no mention of Jews, Jerusalem, or Judea.&lt;ref name="Janzen" /&gt; The Cylinder has also been referred to by [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], the last [[Shah]] of [[Iran]] as the first declaration of universal [[human rights]], a view rejected by some historians as anachronistic and a misunderstanding of the Cylinder's generic nature as a typical statement made by a new monarch at the beginning of his reign.&lt;ref name="Daniel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/news_and_press/press_releases/2012/cyrus_cylinder_travels_to_us.aspx |title=The Cyrus Cylinder travels to the US |publisher=British Museum |year=2012 |accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/10/cyrus-cylinder-returns-iran |title=Cyrus cylinder, world's oldest human rights charter, returns to Iran on loan |author=Associated Press |publisher=The Guardian |date=10 September 2010 |accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kqed.org/arts/visualarts/article.jsp?essid=124632 |title=Oldest Known Charter of Human Rights Comes to San Francisco |date=13 August 2013 |accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil MacGregor]], former Director of the British Museum, has stated that the cylinder was "the first attempt we know about running a society, a state with different nationalities and faiths—a new kind of statecraft".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/fa/contents/articles/opinion/2013/03/cyrus-cylinder-iran-religious-freedom-minority-rights.html |title=Cyrus Cylinder a Reminder of Persian Legacy of Tolerance |author=Barbara Slavin |publisher=Al-Monitor |date=6 March 2013 |accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adopted as a [[national symbol]] of Iran by the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Imperial State]] which put it on display in [[Tehran]] in 1971 to commemorate [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire]].&lt;ref name="Ansari" /&gt; On October 14, the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Mohammad Reza Shah's]] sister, [[Princess Ashraf Pahlavi]], presented the [[United Nations Secretary General]] [[U Thant]] with a replica of the Cylinder.

The Cyrus Cylinder was discovered during Rassam's excavations in Babylon in February–March 1879.]]
The [[Assyrian people|Assyro]]-[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] archaeologist [[Hormuzd Rassam]] discovered the Cyrus Cylinder in March 1879 during a lengthy programme of excavations in Mesopotamia carried out for the British Museum.&lt;ref name="Finkel"&gt;[[#Finkel|Finkel (2009)]], p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; It had been placed as a [[foundation deposit]] in the foundations of the [[Esagila|Ésagila]], the city's main temple.&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-2007a" /&gt; Rassam's expedition followed on from an earlier dig carried out in 1850 by the British archaeologist [[Austen Henry Layard]], who excavated three mounds in the same area but found little of importance.&lt;ref name="Vos" /&gt; In 1877, Layard became Britain's ambassador to the [[Ottoman Empire]], which ruled Mesopotamia at the time. He helped Rassam, who had been his assistant in the 1850 dig, to obtain a ''[[Firman (decree)|firman]]'' (decree) from the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman Sultan]] [[Abdul Hamid II]] to continue the earlier excavations. The ''firman'' was only valid for a year but a second ''firman'', with much more liberal terms, was issued in 1878. It was granted for two years (through to 15 October 1880) with the promise of an extension to 1882 if required.&lt;ref name="Hilprecht"&gt;[[#Hilprecht|Hilprecht (1903)]], pp. 204–05&lt;/ref&gt; The Sultan's decree authorised Rassam to "pack and dispatch to England any antiquities [he] found … provided, however, there were no duplicates". A representative of the Sultan was instructed to be present at the dig to examine the objects as they were uncovered.&lt;ref name="Rassam"&gt;[[#Rassam|Rassam (1897)]], p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

With permission secured, Rassam initiated a large-scale excavation at Babylon and other sites on behalf of the Trustees of the British Museum.&lt;ref name="Vos" /&gt; He undertook the excavations in four distinct phases. In between each phase, he returned to England to bring back his finds and raise more funds for further work. The Cyrus Cylinder was found on the second of his four expeditions to Mesopotamia, which began with his departure from London on 8 October 1878. He arrived in his home town of [[Mosul]] on 16 November and travelled down the [[Tigris]] to [[Baghdad]], which he reached on 30 January 1879. During February and March, he supervised excavations on a number of Babylonian sites, including Babylon itself.&lt;ref name="Hilprecht" /&gt;

He soon uncovered a number of important buildings including the Ésagila temple. This was a major shrine to the chief Babylonian god Marduk, although its identity was not fully confirmed until the German archaeologist [[Robert Koldewey]]'s excavation of 1900.&lt;ref name="Koldewey"&gt;[[#Koldewey|Koldewey]], p. vi&lt;/ref&gt; The excavators found a large number of business documents written on clay tablets buried in the temple's foundations where they discovered the Cyrus Cylinder.&lt;ref name="Vos"&gt;[[#Vos|Vos (1995)]], p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Rassam gave conflicting accounts of where his discoveries were made. He wrote in his memoirs, ''Asshur and the land of Nimrod'', that the Cylinder had been found in a mound at the southern end of Babylon near the village of Jumjuma or Jimjima.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rassam|Rassam]], p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hilprecht|Hilprecht (1903)]], p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a letter sent on 20 November 1879 to [[Samuel Birch]], the Keeper of Oriental Antiquities at the British Museum, he wrote, "The Cylinder of Cyrus was found at Omran [Tell Amran-ibn-Ali] with about six hundred pieces of inscribed terracottas before I left Baghdad."&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;[[#Walker|Walker]], pp. 158–159&lt;/ref&gt; He left Baghdad on 2 April, returning to Mosul and departing from there on 2 May for a journey to London which lasted until 19 June.&lt;ref name="Hilprecht" /&gt;

The discovery was announced to the public by [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Rawlinson]], the President of the [[Royal Asiatic Society]], at a meeting of the Society on 17 November 1879.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Royal Asiatic Society|''The Times'' (18 November 1879)]]&lt;/ref&gt; He described it as "one of the most interesting historical records in the cuneiform character that has yet been brought to light," though he erroneously described it as coming from the ancient city of [[Borsippa]] rather than Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Monument|''The Oriental Journal'' (January 1880)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Rawlinson's "Notes on a newly-discovered Clay Cylinder of Cyrus the Great" were published in the society's journal the following year, including the first partial translation of the text.&lt;ref name="Rawlinson"&gt;[[#Rawlinson|Rawlinson (1880)]], pp. 70–97&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The Cyrus Cylinder is a barrel-shaped cylinder of baked clay measuring {{convert|22.5|cm|in}} by {{convert|10|cm|in}} at its maximum diameter.&lt;ref name="BM-database"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=327188&amp;partid=1|title=The Cyrus Cylinder (British Museum database)|accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created in several stages around a cone-shaped core of clay within which there are large grey stone inclusions. It was built up with extra layers of clay to give it a cylindrical shape before a fine surface slip of clay was added to the outer layer, on which the text is inscribed. It was excavated in several fragments, having apparently broken apart in antiquity.&lt;ref name="BM-database" /&gt; Today it exists in two main fragments, known as "A" and "B", which were reunited in 1972.&lt;ref name="BM-database" /&gt;

The main body of the Cylinder, discovered by Rassam in 1879, is fragment "A". It underwent restoration in 1961, when it was re-fired and plaster filling was added.&lt;ref name="BM-database" /&gt; The smaller fragment, "B", is a section measuring {{convert|8.6|cm|in}} by {{convert|5.6|cm|in}}. The latter fragment was acquired by J.B. Nies&lt;ref name="Walker" /&gt; of [[Yale University]] from an antiquities dealer.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Curtis|Curtis, Tallis &amp; André-Salvini]], p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Nies published the text in 1920.&lt;ref name="Nies"&gt;[[#Nies|Nies &amp; Keiser (1920)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The fragment was apparently broken off the main body of the Cylinder during the original excavations in 1879 and was either removed from the excavations or was retrieved from one of Rassam's waste dumps. It was not confirmed as part of the Cylinder until Paul-Richard Berger of the [[University of Münster]] definitively identified it in 1970.&lt;ref name="Berger"&gt;[[#Berger|Berger]], pp. 155–159&lt;/ref&gt; Yale University lent the fragment to the British Museum temporarily (but, in practice, indefinitely) in exchange for "a suitable cuneiform tablet" from the British Museum collection.&lt;ref name="BM-database" /&gt;

Although the Cylinder clearly post-dates Cyrus the Great's conquest of Babylon in 539 BC, the date of its creation is unclear. It is commonly said to date to the early part of Cyrus's reign over Babylon, some time after 539 BC. The British Museum puts the Cylinder's date of origin at between 539–530 BC.&lt;ref name="BM-CC" /&gt;

=== Text ===
{{Wikisource|Cyrus cylinder}}
The surviving inscription on the Cyrus Cylinder consists of 45 lines of text written in Akkadian cuneiform script. The first 35 lines are on fragment "A" and the remainder are on fragment "B".&lt;ref name="Berger" /&gt; A number of lines at the start and end of the text are too badly damaged for more than a few words to be legible.

The text is written in an extremely formulaic style that can be divided into six distinct parts:

[[File:Cyrus Cylinder detail.jpg|thumb|alt=Detail image of text|Sample detail image showing cuneiform script.]]
The beginning of the text is partly broken; the surviving content reprimands the character of the deposed Babylonian king [[Nabonidus]]. It lists his alleged crimes, charging him with the desecration of the temples of the gods and the imposition of [[corvee|forced labor]] upon the populace. According to the proclamation, as a result of these offenses, the god Marduk abandoned Babylon and sought a more righteous king. Marduk called forth Cyrus to enter Babylon and become its new ruler.&lt;ref name="Finkel-Translation" /&gt;

{{quote|In [Nabonidus's] mind, reverential fear of Marduk, king of the gods, came to an end. He did yet more evil to his city every day; … his [people ................…], he brought ruin on them all by a yoke without relief … [Marduk] inspected and checked all the countries, seeking for the upright king of his choice. He took the hand of Cyrus, king of the city of [[Anshan (Persia)|Anshan]], and called him by his name, proclaiming him aloud for the kingship over all of everything.&lt;ref name="Finkel-Translation" /&gt;}}

Midway through the text, the writer switches to a [[first-person narrative]] in the voice of Cyrus, addressing the reader directly. A list of his titles is given (in a Mesopotamian rather than Persian style): "I am Cyrus, king of the world, great king, powerful king, king of Babylon, king of [[Sumer]] and [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], king of the four quarters [of the earth], son of [[Cambyses of Anshan|Cambyses]], great king, king of Anshan, descendent of [[Teispes of Anshan|Teispes]], great king, king of Anshan, the perpetual seed of kingship, whose reign [[Bel (mythology)|Bel]] [Marduk] and [[Nabu|Nebo]] love, and with whose kingship, to their joy, they concern themselves."&lt;ref name="Finkel-Translation"&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=327188&amp;partId=1 Translation of the text on the Cyrus Cylinder]. Finkel, Irving.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes the pious deeds he performed after his conquest: he restored peace to Babylon and the other cities sacred to Marduk, freeing their inhabitants from their "yoke," and he "brought relief to their dilapidated housing (thus) putting an end to their (main) complaints".&lt;ref name="Pritchard"&gt;[[#Pritchard|Pritchard]]&lt;/ref&gt; He repaired the ruined temples in the cities he conquered, restored their cults, and returned their sacred images as well as their former inhabitants which Nabonidus had taken to Babylon.&lt;ref name="Pritchard" /&gt; Near the end of the inscription Cyrus highlights his restoration of Babylon's city wall, saying: "I saw within it an inscription of [[Ashurbanipal]], a king who preceded me."&lt;ref name="Finkel-Translation" /&gt; The remainder is missing but presumably describes Cyrus's rededication of the gateway mentioned.&lt;ref name="Kutsko"&gt;[[#Kutsko|Kutsko]], p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

A partial transcription by F. H. Weissbach in 1911 was supplanted by a much more complete transcription after the identification of the "B" fragment;&lt;ref name="Weissbach"&gt;[[#Weissbach|Weissbach]], p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; this is now available in German and in English.&lt;ref name="Schaudig"&gt;[[#Schaudig|Schaudig]], pp. 550–556&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pritchard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hallo"&gt;[[#Hallo|Hallo]], p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[#Editions and translations|editions of the full text]] of the Cyrus Cylinder are available online, incorporating both "A" and "B" fragments.

A false translation of the text – affirming, among other things, the abolition of slavery and the right to self-determination, a minimum wage and asylum – has been promoted on the Internet and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Schulz"&gt;[[#Schulz|Schulz (2008-07-15)]]&lt;/ref&gt; As well as making claims that are not found on the real cylinder, it refers to the [[Zoroastrian]] divinity [[Ahura Mazda]] rather than the Mesopotamian god Marduk.&lt;ref&gt;compare {{cite web |url=http://www.niasnet.org/iran-history/artifacts-historical-places-of-iran/cyruscylinder/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615163639/http://www.niasnet.org/iran-history/artifacts-historical-places-of-iran/cyruscylinder/ |archivedate=2013-06-15 |df= }} with the British Museum translation at [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/articles/c/cyrus_cylinder_-_translation.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; The false translation has been widely circulated; alluding to its claim that Cyrus supposedly has stated that "Every country shall decide for itself whether or not it wants my leadership."&lt;ref name="Schulz" /&gt; Iranian [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Shirin Ebadi]] in her acceptance speech described Cyrus as "the very emperor who proclaimed at the pinnacle of power 2,500 years ago that … he would not reign over the people if they did not wish it".&lt;ref name="Schulz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Foucart"&gt;[[#Foucart|Foucart (2007-08-19)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref=2003-Noble-Peace-Prize-lecture|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2003/ebadi-lecture-e.html|title=Shirin Ebadi's 2003 Nobel Peace Prize lecture|publisher=Nobel Foundation|accessdate=2011-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Associated fragments ===
The British Museum announced in January 2010 that two inscribed clay fragments, which had been in the Museum's collection since 1881, had been identified as part of a cuneiform tablet that was inscribed with the same text as the Cyrus Cylinder. The fragments had come from the small site of Dailem near Babylon and the identification was made by Professor [[Wilfred Lambert]], formerly of the University of Birmingham, and [[Irving Finkel]], curator in charge of the Museum's Department of the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Irving Finkel|author=British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/staff/middle_east/irving_finkel.aspx|accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/news_and_press_releases/statements/cyrus_cylinder.aspx Cyrus Cylinder (press release)]. British Museum, 20 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relation to a Chinese bone inscription ===
In 1983 two fossilized horse bones inscribed with cuneiform signs surfaced in China which Professor [[Oliver Gurney]] at Oxford later identified as coming from the Cyrus Cylinder. The discovery of these objects aroused much discussion about possible connections between ancient Mesopotamia and China, although their authenticity was doubted by many scholars from the beginning and they are now generally regarded as forgeries. 

The history of the putative artifact goes back almost a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Zhi|date=1987|title=Brief Note on the Bone Cuneiform Inscriptions|url=|journal=[[Journal of Ancient Civilizations]]|volume=2|pages=30–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest record goes back to a Chinese doctor named Xue Shenwei, who sometime prior to 1928 was shown a photo of a rubbing of one of the bones by an antiquities dealer named Zhang Yi'an.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cyrus Cylinder: The King of Persia's Proclamation from Ancient Babylon|last=|first=|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2013|isbn=978-1780760636|editor-last=Finkel|editor-first=Irving|location=|pages=28–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not able to view the bones at that time, Xue Shenwei later acquired one of them from another antiquities dealer named Wang Dongting in 1935 and then the second via a personal connection named Ke Yanling around 1940. While Xue did not recognize the script on the bones he guessed at its antiquity and buried the bones for safekeeping during the Cultural Revolution. Then, in 1983 Xue presented the bones to the Palace Museum in Beijing where Liu Jiuan and Wang Nanfang of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage undertook their study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These officials identified the script as cuneiform and asked the Assyriologists Chi Yang and [[Institute for the History of Ancient Civilizations|Wu Yuhong]] to work on the inscriptions. Identification of the source text proceeded slowly until 1985, when Wu Yuhong along with Oxford Assyriologist [[Stephanie Dalley]] and Oliver Gurney recognized the text in one bone as coming from the Cyrus Cylinder. One year later Wu Yuhong presented his findings at the 33rd Rencontre Assyriologique and published them in a journal article.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Yuhong|date=1986|title=A Horse-Bone Inscription copied from the Cyrus Cylinder (Line 18-21) in the Palace Museum in Beijing|trans-title=|url=|journal=Journal of Ancient Civilizations|volume=1|pages=15–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After that the second bone inscription remained undeciphered until 2010, when Irving Finkel worked on it. In that same year the British Museum held a conference dedicated to the artifacts. Based on the serious textual errors in the inscription, including the omission of a large number of signs from the Cyrus Cylinder, Wu Yuhong argued the inscriptions were most likely copied from the cylinder while housed in the British Museum or from an early modern publication based upon it. However he acknowledged the remote possibility it was copied in late antiquity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Irving Finkel disputed this conclusion based on the relative obscurity of the Cyrus Cylinder until recent decades and the mismatch in paleography between the bone inscriptions and the hand copies found in early editions from the 1880's. 

Finally, after the workshop concluded, an 1884 edition of the Cyrus Cylinder by [[E. A. Wallis Budge]] came to Irving Finkel's attention. This publication used an idiosyncratic typeface and featured a handcopy for only a section of the whole cylinder. However the typeface in that edition matched the paleography on the bone inscriptions and the extract of the cylinder published in the book matched that of the bone as well. This convinced Finkel that the bone inscriptions were early modern forgeries and that has remained the majority opinion since then.

== Interpretations ==

=== Mesopotamian and Persian tradition and propaganda ===
According to the British Museum, the Cyrus Cylinder reflects a long tradition in Mesopotamia where, from as early as the third millennium BC, kings began their reigns with declarations of reforms.&lt;ref name="BM-CC"&gt;British Museum: [[#BM-The Cyrus Cylinder|The Cyrus Cylinder]]&lt;/ref&gt; Cyrus's declaration stresses his legitimacy as the king, and is a conspicuous statement of his respect for the religious and political traditions of Babylon. The British Museum and scholars of the period describe it as an instrument of ancient Mesopotamian propaganda.&lt;ref name="BM-inscription"&gt;[[#BM-inscription|Inscription in the British Museum, Room 55]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-1982"&gt;[[#Kuhrt-1982|Kuhrt (1982)]], p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

The text is a royal building inscription, a genre which had no equivalent in [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] literature. It illustrates how Cyrus co-opted local traditions and symbols to legitimize his conquest and control of Babylon.&lt;ref name="Kutsko" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Winn"&gt;[[#Winn Leith|Winn Leith]], p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Many elements of the text were drawn from long-standing Mesopotamian themes of legitimizing rule in Babylonia: the preceding king is reprimanded and he is proclaimed to have been abandoned by the gods for his wickedness; the new king has gained power through the divine will of the gods; the new king rights the wrongs of his predecessor, addressing the welfare of the people; the sanctuaries of the gods are rebuilt or restored, offerings to the gods are made or increased and the blessings of the gods are sought; and repairs are made to the whole city, in the manner of earlier rightful kings.&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-2007a" /&gt;

Both continuity and discontinuity are emphasized in the text of the Cylinder. It asserts the virtue of Cyrus as a gods-fearing king of a traditional Mesopotamian type. On the other hand, it constantly discredits Nabonidus, reviling the deposed king's deeds and even his ancestry and portraying him as an impious destroyer of his own people. As Fowler and Hekster note, this "creates a problem for a monarch who chooses to buttress his claim to legitimacy by appropriating the 'symbolic capital' of his predecessors".&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;[[#Fowler|Fowler &amp; Hekster]], p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The Cylinder's reprimand of Nabonidus also discredits Babylonian royal authority by association. It is perhaps for this reason that the Achaemenid rulers made greater use of Assyrian rather than Babylonian royal iconography and tradition in their declarations; the Cylinder refers to the Assyrian king [[Ashurbanipal]] as "my predecessor", rather than any native Babylonian ruler.&lt;ref name="Fowler" /&gt;

The Cylinder itself is part of a continuous Mesopotamian tradition of depositing a wide variety of symbolic items, including animal sacrifices, stone tablets, terracotta cones, cylinders and figures. Newly crowned kings of Babylon would make public declarations of their own righteousness when beginning their reigns, often in the form of declarations that were deposited in the foundations of public buildings.&lt;ref&gt;British Museum: [[#BM-The Cyrus Cylinder|The Cyrus Cylinder]]; [[#Kuhrt-1983|Kuhrt (1983)]], pp. 83–97; [[#Dandamaev|Dandamaev]], pp. 52–53; [[#Beaulieu|Beaulieu]], p. 243; [[#van der Spek|van der Spek]], pp. 273–285; [[#Wiesehöfer-2001|Wiesehöfer (2001)]], p. 82; [[#Briant|Briant]], p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Some contained messages, while others did not, and they had a number of purposes: elaboration of a building's value, commemoration of the ruler or builder and the magical sanctification of the building, through the invocation of divine protection.

The cylinder was not intended to be seen again after its burial, but the text inscribed on it would have been used for public purposes. Archive copies were kept of important inscriptions and the Cylinder's text may likewise have been copied.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Haubold|Haubold]], p. 52 fn. 24&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010, the British Museum announced that two cuneiform tablets in its collection had been found to be inscribed with the same text as that on the Cyrus Cylinder,&lt;ref name="BM-discovery-2010-01-11"&gt;[[#BM-discovery-2010-01-11|British Museum e-mail (2010-01-11)]]&lt;/ref&gt; which, according to the Museum, "show that the text of the Cylinder was probably a proclamation that was widely distributed across the Persian Empire".&lt;ref name="BM-Statements"&gt;[[#BM-Statements regarding|British Museum statement (2010-01-20)]]&lt;/ref&gt;
A statue of the cylinder is now on exhibit in Los Angeles on avenue of the stars as a gift from the Persian people to the city of Los Angeles 
==== Similarities with other royal inscriptions ====
[[File:Nabonidus cylinder sippar bm1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Nabonidus Cylinder]]]]

The Cyrus Cylinder bears striking similarities to older Mesopotamian royal inscriptions. Two notable examples are the Cylinder of [[Marduk-apla-iddina II]], who seized the Babylonian throne in 722/1 BC, and the annals of [[Sargon II]] of Assyria, who conquered Babylon twelve years later. As a conqueror, Marduk-apla-iddina faced many of the same problems of legitimacy that Cyrus did when he conquered Babylon. He declares himself to have been chosen personally by Marduk, who ensured his victory. When he took power, he performed the sacred rites and restored the sacred shrines. He states that he found a royal inscription placed in the temple foundations by an earlier Babylonian king, which he left undisturbed and honored. All of these claims also appear in Cyrus's Cylinder. Twelve years later, the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]] defeated and exiled Marduk-apla-iddina, taking up the kingship of Babylonia. Sargon's annals describe how he took on the duties of a Babylonian sovereign, honouring the gods, maintaining their temples and respecting and upholding the privileges of the urban elite. Again, Cyrus's Cylinder makes exactly the same points. Nabonidus, Cyrus's deposed predecessor as king of Babylon, commissioned foundation texts on clay cylinders – such as the [[Cylinder of Nabonidus]], also in the British Museum – that follows the same basic formula.&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-2007b"&gt;[[#Kuhrt-2007b|Kuhrt (2007)]], pp. 174–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

The text of the Cylinder thus indicates a strong continuity with centuries of Babylonian tradition, as part of an established rhetoric advanced by conquerors.&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-2007b" /&gt; As Kuhrt puts it:

{{quote|[The Cylinder] reflects the pressure that Babylonian citizens were able to bring to bear on the new royal claimant … In this context, the reign of the defeated predecessor was automatically described as bad and against the divine will – how else could he have been defeated? By implication, of course, all his acts became, inevitably and retrospectively, tainted.&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-2007b" /&gt;}}

The familiarity with long-established Babylonian tropes suggests that the Cylinder was authored by the Babylonian priests of Marduk, working at the behest of Cyrus.&lt;ref name="Dyck"&gt;[[#Dyck|Dyck]], pp. 91–94.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be compared with another work of around the same time, the ''Verse Account of Nabonidus'', in which the former Babylonian ruler is excoriated as the enemy of the priests of Marduk and Cyrus is presented as the liberator of Babylon.&lt;ref name="Grabbe"&gt;[[#Grabbe|Grabbe (2004)]], p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Both works make a point of stressing Cyrus's qualifications as a king from a line of kings, in contrast to the non-royal ancestry of Nabonidus, who is described by the Cylinder as merely ''maţû'', "insignificant".&lt;ref name="Dick"&gt;[[#Dick|Dick]], p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Verse Account'' is so similar to the Cyrus Cylinder inscription that the two texts have been dubbed an example of "literary dependence" – not the ''direct'' dependence of one upon the other, but mutual dependence upon a common source. This is characterised by the historian [[Morton Smith]] as "the propaganda put out in Babylonia by Cyrus's agents, shortly before Cyrus's conquest, to prepare the way of their lord".&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; This viewpoint has been disputed; as Simon J. Sherwin of the [[University of Cambridge]] puts it, the Cyrus Cylinder and the ''Verse Account'' are "after the event" compositions which reuse existing Mesopotamian literary themes and do not need to be explained as the product of pre-conquest Persian propaganda.&lt;ref name="Sherwin"&gt;[[#Sherwin|Sherwin]], p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German historian Hanspeter Schaudig has identified a line on the Cylinder ("He [i.e. Marduk] saved his city Babylon from its oppression") with a line from tablet VI of the Babylonian "Epic of Creation", ''[[Enûma Eliš]]'', in which Marduk builds Babylon.&lt;ref name="Haubold"&gt;[[#Haubold|Haubold]], p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Johannes Haubold suggests that reference represents Cyrus's takeover as a moment of ultimate restoration not just of political and religious institutions, but of the cosmic order underpinning the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Haubold|Haubold]], p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Analysis of the Cylinder's claims ====
[[File:Nabonidus.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Stone stele with a carving depicting a man with a beard, carrying a tall staff and wearing a robe and conical hat, gesturing to three symbols representing the moon, sun and Venus.|[[Stele]] depicting Nabonidus praying to the [[Lunar deity|moon]], sun and the planet Venus. The Babylonian king's religious practices were harshly condemned by the Cyrus Cylinder's inscription.]]

The Cyrus Cylinder's vilification of Nabonidus is consistent with other Persian propaganda regarding the deposed king's rule. In contrast to the Cylinder's depiction of Nabonidus as an illegitimate ruler who ruined his country, the reign of Nabonidus was largely peaceful, he was recognised as a legitimate king and he undertook a variety of building projects and military campaigns commensurate with his claim to be "the king of Babylon, the universe, and the four corners [of the Earth]".&lt;ref name="Bidmead"&gt;[[#Bidmead|Bidmead]], p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assyriologist [[Paul-Alain Beaulieu]] has interpreted Nabonidus's exaltation of the moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]] as "an outright usurpation of Marduk's prerogatives by the moon god".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bidmead|Bidmead]], p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Babylonian king continued to make rich offerings to Marduk, his greater devotion to Sin was unacceptable to the Babylonian priestly elite.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bidmead|Bidmead]], p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Nabonidus came from the unfashionable north of Babylonia, introduced foreign gods and went into a lengthy self-imposed exile which was said to have prevented the celebration of the vital New Year festival.&lt;ref name="Mallowan"&gt;[[#Mallowan|Mallowan]], pp. 409–411&lt;/ref&gt; Cyrus's conquest of Babylonia was resisted by Nabonidus and his supporters, as the [[Battle of Opis]] demonstrated. [[Iranologist]] [[Pierre Briant]] comments that "it is doubtful that even before the fall of [Babylon] Cyrus was impatiently awaited by a population desperate for a 'liberator'."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Briant|Briant]], p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cyrus's takeover as king does appear to have been welcomed by some of the Babylonian population.&lt;ref name="Buchanan"&gt;[[#Buchanan|Buchanan]], pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; The Judaic historian Lisbeth S. Fried says that there is little evidence that the high-ranking priests of Babylonia during the Achaemenid period were Persians and characterises them as Babylonian collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fried|Fried]], p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription goes on to describe Cyrus returning to their original sanctuaries the statues of the gods that Nabonidus had brought to the city before the Persian invasion. This restored the normal cultic order to the satisfaction of the priesthood. It alludes to temples being restored and deported groups being returned to their homelands but does not imply an empire-wide programme of restoration. Instead, it refers to specific areas in the border region between Babylonia and Persia, including sites that had been devastated by earlier Babylonian military campaigns. The Cylinder indicates that Cyrus sought to acquire the loyalty of the ravaged regions by funding reconstruction, the return of temple properties and the repatriation of the displaced populations. However, it is unclear how much actually changed on the ground; there is no archaeological evidence for any rebuilding or repairing of Mesopotamian temples during Cyrus's reign.&lt;ref name="Winn" /&gt;

The text presents Cyrus as entering Babylon peacefully and being welcomed by the population as a liberator. This presents an implicit contrast with previous conquerors, notably the Assyrian rulers [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]], who invaded and plundered Babylon in the 12th century BC, and [[Sennacherib]], who did the same thing 150 years before Cyrus conquered the region.&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt; The massacre and enslavement of conquered people was common practice and was explicitly highlighted by conquerors in victory statements. The Cyrus Cylinder presents a very different message; Johannes Haubold notes that it portrays Cyrus's takeover as a harmonious moment of convergence between Babylonian and Persian history, not a natural disaster but the salvation of Babylonia.&lt;ref name="Haubold" /&gt;

However, the Cylinder's account of Cyrus's conquest clearly does not tell the whole story, as it suppresses any mention of the earlier conflict between the Persians and the Babylonians;&lt;ref name="Haubold" /&gt; [[Max Mallowan]] describes it as a "skilled work of tendentious history".&lt;ref name="Mallowan" /&gt; The text omits the Battle of Opis, in which Cyrus's forces defeated and apparently massacred Nabonidus's army.&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-2007a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheim, A. Leo, in Pritchard, James B. ''Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament''. Princeton University Press, 1950&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Briant|Briant]], p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Nor does it explain a two-week gap reported by the Nabonidus Chronicle between the Persian entry into Babylon and the surrender of the Esagila temple. Lisbeth S. Fried suggests that there may have been a siege or stand-off between the Persians and the temple's defenders and priests, about whose fate the Cylinder and Chronicle makes no mention. She speculates that they were killed or expelled by the Persians and replaced by more pro-Persian members of the Babylonian priestly elite.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fried|Fried]], p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; As Walton and Hill put it, the claim of a wholly peaceful takeover acclaimed by the people is "standard conqueror's rhetoric and may obscure other facts".&lt;ref name="Walton"&gt;[[#Walton|Walton &amp; Hill]], p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the claim of one's own armies being welcomed as liberators as "one of the great imperial fantasies", Bruce Lincoln, Professor of Divinity at the [[University of Chicago]], notes that the Babylonian population repeatedly revolted against Persian rule in 522 BC, 521 BC, 484 BC and 482 BC (though not against Cyrus or his son Cambeses). The rebels sought to restore national independence and the line of native Babylonian kings – perhaps an indication that they were not as favourably disposed towards the Persians as the Cylinder suggests.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lincoln (2007)|Lincoln]], p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The Persians' policy towards their subject people, as described by the Cylinder, was traditionally viewed as an expression of tolerance, moderation and generosity "on a scale previously unknown".&lt;ref name="Masroori"&gt;[[#Masroori|Masroori]], p. 13-15&lt;/ref&gt; The policies of Cyrus toward subjugated nations have been contrasted to those of the Assyrians and Babylonians, who had treated subject peoples harshly; he permitted the resettling of those who had been previously deported and sponsored the reconstruction of religious buildings.&lt;ref name="Dandamaev"&gt;[[#Dandamaev|Dandamaev]], pp. 52–53&lt;/ref&gt; Cyrus was often depicted positively in Western tradition by sources such as the Old Testament of the Bible and the Greek writers [[Herodotus]] and [[Xenophon]].&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;[[#Brown|Brown]], pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arberry"&gt;[[#Arberry|Arberry]], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Cyropaedia]]'' of Xenophon was particularly influential during the [[Renaissance]] when Cyrus was romanticised as an exemplary model of a virtuous and successful ruler.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stillman|Stillman]], p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern historians argue that while Cyrus's behavior was indeed conciliatory, it was driven by the needs of the Persian Empire, and was not an expression of personal tolerance per se.&lt;ref name="Min"&gt;[[#Min|Min]], p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The empire was too large to be centrally directed; Cyrus followed a policy of using existing territorial units to implement a decentralized system of government. The magnanimity shown by Cyrus won him praise and gratitude from those he spared.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;[[#Evans|Evans]], pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; The policy of toleration described by the Cylinder was thus, as biblical historian Rainer Albertz puts it, "an expression of conservative support for local regions to serve the political interests of the whole [empire]".&lt;ref name="Albertz"&gt;[[#Albertz|Albertz]], pp. 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; Another biblical historian, [[Alberto Soggin]], comments that it was more "a matter of practicality and economy … [as] it was simpler, and indeed cost less, to obtain the spontaneous collaboration of their subjects at a local level than to have to impose their sovereignty by force".&lt;ref name="Soggin"&gt;[[#Soggin|Soggin]], p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biblical interpretations ===
{{Main article|Cyrus in the Judeo-Christian tradition}}
{{details|The Return to Zion}}
[[File:Cyrus cylinder Mesopotamia.svg|right|thumb|350px|alt=Map showing various places in Mesopotamia mentioned by the Cyrus Cylinder.|Places in Mesopotamia mentioned by the Cyrus Cylinder. Most of the localities it mentions in connection with the restoration of temples were in eastern and northern Mesopotamia, in territories that had been ruled by the deposed Babylonian king Nabonidus (excepting Susa).]]
The Bible records that some Jews (who were exiled by the Babylonians), returned to their homeland from Babylon, where they had been settled by [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]], to rebuild the temple following an edict from Cyrus. The [[Book of Ezra]] (1–4:5) provides a narrative account of the rebuilding project.&lt;ref name="Hurowitz"&gt;[[#Hurowitz|Hurowitz]], pp. 581–591&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have linked one particular passage from the Cylinder to the Old Testament account:&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-1982" /&gt;

{{quote|From [?]&lt;ref&gt;Older translations used to give "Nineveh." The relevant passage is fragmentary, but I. Finkel has recently concluded that it is impossible to interpret it as "Nineveh". (I. Finkel, "No Nineveh in the Cyrus Cylinder", in ''NABU'' 1997/23 [http://www.achemenet.com])&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Ashur|Aššur]] and [from] [[Susa]], [[Agade]], [[Eshnunna|Ešnunna]], Zabban, Me-Turnu, [[Der (Sumer)|Der]], as far as the region of [[Gutian people#Gutium as a later geographic term|Gutium]], the sacred centers on the other side of the [[Tigris]], whose sanctuaries had been abandoned for a long time, I returned the images of the gods, who had resided there [i.e., in Babylon], to their places and I let them dwell in eternal abodes. I gathered all their inhabitants and returned to them their dwellings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/cyrus_I/cyrus_cylinder2.html Cyrus Cylinder] translation, adapted from Schaudig 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This passage has often been interpreted as a reference to the benign policy instituted by Cyrus of allowing exiled peoples, such as the Jews, to return to their original homelands.&lt;ref name="Becking"&gt;[[#Becking|Becking]], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The Cylinder's inscription has been linked with the reproduction in the Book of Ezra of two texts that are claimed to be edicts issued by Cyrus concerning the repatriation of the Jews and the reconstruction of the Temple in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dandamayev-Iranica|Dandamaev (2010-01-26)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The two edicts (one in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and one in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]) are substantially different in content and tone, leading some historians to argue that one or both may be a ''post hoc'' fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bedford|Bedford]], p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; The question of their authenticity remains unresolved, though it is widely believed that they do reflect some sort of Persian royal policy, albeit perhaps not one that was couched in the terms given in the text of the biblical edicts.

The dispute over the authenticity of the biblical edicts has prompted interest in this passage from the Cyrus Cylinder, specifically concerning the question of whether it indicates that Cyrus had a ''general'' policy of repatriating subject peoples and restoring their sanctuaries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bedford|Bedford]], p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; The text of the Cylinder is very specific, listing places in Mesopotamia and the neighboring regions. It does not describe any general release or return of exiled communities but focuses on the return of Babylonian deities to their own home cities. It emphasises the re-establishment of local religious norms, reversing the alleged neglect of Nabonidus – a theme that Amélie Kuhrt describes as "a literary device used to underline the piety of Cyrus as opposed to the blasphemy of Nabonidus". She suggests that Cyrus had simply adopted a policy used by earlier Assyrian rulers of giving privileges to cities in key strategic or politically sensitive regions and that there was no general policy as such.&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-1983"&gt;[[#Kuhrt-1983|Kuhrt (1983)]], pp. 83–97&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lester L. Grabbe]], a historian of early Judaism, has written that "the religious policy of the Persians was not that different from the basic practice of the Assyrians and Babylonians before them" in tolerating – but not promoting – local cults, other than their own gods.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Grabbe-2006|Grabbe (2006)]], p. 542&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyrus may have seen [[Jerusalem]], situated in a strategic location between Mesopotamia and Egypt, as worth patronising for political reasons. His Achaemenid successors generally supported indigenous cults in subject territories as an expression of their legitimacy as rulers, thereby currying favour with the cults' devotees.&lt;ref name="Bedford138"&gt;[[#Bedford|Bedford]], pp. 138–139&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the Persian kings could, and did, destroy the shrines of peoples who had rebelled against them, as happened at [[Miletos]] in 494 BC following the [[Ionian Revolt]].&lt;ref&gt;Greaves, Alan M. ''Miletos: A History'', p. 84. Routledge, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-415-23846-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Ernst Badian has noted regarding the Ionian revolt "[that] Harpagus 'devastated' all of lower Asia (1.177) is obviously an exaggeration, for the Ionians soon returned to their trading activities." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ionian-revolt|title=IONIAN REVOLT – Encyclopaedia Iranica|first=|last=electricpulp.com|work=iranicaonline.org|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Persians evidently did give permission for its reconstruction, which would have been required given the circumstances of its destruction.&lt;ref name="Bedford138" /&gt; However, the Cylinder's text does not describe any general policy of a return of exiles or mention any sanctuary outside Babylonia;&lt;ref name="Janzen"&gt;[[#Janzen|Janzen]], p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; the biblical historian Bob Becking concludes that "it has nothing to do with Judeans, Jews or Jerusalem."&lt;ref name="Becking" /&gt; Peter Ross Bedford argues that the Cylinder "is thus not a manifesto for a general policy regarding indigenous cults and their worshippers throughout the empire".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bedford|Bedford]], p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Kuhrt comments that "the purely Babylonian context of the Cylinder provides no proof" of the historicity of Cyrus's return of the Jewish exiles and the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem,&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-1982" /&gt; though Becking links this with the lack of any references to the Jews in surviving Achaemenid texts – an indication that the Persians seem not to have regarded them as being of any great importance.&lt;ref name="Becking" /&gt;

The German scholar [[Josef Wiesehöfer]] summarizes the widely held traditional view by noting that "Many scholars have read into […] sentences [from the text of Cylinder] a confirmation of the Old Testament passages about the steps taken by Cyrus towards the erection of the Jerusalem temple and the repatriation of the Judaeans" and this interpretation was, according to Wiesehöfer, for some scholars a strict belief "that the instructions to this effect were actually provided in these very formulations of the Cyrus Cylinder".&lt;ref name="Wiesehöfer-2001" /&gt;

=== Human rights ===
The Cylinder gained new prominence in the late 1960s when the last [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]] called it "the world's first charter of [[human rights]]".&lt;ref name="MacGregor"&gt;[[#MacGregor|MacGregor]]&lt;/ref&gt; The cylinder was a key symbol of the Shah's political ideology and is still regarded by some commentators as a charter of human rights, despite the disagreement of some historians and scholars.&lt;ref name="Ansari" /&gt;

==== Pahlavi Iranian government's view ====
[[File:Emblem2500Persepolis.jpg|thumb|Cyrus Cylinder at the center of the official emblem of [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire]] at Pahlavi Iranian imperial era]]
The Cyrus Cylinder was dubbed the "first declaration of human rights" by the pre-[[Iranian Revolution|Revolution]] Iranian government,&lt;ref name="note"&gt;[http://www.livius.org/a/1/inscriptions/cyrus.pdf United Nations Note to Correspondents no. 3699, 13 October 1971]&lt;/ref&gt; a reading prominently advanced by [[List of kings of Persia|Shah]] [[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi]], in a 1967 book, ''The White Revolution of Iran''. The Shah identified Cyrus as a key figure in government ideology and associated his government with the Achaemenids.&lt;ref name="Wiesehöfer-1999"&gt;[[#Wiesehöfer-1999|Wiesehöfer (1999)]], pp. 55–68&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that "the history of our empire began with the famous declaration of Cyrus, which, for its advocacy of humane principles, justice and liberty, must be considered one of the most remarkable documents in the history of mankind."&lt;ref name="Pahlavi" /&gt; The Shah described Cyrus as the first ruler in history to give his subjects "freedom of opinion and other basic rights".&lt;ref name="Pahlavi"&gt;[[#Pahlavi|Pahlavi]], p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, the Shah opened [[World Conference on Human Rights#Background|the first United Nations Conference on Human Rights]] in [[Tehran]] by saying that the Cyrus Cylinder was the precursor to the modern [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="Robertson"&gt;[[#Robertson|Robertson]], p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1971 [[Nowruz]] (New Year) speech, the Shah declared that 1971 would be Cyrus the Great Year, during which a grand commemoration would be held to celebrate 2,500 years of Persian monarchy. It would serve as a showcase for a modern Iran in which the contributions that Iran had made to world civilization would be recognized. The main theme of the commemoration was the centrality of the monarchy within Iran's political system, associating the Shah of Iran with the famous monarchs of Persia's past, and with Cyrus in particular.&lt;ref name="Ansari"&gt;[[#Ansari|Ansari]], pp. 218–19.&lt;/ref&gt; The Shah looked to the Achaemenid period as "a moment from the national past that could best serve as a model and a slogan for the imperial society he hoped to create".&lt;ref name="Lincoln"&gt;[[#Lincoln|Lincoln]], p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cyrus Cylinder was adopted as the symbol for the commemoration, and Iranian magazines and journals published numerous articles about ancient Persian history.&lt;ref name="Ansari" /&gt; The British Museum loaned the original Cylinder to the Iranian government for the duration of the festivities; it was put on display at the Shahyad Monument (now the [[Azadi Tower]]) in [[Tehran]].&lt;ref name="Housego"&gt;[[#Housego|Housego (1971-10-15)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2,500 year celebration of Iran's monarchy|2,500 year celebrations]] commenced on October 12, 1971 and culminated a week later with a spectacular parade at the tomb of Cyrus in [[Pasargadae]]. On October 14, the shah's sister, [[Princess Ashraf Pahlavi]], presented the [[United Nations Secretary General]] [[U Thant]] with a replica of the Cylinder. The princess asserted that "the heritage of Cyrus was the heritage of human understanding, tolerance, courage, compassion and, above all, human liberty".&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt; The Secretary General accepted the gift, linking the Cylinder with the efforts of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] to address "the question of Respect for Human Rights in Armed Conflict".&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt; Since then the replica Cylinder has been kept at the [[United Nations Headquarters]] in [[New York City]] on the second floor hallway.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;United Nations Press Release 14 October 1971([http://www.livius.org/a/1/inscriptions/cyrus.pdf SG/SM/1553/HQ263])&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations continues to promote the cylinder as "an ancient declaration of human rights".&lt;ref name="Schulz" /&gt;

The interpretation of the Cylinder as a "charter of human rights" has been described by some historians as "rather [[Anachronistic#Scholarship|anachronistic]]" and tendentious.&lt;ref name="Daniel"&gt;[[#Daniel|Daniel]], p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Briant|Briant]], p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#Llewellyn-Jones|Llewellyn-Jones]], p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Curtis"&gt;[[#Curtis|Curtis, Tallis &amp; Andre-Salvini]], p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; It has been dismissed as a "misunderstanding"&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;[[#Mitchell|Mitchell]], p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; and characterized as political propaganda devised by the Pahlavi regime.&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-1983" /&gt; The German historian Josef Wiesehöfer comments that the portrayal of Cyrus as a champion of human rights is as illusory as the image of the "humane and enlightened Shah of Persia".&lt;ref name="Wiesehöfer-1999" /&gt; [[D. Fairchild Ruggles]] and Helaine Silverman describe the Shah's aim as being to legitimise the Iranian nation and his own regime, and to counter the growing influence of Islamic fundamentalism by creating an alternative narrative rooted in the ancient Persian past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Silverman, Helaine|author2=Ruggles, D. Fairchild |author2link=D. Fairchild Ruggles |title=Cultural Heritage and Human Rights|page=11|publisher=Springer|year=2008|isbn=978-0-387-76579-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the immediate aftermath of the Shah's anniversary commemorations, the British Museum's C.B.F. Walker comments that the "essential character of the Cyrus Cylinder [is not] a general declaration of human rights or religious toleration but simply a building inscription, in the Babylonian and Assyrian tradition, commemorating Cyrus's restoration of the city of Babylon and the worship of Marduk previously neglected by Nabonidus".&lt;ref name="Walker" /&gt; Two professors specialising in the history of the ancient Near East, Bill T. Arnold and Piotr Michalowski, comment: "Generically, it belongs with other foundation deposit inscriptions; it is not an edict of any kind, nor does it provide any unusual human rights declaration as is sometimes claimed."&lt;ref name="Arnold"&gt;[[#Arnold|Arnold]], pp. 426–430&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones of the [[University of Edinburgh]] notes that "there is nothing in the text" that suggests the concept of human rights.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Neil MacGregor comments:

== Exhibition history ==
[[File:London 307.JPG|thumb|alt=View of the Cyrus Cylinder in its display cabinet, situated behind glass on a display stand. Other ancient Persian artefacts can be seen lining the room in the background.|The Cyrus Cylinder in Room 55 of the British Museum in London]]
The Cyrus Cylinder has been displayed in the British Museum since its formal acquisition in 1880.&lt;ref name="BM-database" /&gt; It has been loaned four times – twice to Iran, between 7–22 October 1971 in conjunction with the [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire]] and again from September–December 2010, once to [[Spain]] from March–June 2006,&lt;ref name="BM-database" /&gt; and once to the United States in a traveling exhibition from March–October 2013. Many replicas have been made. Some were distributed by the Shah following the 1971 commemorations, while the British Museum and [[National Museum of Iran]] have sold them commercially.&lt;ref name="BM-database" /&gt;

The British Museum's ownership of the Cyrus Cylinder has been the cause of some controversy in Iran, although the artifact was obtained legally and was not excavated on Iranian soil but on former [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman territory]] (modern [[Iraq]]). When it was loaned in 1971, the Iranian press campaigned for its transfer to Iranian ownership. The Cylinder was brought back to London without difficulty, but the British Museum's Board of Trustees subsequently decided that it would be "undesirable to make a further loan of the Cylinder to Iran."&lt;ref name="BM-database" /&gt;

In 2005–2006 the British Museum mounted a major exhibition on the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], ''Forgotten Empire: the World of Ancient Persia.'' It was held in collaboration with the Iranian government, which loaned the British Museum a number of iconic artefacts in exchange for an undertaking that the Cyrus Cylinder would be loaned to the National Museum of Iran in return.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jeffries|Jeffries (2005-10-22)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The planned loan of the Cylinder was postponed in October 2009 following the [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|June 2009 Iranian presidential election]] so that the British Museum could be "assured that the situation in the country was suitable".&lt;ref name=Sheikholeslami&gt;[[#Sheikholeslami|Sheikholeslami (2009-10-12)]]&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Iranian government threatened to end cooperation with the British Museum if the Cylinder was not loaned within the following two months.&lt;ref name=Sheikholeslami /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;[[#Wilson|Wilson (2010-01-24)]]&lt;/ref&gt; This deadline was postponed despite appeals by the Iranian government&lt;ref name=Sheikholeslami /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[[#Iran severs|Iran severs cultural ties with British Museum over Persian treasure (2010-02-07)]]"&lt;/ref&gt; but the Cylinder did eventually go on display in Tehran in September 2010 for a four-month period.&lt;ref name="CyrusCylinderReturns"&gt;[[#CyrusCylinderReturns|''Cyrus Cylinder, world's oldest human rights charter, returns to Iran on loan,'' The Guardian (2010-09-10)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was very popular, attracting 48,000 people within the first ten days and about 500,000 people by the time it closed in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tehrantimes.com/Index_view.asp?code=227412 Cyrus Cylinder warmly welcomed at home]".

On November 28, 2012, the [[BBC]] announced the first United States tour of the Cylinder. Under the headline “British Museum lends ancient 'bill of rights' cylinder to US”, Museum director Neil MacGregor declared that “The cylinder, often referred to as the first bill of human rights, ‘must be shared as widely as possible’".&lt;ref&gt;BBC - "''British Museum lends ancient 'bill of rights' cylinder to US''", 28 November 2012, https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20508195&lt;/ref&gt; The British Museum itself announced the news in its press release, saying "First declaration of human rights’ to tour five cities in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;The British Museum Press Release - "The Cyrus Cylinder travels to the US, ‘First declaration of human rights’ to tour five cities in the United States'", https://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/news_and_press/press_releases/2012/cyrus_cylinder_travels_to_us.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; According to the British Museum's website for the Cylinder's US exhibition "CyrusCylinder2013.com", the tour started in March 2013 and included [[Washington DC]]’s [[Arthur M. Sackler Gallery|Smithsonian's Arthur M. Sackler Gallery]], the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston|Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[Houston]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]], the [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|Asian Art Museum]] in [[San Francisco]] and culminated at the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] in [[Los Angeles]], in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Cyrus Cylinder US Tour 2013, Tour Venues and Dates, http://cyruscylinder2013.com/venues/&lt;/ref&gt;

The cylinder, along with thirty two other associated objects from the [[British Museum]] collection, including a pair of gold armlets from the [[Oxus Treasure]] and the Darius Seal, were part of an exhibition titled 'The Cyrus Cylinder and Ancient Persia – A New Beginning' at the [[Prince of Wales Museum]] in [[Mumbai]], India, from December 21, 2013 to February 25, 2014. It was organised by the British Museum and the Prince of Wales Museum in partnership with [[Sir Dorabji Tata and Allied Trusts|Sir Dorabji Tata Trust]], [[Sir Ratan Tata Trust]] and Navajbai Ratan Tata Trust, all set up by luminaries from the [[Parsi]] community, who are descendants of Persian [[Zoroastrians]], who hold [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] in great regard, as many scholars consider him as a follower of [[Zoroastrianism]].&lt;ref&gt;'The Cyrus Cylinder and Ancient Persia — A New Beginning', an exhibition in partnership with three Tata trusts, http://www.tata.co.in/company/releasesinside/The-Cyrus-Cylinder-and-Ancient-Persia-A-New-Beginning-an-exhibition-in-partnership-with-three-Tata-trusts&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Freedom Sculpture''' ({{lang-fa|تندیس آزادی}}) is a [[gold]] and [[silver]] [[statue]] located on [[Santa Monica Boulevard]] in the [[Beverly Hills, California]].
 
The design of the Freedom Sculpture was created by artist and architect [[Cecil Balmond]]. It is themed on the Cyrus Cylinder from 2,500 years ago, which is sometimes considered the first declaration of [[human rights]]. It commemorates the declaration of [[Cyrus the Great]], King of [[History of Iran|ancient Iran]], granting individual and religious freedoms to those within his empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://la.curbed.com/2017/7/5/15923494/la-freedom-sculpture-century-city-cylinder | title=Century City Freedom Sculpture unveiled on Santa Monica Boulevard median| date=2017-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-freedom-sculpture-20170704-story.html | title='Los Angeles embodies diversity.' the city's new sculpture celebrating freedom is unveiled - Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Directive Communication Psychology''' (DC) is a [[training]] and [[organization development|organisational development]] [[psychology]] developed by [[Arthur F. Carmazzi]] that reveals how people act and react in groups while providing a structure for the influence of those groups.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://directivecommunication.net/directive-communication-psychology/|title=Fear|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citehr.com/283867-directive-communication-psychology-developing-positive-traits-employees.html|title=Directive Communication Psychology: Developing Positive Traits In The Employees  - CiteHR|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Colored-Brain-Communication-Field-Manual/dp/1442126205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aiobp.org/organization/directive-communication-international/|title=Directive Communication International - AIOBP|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The name, "''Directive Communication''", refers to the idea that communication is constant, and, is constantly causing and effecting the individuals and groups involved whether it is verbal or non-verbal. Therefore, understanding the psychological element and derived models of how these cause and effects come about, allows a person to consciously "Direct" his communication to achieve a purposeful and desired effect in group behavior.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="carmazzi.net"&gt;http://carmazzi.net/pdf_files/Organizational%20Development%20with%20DC%20psychology%20to%20enhance%20the%20workforce%20and%20develop%2&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The discipline was founded in 2001 when Carmazzi found himself working in a dysfunctional organisation and performing at levels far below his own aptitude. While he was underperforming at work, he found himself to be innovative and perform well with his friends on various projects. He also found that different groups of friends brought out different facets of his attitude and personality, some being positive and others not. His findings were later published as he discovered that an individual’s performance was directly related to the unique group environment he or she was in. The initial work showed some people performed extremely well in one environment and, even with the same requirements, performed poorly in others. The group dynamics studies led the development of the 6 primary models that Carmazzi identified as foundations to understand how different mixes of individuals affect performance differently. The models supported individuals within a group to influence the dynamics and performance of that group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

One of the studies identified how a high achiever was put into a high performing team and the entire team began to perform poorly. In the same study, certain average achievers were combined and created high performing teams.&lt;ref name="directivecommunication.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://directivecommunication.net/team-motivation-connection-clusters|title=Team Motivation Clusters|date=9 April 2014|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="directivecommunication.net"/&gt; In 2007, the methodology was accredited by the American Institute of Business Psychology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

DC Psychology continues to be an expanding discipline with many contributors to the methodology including Lily C. Lau, Dr Raymond Phoon, Dr Leslie Choudhury, Waheed Albalushi, Col. Aalok Soodm Prachla Malhotra and Dr Marine Milad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/11145296/ESTABLISHING_A_BLENDED_LEARNING_ENVIRONMENT_ACCOMMODATING_DIFFERENT_BRAIN_COLOURS_AND_MULTIPLE_INTELLIGENCES|title=ESTABLISHING A BLENDED LEARNING ENVIRONMENT ACCOMMODATING DIFFERENT BRAIN COLOURS AND MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES|first=Marine|last=Milad|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
Directive Communication Psychology is the science of group dynamics. it identifies How and Why people act and react in groups, and the small modifications in behavior that leads to influencing those groups. Directive Communication became the science of organisational peak performance and was commercially applied to developing leadership, improving [[Organizational culture|corporate culture]], [[Team building|Team Development]], workforce enhancement and [[Group dynamics|group behavior modification]], and in high yield training and development. In a non-commercial environment, Directive Communication serves to cultivate better personal relationships, raising children, and becoming more fulfilled and responsible citizens.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

There are 307 Directive Communication certified trainers in 16 different countries including Iran, Pakistan, France, Malaysia, Singapore, Hungary, Bahrain, Qatar, China, UAE and Indonesia among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trainthetrainer.asia/train-the-trainer-enrollment/|title=Train the trainer course by Arthur Carmazzi|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key models==
*Circle of Tolerance – the level of negative stimulus a person can deal with intelligently before reacting.
*Colored Brain - How an individual genetically interprets information and surroundings, gets clarity on solutions, ideas and processes, and, sequencesaction from or through that clarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coloredbrain.com|title=Psychometric Test for Effective Communication with Colored Brain|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Emotional Drive – a set of 8 primary motivators that determine why people take or do not take action and why they react to people and environments in ways that either support or do not support their objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emotionaldrive.net|title=Homepage - HDMA|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Postures – a [[yoga]] based, mind/body connection model that supports the immediate and purposeful creation of mood in an individual to affect environment.
*Directive Questions – a questioning model to take the place of direct instruction in order to connect motivation, develop competence and increase trust and respect within teams.
*Core Identity – a process by which individuals find and nurture their own models of leadership, personal effectiveness and objective supporting attitudes by harnessing facets of who they are at their best in different environments. The model is said to enhance sustainability of new behaviors because in essence, they are not new and simply refined and redirected existing behaviors.

==Organizational culture change model==
The directive communication organizational change model is a bottom up process that was originally derived from the US Special forces and CIA force multiplication and revolution models. The objective of the model is to develop a more effective and engaged organizational culture through uniting the people within the organization to create an environment that supports their personal success and value through the organization, and therefore increasing engagement. It assumes the following points:

*It is easier for the masses to get buy-in from a small group of leaders than it is for a small group of leaders to get buy-in from the masses.
*Groups with a single greater purpose unite to achieve it.
*There are key influencers within an organization that people listen to and respect even if they do not have official titles. These people can influence their peers through trust that may be missing from the employee/management relationship.
*People, regardless of culture, age, position or education have very similar ideas about what is an ideal work environment. (this is based on an [[Arthur Carmazzi]] study conducted over 51 different countries and over 80,000 people determining the fundamental 5 consistent elements that subjects have defined as required for the ideal work environment).
*If there is a common enemy, groups that normally do not associate, will come together to fight against it.
*Ownership of the culture supports perpetuation of it. Employees may not own the company but they can own the culture. A culture initiative must separate the 2 for sustainability.
*In the instant information and gratification society we live in, if people do not see fast results that are supporting their success, they will lose interest and the initiative will get lost in the shuffle of being busy. A successful culture change initiative must show visible results in the first week of implementation to maintain ignite the motivation to continue.
*If given the opportunity, people want to solve the problems that are preventing them from becoming more successful at work. 
*A common language that supports emotional communication without conflict, supports the creation of an ideal working environment 
*The directive communication psychology and it intrinsic language supports the unification of people to achieve the greater common purpose of creating an ideal work environment and show visible results in a short time.

The culture change process has 4 criteria for it to work and be sustainable.

*Senior management must be involved.
*There will be a 2-week period where operations will be disrupted. 
*There may be negative influencers that must be removed from the organization or interaction with the majority of the staff. 
*The initiative only works with up to 1200 people at one time.

==Assumptions of Directive Communication Psychology==
Directive communication psychology has the following assumptions:&lt;ref name="carmazzi.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.culture-dynamics.com/main/3180/index.asp?pageid=162466&amp;t=directive-communication-psychology-trainer-certification&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesliechoudhury.com/index.php/directive-communication-psychology|title=Directive Communication Psychology|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/directive-communication-psychology-lenaghaz-lenaghaz-energylab|title=Directive Communication Psychology|date=16 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Individuals have potential to be inspired or uninspired at any given time, depending on their environment and their focus 
*Reactions to environment take place in the reptilian brain, and are a product of violated assumptions about the way that things should be 
*The reptilian brain does not reason and therefore reactions are “non-intelligent” actions 
*By understanding the psychology of how and why people act and react to each other in groups, an individual can change one consistent behavior in an environment, and affect the entire environment. 
*The subconscious actions based on assumptions about the way that people should be, manifest the way others treat them 
*Because of these subconscious actions, Everyone is personally responsible for the way others treat them and the creation of their own environment 
*“Personality” cannot be defined or categorized, it can only be “interpreted” by understanding the 3 separate components of character: the Mental, the Emotional, and the Physical 
*Each person Mentally processes the world around them based on a genetic brain processing, and While we cannot change our genetic processors, we learn “software” to compensate 
*Our Emotional Motivations are driven by eight primary emotional drivers, these are products of our environment and are subject to change over time 
*We have habitual physical postures that affect our focus, attitudes and the way our environment interacts with us.

==Training tools and assessments==
Directive communication psychology training focuses with the idea that learning retention and implementation could be improved with what founder, Arthur Carmazzi, calls “stacked learning”. Using sets of proprietary training tools developed by Carmazzi, a directive communication-based training game incorporates real world context into a specific learning point, the next learning point and game reinforces the earlier one and so on. Each game or exercise for new learning is “stacked” on, and emphasizes each previous learning.
 
This has led to further development of reflective tools such as the Colored Brain Communication Cards: a series of 54 images that, when put in context of a question, elicit subconscious values, lost knowledge, and expanded clarity about the question.

The methodology and tools expand from contributions from its certified trainers and practitioners such as The Choudhury Mind Maze Developed by Dr. Leslie Choudhury that emphasizes 5 out of the 6 Directive Communication models.

The Directive Communication assessments are also related to the various games.

*The Colored Brain Communication Inventory (CBCI) determines the Colored Brain or specific genetic process for getting clarity of a user.
*The Human Drive Mirrored Assessment (HDMA) identifies the “perception gaps” of how an individual sees themselves compared to how they are seen be subordinates, peers and superiors 
*The Corporate Culture Evolution Evaluation (CCEE) determining at which of the five levels of organizational culture (according to Carmazzi’s Culture Model) an organization’s culture is at.

Assessments are also subject to expansion from the Directive Communication community with contributions to accuracy and further application. One contribution by Lily C. Lau expanded the practicality of the Colored Brain assessment by adding depth to the application of “the second color” with her own research in 2013.

==Applications==
* Leadership
* Team effectiveness
* Engagement 
* Organizational culture enhancement and change
* Sales and marketing
* Customer service
* Training and learning effectivness

==Certification, and practitioner standards==
There are two maincertifications, “trainer” and “practitioner”. Additional certifications such as culture change, gamification, and master trainer,must have a minimum trainer certification before they can be attained. As an accredited methodology from the American Institute of Business Psychology, the Directive Communication psychology trainer certification is subject to two examinations. A practical examination where no more than 3 out of 50 questions can be missed for a passing grade, and a practical for the psychology based delivery methods related to training and increasing retention and implementation of concepts. Trainer certifications can only be delivered and certified by official Directive Communication Certified Master Trainers.

The practitioner certification is available live by certified Directive Communication master trainers and in online format. It is a prerequisite for the trainer certification. The practitioner certification requires only passing a written test with 20 questions per module and cannot miss more than 2 out of 20. The test is taken online.

The '''Doctor of Commerce''' ('''DCom''')&lt;ref&gt;General information can be accessed via, for example, the [[South African Qualifications Authority|SAQA]] [http://regqs.saqa.org.za/search.php?cat=qual qualifications page] or the [[New Zealand Qualifications Authority|NZQA]] [http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/qualifications-standards/qualifications/ qualifications page] searching for "doctor of commerce".&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[doctoral degree]] in [[commerce]]-, [[accounting]]-, [[economics]]-, and [[management]]-related subjects, awarded by universities in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. The degree is offered both as a [[higher doctorate]], and as a [[research doctorate]].

The higher doctorate&lt;ref&gt;See for example the universities of [http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/regulations/award/dcom_regs.shtml Canterbury], [http://www.otago.ac.nz/courses/qualifications/dcom.html Otago], [http://clm.ukzn.ac.za/Libraries/Information_for_students/CLM_sflb.sflb.ashx Kwazulu-Natal], [http://courses.handbooks.uwa.edu.au/courses/c4/40910 Western Australia] and [http://www.wits.ac.za/files/gr264_189955001326275256.pdf Witwatersrand]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
is awarded for published work of the candidate, demonstrating original contributions of "special excellence" in some branch of commerce. The candidate will be a graduate of the university in question.

The research doctorate&lt;ref&gt;See for example the [http://www.univen.ac.za/management_sciences/manage_programmes.html University of Venda] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608233931/http://www.univen.ac.za/management_sciences/manage_programmes.html |date=June 8, 2012 }} and  [http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&amp;ContentID=26739 UNISA].&lt;/ref&gt; is largely comparable to a [[PhD]] and in fact "Doctor of Commerce" may refer to a commerce-related [[PhD]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example [http://www.victoria.ac.nz/vms/study/postgraduate/phd.aspx Victoria University of Wellington] and [http://www.nmmu.ac.za/default.asp?id=4882&amp;aq=B%2B&amp;fc=1400&amp;bhcp=1 Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, at some universities the degree-title conferred will be a function of the candidate’s background: for example, in [[operations research]], the degree may be a PhD or a DCom, depending on whether the candidate held a [[Master of Science]] or [[Master of Commerce]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;For example, at [http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&amp;ContentID=24967 UNISA], and the [http://www.univen.ac.za/management_sciences/manage_programmes.html University of Venda] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608233931/http://www.univen.ac.za/management_sciences/manage_programmes.html |date=June 8, 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, in some cases, the degree title may also depend on the area of the research: a thesis focused on a more theoretical area (e.g. [[financial economics|"finance"]]) will be awarded a PhD, while one focused on a specific area or function (e.g. [[Managerial finance|financial management]]) will be awarded a DCom.&lt;ref&gt;For example, at the [http://www.uj.ac.za/EN/Faculties/ecofin/departments/fininvestman/coursesandprogrammes/postgraduate/Pages/5PhDinFinance.aspx University of Johannesburg] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106065404/http://www.uj.ac.za/EN/Faculties/ecofin/departments/fininvestman/coursesandprogrammes/postgraduate/Pages/5PhDinFinance.aspx |date=January 6, 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, in some cases the distinction will be whether the degree includes coursework or is entirely thesis based.&lt;ref&gt;For example, at the [http://web.up.ac.za/default.asp?ipkCategoryID=578&amp;sub=1&amp;parentid=40&amp;subid=575&amp;ipklookid=3 University of Pretoria] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227140522/http://web.up.ac.za/default.asp?ipkCategoryID=578&amp;sub=1&amp;parentid=40&amp;subid=575&amp;ipklookid=3 |date=December 27, 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The research doctorate is usually accessed following a [[Business education#Postgraduate education|related master's degree]], often the [[Master of Commerce]].  Here, there is generally a requirement that the [[master’s degree]] in question must include a research component, either comprising [[coursework]] with research, or being solely [[thesis]]-based.

The '''Fumio Koizumi Prize''' ({{lang-ja|小泉文夫音楽賞}}) is an [[international]] [[award]] for achievements in [[ethnomusicology]], presented annually in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. The prize is awarded by the Fumio Koizumi (小泉文夫) Trust each April 4, the date of Fumio's birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geidai.ac.jp/labs/koizumi/chosakue/index.html  List of publications of Koizumi Fumio]&lt;/ref&gt; The recipient receives an award certificate in addition to prize money. The winners must be present at the ceremony, deliver a prize lecture, and deliver another lecture at another Japanese university of his/her choice.

==Entry and prize consideration==
Nominations for the Fumio Koizumi Prize can be made only by the members of the Fumio Koizumi Prize [[Committee]]. The prize Committee consists of seven members, outstanding [[Japan]]ese scholars in [[musicology]] and [[ethnomusicology]]. Committee designates independent [[expert]]s to evaluate each entry and discusses all the entries at the meeting, held in [[Tokyo]] in December. The winner can be a single scholar, of a group of scholars. The prize awarding ceremony is held in Tokyo, in April–May.

==History==
The '''Fumio Koizumi Trust''' was established by '''Koizumi Mieko''', widow of Professor '''Koizumi Fumio''' (1927–83), on October 11, 1989, to commemorate her husband's lifelong devotion to [[ethnomusicology]] and to honour individuals and organizations who have made significant contributions to this field. The first Fumio Koizumi Prize was awarded in 1989 to a British ethnomusicologist [[John Blacking]], and to Ethnomusicology Research Group of [[Tokyo University of the Arts|Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music]]. Up to now, 27 individuals and 2 groups have been awarded this prize. List of the winners of the prize together with the reasons for the award can be seen at the Fumio Koizumi Prize in Ethnomusicology Website &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geidai.ac.jp/labs/koizumi/awarde/index.html  List of winners of Fumio Koizumi Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; From 2009 year onwards presented prize lecture texts are also placed on the prize website.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5818">'''Hands-on computing''' is a branch of [[human-computer interaction]] research which focuses on computer interfaces that respond to human touch or expression, allowing the machine and the user to interact physically. Hands-on computing can make complicated computer tasks more natural to users by attempting to respond to motions and interactions that are natural to human behavior. Thus hands-on computing is a component of [[user-centered design]], focusing on how users physically respond to virtual environments.

==Implementations==

* [[Keyboard (computing)|Keyboards]]
* [[Stylus (computing)|Stylus pens]] and [[Graphics tablet|tablets]]
* [[Touchscreen]]s&lt;ref name="micrord"&gt;http://research.microsoft.com/sendev/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Human signaling

===Keyboards===
Keyboards and [[typewriter]]s are some of the earliest hands-on computing devices. These devices are effective because users receive kinesthetic feedback, tactile feedback, auditory feedback, and visual feedback. The [[QWERTY]] layout of the keyboard is one of the first designs, dating to 1878.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;Baber, Christopher. ''Beyond the Desktop''. Academic Press. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; New designs such as the [[ergonomic keyboard#Split Keyboard|split keyboard]] increase the comfort of typing for users. Keyboards input directions to the computer via [[push-button|keys]]; however, they do not allow the user direct interaction with the computer through touch or expression.

===Stylus pens and tablets===
Tablets are touch-sensitive surfaces that detect the pressure applied by a [[Stylus (computing)|stylus pen]]. This works via changes in magnetic fields or by bringing together two resistive sheets, for magnetic tablets and resistive tablets respectively. Tablets allow users to interact with computers by touching through a stylus pen, yet they do not respond directly to a user's touch.

===Touchscreens===
Touchscreen allow users to directly interact with computers by touching the screen with a finger. It is natural for humans to point to objects in order to show a preference or a [[Selection (user interface)|selection]]. Touchscreens allow users to take this natural action and use it to interact with computers. Problems may arise due to inaccuracy: people attempt to make a selection, but due to incorrect calibration, the computer does not accurately process the touch.

===Human signaling===
New developments in hands-on computing have led to the creation of interfaces that can respond to [[gesture]]s and facial signaling. Often [[Haptic technology|haptic]] devices like a glove have to be worn to translate the gesture into a recognizable command. The natural actions of pointing, grabbing, and tapping are common ways to interact with the computer interface. The latest studies{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} include using eye signals to indicate selection or control a [[cursor (computers)|cursor]]. Blinking and the gaze of the eye are used to communicate selections. Computers can also respond to speech inputs. Developments in this technology have made it possible for users to dictate phrases to the computer instead of type them to display text on an interface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2001/apr01/04-18xpspeech.mspx]&lt;/ref&gt; Utilizing human signal inputs allows more people to interact with computers in a natural way.

==Current problems==

There are still many problems with hands-on computing interfaces that are currently being eradicated through continuing research and development. The challenge of creating a simple, user-friendly interface and developing it in an inexpensive and mass-producible way is the main complication in hands-on computing technologies. Because some interactions between human and machine are ambiguous, the mechanical response is not always the desired result for the user. Different hand gestures and facial expressions can lead the computer to interpret one command, while the user wished to convey another one entirely. Solving this problem is currently one of the main focuses in research and development.

Researchers are also working to find the best way to design hands-on computing devices, so that the consumer can use the product easily. Focusing on [[user-centered design]] while creating hands-on computing products helps developers make the best and easiest-to-use product.

==Research and development==
This new field has a lot of room for contributions in research and product development. Hands-on computing technologies require scientists and engineers to use a different problem-solving strategy, which considers the devices for interaction rather than just input, the interaction devices in terms of tool use, how interaction will mediate user performance, and the context in which the devices will be used.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

In order for a machine to be successfully used, people need to be able to transfer some of their current skill set to operate it. This can be done directly, by comparing the interface to a known and familiar topic to help people understand, or by aiding the user to draw new inferences through feedback. Users must be able to understand how to use and manipulate the interface, in order to use it to its full capability. By applying their current skills, users can operate the machine without learning new concepts and approaches.&lt;ref name="waern"&gt;Waern, Y. "Human Learning of Human-Computer Interaction: An Introduction." Cognitive Ergonomics: Understanding, Learning and Designing Human-Computer Interaction (1990): 69-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Historical institutionalism''' ('''HI''') is a [[new institutionalism|new institutionalist]] social science method that uses [[institutions]] to find sequences of social, political, economic [[behavior]] and [[Social change|change]] across time. It is a comparative approach to the study of all aspects of human [[organizations]] and does so by relying heavily on [[case studies]].

Borrowing from [[Charles Tilly]], historical institutionalism is a method apt for measuring "big structures, large processes, and [making] huge comparisons".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Tilly. (1984). "Big structures, Large Processes, and Huge Comparisons".&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical institutionalism has generated some of the most important books in the fields of sociology, political science and economics. In fact, some of these studies have inspired policy and its scholars have received numerous awards. Although historical institutionalism proper is fairly new (ca. 1979), it identifies with the great traditions in history, philosophy, politics, sociology and economics.

==Old and new institutionalism==
[[Institutions]] have been always central to [[social science]] but they have not been addressed with the same emphasis and manner in every approach. Before and after the turn of the twentieth century, several scholars were writing about institutions, but they had not developed a theory of institutions yet. Most of these approaches relied heavily on the study of formal institutions (i.e. the law) (see [[hermeneutics]]). Moreover, they were highly [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] and, thus, prescriptive (i.e. Weber prescribed the professionalization of bureaucracy in order to have a modern state). This is often called "old institutionalism".{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

During the 1950s, [[structural-functionalism]] blurred the study of institutions. They were more concerned about the variability of the [[modernization]] process across countries and about prescribing and generalizing at the systemic level rather than acknowledging the different paths that [[Development studies|development]] can take. (i.e. [[Gabriel Almond]] and [[Sidney Verba]], ''The Civic Culture'').{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The new institutionalism begins with the works of [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]], ''Political Order in Changing Societies''; [[Barrington Moore]]'s, ''Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy'', and more specifically [[Theda Skocpol]]'s, ''States and Social Revolutions''. These books spawned the new [[research program]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

As stated above, before HI arrived, institutions were only treated as the formal rules of behavior (i.e. the law). In contrast, historical institutionalism has loosened the definition of institutions. In this new approach, institutions can take the shape of a formal bureaucratic structure but also an ideology or an informal custom. The significance of this change of approach is that historical institutionalism denies that power and history have only one source as past approaches (i.e. the state) and has given agency to all kinds of social groups and behaviors (e.g. in ''[[Weapons of the Weak]]'', [[James C. Scott|James Scott]] acknowledges the power of "gossip" in political life.) In emphasizing the participation of all kind of groups, not just elites or the state, historical institutionalism offers a dynamic approach to history.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Moreover, HI avoids prescription. On the contrary, since historical institutionalism is interested in the richness and different paths that a [[revolution]] or an [[economic reform]] can take given that different groups participate in each case, they are sensitive to the differences that can occur when following a particular political design (i.e. democracy). In that sense, it also avoids the teleological determinism of past approaches. For historical institutionalists, actors are both produced by, and are producers of, history.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==The treatment of history==
Unlike most western scholars who preceded them, including [[classical liberalism|classical liberals]], [[classical Marxism|classical Marxists]], [[empiricism|empiricists]], [[dialectic]]al thinkers and [[positivism|positivists]], historical institutionalists do not accept that history necessarily develops in a straightforward, linear fashion. Instead, they examine the conditions under which a particular trajectory was followed and not others, a phenomenon that [[Gabriel Almond]] refers to as the "historical cure".&lt;ref&gt;Almond, Gabriel. (1956). "Comparative Political Systems." ''Journal of Politics'', 18, pp. 391-409&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, specifying why particular paths were ''not'' taken is as important as specifying the actual trajectory of history.

As opposed to the old institutionalists, they postulate that history will not necessarily lead to a "happy" outcome (i.e. "[[fascism]] or [[democracy]] as the end of history").

The most basic concept with which historical institutionalists work is the concept of [[path dependence]].&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2012. Options for moving beyond the canonical model of regional path dependence. International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 36(1), pp.172-178. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2427.2011.01090.x/full&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Martin, R., 2012. (Re) Placing path dependence: a response to the debate. International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 36(1), pp.179-192.&lt;/ref&gt; Theda Skocpol and Paul Pierson write that [[path dependence]] does not have yet a clear definition, but can express the idea that "outcomes at a 'critical juncture' trigger feedback mechanisms [negative or positive] that reinforce the recurrence of a particular pattern into the future". In their view, the significance of path dependence is that:

: "once actors have ventured far down a particular path, they are likely to find it very difficult to reverse course…The "path not taken" or the political alternatives that were once quite plausible may become irretrievably lost. 'Path dependence analysis' highlights the role of what [[Arthur Stinchcombe]] has termed 'historical causation' in which dynamics triggered by an event or process at one point in time reproduce themselves, even in the absence of the recurrence of the original event or process".&lt;ref&gt;Pierson, Paul &amp; Skocpol, Theda. 2002. "Historical Institutionalism in Contemporary Political Science", in Ira Katznelson &amp; Helen V. Milner (eds). Political Science: State of the Discipline. New York: W.W. Norton: 693-721.&lt;/ref&gt;

A related crux of historical institutionalism is that temporal sequences matter: outcomes depend upon the timing of [[exogenous]] factors (such as inter-state competition or economic crisis) in relation to particular institutional configurations (such as the level of [[bureaucratic]] professionalism or degree of state autonomy from class forces).&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2010. Beware of contingency. Environment and planning D: Society and Space, 28(3), pp.388-396. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/d2310?journalCode=epda&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Theda Skocpol]] suggests that the [[democracy|democratic]] outcome of the [[English Civil War]] was a result of the fact that the comparatively weak English [[The Crown|Crown]] lacked the [[military]] capacity to fight the landed upper-class. In contrast, the rise of rapid [[industrialization]] and [[fascism]] in [[Prussia]] when faced with international security threats was because the Prussian state was a "highly bureaucratic and centralized agrarian state" composed by "men closely ties to landed [[notables]]".&lt;ref&gt;Skocpol, Theda. (1973). A Critical Review of Barrington Moore's Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy. "Politics and Society", 4(1), pp. 1-34.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Ertman]], in his account of state building in [[medieval]] and early modern [[Europe]], argues that variations in the type of [[regime]] built in Europe during this period can be traced to one macro-international factor and two historical institutional factors. At the macro-structural level, the "timing of the onset of sustained geopolitical competition" created an atmosphere of insecurity that appeared best addressed by consolidating state power. The timing of the onset of competition is critical for Ertman's explanation. States that faced competitive pressures early had to consolidate through [[patrimonial structures]], since the development of modern bureaucratic techniques had not yet arrived. States faced with competitive pressures later could on the other hand, could take advantage of advancements in training and knowledge to promote a more technical oriented [[civil service]].&lt;ref&gt;Ertman, Thomas. (1997). "Birth of the Leviathan: Building States and Regimes in Medieval and Early Modern Europe". Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, Richard. (2002, October). "In Debate: The Casual Focus of Historical Institutionalism". Paper presented at Temple University course seminar on Authoritarian Regimes, Philadelphia, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems==
Historical institutionalism is not a unified intellectual enterprise (see also [[new institutionalism]]). Some scholars are oriented towards treating history as the outcome of rational and purposeful behavior based on the idea of equilibrium (see [[rational choice]]). They rely heavily on quantitative approaches. Others, more qualitative oriented scholars, reject the idea of rationality and instead emphasize the idea that randomness and accidents matter in political and social outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;S. Steinmo, K. Thelen, and F. Longstreth, eds., Structuring Politics: Historical Institutionalism in Comparative Analysis, (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; There are unsolvable [[epistemological]] differences between both approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Robert et al. Analytic Narratives, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt; However given the historicity of both approaches, and given their focus on institutions, both can fall under "historical institutionalism".
* It could be said that path dependence claims causality because every juncture must be considered causal to further developments. (i.e. Z couldn't occur without W, X and Y) In that sense, it is more deterministic than statistical analysis because the latter acknowledge only probabilistic relations among variables. "Correlation is not causation".
* Path dependence, in the economic sense, is also subjective because it involves the judgment of the researcher in determining which historical [[conjunctures]] had an effect on the outcome why others don't (selecting on the dependent variable).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The subjectivity becomes accentuated because one can claim that the smallest historical event can shape the larger outcomes. (For example, if a man got drunk, and the next morning, he was involved in manufacturing 20 rifles that were sent to the same regiment, the rifles would not aim right and the battle would be lost and then the war). Where should we trace the causal thread? How much history is needed?

[[File:Palac-staszica.jpg|thumb|Staszic Palace - headquarters of INE PAN]]
'''Institute of Economics, Polish Academy of Sciences''' ({{lang-pl|Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych PAN}}, abbreviation: '''INE PAN''') is a public Polish research center for economic and business studies. It was founded on December 10, 1980. Its offices are located in the [[Staszic Palace]] and the [[Palace of Culture and Science]] in [[Warsaw]]. Organizationally, it is part of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Polish Academy of Sciences - the Past and the Present, ed. Jan Strelau, Warsaw, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute of Economics has the rights to bestow doctoral degrees, habilitation degrees and to initiate the professorship procedure. Some of its MBA and DBA prominent programs are the most modern programs in Poland which are internationally recognized.

==History==

The PAS Institute of Economics commenced its activities in 1980. Its research at that time concentrated on problems related to socialist planned economies. During the 80s IE PAS was actively engaged in the promotion of independent thinking on economic issues. It significantly contributed to the success of Polish economic reforms after the collapse of the socialist system in 1989. 

In the 90s the Institute was reorganized and took active part in the analysis and evaluation of free market economic developments in Poland.  At present there are about forty scholars and researchers working in four departments of the Institute: Microeconomics, Economic Policy, Institutional Economics and  the World Economy. Many of them have occupied important posts in the [[Cabinet of Poland]], [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|Parliament (Sejm)]], the [[National Bank of Poland]], the Polish [[Monetary Policy Council]], the [[European Commission]] and the [[World Bank]].

==Research and Other Activities==

IE PAS’s main research areas are:

- contemporary economic theory, 

- economic policy, 

- analysis, evaluation and strategic studies of the Polish economy, and 

- analysis of the world economy and European integration.

IE PAS also offers forecasts concerning growth and development of the Polish economy, and publishes a number of analyses of Polish firms. The Institute also publishes the bilingual quarterly ''Studia Ekonomiczne - Economic Studies''. 

IE PAS maintains cooperation with leading institutions in various countries, e.g. the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies; the Institute of Economics of the Russian Academy of Sciences; the Institute of World Economy of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and the [[University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne]]. 

IE PAS also runs several postgraduate, MBA and doctoral programs in business and economics.  Together with the [[National Bank of Poland]] the Institute offers specialized studies for economic journalists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inepan.waw.pl/en/], Institute of Economics of the Polish Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific Council and Board of Directors==

Professor Barbara Błaszcyk is Chairman of the Scientific Council of IE PAS. Urszula Skorupska serves as the Director of the Institute.

The following professors served as Directors of the Institute of Economics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in the past:

- Józef Pajestka (1981–1990),

- Cezary Józefiak (1990–1993),

- [[Marek Belka]] (1993–1996),

- Urszula Grzelońska (1996–1999),

- Zbigniew Hockuba (1999–2005),&lt;ref&gt;[[:pl:Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych PAN]], Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych PAN.&lt;/ref&gt;

- Leszek Jasiński (2005-2013),

- Cezary Wójcik (2013-2015),

- Piotr Krajewski (2015-2018).

'''Joseph Pitts''' (1663–1735?) was an Englishman who was taken into slavery by Barbary pirates from Algeria in 1678 at the age of fourteen or fifteen. Little is known about Pitts aside from what is revealed in his narrative concerning his time held captive in Northern Africa, during which time he went through three masters ranging widely in their cruelty towards him over the course of more than fifteen years, with whom he travelled to Cairo and Alexandria. Though he escaped between the years 1693 and 1694, it was not until 1704 that Pitts first published his account. Pitts's ''A True and Faithful Account of the Religion and Manners of the Mohammetans, with an Account of the Author's Being Taken Captive'' includes descriptions of his capture and captivity, including some of the first English descriptions of Islamic rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, Joseph. ''A True and Faithful Account of the Religion and Manners of the Mohammetans, with an Account of the Author's Being Taken Captive'' (1704) reprinted in ''Piracy, Slavery, and Redemption: Barbary Captivity Narratives from Early Modern England'', ed. Daniel J. Vitkus (New York: Columbia University Press, 2001), 218–340&lt;/ref&gt; Converting to the religion while a slave, Pitts was the first Englishman to record the proceedings of the hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam. Pitts also describes the people of seventeenth-century North Africa (whom he calls Turks or Mohammetans) in detail, providing particulars on their manner of eating and dressing, the customs of their religion and marriage, and their economic and slave systems. Though its accuracy is debatable, Pitts’s narrative was the first and most detailed description of the religion of Islam and the manners of Muslims written by a European during the seventeenth century.

== Pitts and the hajj ==

It was during Pitts’s time with his last master that he made his journey to [[Mecca]] to complete the [[hajj]]. Having converted to Islam under the urgings and tortures of his second master Ibrahim, Pitts departed for the hajj with his third master around 1685. His account described many of the aspects of the Islamic pilgrimage including the hajj caravans, the rites at Mecca, and the customary but not mandatory visit to [[Medina]]. Much of Pitts's account of the hajj can be verified as accurate, but there is debate as to the truthfulness of some of his relations.

=== Initial rites ===

As a pilgrim, Pitts participated in the initial rites upon arriving in Mecca. This time is filled with the pilgrims' first tawaf, cleansing and drinking at the [[Zamzam Well]], and completion of the sa 'y or sa 'i. Scholars seem to disagree as to what brought about this tradition, whether a re-enactment of Mohammad's reclaiming of the temple for Islam or that of the seven planets rotating around the sun.&lt;ref name="InsideMecca"&gt;''Inside Mecca''. Dir. Taghi Amirani &amp; Anisa Mehdi. National Geographic Television, 2003. DVD; Wolfe, Michael. ''One Thousand Roads to Mecca''. New York: Grove Press, 1997. xxii–xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the real reasoning or meaning behind the seven turnings around the Ka ‘ba, it became a part of the Islamic tradition of the hajj and was being performed by pilgrims immediately upon their arrival well before Pitts’s time. After this ritual is the cleansing at the Zamzam Well, something Pitts seems to have left out of his narrative. Peters describes the Islamic legend tracing the origins of this well to a time when Abraham’s wife Hagar was left in the middle of the desert with their son Ishmael who was dying of thirst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Peters|first=F.E.|title=The Hajj: The Muslim Pilgrimage to Mecca and the Holy Places|location=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1994|pages=197 &amp; 199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desperately running back and forth in search of water between two low hills called Safa and Marwa, God brought forth water from a spot in the desert for Hagar to give to her child.&lt;ref name="InsideMecca" /&gt; An example of this interaction with the Zamzam Well shortly after the tawaf can be found in an account by Ali Bey al-Abbasi, a Spaniard who went on the hajj in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Michael. ''One Thousand Roads to Mecca''. New York: Grove Press, 1997. 146 &amp; 149; Peters, F.E. ''The Hajj: The Muslim Pilgrimage to Mecca and the Holy Places''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994. 197 &amp; 199.&lt;/ref&gt;  In chapter 7 of his narrative, Pitts mentions the drinking of the water but not in connection with these initial rites. Whether this is due to a mistake by Pitts or a genuine difference in the order of the hajj of the 1600s is hard to determine. However, this initial water rite then brings pilgrims to what is called the sa ‘y, a recreation of Hagar’s desperate search for water which they complete by running back and forth between the same hills seven times. Today this is completed within the mosque in Mecca called Masjid al-Haram. During Pitts’s time and up until the 1950s, this was completed out on the street.&lt;ref name="InsideMecca" /&gt;

=== Mount Arafat ===

The vigil at Mount Arafat is another important aspect of the hajj which Pitts discusses. In chapter 7, Pitts says that they leave Mecca to visit “a certain hill called Gibbel el orphat (or el-Arafat), i.e., the Mountain of Knowledge.” Here he witnesses them perform Yawm al-Wukuf or the Day of Standing Together before God. Islamic legend explains that this hill was the place where Adam and Eve met after their expulsion from the Garden of Eden as well as where the Day of Judgment will take place. For pilgrims, it is “a place set aside for spiritual reunion, where pilgrims travel to re-form family ties, seek pardon, and re-collect their spirits.”&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Michael. ''One Thousand Roads to Mecca''. New York: Grove Press, 1997. xxii–xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Though it is the “how, when, and where [pilgrims] receive this honorable title of hajji for which they are at all this pains and expense," Pitts claims that as to "why they so solemnly approach this mountain beyond any other place and receive from hence the title of hagges" he did not know, adding he gave "but little heed to these delusions."&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, "A True and Faithful Account", Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes the times that they perform their preparations for the prayers and rites to be completed while at the hill, and how "they [beg] earnestly for the remission of their sins and [promise] newness of life using a form of penitential expressions and thus continuing for the space of four or five hours."&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, ''A True and Faithful Account'', Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trauma ==

Pitts was subject to numerous forms of [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] during his enslavement.  These included:

* [[Blunt trauma|Physical trauma]], when he was repeatedly beaten by his patrons.
* [[Slavery|Enslavement]] trauma, described by Orlando Patterson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=Orlando|title=Slavery and Social Death|year=1982|publisher=Harvard College|location=Cambridge|isbn=067481083X|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a form of social death, wherein trauma is derived from the severance from any form of autonomy.
* [[Adoption]] trauma, wherein there is a traumatic component to being separated from the parent and later adopted by another.  Pitts's adoption, in emotion if not in law, by his third patroon had traumatic ramifications on Pitts' [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. 
Due to these traumatic experiences Pitts developed a form of [[PTSD]].  Many scholars of memoir and PTSD have noted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peres|first=Julio F. P.|author2=Alexander Moreira-Almeida, Antonia Gladys Nasello and Harold G. Koenig|title=Spirituality and Resilience in Trauma Victims|journal=Journal of Religion and Health|year=2007|pages=343–350|doi=10.1007/s10943-006-9103-0|volume=46|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Homans|first=Margaret|title=Adoption Narratives, Trauma and Origins|journal=Narrative|date=January 2006|volume=14|pages=4–26|doi=10.1353/nar.2005.0026}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the memoirs of the traumatised often take the form of a "working out" of the trauma, an examination of the causes and meanings of the trauma by a slow and steady examination of events to make sense of them.  This reflects itself in Pitts's writing in the slow and steady buildup to the chapters that talk about the incidents of severe trauma, such as the beating received from his first and second masters and the emotional complexities of his [[Religious conversion#Islam|conversion]] and later adoption.

== Sexuality, women, and slavery in Pitts's narrative ==

Pitts does not often mention women in his writings. It appears there are very few opportunities for him to be around women of any sort of status. However, the encounters he does write about give good insight into the Western views of Islamic attitudes about women. Pitts is not a stranger to violence. He is captured, enslaved, tortured, sold, and endures countless hardships throughout his journey. Pitts encounters violence against women several times in his account, most notably when describing the Imperial Turkish camps. He writes that the soldiers are "apt to drink, and are abominably rude, insomuch that it is very dangerous for any woman to walk in any by-place but more dangerous for boys, for they are extremely given to sodomy…" (236). In this passage, and in the context surrounding it, Pitts only mentions the danger to women once and focuses more acutely on the sin of sodomy amongst the soldiers. This shows that sexual violence is normalised for Pitts; he is much more concerned about the sin of sodomy than the sin of rape. He focuses intently on the immorality of sodomy but says nothing of the immorality of raping a woman.

In his discussion of marriage, Pitts describes how the marriage agreement takes place between the groom and the father of the bride. The woman's possible feelings or misgiving about the union are not mentioned at all. Pitts appears to perceive women as having little to no power in their relationships with men (242). He also discusses the idea of divorce and of Muslim men having multiple wives. According to Pitts, divorce is fairly common in the Islamic world and both parties are free to remarry afterwards. Multiple wives are not as common though; Pitts reports that very few men have multiple wives except out in the rural areas (243). These notions of power in relation to females are very much based in English ideas. Women in England gave up their property and dowries to their husbands upon marriage. Divorce was not common nor easy in England, although Pitts never details if a woman is allowed to ask for a divorce. Multiple wives were not as common among the middle and lower class of Muslim society; if Pitts did not rub elbows with the elite he would not have seen this phenomenon.

Pitts details a visit to a slave market in Cairo while he is on the hajj with one of his masters. In the market place, Pitts observes the selling of women and men. While men are forced to act out tricks to show off their strength and abilities like a horse show, the women are treated in a different manner. Women would be dressed in fine clothing when being exposed in markets, in hopes of catching a buyer's eye.&lt;ref name="Pitts1704" /&gt; Pitts says that while the women's faces were veiled, men were allowed to freely view their faces, to feel the inside of their mouths and teeth, and to caress their breasts. If a woman's virginity was questioned, slave traders would sometimes permit a potential buyer to escort the she-slave into a private tent, allowing the customer to discover the answer to the question themselves.&lt;ref name="Pitts1704" /&gt; He notes that many of the slaves are women and children as the men are kept as rowing slaves aboard ships. He also describes many of the people as "Muscovites and Russians, and from those parts and some of the emperor of Germany's parts" (270). These slaves have lighter skin, and they are dressed in fine clothing so they will fetch a higher price at auction.  The slaves are examined much like animals; buyers are allowed to checked their teeth, muscles, and stature to get an idea of the overall health of a slave.

== Pitts and his masters ==

Pitts served a total of three masters, with varying degrees of treatment. Not very much insight is given of his first master, but we do know that his second master, Ibrahim, treated him very poorly (318).&lt;ref name="Pitts1704"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pitts|first=Joseph|title=A True and Faithful Account of the Religion and Manners of the Mohammetans, with an Account of the Author's Being Taken Captive|year=1704|publisher=Exon|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of Pitts' capture, he mentions the poor diet that they were fed was equal to the treatment they received. When planning a mutinous revolt, Pitts describes how the rebellion was discovered. A man who was suspected of the idea of the uprising was brought forward in front of his fellow captives. Pitts states: ‘The captain, with a great rope, gave him about an hundred blows on his buttocks, but he would not confess the fact, generously choosing rather to suffer himself than to bring us all under the bastinadoes also’ (228).  Ellen Friedman points out that the free Muslim man’s diet was no better than the captives’.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Ellen|title=Christian Captive at Hard Labor|journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies|pages=116–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman also addresses that captives were treated harshly to make certain that they were kept in line and knew their place. Their self-worth was often undermined and the captives would be humiliated in front of their companions. Robert Davis, in the book ''Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast, and Italy'', says that ceaseless beatings and humiliation are established at the beginning of the capture to not only frighten new slaves, but to ensure silent obedience as well. Many slaves watched as their companions were reprimanded into bloody unconsciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Robert|title=Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast, and Italy, 1500–1800|publisher=Hampshire: Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitts’ narrative then turns to the forcing of converting to Islam. He states: ‘It hath been affirmed by some that the slaves that are sold in this country are never compelled to turn to the Mohammetan religion.’ While this is deemed true, there are rare cases like Pitts who have been forced into conversion. His second master, Ibrahim, had hung Pitts upside down, revealing the bottoms of his bare feet and dealing out 300 blows with a cudgel. Though Pitts had changed religions, Ibrahim treated him just as maliciously as he had before, beating Pitts until his blood poured onto the ground. This type of treatment was unusual. The Qur'an instructs masters to treat their slaves with firm kindness. Though they might not have shared the same expectations about work and life, master and slaves mutually understood and shared “a bundle of mutual obligations.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lovejoy|first=Paul E.|title=The Ideology of Slavery in Africa|year=1981|publisher=Beverly Hills: Sage Publications|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves were meant to be kept healthy to work efficiently. If slaves were unproductive in their line of work, then they would be punished.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Ellen G. "Christian Captive at Hard Labor." ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'' 13.4 (n.d.): 616-32; Clissold, Stephen. ''The Barbary Slaves''. 1st ed. Totowa: Rowman Littlefield, 1977. 86–101&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitts’ third and last master was more of an ideal master. While Pitts wanted nothing to do with his master from the beginning, he soon became affectionate towards him when he saw that the master intended to give him a letter of freedom (323). Pitts describes his master treating him like a son, seeing as he had no children or relatives to love. Pitts also saw him in a fatherly light and, after given the letter of freedom, continued to stay with him for he was so kind. Freeing a slave was looked at as a great act of piety, and the act could allow the slave master to be forgiven of his sins. Even serious sins such as murder could be forgiven by the freeing of a slave. When Pitts makes the decision to leave, escaping back to his native homeland, he becomes conflicted with the situation of whether or not he should leave his fatherlike master who had made promises of leaving all of his belongings to Pitts after his death (332).

== Controversy ==

=== Conversion ===

At the time period in which Pitts's narrative was written, many other writers of slave narratives were claiming, like Pitts, to have been forced or tricked into converting to Islam. However, research suggests that such claims were likely to be false. Research suggests that North Africa was religiously very tolerant at this time and that Christian captives who converted were likely to benefit from lying about having converted because the English Christians—their own families included—would have persecuted them.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Claire. "Lust, Greed, Torture, and Identity: Narrations of Conversion and the Creation of the Early Modern Renegade." ''Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East'' 29.2 (2009): 259–268. Project MUSE. Web. 1 March 2013. &lt;http://muse.jhu.edu/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This research suggests that Pitts might have done the same and that Pitts's alleged experience of having been forcibly converted would have been a special case, if true at all. More research, suggesting that Islam and renegades were often vilified in British culture and media, gives Pitts another reason to have lied about his conversion. Researchers describe the way, in English theatre at this time, renegades were often considered to be on par with Satan-worshipers and atheists, and traitors to their countries.&lt;ref&gt;Matar, Nabil. "The Renegade in English Seventeenth-Century Imagination." ''Studies in English Literature 1500–1900''. 33.3 (1993): 489–505; Clissold, Stephen. ''The Barbary Slaves''. 1st ed. Totowa: Rowman Littlefield, 1977. 86–101; Colley, Linda. ''Captives''. 1st ed. New York: Pantheon Books, 2002. 99–134.&lt;/ref&gt;  In direct reference to Pitts's writings, some research brings up the way that Pitts admitted to having been tempted to remain a Muslim, as well as admitting to the advantages offered him by doing so.&lt;ref&gt;Colley, Linda. ''Captives''. 1st ed. New York: Pantheon Books, 2002. 99–134. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical abuse ===

There is controversy within the academic community as to the veracity of the abuse that Pitts, and many of his fellow captives, received at the hands of their masters.  Many scholars cast doubt on Pitts’s account.  Claire Norton posits various reasons why beating a slave as a form of proselytisation would have been illogical.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Claire. "Lust, Greed, Torture, and Identity."&lt;/ref&gt; A slave beaten into conversion would be of no economical value as Muslims were socially pressured to free their slaves once they converted.  The Barbary Coast was also very egalitarian in its religious diversity, Christian services being held in various places, decreasing the likelihood that a Christian would have no place in Islamic society.

Other scholars, such as Robert Davis, also doubt the validity of many slave narratives while allowing that the use of violence against one slave served “as a warning to all the other slaves who might witness or hear of it to be on their best behavior.”&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Robert C. ''Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters''. 1st ed. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Pitts himself discredits the forced conversion trope, stating that this was a rare occurrence, “though it was my hard fortune to be so unmercifully dealt with.” However, Pitts provides a reason why his masters would have used violent force against him, namely that one of his masters had a sordid past and hoped to unburden his sins by forcing Pitts to convert and then freeing him, a holy rite within Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, ''A True and Faithful Account'', Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[fluid dynamics]], the '''Küssner effect''' describes the [[wikt:unsteady|unsteady]] [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] [[force]]s on an [[airfoil]] or [[hydrofoil]] caused by encountering a transverse [[Wind#Measurement|gust]]. This is directly related to the '''Küssner function''', used in describing the effect.

Küssner derived an approximate model for an airfoil encountering a sudden step-like change in the transverse gust [[velocity]] — or, equivalently, as seen from a [[frame of reference]] moving with the airfoil: a sudden change in the [[angle of attack]]. The airfoil is modelled as a flat plate in a [[potential flow]], moving with constant horizontal velocity.&lt;ref&gt;Cebeci (2005) pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; For this case he derived the [[impulse response function]] — known as Küssner function&lt;ref&gt;Bisplinghoff, Ashley and Halfman (1996) pp. 287–288.&lt;/ref&gt; — needed to compute the unsteady [[lift (force)|lift]] and [[torque|moment]] exerted by the air on the airfoil.

'''Left shift''' or '''blood shift''' is an increase in the number of immature [[leukocyte]]s in the peripheral [[blood]], particularly [[neutrophil]] [[band cell]]s.&lt;ref name=Robbins84&gt;{{Cite book

Less commonly, left shift may also refer to a similar phenomenon in severe [[anemia]], when [[reticulocyte]]s and immature [[erythrocyte]] precursors appear in the peripheral circulation.&lt;ref name=hematology&gt;{{Cite book

==Definition==
The standard definition of a left shift is an absolute band form count greater than 700/microL.&lt;ref&gt;

==Morphology==
It is usually noted on [[microscope|microscopic]] examination of a [[blood smear]]. This systemic effect of inflammation is most often seen in the course of an active [[infection]] and during other severe illnesses such as [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]]. [[Döhle bodies]] may also be present in the neutrophil's cytoplasm in the setting of sepsis or severe inflammatory responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Pathogenesis==
It is believed that cytokines (including [[Interleukin 1|IL-1]] and [[Tumor necrosis factors|TNF]]) accelerate the release of cells from the postmitotic reserve pool in the [[bone marrow]], leading to an increased number of immature cells.&lt;ref name=Robbins84/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17481">This is the '''list of the fields of doctoral studies in the United States''' used for the annual Survey of Earned Doctorates, conducted by [[NORC at the University of Chicago]] for the [[National Science Foundation]] and other federal agencies, as used for the 2015 survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvydoctorates/surveys/srvydoctorates_2015.pdf|pages= 6 &amp; 7 |title=Survey of Earned Documents questionnaire 2015 – Field of Study listing |publisher=NORC/NSF|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are fields of [[Doctorate#Research-oriented doctorates|research-oriented doctoral studies]], leading mostly to [[PhD]]s – in the academic year 2014–15, 98% of the 55,006 research doctorates awarded in the U.S. were PhDs; 1.1% were [[EdD]]s; 0.9% were other research doctorates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17306/data/taba2.pdf|title=Research degrees included in the Survey of Earned Doctorates: 2011–15|publisher=NSF|work=Doctorate Recipients from U.S. Universities: 2015|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Professional degree]]s, though they are also considered doctorates (earned, not honorary), and do entitle the holder to call themselves "Doctor", such as [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], [[Doctor of Dental Surgery|DDS]], [[Doctor of Veterinary Medicine|DVM]], [[Juris Doctor|JD]], [[Doctor of Pharmacy|DPharm]], [[Doctor of Ministry|DMin]] and [[Doctor of Psychology|PsyD]], are not included in the survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17306/technotes.cfm#|title=Technical Notes|publisher=NSF|at=Survey Design|work=Doctorate Recipients from U.S. Universities: 2015|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld: An Anthropology''''' is an [[anthropology|anthropological]] study of [[Paganism (contemporary)|contemporary Pagan]] and [[ceremonial magic]] groups that practiced [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] in London, England during the 1990s. It was written by English anthropologist Susan Greenwood based upon her doctoral research undertaken at [[Goldsmiths' College]], a part of the [[University of London]], and first published in 2000 by [[Berg Publishers]].

Greenwood became involved in the [[Western esotericism|esoteric movement]] during the 1980s as a practitioner of [[Dianic Wicca|a feminist form of Wicca]]. Devoting her doctorate to the subject, her research led her to join [[Kabbalistic]] orders and two [[Wicca]]n [[coven]]s, during which she emphasised that she was both an "insider" (a practising [[occultist]]) and an "outsider" (an anthropological observer). Reacting against the work of [[Tanya Luhrmann]], who had authored the primary anthropological study of the London occult scene, ''[[Persuasions of the Witch's Craft]]'' (1989), Greenwood argued against studying magical beliefs from a [[rationalism|western rationalist]] perspective, instead adopting a theoretical approach informed by [[phenomenology of religion|phenomenology]] and [[cultural relativism|relativism]]. Greenwood's research focused on Pagan and magical conceptions of the "[[otherworld]]". The book's first chapter summarises the Pagan magical conception of the otherworld, and subsequent chapters detail Greenwood's experiences with Kabbalistic magic and Wicca. The work goes on to discuss issues of [[psychotherapy]] and [[healing]], [[gender]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], and [[morality]] and [[ethics]] within London's esoteric community, and the manner in which the community's members' views on these issues are influenced by their beliefs regarding an otherworld.

''Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld'' was reviewed by various figures involved in both academia and the Pagan community including Douglas Ezzy and [[Phil Hine]]. Greenwood herself would go on to author several other books on the relationship between magic and anthropology.

==Background==

===Anthropological fieldwork into Paganism===

Prior to Greenwood's work, several academic researchers working in the field of [[Pagan studies]] had published investigations of the Pagan community in the United States and the United Kingdom. First among these was the practicing Wiccan, journalist and political activist [[Margot Adler]] in her ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today]]'', published by [[Viking Press]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adl79|Adler 1979]].&lt;/ref&gt; A second study was produced by anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann|Tanya M. Luhrmann]] in ''[[Persuasions of the Witch's Craft|Persuasions of the Witch's Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England]]'' (1989), in which she focused on a Wiccan coven and several ceremonial magic orders based in London.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Luh89|Luhrmann 1989]].&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Allen Scarboro, psychologist Nancy Campbell and Wiccan literary critic Shirley Stave undertook fieldwork in the Ravenwood coven of [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], over several months across 1990 and 1991 as the basis for ''[[Living Witchcraft|Living Witchcraft: A Contemporary American Coven]]'', published by Praeger in 1994,&lt;ref name="Scarboro"&gt;[[#Sca94|Scarboro, Campbell and Stave 1994]].&lt;/ref&gt; while anthropologist and Wiccan Loretta Orion investigated the Pagan movement in the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] of the U.S. for ''[[Never Again the Burning Times|Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited]]'', published by Waveland Press in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ori95|Orion 1995]].&lt;/ref&gt; 1997 saw the publication of ''[[Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia]]'', authored by anthropologist Lynne Hume.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greenwood and her research===
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|bgcolor=#ACE1AF|quote="This is a study of certain ideas, philosophies, practices and groups within the [[Western esotericism|Western esoteric tradition]] in the last decade of the twentieth century. I explore, through issues concerning magical identity, gender, and morality, aspects of what magicians term the 'otherworld'."|source=—Susan Greenwood, 2000.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 ix"&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; }}
As a child, Greenwood had found a greater spiritual connection with the natural world than with [[organised religion]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 ix"/&gt; During the late 1970s, she embraced [[second-wave feminism]] and came across feminist forms of Pagan Witchcraft through [[Starhawk]]'s ''[[Dreaming the Dark: Magic, Sex, and Politics|Dreaming the Dark]]'' (1982).&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 ix"/&gt; Attracted to this new religious movement, she undertook an undergraduate degree in anthropology and sociology at Goldsmiths' College, where her final year research project focused on women's spirituality. Exploring the topic in further depth, she devoted a PhD to the subject, thereby conducting the research underpinning ''Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld''.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 ix"/&gt;

Although initially planning to gather data through formal taped interviews with participants, she rejected this method, believing it solidified her "outsider" status among the subculture she was studying. Instead, her data was collected through informal conversations with practitioners, during which she tried to make clear that she was an anthropologist and would use their comments in her work.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 17"&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;
Over the course of her research, Greenwood gained many friends within the city's Pagan community, and became sexually and emotionally attached to one magician.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 17"/&gt; Greenwood's research was funded using grants from the University of London Central Research Fund and from the [[Economic and Social Research Council]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 x"&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; She devoted the published work to her children, Adrian and Lauren.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 x"/&gt;

==Synopsis==

[[Image:RWS Tarot 05 Hierophant.jpg|thumb|150px|Greenwood includes in her work an image of Tarot card "The Hierophant", which she was taught to meditate on while working with Qabalistic magic.]]

Chapter one describes contemporary Paganism and defines "the otherworld". It discusses London's magical and Pagan subculture in the 1990s, and Greenwood's relationship with it. Admitting to being an "insider", she explores her mixed feelings at being both a practicing Pagan and an anthropological observer.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 1&amp;ndash;20.&lt;/ref&gt;
The second chapter examines the community's conceptions of the otherworld, explaining how they approach it through acts of visualisation and [[altered states of consciousness]] and their understandings of it as a realm of spiritual energy connected to dreams and the imagination. Discussing the relationship between anthropology and magic, Greenwood argues that it is impossible for anthropologists to truly understand beliefs regarding magic and the otherworld if they only view it through a western rationalist lens, instead arguing for a [[Phenomenology of religion|phenomenological]] or [[relativism|relativist]] perspective that accepts alternative views of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 23&amp;ndash;47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her third chapter, Greenwood examines her experiences among London's ceremonial magicians, focusing on her training in the [[Hermetic Qabalah]], a "magical language" for exploring the otherworld. Adopting Luhrmann's concept of "[[interpretative drift]]", she relates how she shifted her understanding of events to make sense of her magical experiences. However, in contrast to Luhrmann's emphasis on how practitioners overcame their initial scepticism, Greenwood focuses on how these practitioners learn "the language of another mode of reality" through their experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 49&amp;ndash;82.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter four details Greenwood's early involvement in Wicca, through three separate covens. Offering her thoughts on Wiccan invocations, she then discusses the faith's approach to sexual polarity, pointing to the sexual underpinnings of the [[Great Rite]] and the [[Gnostic Mass]] as evidence. The chapter is rounded off with an explanation of how Wicca understands the natural world and a comparison between the religion and ceremonial magic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 83&amp;ndash;115.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paganavebury.jpg|thumb|left|Greenwood's work is based upon her fieldwork within the practicing Pagan community.]]

Chapter five examines the attraction of magic for its practitioners, and its uses for [[psychotherapy]] and [[healing]]. Greenwood explores the ways in which occultists use magic as a rebellion against [[Christianity]], and their construction of a "magical identity", believing this to be "organized around a deep internal exploration of the self through an interaction with the otherworld". She also looks at magic and the acquisition of [[power (philosophy)|power]], and the sense of empowerment discovered by magicians who were former abuse victims.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 117&amp;ndash;149.&lt;/ref&gt; The sixth chapter focuses on notions of [[gender]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], highlighting the widespread belief that sexual energy provides the power behind magic and discussing the contrasting views of [[Dion Fortune]] and [[Aleister Crowley]] on this issue; the former emphasised harmony and balance between "masculine" and "feminine" magical forces, while the latter advocated "magical anarchy" or spiritual autonomy for each individual, irrespective of gender. Greenwood looks at contrasting views on these issues in High Magic (ceremonial magic), Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft. Drawing upon the typologies advocated by sociologist of religion [[Susan J. Palmer]], she argues that High Magic emphasises "sex polarity", a situation in which men and women are seen as unequal and different, whereas Wicca holds to a position of "sex complementarity", in which men and women are seen as different yet equal, and Feminist Witchcraft advocates "sex unity", in which there is a tolerance of sexual ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 151&amp;ndash;177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter seven deals with conceptions of [[morality]] and [[ethics]], arguing that whereas High Magic typically envisions a [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] world view of [[Good and evil|good versus evil]], Wicca adheres to a [[monism|monistic]] worldview in which malevolence and benevolence are seen as intrinsic parts of the whole. Disagreeing with Luhrmann's view that morality's place in the occult is to hide the [[pseudoscience|pseudo-scientific]] nature of magic, Greenwood discusses how magic and witchcraft developed in Europe as a part of moral discourse. She looks at the internal source of morality in High Magic, explaining concepts such as that of the [[Qliphoth]], before examining the internal source of morality in Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 179&amp;ndash;208.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central arguments==
Greenwood states that western esotericists have a [[holism|holistic]], [[animism|animistic]] view of [[cosmology]], considering the universe to be alive and interconnected with [[Energy (esotericism)|spiritual energies]]. According to such beliefs, many of these energies operate in "a time and space distinct from, but also very closely connected to, everyday reality", and it is this area that is termed the "otherworld" in Pagan discourse.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 23"&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; She relates that western esotericists believe in forces who inhabit this otherworld, and who are personalized as deities, animal guides, or spirit beings.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 23"/&gt; She furthermore states that these individuals see themselves as [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]]s of the universal [[macrocosm]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 23"/&gt;

Greenwood highlights the practitioners' belief that they can interact with this otherworld and the entities which inhabit it through rituals that facilitate their own [[altered states of consciousness]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 23"/&gt; She notes that western magicians make use of [[mythology]] as a form of "cognitive map" to "structure their otherworldy experience".&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 24"&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; She also notes that this otherworld is closely linked to [[dream]]s and the [[imagination]] in western magical belief.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2000 25-26"&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 25&amp;ndash;26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenwood argues that the academic discipline of [[anthropology]], being a product of the western [[rationalism]] developed during the [[Age of Enlightenment]], is innately skeptical of claims for the existence of magic or an otherworld, either among non-western cultures or western subcultures. In contrast to this attitude, she notes that anthropology is the discipline which first pointed out that "reality is culturally constructed" and that there are "multiple ways of experiencing the world", including those which conceive of an otherworld existing alongside our own reality. For this reason, she argues that anthropologists wishing to understand a society that believes in and practices magic must first tentatively accept the existence of an otherworld, claiming that "it is inappropriate to use methods developed for the study of everyday reality to analyse the magical otherworld."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. pp. 23&amp;ndash;24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and recognition==

===Academic===
Greenwood's text was reviewed by Patric V. Giesler of [[Gustavus Adolphus College]] for peer-reviewed academic journal ''[[American Ethnologist]]''. Giesler describes Greenwood's work as "provocative", noting that it represents a "native's account" of Paganism, with Greenwood being "a native gone anthropologist." He characterises Greenwood's experiences as religious or spiritual rather than magical, because none of the practices that she described involved manipulating beings or forces for an instrumental end; the classic definition of magic. Unconvinced by her argument that practitioner's notions of identity, gender and morality derived from their encounter with the otherworld, he considers other sources for such notions, but otherwise recommended the book.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gie02|Giesler 2002]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was also reviewed by religious studies scholar [[Michael York (religious studies scholar)|Michael York]] of [[Bath Spa University]] for the ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]''. Labelling it an "enormously engaging, provocative, and rich book", he notes that readers may wish that Greenwood had more explicitly presented "the antipatriarchal assumptions and their shortcomings" of Feminist Witchcraft. Comparing it with Luhrmann's ''Persuasions of the Witch's Craft'', York comments that it is a "discerningly astute, nonretreating, thoroughly enjoyable, and highly recommended work."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yor01|York 2001]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah M. Pike of the [[California State University, Chico]] reviewed the book for ''Culture and Religion: An Interdisciplinary Journal'', describing it as an "accessible and personal account". Believing that it made an "important contribution" to Pagan studies and the anthropological study of magic, she nevertheless thought that Greenwood's subjective attitude was the book's shortcoming as well as its strength. Pike finds problems in Greenwood's insider-outsider status, believing that it has not been sufficiently theorised, and that Greenwood was unaware of her own bias in favour of Feminist Witchcraft, which in turn affects her interpretation of other forms of Wicca and ceremonial magic. She also critiques the book's lack of commentary or detailed analysis, complaining that many subsections lack conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pik02|Pike 2002]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist Galina Lindquist of the [[University of Stockholm]] published a review in ''[[The Australian Journal of Anthropology]]'', referring to ''Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld'' as "a welcome contribution" containing "valuable" [[ethnographic]] material. Noting that it joins the work of anthropologists like [[Jeanne Favret-Saada]], [[Paul Stoller]], and E. Turner, Lindquist praises the manner in which Greenwood put contemporary practices into historical perspective, and how she illuminates the "strains and contradictions" within the magical milieu. She believes that Greenwood's arguments would have been strengthened had she made use of a more in-depth ethnographic study of magical morality, and considers it unfortunate that Greenwood had not touched on [[ritual studies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lin02|Lindquist 2002]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pagan and esoteric community===
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|bgcolor=#ACE1AF|quote="This is one of the most stimulating and rewarding ethnographies of contemporary Witchcraft I've read. Greenwood has worked hard, and it shows in the quality of her findings and analysis. Her
writing is clear, insightful, and draws on a sophisticated theoretical framework. She describes herself as a communicator between
the worlds of academia and magical counterculture. She is clearly widely read both in the academic literature and the magical texts, more than competent in both worlds, and skilled at revealing one to the other."|source=—Reviewer Douglas Ezzy, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ezz01|Ezzy 2001]]. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; }}
Greenwood's work was independently reviewed by two separate individuals in ''[[The Pomegranate (journal)|The Pomegranate: A New Journal of Neopagan Thought]]'' &amp;ndash; then a scholarly but not yet academic publication. The first reviewer, Daniel Cohen of ''Wood and Water'' magazine, praises Greenwood's theoretical approach, claiming that she had been "braver" than Luhrmann in maintaining a "creative tension" as both an insider and outsider. Asserting that Greenwood's use of anthropological terminology made for "hard reading", he suspects that her use of the word "magician" would jar with many Pagans who would disagree with the manner in which she used it. In conclusion, he recommends it as a "valuable but inexpensive book".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Coh01|Cohen 2001]].&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Pomegranate'''s second review came from Pagan studies scholar Douglas Ezzy of the [[University of Tasmania]], who praises Greenwood's research, theoretical approach and style of writing. He notes that her "truly ground breaking" approach in taking spiritual experiences seriously had "fascinated and thrilled" him, asserting that her work builds on the pioneering edited collection ''Being Changed'' by Jean-Guy Goulet and David E. Young. Noting that ''Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld'' was "sometimes provocative", he disagrees with some of Greenwood's conclusions, but highlights that her arguments had made him think about these issues "in much sharper focus."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ezz01|Ezzy 2001]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing it for his own website, prominent chaos magician [[Phil Hine]] described Greenwood's work as "fascinating", arguing that it should interest students of anthropology as well as practising occultists. He praises the author's descriptions of her own experiences within esoteric groups, and the manner in which she highlighted the power struggles that take place within them, before recommending it as "an engaging and thought-provoking read".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hin|Hine n.d.]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:World population growth rates 1800-2005.png|thumb|300px|A chart of estimated annual growth rates in world population, 1800–2005. Rates before 1950 are annualized historical estimates from the [https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/worldhis.html US Census Bureau]. Red = USCB projections to 2025]]

A '''Malthusian catastrophe''' (also known as '''Malthusian check''', '''Malthusian spectre''' or '''Malthusian crunch''') is a prediction that [[population growth]] will outpace [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[Production (economics)|production]] – that there will be too many people and not enough food.

==Thomas Malthus==
In 1779, [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Thomas Malthus]] wrote:

{{quote|Famine seems to be the last, the most dreadful resource of nature. The power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man, that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race. The vices of mankind are active and able ministers of depopulation. They are the precursors in the great army of destruction, and often finish the dreadful work themselves. But should they fail in this war of extermination, sickly seasons, epidemics, pestilence, and plague advance in terrific array, and sweep off their thousands and tens of thousands. Should success be still incomplete, gigantic inevitable famine stalks in the rear, and with one mighty blow levels the population with the food of the world.|Thomas Malthus, 1798. ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]''. Chapter VII, p. 61&lt;ref name="Oxford World's Classics reprint"&gt;Oxford World's Classics reprint&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Notwithstanding the apocalyptic image conveyed by this particular paragraph, Malthus himself did not subscribe to the notion that mankind was fated for a "catastrophe" due to population overshooting resources. Rather, he believed that population growth was generally restricted by available resources:
[[File:Malthus PL en.svg|thumb]]
{{quote|The passion between the sexes has appeared in every age to be so nearly the same that it may always be considered, in algebraic language, as a given quantity. The great law of necessity which prevents population from increasing in any country beyond the food which it can either produce or acquire, is a law so open to our view...that we cannot for a moment doubt it. The different modes which nature takes to prevent or repress a redundant population do not appear, indeed, to us so certain and regular, but though we cannot always predict the mode we may with certainty predict the fact.|Thomas Malthus, 1798. ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]''. Chapter IV.}}

== Preventive vs. positive ==
Malthus proposed two kinds of population checks: preventive and positive.

A preventive check is a conscious decision to delay marriage or abstain from procreation based on a lack of resources.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esp.org/books/malthus/population/malthus.pdf|title=An Essay on The Principle of Population|last=Malthus|first=Thomas Robert|date=1798|website=Electronic Scholarly Publishing Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of check is unique to humanity, because it requires foresight.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Malthus argued that man is incapable of ignoring the consequences of uncontrolled population growth, and would intentionally avoid contributing to it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Malthus, a positive check is any event or circumstance that shortens the human life span. The primary examples of this are [[war]], [[epidemic|plague]] and [[famine]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, poor health and economic conditions are also considered instances of positive checks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simkins|first=Charles|date=2001|title=Can South Africa Avoid a Malthusian Positive Check?|jstor=20027682|journal=Daedalus|volume=130|issue=1|pages=123–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], [[mechanized agriculture]] produced a dramatic increase in productivity of agriculture and the [[Green Revolution]] greatly increased crop yields, expanding the world's food supply while lowering food prices.  In response, the growth rate of the world's population accelerated rapidly, resulting in predictions by [[Paul R. Ehrlich]], Simon Hopkins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Hopkins|first = Simon|title = A Systematic Foray into the Future|publisher = Barker Books|year = 1966|pages = 513–69}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and many others of an imminent Malthusian catastrophe.  However, populations of most developed countries grew slowly enough to be outpaced by gains in productivity.

By the early 21st century, many technologically developed countries had passed through the [[demographic transition]], a complex social development encompassing a drop in [[total fertility rate]]s in response to various [[fertility factor (demography)|fertility factors]], including lower [[infant mortality]], increased [[urbanization]], and a wider availability of effective [[birth control]].

On the assumption that the [[demographic transition]] is now spreading from the developed countries to [[less developed countries]], the [[United Nations Population Fund]] estimates that human population may peak in the late 21st century rather than continue to grow until it has exhausted available resources.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf|title=2004 UN Population Projections, 2004.|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:World-Population-1800-2100.svg|thumb|250px|World population from 1800 to 2100, based on [https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf UN 2004 projections] (red, orange, green) and [https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/worldhis.html US Census Bureau historical estimates] (black)]]
[[Image:Food production per capita.svg|thumb|250px|Growth in food production has been greater than population growth. Food per person increased since 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Data source: http://faostat3.fao.org/download/Q/QI/E, see graph metadata for further details.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Historians have estimated the total human population back to 10,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/worldhis.html|title=Historical Estimates of World Population, U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2006.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013110506/http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/worldhis.html|archivedate=2013-10-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure on the right shows the trend of total population from 1800 to 2005, and from there in three projections out to 2100 (low, medium, and high).&lt;ref name="UN"/&gt; The United Nations population projections out to 2100 (the red, orange, and green lines) show a possible peak in the world's population occurring by 2040 in the first scenario, and by 2100 in the second scenario, and never ending growth in the third.

The graph of annual growth rates (at the top of the page) does not appear exactly as one would expect for long-term exponential growth.  For exponential growth it should be a straight line at constant height, whereas in fact the graph from 1800 to 2005 is dominated by an enormous hump that began about 1920, peaked in the mid-1960s, and has been steadily eroding away for the last 40 years. The sharp fluctuation between 1959 and 1960 was due to the combined effects of the [[Great Leap Forward]] and a natural disaster in China.&lt;ref name="USCB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/|title=International Data Base}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also visible on this graph are the effects of the [[Great Depression]], the two world wars, and possibly also the [[1918 flu pandemic]].

Short-term trends, even on the scale of decades or centuries, cannot prove or disprove the existence of mechanisms promoting a Malthusian catastrophe over longer periods. However, due to the prosperity of a major fraction of the human population at the beginning of the 21st century, and the debatability{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} of the predictions for [[ecological collapse]] made by [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] in the 1960s and 1970s, some people, such as economist [[Julian Lincoln Simon|Julian L. Simon]], question its inevitability.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Julian L, "[http://www.juliansimon.org/writings/Articles/REVOLUTI.txt More People, Greater Wealth, More Resources, Healthier Environment]", ''Economic Affairs: J. Inst. Econ. Affairs'', April 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 study by a group of prominent economists and ecologists, including [[Kenneth Arrow]] and Paul Ehrlich&lt;ref&gt;Arrow, K., P. Dasgupta, L. Goulder, G. Daily, P. Ehrlich, G. Heal, S. Levin, K. Mäler, S. Schneider, D. Starrett and B. Walker, "Are We Consuming Too Much" ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', 18(3), 147–72, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the central concerns regarding sustainability have shifted from population growth to the consumption/savings ratio, due to shifts in population growth rates since the 1970s.  Empirical estimates show that public policy (taxes or the establishment of more complete property rights) can promote more efficient consumption and investment that are sustainable in an ecological sense; that is, given the current (relatively low) population growth rate, the Malthusian catastrophe can be avoided by either a shift in consumer preferences or public policy that induces a similar shift.

A 2002 study&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/english/newsroom/news/2002/7828-en.html World agriculture 2030: Global food production will exceed population growth] August 20, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization|UN Food and Agriculture Organization]] predicts that world food production will be in excess of the needs of the human population by the year 2030; however, that source also states that hundreds of millions will remain hungry (presumably due to economic realities and political issues).

==Criticism==

[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] argued that Malthus failed to recognize a crucial difference between humans and other species. In capitalist societies, as Engels put it, scientific and technological "progress is as unlimited and at least as rapid as that of population".&lt;ref&gt;Engels, Friedrich."Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy", ''Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher'', 1844, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx argued, even more broadly, that the growth of both a human population ''in toto'' and the "[[relative surplus population]]" within it, occurred in direct proportion to [[Capital accumulation|accumulation]].&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx (transl. Ben Fowkes), ''Capital Volume 1'', Harmondsworth, Penguin, 1976 (originally 1867),  pp. 782–802.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry George]] criticized Malthus's view that population growth was a cause of poverty, arguing that poverty was caused by the concentration of ownership of land and natural resources. George noted that humans are distinct from other species, because unlike most species humans can use their minds to leverage the reproductive forces of nature to their advantage. He wrote, "Both the jayhawk and the man eat chickens; but the more jayhawks, the fewer chickens, while the more men, the more chickens." &lt;ref&gt;Progress and Poverty, Chapter 7, Malthus vs. Facts in http://www.henrygeorge.org/pchp7.htm&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=October 2016}}

[[Ester Boserup]] suggested that population levels determined agricultural methods, rather than agricultural methods determining population.&lt;ref&gt;Ester Boserup, ''The Conditions of Agricultural Growth: The Economics of Agrarian Change under Population Pressure''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=October 2016}}

[[Julian Lincoln Simon|Julian Simon]] was another economist who argued that there could be no global Malthusian catastrophe, because of two factors: (1) the existence of new knowledge, and educated people to take advantage of it, and (2) "economic freedom", that is, the ability of the world to increase production when there is a profitable opportunity to do so.&lt;ref&gt;The Ultimate Resource II: People, Materials, and Environment in http://www.juliansimon.com/writings/Ultimate_Resource/&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=October 2016}}

D.E.C. Eversley observed that Malthus appeared unaware of the extent of industrialization, and either ignored or discredited the possibility that it could improve living conditions of the poorer classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1287575|title=Social theories of fertility and the Malthusian debate|last=Charles.|first=Eversley, David Edward|date=1959|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=|isbn=9780837176284|location=Westport, Conn.|pages=|oclc=1287575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to these criticisms, some individuals, such as [[Joseph Tainter]], argue that science has diminishing marginal returns&lt;ref&gt;Tainter, Joseph: ''The Collapse of Complex Societies'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=October 2016}} and that scientific progress is becoming more difficult, harder to achieve, and more costly.

The '''Thomas Henry Pentland Molson Prize''' for the Arts is awarded by The [[Canada Council]] for the Arts. Two prizes are awarded annually to distinguished individuals. One prize is awarded in the arts, one in the social sciences and humanities. The prizes are $50,000 each, and intended to encourage continuing contribution to the cultural and intellectual heritage of Canada.

==Endowment==
Funded by an endowment from the Molson Foundation, the prizes are administered by the Canada Council for the Arts in cooperation with the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada]]. Laureates are chosen by a peer assessment committee appointed jointly by the Canada Council and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.

==Eligibility==
Candidates must be Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Canada. To be nominated, candidates must have made a substantial and distinguished contribution over a significant period of time. In the words of the deed of gift, the prizes are intended "to encourage Canadians of outstanding achievement in the fields of the [[Arts]], the [[Humanities]] or the [[Social science|Social Sciences]] to make further contribution to the cultural or intellectual heritage of Canada". The terms of reference are interpreted as follows:
*outstanding achievement must have already been amply demonstrated
*further contribution implies that the laureates should still be very active and productive. 

In other words, the prize is not intended as an "end of service" reward or as recognition for one great accomplishment. Past assessment committees have been quite consistent in choosing laureates who are close to the top of an outstanding career. Corporations and other organizations are excluded from consideration, as are posthumous awards. No individual may be awarded the prize more than once. The prizes are accessible to qualified persons from Aboriginal Peoples and diverse cultural and regional communities. Members of the board of the Canada Council for the Arts and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council are not eligible to be considered for this prize during the course of their terms as members nor for six months following the end of their term.

==Nomination process==
Candidates may not apply for the Canada Council for the Arts Molson Prizes on their own behalf. They must be nominated by three individuals or three organizations, or a combination of individuals and organizations. Nominations are sought from persons and organizations that have the interest and capacity to nominate appropriate individuals. Nominators may submit one letter signed by the three nominating individuals or organizations, or submit three separate letters of nomination. Nominators are responsible for gathering and providing relevant documentation to the Canada Council.

==Selection procedure==
The two laureates are chosen by a single, multidisciplinary peer assessment committee co-chaired by the Chairman of the Canada Council for the Arts and the President of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. Members are chosen to ensure fair representation of gender, the two official languages, the various regions and cultures of Canada, and the various types of artistic and scholarly disciplines. Committee members are among the most accomplished individuals in their respective fields and, ideally, have interests that extend beyond the confines of a single discipline.

'''''Parable of the Sower''''' is a science fiction novel by American writer [[Octavia E. Butler]], the first in a two-book series. It was published in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Octavia E. Butler, Science Fiction Writer, Dies at 58|author=Fox, Margalit|date=March 1, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/01/books/01butler.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Set in the 2020s where society has largely collapsed due to climate change, growing wealth inequality, and corporate greed, ''Parable of the Sower'' centers on a young woman named Lauren Oya Olamina who possesses what Butler dubbed hyperempathy or "sharing" – the ability to feel pain and other sensations she witnesses. As a teenager growing up in the remnants of a [[gated community]] near Los Angeles, she begins to develop a new belief system, which she comes to call Earthseed. When the community's security is compromised, her home is destroyed and her family is murdered, and she travels north with other survivors. Society outside the community walls has reverted to chaos due to resource scarcity and poverty, and mixed race relationships are stigmatized amid attacks against religious and ethnic minorities. Lauren believes that humankind's destiny is to travel beyond Earth and live on other planets, forcing humankind into its adulthood, and that Earthseed is preparation for this destiny. She gathers followers along her journey north and founds the first Earthseed community, Acorn, in Northern California.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Proposed third ''Parable'' novel==
Butler had planned to write a third ''Parable'' novel, tentatively titled ''Parable of the Trickster'', which would have focused on the community's struggle to survive on a new planet. She began this novel after finishing ''[[Parable of the Talents (novel)|Parable of the Talents]]'', and mentioned her work on it in a number of interviews, but at some point encountered [[writer's block]]. She eventually shifted her creative attention, resulting in ''[[Fledgling (novel)|Fledgling]]'', her final novel. The various false starts for the novel can now be found among Butler's papers at the [[Huntington Library]], as described in an article at the ''Los Angeles Review of Books''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lareviewofbooks.org/essay/theres-nothing-new-sun-new-suns-recovering-octavia-e-butlers-lost-parables | title="There's Nothing New / Under The Sun, / But There Are New Suns": Recovering Octavia E.

==Adaptations==

''Parable of the Sower'' was adapted as ''Parable of the Sower: The Concert Version'', a work-in-progress opera written by American folk/blues musician [[Toshi Reagon]] in collaboration with her mother, singer and composer [[Bernice Johnson Reagon]]. The adaptation's libretto and musical score combine African-American [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[rock and roll]], and [[folk music]] into rounds to be performed by singers sitting in a circle. It was performed as part of [[The Public Theater]]'s [[Under the Radar Festival]] in New York City in 2015&lt;ref&gt;Moon, Grace.

==In popular culture==
''Parable of the Sower'' was referred to in hip-hop artist [[Talib Kweli]]'s song "Ms. Hill" off his mixtape ''[[Right About Now: The Official Sucka Free Mix CD]]''. In the song, which is about [[Lauryn Hill]], Kweli references how Lauryn Hill used to come into [[Nkiru]] (a bookstore Kweli owns in [[Brooklyn]], New York) and liked to buy [[Octavia Butler]] books, namely ''Parable of the Sower''.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} "We used to chill at Nkiru / her moms was a customer / she used to love to buy the books by Octavia Butler / Parable of the Sower, the main character's name was Lauren".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ms. Hill|work=Anysonglyrics.com|url=http://www.anysonglyrics.com/lyrics/t/talib/Ms-Hill-Lyrics.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Lauren Beukes]]' 2013 novel ''[[The Shining Girls]]'', the body of one of the victims, Jin-Sook Au, a social worker, is found with a copy of ''Parable of the Sower''.

Part of the central verse of [[Earthseed]], "All that you touch you change, all that you change changes you", is included in track 2 and 6 of Sugar Candy Mountain's album ''666''.

The work of hip hop/R&amp;B duo [[THEESatisfaction]] was influenced by Octavia Butler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://fryemuseum.org/blog/?p=845#more |title=Attention Earthlings! |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher =|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third track from their 2012 album ''[[awE NaturalE]]'', "Earthseed", contains themes from the ''Parable'' series: "Change there are few words / That you can say / We all watch things morphing everyday."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://genius.com/Theesatisfaction-earthseed-lyrics| title=Earthseed - lyrics |last=| first=| date=| website=| publisher=| access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jalbert2 01.jpg|thumb|200 px|Illustrations from Jalbert's 1966 patent, showing the keels and the airfoil shape.]][[Image:X-38 Ship -2 Landing on Lakebed EC99-45080-101-EDIT1.jpg|thumb|200 px|The [[NASA X-38]] prototype makes a gentle lakebed landing at the end of a July 1999 test flight at the Dryden Flight Research Center.]]

A '''parafoil''' is a nonrigid ([[textile]]) [[airfoil]] with an aerodynamic cell structure which is inflated by the wind. Ram-air inflation forces the parafoil into a classic [[wing]] cross-section. Parafoils are most commonly constructed out of [[ripstop nylon]].

The device was developed in 1964 by [[Domina Jalbert]] (1904–1991). Jalbert had a history of designing kites and was involved in the development of hybrid balloon-kite aerial platforms for carrying scientific instruments. He envisaged the parafoil would be used to suspend an aerial platform or for the recovery of space equipment. A patent was granted in 1966.  

Deployment shock prevented the parafoil's immediate acceptance as a [[parachute]]. It was not until the addition of a '''drag canopy''' on the riser lines (known as a "[[Slider (parachuting)|slider]]") which slowed their spread that the parafoil became a suitable parachute. Compared to a simple [[Parachute#Round|round]] [[Canopy (parachute)|canopy]], a parafoil parachute has greater steerability, will glide further and allows greater control of the rate of descent; the parachute format is mechanically a [[Hang gliding|hang glider]] of the free-flight [[Kite types|kite type]] and such aspects spawned [[Paragliding|paraglider]] use. 

The air flow into the parafoil is coming more from below than the flight path might suggest, so the frontmost ropes tow against the airflow. When gliding, the angle of attack is lowered and the airflow meets the parafoil head on. This makes it difficult to achieve an optimum gliding angle without the parafoil deflating.

In 1984 Jalbert was awarded the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI) Gold Parachuting Medal for inventing the parafoil.

Parafoils see wide use in a variety of [[windsport]]s such as [[kite flying]], [[powered parachute]]s, [[paragliding]], [[kitesurfing]], [[speed flying]], [[wingsuit flying]] and [[skydiving]]. The [[Peter Lynn|world's largest kite]] is a parafoil-variant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4287">The '''Remote Activation Munition System (RAMS)''' is a radio frequency controlled system that is used to remotely detonate demolition charges or remotely operate electronic equipment such as beacons, laser markers, and radios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/105th-congress/senate-report/189/1|title=Department of Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 Report|last=|first=|date=May 11, 1998|work=Committee on Armed Services|access-date=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by a team of researchers led by James Chopak at the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|Army Research Laboratory]] over the span of four years starting in 1996 and ending in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bdo14krj6oMC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=%22army+research%22+Remote+activation+Munitions+System&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZYRGdzEDed&amp;sig=7a_OfeROuJx-VWiCIu114Br5MRw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjf1dnonvTbAhVprlkKHccwD3s4ChDoAQgoMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22army%20research%22%20Remote%20activation%20Munitions%20System&amp;f=false|title=U.S. Special Operations Forces: 1996 Posture Statement|last=Holmes|first=H.

The RAMS was designed to serve as a more portable and convenient alternative to conventional remote activation systems like the model XM-122, which was considered too big, heavy, and fragile for efficient use. In addition, the XM-122 was limited in its range (about 1km) and relied on very large high capacity batteries. In contrast, the RAMS weighed only a couple pounds and its microprocessor-based transmitter was powered by at most seven standard 9-volt batteries. The device was capable of reaching a range up to 2 kilometers, and the combination of the crystal filter in the receivers and the FM detector circuit made it possible to maintain high signal sensitivity at a low power consumption rate. In addition, the RAMS was operational in harsh environments with temperatures as low as -25 degrees F and as high as 140 degrees F. It was also capable of functioning when submerged in saltwater, up to depths of 66 feet.&lt;ref&gt;Andrejkovics, R., Chopack, J., Brann, H., Hopkins, John, Tobin, R., &amp; Fraser, W. (2003). ''[https://patents.google.com/patent/US6546873B1/en United States Patent No. US 6,546,873 B1]''. Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; However, testing performed by the Army Research Laboratory have found that due to the low power levels of the RAMS receiver’s electrical signals output, the system has demonstrated a noticeable level of unreliability in performance past a certain distance.&lt;ref&gt;Land, D.G. (2008). ''[https://patents.google.com/patent/US7451700 United States Patent No. US 7,451,700 B1]''. Waltham, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

More modern versions of the RAMS can weigh as little as three powers and can reach a range of more than 5 kilometers, allowing operators to stand farther away from the blast at a safer distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.army.mil/article/92437/new_system_untethers_soldiers_from_demo_charge|title=New system untethers Soldiers from demo charge|last=Buckley|first=Melissa|date=December 6, 2012|work=U.S. Army|access-date=2018-07-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Russell Sage Foundation''' is an American philanthropic [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]] that primarily funds research relating to income inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Callahan|first1=David|title=Inside the Russell Sage Foundation's Epic Dig Into Why Inequality Matters|url=http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2015/4/14/inside-the-russell-sage-foundations-epic-dig-into-why-inequa.html|accessdate=15 June 2016|publisher=Inside Philanthropy|date=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located in New York City, it is a research center and a funding source for studies by scholars at other academic and research institutions. The foundation also publishes, under its own imprint, the books that derive from the work of its grantees and visiting scholars. The foundation focuses on [[Labour economics|labor markets]], [[immigration]] and [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], and [[social inequality]] in the United States, as well as [[behavioral economics]].

The Russell Sage Foundation was established in 1907 for "the improvement of social and living conditions in the United States" by a gift of $10 million from [[Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage]] (1828–1918), widow of railroad magnate and financier [[Russell Sage]].&lt;ref name="Olivia Sage"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://diglib.auburn.edu/collections/sage/essays.html | title=Margaret Olivia Slocum (Mrs. Russell) Sage (1828-1918): Founder of the Russell Sage Foundation | last= | first= | date= | website=Auburn University Libraries | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Sage directed the foundation to pursue its mission through a broad set of activities, including "research, publication, education, the establishment and maintenance of charitable or benevolent activities, agencies and institutions, and the aid of any such activities, agencies, or institutions already in existence."&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/about/history | title=History of the Russell Sage Foundation | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;Glenn et al. (1947), p.xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early years===
Soon after its establishment, the Foundation played a pioneering role in dealing with problems of the poor and the elderly, in efforts to improve hospital and prison conditions, and in the development of social work as a profession.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Wenocur and Michael Reisch, From Charity to Enterprise: The Development of American Social Work in a Market Economy  (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation was also responsible for early reforms in [[health care]], [[city planning]], [[consumer]] [[Credit (finance)|credit]], [[labor law]], the training of nurses, and [[social security]] programs.&lt;ref name="A Brief History"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/sites/all/files/u4/Brief%20History%20of%20RSF.pdf | title=Celebrating 100 Years | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=June 2016}}
 
In 1907, the foundation funded the [[Pittsburgh Survey]],&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Survey"&gt;"The Pittsburgh Survey," by Paul Kellogg in "Charities and the Commons" 1909&lt;/ref&gt; the first systematic effort to survey working class conditions in a large U.S. city. Considered a major [[Progressive Era]] achievement, the findings inspired labor reforms and helped end twelve-hour days and seven-day weeks for steel workers.&lt;ref name="Chronicle"&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1909 and 1922, the Foundation spent nearly a sixth of its capital to build [[Forest Hills Gardens]], a model suburban community for working families designed by architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. The aim was to demonstrate the economic and social viability of an intelligently planned suburban community.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn et al. (1947), p.49&lt;/ref&gt; The first lots sold for $800, and a new suburb began thriving by 1917, but housing prices soon soared beyond the range of the families they were intended for.&lt;ref name="A Brief History" /&gt;

In 1922, the Foundation helped launch the [[Regional Plan Association]] to research, write and publish a plan to guide the future development of the New York metropolitan region.  In its first 40 years, the Foundation spent more than $1 million on the Regional Survey and Plan. Researchers completed 12 massive volumes as part of the effort, with the first being published in 1928-29.&lt;ref name="Regional Plan"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Harold |editor1-last=Keele |others=Joseph C. Kiger |title=Foundations |edition=1984 |year=1984 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn. |page=376 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The RPA was not opposed to the growth of the area and its population, but believed that for the development to be efficient and orderly, it had to be properly managed; only in this way could businesses continue to grow and the city maintain its global impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite unbound|pages=187-88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation also provided support for [[social feminist]]s such as [[Mary van Kleeck]], founder of the [[International Institute of Industrial Relations]].&lt;ref name=Alvon&gt;{{cite book|first1=Guy|author1=Alvon|editor1-last=Nelson|editor1-first=Daniel|title=A Mental Revolution: Scientific Management since Taylor|date=1992|publisher=Ohio State University Press|location=Columbus Ohio|url=https://ohiostatepress.org/Books/Complete%20PDFs/Nelson%20Mental/06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1945–1980===
Since [[World War II]], the Foundation has devoted its efforts to strengthening the social sciences as a means of achieving more informed and rational social policy. It launched a variety of programs to draw the social sciences closer to decision-makers in other professions, from policymakers to health care providers. This initiative included funds for research on "social indicators", a collection of data that measure the quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Social Indicators Research|"Social indicators"]] on the Russell Sage Foundation website&lt;/ref&gt;

([[Mary Van Kleek]], who headed the foundation in the late 1940s, was a member of the [[American Labor Party]] and served on a committee for the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] in 1948.&lt;ref name=Withering&gt;

In the 1950s, the Foundation supported research on the practice and aims of [[philanthropy]]. It established the [[Foundation Center]], a non-profit that maintains data on organized philanthropy. It was also the first to publish ''The Foundation Directory'', a comprehensive listing of the nation’s several thousand largest foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fconline.foundationcenter.org/ | title=90% of U.S. Foundations don't have websites | last= | first= | date= | website=Foundation Directory Online | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this decade, the foundation also received money from the Ford Foundation ($554,000) for the "practical utilization of the behavioral sciences".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ford Foundation Annual Report|last=|first=|publisher=The Ford Foundation|year=1957|isbn=|location=|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, the Foundation turned to [[medical ethics]], including [[patients' rights]], extreme measures to sustain life, and the use of human subjects in research. Foundation-supported books from this period include Bernard Barber’s ''Drugs and Society'' (1967) and ''The Dying Patient'' (1970).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.russellsage.org/publications/dying-patient|title=The Dying Patient {{!}} Russell Sage Foundation|website=www.russellsage.org|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s – present===
The Foundation was an early force in the development of [[behavioral economics]],&lt;ref name="B.E. paper"&gt;{{Citation

In 1993, the Foundation also established the Behavioral Economics Roundtable,&lt;ref name=BE /&gt; a group of behavioral economists elected by grantees in the program and charged to design initiatives to advance the field. Three charter members of the Roundtable subsequently received the Noble Prize in economics: [[George Akerlof]], [[Daniel Kahneman]], and [[Thomas Schelling]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The Foundation launched new programs to study immigration, the rise of economic inequality and contact among cultures within the American population. Between 1992 and 2000, the Foundation worked with the [[Ford Foundation]] to conduct a Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/research/multi-city-study-urban-inequality | title=Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Foundation partnered with the [[Population Reference Bureau]] (PRB) to produce ''The American People: Census 2000'', edited by Reynolds Farley of the University of Michigan and John Haaga of PRB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/publications/american-people | title=The American People | last=Farley | first=Reynolds | date= September 2005 | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the Foundation partnered with the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] on an initiative exploring the social, economic and political effects of the [[Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.russellsage.org/research/co-funded-projects|title=Co-Funded Research {{!}} Russell Sage Foundation|website=www.russellsage.org|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2015, the Foundation launched ''RSF: The Russell Sage Foundation Journal of the Social Sciences'', a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]], [[Open access|open-access]] journal of social science research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsfjournal.org/|title=RSF Journal|website=www.rsfjournal.org|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current activities==

===Research===
The Foundation currently pursues four principal programs:
* A program of research on the Future of Work concerned principally with the causes and consequences of changes in the quality of [[low-wage work]] in the United States and other advanced economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/research/future-work | title=Future of Work | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A program of research on Race, Ethnicity, and Immigration concerned with the social, economic, and political effects of the changing racial and ethnic composition of the U.S. population, including the transformation of communities and ideas about what it means to be American. This program was formed to replace two prior programs, Immigration and Cultural Contact, in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/research/race-ethnicity-immigration | title=Race, Ethnicity, and Immigration | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A program on Social Inequality, focused on the social effects of rising economic inequality, with particular attention to the ways in which the U.S. political and educational systems have responded to growing economic disparities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/research/social-inequality | title=Social Inequality | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A program of research on Behavioral Economics which incorporates the insights of psychology and other social sciences into the study of economic behavior.&lt;ref name=BE /&gt;

The principal programs feature a number of working groups:
*The Biology and Social Science Working Group examines how the incorporation of biological concepts, processes and measures in social science research might improve our understanding of a range of social and economic outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/research/working-groups/biology-and-social-science | title=Biology and Social Science (BioSS) Working Group | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Racial Bias in Policing Working Group examines the impact of racial, ethnic, and gender-based attitudes on law enforcement. The group is working with metropolitan police departments across the U.S. to develop policies to reduce racial bias in law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/research/working-groups/rsf-working-group-racial-bias-policing | title=Racial Bias in Policing Working Group | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Cultural Contact and Immigration Working Group examines immigrant life outside of customary gateway cities such as New York, Miami, or Los Angeles, with an emphasis on the cultural frictions resulting from the rapid growth of the foreign-born population in the United States at a time of high economic uncertainty and political polarization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/awarded-project/working-group-cultural-contact-and-immigration | title=Working Group on Cultural Contact and Immigration | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the activities sponsored under its main programs, the Foundation also currently supports a special initiative on the social, economic and political effects of the [[Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/special-initiatives/affordable-care-act | title=The Social, Economic and Political Effects of the Affordable Care Act | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:ASA conference 2008 - 07.JPG|thumb|267px|2008 conference booth]]

===Books===
The Foundation publishes books on a variety of subjects, with particular emphasis on work related to its programs. Notable recent publications include ''Punishment and Inequality in America'' by [[Bruce Western]], winner of the 2007 Albert J. Reiss, Jr. Distinguished Scholarship Award and the 2008 Michael J. Hindelang Book Award from the [[American Society of Criminology]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.russellsage.org/publications/punishment-and-inequality-america-0|title=Punishment and Inequality in America {{!}} Russell Sage Foundation|website=www.russellsage.org|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Long Shadow: Family Background, Disadvantaged Urban Youth, and the Transition to Adulthood'', for which authors Karl Alexander, Doris Entwisle, and Linda Olson won the 2016 [[Grawemeyer Award]] in Education;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grawemeyer.org/alexander-olson-and-entwisle-win-education-award-for-the-long-shadow/|title=Grawemeyer Awards {{!}}   Alexander, Entwisle and Olson win education award for "The Long Shadow"|website=grawemeyer.org|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The American Non-Dilemma'' by Nancy DiTomaso, winner of the 2013 [[C.

The Foundation is also the publisher of the [[American Sociological Association]]’s distinguished Rose Series in Sociology.

The Foundation's publications are distributed by the [[Chicago Distribution Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Publishers served by the Chicago Distribution Center| work = University of Chicago Press| accessdate = 2017-09-12| url = http://press.uchicago.edu/cdc/publishers.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visiting Scholars and Journalists programs===
The Russell Sage Foundation has established a center where Visiting Scholars can pursue their writing and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/about/what-we-do/visiting-scholars-program | title=Visiting Scholars Program | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, the Foundation invites a number of scholars to its New York City headquarters to investigate topics in social and behavioral sciences. The Foundation particularly welcomes groups of scholars who wish to collaborate on a specific project during their residence at Russell Sage. Typically Visiting Scholars work on projects related to the Foundation’s current programs.

In 2015 the Foundation established a Visiting Journalists program to support journalists undertaking original research on social, political, and economic conditions in the United States. 

====Robert K. Merton Scholar====
* In 1990, [[Robert K. Merton]] became the first Foundation Scholar at Russell Sage, recognizing his long and invaluable service as an adviser to the administration and a mentor to other visiting scholars.
* In 2000, [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel]]ist [[Robert M. Solow]] became the second Foundation Scholar, following Merton’s retirement. In 2003, the position was renamed the Merton Scholar.

==Headquarters buildings==

When the Foundation was formed, it attempted to locate its offices in the [[United Charities Building]] on [[Park Avenue South]] and East 22nd Street in [[Manhattan]], but was unable to do so as the building was fully rented; instead, the new foundation spread out to a number of locations in the area. In 1912, Margaret Sage and [[Robert W. DeForest]] decided to construct a headquarters building for the Foundation which would also serve as a memorial to her late husband. They engaged [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] architect [[Grosvenor Atterbury]], who had designed the [[Forest Hills Gardens]] model housing project for the Foundation in 1908, to design the building, and purchased property at 120 [[22nd Street (Manhattan)|East 22nd Street]] at the corner of [[Lexington Avenue]], just down the street from both United Charities Building and the [[Church Missions House]] of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], and a short block from [[Gramercy Park]]. The building, which was originally nine stories before a penthouse was added in the 1920s, was constructed between 1912 and 1913 and altered in 1922-1923.  A fifteen-story extension on East 22nd, which Atterbury also designed, connected to the original building with a five-story "hyphen", was added between 1930 and 1931.&lt;ref name=gna&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.preserve2.org/gramercy/proposes/ext/ension/122_130e22.htm | title=Proposed Historic District Extension | last= | first= | date=31 August 1998 | website=Preserve &amp; Protect | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 5-story connector building was necessitated by a covenant to the deed for the site, which was sold to the Foundation by the [[Gramercy Park Hotel]].  The intention was to preserve access to sunlight for the hotel's north-facing rooms.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Russell Sage Foundation Headquarters.jpg|thumb|right|210px|The Foundation's current headquarters]]

Atterbury's design took the form of a [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance]] [[Florence|Florentine]] [[palazzo]]. Because it was both headquarters for the Foundation and a physical memorial for Sage, the building was more opulently constructed than would generally be the case for a charity.  Atterbury utilized expensive materials in the interior, such as rare Kingwood [[sandstone]] in the elevators.&lt;ref name=gna /&gt; The 1922-1923 alteration added second floor sculptural panels by [[Rene Paul Chambellan]] illustrating the foundation's ideals, goals and deeds.&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;

The Foundation made available space in the main building, at no charge, to other social-service organizations, such as the Family Welfare Association of America, the American Association of Social Workers and the Library of Social Work, which took up the top two floors of the main building. Space in the 22nd Street extension was rented out, and the New York School of Social Work was the primary tenant.&lt;ref name=gna /&gt;

The Foundation sold the building in 1949 to the [[Archdiocese of New York]] which used it as the headquarters of [[Catholic Charities]], and it was sold again in 1975, after which it was converted to apartments; it is now called '''Sage House'''.&lt;ref name=gna /&gt;  The building was designated a [[List of New York City Landmarks|New York City landmark]] in 2000,&lt;ref name=nycland&gt;{{cite nycland}}, p.86&lt;/ref&gt; and is part of a proposed extension to the [[Gramercy Park Historic District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.preserve2.org/gramercy/proposes/ext/ension.htm | title=Proposed Gramercy Park Historic District Extension | last= | first= | date=31 August 1998 | website=Preserve &amp; Protect | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1981, the Foundation has been headquartered in a [[Philip Johnson]]-designed [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] building at 112 [[64th Street (Manhattan)|East 64th Street]] between [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park]] and [[Lexington Avenue (Manhattan)|Lexington]] Avenues, built in 1958-1960 for the [[Asia Society]] and [[Japan Society (Manhattan)|Japan Society]]. The building is located in the [[Upper East Side Historic District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite nycland}}, p.155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AIA4}}, p.391&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://blog.nus.edu.sg/sdwa Singapore-Delft Water Alliance (SDWA)] was a multi-national, interdisciplinary research Centre of Excellence for Water Knowledge involving [[w:Public Utilities Board, Singapore|PUB (Singapore)]], [[w:National University of Singapore|National University of Singapore]] and [https://www.deltares.nl/en/ Deltares], established through an initiative of the [[w:Prime Minister's Office (Singapore)#National Research Foundation|National Research Foundation in Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;Tan. T.     (2007, Feb. 17). Dutch Water Expertise for Singapore. The Straits Times, Science&lt;/ref&gt; SDWA was hosted by National University of Singapore and provided a research home to scientists and engineers from all partner organizations. SDWA ceased to exist on the 1st of April 2014 after it successfully met all its Key Performance Indicators. The collaboration between NUS and Deltares is continued through [http://www.nusdeltares.org NUSDeltares].

== History ==
As part of [[w:Singapore|Singapore's]] push to be a Global Hydrohub, a memorandum of understanding was signed in 2006 &lt;ref&gt;(2006, Jun. 27). MOU for water knowledge signed, The Business Times.&lt;/ref&gt; between NUS, PUB and Delft Hydraulics to create a center of excellence for water knowledge at NUS . This MoU resulted in the creation of  SDWA which was officially launched in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Chow P.N.(2007, Feb.   8). Singapore as a hydrohub.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Focus ==
SDWA's research focus was within the following six disciplines:
* [[hydrodynamics]]
* [[hydrology]]
* [[morphodynamics]]
* [[water quality]] and [[ecology]]
* [[policy analysis]]
* [[hydroinformatics]]

==Projects==
SDWA's [https://web.archive.org/web/20101122233248/http://www.sdwa.nus.edu.sg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=38&amp;Itemid=116 research projects] were interdisciplinary. The major ongoing research projects were:
* MHBox: This project focused on understanding and developing a pre-operational forecasting system for residual currents and water levels.&lt;ref&gt;Tan. T. (2007, Feb. 17). Systems to forecast tides and currents. The Straits Times, Science.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Peatland: Peatlands store a large fraction of the world's carbon resources. However the most rapid peatland degradation currently occurs in Southeast Asia. The aims of this project were to support large-scale implementation of mitigative water management and improved spatial planning of production and conservation areas in peatlands.
* ASC Pandan: This project aimed to understand the fundamental processes and interactions in an urban water system to be able to develop adequate and cost-effective water improvement measures&lt;ref&gt;(2007, Feb. 17). Taking water management strategies a step further. The Straits Times, Science.&lt;/ref&gt; through the creation of an Aquatic Science Center in Pandan Canal.&lt;ref&gt;(2008, July 3). Aquatic Science Centre to open along Ulu Pandan Canal. The Straits Times, Home, p10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newshub.nus.edu.sg/headlines/0708/asc_3jul08.php Aquatic Science Centre in Pandan]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mangroves: This project looked in several aspects of mangoves, such as rates of sediment capture and erosion, and dispersion of seeds. The research is continued at the [http://www.themangrovelab.com/ Mangrove Lab].&lt;ref&gt;Tan. T. (2007, Feb. 17). Harnessing plant power to absorb tidal waves. The Straits Times, Science.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Seagrass Project: This project aimed to improve understanding of the natural dynamics of seagrass ecosystems in tropical coastal waters in response to environmental variability in turbidity and sedimentation.
* Sediment Project: The project 'Large Scale Sediment Transport and Turbidity in Singapore's Coastal Waters' aimed to determine the processes responsible for the increased turbidity by identification of a sediment budget of the Singapore coastal waters, including the main sources and sinks (and the changes thereof) and of the dominant sediment transport mechanisms.
* Upper Peirce: The SDWA Upper Peirce research programme was focussed on gaining better insights into the hydrological, hydrodynamic, chemical, biological and biochemical processes of tropical reservoirs through experimental work, modelling, and advanced and innovative monitoring.
* Multi-Reservoir: The Multi-Objective Multiple-Reservoir Management project aimed at developing tools and methods for maximising catchment yield and satisfying pre-set water quality standards, while at the same time ensure flood protection for reservoir systems.

SDWA also carried out several large research projects for Singapore agencies such as the Public Utilities Board and National Environmental Agency.

== Education ==
SDWA considered that strong research capabilities and activities are essential to education and training. As such students and course participants were exposed to mature reflections on the results generated through the research projects in which SDWA members were involved, and also to results from research done elsewhere.

As part of this approach SDWA was spearheading a new double M.Sc. degree program in Hydraulic Engineering and Water Resources Management in collaboration between the National University of Singapore and the Delft University of Technology. The programme is based on an institutionally innovative concept under which students spend one year of study in both Singapore and The Netherlands and receive separate M.Sc. degrees from both Universities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13055">A '''software map''' represents static, dynamic, and evolutionary information of [[software system]]s and their [[software development process]]es by means of 2D or 3D map-oriented [[information visualization]]. It constitutes a fundamental concept and tool in [[software visualization]], [[software analytics]], and [[software diagnosis]]. Its primary applications include risk analysis for and monitoring of [[code quality]], team activity, or software development progress &lt;ref&gt;Monitoring Code Quality and Development Activity by Software Maps Johannes Bohnet and Döllner, Jürgen. In: Proceedings of the IEEE ACM ICSE Workshop on Managing Technical Debt, pp. 9-16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and, generally, improving effectiveness of software engineering with respect to all related artifacts, processes, and stakeholders throughout the [[software engineering]] process and [[software maintenance]].

== Motivation and concepts ==
Software maps are applied in the context of [[software engineering]]: Complex, long-term [[software development]] projects are commonly faced by manifold difficulties such as the friction between completing system features and, at the same time, obtaining a high degree of [[code quality]] and [[software quality]] to ensure [[software maintenance]] of the system in the future. 
In particular, "Maintaining complex software systems tends to be costly because developers spend a significant part of their time with trying to understand the system’s structure and behavior."&lt;ref&gt;J. Bohnet: ''Visualization of Execution Traces and its Application to Software Maintenance''. PhD thesis, Hasso-Plattner-Institut, University of Potsdam, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The key idea of software maps is to cope with that challenge and optimization problems by providing effective communication means to close the communication gap among the various stakeholders and information domains within software development projects and obtaining insights in the sense of [[information visualization]].

Software maps take advantage of well-defined cartographic [[map]] techniques using the virtual [[3D city models|3D city model]] metaphor&lt;ref&gt;R. Wettel, M. Lanza: ''Visualizing Software Systems as Cities''. 4th IEEE international Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; to express the underlying complex, abstract information space. The metaphor is required "since software has no physical shape, there is no natural mapping of software to a two-dimensional space".&lt;ref&gt;A. Kuhn , P. Loretan , O. Nierstrasz: ''Consistent Layout for Thematic Software Maps'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Software maps are non-spatial [[map]]s that have to convert the hierarchy data and its attributes into a spatial representation.

== Applications ==
Software maps generally allow for comprehensible and effective communication of course, risks, and costs of software development projects to various stakeholders such as management and development teams. 
They communicate the status of applications and systems currently being developed or further developed to project leaders and management at a glance. "A key aspect for this decision making is that software maps provide the structural context required for correct interpretation of these performance indicators".&lt;ref&gt;''D. Limberger et al.: ''Interactive Software Maps for Web-Based Source Code Analysis''. Proceedings of the International Web3D Conference, ACM, pp. 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; As an instrument of communication, software maps act as open, transparent information spaces which enable priorities of code quality and the creation of new functions to be balanced against one another and to decide upon and implement necessary measures to improve the [[software development process]].

For example, they facilitate decisions as to where in the code an increase of quality would be beneficial both for speeding up current development activities and for reducing risks of future maintenance problems.

Due to their high degree of expressiveness (e.g., information density) and their instantaneous, automated generation, the maps additionally serve to reflect the current status of system and development processes, bridging an essential information gap between management and development teams, improve awareness about the status, and serve as early risk detection instrument.

== Contents ==
Software maps are based on objective information as determined by the [[KPI driven code analysis]] as well as by imported information from [[software repository]] systems, information from the [[source code]]s, or [[software development tool]]s and [[programming tool]]s. In particular, software maps are not bound to a specific [[programming language]], [[modeling language]], or [[software development process]] model.

Software maps use the hierarchy of the software implementation artifacts such as [[source code]] files as base to build a [[tree mapping]], i.e., a rectangular area that represents the whole hierarchy, subdividing the area into rectangular sub-areas. A software map, informally speaking, looks similar to a virtual [[3D city model]], whereby artifacts of the software system appear as virtual, rectangular 3D buildings or towers, which are placed according to their position in the software implementation hierarchy.

Software maps can express and combine information about software development, software quality, and system dynamics by mapping that information onto visual variables&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://innovis.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/innovis/uploads/Publications/Publications/Carpendale_visual_variables.pdf |title=Considering Visual Variables as a Basis for Information Visualization}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the tree map elements such as footprint size, height, color or texture. They can systematically be specified, automatically generated, and organized by templates.

== Mapping software system example ==
Software maps "combine thematic information about software development processes (evolution), software quality, structure, and dynamics and display that information in a cartographic manner".&lt;ref&gt;Jonas Trümper, Jürgen Döllner: ''Extending Recommendation Systems with Software Maps''. Proceedings of the 3rd International ICSE Workshop on Recommendation Systems for Software Engineering (RSSE), IEEE Computer Society, pp. 92-96, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; For example: 
* The height of a virtual building can be proportional to the complexity of the code unit (e.g., single or combined [[software metric]]s).
* The ground area of a virtual 3D building can be proportional to the number of lines of code in the module or (e.g., non-comment lines-of-code NCLOC).
* The color can express the current development status, i.e., how many developers are changing/editing the code unit.

With this exemplary configuration, the software map shows crucial points in the source code with relations to aspects of the software development process. For example, it becomes obvious at a glance what to change in order to:
* implement changes quickly;
* evaluate quickly the impact of changes in one place on functionality elsewhere;
* reduce entanglements that lead to uncontrolled processes in the application;
* find errors faster;
* discover and eliminate bad programming style.

Software maps represent key tools in the scope of automated software diagnosis [http://www.softwarediagnostics.com software diagnostics].

== As business intelligence tools and recommendation systems ==
Software maps can be used, in particular, as analysis and presentation tool of [[business intelligence]] systems, specialized in the analysis of software related data. Furthermore, software maps "serve as recommendation systems for software engineering".&lt;ref&gt;Jonas Trümper, Jürgen Döllner: ''Extending Recommendation Systems with Software Maps''. Proceedings of the 3rd International ICSE Workshop on Recommendation Systems for Software Engineering (RSSE), IEEE Computer Society, pp. 92-96, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Software maps are not limited by software-related information: They can include any hierarchical system information as well, for example, maintenance information about complex technical artifacts.

== Visualization techniques ==
Software maps are investigated in the domain of [[software visualization]]. The visualization of software maps is commonly based on [[tree mapping]], "a space-filling approach to the visualization of hierarchical information structures"&lt;ref&gt;B. Johnson, B. Sneiderman: ''Tree-maps: a space-filling approach to the visualization of hierarchical information structures''. Proc. of IEEE VIS, 284–291, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; or other hierarchy mapping approaches.

=== Layout algorithms ===
To construct software maps, different layout approaches are used to generate the basic spatial mapping of components such as: 
* Tree-map algorithms that initially map the software hierarchy into a recursively nested rectangular area.
* Voronoi-map algorithms that initially map the software hierarchy by generating a [[Voronoi diagram|Voronoi]] map.

=== Layout stability ===
The spatial arrangement computed by layouts such as defined by tree maps strictly depends on the hierarchy. If software maps have to be generated frequently for an evolving or changing system, the usability of software maps is affected by non-stable layouts, that is, minor changes to the hierarchy may cause significant changes to the layout.

In contrast to regular Voronoi treemap algorithms, which do not provide deterministic layouts, layout algorithm for Voronoi treemaps can be extended to provides a high degree of layout similarity for varying hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;S. Schmechel et al.: ''Visualization of Varying Hierarchies by Stable Layout of Voronoi Treemaps''. Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Information Visualization Theory and Applications (IVAPP 2014), SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, pp. 50-58, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar approaches exist for the tree-map based case.

== History ==
Software maps methods and techniques belong the scientific displine of [[Software visualization]] and [[information visualization]]. They form a key concept and technique within the fields of [[software diagnosis]]. They have applications also in [[software mining]] and [[software analytics]]. Software maps have been extensively developed and researched by, e.g., at the [[Hasso Plattner Institute]] for IT systems engineering, in particular for large-scale, complex IT systems and applications.

'''Street theatre''' is a form of [[theatre|theatrical]] [[performance]] and presentation in outdoor [[public space]]s without a specific paying audience. These spaces can be anywhere, including [[Shopping mall|shopping centres]], [[Parking lot|car parks]], recreational reserves, college or university campus and street corners. They are especially seen in outdoor spaces where there are large numbers of people. The actors who perform street theatre range from [[busking|busker]]s to organised theatre companies or groups that want to experiment with performance spaces, or to promote their mainstream work. It was a source of providing information to people when there were no sources of providing information like television, radio etc. Nowadays, street play is used to convey a message to the crowd watching it.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2011/08/street-plays-a-means-of-spreading-awareness/&lt;/ref&gt; Street play is considered to be the rawest form of acting, because one does not have a microphone or loud speakers.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Sometimes performers are commissioned, especially for street [[festival]]s, children's shows or [[parade]]s, but more often street theatre performers are unpaid or gather some income through the dropping of a coin in a hat by the audience.

The logistics of doing street theatre necessitate simple [[costume]]s and [[Theatrical property|prop]]s, and often there is little or no [[Electronic amplifier|amplification]] of sound, with actors depending on their natural [[human voice|vocal]] and physical ability. This issue with sound has meant that [[physical theatre]], including dance, [[mime artist|mime]] and [[slapstick]], is a very popular genre in an outdoor setting. The performances need to be highly visible, loud and simple to follow in order to attract a crowd.

Street theatre should be distinguished from other more formal outdoor theatrical performances, such as performances in a park or garden, where there is a discrete space set aside (or [[rope]]d off) and a [[Ticket (admission)|ticketed]] audience.

In some cases, street theatre performers have to get a [[licence]] or specific permission through [[local government|local]] or [[State (subnational)|state]] [[government]]s in order to perform. Many performers travel internationally&lt;ref&gt;[http://performers.net/ International list of performers]&lt;/ref&gt; to certain locations of note.

Street theatre is arguably the oldest form of theatre in existence: most mainstream entertainment mediums can be traced back to origins in street performing, including religious [[passion plays]] and many other forms. More recently performers who, a hundred years ago, would have made their living working in [[variety theatre]]s, [[music hall]]s and in [[vaudeville]], now often perform professionally in the many well-known street performance areas throughout the world. Notable performers that began their careers as street theatre performers include [[Robin Williams]],&lt;ref&gt;Robin Williams began his career on the streets of San Francisco as a street performer: https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800013042/bio&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Bowie]], [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]] and [[Harry Anderson]].

Street theatre allows people who might not have ever been to, or been able to afford to go to, traditional theatre. The audience is made up of anyone and everyone who wants to watch and for most performances is free entertainment.

==Reasons for staging work on the street==

Performance artists with an interest in social activism may choose to stage their work on the street as a means of directly confronting or engaging the public. For example, multimedia artist Caeser Pink and his group of performers known as The Imperial Orgy staged a piece titled ''Our Daily Bread''&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/CaeserPinkOurDailyBread-OrgyStreetTheateronWallStreet Archive Video]&lt;/ref&gt; that brought performers onto the streets of the New York's financial district to ceremoniously lay loaves of [[Wonder Bread]] along the sidewalks, each with an advertisement from Satan offering to buy people's souls in exchange for material possessions. The performance caused an uproar when police were called out and bomb-sniffing dogs were brought in to inspect the loaves of bread for explosives.

Other artists consider a paying, theatre-going public to be unrepresentative of the public to whom they are trying to communicate, and performing to 'the man on the street' may be considered a more democratic form of dissemination.

Some contemporary street theatre practitioners have extensively studied pre-existing street and popular theatre traditions, such as [[Carnival]], [[commedia dell'arte]] etc. and wish to present them in a situation close to their original context.

Whatever the reason for choosing the street, the street is a place with a different set of possibilities than the conventional theatre space. Sue Gill of [[Welfare State International]] argues that a street theatre performance is not a lesser form than an indoor performance, nor is it simply taking what you do on stage and placing it outdoors, but a form with an energy and an integrity of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | editor-last = Coult | editor-first = Tony | editor2-last = Kershaw | editor2-first = Baz | title = Engineers of the Imagination: The Welfare State Handbook | publisher = Methuen | year = 1983 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oPkCAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=engineers+of+the+imagination&amp;dq=engineers+of+the+imagination&amp;pgis=1 | isbn = 0-413-52800-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PSI India street play.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A street play (''nukkad natak'') in [[Dharavi]] slums in Mumbai]].
Many companies are politically motivated and use street theatre to combine performance with protest. This has occurred through the [[guerrilla theatre]] of [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Doyle | first = Michael William | title = Imagine Nation: The American Counterculture of the '60s and '70s | publisher = Routeledge | year = 2001 | url = http://www.diggers.org/guerrilla_theater.htm | isbn = 0-415-93040-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Living Theatre]], the carnivalesque parades of [[Bread and Puppet Theatre]], and the work of [[Ashesh Malla]] and the Sarwanam Theatre Group of [[Nepal]].

A character-based street theatre which developed in the 1960s and 1970s was developed by groups like Lumiere and Son, John Bull Puncture Repair Kit, Exploded Eye and Natural Theatre Company. The performances were unannounced and featured characters who acted out a pre-arranged scenario, looking beautiful or surreal or simply just involving passers by in conversation. They did not seek to trick in a ''[[Candid Camera]]'' way, but rather invited the audience to pretend along with them. No amount of planning or rehearsal could dictate what would happen.

Another example would be Natural Theatre's Pink Suitcase scenario. A number of smartly dressed people carrying bright pink suitcases enter a set of streets or buildings. They search for and miss their companions. In their search they get on buses, hail cabs, end up in shop windows, etc. By the time they meet up at a pre-arranged spot with the help of passers-by, perceptions of the area have changed and shopping has ceased for at least a few moments. The humour is universal and this piece has been seen in nearly seventy countries. It is usually performed by four or five actors, but has been done with twenty-five.

Particularly in the field of [[electrical engineering]], it has numerous correlations with the engineering sciences. However, the perspective of technical informatics is not marked by the technical disciplines alone but the focus is rather on giving special emphasis to typical aspects of informatics in order to find more general and universal solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-office.fh-koeln.de/english/faculties/overview/f10/courses/u/01602.php Technical Informatics (diploma) description]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has since been adopted as the name of numerous groups, schools, and businesses.

==Architecture and planning==
A group of architects, landscape architects, and urban planners from the [[Bay Area]], founded in late 1939 through the merging of two groups of [[architects]], one from [[San Francisco]] and the other from the [[University of California]], Berkeley, called themselves Telesis. Philosophically, the group also evolved from several larger international architectural movements, which included CIAM ([[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]]) and MARS ([[MARS Group|Modern Architectural Research Group]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Serge Chermayeff|Chermayeff, Serge]], "Telesis: The Birth of a Group." ''New Pencil Points'' (July 1942), pp.&amp;nbsp;45&amp;ndash;48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their stated aim was to research the development and implications of what architectural critic [[Lewis Mumford]] called the Second Bay Area Regional Style. As set forth in their founding statement, the group believed that "People and the Land make up the environment which has four distinct parts--a place to Live, Work, Play, and the Services which integrate these and make them operate. These components must be integrated in the community and urban region through rational planning, and through the use of modern building technology."—from ''The Things Telesis Has Found Important''

Noted Telesis members included [[William Wurster]], [[Catherine Bauer Wurster]], [[Vernon DeMars]], [[Thomas Dolliver Church|Thomas Church]], [[Garrett Eckbo]], [[Grace Morley|Grace McCann Morley]], [[Geraldine Scott|Geraldine Knight Scott]], [[Joseph Allen Stein]], Jack Hillmer, Francis Violich, and T. J. Kent, Jr. In addition to internal research and [[working group]]s that investigated such topics as speculative housing, industrial design, and the relationship of the physical environment of the San Francisco Bay Area to indigenous architectural styles, the group also organized several influential exhibitions on contemporary architecture and planning with the support of the San Francisco Museum of Art. Professional and personal papers from many of Telesis's members are collected in the [http://www.ced.berkeley.edu/cedarchives/ Environmental Design Archives] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

==Sociology==

The mechanics of society fall under two general groups: social statics and social dynamics. Social dynamics is further divided into social genesis and social telesis. Social telesis may be further divided into individual telesis and collective telesis.&lt;ref&gt;Outlines of Sociology, Lester F. Ward, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Telesis: Progress consciously planned and produced by intelligently directed effort.&lt;ref&gt;L. F. Ward, Outlines of Sociol., p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Social telesis: The intelligent direction of social activity towards the achievement of a desired and understood end.&lt;ref name="WardOutlines"&gt;L. F. Ward, Outlines of Sociol., p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Collective telesis: Adaptation of means to ends by society.&lt;ref&gt;L. F. Ward, Outlines of SocioL, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Individual telesis: The conscious adaptation of conduct by an individual to the achievement of his own consciously apprehended ends.&lt;ref name="WardOutlines" /&gt;

==Philosophy==

Telesis (Greek: Telos, end, + -osis, condition), defined as "the intelligent direction of effort toward the achievement of an end.", has also been a term used in the context of [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]] to refer to "infocognitive potential", a concept originating from [[Christopher Langan]] and his theory of everything, the CTMU.  In his 2002 paper on the CTMU, Langan defines telesis in the following passage:&lt;ref&gt;Langan, C.M. 2002. [http://www.megafoundation.org/CTMU/Articles/Langan_CTMU_092902.pdf] ''The Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe: A New Kind of Reality Theory'' pg. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Laws do not stand on their own, but must be defined with respect to the objects and attributes on which they act and which they accept as parameters. Similarly, objects and attributes do not stand on their own, but must be defined with respect to the rules of structure, organization and transformation that govern them. It follows that the active medium of cross-definition possesses logical primacy over laws and arguments alike, and is thus pre-informational and pre-nomological in nature…i.e., telic. Telesis, which can be characterized as “infocognitive potential”, is the primordial active medium from which laws and their arguments and parameters emerge by mutual refinement or telic recursion.}}

'''''The Faith of Our Fathers: a Plain Exposition and Vindication of the Church Founded by Our Lord Jesus Christ''''' is a book by archbishop [[James Gibbons]] which was published in Baltimore in 1876,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=0pM77M1OrkrTDGast4&amp;id=uIVNCtk5bSwC&amp;pg=PA3 The Faith of Our Fathers]''&lt;/ref&gt; which became a best-selling conversion manual in the [[United States]] and by 1980 was in its 111th printing. 

In his 1917 preface to the 83rd edition, the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] noted that "since the first edition appeared, in 1876 up to the present time, fourteen hundred thousand copies have been published and the circulation of the book is constantly increasing. The work has been translated into nearly all the [[languages of Europe]]." The well-known agnostic, literary critic and fellow Baltimorean [[H. L. Mencken]] wrote, in his survey of religion ''Treatise on the Gods'', that "the best exposition of [[Catholic]] doctrine is probably ''The Faith of our Fathers''', by the late Cardinal Gibbons."

'''''The Music of Francis Poulenc (1899–1963): A Catalogue''''', abbreviated '''FP''', is a chronological catalogue of [[Francis Poulenc]]'s works which was published by Carl B. Schmidt in 1995. Schmidt provides for each known composition, which includes unfinished, unpublished and lost works, a detailed history of composition and performance, and lists manuscripts and publications.{{sfn|Schmidt|1995}}

As a pianist, Poulenc composed many pieces for his own instrument in [[List of solo piano compositions by Francis Poulenc|his piano music]] and [[chamber music]]. He wrote works for orchestra including several [[concerto]]s, also three [[opera]]s, two [[ballet]]s, [[incidental music]] for plays and [[film music]]. He composed songs (''mélodies''), often on texts by contemporary authors. His religious music includes the [[Mass (Poulenc)|Mass]] in G major, the [[Stabat Mater (Poulenc)|Stabat Mater]] and [[Gloria (Poulenc)|Gloria]].

== Overview ==
The composer had written a catalogue of his works in 1921, which is reproduced in Schmidt's book.{{sfn|Schmidt|1995|p=xxi}} According to this list, the first noted piece was in 1914 ''Processional pour la crémation d'un mandarin'' for piano, now lost or destroyed. Poulenc completed his last work, his [[Oboe Sonata (Poulenc)|Oboe Sonata]], in 1962.

'''Piano, chamber music and songs'''

As a professional pianist, Poulenc wrote many pieces for his own instrument. He was a prolific writer of works of [[chamber music]], often with piano, and some works for two pianos. Poulenc composed many songs (''mélodies''), most of them accompanied by piano, but some also in versions with a small instrumental ensembles, for example his ''[[Rapsodie nègre]]'' for baritone, flute, clarinet, string quartet and piano. He composed easily for woodwind instruments, scoring for example a [[Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano|piano trio with oboe and bassoon]] instead of the traditional violin and cello. Poulenc was less familiar with string instruments. The cellist [[Pierre Fournier]] helped him to write the [[Cello Sonata (Poulenc)|Cello Sonata]], which he premiered with the composer as the pianist.{{sfn|Prieto|2006}} Poulenc destroyed all sketches for string quartets and three for violin sonatas, while only the [[Violin Sonata (Poulenc)|fourth one]] survived, but was received critically.{{sfn|Hell|1978|p=180}}

'''Orchestra and stage'''

Among his works with orchestra are three [[opera]]s, two [[ballet]], [[incidental music]] for plays, [[film music]] and concertos, some with unusual solo instruments such as [[harpsichord]] and [[Organ (music)|organ]]. The harpsichordist [[Wanda Landowska]] inspired the composition of the [[Concert champêtre]].{{sfn|Ivry|1996}}

'''Collaboration in the group ''Les Six'''''

Poulenc was a member of the group of composers ''[[Les Six]]'', with [[Georges Auric]], [[Louis Durey]], [[Arthur Honegger]], [[Darius Milhaud]] and [[Germaine Tailleferre]], and contributed to their collective productions, which included another ballet.{{sfn|Bialek|2012}}

'''Sacred music and choral music'''

Poulenc turned to writing also religious music in the 1930s, composing a [[Mass (Poulenc)|Mass]] in G major for [[a cappella]] choir. He composed the [[Stabat Mater (Poulenc)|Stabat Mater]] in 1950 in memory of the painter [[Christian Bérard]] in 1950. The late [[Gloria (Poulenc)|Gloria]] for soprano, choir and orchestra became one of his best-known works.{{sfn|Hyperion|2016}}{{sfn|Clements|2008}} He drew inspiration for his sacred compositions mostly from liturgical texts.

''' Songs '''

For his songs and [[song cycle]]s, he often collaborated with contemporary poets, setting poems by writers such as [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Louis Aragon]], [[Paul Éluard]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Pierre de Ronsard|Ronsard]] and [[Louise de Vilmorin]], whom he mentioned in titles. He further set poems by [[Louis Aragon]], [[Théodore de Banville]], [[Maurice Carême]], [[Colette]], [[Robert Desnos]], [[Maurice Fombeure]], [[Marie Laurencin]], [[Madeleine Ley]], [[François de Malherbe]], [[Jean Moréas]], [[Jean Nohain]] and [[Paul Valéry]], among others. In 1943, during the occupation of France, a cantata ''[[Figure humaine]]'' on poems by Éluard which celebrate ''[[Liberté (poem)|Liberté]]''.{{sfn|Hell|1978|p=183}}

== Table of works ==

In the table, the works are initially listed by the FP number. Other information given is the French title, a translation if commonly used, the [[Key (music)|key]], the scoring if not clear from the title, the year(s) of composition, the genre, text information, notes and a free score when available, and the page number in the catalogue. Abbreviations used are "rev." for "revised", "orch." for "orchestrated" and "sc." for "score".{{sfn|Schmidt|1995}}

In ''Genre'', instrumental pieces are distinguished as ''orchestral'' and ''chamber'' music, particularly that for piano. The group of stage works contains operas, ballets and incidental music, while film scores are marked separately. Sacred and secular music for voice is divided in ''choral'', for [[cantata]]s and [[motet]]s, and ''vocal'', holding songs and song cycles.

'''The Primitive Hut''' is a concept that explores the origins of architecture and its practice. The concept explores the [[anthropological]] relationship between man and the natural environment as the fundamental basis for the creation of architecture. The idea of The Primitive Hut contends that the ideal architectural form embodies what is natural and intrinsic.

The Primitive hut as an architectural theory was brought to life over the mid-1700s till the mid-1800s, theorised in particular by ([[Abbot|''Abbé'']]) [[Marc-Antoine Laugier]]. Laugier provided an allegory of a man in nature and his need for shelter in ''An Essay on Architecture'' that formed an underlying structure and approach to architecture and its practice. This approach has been explored in architectural theory to speculate on a possible destination for architecture as a discipline.  The essay was arguably one of the first significant attempts to theorise architectural knowledge both scientifically and philosophically.  
                                                                
== Origins of The Primitive Hut: ''Essai sur L'Architecture'' (''Essay on Architecture),'' 1755 ==

''The Essay on Architecture'' was first published by Marc-Antoine Laugier in 1753. It was written in the [[Age of Enlightenment|age of enlightenment]], during a time characterised by rationalist thinking through science and reason. Architecture in France during this period was defined predominantly by the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style  with its excessive ornamentation and religious [[iconography]]. Rather than being concerned with the search for meaning and the over analysis of the [[Representation (arts)|representational elements]] of architecture, Laugier's essay proposed that the idea of noble and formal architecture was found in what was necessary for architecture, not in its ornamentation but in its [[Truth|true]] underlying fundamentals. Laugier argued for the simplicity of architecture, that architecture must return to its origins, the simple rustic hut.

It was through The Primitive Hut that Laugier sought to explain his philosophy of architecture. The ''Essay on Architecture'' provides what Laugier explains as the general rules of architecture: the 'true principles', the 'invariable rules'; for 'directing the judgement and forming the taste of the gentleman and the architect'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To Laugier, The Primitive Hut was the highest virtue that architecture should achieve.

=== The frontispiece illustration ===

An illustration of the primitive hut by [[Charles-Dominique-Joseph Eisen|Charles Dominique Eisen]] was the frontispiece for the second edition of Laugier's ''Essay on Architecture (1755)''. The frontispiece was arguably one of the most famous images in the history of architecture, it helped to make the essay more accessible and consequently it was more widely received by the public. The message the illustration was suggesting was clear; that the essay would suggest a new direction or a new order for architecture. In the image a young woman who personifies architecture draws the attention of an angelic child towards the primitive hut. Architecture is pointing to a new structural clarity found in nature, rather than the ironic ruins of the past.

=== Premise ===

''The Essay on Architecture'' provides a story of man in his 'primitive' state to explain how the creation of the "primitive man's" house is created instinctively based on mans need to shelter himself from nature. Laugier believed that the model of the primitive man's hut provided the ideal principles for architecture or any structure. It was from this perspective that Laugier formed his general principles of architecture where he outlined the standard form of architecture and what he believed was fundamental to all architecture. To Laugier, the general principles of architecture were found in what was natural, intrinsic and part of natural processes.

=== Outline ===

Laugier's ''Essay on Architecture'' is divided into six chapters that focus on the different constituencies and considerations of architecture.  It methodically identifies the key components of a building, describes their fundamental importance and how they should be approached.

In Chapter 1: "The General Principles of Architecture", Laugier divides and analyses buildings into five main "articles": the [[column]], [[entablature]], [[pediment]], the different [[storey]]s of architecture, the [[window]]s and [[door]]s. In Article 1, for example, Laugier makes four general rules for the construction of columns, one of them being that the column "must be strictly perpendicular, because being intended to support the whole load, perfect verticality gives it its greatest strength."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Essay on Architecture|last=Laugier|first=M. A.|publisher=T. Osbourne and Shipton|year=1755|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To Laugier, these articles emphasised the fundamental components of a building and what he identifies as their core necessities - that is, The Primitive Hut model. Laugier emphasised the point that nature provides the rules for architecture.

Laugier used the frontispiece to illustrate that typically architecture needs only three main elements, the free-standing columns, horizontal beams (entablature), and a simple pediment (the triangular end of a pitched roof).

Laugier also noted that the deviation or misuse of the principles lead to inherent faults in typical buildings and in architectural practice. In particular he recognised logical faults, issues such as proportion and unintelligent design. Instead, advocating that "by approaching the simplicity of the model, fundamental mistakes are avoided and true perfection achieved".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The idea also claims that Ancient Greek temples owed their form to the earliest habitations erected by man. In the primitive hut, the horizontal beam was supported by tree trunks planted upright in the ground and the roof was sloped to shed rainwater. This was an extension of the primitive hut concept and the inspiration behind the basic [[Doric order]].

The essay advocates that architecture approach perfection through the search for absolute beauty, specifically by returning to the hypothetical original hut as a model for building.

== Contribution to architectural theory ==

The Primitive Hut made an important contribution to the theory of architecture. It marked the beginning of a significant analysis and debate within architectural theory, particularly between [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] schools of thought. While previously the field of architecture concerned the search for the ideal building form through truth in building, the primitive hut questioned the universal in architecture. It was through the reading of the Laugier Essay questioned the fundamental and the universal requirements of architecture, the text marked a new field of inquiry into the field of architecture that changed the understandings and the approach to architecture. In particular, there were the beginnings of an attempt to understand the various individual components of architecture.

The Primitive Hut is an a-historical point of reference that is not necessarily a historical object that is investigated through speculation or an archaeological investigation. The Primitive Hut was instead a self-evident realisation that created a new perspective of architectural inquiry. Architectural inquiry would be engaged to justify the validity of the primitive hut model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hum.leiden.edu/lucas/legitimacy-of-architecture/project/the-primitive-hut.html|title=The Idea of the Primitive Hut|last=|first=|date=15 March 2013|website=The Legitimacy of Architecture 1750-1850|publisher=Universiteit Leiden|access-date=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of The Primitive Hut have conceptually been linked to the Old Testament and the story of [[Adam and Eve]], and of other primitive cultures. The classical orders in the stories about primitive dwellings are often the subject of analysis to trace the history of the primitive hut, these have arguably been traced back to the works of Vitruvius and [[De architectura|''The Ten Books on Architecture'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On Adams House in Paradise: The Idea of the Primitive Hut in Architectural History|last=Rykwert|first=Joseph|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|year=1972|isbn=0870705121|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These tracings work to validate The Primitive Hut model.

Scientific and philosophical approaches have led to various branches of inquiry that question both the origins and the possible destinations of architecture. These have been recognised across a range of different cultures. These different approaches have led to various conceptualisations that question cultural differences and attempt to define the ideal principles of architecture and of the primitive hut specifically.

The Primitive hut is a conceptual hut, that is not necessarily a material and physical hut. It is an abstract concept of a place that is created through mans response to the natural environment, where architecture acts as the mediator between man and nature. The Primitive hut concept explores how architecture came to be, and is a way of explaining the fundamental origins of architecture. The Primitive hut provides a point of reference for all speculation on the essentials of building and represents arguably the first architectural 'idea'.

The Primitive Hut concept also suggests that the natural environment provides the solutions for this ideal architectural form. Understandings of [[vernacular architecture]] have often had a major influence on the understandings of the Primitive Hut, as they often provide a different point of origin for a potential direction for architecture. Rather than focusing on the meanings that are associated with the building and its components, the Primitive Hut questions the fundamental components that are universal in architecture.

=== Themes ===

Theory surrounding The Primitive Hut covers a number of key themes:                                           
* To present rites where a "primitive hut" has either been built ritually and at seasonal intervals, or deliberately in a "primitive" state for analogous ritual purposes.                                                                       
* To show how the idea of the primitive hut became a vehicle for architectural theories from the fifteenth century on.                                                                        
* To suggest that the "primitive hut will retain its validity as a reminder of the original and therefore essential meaning of all building for people: that is, of architecture"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Germann|first=G|title=Review: On Adams House in Paradise; The Idea of the Primitive Hut in Architectural History by Joseph Rykwert|journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|volume=Vol. 33, No. 3, Oct., 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of primitive huts ==
The primitive hut has been theorised to have different forms:

In the theory of [[empirical knowledge]], '''the problem of the speckled hen''' is whether a single immediate [[observation]] of a [[wikt:speckle|speckle]]d [[chicken|hen]] provides a certain knowledge of the number of speckles observed. Clearly, this is not an isolated example, and therefore it is of fundamental nature.&lt;ref name=chis42&gt;[[Roderick Chisholm]], "The Problem of the Speckled Hen", ''Mind'' 51 (1942): pp.&amp;nbsp;368–373.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophically, this problem probes the limits of [[knowledge by acquaintance]]: one is unable to know with [[certainty]] the existence of determinate things in one's experience merely by the virtue of the experience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/certainty/ "Certainty"], ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roderick Chisholm]] attributes it to [[Gilbert Ryle]] suggesting to [[A. J. Ayer]].&lt;ref name=chis42/&gt; It is viewed as a critisicm of the view expressed by [[C. I. Lewis]] that there can never be "positive bafflement in the presence of the immediate, because there is here no question which fails to find an answer".&lt;ref&gt;C. I. Lewis, Mind and the World-Order, p. 128, As cited by Chisholm (1942). &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Heath]] remarks that this problem is one of the "descendants of [[Rene Descartes|Descartes]]'s '[[chiliagon]]' argument in the sixth of his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy|Meditations]]''". &lt;ref name=heath2008&gt;[[Joseph Heath]], ''Following the Rules: Practical Reasoning and Deontic Constraint'', Oxford: OUP, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;305, note&amp;nbsp;15).&lt;/ref&gt;

A. J. Ayer suggested that if we are unable to enumerate speckles accurately, then it is incorrect to suggest that the "sense-data" provides a definite number of speckles despite the fact that the hen does have a definite number of them, clearly outlined. In Ayers' words, speckles are enumerable only if in fact they have been enumerated. &lt;ref name=chis42/&gt;

A number of philosophers analyzed the merits of this proposition. Chisholm concludes that the problem of the speckled hen emphacises the fact that there are basic propositions ([[synthetic proposition]]s which do not refer beyond the content of the immediate experience) that are necessarily imprecise. &lt;ref name=chis42/&gt;

'''Transparent heating film''', also called '''transparent heating plastic''' or '''heating transparent polymer film''' is a thin and flexible [[polymer]] film with a [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductive]] [[optical coating]]. Transparent heating films may be rated at 2.5{{nbsp}}kW/m{{sup|2}}&lt;!-- see talk page --&gt; at voltages below 48 [[volt]]s [[direct current]] (V{{nbsp}}DC). This allows [[heating]] with secure [[transformer]]s delivering voltages which will not hurt the human body. Transparent conductive polymer films may be used for heating transparent glasses. A combination with [[LEDFilm|transparent SMD electronic]] for multipurpose applications, is also possible. It is also a variant of carbon [[heating film]].

'''Transport economics''' is a branch of economics founded in 1959 by American economist [[John R. Meyer]] that deals with the [[resource allocation|allocation of resources]] within the transport sector. It has strong links to civil engineering. Transport economics differs from some other branches of economics in that the assumption of a spaceless, instantaneous economy does not hold. People and goods flow over networks at certain speeds. its a Demands peak.  Advance ticket purchase is often induced by lower fares.  The networks themselves may or may not be competitive. A single trip (the final good, in the consumer's eyes) may require the bundling of services provided by several firms, agencies and modes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.civilengineerbuddy.com/transportation-economics-an-introduction-transportation-engineering/&lt;/ref&gt;

Although transport systems follow the same [[supply and demand]] theory as other industries, the complications of [[network effect]]s and choices between dissimilar goods (e.g. car and bus travel) make estimating the demand for transportation facilities difficult. The development of models to estimate the likely choices between the goods involved in transport decisions ([[discrete choice]] models) led to the development of an important branch of [[&lt;big&gt;economics]]


In transport, [[Demand (economics)|demand]] can be measured in number of journeys made or in total distance traveled across all journeys (e.g. [[passenger-kilometer]]s for public transport or vehicle-kilometers of travel (VKT) for [[private transport]]). [[Supply (economics)|Supply]] is considered to be a measure of capacity. The price of the good (travel) is measured using the [[generalised cost]] of travel, which includes both money and time expenditure.

The effect of increases in supply (i.e. capacity) are of particular interest in transport economics (see [[induced demand]]), as the potential environmental consequences are significant (see ''externalities'' below).

== Externalities ==
In addition to providing benefits to their users, transport networks impose both [[positive externalities|positive]] and [[negative externalities]] on non-users. The consideration of these externalities – particularly the negative ones – is a part of transport economics.

Positive externalities of transport networks may include the ability to provide [[emergency services]], increases in land value, and [[economies of agglomeration|agglomeration benefits]]. Negative externalities are wide-ranging and may include local air pollution, [[noise pollution]], [[light pollution]], [[traffic safety|safety hazards]], [[:wikt:severance|community severance]] and [[traffic congestion|congestion]]. The contribution of transport systems to potentially hazardous [[climate change]] is a significant negative externality which is difficult to evaluate quantitatively, making it difficult (but not impossible) to include in transport economics-based research and analysis.

Congestion is considered a negative [[externality]] by economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Small | first = Kenneth A. | last2 = José A. Gomez-Ibañez | year = 1998 | title = Road Pricing for Congestion Management: The Transition from Theory to Policy| publisher = The University of California Transportation Center, University of California at Berkeley| pages = 213 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An externality occurs when a transaction causes costs or benefits to third party, often, although not necessarily, from the use of a [[public good]]. For example, manufacturing or transportation cause air pollution imposing costs on others when making use of public air.

=== Traffic congestion ===
{{main|Traffic congestion}}
[[Image:I-80 Eastshore Fwy.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Typical traffic congestion in an urban freeway. Shown here is [[Interstate 80|I-80]] [[Eastshore Freeway]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], California.]]

Traffic congestion is a negative externality caused by various factors. A 2005 American study stated that there are seven root causes of congestion, and gives the following summary of their contributions: bottlenecks 40%, traffic incidents 25%, bad weather 15%, work zones 10%, poor signal timing 5%, and special events/other 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Traffic Congestion and Reliability: Trends and Advanced Strategies for Congestion Mitigation|date=1 September 2005|url=http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestion_report/congestion_report_05.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=U.S. Federal Highway Administration|accessdate=2008-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the transport economics community, [[congestion pricing]] is considered to be an appropriate mechanism to deal with this problem (i.e. to internalise the externality) by allocating scarce roadway capacity to users. Capacity expansion is also a potential mechanism to deal with traffic congestion, but is often undesirable (particularly in urban areas) and sometimes has questionable benefits (see [[induced demand]]). [[William Vickrey]], winner of the 1996 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]] for his work on "[[moral hazard]]", is considered one of the fathers of congestion pricing, as he first proposed it for the [[New York City Subway]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author= Vickrey, William | year=1992|url=http://www.vtpi.org/vickrey.htm|title= Principles of Efficient Congestion Pricing|accessdate=2008-02-26|publisher = Victoria Transport Policy Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the road transportation arena these theories were extended by [[Maurice Allais]], a fellow Nobel prize winner "for his pioneering contributions to the theory of markets and efficient utilization of resources", [[Gabriel Roth (economist)|Gabriel Roth]] who was instrumental in the first designs and upon whose [[World Bank]] recommendation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Walters | first = A. A. | year = 1968 | title = The Economics of Road User Charges| publisher = World Bank Staff Occasional Papers Number Five, Chapter VII, Washington, D.C. pp. 191–217| isbn = 978-0-8018-0653-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first system was put in place in Singapore. [[Reuben Smeed]], the deputy director of the [[Transport Research Laboratory|Transport and Road Research Laboratory]] was also a pioneer in this field, and his ideas were presented to the British government in what is known as the [[Smeed Report]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smeed, |first=R.J. |year=1964 |title=Road pricing: the economic and technical possibilities |publisher=HMSO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congestion is not limited to road networks; the negative externality imposed by congestion is also important in busy public transport networks as well as crowded pedestrian areas, e.g. on the London Underground on a weekday or any urban train station, at peak times. There is the classical excess in demand compared to supply. This is because at peak times there is a large demand for trains, since people want to go home (i.e., a derived demand). However, space on the platforms and on the trains is limited and small compared to the demand for it. As a result, there are crowds of people outside the train doors and in the train station corridors. This increases delays for commuters, which can often cause a rise in stress or other problems.

Congestion pricing is an [[Pareto efficiency|efficiency pricing]] strategy that requires the users to pay more for that public good, thus increasing the welfare gain or net benefit for society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Button | first = Kenneth J. | year = 1993 | title = op. cit| pages = 153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Small, Kenneth A. |author2=Verhoef, Erik T. | title = op. cit| year = 2007| pages = 120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congestion pricing is one of a number of alternative [[Supply and demand|demand side]] (as opposed to [[supply side]]) strategies offered by economists to address congestion.&lt;ref name="prm_winter_1995"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Congestion Control and Demand Management |author1=Sheldon G.

=== Pollution pricing ===
{{main|Pollution pricing}}
Since January 2008, [[Milan]] introduced a [[congestion pricing|traffic charge]] scheme as a one-year trial, called [[Ecopass]], that exempts higher emission standard vehicles ([[Euro IV]]) and other [[alternative fuel vehicle]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/automobiles/27GREEN.html  | title=Toll Discounts for Going Green  | author = Ken Belson | date=27 January 2008 | publisher =The New York Times  | accessdate=2008-01-27| language= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7167992.stm  | title=Milan introduces traffic charge  | date=2 March 2008 | publisher = BBC News | accessdate=2008-01-17| language= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.nysun.com/article/68854  | title= Milan Introduces Congestion Charge To Cut Pollution | author = Marco Bertacche | date=3 January 2008 | publisher = The New York Sun | accessdate=2008-01-17| language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later during the year the Ecopass was extended until 31 December 2009.&lt;ref name="Milano2009"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comune.milano.it/dseserver/webcity/comunicati.nsf/weball/077F561DB4A21D98C125752F004CDE33 | title=Ecopass.

Even the transport economists who advocate congestion pricing have anticipated several practical limitations, concerns and controversial issues regarding the actual implementation of this policy. As summarized by [[Robert Cervero]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Cervero | first = Robert | authorlink=Robert Cervero|year = 1998 | title = The Transit Metropolis | publisher = Island Press, Washington, D.C. | isbn = 1-55963-591-6  &lt;!--"Setting the prices right"--&gt;| pages = 67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; "True social-cost pricing of metropolitan travel has proven to be a theoretical ideal that so far has eluded real-world implementation. The primary obstacle is that except for professors of transportation economics and a cadre of vocal environmentalists, few people are in favor of considerably higher charges for peak-period travel. Middle-class motorists often complain they already pay too much in gasoline taxes and registration fees to drive their cars, and that to pay more during congested periods would add insult to injury. In the United States, few politicians are willing to champion the cause of congestion pricing in fear of reprisal from their constituents... Critics also argue that charging more to drive is elitist policy, pricing the poor off of roads so that the wealthy can move about unencumbered. It is for all these reasons that peak-periord pricing remains a pipe dream in the minds of many."

==== Road space rationing ====
{{main|Road space rationing}}
[[Image:Traffic jam Sao Paulo 09 2006 30.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Traffic congestion persists in [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]], despite no-drive days based on license numbers.]]

Transport economists consider [[road space rationing]] an alternative to congestion pricing, but road space rationing is considered more equitable, as the restrictions force all drivers to reduce auto travel, while congestion pricing restrains less those who can afford paying the congestion charge. Nevertheless, high-income users can avoid the restrictions by owning a second car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= Victoria Transport Policy Institute| url=http://www.vtpi.org/tdm/tdm33.htm |title=Vehicle Restrictions. Limiting Automobile Travel at Certain Times and Places |publisher= TDM Encyclopedia|accessdate=2008-04-09|language= }} See Equity Impacts section&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, congestion pricing (unlike rationing) acts "to allocate a scarce resource to its most valuable use, as evinced by users' willingness to pay for the resource". While some "opponents of congestion pricing fear that tolled roads will be used only by people with high income. But preliminary evidence suggests that the new toll lanes in California are used by people of all income groups. The ability to get somewhere fast and reliably is valued in a variety of circumstances. Not everyone will need or want to incur a toll on a daily basis, but on occasions when getting somewhere quickly is necessary, the option of paying to save time is valuable to people at all income levels." Road space rationing based on license numbers has been implemented in cities such as [[Athens]] (1982),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leda.ils.nrw.de/database/measures/meas0205.htm|title=LEDA Measure: License plate based traffic restrictions, Athens, Greece|publisher=LEDA database|accessdate=2008-04-09|language=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227030125/http://www.leda.ils.nrw.de/database/measures/meas0205.htm|archivedate=27 February 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[México City]] (1989), [[São Paulo]] (1997), [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]], [[Chile]], [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]], La Paz (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boliviahoy.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=3150 | title=Los choferes públicos acataron la restricción | date=7 January 2003 | publisher=La Prensa | accessdate=2008-04-09 | language=Spanish | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213053528/http://www.boliviahoy.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=3150 | archive-date=13 December 2006 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bolivia]], and [[San José de Costa Rica|San José]] (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2005/agosto/03/pais0.html | archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515152117/http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2005/agosto/03/pais0.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=15 May 2016 | title=Hoy empieza restricción para autos en centro de San José | author=Ángela Ávalos | date=3 August 2005 | publisher=La Nación | accessdate=2008-04-08 | language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2006/abril/12/pais2.html | title=Evaluarán restricción vehicular en capital | author=Mercedes Agüero | date=12 April 2006 | publisher=La Nación | accessdate=2008-04-08 | language=Spanish | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919101624/http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2006/abril/12/pais2.html | archivedate=19 September 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Costa Rica]].

==== Tradable mobility credits ====
A more acceptable policy on automobile travel restrictions, proposed by transport economists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = Verhoef E, [[Peter Nijkamp|Nijkamp P]], Rietveld P | url = http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=b240527 | year = 1997 | title = Tradeable permits: their potential in the regulation of road transport externalities | publisher = Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design 24(4) 527–548 |accessdate=2008-04-11  |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid inequality and revenue allocation issues, is to implement a [[rationing]] of peak period travel but through revenue-neutral credit-based congestion pricing. This concept is similar to the existing system of [[emissions trading]] of [[carbon credit]]s, proposed by the [[Kyoto Protocol]] to curb [[greenhouse emissions]]. Metropolitan area or city residents, or the taxpayers, will have the option to use the local government-issued mobility rights or congestion credits for themselves, or to trade or sell them to anyone willing to continue traveling by automobile beyond the personal quota.

== Funding and financing ==
Methods of funding and financing transport network maintenance, improvement and expansion are debated extensively and form part of the transport economics field.

Funding issues relate to the ways in which money is raised for the supply of transport capacity. Taxation and [[user fees]] are the main methods of fund-raising. Taxation may be general (e.g. [[income tax]]), local (e.g. [[sales tax]] or [[land value tax]]) or variable (e.g. [[fuel tax]]), and user fees may be tolls, congestion charges or fares). The method of funding often attracts strong political and public debate.

Financing issues relate to the way in which these funds are used to pay for the supply of transport. Loans, [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], [[public–private partnership]]s and concessions are all methods of financing transport investment.

== Regulation and competition ==
Regulation of the supply of transport capacity relates to both safety regulation and [[regulatory economics|economic regulation]]. Transport economics considers issues of the economic regulation of the supply of transport, particularly in relation to whether transport services and networks are provided by the public sector, by the private sector, or a mixture of both.

Transport networks and services can take on any combination of regulated/deregulated and public/private provision. For example, bus services in the UK outside London are provided by both the public and private sectors in a deregulated economic environment (where no-one specifies which services are to be provided, so the provision of services is influenced by the [[Market (economics)|market]]), whereas bus services within London are provided by the private sector in a regulated economic environment (where the public sector specifies the services to be provided and the private sector competes for the right to supply those services – i.e. [[franchising]]).

The regulation of public transport is often designed to achieve some social, geographic and temporal equity as market forces might otherwise lead to services being limited to the most popular travel times along the most densely settled corridors of development.  National, regional or municipal taxes are often deployed to provide a network that is socially acceptable (e.g. extending timetables through the daytime, weekend, holiday or evening periods and intensifying the mesh of routes beyond that which a lightly regulated market would probably provide).

Franchising may be used to create a supply of transport that balances the free-market supply outcome and the most socially desirable supply outcome.

== Project appraisal and evaluation ==
The most sophisticated methods of project appraisal and evaluation have been developed and applied in the transport sector. It should be noted that the terms 'appraisal' and 'evaluation' are often confused in relation to the assessment of projects. Appraisal refers to ''ex ante'' (before the event) assessment and evaluation refers to ''ex post'' (after the event) assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Green Book, Appraisal and evaluation in central government |url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/economic_data_and_tools/greenbook/data_greenbook_index.cfm |publisher=HM Treasury 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appraisal===

The appraisal of changes in the transport network is one of the most important applications of transport economics. In order to make an assessment of whether any given transport project should be carried out, transport economics can be used to compare the costs of the project with its benefits (both social and financial). Such an assessment is known as a [[cost-benefit analysis]], and is usually a fundamental piece of information for decision-makers, as it places a value on the net benefits (or disbenefits) of schemes and generates a ratio of benefits to costs which may be used to prioritise projects when funding is constrained.

A primary difficulty in project appraisal is the [[value of time|valuation of time]]. Travel time savings are often cited as a key benefit of transport projects, but people in different occupations, carrying out different activities and in different social classes value time differently.

Appraising projects on the basis of their supposed reductions in travel times has come under scrutiny in recent years with the recognition that improvements in capacity generate trips that would not have been made ([[induced demand]]), partially eroding the benefits of reduced travel times. Therefore, an alternative method of appraisal is to measure changes in [[land (economics)|land value]] and consumer benefits from a transport project rather than the measuring benefits accruing to travellers themselves. However, this method of analysis is much more difficult to carry out.

Another problem is that many transport projects have impacts that cannot be expressed in monetary terms, such as impacts on, for example, local air quality, biodiversity and community severance. Whilst these impacts can be included in a detailed [[environmental impact assessment]], a key issue has been how to present these assessments alongside estimates of those costs and benefits that can be expressed in monetary terms. Recent developments in transport appraisal practice in some European countries have seen the application of [[multi-criteria decision analysis]] based decision support tools. These build on existing [[cost-benefit analysis]] and environmental impact assessment techniques and help decision makers weigh up the monetary and non-monetary impacts of transport projects. In the UK, one such application, the [[New Approach to Appraisal]] has become a cornerstone of UK transport appraisal.

===Evaluation===

The evaluation of projects enables decision makers to understand whether the benefits and costs that were estimated in the appraisal materialised. Successful project evaluation requires that the necessary data to carry out the evaluation is specified in advance of carrying out the appraisal.

The appraisal and evaluation of projects form stages within a broader policy making cycle that includes:
* identifying a rationale for a project
* specifying objectives
* appraisal
* monitoring implementation of a project
* evaluation
* feedback to inform future projects

==Social effects on poverty==
In the US those with low income living in cities face a problem called “poverty transportation.” The problem arises because many of the entry level jobs which are sought out by those with little education are typically located in suburban areas. Those jobs are also not very accessible by public transportation because the transportation was often designed to move people around cities, which becomes a problem when the jobs are no longer located in the cities. Those who cannot afford cars inevitably suffer the worst, because they have no choice but to rely on public transport. The problem is illustrated by an estimation that 70% of entry level jobs are located in the suburbs, while only 32% of those jobs are within a quarter mile of public transportation.&lt;ref name="SanchezThomas"&gt;Sanchez, Thomas. ''Poverty, policy, and public transportation
''. Department of City &amp; Metropolitan Planning, University of Utah, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; More difficult (or more expensive) access to jobs and other goods &amp; services can act as a [[ghetto tax]].

As a result of the transportation systems in use, but not adequately meeting the needs of those who rely on them, they tend to generate low revenue. And with minimal revenue or funding the transportation systems are forced to decrease service and increase fares, which causes those in poverty to face more inequality. Further those who live in cities with no public transportation become even more excluded from education and work. In places with no public transport a car is the only viable option and that creates unnecessary strain on the roads and environment.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Spencer. ''The Social Inequality of Public Transit
'' 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since automobile use tends to be greater than public transportation use, it also becomes the norm for people to work towards car ownership. Private car ownership has led to a large allocation of resources towards road and bridge maintenance. But underfunding of public transportation prevents everyone who needs transportation from having access to it. And those who can choose between public transportation and private transportation will choose private transportation rather than face the inconveniences of public transportation. The lack of customers willing to use public transport creates a cycle that ultimately never leads to the transportation systems making significant progress.&lt;ref&gt;Colby, Greg. ''Urban Sprawl, Auto Dependency and Poverty
''.&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason for low private vehicle ownership among welfare recipients are the established asset limitations. In the U.S. the asset limit is $1000 per vehicle. This forces welfare recipients to purchase old and sub standard vehicles in order not to lose their welfare funding.&lt;ref name="SanchezThomas" /&gt;

There are a number of ways in which public transportation could be improved and for it to become a better and more enticing option for other people who do not necessarily depend on it. Some of these include creating networks of overlapping routes even among different operators to give people more choice in where and how they want to go somewhere. The system should also function as a whole, to prevent drivers from dangerously racing along routes to increase profit. Providing incentives to use public transportation can also be beneficial, as ridership increases the transportation systems can appropriately respond by increasing the frequency along those transportation routes. Even creating bus only lanes or priority lanes at intersections could improve service and speed.&lt;ref&gt;Munoz, Juan and Grange, Louis. ''On the development of public transit in large cities
''. Department of Transport Engineering and Logistics, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments done in Africa (Uganda and Tanzania) and Sri Lanka on hundreds of households have shown that a bicycle can increase the income of a poor family by as much as 35%&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bicyclepotential.org/&lt;/ref&gt;]. Transport, if analyzed for the cost-benefit analysis for rural poverty alleviation, has given one of the best returns in this regard. For example, road investments in India were a staggering 3–10 times more effective than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural economy in the decade of the 1990s. What a road does at a macro level to increase transport, the bicycle supports at the micro level. Bicycle, in that sense, can be one of the best means to eradicate the poverty in poor nations.

==Car taxation==
Car taxation is an instrument to influence the purchase decisions of consumers. Taxes can be differentiated to support the market introduction of fuel efficient and low [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emitting cars.

The European Union Commission has made a proposal for a Council Directive on passenger car taxation which is currently before the Council and Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/governance/impact/docs/ia_2005_2/COM_2005_0261_F_EN.pdf COM(2005) 261, Proposal for a COUNCIL DIRECTIVE on passenger car related taxes, presented by the Commission]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission encourages again Member States to adopt this proposal as soon as possible and to adapt their car taxation policies so as to promote the purchase of fuel efficient cars throughout the EU and help manufacturers respect the upcoming fuel efficiency framework, thus contributing their share to reducing the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions of cars. Taxes differentiated over the whole range of cars on the market, so as to gradually induce a switch towards less emitting cars, would be an efficient way to reduce compliance costs for manufacturers.

An '''ultrasonic pulse velocity test''' is an [[in-situ]], [[Nondestructive testing|nondestructive]] test to check the quality of [[concrete]] and natural rocks. In this test, the strength and quality of concrete or rock is assessed by measuring the velocity of an [[Ultrasonic testing|ultrasonic pulse]] passing through a concrete structure or natural rock formation. This test is conducted by passing a pulse of ultrasonic [[wave]] through concrete to be tested and measuring the time taken by pulse to get through the structure. Higher velocities indicate good quality and continuity of the material, while slower velocities may indicate concrete with many cracks or voids.

== Testing procedure ==
Ultrasonic testing equipment includes a pulse generation circuit, consisting of electronic circuit for generating pulses and a transducer for transforming electronic pulse into mechanical pulse having an oscillation frequency in range of 40&amp;nbsp;kHz to 50&amp;nbsp;kHz, and a pulse reception circuit that receives the signal.&lt;ref&gt;Equipment:
*http://www.azom.com/equipment-details.aspx?EquipID=2646
*http://www.proceq.com/nondestructivetestequipment/concrete-testing/ultrasonic-pulse-velocity.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The transducer, clock, oscillation circuit, and power source are assembled for use. After [[calibration]] to a standard sample of material with known properties, the transducers are placed on opposite sides of the material. Pulse velocity is measured by a simple formula:

&lt;math&gt;Pulse \;Velocity = \frac{\;Width \;of structure}{Time \;taken \;by \;pulse \;to \;go \;through}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Procedure:

== Interpretation of results ==
Quality of concrete in terms of strength, homogeneity, trapped air, internal flaws, cracks, segregation, honeycombing, compaction, workmanship, and durability can be concluded from this test. The test can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of crack repair.&lt;ref name=ASTM /&gt; Ultrasonic testing is an indicative and [[List of materials analysis methods|other tests]] such as [[destructive testing]] must be conducted to find the structural and mechanical properties of the material.&lt;ref&gt;Inferences:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3330">The '''Vertifolia effect''' is a well documented phenomenon in the fields of [[plant breeding]] and [[plant pathology]]. It is characterized by the erosion of a crop’s [[horizontal resistance]] to disease during a breeding cycle due to the presence of strong [[vertical resistance]], characterized by the presence of [[R genes]]. This phenomenon was first described by J.E. Van der Plank in his 1963 book Plant Disease: Epidemics and Control.&lt;ref name=Vanderplank1963&gt;Vanderplank, J.E. (1963) Plant Diseases: Epidemics and Control. Academic Press, New York and London, 194-195pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Plank observed that under artificial selection the potato variety Vertifolia had stronger vertical resistance to the potato late blight bacterium, ''Phytophthora infestans'', as measured by the presence of specific [[R genes]]. However, when the pathogen overcame these [[R genes]] Vertifolia exhibited a greater loss of [[horizontal resistance]] than varieties with fewer [[R genes]] and lower [[vertical resistance]].&lt;ref name=Vanderplank1963&gt;Vanderplank, J.E. (1963) Plant Diseases: Epidemics and Control. Academic Press, New York and London, 194-195pp.&lt;/ref&gt; This effect suggests that when a pathogen evolves an [[avirulence gene]] to counteract a variety’s R gene, that variety will be more susceptible to the pathogen than other varieties.

The Vertifolia effect has important implications for the breeding of disease resistant crops.  To avoid it plant breeders may opt to cross in R genes or insert transgenes at the end of the breeding cycle to maintain levels of horizontal resistance during  early rounds of selection. It is also suggests that breeders should focus on enhancing [[horizontal resistance]] to avoid potential catastrophic crop losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Worldshops also typically organize various  educational Fair Trade activities and play an active role in [[trade justice]] and other North-South political campaigns.

Worldshops are often [[not-for-profit]] organizations and run by locally based volunteer networks.

Although the movement emerged in [[Europe]] and a vast majority of worldshops are still based on the continent, worldshops can also be found today in [[North America]], [[Australia]], [[Israel]] and [[New Zealand]].

== History ==
[[Image:Oxfam shop on Drury Lane.jpg|thumb|Oxfam shop on [[Drury Lane]] in [[Covent Garden]], [[London]].]]
The start of the movement is usually attributed to the first worldshop in Europe, which was founded by [[Oxfam]] in 1959. The Oxfam shop sold Chinese bric-a-brac that had been sourced from Chinese [[refugees]] that had escaped the [[Chinese civil war|Communist revolution]] to [[Hong Kong]]. However, some sources credit the first fair trade shop that had been opened in the US in 1958, selling [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] needlework.

The shops were not called worldshops at that time, however. [[Alternative trading organisation]]s imported various [[third world]] goods, such as [[sugarcane|cane]] [[sugar]] starting in the 1960s, and still continuing today. These goods were sold in "third world shops" or "developing country shops" (the actual name differing from country to country). The most active organisations were operating in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Netherlands]]. The term "worldshop" came into existence in the 1990s. In 1994, worldshops organised themselves under the auspices of NEWS, the [[Network of European Worldshops]], who now falls under the [[World Fair Trade Organization]]. The [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark|Fairtrade]] label, which is used on fair trade products, has its roots in the 1980s worldshop movement.

== Aims ==
Worldshops' aim is to make [[trade]] as direct and [[fair trade|fair]] with the trading partners as possible. Usually, this means a producer in a [[developing country]] and consumers in [[industrialisation|industrialized]] countries. The worldshops' target is to pay the producers a fair price that guarantees subsistence and positive social development. They often cut out any intermediaries in the import chain.
