&lt;DIV ALIGN="justify"&gt;
'''50 Moganshan Road''' ({{zh|s=莫干山路50号}}) or "'''M50'''" is a [[contemporary art]] district in [[Shanghai]], [[China]], that houses a thriving community of more than a hundred artists whose studios are open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artspeakchina.org/mediawiki/index.php/Moganshan_Lu_%E8%8E%AB%E5%B9%B2%E5%B1%B1%E8%B7%AF Moganshan Lu] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214100737/http://www.artspeakchina.org/mediawiki/index.php/Moganshan_Lu_%E8%8E%AB%E5%B9%B2%E5%B1%B1%E8%B7%AF |date=2011-02-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lonely-planet"&gt;{{cite book| first=Christopher| last=Pitts| title=Pocket Shanghai | publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]| isbn=978-1-74179-963-7 | date=April 2013| edition=3rd | pages=86–87 | chapter=Top Sights: M50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often compared with New York's [[SoHo]] and Beijing's [[798 Art Zone]].&lt;ref name="chinaart"&gt;[http://www.chinaartnetworks.com/feature/wen21.shtml Shanghai SoHo--50 Moganshan Road] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820131527/http://www.chinaartnetworks.com/feature/wen21.shtml |date=2010-08-20 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The art quarter has become a popular cultural attraction for local and international visitors alike, and was named among the top ten things to do in Shanghai by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/travel/cityguide/article/0,31489,1851908_1851830_1851818,00.html Shanghai: 10 Things to Do], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The name refers to its actual address in Shanghai, and is often shortened to M50 or Moganshan Road.  It is tucked away in an old industrial area along the [[Suzhou Creek]].  The art quarter is located in industrial and residential [[Putuo District, Shanghai|Putuo District]], but conveniently close to downtown [[Jing'an District]].

==History==
50 Moganshan Road was once the Chunming Slub Mill.  The art scene was started in 2000 by local artist Xue Song who was initially attracted by the cheap rent of the disused industrial space. Other artists including Ding Yi, Qu Fengguo, and Wang Xingwei, soon followed.&lt;ref name="artzine"&gt;[http://www.artzinechina.com/display.php?a=81 Shanghai’s Blossoming Arts District] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128020315/http://www.artzinechina.com/display.php?a=81 |date=2012-01-28 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today the quarter’s former factories and warehouses have been converted into art galleries, artists’ studios, design agencies and other visual art and cultural businesses of various sizes.  The land and buildings are still owned by Shangtex, the state-owned textile group that operated the now defunct factory.&lt;ref name="chinaart"/&gt;

==Artists and galleries==
M50 hosts over 120 galleries and art studios.  Some of Shanghai's best known artists work here, including [[Zhou Tiehai]], [[Ding Yi (artist)|Ding Yi]], [[Yelan (artist)|Yelan]], [[Xu Zhen (artist)|Xu Zhen]] and the media art collective [[Liu Dao]]. Galleries include [[ShanghART]], [[EastLink Gallery]], [[island6]], [[Pantocrator Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://pantocratorgallery.com/ Pantocrator Gallery].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Biz Art]].&lt;ref name="artzine"/&gt;

==Transportation==
The closest [[Shanghai Metro]] station in the vicinity of M50 is [[Jiangning Road Station]] (on [[Line 13, Shanghai Metro|Line 13]]), followed by [[Zhongtan Road Station]] (on [[Line 3, Shanghai Metro|Line 3]] and [[Line 4, Shanghai Metro|Line 4]]).

'''''A Bar at the Folies-Bergère''''' ({{lang-fr|Un bar aux Folies Bergère}}), painted and exhibited at the [[Paris Salon]] in 1882, is considered the last major work of French painter [[Édouard Manet]]. It depicts a scene in the [[Folies Bergère]] nightclub in Paris. The painting originally belonged to the composer [[Emmanuel Chabrier]], who was a close friend of Manet. Chabrier hung it over his piano. The painting is currently in the [[Courtauld Gallery]] in London. 

==Painting==
The painting exemplifies Manet's commitment to [[Realism (art)|Realism]] in its detailed representation of a contemporary scene. Many features have puzzled critics but almost all of them have been shown to have a rationale, and the painting has been the subject of numerous popular and scholarly articles.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Park, ''Ambiguity, and the Engagement of Spatial Illusion within the Surface of Manet's Paintings'' (PhD diss., University of New South Wales, Australia, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thierry de Duve]], "Intentionality and Art Historical Methodology: A Case Study". Nonsite.org Issue #6, July 1, 2012 [http://nonsite.org/article/intentionality-and-art-historical-methodology-a-case-study] ; builds and corrects previous work  Thierry de Duve, ''How Manet's A Bar at the Folies-Bergere is Constructed'', Critical Enquiry, Vol. 25, No. 1, Autumn 1998, pp. 136-168.&lt;/ref&gt;

The central figure stands before a mirror, although critics—accusing Manet of ignorance of [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] and alleging various impossibilities in the painting—have debated this point since the earliest reviews were published. In 2000, however, a  photograph taken from a suitable point of view of a staged reconstruction was shown to reproduce the scene as painted by Manet.&lt;ref name="OneScholar'sPerspective"&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/manet_bar/looking_glass.html "Manet's ''Bar at the Folies-Bergère'': One Scholar's Perspective"], www.getty.edu. Retrieved July 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this reconstruction, "the conversation that many have assumed was transpiring between the barmaid and gentleman is revealed to be an optical trick—the man stands outside the painter's field of vision, to the left, and looks away from the barmaid, rather than standing right in front of her."&lt;ref name="OneScholar'sPerspective" /&gt; As it appears, the observer should be standing to the right and closer to the bar than the man whose reflection appears at the right edge of the picture. This is an unusual departure from the central point of view usually assumed when viewing pictures drawn according to perspective. 

Asserting the presence of the mirror has been crucial for many modern interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford R. Collins, ed., ''12 Views of Manet's Bar'', Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; It provides a meaningful parallel with ''[[Las Meninas]]'', a masterpiece by an artist Manet admired, [[Diego Velázquez]]. There has been a considerable development of this topic since [[Michel Foucault]] broached it in his book ''The [[Order of Things]]'' (1966).&lt;ref&gt;Foucault has given a talk on Manet's ''Bar'' at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo on April 8, 1970. He had planned a book on Manet's painting and gave a series of lectures during 1970/1 but the project was abandoned; see ''Cahiers de L'Herne: Michel Foucault'', mars 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The art historian Jeffrey Meyers describes the intentional play on perspective and the apparent violation of the operations of mirrors: "Behind her, and extending for the entire length of the four-and-a-quarter-foot painting, is the gold frame of an enormous mirror. The French philosopher [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] has called a mirror 'the instrument of a universal magic that changes things into spectacles, spectacles into things, me into others, and others into me.' We, the viewers, stand opposite the barmaid on the other side of the counter and, looking at the reflection in the mirror, see exactly what she sees... A critic has noted that Manet's 'preliminary study shows her placed off to the right, whereas in the finished canvas she is very much the centre of attention.' Though Manet shifted her from the right to the center, he kept her reflection on the right. Seen in the mirror, she seems engaged with a customer; in full face, she's self-protectively withdrawn and remote."&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Meyers, ''Impressionist Quartet: The Intimate Genius of Manet and Morisot, Degas and Cassatt''. New York: Harcourt, 2005. p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is rich in details which provide clues to social class and milieu. The woman at the bar is a real person, known as Suzon, who worked at the Folies-Bergère in the early 1880s. For his painting, Manet posed her in his studio. By including a dish of oranges in the foreground, Manet identifies the barmaid as a prostitute, according to art historian Larry L. Ligo, who says that Manet habitually associated oranges with prostitution in his paintings.&lt;ref name="Lanier102-103" /&gt; [[T. J. Clark (art historian)|T.J. Clark]] says that the barmaid is "intended to represent one of the prostitutes for which the Folies-Bergère was well-known", who is represented "as both a salesperson and a commodity—something to be purchased along with a drink."&lt;ref name="Lanier102-103"&gt;Doris Lanier, ''Absinthe, the Cocaine of the Nineteenth Century: A History of the Hallucinogenic Drug and Its Effect on Artists and Writers in Europe and the United States'', McFarland, 2004, pp. 102–103.  {{ISBN|0786419679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable details include the pair of green feet in the upper left-hand corner, which belong to a [[trapeze artist]] who is performing above the restaurant's patrons. The beer bottles depicted are easily identified by the red triangle on the label as [[Bass Pale Ale]], and the conspicuous presence of this English brand instead of German beer has been interpreted as documentation of anti-German sentiment in France in the decade after the [[Franco-Prussian War]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Bendiner, ''Food In Painting: From The Renaissance To The Present'', Reaktion Books, 2004, pp. 73–74. {{ISBN|1861892136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==

The 1934 ballet ''[[Bar aux Folies-Bergère (ballet)|Bar aux Folies-Bergère]]'' with choreography by [[Ninette de Valois]] and music of [[Emmanuel Chabrier|Chabrier]] was created from, and based around, Manet's painting.&lt;ref name="Quicksilver"&gt;Rambert, Marie. ''Quicksilver: an autobiography.'' Papermac (Macmillan Publishers Ltd), London, 1983, p157.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1947 film ''[[The Private Affairs of Bel Ami]]'' faithfully references ''A Bar at the Folies-Bergère'' twenty nine minutes into the film with a look-alike actress, set and props as the main characters enter the establishment.

The painting was the inspiration of a song (possibly by [[Sydney Carter]]) in the popular theatre production ''The Lyric Revue'', in London in 1951. The refrain went "Oh, how I long to be Back in my dear Brittany ... But fate has chosen me For the bar at the Folies-Bergères".

The painting ''[[The Bar (painting)|The Bar]]'' (1954) by Australian artist [[John Brack]], which depicts a comparatively grim and austere [[Melbourne]] bar-room scene, is an ironic reference to ''A Bar at the Folies-Bergère''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/arts/the-great-art-robbery/2006/04/14/1144521505593.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1|title=The great art robbery |work=The Age|date=2006-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1988 Eddie Murphy film ''Coming To America'', during the party scene at McDowell's house, there is a spoof on the painting above the couch, in which the central female figure is replaced with a dark-skinned woman instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094898/trivia|title=Coming to America (1988)|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian artist [[Jeff Wall]] makes reference to ''A Bar at the Folies-Bergère'' in his work ''[[Picture for Women]]'' (1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Tate Modern National Gallery, London UK; Jeff Wall Photographs 1978-2004| date= 21 October 2005| url= http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/jeffwall/rooms/room1.shtm| accessdate= 2007-11-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071026074720/http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/jeffwall/rooms/room1.shtm| archivedate= 2007-10-26| deadurl= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merritt, Naomi. [http://www.melbourneartjournal.unimelb.edu.au/E-MAJ/ "Manet's Mirror and Jeff Wall's ''Picture for Women'': Reflection or Refraction?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605094933/http://www.melbourneartjournal.unimelb.edu.au/E-MAJ/ |date=2010-06-05 }} ''Emaj'' (Electronic Melbourne Art Journal), Issue 4, 2009. Merritt discusses the role of the mirror in this work.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tate Modern]] wall text for ''Picture of Women'', from the 2005–2006 exhibition ''Jeff Wall Photographs 1978–2004'', outlines the influence of Manet's painting: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In Manet's painting, a barmaid gazes out of frame, observed by a shadowy male figure. The whole scene appears to be reflected in the mirror behind the bar, creating a complex web of viewpoints. Wall borrows the internal structure of the painting, and motifs such as the light bulbs that give it spatial depth. The figures are similarly reflected in a mirror, and the woman has the absorbed gaze and posture of Manet's barmaid, while the man is the artist himself. Though issues of the male gaze, particularly the power relationship between male artist and female model, and the viewer's role as onlooker, are implicit in Manet's painting, Wall updates the theme by positioning the camera at the centre of the work, so that it captures the act of making the image (the scene reflected in the mirror) and, at the same time, looks straight out at us.&lt;ref&gt;Gallery Guide text for the exhibition Jeff Wall Photographs 1978–2004, Tate Modern, London, 21 October 2005 to 8 January 2006 quoted in [[David Campany]], "'A Theoretical Diagram in an Empty Classroom': Jeff Wall's Picture for Women", ''Oxford Art Journal'' 20.1 (2007): 12-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3223">'''''Disputatio inter clericum et militem''''' ('''''A Dispute Between a Priest and a Knight''''') is a dialogue, written in France between 1296 and 1303. Although anonymous, it could have been [[John of Paris]], master of the [[University of Paris]]. The treatise examines the relationship between [[Separation of church and state (medieval)|Church and King]] through a fictional dialogue between a Priest and a Knight. 

It was written during the period of the acrimonious dispute between King [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] and Pope [[Boniface VIII]], which culminated in the Papal bull ''[[Unam sanctam]]'' of 1302. It is essentially propaganda. The furious reaction of Philip and his ministry expressed in the ''Disputatio'' (written in simple language for a popular audience) can be understood within the context of a conflict between the increasing power of secular rulers in France and England, who were attempting to tax the clergy to support warfare. Boniface's stringent reaction was the fierce bull ''[[Clericis laicos]]'' of 1296, which set off the dispute. The dialogue can be fitted into the context of the debate over the extent of church powers that was raging in the time delimited by the two bulls.

However, the work remained unknown in its own time and was not published until 1378. A translation by [[John Trevisa]] (1342-1402) was popular in England because of its antipapalism, and it continued to be popular in the 16th century for similar reasons.

In the story the knight and priest exchange rapid fire and simple dialogue designed to reach a broad audience. The knight's intention is to prove that soft-living wealthy clerics, who have more money than needed, should hand the extra income over to secular leaders, whose job it is to deal in more earthly affairs. Specifically it is the job of secular leaders to protect the Church from outside threats, and the Church must pay the nobles for their own protection. Within the realm of the kingdom, kings have ultimate authority over all matters and the Church must obey the right of the king to tax the Church for the purpose of protection. If it refuses, the king may seize Church property.

''Disputatio'' was a sharp criticism of the church and foreshadowed further 14th century arguments that pitted royalist national sovereignty against the principles of [[papal supremacy]].

John of Paris also wrote a related work entitled "On Royal and Papal Power" about the autonomous nature of kingdoms, an early expression of the concept of sovereignty.

 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; controversial book by [[Stephen Wolfram]], published by his own company in 2002. It contains an empirical and systematic study of computational systems such as [[cellular automata]]. Wolfram calls these systems ''simple programs'' and argues that the [[Philosophy of science|scientific philosophy]] and methods appropriate for the study of simple programs are relevant to other fields of science.

== Contents ==

=== Computation and its implications===
The thesis of ''A New Kind of Science'' (''NKS'') is twofold: that the nature of [[computation]] must be explored experimentally, and that the results of these experiments have great relevance to understanding the [[physical world]]. Since its nascent beginnings in the 1930s, computation has been primarily approached from two traditions: [[engineering]], which seeks to build practical systems using computations; and [[mathematics]], which seeks to prove theorems about computation.  However, as recently as the 1970s, computing has been described as being at the crossroads of mathematical, engineering, and empirical traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = Peter | last = Wegner | title = Research Paradigms in Computer Science | booktitle = Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Software Engineering | pages = 322–330 | publisher = IEEE Press | year = 1976 | location = San Francisco, CA, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | last = Denning | first = Peter J. | title = Computing as a Discipline | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–23 | year = 1989| doi = 10.1145/63238.63239|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfram introduces a third tradition that seeks to empirically investigate computation for its own sake: He argues that an entirely new method is needed to do so because traditional mathematics fails to meaningfully describe [[complex systems]], and that there is an upper limit to complexity in all systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://serendip.brynmawr.edu/local/scisoc/emergence/DBergerNKS.pdf The World According to Wolfram]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simple programs===
The basic subject of Wolfram's "new kind of science" is the study of simple abstract rules—essentially, elementary [[computer program]]s. In almost any class of a computational system, one very quickly finds instances of great complexity among its simplest cases (after a time series of multiple iterative loops, applying the same simple set of rules on itself, similar to a self-reinforcing cycle using a set of rules). This seems to be true regardless of the components of the system and the details of its setup. Systems explored in the book include, amongst others, cellular automata in one, two, and three dimensions; [[Mobile automaton|mobile automata]]; [[Turing machine]]s in 1 and 2 dimensions; several varieties of substitution and network systems; primitive recursive functions; nested [[recursion (computer science)|recursive functions]]; [[combinator]]s; [[tag system]]s; [[register machine]]s; [[Palindromic number|reversal-addition]]. For a program to qualify as simple, there are several requirements:
# Its operation can be completely explained by a simple graphical illustration.
# It can be completely explained in a few sentences of [[human language]].
# It can be implemented in a computer language using just a few lines of code.
# The number of its possible variations is small enough so that all of them can be computed.

Generally, simple programs tend to have a very simple abstract framework. Simple cellular automata, Turing machines, and combinators are examples of such frameworks, while more complex cellular automata do not necessarily qualify as simple programs. It is also possible to invent new frameworks, particularly to capture the operation of natural systems. The remarkable feature of simple programs is that a significant percentage of them are capable of producing great complexity. Simply enumerating all possible variations of almost any class of programs quickly leads one to examples that do unexpected and interesting things.  This leads to the question: if the program is so simple, where does the complexity come from? In a sense, there is not enough room in the program's definition to directly encode all the things the program can do. Therefore, simple programs can be seen as a minimal example of [[emergence]]. A logical deduction from this phenomenon is that if the details of the program's rules have little direct relationship to its behavior, then it is very difficult to directly engineer a simple program to perform a specific behavior. An alternative approach is to try to engineer a simple overall computational framework, and then do a [[brute-force search]] through all of the possible components for the best match.

Simple programs are capable of a remarkable range of behavior. Some have been proven to be [[universal computer]]s. Others exhibit properties familiar from traditional science, such as [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] behavior, [[continuum mechanics|continuum]] behavior, conserved quantities, [[percolation]], [[sensitive dependence on initial conditions]], and others. They have been used as models of [[traffic]], material fracture, [[crystal growth]], biological growth, and various [[sociology|sociological]], [[geology|geological]], and [[ecology|ecological]] phenomena. Another feature of simple programs is that, according to the book, making them more complicated seems to have little effect on their overall [[complexity]]. ''A New Kind of Science'' argues that this is evidence that simple programs are enough to capture the essence of almost any [[complex system]].

===Mapping and mining the computational universe===
In order to study simple rules and their often complex behaviour, Wolfram argues that it is necessary to systematically explore all of these computational systems and document what they do. He further argues that this study should become a new branch of science, like [[physics]] or [[chemistry]].  The basic goal of this field is to understand and characterize the computational universe using experimental methods.

The proposed new branch of scientific exploration admits many different forms of scientific production. For instance, qualitative classifications are often the results of initial forays into the computational jungle. On the other hand, explicit proofs that certain systems compute this or that function are also admissible. There are also some forms of production that are in some ways unique to this field of study. For example, the discovery of computational mechanisms that emerge in different systems but in bizarrely different forms.

Another kind of production involves the creation of programs for the analysis of computational systems. In the ''NKS'' framework, these themselves should be simple programs, and subject to the same goals and methodology. An extension of this idea is that the human mind is itself a computational system, and hence providing it with raw data in as effective a way as possible is crucial to research. Wolfram believes that programs and their analysis should be visualized as directly as possible, and exhaustively examined by the thousands or more. Since this new field concerns abstract rules, it can in principle address issues relevant to other fields of science. However, in general Wolfram's idea is that novel ideas and mechanisms can be discovered in the computational universe, where they can be represented in their simplest forms, and then other fields can choose among these discoveries for those they find relevant.

Wolfram has since expressed "A central lesson of ''A New Kind of Science'' is that there’s a lot of incredible richness out there in the computational universe. And one reason that’s important is that it means that there’s a lot of incredible stuff out there for us to 'mine' and harness for our purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2017/05/a-new-kind-of-science-a-15-year-view/|title=A New Kind of Science: A 15-Year View—Stephen Wolfram|last=|first=|date=|website=blog.stephenwolfram.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systematic abstract science===
While Wolfram advocates simple programs as a scientific discipline, he also argues that its methodology will revolutionize other fields of science. The basis of his argument is that the study of simple programs is the minimal possible form of science,  grounded equally in both [[abstraction]] and empirical experimentation. Every aspect of the methodology advocated in ''NKS'' is optimized to make experimentation as direct, easy, and meaningful as possible while maximizing the chances that the experiment will do something unexpected. Just as this methodology allows computational mechanisms to be studied in their simplest forms, Wolfram argues that the process of doing so engages with the mathematical basis of the physical world, and therefore has much to offer the sciences.

Wolfram argues that the computational realities of the universe make science hard for fundamental reasons. But he also argues that by understanding the importance of these realities, we can learn to use them in our favor. For instance, instead of [[reverse engineering]] our theories from observation, we can [[enumeration|enumerate]] systems and then try to match them to the behaviors we observe. A major theme of ''NKS''  is investigating the structure of the possibility space. Wolfram argues that science is far too ad hoc, in part because the models used are too complicated and unnecessarily organized around the limited primitives of traditional mathematics. Wolfram advocates using models whose variations are enumerable and whose consequences are straightforward to compute and analyze.

===Philosophical underpinnings===

====Computational irreducibility====
Wolfram argues that one of his achievements is in providing a coherent system of ideas that justifies computation as an organizing [[Philosophy of science|principle of science]]. For instance, he argues that the concept of ''[[computational irreducibility]]'' (that some complex computations are not amenable to short-cuts and cannot be "reduced"), is ultimately the reason why computational models of nature must be considered in addition to traditional [[mathematical models]]. Likewise, his idea of intrinsic randomness generation—that natural systems can generate their own randomness, rather than using chaos theory or stochastic perturbations—implies that computational models do not need to include explicit randomness.

====Principle of computational equivalence====
Based on his experimental results, Wolfram developed the '''principle of computational equivalence'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ('''PCE'''): the principle states that [[systems]] found in the [[natural environment|natural world]] can perform [[computation]]s up to a [[maximum|maximal]] ("universal") level of [[computational power]]. Most systems can attain this level. Systems, in principle, compute the same things as a computer. Computation is therefore simply a question of translating [[Input/output|input and outputs]] from one system to another. Consequently, most systems are computationally equivalent. Proposed examples of such systems are the workings of the human brain and the evolution of weather systems.

The principle can be restated as follows: almost all processes that are not obviously simple are of equivalent sophistication. From this principle, Wolfram draws an array of concrete deductions which he argues reinforce his theory. Possibly the most important among these is an explanation as to why we experience [[randomness]] and [[complexity]]: often, the systems we analyze are just as sophisticated as we are. Thus, complexity is not a special quality of systems, like for instance the concept of "heat,"  but simply a label for all systems whose computations are sophisticated. Wolfram argues that understanding this makes possible the "normal science" of the ''NKS'' paradigm.

At the deepest level, Wolfram argues that—like many of the most important scientific ideas—the principle of computational equivalence allows science to be more general by pointing out new ways in which humans are not "special"; that is, it has been claimed that the complexity of human intelligence makes us special, but the Principle asserts otherwise. In a sense, many of Wolfram's ideas are based on understanding the scientific process—including the human mind—as operating within the same universe it studies, rather than being outside it.

===Applications and results===
There are a number of specific results and ideas in the ''NKS'' book, and they can be organized into several themes. One common theme of examples and applications is demonstrating how little complexity it takes to achieve interesting behavior, and how the proper methodology can discover this behavior.

First, there are several cases where the ''NKS'' book introduces what was, during the book's composition, the simplest known system in some class that has a particular characteristic. Some examples include the first primitive recursive function that results in complexity, the smallest universal [[Turing Machine]], and the shortest [[axiom]] for [[propositional calculus]]. In a similar vein, Wolfram also demonstrates many simple programs that exhibit phenomena like [[phase transition]]s, [[conserved quantity|conserved quantities]], continuum behavior, and [[thermodynamics]] that are familiar from traditional science. Simple [[computational model]]s of natural systems like [[shell growth]], [[fluid turbulence]], and [[phyllotaxis]] are a final category of applications that fall in this theme.

Another common theme is taking facts about the computational universe as a whole and using them to reason about fields in a [[holistic]] way. For instance, Wolfram discusses how facts about the computational universe inform [[evolutionary theory]], [[SETI]], [[free will]], [[computational complexity theory]], and philosophical fields like [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], and even [[postmodernism]].

Wolfram suggests that the theory of computational irreducibility may provide a resolution to the existence of free will in a nominally [[deterministic]] universe.  He posits that the computational process in the [[brain]] of the being with free will is actually [[Complexity|complex]] enough so that it cannot be captured in a simpler computation, due to the principle of computational irreducibility.  Thus, while the process is indeed deterministic, there is no better way to determine the being's will than, in essence, to run the experiment and let the being exercise it.

The book also contains a vast number of individual results—both experimental and analytic—about what a particular automaton computes, or what its characteristics are, using some methods of analysis.

The book contains a new technical result in describing the [[Turing completeness]] of the [[Rule 110]] cellular automaton. Very small Turing machines can simulate Rule 110, which Wolfram demonstrates using a 2-state 5-symbol [[universal Turing machine]]. Wolfram conjectures that a particular [[Wolfram's 2-state 3-symbol Turing machine|2-state 3-symbol Turing machine]] is universal. In 2007, as part of commemorating the book's fifth anniversary, Wolfram's company offered a $25,000 prize for proof that this Turing machine is universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Wolfram 2,3 Turing Machine Research Prize | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/ | accessdate=2011-03-31| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110515032324/http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/| archivedate= 15 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alex Smith, a computer science student from [[Birmingham]], UK, won the prize later that year by proving Wolfram's conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Wolfram 2,3 Turing Machine Is Universal! | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/solution_news.html | accessdate=2007-10-24| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Technical Commentary [on Wolfram 2,3 Turing machine universality proof] | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/solution_technical.html | accessdate=2007-10-24| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NKS Summer School==
Every year, Wolfram and his group of instructors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/2009/faculty.html|title=Wolfram Science Summer School 2009: Faculty|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; organize a summer school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/|title=Wolfram Science Summer School|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2003 to 2006, these classes were held at [[Brown University]]. In 2007, the summer school began being hosted by the [[University of Vermont]] at Burlington, with the exception of 2009 which was held at the Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione of the CNR in [[Pisa, Italy]].  In 2012, the program was held at [[Curry College]] in [[Milton, Massachusetts]]. Since 2013, the Wolfram Summer School has been held annually at [[Bentley University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]]. After 14 consecutive summer schools, more than 550 people have participated, some of whom continued developing their 3-week research projects as their Master's or Ph.D theses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/2006/participants/letourneau.html|title=Wolfram Science Summer School 2006: Alumni—Paul-Jean Letourneau|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the research done in the summer school has resulted in publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Rowland | title=A natural prime-generating recurrence | year=2008 | volume=11 | issue=08 | journal=Journal of Integer Sequences| arxiv=0710.3217 | bibcode=2008JIntS..11...28R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m624350kj28305u9/|title=Planar Trivalent Network Computation | doi=10.1007/978-3-540-74593-8_13 | journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=146–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Palasek , S. | title=Information flow in cellular automata | year=2013 | volume=22 | issue=2 | pages=193–202 | journal=Complex Systems | url=http://www.complex-systems.com/pdf/22-2-4.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published on April 3, 2018, ''A New Kind of Science'' was listed among the 190 books recommended by Bill Gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolinsky|first=Jacob|title=190 Books Recommended by Bill Gates|url=https://www.valuewalk.com/2018/04/bill-gates-books/|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific philosophy===
A tenet of ''NKS'' is that the simpler the system, the more likely a version of it will recur in a wide variety of more complicated contexts. Therefore, ''NKS'' argues that systematically exploring the space of simple programs will lead to a base of reusable knowledge. However, many scientists believe that of all possible parameters, only some actually occur in the universe. For instance, of all possible permutations of the symbols making up an equation, most will be essentially meaningless. ''NKS'' has also been criticized for asserting that the behavior of simple systems is somehow representative of all systems.

===Methodology===
A common criticism of ''NKS'' is that it does not follow established [[scientific methodology]]. For instance, ''NKS'' does not establish [[rigorous]] mathematical definitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=David|title=A Reclusive Kind of Science|journal=Computing in Science and Engineering|pages=79–81|date=September 2002|url = http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/dhbpapers/dhb-wolfram.pdf|accessdate=28 May 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; nor does it attempt to prove [[theorem]]s; and most formulas and equations are written in [[Mathematica]] rather than standard notation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Mathematician Looks at Wolfram's New Kind of Science|last=Gray|first=Lawrence|journal=Notices of the AMS|year=2003|volume=50|issue=2|pages=200–211|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200302/fea-gray.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines, ''NKS'' has also been criticized for being heavily visual, with much information conveyed by pictures that do not have formal meaning.&lt;ref name=Berry/&gt; It has also been criticized for not using modern research in the field of [[complexity]], particularly the works that have studied complexity from a rigorous mathematical perspective.&lt;ref name=Shalizi/&gt; And it has been criticized for misrepresenting [[chaos theory]]: "Throughout the book, he equates chaos theory with the phenomenon of sensitive dependence on initial conditions (SDIC)."&lt;ref name=Drysdale&gt;{{cite web|last=Drysdale|first=David|title=Review of "A New Kind of Science"|url=http://www.lurklurk.org/wolfram/review.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utility===
''NKS'' has been criticized for not providing specific results that would be immediately applicable to ongoing scientific research.&lt;ref name=Berry/&gt; There has also been criticism, implicit and explicit, that the study of simple programs has little connection to the physical universe, and hence is of limited value. [[Steven Weinberg]] has pointed out that no real world system has been explained using Wolfram's methods in a satisfactory fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/In+search+of+a+scientific+revolution%3A+controversial+genius+Stephen...-a0107699603 | work=Science News | title=In search of a scientific revolution: controversial genius Stephen Wolfram presses onward | first=Peter | last=Weiss | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PCE===
The '''Principle of computational equivalence''' has been criticized for being vague, unmathematical, and for not making directly verifiable predictions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;!-- However, Wolfram's group has described the principle as such, not a law, theorem or formula. [They described it as being vague, unmathematical, and not able to make directly verifiable predictions?] --&gt; It has also been criticized for being contrary to the spirit of research in mathematical logic and computational complexity theory, which seek to make fine-grained distinctions between levels of computational sophistication, and for wrongly conflating different kinds of universality property.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Moreover, critics such as [[Ray Kurzweil]] have argued that it ignores the distinction between hardware and software; while two computers may be equivalent in power, it does not follow that any two programs they might run are also equivalent.&lt;ref name=Kurzweil/&gt; Others suggest it is little more than a rechristening of the [[Church–Turing thesis]].&lt;ref name=Drysdale/&gt;&lt;!--  However, the Church-Turing thesis imposes an upper limit while Wolfram's PCE suggests the nonexistence of intermediate degrees of computation sending a computational system either to the upper level (universal) or to the lowest degree. [No. The claim is that intermediate degrees are derived from the complete degree, hence equivalent in "sophistication".] --&gt;

===The fundamental theory (''NKS'' Chapter 9)===
Wolfram's speculations of a direction towards a fundamental theory of physics have been criticized as vague and obsolete. [[Scott Aaronson]], Professor of Computer Science at University of Texas Austin, also claims that Wolfram's methods cannot be compatible with both [[special relativity]] and [[Bell's theorem]] violations, and hence cannot explain the observed results of [[Bell test experiments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aaronson|first=Scott|title=Book Review of ''A New Kind of Science''|journal=Quantum Information and Computation|volume=2|issue=5|year=2002|pages=410–423|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/nks.ps}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aaronson's arguments are either right and apply to the entire scientific field of [[Quantum gravity]] that seeks to find theories unifying relativity and quantum mechanics or they are fundamentally flawed (e.g. under a non-local hidden variable theory of superdeterminism acknowledged by Bell himself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = J. S. | year = 1981 | title = Bertlmann's socks and the nature of reality | url = | journal = Journal de Physique | volume = 42 | issue = C2| pages = 41–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and even explored by e.g. physics Nobel laureate [[Gerard 't Hooft]],&lt;ref name="'t Hooft, G"&gt;{{Cite arXiv|author='t Hooft, G.|title=Discreteness and Determinism in Superstrings |date=15 Sep 2012|eprint=1207.3612}}&lt;/ref&gt; see also replies to [[Digital physics#Locality|criticism of digital physics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Wheeler]], 1990, "Information, physics, quantum: The search for links" in W. Zurek (ed.) ''Complexity, Entropy, and the Physics of Information''. Redwood City, CA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee Smolin, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0201031 Matrix models as non-local hidden variables theories]", 2002; also published in [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-26669-0_10 Quo Vadis Quantum Mechanics? The Frontiers Collection], [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]], 2005, pp 121-152, {{ISBN|978-3-540-22188-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Disputed inline|date=April 2017}}

[[Edward Fredkin]] and [[Konrad Zuse]] pioneered the idea of a [[Cellular automaton#CA as models of the fundamental physical reality|computable universe]], the former by writing a line in his book on how the world might be like a cellular automaton, and later further developed by Fredkin using a toy model called Salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.usf.edu/~eclark/ANKOS_zuse_fredkin_thesis.html|title=ZUSE-FREDKIN-THESIS|work=usf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed that ''NKS'' tries to take these ideas as its own but Wolfram's model of the universe is a rewriting network and not a cellular automaton as Wolfram himself has suggested a cellular automaton cannot account for relativistic features such as no absolute time frame.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/section-9.7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] has also charged that his work on [[Turing machine]]-computable [[physics]] was stolen without attribution, namely his idea on enumerating possible Turing-computable universes.&lt;ref name=Schmid&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmidhuber|first=Jurgen|title=Origin of main ideas in Wolfram's book "A New Kind of Science"|url=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/wolfram.html|publisher=CERN Courier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2002 review of ''NKS'', the Nobel laureate and elementary particle physicist [[Steven Weinberg]] wrote, "Wolfram himself is a lapsed elementary particle physicist, and I suppose he can't resist trying to apply his experience with digital computer programs to the laws of nature. This has led him to the view (also considered in a 1981 paper by Richard Feynman) that nature is discrete rather than continuous. He suggests that space consists of a set of isolated points, like cells in a cellular automaton, and that even time flows in discrete steps. Following an idea of Edward Fredkin, he concludes that the universe itself would then be an automaton, like a giant computer. It's possible, but I can't see any motivation for these speculations, except that this is the sort of system that Wolfram and others have become used to in their work on computers. So might a carpenter, looking at the moon, suppose that it is made of wood."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Weinberg, S.|title=Is the Universe a Computer?|journal=The New York Review of Books|date=24 October 2002|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/15762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nobel laureate [[Gerard 't Hooft]] has more recently also suggested a cellular automaton-based unifying theory of quantum gravity as an interpretation of superstring theory where the evolution equations are classical, "[b]oth the bosonic string theory and superstring theory can be reformulated in terms of a special basis of states, defined on a [[space-time]] [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] with lattice length &lt;math&gt;2\pi\sqrt{\alpha'.}&lt;/math&gt;"&lt;ref name="'t Hooft, G"/&gt;

===Natural selection===
Wolfram's claim that [[natural selection]] is not the fundamental cause of complexity in biology has led non-scientist journalist Chris Lavers to state that Wolfram does not understand the [[theory of evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lavers|first=Chris|title=How the cheetah got his spots|publisher=The Guardian|date=3 August 2002|url= https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4473834,00.html|accessdate=28 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Originality===
''NKS'' has been heavily criticized as not being original or important enough to justify its title and claims.

The authoritative manner in which ''NKS'' presents a vast number of examples and arguments has been criticized as leading the reader to believe that each of these ideas was original to Wolfram;&lt;ref name=Drysdale/&gt; in particular, one of the most substantial new technical results presented in the book, that the [[Rule 110|rule 110 cellular automaton]] is [[Turing complete]], was not proven by Wolfram, but by his research assistant, [[Matthew Cook]]. However, the notes section at the end of his book acknowledges many of the discoveries made by these other scientists citing their names together with historical facts, although not in the form of a traditional bibliography section. Additionally, the idea that very simple rules often generate great complexity is already an established idea in science, particularly in [[chaos theory]] and [[complex systems]].&lt;ref name=Shalizi/&gt;

{{for|the former Adelaide College of the Arts and Education|University of South Australia}}
The '''Adelaide College of the Arts''', (also known as '''AC Arts'''), (previously known as Adelaide Centre for the Arts) is a campus of [[TAFE South Australia]] that specialises in [[performing arts education]]. It is located on [[Light Square, Adelaide]], opposite the Adelaide campus of TAFE SA.

Identified major study areas of the centre are:
* Entertainment Technicians &amp; Designers
* Entertainment Technology
* Performing Arts (Acting and Dance)
* Professional Writing
* Visual Arts

==Courses==
Adelaide College for the Arts (AC Arts) provides both short and award courses.

Award Courses:
*Film and Television Production
*Live Production, Theatre and Events (Technical Operations)
*Costume for Performance
*Live Production, Theatre and Events (Technical Production)
*Scenery and Set Construction
*Acting
*Design for Live Production, Theatre and Events
*Stage Management
*Dance
*Jewellery
*3D Ceramics and Sculpture

==Campus==
AC Arts' purpose built $30 million campus was designed by award winning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Australian Architecture Awards|url=http://www.architectureanddesign.com.au/news/south-australian-architecture-awards-honour-renown}}&lt;/ref&gt; architect Adrian Evans during his time with the Adelaide-based firm Hassel.&lt;ref name=Postcards&gt;{{cite web|title=Postcards |url=http://www.postcards-sa.com.au/features/roma_mitchell_arts_centre.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050619162900/http://postcards-sa.com.au/features/roma_mitchell_arts_centre.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatres===
AC Arts has two main theatre spaces.  These are used for in house performances and also for professional productions especially during the [[Adelaide Fringe Festival|Adelaide Fringe]] and the [[Adelaide Festival]].

The 'Main Theatre' is a proscenium arch theatre that seats 220 and the 'X Space' experimental theatre that seats 110.  Both spaces are 'industry-standard' allowing students to learn in an environment as close as possible to the professional world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AC Arts Website - Performing Arts Facilities|url=http://www.tafesa.edu.au/adelaide-college-of-the-arts/acarts-performing-arts?t=2&amp;r=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acting and Dance Studios===
On the third floor of the building there are four dance studios with mirrors and bars, four acting studios and a music room.  Two of the acting studios (The Stables and the David Kendall Studio) double as performance spaces with easy black out ability.

==History==
The centre was created in 2001 from an amalgamation of the Centre for Performing Arts (previously located in [[Grote Street, Adelaide|Grote Street]]) and the North Adelaide School of Arts (previously located in Stanley Street, North Adelaide). The new building on Light Square was constructed to house the new centre, and opened in March 2001.&lt;ref name="TAFE ACArts History"&gt;{{cite web | title = Adelaide Centre for the Arts - History | work = TAFE SA website | url = http://www.tafe.sa.edu.au/Campuses/CampusList/AdelaideCentrefortheARTS/History/tabid/1185/Default.aspx/CatholicEducationOfficesSA/our-schools/find-a-school?id=2309 | accessdate =  2008-07-27 }} {{Dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Centre for Performing Arts===
The Centre for the Performing Arts (CPA) was established in 1978 on the site of the old [[Adelaide Girls High School]], adjacent to the [[Adelaide Central Market]].

Set up by Dr Barry Young, it initially offered courses in [[dance]] and [[technical production]]. An acting course was introduced in 1986, headed by David Kendall. In 1997 an introductory acting course was established, called Prologue.&lt;ref name="TAFE ACArts History" /&gt;

===North Adelaide School of Arts===
The North Adelaide School of Arts (NASA) was established in 1979 on a site vacated the previous year by the [[University of South Australia|South Australian School of Art]]. (The latter moved to a campus in [[Underdale, South Australia|Underdale]].)

NASA was dedicated to practical studio-based studies in [[visual art]], providing training in studio areas, such as [[Photography]] and [[Digital Art]], [[ceramic art|ceramics]], [[sculpture]], [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[printmaking]], [[jewellery]] and [[textiles]].&lt;ref name="TAFE ACArts History" /&gt;

==Notable alumni==
;Acting
*[[Kate Kendall]], actor, best known for her long-running role as "Angie Piper" in the television series ''[[Stingers]]''. (Alumna of the Centre for Performing Arts.)
*[[Nathan Page]], actor, currently starring in ''[[Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Report|url=http://vital.new.voced.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/ngv.../SOURCE2}}{{dead link|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aleksey Danilovich Kivshenko''' (Russian: Алексей Данилович Кившенко; 22 March 1851, [[Venyov]] - 2 October 1895, [[Heidelberg]]) was a Russian painter, primarily of historical scenes. Among the best-known were those depicting the [[History of the Russo-Turkish wars|Russo-Turkish Wars]]. He also created hunting and [[Genre art|genre]] scenes and was associated with the [[Peredvizhniki]].

==Biography==
He was born on a small [[stud farm]]. His father was interested in art and music, so he encouraged his son's early attempts at drawing. His first studies began when he was nine; at the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]] with [[Ivan Kramskoi]].&lt;ref name="P"&gt;[http://www.artsait.ru/art/k/kivshenko/main.htm Brief biography] @ Russian Painting.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1867 to 1877, he was a student at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]], under the direction of [[Kārlis Hūns]].&lt;ref name="R"&gt;[http://www.rusartnet.com/biographies/russian-artists/19th-century/late-19th-century/battle-painter/alexei-kivshenko Biographical notes] @ RusArtNet.&lt;/ref&gt; He also audited classes at the [[Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology|State Institute of Technology]] and the Medico-Surgical Academy, but these were not to his liking. While there, he helped support himself by working as a scribe for the [[Admiralty Board (Russian Empire)|Admiralty Board]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wyrnal.livejournal.com/80504.html Brief biography] @ LiveJournal.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, after receiving a foreign fellowship, he began to travel extensively, visiting Paris, [[Düsseldorf]] and Munich, where he worked with [[Gabriel von Max]] and [[Wilhelm von Diez]].&lt;ref name="R" /&gt;  When he returned in 1884, the paintings he had produced earned him the title of "Academician". Later that year, he was commissioned by Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] to create scenes from the recent [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turkish War]], so he went to [[Caucasus Viceroyalty (1801–1917)|Transcaucasia]] to make sketches. He also taught drawing at the [[Saint Petersburg Art and Industry Academy]] until 1889.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt;

In 1891, he accompanied [[Nikodim Kondakov]] on an archaeological expedition to Palestine and Syria, returning with numerous sketches of everyday life in the region, as well as the ancient buildings.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt; Many of these were used as book decorations. In 1893, he became a full member of the Academy and taught a class in battle painting.&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; He died of undisclosed causes during a visit to Germany.

'''Sir Andrew John Wiles''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|KBE|FRS}} (born 11 April 1953)&lt;ref name="whoswho"/&gt; is a British mathematician and a [[Royal Society]] Research Professor at the [[University of Oxford]], specialising in [[number theory]]. He is best known for [[Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem|proving]] [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], for which he was awarded the 2016 [[Abel Prize]]&lt;ref name = "Abel"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abelprisen.no/c67110/binfil/download.php?tid=67059 |title=The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters has decided to award the Abel Prize for 2016 to Sir Andrew J.

==Education and early life==
Wiles was born on 11 April &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://famous-mathematicians.com/andrew-wiles/|title=Andrew Wiles|website=famous-mathematicians.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1953 in [[Cambridge, England|Cambridge]], England, the son of [[Maurice Wiles|Maurice Frank Wiles]] (1923–2005), the [[Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford]],&lt;ref name="whoswho"/&gt; and Patricia Wiles (née Mowll). His father worked as the Chaplain at [[Ridley Hall, Cambridge]], for the years 1952–55. Wiles attended King's College School, Cambridge, and [[The Leys School, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cambridge-born mathematician awarded top prize for solving centuries-old numerical problem|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/cambridge-born-mathematician-awarded-prize/story-28927992-detail/story.html|accessdate=16 March 2016|publisher=[[Cambridge News]]}}{{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiles states that he came across Fermat's Last Theorem on his way home from school when he was 10 years old. He stopped at his local library where he found a book about the theorem.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; Fascinated by the existence of a theorem that was so easy to state that he, a ten-year-old, could understand it, but that no one had proven, he decided to be the first person to prove it. However, he soon realised that his knowledge was too limited, so he abandoned his childhood dream, until it was brought back to his attention at the age of 33 by [[Ken Ribet]]'s 1986 proof of the [[epsilon conjecture]], which [[Gerhard Frey]] had previously linked to Fermat's famous equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chang|first1=Sooyoung|title=Academic Genealogy of Mathematicians|date=2011|isbn=9789814282291|page=207|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4siw31DPONUC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and research==
Wiles earned his [[bachelor's degree]] in [[mathematics]] in 1974 at [[Merton College, Oxford]], and a PhD in 1980 as a graduate student of [[Clare College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=wphd&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Cambridge|title=Reciprocity laws and the conjecture of birch and swinnerton-dyer|first= Andrew John|last=Wiles|date=1978|url=http://ulmss-newton.lib.cam.ac.uk/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=15254|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.477263}}|website=lib.cam.ac.uk|oclc=500589130}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a stay at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] in 1981, Wiles became a [[Princeton University Department of Mathematics|Professor of Mathematics]] at [[Princeton University]]. In 1985–86, Wiles was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] at the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques]] near Paris and at the [[École Normale Supérieure]]. From 1988 to 1990, Wiles was a [[Royal Society]] Research Professor at the [[University of Oxford]], and then he returned to Princeton. From 1994 - 2009, Wiles was a [[Eugene Higgins Professor]] at Princeton. He rejoined Oxford in 2011 as Royal Society Research Professor.&lt;ref name=andrew&gt;{{cite web|first1=John J.|last1=O'Connor|first2=Edmund F.|last2=Robertson|title=Wiles Biography|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Wiles.html|publisher=[[MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]]|date=September 2009|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2018 he was appointed [[Regius Professor]] of Mathematics at Oxford, the first in the university's history.&lt;ref name="RProf"/&gt; 

Wiles's graduate research was guided by [[John Coates (mathematician)|John Coates]] beginning in the summer of 1975. Together these colleagues worked on the arithmetic of [[elliptic curve]]s with [[complex multiplication]] by the methods of [[Iwasawa theory]]. He further worked with [[Barry Mazur]] on the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory over the [[rational number]]s, and soon afterward, he generalised this result to [[totally real field]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andrew Wiles|url=http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/members/3001745.html|publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]]|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His biographical page at Princeton University's website states that "Andrew has few equals in terms of his impact on modern number theory. Many of the world’s very best young number theorists received their Ph.D.’s under Andrew ... and many of these are today leaders and professors at top institutions around the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dof.princeton.edu/about/clerk-faculty/emeritus/andrew-john-wiles|title=Andrew John Wiles - Dean of the Faculty|website=dof.princeton.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem===
{{main|Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem}}
Starting in mid-1986, based on successive progress of the previous few years of [[Gerhard Frey]], [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and [[Ken Ribet]], it became clear that [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] could be proven as a corollary of a limited form of the [[modularity theorem]] (unproven at the time and then known as the "Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture"). The modularity theorem involved elliptic curves, which was also Wiles's own specialist area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Peter|title=How Math's Most Famous Proof Nearly Broke|url=http://nautil.us/issue/24/error/how-maths-most-famous-proof-nearly-broke|publisher=Nautilus|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conjecture was seen by contemporary mathematicians as important, but extraordinarily difficult or perhaps impossible to prove.&lt;ref name="Singh"&gt;[[Simon Singh]] (1997). ''Fermat's Last Theorem''. {{ISBN|1-85702-521-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|203–205, 223, 226}} For example, Wiles's ex-supervisor [[John H. Coates|John Coates]] states that it seemed "impossible to actually prove",&lt;ref name="Singh" /&gt;{{rp|226}} and [[Ken Ribet]] considered himself "one of the vast majority of people who believed [it] was completely inaccessible", adding that "Andrew Wiles was probably one of the few people on earth who had the audacity to dream that you can actually go and prove [it]."&lt;ref name="Singh"/&gt;{{rp|223}}

Despite this, Wiles, with his from-childhood fascination with Fermat's Last Theorem, decided to undertake the challenge of proving the conjecture, at least to the extent needed for [[Frey's elliptic curve|Frey's curve]].&lt;ref name="Singh" /&gt;{{rp|226}} He dedicated all of his research time to this problem for over six years in near-total secrecy, covering up his efforts by releasing prior work in small segments as separate papers and confiding only in his wife.&lt;ref name="Singh" /&gt;{{rp|229–230}}

In June 1993, he presented his proof to the public for the first time at a conference in Cambridge.
{{quote|He gave a lecture a day on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday with the title 'Modular Forms, Elliptic Curves and Galois Representations.' There was no hint in the title that Fermat's last theorem would be discussed, Dr. Ribet said. ... Finally, at the end of his third lecture, Dr. Wiles concluded that he had proved a general case of the Taniyama conjecture. Then, seemingly as an afterthought, he noted that that meant that Fermat's last theorem was true. Q.E.D.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|last=Kolata|first=Gina|title=At Last, Shout of 'Eureka!' In Age-Old Math Mystery|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/24/us/at-last-shout-of-eureka-in-age-old-math-mystery.html|accessdate=21 January 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=24 June 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In August 1993, it was discovered that the proof contained a flaw in one area. Wiles tried and failed for over a year to repair his proof. According to Wiles, the crucial idea for circumventing, rather than closing this area, came to him on 19 September 1994, when he was on the verge of giving up. Together with his former student [[Richard Taylor (mathematician)|Richard Taylor]], he published a second paper which circumvented the problem and thus completed the proof. Both papers were published in May 1995 in a dedicated issue of the ''[[Annals of Mathematics]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiles|first=Andrew|date=May 1995|title=Issue 3|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/i310703|journal=Annals of Mathematics|volume=141|pages=1-551|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are mathematicians finally satisfied with Andrew Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem?

Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem has stood up to the scrutiny of the world's other mathematical experts. Wiles was interviewed for an episode of the [[BBC]] documentary series ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]''&lt;ref name="horizon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074rxx |title=BBC TWO, Horizon Fermat's Last Theorem |publisher=BBC |date=16 December 2010 |accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that focused on Fermat's Last Theorem. This was renamed "The Proof", and it was made an episode of the US [[Public Broadcasting Service]]'s science television series ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]''.&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/andrew-wiles-fermat.html|title=Andrew Wiles on Solving Fermat|publisher=[[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work and life are also described in great detail in [[Simon Singh]]'s popular book ''[[Fermat's Last Theorem (book)|Fermat's Last Theorem]]''.

Wiles's 1987 certificate of election to the [[Royal Society]] reads:
{{Block quote|Andrew Wiles is almost unique amongst number-theorists in his ability to bring to bear new tools and new ideas on some of the most intractable problems of number theory. His finest achievement to date has been his proof, in joint work with [[Barry Mazur|Mazur]], of the "main conjecture" of Iwasawa theory for cyclotomic extensions of the rational field. This work settles many of the basic problems on [[cyclotomic field]]s which go back to Kummer, and is unquestionably one of the major advances in number theory in our times. Earlier he did deep work on the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer for elliptic curves with complex multiplication – one offshoot of this was his proof of an unexpected and beautiful generalisation of the classical explicit reciprocity laws of Artin–Hasse–Iwasawa. Most recently, he has made new progress on the construction of l-adic representations attached to Hilbert modular forms, and has applied these to prove the "main conjecture" for cyclotomic extensions of totally real fields – again a remarkable result since none of the classical tools of cyclotomic fields applied to these problems.&lt;ref name="royal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqCmd=show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=(RefNo==%27EC%2F1989%2F39%27) |title = EC/1989/39: Wiles, Sir Andrew John |publisher=[[The Royal Society]]|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''''Annunciation''''' is a panel-painting [[altarpiece]] or [[retable]] by [[Fra Angelico]] ([[tempera]] on panel, 154x194 cm the central panel, 194x194 including the [[predella]]) situated in the [[Museo del Prado]] of [[Madrid]] and created between the thirties of the 15th century. The work is probably the third of a series of great tables by Angelico representing the [[Annunciation]]; the other two are the ''[[Annunciation of Cortona]]'' and the ''[[Annunciation of San Giovanni Valdarno]]''. Dating is not concordant and some art historians invert the sequence putting the Prado table at first.

== History ==
The work has been painted in the [[Convent of San Domenico, Fiesole]], where Angelico himself lived as a friar, and it was one of his biggest altarpiece in the church, with the [[Fiesole Altarpiece|main altarpiece]] on the high altar (the oldest one, 1424–25, and the only one still in the convent) and the ''[[Coronation of the Virgin (Fra Angelico, Louvre)|Coronation of the Virgin]]'' in [[Louvre]] (1424-1435 circa).

The altarpiece was completed in 1435, when the works on the convent ended. After being sold, it became part of the royal collections of the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarchy]] before moving to Prado.

== Description ==
[[File:Angelico,_dettaglio_vergine.JPG|thumb|The Vergin (detail)]]
The scenes have a structure similar to the other two Annunciations but with some differences. As in the Annunciation of Cortona, the pictured surface is divided in three parts (the garden, the Angel's arch and the Virgin's arch), but the [[vanishing point]] is inside the home and not outside, like the [[Annunciation of San Giovanni Valdarno|Annunciation of San Giovanni]], focusing the viewer's attention on the Annunciation. Due to this scheme, the scene of [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] expelled from [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] could result less evident (in the Cortonese one they are near the vanishing point)  if Angelico didn't increased considerably their figures.[[Image:Fra Angelico 096.jpg|thumb|Detail: ''Adam and Eve hunted out of Paradise'' "walking on the roses of the garden of Mary"|left]]As in the other two works, they are moving in a flowered garden representing the virginity of Mary ("[[hortus conclusus]]"), inhabited by a multitude of plants and seedlings painted with great accuracy. Between the species with symbolic values, we can recognise the palm, representing the future martyrdom of Christ, and the red roses referring the blood of the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]]. The presence of Adam and Eve evidences the cycle of the human damnation, recomposed with the deliverance in Christ made possible by the accept of Mary.

From the high-left a ray of divine light illuminates, through the dove of [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]], the Virgin, who bends accepting his duty submissively. She's sitting on a seat covered with a rich drape acting as carpet too, and she has on her knees an open book, symbol of the happening Scriptures.

The Angel has a similar pose and vest to the work of San Giovanni, even if his figure appears more static and the folds of the vest are more schematic, maybe due to the brush strokes of a collaborator.

The scene is set under a renaissance portico with the light arches stretched with wisdom on [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], which remember the architecture of [[Michelozzo]]. Light appears unified, unlike the pail of Cortona, and moves from left to right for all the element.

The overall effect is of a precious description of the various details, with cold and bright colours, almost crystallized, in the changing colour harmonies of blue and pink.

== Predella ==
In the [[predella]] there are five scenes from Mary's life ( ''Birth and Marriage'', the ''Visitation'', the ''Adoration of the Magi'',  ''Presentation at the temple'' and the ''dormition'') where the master had worked freely on the composition, less subjected to the iconographic tradition of the main scene.

The ''Sposalizio'' presents the background of a Renaissance church with portico, while the visitation shows a sidelong lodge, represented with ability. This scene does not reach the vivid expression of fatigue on the woman who is going to the chime as in the predella of the ''[[Annunciation of Cortona]]''. The ''Adoration of the Magi'' instead is completely original and shows an innovative frontal iconography years before the revolution of [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] (''[[Adoration of the Magi (Botticelli, 1475)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' in the [[Uffizi]], 1475), enhanced by the complex perspective of the hut's ruins. Here can be noticed the distinct use of lights by Beato Angelico, who creates a pure and crystal illumination which models volumes, enhances the chromatic harmony and unifies the scenes.

The following scene of the ''Presentation'' is more innovative, with the ambient placed inside a circular temple which seems projected through lens to the viewer, improving the scheme already used on the ''[[Presentation at the Temple (Gentile da Fabriano)|Presentation at the Temple]]'' by [[Gentile da Fabriano]]. The ''Dormition'' is the most traditional scene though the invention of the avvallamento between the background mountains can be considered innovative, because it creates a perspective channel to the holy way suspended by the Angels on the top.

'''Art competitions''' were held as part of the '''[[1932 Summer Olympics]]''' in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[United States]].  Medals were awarded in five categories ([[architecture]], [[literature]], [[music]], [[painting]], and [[sculpture]]), for works inspired by sport-related themes.

[[Art competitions at the Summer Olympics|Art competitions]] were part of the Olympic program from 1912 to 1948, but were discontinued due to concerns about amateurism and professionalism.  Since 1952, a non-competitive art and cultural festival has been associated with each Games.

'''Bazar square''' ({{lang-az|Bazar meydanı}}) or '''Khanqah complex''' ({{lang-az|Xanəgah kompleksi}}) is a historic religious-architectural complex with [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] of XII-XIII centuries. It is a part of [[Old City (Baku)|Old City]] and located on Kichik Gala street, in the city of [[Baku]], in [[Azerbaijan]]. It was also registered as a national architectural monument by the decision of the [[Cabinet of Azerbaijan|Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan]] dated August 2, 2001, No. 132.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azərbaycan Respublikası ərazisində dövlət mühafizəsinə götürülmüş daşınmaz tarix və mədəniyyət abidələrinin əhəmiyyət dərəcələrinə görə bölgüsünün təsdiq edilməsi haqqında Azərbaycan Respublikası Nazirlər Kabinetinin qərarı|url=http://www.e-qanun.az/framework/2847|website=e-qanun.az|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex was discovered during archeological excavations carried out in 1964 on the northern side of the [[Maiden Tower (Baku)|Maiden Tower]].&lt;ref name="icherisheher"&gt;{{cite web|title= BAZAR MEYDANI (Sıratağlı dini-memarlıq kompleksi)|url= http://www.icherisheher.gov.az/static,20/lang,az/#monument32|publisher= icherisheher.gov.az|language= az|accessdate= March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="icherisheheraz"&gt;{{cite web|title= SIRATAĞLI DİNİ – MEMARLIQ KOMPLEKSİ|url= http://www.icherisheher.az/az/61-sirataghli-religious-architectural-complex|publisher= icherisheher.az|language= az|accessdate= March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
==Structure==
The structure of the monument is similar to [[Great Mosque of Mecca|Al-Masjid Al-Ḥarām]] for its coverage with pavement and arcades. 52 graves were discovered in the area as a result of the archaeological excavations. Most of the graves are specially preserved. Graves in the territory of the monument and under the arches are believed to be belonging to those deceased persons. According to Islamic traditions, some people bequeathed to be buried in sacred places. When the sacred place was too far away, the person was buried in nearby places. The found cultural monuments and graves reflects opinions of the archaeologist, which means the place was once a pilgrimage.&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icherisheherazz"&gt;{{cite web|title= Bazar Meydanı (Sıratağlı dini-memarlıq kompleksi)|url= http://www.icherisheher.az/az/56-other-monuments|publisher= icherisheher.az|language= az|accessdate= March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the yard, near the graves, a cylindrical well and at a certain distance, on south-eastern side, a large eight-pointed column were discovered. The column stands on a three-tiered pavement, which was built of stone. Its height is 1.31 meters and thickness is 48&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icherisheherazz"/&gt;

'''BlueLabel''' is an online database for the international [[art world]]. BlueLabel was developed for [[Modern art|modern]] and [[Contemporary art|contemporary]] artists to record details of their [[art|art work]]s to ensure that these are permanently stored and easily accessible.

Art works are more valuable when fully documented&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artbusiness.com/estateplan.html&lt;/ref&gt; but modern technology may increase the chances for data loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainmentstorage.org/articles/Hard%20Disk%20Drives_%20The%20Good,%20The%20Bad%20and%20The%20Ugly.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425132930/http://entertainmentstorage.org/articles/Hard%20Disk%20Drives_%20The%20Good%2C%20The%20Bad%20and%20The%20Ugly.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; BlueLabel caters to all members of the international art world and allows artists to securely register the details of their artwork online to prevent loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluelabel.net |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425132754/http://bluelabel.net/ |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists create “labels” for their works – online documents that detail all of the essential information for the work. These labels can then be accessed by members and non-members, sent, collected and managed.

Unlike other art archives, BlueLabel is artist driven and guarantees the authenticity of its contents by the very nature of its design.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.basenow.net/2009/07/16/bluelabel-revolutionizes-the-art-world%E2%80%94through-order-god-forbid/&lt;/ref&gt;

The data entry system complies with advanced, international [[Archiving|archival]] standards; it is a relevant tool not only for conventional media such as [[painting]] and [[sculpture]] but also for [[New media art|new media]] practices and alternative contemporary art forms such as film, video, performance, internet art and site-specific art.

'''Development'''

BlueLabel was founded by Anne Faggionato in 2009. The website is currently undergoing a period of significant redevelopment. 

'''Sponsorship'''

In 2010, BlueLabel sponsored New York Gallery Week&lt;ref&gt;http://newyorkgalleryweek.com/2010/&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] exhibition at [[Serpentine Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.serpentinegallery.org/2010/04/richard_hamilton23_february_18.html&lt;/ref&gt;
BlueLabel also sponsored a show curated by [http://www.williammackrell.com/ William Mackrell] exclusively from BlueLabel members, ''A Tender Cut''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artslant.com/lon/events/show/109398-a-tender-cut&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, BlueLabel again sponsored New York Gallery Week&lt;ref&gt;http://newyorkgalleryweek.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and also sponsored ''In Deed: Certificates of Authenticity in Art'' (a traveling exhibition, opening at The Foundation for Visual Arts, Middelburg), an exhibition that looks at artists’ certificates  from the past 50 years and how their roles have shifted and developed.&lt;ref&gt;http://vleeshal.nl/tentoonstellingen/in-deed-certificates-of-authenticity-in-art&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Borf''' was a [[graffiti]] campaign seen in and around [[Washington, D.C.]] during 2004 and 2005, carried out by John Tsombikos while studying at the [[Corcoran College of Art and Design]]. This four letter word was ubiquitous around the [[Washington, D.C. (northwest)|Northwest]] quadrant of Washington, and ranged from simple tagging to complete sentences to two-color stencils to the massive defacement on an overhead exit sign from the [[Theodore Roosevelt Bridge]] to [[Constitution Avenue]].&lt;ref name="Constitution"&gt;{{cite web

One of the most visible tags was the "BUSH HATES BORF" message painted above other graffiti on the back wall of the Vision Lighting Building and visible from the [[Red Line (Washington Metro)|Metro Red Line]] near the [[Takoma station|Takoma Metro station]]. This message was later replaced by a message saying "OBAMA HATES BORF" in early 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ggwash.org/view/11799/obama-hates-borf-buffed-from-the-red-line |title="Obama hates BORF" buffed from the Red Line|publisher=Greater Greater Washington|author= John Muller |date=2012-02-08|accessdate=2009-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The graffiti was also reported to have appeared in [[New York City]], [[San Francisco]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcist.com/archives/2005/04/13/borf_on_the_wes.php |title=Borf on the West Coast? |publisher=Dcist.com |date=2005-04-13 |accessdate=2009-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407131425/http://www.dcist.com/archives/2005/04/13/borf_on_the_wes.php |archivedate=2007-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raleigh, North Carolina]],&lt;ref name="Sung 1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Ellen Sung |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/928/story/324689.html |title='Borf' is watching us, |publisher=Raleigh News &amp; Observer |date= |accessdate=2009-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022205254/http://www.newsobserver.com/928/story/324689.html |archivedate=October 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sung 2"&gt;{{cite news|author=Ellen Sung |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/928/story/230481.html |title=Arrest may end artist's spree |publisher=Raleigh News &amp; Observer |date= |accessdate=2009-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022205249/http://www.newsobserver.com/928/story/230481.html |archivedate=October 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rome, Italy]],&lt;ref name="Rome"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcist.com/archives/2005/09/07/the_borf_saga_c.php |title=The Borf Saga Continues...

In 2009, director Paris Bustillos created a documentary film about the campaign entitled ''Borf!''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphoppress.com/2009/03/borf-and-chocolate-city-burning-a-private-screening-of-two-films-documenting-graffiti-culture-in-was.html |title=Borf! and Chocolate City Burning |publisher=hiphoppress.com | date=2009-03-16 |accessdate=2009-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
The campaign attracted widespread attention without first explaining its motivations. According to Tsombikos and subsequent Borf communiqués, both the nickname "Borf" and the Borf face belonged to Bobby Fisher, a close friend of Tsombikos' who had committed suicide.&lt;ref name="libsyn1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dissonance.libsyn.com/ |title=Borf Brigade interview on Dissonance Radio |publisher=Dissonance.libsyn.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a video shown on July 29, 2006, the Borf Brigade – the group claiming responsibility for the graffiti spree – asserted that capitalism and the culture of aesthetics created alienation and feelings of worthlessness that contributed to the 16-year-old's suicide. The group said that they used other peoples' property to commemorate and pay homage to their deceased friend. The graffiti usually had overtones of anti-authority sentiments and [[Youth Rights|youth liberation]].&lt;ref name="Communique"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court appearance==
Approximately four months after his arrest, Tsombikos appeared before the [[Superior Court of the District of Columbia]]. His paint-stained coat, which resembled one that he wore in [[Libby Copeland]]'s July 14 ''[[Washington Post]]'' article (published after his arrest), was declared evidence by the judge and handed over to the prosecution.

On December 12, 2005, Tsombikos agreed to plead guilty to one count of felony destruction of property. He also agreed to perform community service (cleaning up graffiti) and to pay $12,000 in restitution. Judge Leibovitz ordered him to stay out of the District except for court appearances and classes at the [[Corcoran College of Art and Design]].

On February 9, 2006, Tsombikos was sentenced to 30 days in the D.C. jail, with an additional 17 months suspended, as well as the community service and restitution specified in his plea agreement. At his sentencing, the judge said, "You profess to despise rich people. You profess to despise the faceless, nameless forms of government that oppress. That's what you've become. That's what you are. You're a rich kid who comes into Washington and defaces property because you feel like it. It's not fair. It's not right."&lt;ref name="Sentencing"&gt;{{cite news

==Communiqués==
{{BLP sources section|date=July 2007}}
At a [[Dupont Circle]] event after Borf's arrest, young people distributed spray paint and anarchist pamphlets.&lt;ref name="Borf-In"&gt;[http://www.dcist.com/archives/2005/07/24/a_borf-in_at_du.php "A Borf-in at Dupont Circle", DCist.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019085916/http://www.dcist.com/archives/2005/07/24/a_borf-in_at_du.php |date=October 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following was distributed as a "communiqué" at the event:

{{quote|Borf is not caught. Borf is many. Borf is none. Borf is waiting for you in your car. Borf is in your pockets. Borf is running through your veins. Borf is naive. Borf is good for your liver. Borf is controlling your thoughts. Borf is everywhere. Borf is the war on boredom. Borf annihilates. Borf hates school. Borf is a four letter word for joy. Borf is quickly losing patience. Borf yells in the library. Borf eats pieces of shit like you for breakfast. Borf is digging a hole to China. Borf is bad at graffiti. Borf is ephemeral. Borf is invincible. Borf.

Borf ain’t nothin’ to fuck with. Borf runs it. Borf has reflexes like a cat. Borf is immortal. Borf sticks gum under the desk. Borf is omnipotent. Borf is flawed. Borf is winning.}}

On July 29, 2006, a group of young people calling themselves the "Borf Brigade" held a march in the [[Shaw, Washington, D.C.|Shaw]] neighborhood of Washington, and projected a "video communiqué" on a wall in which a young woman wearing a [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]]-style face mask read a statement labeling Tsombikos a "minor Borfist" and announced that he had been "purged" from the group.&lt;ref name="Communique" /&gt; The video also said,

{{quote|On October 22, 2003, our friend Borf hanged himself from a basement pipe in a suburb of the nation's capital. This was not a solitary act. Over 30,000 people in the U.S. alone fall victim to this conspiratorial violence. It is the third leading killer of young people ages 15-24, and outnumbers homicides 3 to 2. This epidemic cannot be medicated into remission. It is not a problem confined to our family bloodline. "Trouble at home" is not the only trigger for depression.}}

==Consolation of Ruin art show==
[[File:Bobby Fisher Memorial Building tag.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Borf piece on the side of the Bobby Fisher Memorial Building in Washington, D.C.]]
In April 2007, wheat-pasted posters announcing a "BORF SHOW" slated for the weekends of May 18–20 and May 25–27 began appearing around Washington. The location was "The Bobby Fisher Memorial Building" at 1644 North Capitol Street NW.&lt;ref name="libsyn1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://borfyou.com/ |title=Borfyou.com |publisher=Borfyou.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WP Borf"&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show, entitled "Consolation of Ruin" and sponsored by [[philanthropist]] Chuck Burgundy,{{citation needed|date=June 2009}} featured two floors of oil paintings, screen prints, etchings, installations, and video, all for sale in an effort to pay for Tsombikos' $12,000 restitution. One installation (a direct reference to Banksy's "[[elephant in the room]]" piece) was of a male figure hanging from a belt from the ceiling and painted to match the wallpaper designs on the wall, camouflaging the lifeless figure. A number of the original stencils used in the graffiti campaign were on display.&lt;ref name="Indymedia Show"&gt;{{cite news

After the Borf show, the Bobby Fisher Memorial Building served as a youth-oriented space for music and art until its closing in July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dcist.com/2008/06/26/the_house_that_borf_built_is_closin.php |title=The House That Borf Built is Closing |publisher=DCist |date=2008-06-26 |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081102213533/http://dcist.com/2008/06/26/the_house_that_borf_built_is_closin.php |archivedate=2008-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Collage''' (from the {{lang-fr| coller}}, "to glue";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcollagedenise.com%2Fpage2.html&amp;date=2012-04-12 |url=http://collagedenise.com/page2.html |archivedate=2012-04-12 |title=Origin of the term "collage" |first=Denise |last=Enslen}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|kɔ.laʒ}}) is a technique of an art production, primarily used in the [[visual arts]], where the artwork is made from an [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]] of different forms, thus creating a new whole.

A collage may sometimes include [[Clipping (publications)|magazine and newspaper clippings]], [[ribbon]]s, [[paint]], bits of colored or handmade papers, portions of other artwork or texts, [[photograph]]s and other [[found object]]s, glued to a piece of paper or canvas. The origins of collage can be traced back hundreds of years, but this technique made a dramatic reappearance in the early 20th century as an [[art]] form of novelty.

The term ''collage'' was coined by both [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] in the beginning of the 20th century when collage became a distinctive part of [[modern art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/collage.html ''Collage'', essay by [[Clement Greenberg]]] Retrieved July 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early precedents===
Techniques of collage were first used at the time of the [[Papermaking|invention of paper]] in [[China]], around 200 BC. The use of collage, however, wasn't used by many people until the 10th century in [[Japan]], when [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphers]] began to apply glued paper, using texts on surfaces, when writing their [[poem]]s.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt; The technique of collage appeared in [[medieval Europe]] during the 13th century. [[Gold leaf]] panels started to be applied in [[Gothic cathedrals]] around the 15th and 16th centuries. [[Gemstone]]s and other [[precious metal]]s were applied to religious images, [[icon]]s, and also, to [[coats of arms]].&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt; An 18th-century example of collage art can be found in the work of [[Mary Delany]]. In the 19th century, collage methods also were used among hobbyists for [[memorabilia]] (e.g. applied to [[photo albums]]) and books (e.g. [[Hans Christian Andersen]], [[Carl Spitzweg]]).&lt;ref name="Origins"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leland|first=Nita|authorlink=|author2=Virginia Lee Williams|editor=|others=|title=Creative Collage Techniques|origyear=|url=|format=|accessdate=|date=September 1994|publisher=North Light Books|isbn=0-89134-563-9|pages=7|chapter=One}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many institutions have attributed the beginnings of the practice of collage to Picasso and Braque in 1912, however, early Victorian photocollage suggest collage techniques were practiced in the early 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/VictPhotoColl/overview&lt;/ref&gt; Many institutions recognize these works as memorabilia for hobbyists, though they functioned as a facilitator of Victorian aristocratic collective portraiture, proof of female erudition, and presented a new mode of artistic representation that questioned the way in which photography is truthful. In 2009, curator Elizabeth Siegel organized the exhibition: ''Playing with Pictures'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/VictPhotoColl/overview Art Institute of Chicago, Playing with Pictures]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Art Institute of Chicago|the Art Institute Chicago]] to acknowledge collage works by [[Alexandra of Denmark]] and [[Mary Georgina Filmer]] among others. The exhibition later traveled to [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and [[Art Gallery of Ontario|The Art Gallery of Ontario]].

===Collage and modernism===

Despite the pre-twentieth-century use of collage-like application techniques, some art authorities argue that collage, properly speaking, did not emerge until after 1900, in conjunction with the early stages of modernism.

For example, the [[Tate Gallery]]'s online art glossary states that collage "was first used as an artists' technique in the twentieth century.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/c/collage "Introduction to collage"]. Tate Gallery website&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]'s online art glossary, collage is an artistic concept associated with the beginnings of modernism, and entails much more than the idea of gluing something onto something else. The glued-on patches which Braque and Picasso added to their canvases offered a new perspective on painting when the patches "collided with the surface plane of the painting."&lt;ref name="guggenheimcollection.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/concept_Collage.html |title=Guggenheimcollection.org |access-date=2008-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218074849/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/concept_Collage.html |archive-date=2008-02-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this perspective, collage was part of a methodical reexamination of the relation between painting and sculpture, and these new works "gave each medium some of the characteristics of the other," according to the Guggenheim essay. Furthermore, these chopped-up bits of newspaper introduced fragments of externally referenced meaning into the collision: "References to current events, such as the war in the Balkans, and to popular culture enriched the content of their art." This juxtaposition of signifiers, "at once serious and tongue-in-cheek," was fundamental to the inspiration behind collage: "Emphasizing concept and process over end product, collage has brought the incongruous into meaningful congress with the ordinary."&lt;ref name="guggenheimcollection.org"/&gt;

===Collage in painting===

Collage in the modernist sense began with [[Cubism|Cubist painters]] [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]. According to some sources, Picasso was the first to use the collage technique in oil paintings. According to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]'s online article about collage, Braque took up the concept of collage itself before Picasso, applying it to charcoal drawings. Picasso adopted collage immediately after (and could be the first to use collage in paintings, as opposed to drawings):

"It was Braque who purchased a roll of simulated oak-grain wallpaper and began cutting out pieces of the paper and attaching them to his charcoal drawings. Picasso immediately began to make his own experiments in the new medium."&lt;ref name="guggenheimcollection.org"/&gt;

In 1912 for his ''Still Life with Chair Caning (Nature-morte à la chaise cannée)'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.musee-picasso.fr/pages/page_id18547_u1l2.htm Nature-morte à la chaise cannée] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305050539/http://www.musee-picasso.fr/pages/page_id18547_u1l2.htm |date=2005-03-05 }}'' - Musée National Picasso Paris&lt;/ref&gt; Picasso pasted a patch of [[oilcloth]] with a chair-cane design onto the canvas of the piece.

[[Surrealism|Surrealist]] artists have made extensive use of collage. [[Cubomania]] is a collage made by cutting an image into squares which are then reassembled [[surrealist automatism|automatically]] or at random. Collages produced using a similar, or perhaps identical, method are called ''[[surrealist techniques#Étrécissements|etrécissements]]'' by [[Marcel Mariën]] from a method first explored by Mariën. [[Surrealist techniques|Surrealist games]] such as ''parallel collage'' use collective techniques of collage making.

The [[Sidney Janis]] [[Art gallery|Gallery]] held an early [[Pop Art]] exhibit called the ''New Realist Exhibition'' in November 1962, which included works by the American artists [[Tom Wesselmann]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Robert Indiana]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], and [[Andy Warhol]]; and Europeans such as [[Arman]], Baj, [[Christo]], [[Yves Klein]], Festa, Rotella, [[Jean Tinguely]], and Schifano. It followed the [[Nouveau Réalisme]] exhibition at the Galerie Rive Droite in [[Paris]], and marked the international debut of the artists who soon gave rise to what came to be called [[Pop Art]] in Britain and The United States and [[Nouveau Réalisme]] on the European continent. Many of these artists used collage techniques in their work.
Wesselmann took part in the ''New Realist'' show with some reservations,&lt;ref&gt;(cf. S. Stealingworth, 1980, p. 31)&lt;/ref&gt; exhibiting two 1962 works: ''Still life #17'' and ''Still life #22''.

Another technique is that of ''canvas collage,'' which is the application, typically with glue, of separately painted [[canvas]] patches to the surface of a painting's main canvas. Well known for use of this technique is British artist [[John Walker (painter)|John Walker]] in his [[paintings]] of the late 1970s, but canvas collage was already an integral part of the [[mixed media]] works of such American artists as [[Conrad Marca-Relli]] and [[Jane Frank]] by the early 1960s. The intensely self-critical [[Lee Krasner]] also frequently destroyed her own paintings by cutting them into pieces, only to create new works of art by reassembling the pieces into collages.

===Collage with wood===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dove The Intellectual.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Arthur Dove]], ''The Intellectual'' (1925), collection: [[Museum of Modern Art]] NYC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A1602&amp;page_number=5&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 MoMA]&lt;/ref&gt; part of a series of experimental collages.]] --&gt;
[[File:Jane Frank Plum Pt thumb.jpg|thumb|200px|What may be called '''wood collage''' is the dominant feature in this 1964 [[mixed media]] painting by [[Jane Frank]] (1918–1986)]] The '''wood collage''' is a type that emerged somewhat later than paper collage. [[Kurt Schwitters]] began experimenting with wood collages in the 1920s after already having given up painting for paper collages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030518223503/http://www.kurt-schwitters.org/p,2650057,1.html Kurt-schwitters.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of wood collage is clearly established at least as early as his 'Merz Picture with Candle', dating from the mid to late 1920s.

In a sense, wood collage made its debut indirectly at the same time as paper collage, since according to the Guggenheim online, [[Georges Braque]] initiated use of paper collage by cutting out pieces of simulated oak-grain wallpaper and attaching them to his own charcoal drawings.&lt;ref name="guggenheimcollection.org"/&gt; Thus, the idea of gluing wood to a picture was implicit from the start, since the paper used was a commercial product manufactured to look like wood.

It was during a fifteen-year period of intense experimentation beginning in the mid-1940s that [[Louise Nevelson]] evolved her [[sculpture|sculptural]] wood collages, assembled from found scraps, including parts of [[furniture]], pieces of wooden crates or barrels, and architectural remnants like stair railings or moldings. Generally rectangular, very large, and painted black, they resemble gigantic paintings. Concerning Nevelson's ''Sky Cathedral'' (1958), the [[Museum of Modern Art]] catalogue states, "As a rectangular plane to be viewed from the front, ''Sky Cathedral'' has the pictorial quality of a painting..."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://12.172.4.131/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A4278&amp;page_number=1&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 Louise Nevelson]'' - [[The Museum of Modern Art]], MoMA Highlights, New York: The Museum of Modern Art, revised 2004, originally published 1999, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Yet such pieces also present themselves as massive walls or monoliths, which can sometimes be viewed from either side, or even looked ''through''.

Much wood collage art is considerably smaller in scale, framed and hung as a [[painting]] would be. It usually features pieces of wood, wood shavings, or scraps, assembled on a canvas (if there is painting involved), or on a wooden board. Such framed, picture-like, wood-[[relief]] collages offer the artist an opportunity to explore the qualities of depth, natural color, and [[texture (visual arts)|textural]] variety inherent in the material, while drawing on and taking advantage of the language, conventions, and historical resonances that arise from the tradition of creating pictures to hang on walls. The technique of wood collage is also sometimes combined with painting and other media in a single work of art.

Frequently, what is called "wood collage art" uses only natural wood - such as [[driftwood]], or parts of found and unaltered logs, branches, sticks, or bark. This raises the question of whether such artwork is collage (in the original sense) at all (see [[Collage#Collage and modernism|Collage and modernism]]). This is because the early, paper collages were generally made from bits of text or pictures - things originally made by people, and functioning or signifying in some cultural context. The collage brings these still-recognizable "[[sign (semiotics)|signifier]]s" (or fragments of signifiers) together, in a kind of [[semiotic]] collision. A truncated wooden chair or staircase [[newel]] used in a Nevelson work can also be considered a potential element of collage in the same sense: it had some original, culturally determined context. Unaltered, natural wood, such as one might find on a forest floor, arguably has no such context; therefore, the characteristic contextual disruptions associated with the collage idea, as it originated with Braque and Picasso, cannot really take place. ([[Driftwood]] is of course sometimes ambiguous: while a piece of driftwood may once have been a piece of worked wood - for example, part of a ship - it may be so weathered by salt and sea that its past functional identity is nearly or completely obscured.)

===Decoupage===
[[File:Blue Nudes Henri Matisse.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[Blue Nude II]],'' 1952, [[gouache]] [[decoupage|découpée]], [[Pompidou Centre]], Paris]]
{{Main|Decoupage}}
Decoupage is a type of collage usually defined as a [[craft]]. It is the process of placing a picture into an object for [[beauty|decoration]]. Decoupage can involve adding multiple copies of the same image, cut and layered to add apparent depth. The picture is often coated with varnish or some other sealant for protection.

In the early part of the 20th century, decoupage, like many other art methods, began experimenting with a less realistic and more abstract style. 20th-century artists who produced decoupage works include [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]]. The most famous decoupage work is Matisse's [[Blue Nude II]].

There are many varieties on the traditional technique involving purpose made 'glue' requiring fewer layers (often 5 or 20, depending on the amount of paper involved). Cutouts are also applied under glass or raised to give a three-dimensional appearance according to the desire of the [[decouper]]. Currently decoupage is a popular [[handicraft]].

The craft became known as découpage in [[France]] (from the verb ''découper'', 'to cut out') as it attained great popularity during the 17th and 18th centuries. Many advanced techniques were developed during this time, and items could take up to a year to complete due to the many coats and sandings applied. Some famous or aristocratic practitioners included [[Marie Antoinette]], [[Madame de Pompadour]], and [[Beau Brummell]]. In fact the majority of decoupage enthusiasts attribute the beginning of decoupage to 17th century [[Venice]]. However it was known before this time in [[Asia]].

The most likely origin of decoupage is thought to be [[East Siberia]]n [[funerary art]]. [[Nomad]]ic tribes would use cut out felts to decorate the tombs of their deceased. From Siberia, the practice came to [[China]], and by the 12th century, cut out paper was being used to decorate lanterns, windows, boxes and other objects. In the 17th century, [[Italy]], especially in [[Venice]], was at the forefront of trade with the [[Far East]] and it is generally thought that it is through these trade links that the cut out [[paper]] decorations made their way into [[Europe]].

===Photomontage===
{{Main|Photomontage}}
Collage made from photographs, or parts of photographs, is called photomontage. Photomontage is the process (and result) of making a composite photograph by cutting and joining a number of other photographs. The composite picture was sometimes photographed so that the final image is converted back into a seamless photographic print. The same method is accomplished today using image-editing software. The technique is referred to by professionals as ''compositing''.
[[File:Hamilton-appealing2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]], '' [[Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?]]'' 1956, collage, (one of the earliest works to be considered [[Pop Art]])]]

''[[Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?]]'' was created in 1956 for the catalogue of the ''[[This Is Tomorrow]]'' exhibition in [[London]], [[England]] in which it was reproduced in black and white. In addition, the piece was used in posters for the exhibit.&lt;ref name=tomorrow&gt;[http://www.thisistomorrow2.com/images/cat_1956/cat_web/FrameSet.htm "This is tomorrow"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115063217/http://www.thisistomorrow2.com/images/cat_1956/cat_web/FrameSet.htm |date=2010-01-15 }}, thisistomorrow2.com (scroll to "image 027TT-1956.jpg"). Retrieved 27 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Hamilton has subsequently created several works in which he reworked the subject and composition of the pop art collage, including a 1992 version featuring a female bodybuilder. Many artists have created derivative works of Hamilton's collage. P. C. Helm made a year 2000 interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pchelm.com/computage/just_what_is_it.htm "Just what is it"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121114450/http://www.pchelm.com/computage/just_what_is_it.htm |date=2008-11-21 }}, pchelm.com. Retrieved 27 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods for combining pictures are also called photomontage, such as Victorian "combination printing", the printing from more than one negative on a single piece of printing paper (e.g. [[Oscar Gustave Rejlander|O. G. Rejlander]], 1857), front-projection and computer montage techniques. Much as a collage is composed of multiple facets, artists also combine montage techniques. [[Romare Bearden]]’s (1912–1988) series of black and white "photomontage projections" is an example. His method began with compositions of paper, paint, and photographs put on boards 8½ × 11&amp;nbsp;inches. Bearden fixed the imagery with an emulsion that he then applied with handroller. Subsequently, he enlarged the collages photographically.

The 19th century tradition of physically joining multiple images into a composite and photographing the results prevailed in press photography and [[offset lithography]] until the widespread use of [[digital image editing]]. Contemporary photo editors in magazines now create "paste-ups" digitally.

Creating a photomontage has, for the most part, become easier with the advent of computer software such as [[Adobe Photoshop]], Pixel image editor, and [[GIMP]]. These programs make the changes digitally, allowing for faster workflow and more precise results. They also mitigate mistakes by allowing the artist to "undo" errors. Yet some artists are pushing the boundaries of digital image editing to create extremely time-intensive compositions that rival the demands of the traditional arts. The current trend is to create pictures that combine painting, theatre, illustration and graphics in a seamless photographic whole.

===Digital collage===
Digital collage is the technique of using [[computer]] tools in collage creation to encourage [[Randomness|chance]] associations of disparate visual elements and the subsequent transformation of the visual results through the use of [[electronic media]]. It is commonly used in the creation of [[digital art]].

===Three-dimensional collage===
A 3D collage is the art of putting altogether three-dimensional objects such as rocks, beads, buttons, coins, or even soil to form a new whole or a new object. Examples can include houses, bead circles, etc.

===Mosaic===
It is the art of putting together or assembling of small pieces of paper, tiles, marble, stones, etc. They are often found in cathedrals, churches, temples as a spiritual significance of interior design.Small pieces, normally roughly quadratic, of stone or glass of different colors, known as tesserae, (diminutive tessellae), are used to create a pattern or picture.

===eCollage===
The term "eCollage" (electronic Collage) can be used for a collage created by using computer tools.

==In other contexts==

===In architecture===
Though [[Le Corbusier]] and other architects used techniques that are akin to collage, collage as a theoretical concept only became widely discussed after the publication of ''Collage City'' (1978) by [[Colin Rowe]] and Fred Koetter.

Rowe and Koetter were not, however, championing collage in the pictorial sense, much less seeking the types of disruptions of meaning that occur with collage. Instead, they were looking to challenge the uniformity of [[Modernism]] and saw collage with its [[non-linear]] notion of history as a means to reinvigorate design practice. Not only does historical urban fabric have its place, but in studying it, designers were, so it was hoped, able to get a sense of how better to operate. Rowe was a member of the so-called [[The Texas Rangers (architects)|Texas Rangers]], a group of [[architect]]s who taught at the [[University of Texas]] for a while. Another member of that group was [[Bernhard Hoesli]], a Swiss architect who went on to become an important educator at the [[ETH]]-Zurirch. Whereas for Rowe, collage was more a [[metaphor]] than an actual practice, Hoesli actively made collages as part of his design process. He was close to Robert Slutzky, a New York-based artist, and frequently introduced the question of collage and disruption in his studio work.

===In music===
[[File:Blake, On the Balcony.jpg|thumb|[[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], ''On the Balcony'', 1955–1957, collage, [[mixed-media]], [[Tate Gallery]]]]
{{Main|Sound collage}}
The concept of collage has crossed the boundaries of visual arts. In [[music]], with the advances on recording technology, [[Avant-garde#Avant-garde artists|avant-garde artists]] started experimenting with cutting and pasting since the middle of the twentieth century.

In the 1960s, [[George Martin]] created collages of recordings while producing the records of [[The Beatles]]. In 1967 [[pop art]]ist [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] made the collage for the cover of the Beatles seminal album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. In the 1970s and 1980s, the likes of [[Christian Marclay]] and the group [[Negativland]] reappropriated old audio in new ways. By the 1990s and 2000s, with the popularity of the [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]], it became apparent that "[[sound collage|musical collages]]" had become the norm for [[popular music]], especially in [[rapping|rap]], [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[electronic music]].&lt;ref name="timemagazine"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973092,00.html |title=Play It Again, Sampler |author=Guy Garcia |publisher=[[Time Magazine]] |date=June 1991 |accessdate=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, [[DJ Shadow]] released the groundbreaking album, ''[[Endtroducing.....]]'', made entirely of preexisting recorded material mixed together in audible collage. In the same year, New York City based artist, writer, and musician, Paul D. Miller aka [[DJ Spooky]]'s work pushed the work of sampling into a museum and gallery context as an art practice that combined DJ culture's obsession with archival materials as sound sources on his album ''Songs of a Dead Dreamer'' and in his books ''[http://www.rhythmscience.com Rhythm Science]'' (2004) and ''[http://www.soundunbound.com Sound Unbound]'' (2008) (MIT Press). In his books, "mash-up" and collage based mixes of authors, artists, and musicians such as [[Antonin Artaud]], [[James Joyce]], [[William S. Burroughs]], and [[Raymond Scott]] were featured as part of a what he called "literature of sound." In 2000, [[The Avalanches]] released ''[[Since I Left You]]'', a musical collage consisting of approximately 3,500 musical sources (i.e., samples).&lt;ref name="soundonsound"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov02/articles/avalanches.asp?print=yes |title=The Avalanches |author=Mark Pytlik |publisher=[[Sound on Sound]] |date=November 2006 |accessdate=2007-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206122054/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov02/articles/avalanches.asp?print=yes |archive-date=2012-02-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In illustration===
Collage is commonly used as a technique in [[Picture book|Children's picture book]] [[illustration]]. [[Eric Carle]] is a prominent example, using vividly colored hand-textured papers cut to shape and layered together, sometimes embellished with crayon or other marks. See image at [[The Very Hungry Caterpillar]].

===In artist's books===

Collage is sometimes used alone or in combination with other techniques in [[artists' books]], especially in [[one-off]] unique books rather than as reproduced images in published books.&lt;ref&gt;https://wp.vcu.edu/librarystories/2016/11/03/humphrey-gives-back-by-documenting-book-arts-and-richmond-arts-on-wikipedia/&lt;/ref&gt;

===In literature===
[[Collage novel]]s are books with images selected from other publications and collaged together following a theme or narrative.

The [[bible]] of [[discordianism]], the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', is described by its author as a literary collage. A collage in literary terms may also refer to a layering of ideas or images.

===In fashion design===
Collage is utilized in [[fashion design]] in the sketching process, as part of mixed media illustrations, where drawings together with diverse materials such as paper, photographs, yarns or fabric bring ideas into designs.

===In film===
{{main|Collage film}}
Collage film is traditionally defined as, “A film that juxtaposes fictional scenes with footage taken from disparate sources, such as newsreels.” Combining [[Found footage (appropriation)|different types of footage]] can have various implications depending on the director’s approach.  Collage film can also refer to the physical collaging of materials onto filmstrips. Canadian Film maker, [[Arthur Lipsett]], was especially renown for his collage films, many of which were made from the cutting room floors of the National Film Board studios.

====In post-production====
The use of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], or ''computer-generated imagery'', can be considered a form of collage, especially when animated graphics are layered over traditional film footage.  At certain moments during ''[[Amélie]]'' (Jean-Pierre Juenet, 2001), the [[mise en scène]] takes on a highly fantasized style, including fictitious elements like swirling tunnels of color and light.  David O. Russel’s ''[[I Heart Huckabees]]'' (2004) incorporates CGI effects to visually demonstrate philosophical theories explained by the existential detectives (played by [[Lily Tomlin]] and [[Dustin Hoffman]]).  In this case, the effects serve to enhance clarity, while adding a surreal aspect to an otherwise realistic film.

==Legal issues==
When collage uses existing works, the result is what some [[copyright]] [[scholar]]s call a ''[[derivative work]]''. The collage thus has a copyright separate from any copyrights pertaining to the original incorporated works.

Due to redefined and reinterpreted copyright laws, and increased financial interests, some forms of collage art are significantly restricted. For example, in the area of [[sound collage]] (such as [[hip hop music]]), some court rulings effectively have eliminated the [[de minimis]] doctrine as a defense to [[copyright infringement]], thus shifting collage practice away from non-permissive uses relying on [[fair use]] or [[de minimis]] protections, and toward [[licensing]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''Bridgeport Music'', 6th Cir.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of musical collage art that have run afoul of modern copyright are ''[[The Grey Album]]'' and [[Negativland]]'s ''U2''.

The copyright status of visual works is less troubled, although still ambiguous. For instance, some visual collage artists have argued that the [[first-sale doctrine]] protects their work. The first-sale doctrine prevents copyright holders from controlling consumptive uses after the "first sale" of their work, although the [[Ninth Circuit]] has held that the first-sale doctrine does not apply to [[derivative works]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mirage Editions, Inc. v. Albuquerque A.R.T. Co.'', 856 F.2d 1341 (9th Cir. 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[de minimis]] doctrine and the [[fair use]] exception also provide important defenses against claimed copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://fairusenetwork.org/ Fair Use Network] for further explanations.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Circuit]] in October, 2006, held that artist [[Jeff Koons]] was not liable for copyright infringement because his incorporation of a photograph into a collage painting was fair use.&lt;ref&gt;''Blanch v. Koons'', -- F.3d --, 2006 WL 3040666 (2d Cir. Oct. 26, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Crash Magazine''''' is a French independent magazine published biannually that features articles on women's fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Women's Fashion/ Crash|url=http://www.speedimpex.com/store/products/459-crash.aspx|accessdate=25 February 2016|work=Speed Impex|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307081318/http://www.speedimpex.com/store/products/459-crash.aspx|archivedate=7 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
''Crash Magazine'' was founded in 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fashion Magazines|url=http://www.kismetgirls.com/Clothing/Fashion_Magazines_Clothing_Accessories.htm|work=Kismet Girls|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Frank Perrin and Armelle Leturcq; art critics before publishing ''Crash'', Perrin and Leturcq had previously published an art review known as ''Blocnotes''. They are both considered part of the new generation of French art critics that left a mark in the 1990s. The magazine is published biannually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=&gt;Home &gt;Shop &gt;FASHION &gt;Crash|url=http://www.magnation.co.nz/product/1295829|accessdate=25 February 2016|work=Mag Nation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303171549/http://www.magnation.co.nz/product/1295829|archive-date=2016-03-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francois Bizot]], the founder of ''L'Actuel'' has mentioned that the creation of this publication revolutionized the landscape of French press.

''Crash'' arrived on the French market characterized with an element of the unexpected, filled with a deliberate desire to change things: characterized by a minimalist layout and design, it is constituted by challenging avant-garde visuals seeking to emphasize the beauty of things with innovative ideas. ''Crash'' worked in close relation with artists such as [[Air (French band)|Air]], [[Daft Punk]], [[Abel Ferrara]], [[Larry Clark]], [[Jared Leto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.crash.fr/meeting-with-jared-leto-for-crash-magazine/|title=why Jared Leto is making music?|last=Céline|first=Rey|date=29 May 2013|work=CRASH Magazine|language=fr-FR|access-date=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Gondry]] during the emergence of the "[[French touch|French Touch]]". Since 2000, however, they have shifted their focus towards the "New Generation" such as [[Sofia Coppola]], [[Phoenix (band)|Phoenix]] and [[Super Discount]].

''Crash'' quickly started to gain the attention of high-end luxury brands such as [[Chanel]] and [[Christian Dior]], who looked to revamp their image and attract a younger public, something ''Crash'' was able to provide.

''Crash Magazine'' has been considered a platform for rising talent and new artists and its team is internationally recognized. This publication focuses on fashion and cinema among other things, fashion representing a cultural phenomenon of society and everything that is driven by it in our time. ''Crash'' has been recognized as the only French publication that dares to mix high-end fashion with urban culture, representing the image of a new generation of consumers that has recently emerged.

''Crash'' enjoys a circulation of 80,000, also publishing an English version sold internationally. The average reader (20–45 years old) sees ''Crash'' as a reference point that explores the fresh and upcoming trends, styles, culture and lifestyle.

After its 12 years of existence, ''Crash Magazine'' has developed its reputation and credibility without compromising its foundations, becoming in this way, a major reference in French press.

[[File:De vulgari eloquentia.tif|thumb|''De vulgari eloquentia'', 1577]]
'''''De vulgari eloquentia''''' ({{IPA-la|de vulˈɡari eloˈkwentsi.a|church}}, {{IPA-la|deː wʊɫˈɡaːriː eːɫɔˈkᶣɛnti.aː|classical}}; {{IPA-it|de vulˈɡaːri eloˈkwɛntsja|lang}}; "On eloquence in the [[vernacular]]") is the title of a [[Latin]] essay by [[Dante Alighieri]]. Although meant to consist of four books, its writing was abandoned in the middle of the second book. It was probably composed shortly after Dante went into exile; internal evidence points to a date between 1302 and 1305.

In the first book, Dante discusses the relationship between Latin and [[vernacular]], and the search for an "illustrious" vernacular in the [[Italy|Italian]] area; the second book is an analysis of the structure of the ''canto'' or song (also spelled ''[[canzone|canzuni]]'' in [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]), which is a [[literary genre]] developed in the Sicilian School of poetry.

Latin essays were very popular in the [[Middle Ages]], but Dante made some innovations in his work: firstly, the subject (writing in vernacular) was an uncommon topic in literary discussion at that time. Also significant was how Dante approached this theme; that is, he presented an argument for giving vernacular the same dignity and legitimacy Latin was typically given. Finally, Dante wrote this essay in order to analyse the origin and the [[philosophy]] of the vernacular, because, in his opinion, this language was not something static, but something that evolves and needed a historical contextualisation.

==Structure==
Dante interrupted his work at the fourteenth chapter of the second book, and though historians have tried to find a reason for this, it is still not known why Dante so abruptly aborted his essay. Indeed it is an unfinished project, and so information about its intended structure is limited. Though at some point, Dante mentions a fourth book in which he planned to deal with the [[comic genre]] and the "mediocre" style, nothing at all is known about the third book. It is thought, however, that the first book was meant to be a sort of preface to the following three books, and so shorter than the others.

==Content==
In the beginning, Dante tackles the historical evolution of [[language]], which he thinks was born unitary and, at a later stage, was separated into different idioms because of the presumptuousness demonstrated by humankind at the time of the building of the [[Tower of Babel]]. He compiles a map of the geographical position of the languages he knows, dividing the European territory into three parts: one to the east, with the [[Greek language]]s; one to the north, with the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] languages, which he believed included Magyar and Slavic languages; one to the south, separated into three Romance languages identified by their word for 'yes': [[Occitan language|oc language]], [[Langue d'oïl|oïl language]] and [[Italian language|sì language]]. He then discusses ''gramatica'', "[[grammar]]", which is a static language consisting of unchanging rules, needed to make up for the [[natural language]]s. In chapters ten to fifteen of the first book, Dante writes about his search for the [[illustrious vernacular]], among the fourteen varieties he claims to have found in the Italian region. In the second book, Dante deals with literary genres, specifying which are the ones that suit the vernacular.

==Models==
Dante takes inspiration from rhetorical essays in Latin, [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], and Italian, and from philosophical readings. The main classical rhetorical texts from which he drew information were the ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' by [[Horace]], the ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' by an anonymous author, and ''[[De Inventione]]'' by [[Cicero]]. About the philosophical works, it is important to know that Dante read not only first hand texts, but also summaries  that sometimes were not of the original work, but of an intermediary one.  The influence and importance of the contribution of the Sicilian language is emphasized by his assertion that "the first hundred and fifty years of Italian poetry was written in Sicilian". 

The major Occitan work that influenced Dante was probably ''Razos de trobar'' by the [[Catalan people|Catalan]] [[troubadour]] [[Raimon Vidal de Bezaudun]] and the ''Vers e regles de trobar'', an amplification of Vidal's manual, by [[Jofre de Foixà]].{{sfn|Ewert|1940|page=357}}{{sfn|Weiss|1942|page=160 n1}} Both of these works were Occitan manuals of grammar for troubadour poetry. They implicitly and explicitly defended Occitan as the best vernacular for song and verse, prompting Dante to come to the defence of his beloved Tuscan tongue. The popularity of both singing and composing in Occitan by Italians prompted Dante to write: {{lang|it|A perpetuale infamia e depressione delli malvagi uomini d'Italia, che commendano lo volgare altrui, e lo loro proprio dispregiano, dico...}},{{sfn|Graham-Leigh|2005|pages=32 and n130}} meaning "To the perpetual shame and lowness of the wicked men of Italy, that praise somebody else's vernacular and despise their own, I say..." (''[[Convivio]]'', treatise I, XI).

Directly or indirectly, Dante came to read [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]'s works, the ''[[Consolation of Philosophy|De Consolatione Philosophiae]]'' by [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boëthius]], [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]]'s works and some [[encyclopedic dictionary|encyclopedic dictionaries]] like the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' by [[Isidore of Seville]] and the ''[[Livre du Tresor]]'' by [[Brunetto Latini]]. He takes also inspiration from [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] philosophy, and references to texts by representatives of what is sometimes referred to as [[Radical Aristotelianism]] can be found in Dante's work.

[[File:Galileos Dialogue Title Page.png|thumb|300px|right|Frontispiece and title page of the ''Dialogue'', 1632]]
The '''''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems''''' (''Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo'') is a 1632 [[Italian-language]] book by [[Galileo Galilei]] comparing the [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] system with the traditional [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] system. It was translated into Latin as ''Systema cosmicum''&lt;ref&gt;Maurice A. Finocchiaro: [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVMy7yoGbdIC&amp;pg=PA61 ''Retrying Galileo, 1633-1992''], University of California Press, 2007 {{ISBN|0-520-25387-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-520-25387-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-en|Cosmic System}}) in 1635 by [[Matthias Bernegger]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZSe6AAAAIAAJ Journal for the history of astronomy, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The book was dedicated to Galileo's patron, [[Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]], who received the first printed copy on February 22, 1632.&lt;ref name="Gindikin1988"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gindikin|first=Semen Grigorʹevich|title=Tales of physicists and mathematicians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vhx--jfFN8IC&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=22 February 2011|year=1988|publisher=[[Birkhäuser]]|isbn=978-0-8176-3317-2|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]], the Earth and other planets orbit the Sun, while in the [[Ptolemaic system]], everything in the Universe circles around the Earth. The ''Dialogue'' was published in [[Florence]] under a formal license from the [[Inquisition]]. In 1633, Galileo was found to be "vehemently suspect of [[heresy]]" based on the book, which was then placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index of Forbidden Books]]'', from which it was not removed until 1835 (after the theories it discussed had been permitted in print in 1822).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/galileo/galileochronology.html The Trial of Galileo: A Chronology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205213233/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/galileo/galileochronology.html |date=2007-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an action that was not announced at the time, the publication of anything else he had written or ever might write was also banned in Catholic countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|_note-publication-ban}}See [[Galileo affair#note-publication-ban|Galileo affair]] for more details, including sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
While writing the book, Galileo referred to it as his ''Dialogue on the Tides'', and  when the manuscript went to the Inquisition for approval, the title was ''Dialogue on the Ebb and Flow of the Sea''. He was ordered to remove all mention of tides from the title and to change the preface because granting approval to such a title would look like approval of his theory of the [[tide]]s using the motion of the Earth as proof. As a result, the formal title on the title page is ''Dialogue'', which is followed by Galileo's name, academic posts, and followed by a long subtitle. The name by which the work is now known was extracted by the printer from the description on the title page when permission was given to reprint it with an approved preface by a Catholic theologian in 1744.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Galileo: Pioneer Scientist|first=Stillman|last=Drake|year=1990|page=187|publisher=U of Toronto Press |isbn=0-8020-2725-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This must be kept in mind when discussing Galileo's motives for writing the book. Although the book is presented formally as a consideration of both systems (as it needed to be in order to be published at all), there is no question that the Copernican side gets the better of the argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sleepwalkers|first=Arthur|last=Koestler|page=480|publisher=Penguin Arkana|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure===
The book is presented as a series of discussions, over a span of four days, among two philosophers and a layman:

* Salviati argues for the Copernican position and presents some of Galileo's views directly, calling him the "Academician" in honor of Galileo's membership in the [[Accademia dei Lincei]]. He is named after Galileo's friend [[Filippo Salviati]] (1582–1614).
* Sagredo is an intelligent layman who is initially neutral. He is named after Galileo's friend [[Giovanni Francesco Sagredo]] (1571–1620).
* Simplicio, a dedicated follower of [[Ptolemy]] and [[Aristotle]], presents the traditional views and the arguments against the Copernican position.  He is supposedly named after [[Simplicius of Cilicia]], a sixth-century commentator on Aristotle, but it was suspected the name was a double entendre, as the Italian for "simple" (as in "simple minded") is "semplice".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Koestler, ''The Sleepwalkers: A History of Man's Changing Vision of the Universe'' (1959), Penguin Books, 1986 edition: {{ISBN|0-14-055212-X}}, 978014055212X 1990 reprint: {{ISBN|0-14-019246-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-14-019246-9}} [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0140192468]&lt;/ref&gt;  Simplicio is modeled on two contemporary conservative philosophers, [[Lodovico delle Colombe]] (1565–1616?), Galileo's opponent, and [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]] (1550–1631), a Paduan colleague who had refused to look through the telescope.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman Drake: ''Galileo at Work: His Scientific Biography'', Courier Dover Publications, 2003, {{ISBN|0-486-49542-6}}, page 355 : Cremonini and delle Colombe&lt;/ref&gt; Colombe was the leader of a group of Florentine opponents of Galileo's, which some of the latter's friends referred to as "the pigeon league".&lt;ref&gt;"La legha del pippione". "Pippione" is a pun on Colombe's surname—which is the plural of the Italian word for dove. Galileo's friends, the painter, [[:it:Cigoli|Lodovico Cardi da Cigoli]] {{it icon}}, his former student, [[Benedetto Castelli]], and a couple of his other correspondents often referred to Colombe as "il Colombo", which means "the Pigeon".  Galileo himself used this term a couple of times in a letter to Cigoli of October, 1611 [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=11-214 (Edizione Nazionale 11:214)]. The more derisive nickname, "il Pippione", sometimes used by Cigoli [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=11-176 (Edizione Nazionale 11:176,] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=11-229 11:229,] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=11-476 11:476,][http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=11-502 11:502)], is a now archaic Italian word with a triple entendre.   Besides meaning "young pigeon", it is also a jocular term for a testicle, and a Tuscan dialect word for a fool.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content===
The discussion is not narrowly limited to astronomical topics, but ranges over much of contemporary science. Some of this is to show what Galileo considered good science, such as the discussion of [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]]'s work on magnetism.  Other parts are important to the debate, answering erroneous arguments against the Earth's motion.

A classic argument against earth motion is the lack of speed sensations of the earth surface, though it moves, by the earth's rotation, at about 1700&amp;nbsp;km/h at the equator. In this category there is a [[thought experiment]] in which a man is below decks on a [[Galileo's ship|ship]] and cannot tell whether the ship is docked or is moving smoothly through the water: he observes water dripping from a bottle, fish swimming in a tank, butterflies flying, and so on; and their behavior is just the same whether the ship is moving or not.   This is a classic exposition of the [[Inertial frame of reference]] and refutes the objection that if we were moving hundreds of kilometres an hour as the Earth rotated, anything that one dropped would rapidly fall behind and drift to the west.

The bulk of Galileo's arguments may be divided into three classes:

* Rebuttals to the objections raised by traditional philosophers; for example, the thought experiment on the ship.
* Observations that are incompatible with the Ptolemaic model: the [[phases of Venus]], for instance, which simply couldn't happen, or the apparent motions of [[sunspot]]s, which could only be explained in the Ptolemaic or Tychonic systems as resulting from an implausibly complicated precession of the Sun's axis of rotation.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, [[#Reference-Drake-1970|(1970]], pp.191–196), Linton [[#Reference-Linton-2004|(2004]], pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=B4br4XJFj0MC&amp;pg=PA211 211–12)], Sharratt [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|(1994]], p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-TgYAq3P0P8C&amp;pg=PA166 166)].  This is not true, however, for geocentric systems—such as that proposed by [[Longomontanus]]—in which the Earth rotated.  In such systems the apparent motion of sunspots could be accounted for just as easily as in Copernicus's.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Arguments showing that the elegant unified theory of the Heavens that the philosophers held, which was believed to prove that the Earth was stationary, was incorrect; for instance, the mountains of the [[Moon]], the moons of [[Jupiter]], and the very existence of sunspots, none of which was part of the old astronomy.

Generally, these arguments have held up well in terms of the knowledge of the next four centuries.  Just how convincing they ought to have been to an impartial reader in 1632 remains a contentious issue.

Galileo attempted a fourth class of argument:

* Direct physical argument for the Earth's motion, by means of an explanation of tides.

As an account of the causation of tides or a proof of the Earth's motion, it is a failure. The fundamental argument is internally inconsistent and actually leads to the conclusion that tides do not exist. But, Galileo was fond of the argument and devoted the "Fourth Day" of the discussion to it. The degree of its failure is—like nearly anything having to do with Galileo—a matter of controversy.  On the one hand, the whole thing has recently been described in print as "cockamamie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Science, Religion, and the Galileo Affair |author=Timothy Moy |date=September 2001 |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |url=http://csicop.org/si/2001-09// |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=43–49 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129142753/http://csicop.org/si/2001-09// |archivedate=January 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] used a rather different description:

[[File:Dialogo Galileo SWRI.jpg|thumb|250px|A copy of the ''Dialogo'', Florence edition, located at the [[Tom Slick]] rare book collection at [[Southwest Research Institute]], in [[Texas]].]]
The ''Dialogue'' does not treat the [[Tychonic system]], which was becoming the preferred system of many astronomers at the time of publication and which was ultimately proven incorrect.  The Tychonic system is a motionless Earth system but not a Ptolemaic system;  it is a hybrid system of the Copernican and Ptolemaic models.  Mercury and Venus orbit the Sun (as in the Copernican system) in small circles, while the sun in turn orbits a stationary Earth;  Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn orbit the Sun in much larger circles, which means they also orbit the earth.  The Tychonian system is mathematically equivalent to the Copernican system, except that the Copernican system predicts a [[Stelaar parralax|stellar parallax]], while the Tychonian system predicts no stellar parallax.  Stellar parallax was not measurable until the 19th century, and therefore there was at the time no valid disproof of the Tychonic system on empirical grounds, nor any decisive observational evidence for the Copernican system.

Galileo never took Tycho's system seriously, as can be seen in his correspondence, regarding it as an inadequate and physically unsatisfactory compromise.  A reason for the absence of Tycho's system (in spite of many references to Tycho and his work in the book) may be sought in Galileo's theory of the tides, which provided the original title and organizing principle of the ''Dialogue''.  For, while the Copernican and Tychonic systems are equivalent geometrically, they are quite different dynamically. Galileo's tidal theory entailed the actual, physical movement of the Earth; that is, if true, it would have provided the kind of proof that [[Foucault pendulum|Foucault's pendulum]] apparently provided two centuries later.  With reference to Galileo's tidal theory, there would be no difference between the Ptolemaic and Tychonic systems.

Galileo also fails to discuss the possibility of non-circular orbits, although [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler's]] proposal of an elliptical orbit for Mars had been published in 1609. Prince Cesi's letter to Galileo of 1612 treated the two laws of 1609 as common knowledge. Kepler's third law was published in 1619. A heliocentric system with planets in approximately elliptical orbits is deducible from [[Isaac Newton#Mechanics and gravitation|Newton's laws of motion and gravity]], but these were not published until 1687.

==Summary==
'''Preface: To the Discerning Reader'''
refers to the ban on the "Pythagorean opinion that the earth moves" and says that the author "takes the Copernican side with a pure mathematical hypothesis". He introduces the friends [[Giovanni Francesco Sagredo|Sagredo]] and [[Filippo Salviati|Salviati]] with whom he had had discussions as well as the [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] philosopher [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicio]].

===Day one===

He starts with Aristotle's proof of the completeness and perfection of the world (i.e. the universe) because of its three dimensions. Simplicio points out that three was favoured by the Pythagoreans whereas Salviati can't understand why three legs are better than two or four. He suggests that the numbers were "trifles which later spread among the vulgar" and that their definitions, such as those of straight lines and right angles, were more useful in establishing the dimensions. Simplicio's response was that Aristotle thought that in physical matters mathematical demonstration wasn't always needed. 

Salviati attacks Aristotle's definition of the heavens as incorruptible and unchanging whilst only the lunar-bound zone shows change. He points to the changes seen in the skies: the new stars of [[SN 1572|1572]] and [[Kepler's Supernova|1604]] and [[Sunspot#17th and 18th centuries|sunspots]], seen through the new [[telescope]]. There is a discussion about Aristotle's use of ''a priori'' arguments. Salviati suggests that he uses his experience to choose an appropriate argument to prove just as others do and that he would change his mind in the present circumstances.

Simplicio argues that sunspots could simply be small opaque objects passing in front of the sun, but Salviati points out that some appear or disappear randomly and those at the edge are flattened, unlike separate bodies. Therefore, "it is better Aristotelian philosophy to say 'Heaven is alterable because my senses tell me' than 'Heaven is unalterable because Aristotle was so persuaded by reasoning'".

Experiments with a mirror are used to show that the moon's surface must be opaque and not a perfect crystal sphere as Simplicio believes. He  refuses to accept that mountains on the moon cause shadows, or that reflected light from the earth is responsible for the faint outline in a crescent moon.

Sagredo holds that he considers the earth noble because of the changes in it whereas Simplicio says that change in the moon or stars would be useless because they do not benefit man. Salviati points out that days on the moon are a month long and despite the varied terrain that the telescope has disclosed, it wouldn't sustain life. Humans acquire mathematical truths slowly and hesitantly, whereas God knows the full infinity of them intuitively. And when one looks into the marvellous things men have understood and contrived, then clearly the human mind is one of the most excellent of God's works.

===Day two===

Salviati starts by repeating that Aristotle would be changing his opinions if he saw what they were seeing. "It is the followers of Aristotle who have crowned him with authority, not he who has usurped or appropriated it to himself."

There is one supreme motion—that by which the sun, moon, planets and fixed stars appear to be moved from east to west in the space of 24 hours. This may as logically belong to the earth alone as to the rest of the universe. Aristotle and Ptolemy, who understood this, do not argue against any other motion than this diurnal one.

Motion is relative: the position of the sacks of grain on a ship can be identical at the end of the voyage despite the movement of the ship. Why should we believe that nature moves all these extremely large bodies with inconceivable velocities rather than simply moving the moderately sized earth? If the earth is removed from the picture, what happens to all the movement?

The movement of the skies from east to west is the opposite of all the other motions of the heavenly bodies which are from west to east; making the earth rotate brings it into line with all the others. Although Aristotle argues that circular motions are not contraries, they could still lead to collisions.

The great orbits of the planets take longer than the shorter: Saturn and Jupiter take many years, Mars two, whereas the moon takes only a month. Jupiter's moons take even less. This is not changed if the earth rotates every day, but if the earth is stationary then we suddenly find that the sphere of the fixed stars rotates in 24 hours. Given the distances, that would more reasonably be thousands of years.

In addition some of these stars have to travel faster than others: if the Pole Star was precisely at the axis, then it would be entirely stationary whereas those of the equator have unimaginable speed. The solidity of this supposed sphere is incomprehensible. Make the earth the [[primum mobile]] and the need for this extra sphere disappears.

[[File:Dialogue-day2-9.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Actual path of cannonball B is from C to D]]
They consider three main objections to the motion of the earth: that a falling body would be left behind by the earth and thus fall far to the west of its point of release; that a cannonball fired to the west would similarly fly much further than one fired to the east; and that a cannonball fired vertically would also land far to the west. Salviati shows that these do not take account of the [[Theory of impetus|impetus]] of the cannon.

He also points out that attempting to prove that the earth doesn't move by using vertical fall commits the logical fault of [[paralogism]] (assuming what is to be proved), because if the earth is moving then it is only in appearance that it is falling vertically; in fact it is falling at a slant, as happens with a cannonball rising through the cannon (illustrated).

In rebutting a work which claims that a ball falling from the moon would take six days to arrive, the odd-number rule is introduced: a body falling 1 unit in an interval would fall 3 units in the next interval, 5 units in the subsequent one, etc. This gives rise to the rule by which the distance fallen is according to the square of the time. Using this he calculates the time is really little more than 3 hours. He also points out that density of the material doesn't make much difference: a lead ball might only accelerate twice as fast as one of cork.

In fact, a ball falling from such a height wouldn't fall behind but ahead of the vertical because the rotational motion would be in ever-decreasing circles. What makes the earth move is similar to whatever moves Mars or Jupiter and is the same as that which pulls the stone to earth. Calling it [[gravity]] doesn't explain what it is.

===Day three===

Salviati starts by dismissing the arguments of a book against the [[nova]]s he has been reading overnight.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|first=Scipio|last=Chiaramonti|title=De tribus novis stellis|year=1628}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike comets, these were stationary and their lack of parallax easily checked and thus could not have been in the sublunary sphere.

Simplicio now gives the greatest argument against the annual motion of the earth that if it moves then it can no longer be the center of the zodiac, the world. Aristotle gives proofs that the universe is finite bounded and spherical. Salvatius points out that these disappear if he denies him the assumption that it is movable, but allows the assumption initially in order not to multiply disputes.

[[File:Dialogue-day3-1.png|thumb|right|The solar system]]
He points out that if anything is the centre, it must be the sun not the earth, because all the planets are closer or further away from the earth at different times, Venus and Mars up to eight times. He encourages Simplicio to make a plan of the planets, starting with Venus and Mercury which are easily seen to rotate about the sun. Mars must also go about the sun (as well as the earth) since it is never seen [[Crescent|horned]], unlike Venus now seen through the telescope; similarly with Jupiter and Saturn. Earth, which is between Mars with a period of two years and Venus with nine months, has a period of a year which may more elegantly be attributed to motion than a state of rest.

Sagredo brings up two other common objections. If the earth rotated, the mountains would soon be in a position that one would have to descend them rather than ascend.  Secondly, the motion would be so rapid that someone at the bottom of a well would have only a brief instance to glimpse a star as it traversed. Simplicio can see that the first is no different from travelling over the globe, as any who have circumnavigated but though he realises the second is the same as if the heavens were rotating, he still doesn't understand it. Salviati says the first is no different from those who deny the antipodes. For the second, he encourages Simplicio to decide what fraction of the sky can be seen from down the well.

Salviati brings up another problem, which is that Mars and Venus are not as variable as the theory would suggest. He explains that the size of a star to the human eye is affected by the brightness and the sizes are not real. This is resolved by use of the telescope which also shows the crescent shape of Venus. A further objection to the movement of the earth, the unique existence of the moon, has been resolved by the discovery of the [[moons of Jupiter]], which would appear like our moon to any Jovian.

[[File:Dialogue-day3-2.png|thumb|right|How retrogression is explained by Copernicus]]
Copernicus has succeeded in reducing some of the uneven motions of Ptolemy who had to deal with motions that sometimes go fast, sometimes slow, and sometimes backwards, by means of vast [[epicycle]]s. Mars, above the sun's sphere, often falls far below it, then soars above it. These anomalies are cured by the annual movement of the earth. This is explained by a diagram in which the varying motion of Jupiter is shown using the earth's orbit.

Simplicio produces another booklet in which theological arguments are mixed with astronomic, but Salviati refuses to address the issues from Scripture. So he produces the argument that the fixed stars must be at an inconceivable distance with the smallest larger than the whole orbit of the earth. Salviati explains that this all comes from a misrepresentation of what Copernicus said, resulting in a huge over-calculation of the size of a sixth magnitude star. But many other famous astronomers over-estimated the size of stars by ignoring the brightness factor. Not even Tycho, with his accurate instruments, set himself to measure the size of any star except the sun and moon. But Salviati (Galileo) was able to make a reasonable estimate simply by hanging a cord to obscure the star and measuring the distance from eye to cord.

But still many cannot believe that the fixed stars can individually be as big or bigger than the sun. To what end are these? Salviati maintains that "it is brash for our feebleness to attempt to judge the reasons for God's actions, and to call everything in the universe vain and superfluous which does not serve us".

Has Tycho or any of his disciples tried to investigate in any way phenomena that might affirm or deny the movement of the earth? Do any of them know how much [[Variation (astronomy)|variation]] is needed in the fixed stars? Simplicio objects to conceding that the distance of the fixed stars is too great for it to be detectable. Salviati points out how difficult it is even to detect the varying distances of Saturn. Many of the positions of the fixed stars are not known accurately and far better instruments than Tycho's are needed: say using a sight with a fixed position 60 miles away.

Sagredo then asks Salviati to explain how the Copernican system explains the seasons and inequalities of night and day. This he does with the aid of a diagram showing the position of the earth in the four seasons. He points out how much simpler it is than the Ptolemaic system. But Simplicio thinks Aristotle was wise to avoid too much geometry. He prefers Aristotle's axiom to avoid more than one simple motion at a time.

===Day four===

They are in Sagredo's house in [[Venice]], where tides are an important issue, and Salviati wants to show the effect of the earth's movement on the tides. He first points out the three periods of the tides: ''daily (diurnal)'', generally with intervals of 6 hours of rising and six more of falling; ''monthly'', seemingly from the moon, which increases or decreases these tides; and ''annual'', leading to different sizes at the equinoxes.

He considers first the daily motion. Three varieties are observed: in some places the waters rise and fall without any forward motion; in others they move towards the east and back to the west without rising or falling; in still others there is a combination of both—this happens in Venice where the waters rise on entering and fall on leaving. In the [[Straits of Messina]] there are very swift currents between [[Scylla and Charybdis]]. In the open [[Mediterranean]] the alteration of height is small but the currents are noticeable.

Simplicio counters with the [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] explanations, which are based on the depths of the sea, and the dominion of the moon over the water, though this doesn't explain the risings when the moon is below the horizon. But he admits it could be a miracle.

When the water in Venice rises, where does it come from? There is little rise in Corfu or Dubrovnik. From the ocean through the [[Straits of Gibraltar]]? It's much too far away and the currents are too slow.

So could the movement of the container cause the disturbance? Consider the  barges that bring water into Venice. When they hit an obstacle, the water rushes forward; when they speed up it will go to the back. For all this disturbance there is no need for new water and the level in the middle stays largely constant though the water there rushes backwards and forwards.

Consider a point on the earth under the joint action of the annual and diurnal movements. At one time these are added together and 12 hours later they act against each other, so there is an alternate speeding up and slowing down. So the ocean basins are affected in the same way as the barge particularly in an east-west direction. Note also that the length of the barge makes a difference to the speed of oscillations, just as the length of a plumb bob changes its speed. The depth of water also makes a difference to the size of vibrations.

The primary effect only explains tides once a day; one must look elsewhere for the six-hour change, to the oscillation periods of the water. In some places, such as the [[Hellespont]] and the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] the periods are briefer and variable. But a north-south sea like the [[Red Sea]] has very little tide whereas the Messina Strait carries the pent up effect of two basins.

Simplicio objects that if this accounts for the water, should it not even more be seen in the winds? Salviati suggests that the containing basins are not so effective and the air does not sustain its motion. Nevertheless, these forces are seen by the [[Trade wind|steady winds]] from east to west in the oceans in the [[torrid zone]].

It seems that the moon also is taking part in the production of the daily effects, but that is repugnant to his mind. The motions of the moon have caused great difficulty to astronomers. It's impossible to make a full account of these things given the irregular nature of the sea basins.

'''''Fantasy Bedtime Hour''''' &lt;!--do NOT change it to "was" --&gt;is&lt;!--per [[MOS:TV]]--&gt; [[public-access television]] [[cable TV]] program on [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] channel 29.  It can be described by its tagline, "Two girls in bed ill equipped to handle fantasy novel concepts discuss [[Lord Foul's Bane]]" (the novel by [[Stephen R. Donaldson]]).

Each of the forty episodes in the series consists of Heatherly Stankey and Julie Breithaupt in bed together, reading and discussing the text.  According to a [[San Francisco Chronicle]] reviewer, the women are supposedly, but not actually, nude beneath the covers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/06/23/DDGETDCGPN1.DTL&amp;hw=fantasy+bedtime+hour&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000 What's on TV? Oh, the usual sci-fi fantasy, read by women in bed.(Neva Chonin, Chronicle Critic at Large)Thursday, June 23, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a reading with paraphrase, a quick analysis, a reenactment or "fantasy action sequence", and then a discussion with an 'expert' - the experts being individuals who have actually finished and understood the book.  Toward the end of the series, Stephen R. Donaldson himself appeared in some episodes as the "expert". A highlight of the show are the "charts" drawn during the program to illustrate some concept from the reading.

'''Ivan Konstantinovich Aivazovsky''' ({{lang-ru|Ива́н Константи́нович Айвазо́вский}}; 29 July 1817{{spaced ndash}}2 May 1900) was a Russian [[Romanticism|Romantic]] [[painting|painter]] who is considered one of the greatest masters of [[marine art]]. Baptized as '''Hovhannes Aivazian''', he was born into an [[Armenians|Armenian]] family in the [[Black Sea]] port of [[Feodosia]] in [[Crimea]] and was mostly based there.

Following his education at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], Aivazovsky traveled to Europe and lived briefly in [[Italy]] in the early 1840s. He then returned to Russia and was appointed the main painter of the [[Russian Navy]]. Aivazovsky had close ties with the military and political elite of the Russian Empire and often attended military maneuvers. He was sponsored by the state and was well-regarded during his lifetime. The saying "worthy of Aivazovsky's brush", popularized by [[Anton Chekhov]], was used in Russia for describing something lovely. He remains highly popular in Russia.&lt;ref name="2017poll"/&gt;

One of the most prominent [[List of Russian artists|Russian artists]] of his time, Aivazovsky was also popular outside Russia. He held numerous [[solo exhibition]]s in Europe and the United States. During his almost 60-year career, he created around 6,000 paintings, making him one of the most prolific artists of his time.{{sfn|Leek|2012|p=178}}&lt;ref name="Lang"/&gt; The vast majority of his works are [[seascape]]s, but he often depicted battle scenes, Armenian themes, and portraiture. Most of Aivazovsky's works are kept in Russian, [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] and [[Armenia]]n museums as well as private collections.

==Life==

===Background===
Ivan Aivazovsky was born on 17 July (29 in [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|New Style]]) 1817 in the city of [[Feodosia]] (Theodosia), [[Crimea]], Russian Empire.&lt;ref name="Ghazarian"/&gt; In the baptismal records of the local St. Sargis [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] Church, Aivazovsky was listed as ''Hovhannes, son of Gevorg Aivazian'' ({{lang-hy|Գէորգ Այվազեանի որդի Յօհաննեսն}}).{{sfn|Harutiunian|1965|p=89}} During his study at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]], he was known in Russian as Ivan Gaivazovsky (Иванъ Гайвазовскій in the pre-1918 spelling).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Petrov|first=Pyotr|title=Указатель к Сборнику матеріалов для исторіи Императорской С.-Петербургской Академіи художеств за сто лѣт ея существованія [Index to the collection of materials for the history of the Imperial St. Petersburg Academy of Arts for 100 years of its existence]|year=1887|publisher=[[:ru:Стасюлевич, Михаил Матвеевич|M.

Stasulevich]]|location=St. Petersburg|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gQQoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA51 51]|authorlink=:ru:Петров, Пётр Николаевич|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became known as Aivazovsky since {{circa|1840}}, while in Italy.{{sfn|Harutiunian|1965|p=93}} He signed an 1844 letter with an [[Italianization|Italianized]] rendition of his name: "Giovani Aivazovsky".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AIVAZOVKSY, Ivan (1817–1900).

His father, Konstantin, ({{circa|1765}}–1840),{{sfn|Mikaelian|1991|p=69}} was an Armenian merchant from the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish]] region of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. His family had migrated to Europe from [[Western Armenia]] in the 18th century. After numerous familial conflicts, Konstantin left Galicia for [[Moldavia]], later moving to [[Bukovina]], before settling in Feodosia in the early 1800s.{{sfn|Sarkssian|1963|p=25}} He was initially known as Gevorg Aivazian (Haivazian or Haivazi), but he changed his last name to Gaivazovsky by adding the Polish "[[Polish name#Suffix -ski.2F-ska|-sky]]". Aivazovsky's mother, Ripsime, was a Feodosia Armenian. The couple had five children—three daughters and two sons.{{sfn|Sarkssian|1963|p=25}} Aivazovsky's elder brother, [[Gabriel Aivazovsky|Gabriel]], was a prominent historian and an Armenian Apostolic archbishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Donenko|first1=Nikolay|title=Православные монастыри: Симферопольская и Крымская епархия Украинской православной церкви Московского патриархата|date=2007|publisher=Sonat|page=82|language=ru|quote=О нем писал армянский епископ Гавриил (Айвазовский), брат выдающегося художника- мариниста...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Armenia’s in Venice to Highlight Save Venice 2004|url=http://asbarez.com/49660/armenias-in-venice-to-highlight-save-venice-2004/|work=[[Asbarez]]|date=23 March 2004|quote=The great seascape painter Ivan Aivazovsky (Hovhannes Aivazian)–while visiting his brother Archbishop Gabriel Aivazovsky–immortalized the Island and the Venetian lagoon in numerous magnificent paintings.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
The young Aivazovsky received parochial education at Feodosia's St. Sargis Armenian Church.{{sfn|Mikaelian|1991|p=59}} He was taught drawing by Jacob Koch, a local architect. Aivazovsky moved to [[Simferopol]] with [[Taurida Governorate|Taurida Governor]] Alexander Kaznacheyev's family in 1830 and attended the city's [[Simferopol gymnasium №1|Russian gymnasium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bobkov|first=V.

Vernadsky University]]|location=Simferopol|language=ru|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1833, Aivazovsky arrived in the Russian capital, [[Saint Petersburg]], to study at the Imperial Academy of Arts in [[Maxim Vorobiev]]'s landscape class. In 1835, he was awarded with a silver medal and appointed assistant to the French painter Philippe Tanneur ([[:fr:Philippe Tanneur|fr]]).&lt;ref name="tretyakovgallery"/&gt; In September 1836, Aivazovsky met Russia's national poet [[Alexander Pushkin]] during the latter's visit to the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alexander Pushkin: a celebration of Russia's best-loved writer|year=1999|publisher=Hazar Publishing|location=London|isbn=1-874371-14-8|page=219|editor=Briggs, A.D.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sotheby's Russian Art Evening sale|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/lot.pdf.L08112.html/f/6/L08112-6.pdf|publisher=[[Sotheby's]]|accessdate=2 February 2014|date=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1837, Aivazovsky joined the [[Military art|battle-painting]] class of [[Alexander Sauerweid]] and participated in [[Baltic Fleet]] exercises in the [[Gulf of Finland]].&lt;ref name="RusArtNet"/&gt; In October 1837, he graduated from the Imperial Academy of Arts with a gold medal, two years earlier than intended.{{sfn|Bolton|2010|p=140}}{{sfn|Mikaelian|1991|p=59}}{{sfn|Leek|2012|p=178}} Aivazovsky returned to Feodosia in 1838 and spent two years in his native Crimea.{{sfn|Sarkssian|1963|p=25}}&lt;ref name="RusArtNet"/&gt; In 1839, he took part in military exercises in the shores of Crimea, where he met Russian admirals [[Mikhail Lazarev]], [[Pavel Nakhimov]] and [[Vladimir Alexeyevich Kornilov|Vladimir Kornilov]].&lt;ref name="Ghazarian"/&gt;{{sfn|Bolton|2010|p=141}}

===First visit to Europe===

In 1840, Aivazovsky was sent by the Imperial Academy of Arts to study in Europe.{{sfn|Bolton|2010|p=140}}&lt;ref name="RusArtNet"/&gt; He first traveled to [[Venice]] via [[Berlin]] and [[Vienna]] and visited [[San Lazzaro degli Armeni]], where an important [[Armenian Catholic]] congregation was located and his brother Gabriel lived at the time. Aivazovsky studied Armenian manuscripts and became familiar with Armenian art.&lt;ref name="Khachatrian"/&gt; He met Russian novelist [[Nikolai Gogol]] in Venice. He then headed to [[Florence]], [[Amalfi]] and [[Sorrento]]. In Florence, he met painter [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov|Alexander Ivanov]].&lt;ref name="RusArtNet"/&gt; He remained in [[Naples]] and [[Rome]] between 1840 and 1842. Aivazovsky was heavily influenced by Italian art and their museums became the "second academy" for him.&lt;ref name="Khachatrian"/&gt; According to Rogachevsky the news of successful exhibitions in Italy reached Russia.{{sfn|Leek|2012|p=178}} [[Pope Gregory XVI]] awarded him with a golden medal.&lt;ref name="Rogachevsky"/&gt; He then visited Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands and Britain, where he met English painter [[J. M. W. Turner]] who, "was so struck by Aivazovsky's picture ''The Bay of Naples on a Moonlit Night'' that he dedicated a rhymed eulogy in Italian to Aivazovsky."{{sfn|Bolton|2010|p=141}}&lt;ref name="RusArtNet"/&gt; In an international exhibition at [[the Louvre]], he was the only representative from Russia.&lt;ref name="Khachatrian"/&gt; In France, he received a gold medal from the [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]]. He then returned to Naples via Marseille and again visited Britain, Portugal, Spain, and Malta in 1843. Aivazovsky was admired throughout Europe.{{sfn|Bolton|2010|p=141}} He returned to Russia via Paris and Amsterdam in 1844.{{sfn|Bolton|2010|p=141}}

===Return to Russia and first marriage===
[[File:Aivazovsky wife and daughters.png|thumb|upright=0.9|alt=photograph of Aivazovsky with his first wife, Julia, and their four daughters|Aivazovsky with his first wife, Julia, and their four daughters]]

Upon his return to Russia, Aivazovsky was made an academician of the Imperial Academy of Arts and was appointed the "official artist of the Russian Navy to paint seascapes, coastal scenes and naval battles."&lt;ref name="tretyakovgallery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RusArtNet"/&gt; In 1845, Aivazovsky traveled to the [[Aegean Sea]] with [[Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia|Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich]] and visited the Ottoman capital, [[Constantinople]], and the Greek islands of [[Patmos]] and [[Rhodes]].&lt;ref name="RusArtNet"/&gt;

In 1845, Aivazovsky settled in his hometown of Feodosia, where he built a house and studio.&lt;ref name="Ghazarian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RusArtNet"/&gt; He isolated himself from the outside world, keeping a small circle of friends and relatives.&lt;ref name="Khachatrian"/&gt; Yet the solitude played a negative role in his art career. By the mid-nineteenth century, Russian art was moving from [[Romanticism]] towards a distinct Russian style of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], while Aivazovsky continued to paint Romantic seascapes and attracted heavy criticism.&lt;ref name="Khachatrian"/&gt;

In 1845 and 1846, Aivazovsky attended the maneuvers of the [[Black Sea Fleet]] and the Baltic Fleet at [[Petergof]], near the [[Peterhof Palace|imperial palace]]. In 1847, he was given the title of professor of seascape painting by the Imperial Academy of Arts and elevated to the rank of nobility. In the same year, he was elected to the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name="RusArtNet"/&gt;

In 1848, Aivazovsky married Julia Graves, an English governess. They had four daughters: Elena (1849), Maria (1851), Alexandra (1852) and Joanne (1858). They separated in 1860 and divorced in 1877 with permission from the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Church]], since Graves was a [[Lutheran]].&lt;ref name="RusArtNet"/&gt;{{sfn|Mikaelian|1991|p=63}}

===Rise to prominence===
[[File:Ayvaz sredy voln.jpg|thumb|left|alt=painting of whitecaps on the sea|The vast majority of his works depict the sea. Pictured is an 1898 painting titled ''Among the Waves'', Aivazovsky National Art Gallery, Feodosia]] 
In 1851, traveling with the Russian emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]], Aivazovsky sailed to [[Sevastopol]] to participate in military maneuvers. His archaeological excavations near Feodosia lead to his election as a full member of the [[Russian Geographical Society]] in 1853. In that year, the [[Crimean War]] erupted between Russia and the Ottoman Empire, and he was evacuated to [[Kharkiv]]. While safe, he returned to the besieged fortress of Sevastopol to paint battle scenes.&lt;ref name="Rogachevsky"/&gt; His work was exhibited in Sevastopol while it was under Ottoman siege.&lt;ref name="Rogachevsky"/&gt;

Between 1856 and 1857, Aivazovsky worked in Paris and became the first Russian&lt;ref name="Gomtsyan"/&gt; (and the first non-French) artist to receive the [[Legion of Honour]]. In 1857, Aivazovsky visited Constantinople and was awarded the [[Order of the Medjidie]]. In the same year, he was elected an honorary member of the Moscow Art Society. He was awarded the Greek [[Order of the Redeemer]] in 1859 and the Russian [[Order of St. Vladimir]] in 1865.&lt;ref name="Rogachevsky"/&gt;

Aivazovsky opened an art studio in Feodosia in 1865 and was awarded a salary by the Imperial Academy of Arts the same year.&lt;ref name="RusArtNet"/&gt;

===Travels and accolades: 1860s–1880s===
In the 1860s, the artist produced several paintings inspired by Greek nationalism and the [[Italian unification]].&lt;ref name="Ghazarian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogachevsky"/&gt; In 1868, he once again visited Constantinople and produced a series of works about the Greek resistance to the Turks, during the [[Cretan Revolt (1866–69)|Great Cretan Revolution]].&lt;ref name="RusArtNet"/&gt; In 1868, Aivazovsky traveled in the [[Caucasus]] and visited the [[Russian Armenia|Russian part of Armenia]] for the first time. He painted several mountainous landscapes and in 1869 held an exhibition in [[Tiflis]].&lt;ref name="Ghazarian"/&gt; Later in the year, he made a trip to Egypt and took part in the opening ceremony of the [[Suez Canal]]. He became the "first artist to paint the Suez Canal, thus marking an epoch-making event in the history of Europe, Africa and Asia."&lt;ref name="Rogachevsky"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shaljyan|first=Emma|title=Walter and Laurel Karabian Speak on Artist Aivazian (Aivazovsky)|url=http://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/hye_sharzhoom/vol33/march12/1_karabians.html|publisher=''Hye Sahrzoom'', Armenian Studies Program [[California State University, Fresno]]|accessdate=10 January 2014|date=March 2012|quote=Aivazovsky, in fact, was the first painter to paint the Suez Canal.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203153459/http://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/hye_sharzhoom/vol33/march12/1_karabians.html|archivedate=3 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, Aivazovsky was made an [[Table of Ranks|Actual Civil Councilor]], the fourth highest civil rank in Russia.&lt;ref name="RusArtNet"/&gt; In 1871, he initiated the construction of the archaeological museum in Feodosia.&lt;ref name="Rogachevsky"/&gt; In 1872, he traveled to Nice and Florence to exhibit his paintings.&lt;ref name="Rogachevsky"/&gt; In 1874, the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze]] (Florence Academy of Fine Art) asked him for a self-portrait to be hung in the [[Uffizi Gallery]].&lt;ref name="rutgers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bird|first=Alan|title=A history of Russian painting|year=1987|publisher=G.K.

Aivazovsky was elected an honorary member of [[Stuttgart]]'s Royal Academy of Fine Arts ([[:de:Staatliche Akademie der Bildenden Künste Stuttgart|de]]) in 1878. He made a trip to the Netherlands and France, staying briefly in [[Frankfurt]] until 1879. He then visited [[Munich]] and traveled to [[Genoa]] and Venice "to collect material on the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus."&lt;ref name="Rogachevsky"/&gt;

In 1880, Aivazovsky opened an art gallery in his Feodosia house; it became the third museum in the Russian Empire, after the [[Hermitage Museum]] and the [[Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name="Khachatrian"/&gt;&lt;!-- "Тогда же (1880) Айвазовский построил при своем доме картинную галерею - третий по счету музей в Российской империи"--&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogachevsky"/&gt; Aivazovsky held an 1881 exhibition at London's [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], attended by English painter [[John Everett Millais]] and [[Edward VII]], [[Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref name="RusArtNet"/&gt;

Aivazovsky's second wife, Anna Burnazian, was a young Armenian widow 40 years his junior.&lt;ref name="Obukhovska"/&gt; Aivazovsky said that by marrying her in 1882, he "became closer to [his] nation", referring to the Armenian people.{{sfn|Mikaelian|1991|p=63}}  In 1882, Aivazovsky visited Moscow and St Petersburg and then toured the countryside of Russia by traveling along the [[Volga River]] in 1884.&lt;ref name="RusArtNet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogachevsky"/&gt;

In 1885, he was promoted to the rank of [[Table of Ranks|Privy Councilor]]. The next year, the 50th anniversary of his creative labors, was celebrated with an exhibition in St Petersburg, and an honorary membership in the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts.&lt;ref name="tretyakovgallery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogachevsky"/&gt;

After traveling to Paris with his wife, in 1892 he made a trip to the United States, visiting [[Niagara Falls]] in New York and Washington D.C.&lt;ref name="Rogachevsky"/&gt; In 1896, at 79, Aivazovsky was promoted to the rank of full privy councillor.&lt;ref name="RusArtNet"/&gt;

Aivazovsky was deeply affected by the [[Hamidian massacres]] that took place in the Armenian-inhabited areas of the Ottoman Empire between 1894 and 1896. He painted a number of works on the subject such as ''The Expulsion of the Turkish Ship'', and ''The Armenian Massacres at Trebizond''. He threw the medals given to him by the Ottoman Sultan into the sea and told the Turkish consul in Feodosia: "Tell your bloodthirsty master that I've thrown away all the medals given to me, here are their ribbons, send it to him and if he wants, he can throw them into the seas painted by me."{{sfn|Harutiunian|1965|pp=90–91|ps=: "Բռնակալության դեմ ի նշան բողոքի, նա բոլոր շքանշանները նետում է ծովը և ապա երիտասարդի աշխուժությամբ դնում է թուրքական հյուպատոսի մոտ ու զայրացած ասում. «Արյունակզակ տիրոջդ ինձի տված պատվանշանները ծովր նետեցի, ահավասիկ անոնց ժապավենները, իրեն ղրկել եթե կուզե թող ինքն ալ իմ պատկերներս ծովը նետե, բայց հոդս չէ, վասն զի անոնց փոխարժեքը ստացուած եմ»։ Ու կը մեկնի։}} He created several painting on the events, such as ''The Massacre of Armenians in Trebizond'' (1895), ''Lonely Ship'', ''Night.

He spent his final years in Feodosia. In the 1890s, thanks to his efforts a [[:ru:Феодосийский морской торговый порт|commercial port]] was established in Feodosia and linked to the railway network of the Russian Empire.&lt;ref name="Obukhovska"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitmore"/&gt; The railway station, opened in 1892, is now called ''[[:ru:Айвазовская (станция)|Ayvazovskaya]]'' and is one of the two stations within the city of Feodosia.

He was able to reproduce what he had seen only for a very short time, without even drawing preliminary sketches."&lt;ref name="Rogachevsky"/&gt; Bolton praised "his ability to convey the effect of moving water and of reflected sun and moonlight."{{sfn|Bolton|2010|p=140}}

===Exhibitions===
He held 55 solo exhibitions (an unprecedented number)&lt;ref name="rusmuseum.ru"/&gt; over the course of his career. Among the most notable were held in Rome, Naples and Venice (1841–42), Paris (1843, 1890), Amsterdam (1844), Moscow (1848, 1851, 1886), Sevastopol (1854), Tiflis (1868), Florence (1874), St. Petersburg (1875, 1877, 1886, 1891), Frankfurt (1879), Stuttgart (1879), London (1881), Berlin (1885, 1890), Warsaw (1885), Constantinople (1888), New York (1893), Chicago (1893), San Francisco (1893).&lt;ref name="RusArtNet"/&gt;

===Style===
A primarily Romantic painter, Aivazovsky used some Realistic elements.{{sfn|Koorghinian|1967|p=189}} Leek argued that Aivazovsky remained faithful to Romanticism] throughout his life, "even though he oriented his work toward the Realist genre."{{sfn|Leek|2012|p=178}} His early works are influenced by his Academy of Arts teachers Maxim Vorobiev and [[Sylvester Shchedrin]].&lt;ref name="tretyakovgallery"/&gt; Classic painters like [[Salvator Rosa]], [[Jacob Isaacksz van Ruisdael]] and [[Claude Lorrain]] contributed to Aivazovsky's individual process and style.&lt;ref name="Ghazarian"/&gt; [[Karl Bryullov]], best known for his ''[[The Last Day of Pompeii]]'', "played an important part in stimulating Aivazovsky's own creative development," according to Bolton.{{sfn|Bolton|2010|p=140}}&lt;ref name="tretyakovgallery"/&gt; Aivazovsky's best paintings in the 1840s–1850s used a variety of colors and were both epic and romantic in theme.&lt;ref name="Ghazarian"/&gt; Newmarch suggested that by the mid-19th century the romantic features in Aivazovsky's work became "increasingly pronounced."&lt;ref name="athenaeum"/&gt; She, like most scholars, considered his ''Ninth Wave'' his best piece of art and argued that it "seems to mark the transition between fantastic color of his earlier works, and the more truthful vision of the later years."{{sfn|Newmarch|1917|p=191}} By the 1870s, his paintings were dominated by delicate colors; and in the last two decades of his life, Aivazovsky created a series of silver-toned seascapes.&lt;ref name="Ghazarian"/&gt;

The distinct transition in Russian art from Romanticism to Realism in the mid-nineteenth century left Aivazovsky, who would always retain a Romantic style, open to criticism. Proposed reasons for his unwillingness or inability to change began with his location; Feodosia was a remote town in the huge Russian empire, far from Moscow and Saint Petersburg. His mindset and worldview were similarly considered old-fashioned and did not correspond to the developments in Russian art and culture.&lt;ref name="Khachatrian"/&gt; [[Vladimir Stasov]] only accepted his early works, while [[Alexandre Benois]] wrote in his ''The History of Russian Painting in the 19th Century'' that despite being Vorobiev's student, Aivazovsky stood apart from the general development of the Russian landscape school.&lt;ref name="Khachatrian"/&gt;

Aivazovsky's later work contained dramatic scenes and was usually done on a larger scale. He depicted "the romantic struggle between man and the elements in the form of the sea (''The Rainbow'', 1873), and so-called "blue marines" (''The Bay of Naples in Early Morning'', 1897, ''Disaster'', 1898) and urban landscapes (''Moonlit Night on the Bosphorus'', 1894)."&lt;ref name="tretyakovgallery"/&gt;

====Armenian themes====
Aivazovsky's early works incorporated Armenian themes. The artist's longstanding wish to visit his ancestral homeland was fulfilled in 1868. During his visit to Russian (Eastern) Armenia (roughly corresponding to the modern [[Armenia]], as opposed to [[Western Armenia]] under Ottoman rule), Aivazovsky created paintings of [[Mount Ararat]], the [[Ararat plain]], and [[Lake Sevan]]. Although Mt. Ararat has been depicted in paintings of many non-native artists (mostly European travelers), Aivazovsky became the first Armenian artist to illustrate the two-peaked biblical mountain.&lt;!-- Մինչ այդ հայ նկարիչներից ոչ ոք չէր տվել Արարատը և Արարատյան դաշտը պատկերող կտավներ։ --&gt;{{sfn|Sarkssian|1963|p=28}}&lt;ref name="Khachatrian"/&gt;

He resumed the creation of Armenian-related paintings in the 1880s: ''Valley of Mount Ararat'' (1882), ''Ararat'' (1887), ''Descent of Noah from Ararat'' (1889).{{sfn|Sarkssian|1963|p=28}} The unique ''Valley of Mount Ararat'' contains Aivazovksy's signature in Armenian: "Aivazian" (Այվազեան).{{sfn|Sarkssian|1963|p=28}}{{sfn|Mikaelian|1991|p=63}} In a panorama of Venice expressed by ''Byron's Visit to the Mekhitarists on St Lazarus Island in Venice'' (1898); the foreground of the picture contains members of the Armenian Congregation giving an enthusiastic welcome to the poet.{{sfn|Cardwell|2005|p=402}}

His other themed works from this period include rare portraits of notable Armenians, such as his brother Archbishop Gabriel Aivazovsky ([[:File:Gabriel Aivazovsky.jpg|1882]]), Count [[Mikhail Loris-Melikov]] ([[:File:LorisMelikov Aivazovsky.jpg|1888]]), Catholicos [[Mkrtich Khrimian]] ([[:File:Aivazovsky - Catholicos Khrimyan Airik near Echmiadzin.jpg|1895]]), [[Nakhichevan-on-Don]] Mayor Аrutyun Khalabyan and others.{{sfn|Sarkssian|1963|p=28}}&lt;ref name="Khachatrian"/&gt;

''The Baptism of Armenians'' and ''Oath Before the Battle of Avarayr'' (both 1892) depict the two single most memorable events of ancient Armenia: the [[Christianization]] of Armenia via baptism of King [[Tiridates III of Armenia|Tiridates III]] (early 4th century), and the [[Battle of Avarayr]] of 451.&lt;ref name="Khachatrian"/&gt;

==Influence==
Aivazovsky was the most influential seascape painter in nineteenth-century Russian art.&lt;ref name="tretyakovgallery"/&gt; According to the [[Russian Museum]], "he was the first and for a long time the only representative of seascape painting" and "all other artists who painted seascapes were either his own students or influenced by him."&lt;ref name="rusmuseum.ru"/&gt;

[[Arkhip Kuindzhi]] (1841/2–1910) is cited by [[Krugosvet]] encyclopedia as having been influenced by Aivazovsky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Куинджи, Архип Иванович|url=http://www.krugosvet.ru/enc/kultura_i_obrazovanie/izobrazitelnoe_iskusstvo/KUINDZHI_ARHIP_IVANOVICH.html|publisher=[[Krugosvet]]|language=ru|quote=Испытал особое влияние И.К.Айвазовского.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, at age 13–14, Kuindzhi visited Feodosia to study with Aivazovsky, however, he was engaged merely to mix paints&lt;ref name="Bowlt"/&gt; and instead studied with Adolf Fessler, Aivazovsky's student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manin|first1=Vitaly|authorlink1=:ru:Манин, Виталий Серафимович|title=Архип Куинджи|date=2000|publisher=Belyĭ gorod|location=Moskva|isbn=978-5-7793-0219-7|page=6|language=ru|quote=в Феодосию к знаменитому Айвазовскому.

===In Russia===
In a July 2017 poll conducted by the [[Russian Public Opinion Research Center]] (VTsIOM) Aivazovsky ranked first as the most favorite artist with 27% of respondents naming him as their favorite, ahead of [[Ivan Shishkin]] (26%) and [[Ilya Repin]] (16%). Overall, 93% of respondents said they were familiar with his name (26% knew him well, 67% have heard his name) and 63% of those who know him said they liked his works, including 80% of those 60 or older and 35% of 18 to 24 year olds.&lt;ref name="2017poll"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://wciom.ru/index.php?id=236&amp;uid=116331&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890, the ''[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]'' described him as the "best Russian marine painter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]] Volume I|contribution=[[:ru:s:ЭСБЕ/Айвазовский, Гавриил Константинович|Айвазовский]]|date=1890|pages=242–243|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ivan Kramskoi]], one of the most prominent Russian artists of the nineteenth century, praised him thus: "Aivazovsky is—no matter who says what—a star of first magnitude, and not only in our [country], but also in history of art in general."&lt;!--"Айвазовский, кто бы и что ни говорил, есть звезда первой величины во всяком случае, не только у нас, а и в истории искусства вообще."--&gt;&lt;ref name="km.ru"/&gt; Another Russian painter, Alexandre Benois, suggested that "Aivazovsky stands apart from the general history of the Russian school of landscape painting."&lt;ref name="rusmuseum.ru"/&gt; The [[State Russian Museum]] website continues, "It is hard to find another figure in the history of Russian art enjoying the same popularity among amateur viewers and erudite professionals alike."&lt;ref name="rusmuseum.ru"/&gt; Writing in 1861 in the magazine ''[[Vremya (magazine)|Vremya]]'', [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] compared Aivazovsky's work with that of [[Alexandre Dumas]] as both artists "produce a remarkably striking effect: remarkable indeed, as neither man ever produces anything ordinary at all. Ordinary things, they despise. Their compositions are certainly quite fascinating. The books of Dumas were devoured with impatience; the paintings of Aivazovsky have been selling like hot cakes. Both produce works that are not dissimilar to fairy tales: fireworks, clatter, screams, howling winds, lightning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kalugina|first1=Natalya|title=Reporting Aivazovsky in 19th century Russian Periodicals|journal=[[Tretyakov Gallery|Tretyakov Gallery Magazine]]|date=2017|volume=54|issue=1|url=http://www.tretyakovgallerymagazine.com/articles/1-2017-54/reporting-aivazovsky-19th-century-russian-periodicals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nineteenth-century Russia, his name became a synonym for art and beauty. The phrase "worthy of Aivazovsky's brush" was the standard way of describing something ineffably lovely.

'''Library.nu''', previously called '''ebooksclub.org''' from 2004 to 2007 and '''gigapedia.com''' from 2007 to 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gigapedia: The greatest, largest and the best website for downloading eBooks|url=http://vikas-gupta.in/2009/08/10/gigapedia-the-greatest-largest-and-the-best-website-for-downloading-free-e-books/|accessdate=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a popular linking website. It was accused of [[copyright infringement]] and it was shut down by court order on February 15, 2012. According to the takedown notice, it hosted some 400,000 ebooks.

==Operators==
According to an article posted in the British ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', investigators believed that library.nu was operated by [[Ireland|Irish]] nationals, possibly from [[Galway]], through a server in [[Kiev]].&lt;ref&gt;"Irish-run website investigated over ebook piracy operation." [[Sunday Times]] [London, England] 18 Dec. 2011: 6. Academic OneFile. Web. 20 Dec. 2011.[http://pastebin.com/wd1ym2PB]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Injunction==
This website was targeted by coordinated legal action from 17 publishers who obtained an [[injunction]] from a [[Munich]] court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/08c911d4-57f4-11e1-ae89-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1nCt6bKWx|title=File sharers targeted over ebooks|work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/book-publishers-shut-down-library-nu-and-ifile-it-120215/|title=Book Publishers 'Shut Down' Library.nu and iFile-it - TorrentFreak|work=TorrentFreak}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the claimed infringing files were hosted on the iFile.it [[file hosting service]], whose representatives however disclaimed a close relationship with Library.nu. In contrast, a representative of a private intellectual property agency hired by the book publishers stated that the "owners and directors of iFile.it" were the persons whose names appeared on the receipts of [[PayPal]] donations to Library.nu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/15/librarynu-book-downloading-injunction_n_1280383.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Andrew | last=Losowsky | title=Book Downloading Site Targeted By Publishers | date=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[TorrentFreak]], "the legal team of the publishers estimated the revenue based on page impressions as well as estimated income from premium accounts, but this figure is laughable according to the iFile.it owner, which makes sense considering the site’s modest size." The iFile.it owner also told TorrentFreak that "they can barely cover the server costs with the revenue they make."&lt;ref name="tf"/&gt;

==Aftermath and alternative websites==
The URL "library.nu" was revoked by the [[.nu]] domain on 20 February 2012. Between the day of indictment and 24 February, library.nu redirected to [[Google Books]].

This '''list of books about skepticism''' is a skeptic's library of works centered on [[scientific skepticism]], [[religious skepticism]], [[critical thinking]], [[scientific literacy]], and refutation of claims of the [[paranormal]]. It also includes titles about [[atheism]], [[irreligion]], books for "young skeptics" and related subjects. It is intended as a starting point for research into these areas of study.

Collections in the realm of skepticism, science literacy, and [[freethought]] exist both online and in brick-and-mortar libraries. The complete works of [[Robert G. Ingersoll]] are available online at both the Secular Web&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Green Ingersoll Complete Works|url=http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/robert_ingersoll/|publisher=Secular Web|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as part of the [[Internet Archive]] project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Works of Robert G Ingersoll (1900)|url=https://archive.org/details/worksofrobertgin12inge|publisher=Internet Archive|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Drew University Library hosts a collection of pamphlets by and about Mr. Ingersoll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heise|first=Jennifer|title=Robert G.

'''Maya Deren''' (April 29, 1917 – October 13, 1961), born '''Eleonora Derenkowska''' ({{lang-ua|Елеоно́ра Деренко́вська|links=no}}), was a Ukrainian-born American filmmaker and one of the most important American experimental filmmakers and entrepreneurial promoters of the avant-garde in the 1940s and 1950s. Deren was also a choreographer, dancer, film theorist, poet, lecturer, writer, and photographer.

The function of film, Deren believed, like most art forms, was to create an experience; each one of her films would evoke new conclusions, rendering her oeuvre dynamic and always-evolving.&lt;ref name=anagram /&gt; She combined her interests in dance, Haitian Vodou and subjective psychology in a series of surreal, perceptual, black-and-white short films. Using editing, multiple exposures, jump cutting, superimposition, slow-motion, and other camera techniques to her fullest advantage, Deren created continued motion through discontinued space, while abandoning the established notions of physical space and time, with the ability to turn her vision into a [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]].

One of the most influential experimental films in American cinema was ''[[Meshes of the Afternoon]]'' (1943), her collaboration with [[Alexander Hammid]]. She went on to make several films of her own, including ''[[At Land]]'' (1944), ''A Study in Choreography for Camera'' (1945), and ''Ritual in Transfigured Time'' (1946), writing, producing, directing, editing, and photographing them with help from only one other person, Hella Heyman, her camerawoman.

==Early life==
Deren was born in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]] (then [[Russian Republic]]&lt;!--in April 1917 Kiev was part of the Russian Republic--&gt;), into a Jewish family, to psychologist Solomon Derenkowsky and Marie Fiedler, who supposedly named her after Italian actress [[Eleonora Duse]].

In 1922, the family fled the [[USSR]] because of anti-Semitic [[Kiev pogroms (1919)|pogroms]] perpetrated by the [[White movement|White Volunteer Army]]  and moved to [[Syracuse, New York]]. Her father shortened the family name to "Deren" shortly after they arrived in New York.&lt;ref name=Nichols&gt;{{Cite book |title=Maya Deren and the American Avant-Garde: Includes the complete text of An Anagram of Ideas on Art, Form, and Film |editor-first=Bill |editor-last=Nichols |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2001 |pages=3–10, 268}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the staff psychiatrist at the [[Syracuse State School|State Institute for the Feeble-Minded]] in Syracuse.

In 1928, she became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States. Her mother moved to [[Paris, France]] to be with her daughter while she attended the [[League of Nations]] [[International School of Geneva]] in Switzerland from 1930 to 1933.

Deren began college at [[Syracuse University]], where she studied journalism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/maya-deren |title=Maya Deren |website=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=August 28, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504210211/http://www.answers.com/topic/maya-deren |archivedate=May 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and political science, and also became a highly active socialist leader during the Trotskyist movement.&lt;ref name=Legend&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Legend of Maya Deren: a documentary biography and collected works.

She finished school at New York University with a bachelor's degree in literature in June 1936 then returned to Syracuse in the Fall. She and her husband became active in various [[socialist]] causes in New York City. She graduated from [[New York University]] with a bachelor's degree in literature&lt;ref name=Nichols /&gt; and separated from Bardacke. The divorce was finalized in 1939. She attended the [[New School for Social Research]] and received a master's degree in English literature at [[Smith College]]. Her [[thesis|master's thesis]] was titled ''The Influence of the French Symbolist School on Anglo-American Poetry'' (1939).

==Early career==
After graduation from Smith, Deren returned to New York's [[Greenwich Village]], where she joined the European [[émigré]] art scene. The following years from 1937–1939 were very formative of career as Deren supported herself by free-lance writing for radio shows and foreign language newspapers. During that time she also worked as an editorial assistant to famous American writers, [[Eda Lou Walton]], [[Max Eastman]], and then [[William Seabrook]].&lt;ref name="Legend" /&gt; She became known for her European-style handmade clothes, wild, curly hair, and fierce convictions.&lt;ref name=Nichols /&gt; In 1940, Deren moved to Los Angeles to focus on her poetry and free-lance photography. In 1941, Deren wrote and suggested a children's book on dance to African American dancer, choreographer, and anthropologist of Caribbean culture and dance [[Katherine Dunham]] and later became her assistant and publicist. Dunham's fieldwork influenced Deren's studies of Haitian culture and Voudoun mythology.&lt;ref name="Modern Women"&gt;{{cite book |first=Sally |last=Berger |title=Maya Deren's Legacy |editor1-last=Butler |editor1-first=Connie |journal=Modern Women |date=2010 |publisher=Museum of Modern Art |location=New York |page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of touring a new musical ''[[Cabin in the Sky (musical)|Cabin in the Sky]]'', the [[Katherine Dunham Company|Dunham dance company]] stopped in Los Angeles for several months to work in [[Hollywood]]. It was there that Deren met [[Alexandr Hackenschmied]] (later Hammid), a celebrated Czech-born photographer and cameraman who would become her second husband in 1942. Hackenschmied had fled from Czechoslovakia in 1938 after [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s advance. They lived together in [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles|Laurel Canyon]] where he helped her with her still photography which focused on local fruit pickers in Los Angeles.,&lt;ref name=Legend /&gt;

==Cinema==

===''Meshes of the Afternoon''===
In 1943, Deren purchased a used [[16 mm]] [[Bolex]] camera with some of the inheritance money after her father's death from a heart attack. This camera captured her first and best-known film, ''[[Meshes of the Afternoon]]'' (1943), made in their Los Angeles home on a budget of $250&lt;ref name="Athology Film Archive/Film Culture"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=VeVe A.|last2=Hudson|first2=Millicent|last3=Neiman|first3=Catrina|editor1-last=Melton|editor1-first=Hollis|title=The Legend of Maya Deren: A Documentary Biography and Collected Works|date=1988|publisher=Athology Film Archive/Film Culture|location=New York City|isbn=0-911689-17-6|edition=Volume 1 Part Two}}&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with Hammid. ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' is recognized as a seminal American avant-garde film. It is the first example of a narrative work in avant-garde American film; critics have seen autobiographical elements in the film, as well as thoughts about women and the individual. Originally a silent film with no dialogue, music for the film was composed by Deren's third husband [[Teiji Itō]] in 1952. The film can be described as an expressionistic "trance film," full of dramatic angles and innovative editing. It seems to investigate the ephemeral ways in which the protagonist's unconscious mind works and makes connections between objects and situations. A woman, played by Maya Deren, walks to her friend's house in Los Angeles, falls asleep and has a dream. The sequence of walking up to the gate on the partially shaded road restarts numerous times, resisting conventional narrative expectations, and ends in various situations inside the house. Movement from the wind, shadows and the music sustain the heartbeat of the dream. Certain symbols recur on the screen, including a cloaked, mirror-faced figure, and a key, which becomes twinned with a knife.

The loose repetition and rhythm cut short any expectation of a conventional narrative, heightening the dream-like qualities. The camera initially avoids her face, which precludes identification with a particular woman. Multiple selves appear, shifting between the first and third person, suggesting that the [[Id, ego and super-ego|super-ego]] is at play, which is in line with the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] staircase and flower motifs. This kind of Freudian interpretation, which she disagreed with, led Deren to add sound to the film composed by Teji Ito. Another interpretation is that each film is an example of a "personal film". Her first piece explores a woman's subjectivity and her relation to the external world. [[Georges Sadoul]] said Deren may have been "the most important figure in the post-war development of the personal, independent film in the U.S.A."&lt;ref name=letter&gt;{{Cite book |title=Women and the Cinema: A Critical Anthology |editor-first1=Karyn |editor-last1=Kay |editor-first2=Gerald |editor-last2=Peary |chapter=A Letter to James Card by Maya Deren |location=New York |publisher=Dutton |year=1977 |isbn=978-0-52547-459-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In featuring the filmmaker as the woman whose subjectivity in the domestic space is explored, the feminist dictum "the personal is political" is foregrounded. As with her other films on self-representation, Deren navigates conflicting tendencies of the self and the "other," through doubling, multiplication and merging of the woman in the film. Following a dreamlike quest with allegorical complexity, ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' has an enigmatic structure and a loose affinity with both film noir and domestic melodrama.&lt;ref name=Nichols /&gt; The film is famous for how it resonated with Deren's own life and anxieties. According to a review in ''The Moving Image, "'' this film emerges from a set of concerns and passionate commitments that are native to Deren's life and her trajectory. The first of these trajectories is Deren's interest in socialism during her youth and university years".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gadassik|first=Alla|date=2012-07-11|title=Meshes of the Afternoon (review)|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/480559|journal=The Moving Image|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=139–142|doi=10.1353/mov.2012.0015|issn=1542-4235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Director's Notes ====
There is no concrete information about the conception of ''Meshes of the Afternoon, ''just that Deren offered the poetic ideas and Hammid was able to turn them into visuals. Deren's initial concept began on the terms of a subjective camera, one that would show the point of view of herself without the aid of mirrors and would move as her eyes through spaces. According to the earliest program note, she describes ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' as'':''

&lt;blockquote&gt;This film is concerned with the interior experiences of an individual. It does not record an event which could be witnessed by other persons. Rather, it reproduces the way in which the subconscious of an individual will develop, interpret, and elaborate an apparently simple and casual incident into a critical emotional experience.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Influences ====
===== Jean Cocteau =====
''Meshes of the Afternoon'' resembles a French film called ''Blood of a Poet'' (1930) by Jean Cocteau. The film is a representation of the subjective point of view of the Cocteau's mind in which he grapples with the concepts of inner and outer reality. ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' and Cocteau's film share the same imagery in many instances, however, Deren repeatedly claimed to have never seen the film and denied any influence by Cocteau. After seeing Blood of a Poet for the first time, she actually became fond of Cocteau.&lt;ref name="Athology Film Archive/Film Culture"/&gt;

In the fall of 1945, Deren wrote to Victor Animatograph Corp. that she had seen the film multiple times now and expressed interest in publishing a commentary on it. The article was never written.&lt;ref name="Athology Film Archive/Film Culture"/&gt;

===== Dali and Buñuel =====
The surrealist background of Dali and Bunuel is a question of influence because of the surreal nature of ''Meshes of the Afternoon''. Bunuel's ''Un Chien Andalou'' (1928) is on the premier examples of film representing the structure of the subconscious.&lt;ref name="Athology Film Archive/Film Culture"/&gt;

Deren detested this comparison because of the surrealist movement's interest in the entertainment value of its subject more than its meaning. The form of ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' does not compare to Un Chien Andalou either.&lt;ref name="Athology Film Archive/Film Culture"/&gt;

=====Freud and Jung =====
Psychoanalysis of ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' from a Freudian viewer or Jungian viewer attempted to decode the symbolism in the film to uncover what Deren was saying about identity and sexuality. Deren adamantly objected her film undergoing analysis for its symbolism because for Deren, the objects in the film were just that, objects "whose value and meaning ids defined and confirmed by their actual function in the context of the film as a whole". Deren wanted her audiences to appreciate the art for its conscious value and spent a lot of her later career delivering lectures and writing essays on her film theory.&lt;ref name="Athology Film Archive/Film Culture"/&gt;

===== Alexander Hamid =====
Alexander Hamid's role in the creation of ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' is as cameraperson. Maya Deren made extensive storyboards for all of her films including camera movements and camera effects. She wrote about these techniques in professional filmmaking magazines. The ideas and execution of the film are fully attributable to Deren. Hamid also acknowledged Deren as the sole creator of Meshes of the Afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=VeVe A.|last2=Hudson|first2=Millicent|last3=Neiman|first3=Catrina|editor1-last=Melton|editor1-first=Hollis|title=The Legend of Maya Deren: A Documentary Biography and Collected Works|date=1988|publisher=Anthology Film Archive/Film Culture|location=New York City|isbn=0-911689-17-6|edition=Volume 1 Part Two}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''At Land''===
Deren filmed ''[[At Land]]'' in [[Port Jefferson, New York|Port Jefferson]] and [[Amagansett, New York]] in the summer of 1944. Taking on more of an environmental psychologist's perspective, Deren "externalizes the hidden dynamic of the external world...as if I had moved from a concern with the life of the fish, to a concern with the sea which accounts for the character of the fish and its life."&lt;ref name=letter /&gt; Maya Deren washes up on the shore of the beach, and climbs up a piece of driftwood that leads to a room lit by chandeliers, and one long table filled with men and women smoking. She seems to be invisible to the people as she crawls across the table, uninhibited; her body continues seamlessly again onto a new frame, crawling through foliage; following the flowing pattern of water on rocks; following a man across a farm, to a sick man in bed, through a series of doors, and finally popping up outside on a cliff. She shrinks in the wide frame as she walks farther away from the camera, up and down sand dunes, then frantically collecting rocks back on the shore. Her expression seems confused when she sees two women playing chess in the sand. She runs back through the entire sequence, and because of the jump-cuts, it seems as though she is a double or "doppelganger," where her earlier self sees her other self running through the scene. Some of her movements are controlled, suggesting a theatrical, dancer-like quality, while some have an almost animalistic sensibility as she crawls through the seemingly foreign environments. This is one of Deren's films in which the focus is on the character's exploration of her own subjectivity in her physical environment, inside as well as outside her subconscious, although it has a similar amorphous quality compared to her other films.

===''A Study in Choreography for Camera''===
In the spring of 1945 she made ''[[A Study in Choreography for Camera]],'' which Deren said was "an effort to isolate and celebrate the principle of the power of movement."&lt;ref name=letter /&gt; The compositions and varying speeds of movement within the frame inform and interact with Deren's meticulous edits and varying film speeds and motions to create a dance that Deren said could only exist on film. Excited by the way the dynamic of movement is greater than anything else within the film, Maya established a completely new sense of the word "geography" as the movement of the dancer transcends and manipulates the ideas of both time and space.&lt;ref name=letter /&gt; Running at just under 3 minutes long, ''A Study in Choreography for Camera'' is a fragment but also a carefully constructed exploration of a man who dances in a forest, and then seems to teleport to the inside of a house because of how continuous his movements are from one place to the next. The choreography is perfectly synched as he seamlessly appears in an outdoor courtyard and then returns to an open, natural space. It shows a progression from nature to the confines of society, and back to nature. The figure belongs to dancer and choreographer [[Talley Beatty]], whose last movement is a leap across the screen back to the natural world. The edit its broken, choppy, showing different angles and compositions, and even with parts in slow-motion, Deren is able to keep the quality of the leap smooth and seemingly uninterrupted.

===''Ritual in Transfigured Time''===
By her fourth film, Deren discussed in ''An Anagram'' that she felt special attention should be given to unique possibilities of time and that the form should be ritualistic as a whole. ''Ritual in Transfigured Time'' began in August and was completed in 1946. It explored the fear of rejection and the freedom of expression in abandoning ritual, looking at the details as well as the bigger ideas of the nature and process of change. The main roles were played by Deren and the dancers [[Rita Christiani]] and Frank Westbrook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Maya Deren and the American Avant-Garde |editor-last=Nichols |editor-first=Bill |publisher=University of California Press |date=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NA8a2jbCUTcC&amp;pg=PP12&amp;lpg=PP12&amp;dq=Rita+Christiani+%2B+Nichols&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cO22FS6JPH&amp;sig=pcRGbPlP9kb3AEfKu5cSd2Q4P7Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV4eam_K7WAhUHqFQKHb5UBeEQ6AEIRjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Rita%20Christiani%20%2B%20Nichols&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-52022-732-3 |page=141 |accessdate=September 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Meditation on Violence''===
Deren's ''Meditation on Violence'' was made in 1948. [[Chao-Li Chi]]'s performance obscures the distinction between violence and beauty. It was an attempt to "abstract the principle of ongoing metamorphosis," found in ''Ritual in Transfigured Time,'' though Deren felt it was not as successful in the clarity of that idea, brought down by its philosophical weight.&lt;ref name=letter /&gt; Halfway through the film, the sequence is rewound, producing a film loop.

==Film career==
Deren defined cinema as an art, provided an intellectual context for film viewing, and filled a theoretical gap for the kinds of independent films societies were featuring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Points of Resistance: Women, Power &amp; Politics in the New York Avant-garde Cinema, 1934-1971|last=Rabinowitz|first=Lauren|publisher=Urbana: University of Illinois Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=Urbana|pages=49–91|chapter=Maya Deren and an American Avant-garde Cinema}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her entrepreneurial spirit became evident as she began to screen and distribute her films in the United States, Canada, and Cuba, lecturing and writing on avant-garde film theory, and [[Haitian Vodou|Vodoun]] as well. In February 1946 she booked the Village's Provincetown Playhouse for a major public exhibition, titled ''Three Abandoned Films'', in which she showed ''[[Meshes of the Afternoon]],'' ''[[At Land]],'' and ''A Study in Choreography for the Camera.'' The event was completely sold out, inspiring [[Amos Vogel]]'s formation of [[Cinema 16]], the most successful film society of the 1950s.

In 1946, she was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] for "Creative Work in the Field of Motion Pictures," and won the Grand Prix Internationale for 16mm [[experimental film]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] for ''[[Meshes of the Afternoon]].'' She then created a scholarship for experimental filmmakers, the Creative Film Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/158493/Maya-Deren |title=Maya Deren &amp;#124; biography - American director and actress |website=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Deren collaborated with the [[Metropolitan Opera]] Ballet School and [[Antony Tudor]] to create ''The Very Eye of Night''.

Deren was a muse and inspiration to such up-and-coming avant-garde filmmakers as [[Curtis Harrington]], [[Stan Brakhage]], and [[Kenneth Anger]], who emulated her independent, entrepreneurial spirit. Her influence can also be seen in films by [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Barbara Hammer]], and [[Su Friedrich]].&lt;ref name="Modern Women"/&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1943, she moved to a bungalow on Kings Road in Hollywood&lt;ref name=Legend /&gt; and adopted the name Maya, a pet name her husband Hammid coined. Maya is the name of the mother of the historical [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] as well as the [[dharmic]] concept of the illusory nature of reality. In Greek myth, [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]] is the mother of [[Hermes]] and a goddess of mountains and fields.

In 1944, back in New York City, her social circle included [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[André Breton]], [[John Cage]], and [[Anaïs Nin]]. In 1944, Deren filmed ''[[The Witch's Cradle]]'' in [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s [[Art of This Century gallery]] with Duchamp featured in the film, and possibly assisting her in the direction of the film.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Many friends described her look as that of an exotic Russian Jew,{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} contributing a part of her attractiveness to her [[bohemian]], Greenwich Village lifestyle. In the December 1946 issue of ''Esquire'' magazine, a caption for her photograph teased that she "experiments with motion pictures of the subconscious, but here is finite evidence that the lady herself is infinitely photogenic."&lt;ref name=persona&gt;{{cite journal |title=Performance and Persona in the U.S. Avant-Garde: The Case of Maya Deren |first=Maria |last=Pramaggiore |journal=Cinema Journal |volume=36 |number=2 |date=Winter 1997 |pages=17–40 |publisher=University of Texas Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her third husband, [[Teiji Ito]] said "Maya was always a Russian. In [[Haiti]] she was a Russian. She was always dressed up, talking, speaking many languages and being a Russian."&lt;ref name=persona /&gt;

==Criticism of Hollywood==
Throughout the 1940s and 50s, Deren attacked Hollywood for its artistic, political and economic monopoly over American cinema. She stated, "I make my pictures for what Hollywood spends on lipstick," and observed that Hollywood "has been a major obstacle to the definition and development of motion pictures as a creative fine-art form." She set herself in opposition to the Hollywood film industry's standards and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Timeline at 2010 MoMA exhibit.&lt;/ref&gt;
Deren talks about the freedoms of independent cinema:

{{Quote|text=Artistic freedom means that the amateur filmmaker is never forced to sacrifice visual drama and beauty to a stream of words...to the relentless activity and explanations of a plot...nor is the amateur production expected to return profit on a huge investment by holding the attention of a massive and motley audience for 90 minutes...Instead of trying to invent a plot that moves, use the movement of wind, or water, children, people, elevators, balls, etc. as a poem might celebrate these. And use your freedom to experiment with visual ideas; your mistakes will not get you fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Maya |last=Deren |title=Amateur Versus Professional |journal=Film Culture |number=39 |year=1965 |pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Haiti and Vodou==
When Maya Deren decided to make an ethnographic film in [[Haiti]], she was criticized for abandoning avant-garde film where she had made her name, but she was ready to expand to a new level as an artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6PHliJESxjYC&amp;dq=maya+deren+and+the+american+avantgarde&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Panq5wgSrf&amp;sig=-_doFxuxSE8d4f8nGLp3ICAVQLM&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=gbHhSpiSDoGL-QbxrJjZAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CA4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=moira%20sullivan&amp;f=false |chapter=Maya Deren's Ethnographic Representation of Ritual and Magic in Haiti |first=Moira |last=Sullivan |pages=207–229 |title=Maya Deren and the American Avantgarde |editor-last=Nichols |editor-first=Bill |publisher=University of California Press |year=2001 |accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nichols (2001), page 18. According to Nichols, "Taking up another neglected dimension of Maya Deren's work, Moira Sullivan's "Maya Deren's Ethnographic Representation of Ritual and Magic in Haiti" relies on primary source material in the Maya Deren Archive in Boston and Anthology Film Archives in New York."&lt;/ref&gt; She had studied ethnographic footage by [[Gregory Bateson]] in [[Bali]] in 1947, and was interested in including it in her next film.&lt;ref name=Legend /&gt; In September she divorced Hammid and left for a nine-month stay in Haiti. The [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] grant in 1947 enabled Deren to finance her travel and complete her film ''Meditation on Violence.'' She went on three additional trips through 1954 to document and record the rituals of [[Haitian Vodou]].

A source of inspiration for ritual dance was [[Katherine Dunham]] who wrote her master's thesis on Haitian dances in 1939, which Deren edited. Afterwards Deren wrote several articles on religious possession in dancing before her first trip to Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;A list of these articles are found in : Sullivan, 1997, pp.199-218.&lt;/ref&gt; Deren not only filmed, recorded and photographed many hours of Vodou [[ritual]], but also participated in the ceremonies. She documented her knowledge and experience of Vodou in ''Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti'' (New York: Vanguard Press, 1953), edited by [[Joseph Campbell]], which is considered a definitive source on the subject. She described her attraction to Vodou possession ceremonies, transformation, dance, play, games and especially ritual came from her strong feeling on the need to decenter our thoughts of self, ego and personality.&lt;ref name=Nichols /&gt; In her book ''An Anagram of Ideas on Art, Form, and Film'' she wrote:

{{Quote|text=The ritualistic form treats the human being not as the source of the dramatic action, but as a somewhat depersonalized element in a dramatic whole. The intent of such depersonalization is not the deconstruction of the individual; on the contrary, it enlarges him beyond the personal dimension and frees him from the specializations and confines of personality. He becomes part of a dynamic whole which, like all such creative relationships, in turn, endow its parts with a measure of its larger meaning.&lt;ref name=anagram&gt;{{Cite book |title=An Anagram of Ideas on Art, Form and Film |first=Maya |last=Deren |publisher=The Alicat Bookshop Press |year=1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Deren filmed 18,000 feet of Vodou rituals and people she met in Haiti. The footage was incorporated into a posthumous documentary film ''[[Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti (film)|Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti]]'', edited and produced in 1977 (with funding from Deren's friend [[James Merrill]]) by Teiji Itō (1935-1982) and his wife Cherel Winett Itō (1947–1999).&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan in Nichols (2001), pp.207-229.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Program notes" from screening at [[Pacific Film Archive]] at UC Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paganopoulos |first=M. |chapter=The Archetype of Transformation in Maya Deren's Film Rituals |title=Jung and Film II |editor1-first=Christopher |editor1-last=Hauke |editor2-first=Luke |editor2-last=Hockley |year=2011 |publisher=Routledge |pages=253–265}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the original wire recordings, photographs and notes are held in the Maya Deren Collection at the [[Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center]] at [[Boston University]]. The film footage is housed at [[Anthology Film Archives]] in New York City.

An [[LP record|LP]] of some of Deren's wire recordings was published by the newly formed [[Elektra Records]] in 1953 entitled ''Voices of Haiti''. The cover art for the album was by Teiji Ito.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.atsf.co.uk/elektra/discography.php?from=10&amp;to=340 |title=Master Discography |website=Elektra Records}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists Melville Herkovitz and Harold Courlander acknowledged the importance of ''Divine Horsemen,'' and in contemporary studies it is often cited as an authoritative voice, where Deren's methodology has been especially praised because "Vodou has resisted all orthodoxies, never mistaking surface representations for inner realities." &lt;ref&gt;Cosentino, ed., ''Sacred Arts of Vodou'', p.xii. Cited by Sullivan in Nichols (2001), p.225.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book of the same name,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Deren |first=M. |title=The Voodoo Gods |year=1975 |publisher=Paladin |pages=26 &amp; 305}} (A reprint of ''Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti.'')&lt;/ref&gt; Deren uses the spelling,'Voudoun,' explaining: "Voudoun terminology, titles and ceremonies still make use of the original African words and in this book they have been spelled out according to usual English phonetics and so as to render, as closely as possible, the Haitian pronunciation. Most of the songs, sayings and even some of the religious terms, however, are in [[Haitian Creole|Creole]], which is primarily French in derivation (although it also contains African, Spanish and Indian words). Where the Creole word retains its French meaning, it has been written out so as to indicate both the original French word and the distinctive Creole pronunciation." In her Glossary of Creole Words, Deren includes 'Voudoun' while the ''Shorter Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Shorter Oxford English Dictionary |edition=3rd |year=1973}} See also: [[Haitian Vodou]].&lt;/ref&gt; draws attention to the similar French word, ''Vaudoux.''

==Death==
Deren died in 1961, at the age of 44, from a [[brain hemorrhage]] brought on by extreme malnutrition. Her condition may have also been weakened by her long-term dependence on [[amphetamines]] and sleeping pills prescribed by Dr. [[Max Jacobson]], an arts scene doctor notorious for his liberal prescription of drugs,&lt;ref name=Nichols /&gt; who later became famous as one of [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]]'s physicians. Her father suffered from [[hypertension]], which she may also have had.

Her ashes were scattered in Japan at [[Mount Fuji]].

==Legacy==
&lt;!--Maya Deren had a passionate sense of social commitment and moral purpose that distinguished her from the less favorable values of the entertainment industry; from the indifferent, ironic attitudes of her surrealist and dada predecessors; from the cool, hip attitudes of her Beat successors; from the passive aesthetic of stylized filmmakers; and from the pretentious attitudes of contemporary film theorists.&lt;ref name=Nichols /&gt; Early political Socialist activism served as the base for Deren's organizational and creative endeavors; her pursuit of art was grounded in her strong ethical, moral and social convictions.&lt;ref name=anagram /&gt;
--&gt;
Deren was a key figure in the creation of a New American Cinema, highlighting personal, experimental, underground film. In 1986, the [[American Film Institute]] created the [[Maya Deren Award]] to honor independent filmmakers.

''The Legend of Maya Deren, Vol. 1 Part 2'' consists of hundreds of documents, interviews, oral histories, letters, and autobiographical memoirs.&lt;ref name=Nichols /&gt;

Works about Deren and her works have been produced in various media:
* In 1987, Jo Ann Kaplan directed a biographical documentary about Deren, titled ''Invocation: Maya Deren'' (65 min)
* In 1994, the UK-based [[Horse and Bamboo Theatre]] created and toured ''Dance of White Darkness'' throughout Europe—the story of Deren's visits to Haiti.
* In 2002, Martina Kudlacek directed a feature-length documentary about Deren, titled ''[[In the Mirror of Maya Deren]]'' (''Im Spiegel der Maya Deren''), which featured music by [[John Zorn]].

Deren's films have also been shown with newly written alternative soundtracks:
* In 2004, the British rock group [[Subterraneans (band)|Subterraneans]] produced new soundtracks for six of Deren's short films as part of a commission from [[Queens University Belfast|Queen's University Belfast]]'s annual [[Belfast Film Festival|film festival]]. ''At Land'' won the festival prize for sound design.
* In 2008, the Portuguese rock group [[Mão Morta]] produced new soundtracks for four of Deren's short films as part of a commission from Curtas Vila do Conde's annual film festival.

== Written works ==
Deren was also an important film theorist. 
* Her most widely read essay on film theory is probably ''An Anagram of Ideas on Art, Form and Film'', Deren's seminal treatise that laid the groundwork for many of her ideas on film as an art form (Yonkers, NY: Alicat Book Shop Press, 1946).
* Her collected essays were published&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mcphersonco.com/cs.php?f[0]=shh&amp;sl[br][NR]=9&amp;sl[br][SR]=2&amp;sl[br][cgID]=5&amp;pdID=142 |title=Essential Deren: Collected Writings on Film |publisher=McPherson &amp; Co |year=2005 |isbn=0-929701-65-8 |accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005 and arranged in three sections:
# ''Film Poetics'', including: Amateur versus Professional, Cinema as an Art Form, An Anagram of Ideas on Art, Form and Film, Cinematography: The Creative Use of Reality
# ''Film Production'', including: Creating Movies with a New Dimension: Time, Creative Cutting, Planning by Eye, Adventures in Creative Film-Making
# ''Film in Medias Res'', including: A Letter, Magic is New, New Directions in Film Art, Choreography for the Camera, Ritual in Transfigured Time, Meditation on Violence, The Very Eye of Night.
* ''Divine Horsemen: Living Gods of Haiti'' was published in 1953 by Vanguard Press (New York City) and Thames &amp; Hudson (London), republished under the title of ''The Voodoo Gods'' by Paladin in 1975, and again under its original title by McPherson &amp; Company in 1998.

'''Mira Schor''' (born June 1, 1950) is an American artist, writer, editor, and educator, known for her contributions to [[art criticism|critical discourse]] on the status of [[painting]] in [[contemporary art]] and culture as well as to [[feminist art movement|feminist art]] history and criticism.

==Early life and education==
Mira Schor's parents [[Ilya Schor|Ilya]] and [[Resia Schor]] were [[Poles|Polish-born]] artists who came to the US in 1941.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fry|first=Naomi|date=2010-2011|title=A Mind in a Body in a Landscape.|url=http://search.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.pratt.edu:2048/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=asu&amp;AN=54599486&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Provincetown Arts|volume=25|pages=44–51|via=EBSCO Art &amp; Architecture Source}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mira Schor and her older sister [[Naomi Schor]] (1943–2001), a noted scholar of [[French literature|French Literature]] and [[Feminist theory]], were both educated at the [[Lycée français de New York|Lycée Français de New York]]. After receiving her [[Baccalauréat]] in 1967, Mira Schor studied [[art history]] at [[New York University]] (WSC&lt;!-- what does this stand for? --&gt; [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] 1970). During this time she worked as an assistant to [[Red Grooms]] and [[Mimi Gross]]. She attended the [[CalArts|California Institute of the Arts (CalArts)]] from 1972-1973, receiving a [[Master of Fine Arts|Master of Fine Arts degree]] in Painting from in 1973.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There she was a participant in the CalArts Feminist Art Program’s renowned project [[Womanhouse]] (1972). In the Feminist Art Program she studied with [[Miriam Schapiro|Miriam Shapiro]] and [[Judy Chicago]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Later at CalArts she studied with [[Los Angeles]]-born sculptor Stephan Von Huene.

==Painting==
Schor’s visual work balances political and theoretical concerns with formalist and material passions. Her work has included major periods in which gendered narrative and representation of the body has been featured, but the predominant focus of her work has been representation of language in [[drawing]] and [[painting]]. Her paintings have been foregrounded by these various disciplines: by painting, with shows such as "Slow Art: Painting in New York Now," at [[P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center]]; by [[feminist art|feminism]], with exhibitions such as "Sexual Politics: [[The Dinner Party|Judy Chicago's 'Dinner Party']] in Feminist Art History," at the [[Hammer Museum|Armand Hammer Museum]]; and by language, with shows such as "Poetry Plastique," at [http://www.marianneboeskygallery.com/ Marianne Boesky Gallery] in New York.

In the 1980s and 90s, Schor's work was also exhibited in New York at the Edward Thorp Gallery, Horodner Romley Gallery, and in group exhibitions including at the [[Santa Monica Museum of Art|Santa Monica Museum]], the Armand Hammer Museum, The Neuberger Museum, and the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum|Aldrich Museum]]. Her visual work and her writings are included in ''Art and Feminism'' (2001) and ''Sexual Politics: Judy Chicago’s Dinner Party in Feminist Art History'' (1996). In 2009 Schor exhibited her work at [http://www.momentaart.org Momenta Art] in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], in a [[solo exhibition]] entitled "Suddenly," marking a departure in Schor's work, from the depiction of language as image to the suggestion of its lack in a space where we expect to see it. A solo exhibition, [http://www.cb1gallery.com/exhibitions/mira-schor-paintings-from-nineties-to-now.html "Mira Schor: Paintings From the Nineties To Now,"] was held at [http://www.cb1gallery.com CB1 Gallery] in Los Angeles, CA (November 20, 2010 – January 9, 2011) with a [http://www.cb1gallery.com/files/Mira-Schor-brochure.pdf catalogue essay] by art historian [[Amelia Jones]]. Schor exhibited her work at Marvelli Gallery [http://www.marvelligallery.com/Exhibition_MS_VoiceandSpeech_01.html] in 2012. In 2009 painter and critic Robert Berlind wrote, "An intimist whose candor is akin to Emily Dickinson’s.".&lt;ref&gt;"Exhibition Reviews: Mira Schor, Momenta Art," Art in America, June–July, 2009, 199, repro. 198&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2012 ''New York Times'' review, critic Roberta Smith wrote "Mira Schor’s small, sharp, quirky paintings have been thorns in the side of the medium for more than three decades now" and "Ms. Schor hardly tells the whole story of creative labor, but she lays out its essential elements: the isolation, reading, thinking and percolation that enable a Voice to emerge. At once poetic, lyrical and oddly real, her paintings give rare and sardonic visual form to the life, and the work, of the mind".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/27/arts/design/mira-schor-voice-and-speech.html?_r=0]&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews of Schor's recent exhibitions have been published in [[Art in America]]&lt;ref&gt;Constance Mallinson, Reviews, Mira Schor, ''Art in America'', April 2011, p.131&lt;/ref&gt; and on Artforum.com.

==Writing and Scholarship==

Schor has written frequently on issues of gender representation, including "Backlash and Appropriation," a chapter of ''The Power of Feminist Art'', 1994, an historical overview of the [[feminist art movement|Feminist movement]] published by [[Abrams Books|Abrams]], "Patrilineage", 2002, republished in ''The Feminism and Visual Culture Reader'' edited by [[Amelia Jones]], and on artists such as [[Ida Applebroog]], [[Mary Kelly (artist)|Mary Kelly]], and [[Ana Mendieta]]. Schor is the author of ''Wet: On Painting, Feminism, and Art Culture'', 1997, and co-founder and co-editor, with [[Susan Bee]], of ''[[M/E/A/N/I/N/G]]: Contemporary Art Issues'' publishing 20 issues from 1986-1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1986|title=M/e/a/n/i/n/g: contemporary art issues.|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/820167747|journal=M/e/a/n/i/n/g : contemporary art issues.|language=English|issn=1040-8576}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online version of the journal, [http://writing.upenn.edu/pepc/meaning/ M/E/A/N/I/NG Online] was launched in 2000 (the final issue, no. 7 was published in 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Duke Univ Pr| isbn = 978-0-8223-2566-6| last = Drucker| first = Johanna| others = Susan Bee, Mira Schor (eds.)| title = M/E/A/N/I/N/G: An Anthology of Artists' Writings, Theory, and Criticism| location = Durham, NC| date = 2000-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''M/E/A/N/I/N/G'' ''An Anthology of Artists’ Writings, Theory, and Criticism'', was published by Duke University Press in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/491620029|title=M/E/A/N/I/N/G an anthology of artists' writings, theory, and criticism|last=Bee|first=Susan|last2=Schor|first2=Mira|last3=Drucker|first3=Johanna|date=2000|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0822325349|location=Durham; London|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schor has sometimes been criticized for taking an [[Essentialism|essentialist position]] in terms of feminism and many of her writings take on this debate. In her writings on paintings in essays such as "Figure/Ground," 2001, Schor is seen as making a case for the relevance of painting in a post-medium [[visual culture]] and for arguing for the compatibility and mutuality of painterly and theoretical practices.

In 2003, Schor produced a [[video documentary]] on her parents’ work, ''[[The Tale of the Goldsmith’s Floor]]'', originally created for the 2003 Brown University and ''differences'' conference, "The Lure of the Detail"&lt;ref&gt;"The Tale of The Goldsmith’s Floor," an illustrated video script, appears in ''differences'', Vol. 14, Number 3, Fall 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Schor was awarded the [http://artswriters.org/grantees_2009.html Creative Capital / Warhol Foundation Arts Writers Grant] to develop [http://ayearofpositivethinking.com/ A Year of Positive Thinking], a blog on contemporary art in 2009.

In 2010 she delivered a lecture called "On Failure and Anonymity" for a collaborative project called ''[[hashtagclass|#class]]'' at Winkleman Gallery in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Walter. [http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/news/artnetnews/hashtagclass-skin-fruit2-18-10.asp “Art Show as Think Tank”]. Artnet.com. February 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil''' is one of the [[National Film Awards]] presented annually by the [[Directorate of Film Festivals]], the organisation set up by [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, India]]. It is one of several awards presented for feature films and awarded with Rajat Kamal (Silver Lotus).

The [[National Film Awards]], established in 1954, are the most prominent film awards in India that merit the best of the [[Indian cinema]]. The ceremony also presents awards for films in various [[Languages of India|regional languages]].

Awards for films in seven regional language ([[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]]) started from [[2nd National Film Awards]] which were presented on 21 December 1955. Three awards of "President's Silver Medal for Best Feature Film", "Certificate of Merit for the Second Best Feature Film" and "Certificate of Merit for the Third Best Feature Film" were instituted. The later two certificate awards were discontinued from [[15th National Film Awards]] (1967).

The 1954 film, directed by [[S. M. Sriramulu Naidu]], ''[[Malaikkallan]]'' was honoured with the first president's Silver Medal for Best Feature Film in Tamil. Certificate of Merit for Second and Third Best Feature Films in Tamil were received by ''[[Andha Naal]]'' and ''[[Edhir Paradhathu]]'' respectively.

The '''North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop (NESW)''' is an [[artist collective]], or [[artist-run initiative]], centred on a co-operative shared studio in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], focused on "the creation and promotion of ambitious [[contemporary]] [[sculpture]] made using [[industrial engineering|industrial]] processes and materials".&lt;ref name="PS"&gt;[http://prairieseen.tumblr.com/post/74426438934/profiles-edmonton-art-institutions-societies "Profiles: Edmonton Art Institutions (Societies, Foundations, Associations etc.)", PrairieSeen, September 18, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010092410/http://prairieseen.tumblr.com/post/74426438934/profiles-edmonton-art-institutions-societies |date=October 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TI"&gt;[https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/gec-travel-information/GTgJ2wIq5dY Travel Information: Artists' Studio]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmontonculturalcapital.com/links.asp "Links to Arts, Cultural Listings and Information", Cultural Capital of Canada, Edmonton 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avenueedmonton.com/City-Life/Top-40-Under-40/Ryan-McCourt/ "Ryan McCourt: Top 40 Under 40", Avenue Edmonton]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“War, Peace Among Themes of Sculpture Exhibition”, Gilbert Bouchard, Edmonton Journal, July 8, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ST"&gt;[http://spectatortribune.com/prairie-daily-winnipeg-architects-99-red-balloons-saskatchewan-pet-owners-take-diy-too-far-calgary-food-drive-and-edmontons-scrap-metal-sculptors/ "Prairie Daily: Winnipeg architect’s 99 red balloons, Saskatchewan pet owners take DIY too far, Calgary food drive, and Edmonton’s scrap metal sculptors," Chad Cawson, Spectator Tribune, November 2, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; The NESW name makes a symbolic reference to the [[cardinal directions]] in allusion to the idea of boundless exploration.&lt;ref name="BIG2"&gt;"Big Spaces For Big Sculptures," Janice Ryan, Studio Inside, Edmonton Journal, November 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop was founded in 2002, with sculptors Mark Bellows, [[Andrew French (sculptor)|Andrew French]], and [[Ryan McCourt]] as the resident artists. In its first year, the NESW produced four exhibitions in four different venues: "''Front Room Sculpture''" at [[Harcourt House, Edmonton|Harcourt House]]; "''North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop''" at Global Visions Film Festival; "''Desperate Measures''" with [[The Works Art &amp; Design Festival|The Works Society]]; and "''[[Big Things]]''" at the [[Royal Alberta Museum]].&lt;ref name="TI" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Bouchard, “Come to Expect ‘Big Things’”, Edmonton Journal, July 19, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erik Floren, “Big Impressions”, The Edmonton Sunday Sun, July 28, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RAM"&gt;[http://www.royalalbertamuseum.ca/exhibits/past.cfm Past Exhibits, Royal Alberta Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sculptures by the North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop artists appeared in another 2002 Harcourt House exhibition: "Edmonton Sculpture: The Next Generation", an Edmonton sculpture survey show curated by Canadian artist, curator and critic [[Terry Fenton]].&lt;ref&gt;Mike Winters, "Fitting into the Modernist Mould," SEE Magazine, Issue #455, August 12–21, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In his accompanying essay, Fenton singles out the NESW artists:

"''[[Andrew French (sculptor)|Andrew French]], Mark Bellows, and [[Ryan McCourt]] share a studio, giving them the double advantage of being removed from the student environment while retaining continued access to one another for stimulation and criticism. This does not amount to their charting a common course. If anything, the shared studio has confirmed them in separate directions: the hothouse atmosphere appears to have stimulated both invention and individuality. Their work seems to be getting closer to the source of their inspiration, French's into the occupation of space by brute force, Bellows into a poetry of volume, McCourt into elegant profiles''".&lt;ref&gt;"Edmonton Sculpture: The Next Generation," Terry Fenton, Harcourt Expressed, Volume 12, Summer/Fall 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ACSE RAM.jpg|thumb|The sculptures on display at the Alberta Centennial Sculpture Exhibition at the Royal Alberta Museum in 2005.]]
The success of the North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop's first [[Big Things]] exhibition&lt;ref&gt;Mike Berezowsky, “Sculpture Exhibit Gets a Big Response”, Edmonton Examiner, September 11, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; would lead to three more presentations in the series: Big Things 2 in 2003, Big Things 3 in 2004, and Big Things 4 in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;“Bianca Khan's One-Tonne Challenge”, Gilbert Bouchard, Edmonton Journal, July 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, in celebration of Alberta's centennial year, and the Museum's new [[Royal Charter]] from [[Queen Elizabeth II]],&lt;ref name="RAM" /&gt; the North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop presented the Alberta Centennial Sculpture Exhibition at the newly named [[Royal Alberta Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Olenka Melnyk, “Big Sculpture, Bigger Worries Burden Artists”, Edmonton Journal, July 12, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

== New Directions ==
Mark Bellows left the studio in 2005, while [[Robert Willms]] joined the NESW that same year.&lt;ref name="TI" /&gt; In 2007, the North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop moved into a large new facility, with 2100 square feet working space, concrete floors, 20-foot ceilings, and a 2,800-square-foot yard.&lt;ref name="ST" /&gt; As the Royal Alberta Museum grounds were unavailable to the group that year, the NESW exhibited "New Directions," a show of smaller works, at the Stollery Gallery in Edmonton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/whatson/story.html?id=a9396ebb-41b3-43e3-a425-564e244d4140 "Multiple Directions Merge In Single Exhibit”, Edmonton Journal, October 5, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon touring the North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop in 2008, Edmonton arts writer Amy Fung called the studio "''essentially an artist’s [[wet dream]] in our space-deprived city.''" In her view, the NESW was "''certainly more impressive in size and facilities than existing local [[Artist run centre|ARCs]] and arts initiatives such as ArtsHabitat''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vueweekly.com/prairie_artsters_a_different_kind_of_arc/ "Prairie Artsters - A Different Kind of ARC", Amy Fung, Vue Weekly, July 10, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop presented "AUTOGRAPH: Sculpture and Drawing by Rob Willms",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=a89724b5-c211-4cdc-b1fd-fb1f549733a2 "Museums and Galleries", Edmonton Journal, March 21, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; the inaugural exhibition in Common Sense, their new gallery space; and "Peter Hide @ The RAM," an exhibition of major works by Hide on the [[Royal Alberta Museum]]'s outdoor [[sculpture]] patio.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.ca/Iron-Bridge-Sculptors-Life-Peter/dp/1926710401 Iron Bridge: A sculptor's Life, Peter Hide", Piri Halasz, Nov 5 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2012 [[Edmonton Journal]] profile on the NESW, their ground level studio at 10546 - 115th street has 2100 square feet of concrete floor space, 20-foot-high ceilings, and a ten-foot by fourteen-foot sliding door that leads to a 2800-square-foot storage yard. Resident sculptors in 2012 include [[Ryan McCourt]], Mark Bellows, [[Andrew French (sculptor)|Andrew French]], Stephen Pardy and [[Robert Willms]]. From 2008 to 2012, the NESW gallery Common Sense held twenty-nine exhibitions of artists from around the world working in a variety of media.&lt;ref name="BIG2" /&gt; The North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop formerly ran a widely read blog called Studiosavant, which discussed the [[Edmonton]] art scene.&lt;ref name="TI" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://4edges.wordpress.com/2010/01/24/the-north-edmonton-sculpture-workshop/ "The North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop", Four Edges Around, January 24, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/blog.html "Bad Faith No More", Studiosavant, March 18, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://prairieseen.tumblr.com/post/37810563656/profiles-edmonton-art-institutions-arts-writing "Profiles: Edmonton Art Institutions (Arts Writing)," Prairie Seen, December 12, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nuvolo''' (born Giorgio Ascani, October 12, 1926 – October 10, 2008) was an [[list of Italian painters|Italian painter]], pioneer of pictorial techniques applied to [[screen printing]] and [[computer graphics]].

[[File:Nuvolo Cuciti a macchina.jpg|thumb|Nuvolo Cuciti a macchina]]

==Biography and works==

===Early life===
Nuvolo was born on October 12, 1926 in [[Città di Castello]], one of the major centers for typographic industry in Italy. His parents involved him in their printing workshop early in his life.
The nickname “Nuvolo” (cloud) was given to him during the Second World War, when as teenage partisan his peers compared his quick appearances to a sudden cloud in the sky.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Corà, Nuvolo lo spazio pittorico tra caos e ordine, Città di Castello, 2005, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young artisan in the first years after the war, he soon showed manual dexterity in various fields, from decoration to set design, and gradually he focused his attention on silkscreen and its potential uses, working either in his family workshop or at the local graphic arts school, where he found teachers who fostered his disposition toward exploration.&lt;ref&gt;Aldo Iori “Per una serigrafia empatica” in B.Corà Nuvolo la pittura e l’atelier di grafica, Città di Castello, 1992 and B.Corà Nuvolo lo spazio pittorico tra caos e ordine, Città di Castello, 2005, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Rome with Alberto Burri===
In 1949, Nuvolo moved to Rome, at the suggestion of his friend and fellow countryman [[Alberto Burri]]. Nuvolo primarily became Burri's collaborator at his [[Via Margutta]] studio,  matching his work as an advertising artist with a first series of screen printing, the first foray into the field of visual arts.

Although silk screen tools were very poor at the times, he was the first in Italy, to adopt this technique for artistic goals. He created abstract figures by silk screen, utilizing dichromate gel, adopted from the rotogravure printing technique.&lt;ref&gt;Aldo Iori, ibidem&lt;/ref&gt;

If in such graphic experiments he was initially influenced by his friend’s matter research, Nuvolo would soon find his own creative autonomy in this medium as an innovator himself.

===The “informal” climate===
Working as an aid for Burri, Nuvolo got more and more in touch with a group of informal painting artists who characterized that decade. He associated with the (short lived) "Gruppo Origine", founded between 1949 and 1950 and formed by [[Corrado Cagli]], [[Giuseppe Capogrossi]], [[Mario Balocco]], [[Ettore Colla]] and Burri himself, sharing an interest for new materials to connect to painting and a progressive departure from the use of paintbrush.

===The “serotipie”===
Around the middle of the Fifties, the quality of silk screens improved and helped Nuvolo to achieve new results in terms of printing and graphic experimentation: in 1954, “Arti Visive”, innovative art journal (alternitavely directed by Ettore Colla and by poet and Biblicist [[Emilio Villa]] along with his brother Ascanio Ascani), displayed his first official works on its covers and within its pages.&lt;ref&gt;Aldo Tagliaferri, Il clandestino vita e opere di Emilio Villa, Roma, 2004, pp. 95-96&lt;/ref&gt;

The name “Serotipie” was coined by Emilio Villa, who found a new artistic meaning for the silk screen abstract works, not intending them as reproduction series but unique printing works, made by an industrial tool and elaborated by acrylic and other materials.&lt;ref&gt;Aldo Tagliaferri, ibidem&lt;/ref&gt;
Interested on the role of causality in arts, similar to [[Pollock]]’s [[dripping]], and focusing on various fields like physic, astronomy and mathematics, Nuvolo gave a new status to silk screen tool and its artistic potential.&lt;ref&gt;"serotipia is to be intended as painting made by the tool of serigraphy, or silscreen, but inside the limits of the unique specimen, uncopyable” E. Villa exhibition catalogue Mostra di serotipie di Lorri e Nuvolo, Roma, Libreria "Al ferro di cavallo", 1958, page unnumbered&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silk screen paintings and collages===
In 1956 Nuvolo married Liana Baracchi and together they organized an atelier for graphic arts which flourished for more than fifty years, first in Rome and then moving to his native Città di Castello in the Early Eighties.
Silk screen printing became the starting point for a vast array of artistic applications extending into many different fields over the years such as weaving, graphic arts, digital graphics and video art, considered by the author as a private field of research and expression, more than as elements for the marketing of art.
As the critic Bruno Corà wrote, “the Mondrian and Burri lesson found Nuvolo as exponent of principles so able to create an additional zone of poetic sensibility between the Cartesian rigor of the Dutch and the epic and dramatic nature of the Italian”.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Corà Nuvolo lo spazio pittorico tra caos e ordine, Città di Castello, 2005, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sewing machine production===
Applying a small motor to a simple Vigorelli sewing machine, Nuvolo started a new cycle of spatial construction in the early Sixties. Textiles and fabrics led to unexpected geometric solutions “mixing – as the critic [[Gillo Dorfles]] wrote – the precedent experiences of [[Patchwork]] and [[Ready Made]]”&lt;ref&gt;Gillo Dorfles, ''Ultime tendenze nell'arte d'oggi: dall'informale al concettuale'', Milano, 1973, pp. 38-50&lt;/ref&gt; in the series “Tensioni” (Tensions), “Diagrammi” (Diagrams) and “Daini” (Deers).

===New frontiers in serigraphy===
In the decade from 1967 to 1977, the formal conjunctions of the “Oigrog” series,(with the anagrammatic title of the artist's name “Giorgio”), established a new serigraphic series based on the principles of fluid mechanics. The author used nitro colors giving life to psychedelic figures “simultaneously archetypical and android, as a last dynasty of golems produced by arts”.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Corà, ''Nuvolo lo spazio pittorico tra caos e ordine'', Città di Castello, 2005, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;
The “Modulari” of 1969/1971 defined a new dynamic progression in symmetrical secularity of photographs created with silk screen.

===Digital production===
A new formal concept based on vector mathematics was introduced to Nuvolo by the developing of Informatics in the early Eighties, supported by his sons Giorgio, photographer and Paolo, computer technician.&lt;ref&gt;Aldo Iori “Per una serigrafia empatica” in B. Corà ''Nuvolo la pittura e l’atelier di grafica'', Città di Castello, 1992 pp. 313-316 and B. Corà ''Nuvolo lo spazio pittorico tra caos e ordine'', Città di Castello, 2005, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;
In “Alpha 39” (1987/89) series he used binary code, forging a scientific approach which led to the “Aftermandelbrot” series (1989/1992), following the fractal  theories of [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] forcing it through a combination of “guided errors”, deviations to the formula by computer, which created a proliferation of images by colors related to numerical values.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Corà, ''Nuvolo lo spazio pittorico tra caos e ordine'', Città di Castello, 2005, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

This computer graphics production led to the work created in the Nineties with the cycles of “Circuiti” (Circuits), “Dittici e Trittici” (Diptychs and Triptychs),  “Enantiomorfi” (Enantiomorphs), “Omogeni”, till the last “Turbolenze” (Turbulences) of 1998 and “Legni Collage” (Wood collage) of 2002. The various applications of the “Genesi” (Genesis) cycle, started around 1994, which combined a particular manual intervention and a deeply pondered dialogue with video and sound based on the symphonies of [[Bach]].

==Main exhibitions and collaborations==
[[File:Nuvolo New York.jpg|thumb]]
The first personal exhibition by Nuvolo was held in 1955 at the roman Gallery “Le Carrozze”, presented by the poet Emilio Villa. In the same year Corrado Cagli organized the second show in Florence, as the painter began to participate in various collective exhibitions with the coeval innovators of Informal paintings like Cagli himself, Burri, [[Giuseppe Capogrossi]], [[Giulio Turcato]], Mirko, [[Edgardo Mannucci]], [[Carla Accardi]], Achille Perilli and [[Piero Dorazio]]. 
He participated to important festivals such as the [[Rome Quadriennale]] and the Premio Lissone, which led him to the attention of [[Lucio Fontana]] and the innovators in Milan, as well as beginning a lifetime collaboration with [[Ettore Colla]].

Nuvolo's innovative activity was also encouraged by [[Peggy Guggenheim]], who bought some of his works at “La Tartaruga” Gallery in Rome, for both her US and Italian collections. Around 1967 he started a long and important collaboration in the field of graphic arts with many contemporary artists like Corrado Cagli, [[Renato Guttuso]], [[Jannis Kounellis]], [[Michelangelo Pistoletto]] and Alberto Burri, who came back to work with him after many years for the chromatic cycle “Sestante” in the Mid-Eighties.

In 2002 he returned to produce the “esoedizioni” with various authors and critics exposing the works at the XVIII Century typography "Grifani Donati" in his hometown, alongside the collaborator Marco Baldicchi.&lt;ref&gt;Titles of the new editions of “esoedizioni” for the publishing house “I libri di AIEUO”, Città di Castello: B. Corà ''Avviso ai naviganti, Nuvolo, Turbolenze'' (2002), A. Iori, ''Sei lettere e cinque invenzioni di Nuvolo'' (2003), A. Leveque ''Ciò che sente un uomo e cinque invenzioni di Nuvolo'' (2003), V. Nocchi, ''Sulla pensabilità dell’origine. Riflessione in margine a “Genesi” e cinque invenzioni di Nuvolo'' (2003), M. Diacono, C''os’è una poesia e cinque invenzioni di Nuvolo'' (2004), M. Napolitano, ''Due poesie e cinque invenzioni di Nuvolo'' (2004), A. Tagliaferri ''Una materia controversa e cinque invenzioni di Nuvolo'' (2003), M. Baldicchi, ''Appunti di viaggio e cinque invenzioni di Nuvolo'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

To celebrate fifty years of his activity [[Perugia]] and his hometown Città di Castello hosted an articulated exhibition encompassing a complete monographic study of his art by the critic Bruno Corà, “Nuvolo, the painting space between order and chaos”.

In 2017 Di Donna Galleries in New York announced "Nuvolo and Post-War Materiality 1950 – 1965", an exhibition curated by [[Germano Celant]] focusing Nuvolo’s role in "radically redefining traditional notions of painting and sculpture by exploiting the physical properties of raw materials using unmediated processes"&lt;ref&gt;''Nuvolo and Post-War Materiality 1950 – 1965'' exhibition catalogue p. 3 (2017)&lt;/ref&gt; in the "cuciti a macchina", "daini", and "diagrammi" series, contextualized by works by European and American artists as [[Burri]], [[Lucio Fontana]], [[Piero Manzoni]], [[Antoni Tàpies]], [[Cy Twombly]], Ettore Colla, [[Pietro Consagra]], [[Jean Fautrier]], Addie Herder, [[Conrad Marca-Relli]], [[Manolo Millares]], [[Mimmo Rotella]], Angelo Savelli, [[Salvatore Scarpitta]], Toti Scialoja.

==Teaching==
In 1977, after some years of teaching in the schools of arts in and outside Rome he won the Chair of Painting Arts at the Academy of Fine Arts of Perugia, where he became director from 1979 to 1984.
Under his guidance the athenaeum reached a new way in teaching and promoting arts so that many important contemporary artists were invited to and actively collaborated with the institution.&lt;ref&gt;Aldo Iori “Per una serigrafia empatica” in B.Corà ''Nuvolo la pittura e l’atelier di grafica'', Città di Castello, 1992, and B.Corà ''Nuvolo lo spazio pittorico tra caos e ordine'', Città di Castello, 2005, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Nuvolo Archive==
When the artist passed away in his hometown on December 2008, Nuvolo was already entered in the small circle of contemporary arts innovators and today his works are found in the collections of some of the major museums of Italy, France, Israel and United States.

In 2015 the family of the artist founded the “Nuvolo Archive” and donated some of his main works to the [[Pinacoteca Comunale, Città di Castello]], which now sit amongst the rich historic and artistic heritage of the city.

'''Olivier Boissiere''' (Olivier Boissière, born in 1939) is a French writer and commentator of contemporary art and architecture. His profiles, comments, features and interviews have been published in international magazines such as [[Domus (magazine)|Domus]], [[Abitare]], [http://www.larchitecturedaujourdhui.fr/ L'Architecture d'Aujourd'hui] and [[Vogue Paris]]. Boissiere is the author of several books about the works of [[Jean Nouvel]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Le Corbusier]], [[Ron Arad (industrial designer)|Ron Arad]] and [[Philippe Starck]].&lt;ref&gt;archINFORM database [https://eng.archinform.net/arch/4302.htm "Olivier Boissiere, author"]. Retrieved on 03 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He has been on [[Jean Nouvel]]'s team &lt;ref&gt;Hristov, Ivo.

As an assistant and neophyte of art critic [[Pierre Restany]], Boissière witnessed the emerging of the avant-garde in the Sixties with [[Yves Klein]], [[Raymond Hains]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude|Christo]] and others, who held their  exhibitions in Galerie J in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1433397/Pierre-Restany.html "Pierre Restany,"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]], 2003''&lt;/ref&gt; Later his interests shifted to modern European and American architecture. He was close to the early [[Frank Gehry]] and familiar with the Californian art scene in the Seventies, privileged to encounter great artists such as [[Edward Ruscha|Ed Ruscha]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]] and [[Donald Judd]]. A close friend of [[Lewis Baltz]], he still keeps strong bonds with the French art scene as a familiar of [[Sophie Calle]],&lt;ref&gt;SOPHIE CALLE, "Douleur Exquise", Erna Hesse Luxembourg, 2008 [http://www.ernahecey.com/luxembourg/exhibitions_1_details.php Exhibition Rress release]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Charles Blais|Jean Charles Blais]],&lt;ref&gt;Jean Charles Blais, SECHS SONGS D'AMOUR [http://www.uncabinetdamateur.bg/exhibitions/past/item/11-sechs-songs-damour#information "Un Cabinet d'Amateur"], 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Buren]], Bertrand Lavier, [[Olivier Mosset]] and [[Bernard Frize]]. A modest art collector himself, Boissiere gathers his works along some recent discoveries in his Un Cabinet d'Amateur in Sofia, devoted to Bulgarian and foreign contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncabinetdamateur.bg/#information "UN CABINET D'AMATEUR Olivier Boissiere"]&lt;/ref&gt; He currently lives and works in Paris and Sofia.&lt;ref&gt;Веселин Трандов, [http://www.capital.bg/light/lica/2013/06/21/2086950_sugrajdaninut_olivie/ "Съгражданинът Оливие"], в-к Капитал, 21 юни 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1960's. Nouveaux Réalistes, Pop and Minimal art. ==

Boissiere’s introduction to the arts started from Gallerie J in Paris, where he worked as an assistant to Jeanine de Goldschmidt and art critic [[Pierre Restany]]. It was the home of the [[Nouveau réalisme|Nouveaux Réalistes]] - an artistic movement, founded by [[Pierre Restany|Restany]] together with [[Yves Klein]], [[Arman]], [[Raymond Hains]] and others. The gallery did present the first exhibition of [[Cy Twombly]] in Paris, the famous [[Daniel Spoerri]] dinners and the oil barrels of [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude|Christo]] on Rue Visconti. During this period Boissiere witnessed the opening of the first [[Ileana Sonnabend]] gallery in Paris, where American [[Pop art]] artists such as [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] were introduced in Europe for the first time.

== 1970's. Young Americans and Frank Gehry ==

After being a partner in Atelier A, a short lived venture where artists like [[Arman]] and [[Robert Malaval]] designed objects and artefacts, Boissiere was cooped in a small institution under the French ministry of industry to take part in a program promoting French design. He did attend and reported about international design congresses in Moscow, Kyoto, Vancouver, Aspen and Berlin. Soon he was appointed an editor of Architecture Intérieure Cree Magazine, where he introduced the young lions&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Boissiere, Stanley Tigerman: une bilbiothèque pour handicapés, Chicago, Architecture intérieure créé, May–June 1979,171, page 108–112&lt;/ref&gt; challenging the International style who were at that time [[Archigram]], [[Cedric Price]], [[Renzo Piano]], [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]], the Radical architecture in Italy, the American “Post-moderns” after the provoking [[Learning from Las Vegas]], the architectural theories of [[Aldo Rossi]], [[Lucien Kroll]], the works of [[Gordon Matta-Clark|Gordon Matta Clark]].
In the US Olivier Boissière did multiple coast to coast trips, documenting the works of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] or following the steps of art historian [[Aby Warburg]], who had visited the world of the Hopis in Arizona at beginning of the century. At the eve of his journalistic career, he had encounters with [[Zaha Hadid]], still a student of the Architectural Association, [[Tomás Maldonado|Tomas Maldonado]], [[Buckminster Fuller]], [[Philip Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Boissiere, Dynastie (interview with Philip Johnson), L'architecture d'aujourd'hui, September 1987,252, page 8–11&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonas Salk]] and [[Frank Gehry]].&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Boissiere, Ten California Architects, Domus No. 604, March, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Back in Europe he was fortunate to attend the first great exhibitions by curator [[Harald Szeemann]], the Bachelors Machines at UCAD in Paris and [[Documenta|dokumenta]] V in Kassel with works by [[Joseph Beuys|Beuys]], [[Edward Kienholz|Kienholz]] and [[Bruce Nauman]].

== 1980's. Travelling with art and architecture. Lewis Baltz. ==

Spanning his life between Paris, Milan and Los Angeles, Olivier Boissiere became a regular culture and architecture writer for [[Domus (magazine)|Domus]], L'Architecture d'Aujourd'hui, [[Le Monde]] and some [[Condé Nast]] magazines such as [[Vogue Paris|Vogue]], where he collaborated with photographer Donatella Brun. His journalistic travels ranged from accompanying [[Frank Gehry]] to the reception of his [[Gerrit Rietveld|Gerit Rietweld]] Award in Utrecht through meeting [[Luis Barragán]] in Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;[Olivier Boissiere, Habitation de M. Francisco Gilardi, Mexico; architect: Luis Barragán, L'architecture d'aujourd'hui, April 1980,208]&lt;/ref&gt; from paying visits to the buildings of [[Ralph Erskine (architect)|Ralph Erskine]] in Stockholm to doing a series of interviews with [[Rem Koolhaas]] in the Netherlands and photographing the [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]]'s [[HSBC Building (Hong Kong)|HSBC Building]] just opened in Hong Kong. During this period he interviewed [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Coosje van Bruggen]] in New York after meeting them in Utrecht and visited the studio of [[Edward Ruscha|Ed Ruscha]] in Los Angeles. His encounter with great artist and photographer [[Lewis Baltz]] was the beginning of a long friendship, marked by a common interest both in art history and [[The Great Game]]. Boissiere wrote texts for some of Baltz's projects, such as Fos Secteur 80 at [[Tate]], La Ronde de Nuit, shown at [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] and later Piazza Arnolfo in Tuscany.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Rian, Last Interview of Lewis Baltz, L’Oeil de la Photographie, 01 Jan 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Baltz, Notebooks and ephemera 1987 - 2011, The Getty Research Institute, Special Collections&lt;/ref&gt; His first meeting with [[Jean Nouvel]] had happened during this time.

== 1990's. Working with Jean Nouvel. Book publishing. ==
The competition for the [[Kansai International Airport]] in Japan in the late 80's did mark the beginning of an ongoing episodic collaboration with [[Jean Nouvel]], according to projects, competitions and circumstances. Olivier Boissière acted as a researcher, commentator, advisor and publication editor on different projects in real time, which was full-time with Nouvel, the motto of his office being "If you don’t come on Saturday, forget to come back on Sunday!"&lt;ref&gt;Jean Nouvel by Olivier Boissière, Terrail, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In the intervals he worked both as author and director of the architectural collections for two publishing houses in Paris and did extensive trips in Europe and India, doing a close survey on the legacy of [[Le Corbusier]] along with [[Dominique Lyon]] and photographer Anriet Denis.&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Lyon, Olivier Boissiere, Anriet Denis, Le Corbusier Alive, Vilo International, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant ХХ century houses in Europe ranging from the Art Nouveau to the British high tech was the subject for another book.&lt;ref&gt;Twentieth-Century Houses: Europe by Olivier Boissiere, Rizzoli, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; A trip to the South West Arizona and New Mexico provided for meetings with architects [[Antoine Predock]] and Bart Prince . As a guest of [[Donald Judd]], Boissière did a large photo survey of the [[Chinati Foundation]] in Marfa, Texas with major artworks and installations by [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|Chamberlain]], [[Claes Oldenburg|Oldenburg]] and [[Donald Judd]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Boissiere, Judd: sur la route de Marfa, L'architecture d'aujourd'hui, December 1992,284 page 88–97&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2000’s. Between East and West ==
At the beginning of 2000, Boissiere was a coordinator for [[Jean Nouvel]]'s Morat site for the [[Expo.02]] in Switzerland. Along with Federico Mazzoto he also coordinated [[Jean Nouvel|Nouvel]]'s project for Piazza Arnolfo in Colle d'Elsa, featuring artists [[Daniel Buren]], [[Lewis Baltz]], Alessandra Tesi, Bertrand Lavier. 
Following up Nouvel's projects for the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]], directed by [[Thomas Krens]], he visited Baku and The Republic of Azerbaidjan, Rio de Janeiro and [[Oscar Niemeyer]]'s office,  and was granted  private visits of the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]] in Saint Petersburg and the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abitare.it/en/research/2011/12/20/being-jean-nouvel-2/ Being Jean Nouvel], edited by Olivier Boissiere and Maria Giulia Zunino, ABITARE 518/2011&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 1997 Olivier Boissiere has been shifting between Paris and Sofia. Along with Anriet Denis he established Adob Design in Sofia - a showroom, promoting good design, which introduced for the first time in Bulgaria the furniture of the [[Charles and Ray Eames|Eames]], [[Jasper Morrison]], [[Marc Newson]], [[Ron Arad (industrial designer)|Ron Arad]] and [[Frank Gehry]], the lights of [[Achille Castiglioni]] and [[Ingo Maurer]] and organized exhibitions where Gehry, Maurer and Nouvel were presented. For more than 15 years his voice has resonated as a commentator of the creative processes in Bulgaria. His ongoing commitment for sustainable architecture has been guiding a few of the young Bulgarian architects. In 2010 Olivier Boissiere has been the coordinator of the first ABITARE Talks Conference in Sofia “Do we need museums and galleries” with speakers [[Jean Nouvel]], [[Italo Rota]], David Cascaro and Monique Veaute.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Giulia Zunino [http://www.abitare.it/it/archivio/2010/02/26/abitare-talks-2/?refresh_ce-cp "La prima edizione degli Abitare Talks, organizzati da Abitare Bulgaria a Sofia"], abitare.it, 26 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Under his proficient eye in 2011 the first Sofia Architecture Week was organized by One Magazine, where Boissiere introduced French architects like Anne Lacaton, Dominique Lyon, Frédéric Borel and Rudy Ricciotti.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edno.bg/assets/Magazines/edno_broy90_fall2010.pdf "What have we seen so far at Sofia Architecture Week and what are we about to see?"], One Magazine No. 90/2011, page 142&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2012 to present. Un Cabinet d'Amateur.==
Being a modest art collector himself, Olivier Boissière works closely with the emerging talents on the Bulgarian art scene, some of which he presents at his private apartment/gallery in Sofia. Un Cabinet d'Amateur, devoted to Bulgarian and foreign contemporary art, was established in 2012 and has exhibited works  of Kalin Serapionov, [[Svetlana Mircheva]], Marie Maillard, Stela Vassileva, [[Lewis Baltz]], Jean-Charles Blais, [[Sophie Calle]].&lt;ref&gt;Светлана Куюмджиева, [http://www.kultura.bg/bg/print_article/view/22609 "Запознанство със Софи Кал"], в-к Култура, брой 33 (2782), 10 октомври 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Along with artworks, the Cabinet accommodates a small library with Boissere's personal collection of books, catalogs and documents from his longtime journey in the field. In 2015 Boissiere was an advisor to the team of architects Manal Rachdi and [[Sou Fujimoto]] in the "Reinventer Paris" competition. It was a winning entry for a block at Porte Maillot.&lt;ref&gt;Marco Rinaldi, [http://aasarchitecture.com/2016/02/mille-arbres-by-manal-rachdi-oxo-architectes-sou-fujimoto.html "MILLE ARBRES BY MANAL RACHDI OXO ARCHITECTES + SOU FUJIMOTO"], aasarchitecture.com, 04 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
He is currently working on the book about Jean Nouvel's Louvre in Abu Dhabi and a second fiction novel.

This service is a fundamental [[library]] service; however, readers' advisory also occurs in commercial contexts such as bookstores.  Currently, almost all North American public libraries offer some form of readers' advisory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Dilevko |first = Juris |last2 = Magowan |first2 = Candice |title = Readers' Advisory Service in North American Public Libraries, 1870–2005 |place = [[Jefferson, NC]] |page = 3 |publisher = [[McFarland &amp; Company]] |year = 2007 |isbn = 978-0-7864-2925-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===North America===
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Setting a date for the start of what we now call readers advisory service, particularly readers advisory in the public library, is at best a frustrating, almost arbitrary exercise. Efforts at historical precision can founder on such basic issues as the absence of common definitions. For example, answers to such questions as 'What exactly is a public library?" or "What really is readers advisory?" have long been disputed." (Bill Crowley, from his 2005 journal article "Rediscovering the History of Readers Advisory Service")&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Crowley |first = Bill |title = Rediscovering the History of Readers Advisory Service |journal = [[Public library (journal)|Public Libraries]] |volume = 44 |issue = 1 |page = 37 |year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Opposing Viewpoints on the Merits of Different Types of Readers' Advisory====

The historical period divisions and merits of different types of readers' advisory services is a hotly debated topic among librarians.

Bill Crowley, in his 2005 article, "Rediscovering the History of Readers Advisory Service," breaks down the historical period divisions of the service into four eras:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Crowley |first = Bill |title = Rediscovering the History of Readers Advisory Service |journal = Public Libraries |volume = 44 |issue = 1 |page = 38 |year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1876 to 1920 - "Inventing" Readers' Advisory
*1920 to 1940 - "Privileging Nonfiction" in Readers' Advisory
*1940 to 1984 - Readers' Advisory "'Lost' in Adult Services"
*1984 to 2005 (current at time of article) - "Reviving Readers' Advisory"

Juris Dilevko and Candice Magowan question the merits of the current readers' advisory emphasis on popular fiction materials in their book "Readers' Advisory Service in North American Public Libraries, 1870–2005."  They subdivide the history as:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Citation |last = Dilevko |first = Juris |last2 = Magowan |first2 = Candice |title = Readers' Advisory Service in North American Public Libraries, 1870–2005 |place = Jefferson, North Carolina, and London |page = 53 |publisher = McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers |year = 2007 |isbn = 978-0-7864-2925-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1870 to 1916 - "The Formative Years"
*1917 to 1962 - "The Commitment to Systematic Adult Education"
*1963 to 2005 - "The Devolution into Entertainment"

Dilevko and Mogowan write about "readers' advisory systematically committ[ing] itself to meaningful adult education through serious and purposeful reading"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Amazon.com |title = Editorial Reviews: Product Description |url = https://www.amazon.com/Readers-Advisory-Service-Libraries-1870–2005/dp/0786429259 | accessdate = 2008-07-24 |publisher = [[Amazon.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; up until the 1960s, when emphasis on "popular culture resulted in the 'Give 'Em What They Want' approach"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; and "The Devolution into Entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Dilevko |first = Juris |last2 = Magowan |first2 = Candice |title = Readers' Advisory Service in North American Public Libraries, 1870–2005 |place = Jefferson, NC |page = 53 |publisher = [[McFarland &amp; Company]] |year = 2007 |isbn = 978-0-7864-2925-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1897–1920====

In 1897, the ALA President stated that "the personal influence of librarians who assisted and advised readers was the most potent force in molding community reading."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Birge |first = Lynn E. |title = Serving Adult Learners: A Public Library Tradition |publisher = [[American Library Association]] |year = 1981 |place = Chicago |isbn = 0-8389-0346-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1920–1980====

Organized readers' advisory programs have been documented dating back to the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Saricks |first = Joyce |year = 2005 |title = Readers' Advisory service in the Public Library |edition = 3rd |place = [[Chicago]] |publisher = [[American Library Association]] |page = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1922–1926 readers' advisory programs were experimentally introduced into seven urban libraries (Cleveland and Detroit, in 1922,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Citation |editor-last = Wiegand |editor-first = Wayne |editor2-last = Davis |editor2-first = Donald |year = 1994 |title = Encyclopedia of Library History |publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |page = 538 |isbn = 0-8240-5787-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indianapolis, Milwaukee, and Chicago, in 1923 and 1924,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; and Cincinnati and Portland, OR).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Saricks |first = Joyce |year = 2005 |title = Readers' Advisory service in the Public Library |edition = 3rd |place = [[Chicago]] |publisher = [[American Library Association]] |page = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Adult Education Movement emerged in the 1920s in public libraries and was frequently discussed in [[American Library Association]] professional publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roghiemstra.com/rachal.html |title=The American Library Adult Education Movement: The Diffusion of Knowledge and the Democratic Ideal, 1924–1933 |publisher=Distance.syr.edu |date=1928-12-15 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1924 report ''The American Public Library and the Diffusion of Knowledge'' by William Learned to the Carnegie Corporation sought to establish adult education as the focus of the public library, with personalized readers' advisory service to adult readers by "reference experts" who would make up a "community intelligence service."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

The 1926 [[American Library Association]] "book-length" commission report ''Libraries and Adult Education'' placed high importance on readers' advisory services in Adult Education.  Judson T. Jennings provided a summary of the work, observing that the "library's contribution to adult education resolved itself into three major activities:"&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{Citation |last = Crowley |first = Bill |title = Rediscovering the History of Readers Advisory Service |journal = Public Libraries |volume = 44 |issue = 1 |page = 39 |year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
1. An information service regarding local opportunities for adult students.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Service to other agencies engaged in adult education.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Service to individual readers and students.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Jennings |first = Judson |year = 1929 |title = Voluntary Education through the Public Library |place = Chicago |publisher = [[American Library Association]] |page = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This new professional interest during the 1920s spurred the creation of specialized full-time readers' advisory positions in major public libraries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; By 1936, an estiminated, 50 public libraries had established readers' advisory services.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Until the early 1960s, readers' advisory focused on non-fiction materials and continuing adult education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Burgin |first = Robert |publication-date = 2007–2009 |year = 2007 |title = Ten Reasons to Incorporate Nonfiction into Your Readers' Advisory Class |periodical = Readers' Advisor News |publisher = [[Libraries Unlimited]] |url = http://www.readersadvisoronline.com/ranews/sep2007/burgin.html |accessdate = 2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1980s - 2000s====

Some librarians consider the early 1980s to be the beginning of a revival in readers' advisory and praise the inclusion of fiction (including genre fiction: fantasy, mystery, romance, etc.) and write that historically
readers' advisory was biased in favor of nonfiction.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Bill (2005) "Rediscovering the History of Readers Advisory Service." ''Public Libraries''. Vol 44 No. 1. p.40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luyt, Brendan (2001). "Regulating Readers: The Social Origins of the Readers' Advisor in the United States." ''The Library Quarterly''. Vol. 71 No. 4 p.443-466&lt;/ref&gt;

Others disapprove of the new approaches and changes in service.  Dilevko and Magowan write "Post-1980 readers' advisory thus became an opportunity to converse with patrons about 'light, quick, escapist' books -- popular and ephemeral fiction and nonfiction for entertainment, pleasure, and recreation -- because such conversations were not 'too burdensome'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Dilevko |first = Juris |last2 = Magowan |first2 = Candice |title = Readers' Advisory Service in North American Public Libraries, 1870–2005 |place = Jefferson, NC |page = 24 |publisher = [[McFarland &amp; Company]] |year = 2007 |isbn = 978-0-7864-2925-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the term "[[genreflecting]]" was first coined by Betty Rosenberg, who authored: Genreflecting: A Guide to Reading Interests in Genre Fiction (Libraries Unlimited, 1982).

Another major influence on the spread and revival of readers' advisory was the Adult Reading Round Table (ARRT),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arrtreads.org/ |title=Adult Reading Round Table Homepage |publisher=ARRT Reads |date= |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded by a group of Chicago public librarians in 1984.  The group organized workshops, seminars, and genre-study groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Dilevko |first = Juris |last2 = Magowan |first2 = Candice |title = Readers' Advisory Service in North American Public Libraries, 1870–2005 |place = Jefferson, NC |page = 3 |publisher = McFarland &amp; Company |year = 2007 |isbn = 978-0-7864-2925-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A list of past programs offered by ARRT, dating back to its founding in 1984, is available at http://www.arrtreads.org/pastprograms.html (accessed March 10, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Current Interest====
Interest in readers' advisory continues to grow. [[Libraries Unlimited]] [[Genreflecting]] Advisory Series has grown to 27 titles as of July 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bopp |first=Richard E. |url=http://lu.com/showseries.cfm?serid=10 |title=Imprint |publisher=[[Libraries Unlimited]] - Lu.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from 15 titles in 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Dilevko |first = Juris |last2 = Magowan |first2 = Candice |title = Readers' Advisory Service in North American Public Libraries, 1870–2005 |place = Jefferson, NC |page = 4 |publisher = [[McFarland &amp; Company]] |year = 2007 |isbn = 978-0-7864-2925-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beyond traditional genres (fantasy, mystery, romance), some of the diverse offerings now include guides to [[LGBT]] literature,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lu.com/showbook.cfm?isbn=9781591581949 ABC-CLIO - Product - Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgendered Literature: A Genre Guide - Ellen Bosman, John P. Bradford and Robert B. Ridinger&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; guides to [[graphic novels]] ([[comic books]], [[manga]], etc),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lu.com/showbook.cfm?isbn=9781591581321 |title=ABC-CLIO - Product - Graphic Novels: A Genre Guide to Comic Books, Manga, and More - Michael Pawuk |publisher=Lu.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Christian fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;http://lu.com/showbook.cfm?isbn=9781563088711&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;". . . contemporary readers advisory service is best understood as an organized program promoting both fiction and nonfiction discretionary reading for the dual purposes of satisfying reader needs and advancing a culture's goal of a literate population." (Bill Crowley, from his 2005 journal article "Rediscovering the History of Readers Advisory Service")&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Crowley |first = Bill |title = Rediscovering the History of Readers Advisory Service |journal = Public Libraries |volume = 44 |issue = 1 |page = 37 |year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Types==

===Direct readers' advisory===
Direct readers' advisory is based on a non-judgmental assessment of the personal preferences of the reader through a series of questions, called a readers advisory conversation.  The assessment focuses on reader likes and dislikes with regard to a number of factors, including subject, reading level, genre, writing style, the level of characterization, plot elements, storyline, pace, tone, frame, and setting.  The hoped-for outcome of this interview is the identification of three or more appropriate suggestions (sometimes referred to as "readalikes"—especially when the interview was initiated by patron interest in new authors/titles similar to one enjoyed in the past).  In identifying suitable suggestions, a readers' advisor combines personal knowledge of material with a variety of specialized print and online resources to come up with appropriate suggestions. The goal of direct readers advisory is to ''suggest'' titles based on a readers' individual interests and tastes.  Librarians who simply recommend their favorite books with little or no regard for the patron's own interests are not performing readers' advisory.

For example, if a patron requests "a good book," the readers' advisor might ask the reader to describe a book they have enjoyed.  The focus of the conversation is not on recitation of plot, but on the aforementioned appeal elements (i.e. pace, subject, tone, writing style, etc.).  In our example, the patron tells the readers' advisor of a humorous [[mystery novel]] with a sharp-tongued female protagonist.  Our readers' advisor also learns that the patron prefers fast-paced dialogue to excessive descriptive passages.  Once the appeal elements have been identified (i.e. a humorous mystery featuring snappy dialogue and a female protagonist), the readers' advisor will suggest appropriate titles in the collection by drawing on personal knowledge and/or by consulting appropriate print and online resources.  Even though the patron requested a mystery, a skilled readers advisor will often offer a suggestion or two that point the reader to new a new vista outside of a mentioned genre or milieu.

Readers' advisory can also be performed across multiple media.  For example, a patron who likes the movie [[Matilda (1996 film)|''Matilda'']] might be unaware that it is based on a book by [[Roald Dahl]].  Other patrons who enjoy audio books may be introduced to other titles read by the same person.

====Questions to consider asking in the readers' advisory interview====

In the 2005 edition of ''Readers' Advisory Services in the Public Library'', [[Joyce Saricks]] lists some questions for advisors to consider, such as:

*Are characters and plot quickly revealed or slowly unveiled? (Identifying Pacing)
*Is there more dialogue or more description? (Identifying Pacing)
*Is there a focus on a single character or on several whose lives are intertwined (Identify Characterization)
*Is the focus of the story more interior and psychological or exterior and action oriented? (Identifying Story Line)

===Indirect readers' advisory===
[[File:Indirect readers advisory.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Indirect readers' advisory display: "Looking for a good book? . . . You could ask one of our Fabulous Librarians . . . or try some of these ''nifty reading guides''"]]
Indirect readers' advisory involves the creation of displays, bookmarks, and [[Annotated bibliography|annotated book lists]] that a reader/patron can pick up and peruse on their own without actively engaging a readers' advisor.  Indirect readers' advisory aids, particularly annotated book lists, focus on appeal elements rather than providing extensive plot summaries.  Recently, some public libraries (like the [http://www.wrl.org/bookweb/RA/ Williamsburg Regional Library] in Virginia) have begun experimenting with form-based readers' advisory, which allows for a richer indirect readers advisory experience.

Maintaining a Staff Recommendations display is another way to improve a library's readers' advisory service. Since many readers are browsers, staff recommendations make it easier to select a book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Nottingham |first = Julie |title = Doing It Right: A Reader's Advisory Program |periodical = Reference and User Services Quarterly |volume = 41 |issue = 4 |page = 338}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{Citation |url = http://liswiki.org/wiki/Readers'_advisory |title=Readers' advisory |publisher=LISWiki |accessdate = 2008-07-24}} (Content is available under GNU Free Documentation License 1.2)&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 2001 article "Reader's Advisory: Matching Mood and Material," Ross and Chelton recommend placing books in four areas of the library in order to make the most of merchandising. These four areas are the entrance, the ends of stacks, high traffic areas, and the circulation desk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Ross |first = C. S. |last2 = Chelton |first2 = M. K. |title = Reader's advisory: Matching mood and material |periodical = Library Journal |volume = 126 |issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placing the display in these areas ensure that patrons will see and, hopefully, utilize the books on display. Ross and Chelton also note that books, not posters and announcements, should be here because merchandised titles will circulate very quickly.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

==Discussion of Readers' Advisory Resources==

There are numerous books, online subscription databases, and websites dedicated to readers' advisory.

===Australia and New Zealand===

* Libraries Alive provide a guide to [http://www.librariesalive.com.au/RA_sites.htm readers' advisory resources] for Australian and New Zealand readers and authors.
*[http://www.betterreading.com.au/ Better Reading] is a website that aims to be a great source of independent book recommendations for Australian readers and their families. The site focusses on sharing great stories, and helping people discover new books and authors.

===Print Resources===

Popular print resources include the ''[[What Do I Read Next?]]'' series of reference books (published by [[Thomson Gale]]), the ''[[Genreflecting]]'' series (published by [[Libraries Unlimited]]), and the ''Readers' Advisory Guides'' (published by the [[American Library Association]]). 
Seattle Librarian [[Nancy Pearl]] achieved broad fame and recognition for her readers guides, ''[[Book Lust]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52092008 |title=Book lust : recommended reading for every mood, moment, and reason |publisher=Worldcat.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[More Book Lust]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57626438 |title=More book lust : recommended reading for every mood, moment, and reason |publisher=Worldcat.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which recommend "reading for every mood, moment, and reason."  Both have been popular with the general public and can be found at most book stores and libraries.  Also of note are Pearl's guides to contemporary fiction: ''[[Now Read This: A Guide to Mainstream Fiction, 1978–1998]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44960713 |title=Now read this a guide to mainstream fiction, 1978–1998 |publisher=Worldcat.org |date=2008-04-25 |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Now Read This II: A Guide to Mainstream Fiction, 1990–2001]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52980935 |title=Now read this II : a guide to mainstream fiction, 1990–2001 |publisher=Worldcat.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Some libraries have developed online indirect readers' advisory websites based on specific titles, series, or authors.  For example, the Allen County Public Library's ''Lemony Snicket Read-Alikes and Supplements'' page answers the question of 'what to read next' with [[Annotated bibliography|annotated book lists]] based around different genre and stylistic aspects of the series (mystery books,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acpl.lib.in.us/children/snicket.html#mysteries |title=Lemony Snicket Read-Alikes and Supplements |publisher=Acpl.lib.in.us |date= |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; books about "Orphans or kids living without much help from adults,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acpl.lib.in.us/children/snicket.html#orphans |title=Lemony Snicket Read-Alikes and Supplements |publisher=Acpl.lib.in.us |date= |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; humorous books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acpl.lib.in.us/children/snicket.html#funny |title=Lemony Snicket Read-Alikes and Supplements |publisher=Acpl.lib.in.us |date= |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  They also refer readers to non-fiction works on related topics from the ''Lemony Snicket'' series.  For example, the book ''Using Ropes and Knots'' is recommended because

Violet Baudelaire found herself in the unfortunate circumstance of trying to rescue her baby sister Sunny from a perilous perch.

[[File:San Pedro de Larrede.jpg|thumb|The church of [[San Pedro de Lárrede]] is an example of ''Repoblación'' architecture closely linked to Asturian architecture and distinct from Mozarabic.&lt;ref name=Rutas/&gt;]]
The designation ''arte'' (or ''arquitectura'') ''de'' (''la'') ''repoblación'' (literally, "art or architecture of [the] repopulation") was first proposed by [[:es:José Camón Aznar|José Camón Aznar]] in 1949&lt;ref&gt;Although presented in a conference in 1949, it was not published and widely read until 1963. Cf. Utrero Agudo (2006), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; to replace the term [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic]] as applied to certain works of [[architecture]] from the Christian kingdoms of northern Spain between the end of the 9th and beginning of the 11th centuries. Camón argued that these buildings were related stylistically to the [[Asturian architecture|architecture of Asturias]] and owed little to [[Moorish architecture|Andalusian styles]]. Moreover, since they were built by Christians living under Christian rule, neither were they Mozarabic (the [[Mozarabs]] being the Christians of Muslim Spain).&lt;ref name=Rutas&gt;Canellas López and San Vicente (1996), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spanish historiography, the ''[[repoblación]]'' is the expansion of Christian settlement in the [[Duero]] basin and the [[Meseta Central]] in the 9th–10th centuries.

==History==
The religious influences were inevitable given the presence of the  Islamic state of the [[Caliph of Córdoba]], which was highly developed culturally, artistically and economically. However, it had long been suggested that the monumental buildings in northern Spain from this period were crafted by the modest groups of Mozarabic immigrants that settled in the areas of repopulation when the living conditions in Muslim [[al-Andalus]] became difficult to bear. As stated by professor Isidro Bango Torviso, suggesting that these immigrants were responsible for these buildings would be akin to suggesting that:
{{quote|when the Duero River Valley was repopulated under the auspices of the Asturian-[[Kingdom of León|Leonese]] kingdom, northerners settlers would have forsaken all their knowledge and experience and submitted themselves to the 'very rich and demonstrated creative capacity' of poor, rural southern immigrants.}}

The Art and Architecture of the Repoblación is identified as the third subset of the ''Hispanic'' [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque]] period, by the phases that correspond to the [[Visigothic art and architecture|Visigothic art]] and [[Asturian architecture|Asturian art]]. Its architecture is a summary of elements of diverse extraction, irregularly distributed, in such a way that on occasion elements of paleo-Christian, Visigothic or Asturian origin come to predominate, while at other times Muslim characteristics come to the fore.

==Characteristics==
{{list to prose|date=January 2018}}
Some of the identifying characteristics of this Repoblación ecclesiastic architectural style are:
* Basilica or centralized plan; sometimes with opposing [[apse]]s.
* Main chapel on a rectangular plan on the exterior and ultra-semicircular in the interior.
* Use of the [[horseshoe arch]] of Muslim derivation, somewhat more closed and sloped than the Visigothic.
* Generalized use of the horseshoe arch doorway or ''alfiz''.
* Use of the twin and triple windows of Asturian tradition.
* Roofs composed of segmented [[vault (architecture)|vaults]], including traditional [[barrel vault]]s.
* Grouped [[column]]s forming composite pillars, with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian capitals]] decorated with stylized elements and cinctures joining the capital to the columns.
* Walls re-enforced by exterior buttresses.
* Evolution of rafter ornaments to great lobed offsets that support very pronounced eaves.
* Decoration similar to the Visigothic based on volutes, [[swastika]]s, and vegetable and animal themes forming projecting borders.
* A great command of the technique in construction, employing principally ashlar by ''[[bond (masonry)|length and width]]''.
* Absence or sobriety of exterior decoration.
* Diversity in the floor plans, with small proportions and discontinuous spaces covered by [[cupolas]] (groined, segmented, ribbed of horseshoe transept, etc.).

==Examples==

'''Shadow play''', also known as '''shadow puppetry''', is an ancient form of [[storytelling]] and [[entertainment]] which uses flat articulated cut-out figures (shadow puppets) which are held between a source of light and a translucent screen or [[scrim (material)|scrim]]. The cut-out shapes of the puppets sometimes include translucent color or other types of detailing. Various effects can be achieved by moving both the puppets and the light source. A talented [[puppeteer]] can make the figures appear to walk, dance, fight, nod and laugh.

Shadow play is popular in various cultures, among both children and adults in many countries around the world. More than 20 countries are known to have shadow show troupes. Shadow play is an old tradition and it has a long history in Southeast Asia, especially in [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]] and [[Cambodia]]. It has been an ancient art and a living folk tradition in [[China]], [[India]] and [[Nepal]]. It is also known in [[Egypt]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], [[Germany]], [[France]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=orr69/&gt;&lt;ref name=bosnes302&gt;{{cite book|author=Beth Osnes|title=Acting: An International Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTkCI62oXjEC&amp;pg=PA335 |year=2001| publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn= 978-0-87436-795-9|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beth Osnes|title=The Shadow Puppet Theatre of Malaysia: A Study of Wayang Kulit with Performance Scripts and Puppet Designs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ykQlV616gX4C |year=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5792-2|pages=61–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Shadow play probably developed from "par" shows with narrative scenes painted on a large cloth and the story further related through song. As the shows were mostly performed at night the par was illuminated with an oil lamp. Shadow puppet theatre likely originated in Central Asia-China or in India in the 1st millennium BCE.&lt;ref name=chen25&gt;Fan Pen Chen (2003), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1179080 Shadow Theaters of the World], Asian Folklore Studies, Vol. 62, No. 1 (2003), pp. 25-64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=orr69&gt;{{cite journal | last=Orr | first=Inge C. | title=Puppet Theatre in Asia | journal=Asian Folklore Studies | publisher=Nanzan University | volume=33 | issue=1 | year=1974 | doi=10.2307/1177504 | pages=69–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; By at least around 200 BCE the figures on cloth seem to have been replaced with puppetry in Indian "tholu bomalatta" shows. These are performed behind a thin screen with flat, jointed puppets made of colorfully painted transparent leather. The puppets are held close to the screen and lit from behind, while hands and arms are manipulated with attached canes and lower legs swinging freely from the knee.
&lt;ref name=Rawling1999&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pages.citenet.net/users/ctmw2400/chapter2.html|title=Observations on the historical development of puppetry|last=Rawlings|first=Keith|year=1999,2003,2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence of shadow puppet theatre is found in both ancient Chinese and Indian texts. The most significant historical centers of shadow play theatre have been China, Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref name=orr69/&gt;&lt;ref name=bosnes302/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Banham|title=The Cambridge Paperback Guide to Theatre |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ubr35UeE-UQC |year=1996| publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-44654-9|pages=434, 526–531, 906, 1114–1115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Martin Banham, there is little mention of indigenous theatrical activity in the Middle East between the 3rd century CE and the 13th-century, including the centuries that followed the Islamic conquest of the region.&lt;ref name="Banham1996p241"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Banham|title=The Cambridge Paperback Guide to Theatre |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ubr35UeE-UQC&amp;pg=PA241|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-44654-9|pages=241–242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shadow puppet play, states Banham, probably came into vogue in the Middle East after the Mongol invasions and thereafter it incorporated local innovations by the 16th-century. Little mention of shadow play is found in Islamic literature of Iran, but much is found in Turkish and 19th-century Ottoman Empire influenced territories.&lt;ref name="Banham1996p241"/&gt;

While shadow play theatre is an Asian invention, hand puppets have a long history in Europe.&lt;ref name="Banham1996p887"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Banham|title=The Cambridge Paperback Guide to Theatre |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ubr35UeE-UQC |year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-44654-9|pages=887–888}}&lt;/ref&gt; As European merchant ships sailed in the search of sea routes to India and China, they helped diffuse popular entertainment arts and cultural practices into Europe. Shadow theatre became popular in France, Italy, Britain and Germany by the 17th-century.&lt;ref name=kuhn371/&gt;&lt;ref name=boehn352/&gt; In France, shadow play was advertised as ''Ombres Chinoises'', while elsewhere they were called "Magic Lantern".&lt;ref name=kuhn371&gt;{{cite book|author1=Annette Kuhn|author2=Guy Westwell|title=A Dictionary of Film Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZxcVXI-AwkUC&amp;pg=PA371 |year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-958726-4|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Goethe]] helped build a shadow play theatre in Tiefurt in 1781.&lt;ref name=boehn352&gt;{{cite book|author=Max von Boehn|title=A Photographic Guide to the History of the Shadow Puppet Theatre in the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WH58CgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher= Read|isbn= 978-1-4474-8098-3|pages= 352–355}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Evelyn K.

===Prelude to cinematography===
According to Stephen Herbert, the popular shadow theatre evolved nonlinearly into projected slides and ultimately into [[cinematography]]. The common principle in these innovations were the creative use of light, images and a projection screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Herbert|title=A History of Pre-cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pwg_dav1IpcC|year=2000|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-21148-2|pages=iv–ix, Introduction chapter}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Olive Cook, there are many parallels in the development of shadow play and modern cinema, such as their use of music, voice, attempts to introduce colors and mass popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Olive Cook (1963), [https://archive.org/details/movementintwodim00cook Movement in Two Dimensions], Hutchinson, pages 47-58&lt;/ref&gt;

To return to south India, tales are told and songs sung throughout the region, but the same is not true for long narrative singing (epic and the like), or for dance, or for drama; even masks, so widespread in Kerala and other parts of south India, are not significant in Tamil culture."&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th-century and early parts of the 20th-century of the colonial era, Indologists believed that shadow puppet plays had become extinct in India, though mentioned in its ancient Sanskrit texts.&lt;ref name="ClausDiamond2003p544"/&gt; In the 1930s and thereafter, states Stuart Blackburn, these fears of its extinction were found to be false as evidence emerged that shadow puppetry had remained a vigorous rural tradition in central Kerala mountains, most of Karnataka, northern Andhra Pradesh, parts of Tamil Nadu, Odisha and southern Maharashtra.&lt;ref name="ClausDiamond2003p544"/&gt; The Marathi people, particularly of low caste, had preserved and vigorously performed the legends of Hindu epics as a folk tradition. The importance of Marathi artists is evidenced, states Blackburn, from the puppeteers speaking Marathi as their mother tongue, in many non-Marathi speaking states of India.&lt;ref name="ClausDiamond2003p544"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stuart Blackburn |editor=Peter J.

According to Beth Osnes, the ''Tholu Bommalata'' shadow puppet theatre dates back to 3rd-century BCE, and has attracted patronage ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beth Osnes|title=Acting: An International Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTkCI62oXjEC&amp;pg=PA335 |year=2001| publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn= 978-0-87436-795-9|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; The puppets used in a ''Tholu Bommalata'' performance, states Phyllis Dircks, are "translucent, lusciously multicolored leather figures four to five feet tall, and feature one or two articulated arms".&lt;ref name="Dircks2004p110"&gt;{{cite book|author=Phyllis T. Dircks|title=American Puppetry: Collections, History and Performance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VVQd4UD7k40C&amp;pg=PA110 |year=2004|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-1896-1|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of making the puppets is an elaborate ritual, where the artist families in India pray, go into seclusion, produce the craved and incised art work, then celebrate the "metaphorical birth of a puppet" with flowers and incense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Bell|title=Puppets, Masks, and Performing Objects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DUrt2TWsHNIC |year=1999|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-52293-9|pages=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Tholu Pava Koothu'' performance of Kerala uses leather puppets whose images are projected on backlit screen. The shadows are used to creatively express characters and stories in the ''[[Ramayana]]''. A complete performance of the epic can take forty one nights, while an abridged performance lasts as few as seven days.&lt;ref name="Osnes2001p335"&gt;{{cite book|author=Beth Osnes|title=Acting: An International Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTkCI62oXjEC&amp;pg=PA335 |year=2001| publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn= 978-0-87436-795-9|pages=335–336}}&lt;/ref&gt; One feature of the ''Tholu Pava Koothu'' show is that it is a team performance of puppeteers, while other shadow plays such as ''Wayang'' of Indonesia is performed by a single puppeteer for the same ''Ramayana'' story.&lt;ref name="Osnes2001p335"/&gt; There are regional differences within India in the puppet arts. For example, women play a major role in shadow play theatre in most parts of India, except in Kerala and Maharashtra.&lt;ref name="ClausDiamond2003p544"/&gt; Almost everywhere, except Odisha, the puppets are made from tanned deer skin, painted and articulated. Translucent leather puppets are typical in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, while opaque are typical in Kerala and Odisha. The artist troupes typically carry over a hundred puppets for their performance in rural India.&lt;ref name="ClausDiamond2003p544"/&gt;

''[[Wayang kulit]]'', a style of Wayang shadow play, is particularly popular in [[Java]] and [[Bali]]. The term derived from the word ''wayang'' literally means ''shadow'' or imagination in [[Javanese language|Javanese]], also connotes "spirit". The word ''kulit'' means skin, as the material from which the puppet is made is thin perforated leather sheets made from buffalo skin.

The performances of shadow puppet theater in Bali is typically at night, lasting until dawn.&lt;ref name=britwayang/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rubin2001p184"/&gt; The complete ''wayang kulit'' troupes include ''dalang'' (puppet master), ''nayaga'' ([[gamelan]] players), and ''sinden'' (female choral singer). Some of the ''nayaga'' also performed as male choral singer. The ''dalang'' (puppet master) play/ed the wayang behind the cotton screen illuminated by oil lamp or modern halogen lamp, creating visual effects similar to animation. The flat puppet has moveable joints that are animated by hand, using rods connected to the puppet. The handle of the rod is made of carved buffalo horn. On November 7, 2003, [[UNESCO]] designated ''wayang kulit'' from Indonesia as one of the ''[[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]''.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|title="Wayang puppet theatre", Inscribed in 2008 (3.COM) on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity (originally proclaimed in 2003) |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00063 |publisher= UNESCO |accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is performed during sacred temple ceremonies, at private functions, and for the public in the villages.

Cambodian shadow puppet are made of cow hide, and their size are usually quite large depicting a whole scene, the character including its background. Unlike its Javanese counterpart, Cambodian shadow puppets are usually not articulated which rendered the figure's hands unmovable, and also left uncolored which retains its original leather color.

The Cambodian shadow puppet is one of the cultural performances being staged for tourist next to [[Dance in Cambodia|Cambodian traditional dances]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Shadow theatre in [[Thailand]] is called ''[[Nang yai]]''; in the south there is a tradition called ''[[Nang Talung]]''. Nang Yai puppets are normally made of [[cowhide]] and [[rattan]]. Performances are normally accompanied by a combination of [[song]]s and [[chant]]s. Performances in Thailand were temporarily suspended in 1960 due to a fire at the national theatre. Nang drama has influenced modern [[Cinema of Thailand|Thai cinema]], including filmmakers like [[Cherd Songsri]] and [[Payut Ngaokrachang]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mahidol.ac.th/thailand/shadow.html Nang Yai] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021225005656/http://www.mahidol.ac.th/thailand/shadow.html |date=2002-12-25 }} from [[Mahidol University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Malaysia]], shadow puppet plays are also known as ''[[wayang kulit]]''. In both [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Malay language|Malay]], ''Wayang'' means shadow or imagination, while ''Kulit'' means skin and refers to the leather that puppets are made from. Stories presented are usually [[mythology|mythical]] and morality tales. There is an educational moral to the plays which usually portray a battle between Malay shadow plays are sometimes considered one of the earliest examples of [[animation]]. The wayang kulit in northern states of Malaysia such as [[Kelantan]] is influenced and similar to Thai shadow puppets, while the wayang kulit in southern Malay peninsula, especially in [[Johor]] is brought from [[Javanese culture|Javanese]] [[Indonesian culture|Indonesian]] wayang kulit with slightly different on the story and performance.

The puppets are made primarily of [[leather]] and manipulated with sticks or [[domestic buffalo|buffalo]] horn handles. Shadows are cast using an [[oil lamp]] or, in modern times, a halogen light, onto a [[cotton]] cloth background. They are often associated with [[gamelan]] music.

==Chinese==
===Chinese Mainland===
[[File:The Childrens Museum of Indianapolis - Han shadow puppet.jpg|thumb|alt=|This Chinese shadow puppet is illustrative of the ornate detail that goes into the figures. In the collection of [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]].]]
There are several myths and legends about the origins of shadow puppetry in China. The most famous one has it that Chinese shadow puppetry originated when the favorite [[concubine]] of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (156 BCE – 87 BCE) died and magician Shao-weng promised to raise her spirit. The emperor could see a shadow that looked like her move behind the curtains that the magician had placed around some lit torches. It is often told that the magician used a shadow puppet, but the original text in ''[[Book of Han]]'' gives no reason to believe in a relation to shadow puppetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZu9Cje8TfkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=shadow%20theatre%20history&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Chinese Shadow Theatre: History, Popular Religion, and Women Warriors|author=Fan Pen Li Chen|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are many earlier records of all kinds of puppetry in China, clear mention of Chinese shadow play does not occur until the [[Northern Song]] dynasty (960–1127). A 1235 book mentions that the puppets were initially cut out of paper, but later made of colored leather or parchment. The stories were mostly based on history and half fact half fiction, but comedies were also performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dolby |first1=William |title=The Origins of Chinese Puppetry |journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London |date=1978 |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=97–120 |jstor=615625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shadow theatre became quite popular as early as the [[Song Dynasty]] when holidays were marked by the presentation of many shadow plays. During the [[Ming Dynasty]] there were 40 to 50 shadow show [[wiktionary:troupe|troupe]]s in the city of [[Beijing]] alone.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The earliest shadow theatre screens were made of [[Rice paper|mulberry paper]]. The storytellers generally used the art to tell events between various war kingdoms or stories of [[Buddhist]] sources.&lt;ref name="Ewart"&gt;Ewart, Franzeska G. [1998] (1998). Let the Shadows speak: developing children's language through shadow puppetry. {{ISBN|1-85856-099-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, puppets made of [[leather]] and moved on sticks are used to tell dramatic versions of traditional fairy tales and myths. In [[Gansu]] province, it is accompanied by [[Music of Gansu|Daoqing]] music, while in [[Jilin]], accompanying [[Music of Jilin|Huanglong]] music forms some of the basis of modern opera.&lt;ref name="Cvista"&gt;Chinavista. "[http://www.chinavista.com/experience/piying/piying.html Chinavista.com]." ''The Shadow show.'' Retrieved on 2007-05-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese shadow puppetry is shown in the 1994 [[Zhang Yimou]] film ''[[To Live (1994 film)|To Live]]''.

===Taiwan Ping===
The origins of [[Taiwan]]'s shadow puppetry can be traced to the [[Chaozhou|Chaochow]] school of shadow puppet theatre. Commonly known as leather monkey shows or leather shows, the shadow plays were popular in [[Tainan City|Tainan]], [[Kaohsiung]], and [[Pingtung City|Pingtung]] as early as the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644-1911 A.D.). Older puppeteers estimate that there were at least a hundred shadow puppet troupes in southern Taiwan in the closing years of the Qing. Traditionally, the eight to 12-inch puppet figures, and the stage scenery and props such as furniture, natural scenery, pagodas, halls, and plants are all cut from leather. As shadow puppetry is based on light penetrating through a translucent sheet of cloth, the "shadows" are actually silhouettes seen by the audience in profile or face on. Taiwan's shadow plays are accompanied by Chaochow melodies which are often called "priest's melodies" owing to their similarity with the music used by Taoist priests at funerals. A large repertoire of some 300 scripts of the southern school of drama used in shadow puppetry and dating back to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries has been preserved in Taiwan and is considered to be a priceless cultural asset.

===Terminology===
A number of terms are used to describe the different forms.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

* 皮影戏, píyĭngxì is a shadow theatre using leather puppets. The figures are usually moved behind a thin screen and is not entirely a show of shadows as it is more of a silhouette shadow. This gives the figures some color, and is not 100% black and white.
* 纸影戏, zhĭyĭngxì is paper shadow theatre.
* 中国影戏, Zhōngguó yĭngxì is Chinese shadow theatre.

==Ottoman Empire==
[[File:Karagoz figures.jpg|thumb|Shadow play Karagöz puppets from Turkey]]
A more bawdy comedy tradition of shadow play was widespread throughout the [[Ottoman Empire]], possibly since the late 14th century. It was centered around the contrasting interaction between the figures [[Karagöz and Hacivat]]: an unprincipled peasant and his fussy, educated companion. Together with other characters they represented all the major ethnic and social groups in Ottoman culture.&lt;ref&gt;Emin Şenyer: [http://www.karagoz.net/english/shadowplay.htm Karagoz Traditional Turkish Shadow Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Schneider | first= Irene |pages= 193 | chapter= Ebussuud |editor= Michael Stolleis (ed.) |title= Juristen: ein biographisches Lexikon; von der Antike bis zum 20. Jahrhundert |edition= 2nd |year= 2001 |publisher= Beck |location= München |language= German |isbn= 3-406-45957-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was usually performed by a single puppet master, who voiced up to dozens of characters, and could be assisted by an apprentice handing him the puppets. The show could be introduced by a singer, accompanied by a tambourine player.&lt;ref name=Alok/&gt; Its origins are obscure, though probably deriving from an Asian source.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Karagöz theatre puppets have jointed limbs and are made from camel or buffalo hide. The hide is made transparent and colored, resulting in colorful projections. Puppets are typically 35–40 centimeters in height.&lt;ref name=Alok&gt;Ersin Alok, "Karagöz-Hacivat: The Turkish Shadow Play", ''Skylife - Şubat'' ([[Turkish Airlines]] inflight magazine), February 1996, p. 66–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century these characters were adapted to the Greek language and culture, ''Karagöz and Hacivat'' becoming [[Karagiozis]] and [[Hadjiavatis]] with each of the characters assuming stereotypically Greek personalities. This tradition thrived throughout [[Greece]] after independence as popular entertainment for a largely adult audience, particularly before competition arose from television. The stories did, however, retain the period setting in the late years of the Ottoman Empire. Karagiozis theatre has undergone some revival in recent years, with the intended audience tending to be largely juvenile.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Karagöz theatre was also adapted in Egypt and North Africa.&lt;ref name=light&amp;movement1&gt;David Robinson in ''Light and Movement", Chapter 1, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==
Via Italy the shadow theatre spread throughout Europe at the end of the 17th century. It is known that several Italian showmen performed in Germany, France and England during this period.&lt;ref name=light&amp;movement1/&gt;
In 1675 German polymath and philosopher [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] imagined a kind of world exhibition that would show all kinds of new inventions and spectacles. In a handwritten document he supposed it should include shadow theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|url=https://www.academia.edu/379115/Leibniz_and_the_Lantern|title=Leibniz and the Lantern|first=Deac|last=Rossell|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication |url=https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Dr%C3%B4le_de_Pens%C3%A9e,_touchant_une_nouvelle_sorte_de_repr%C3%A9sentations|year=1675|title=Drôle de Pensée, touchant une nouvelle sorte de représentations|author1=Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz |accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French missionaries had taken the shadow show from China to [[France]] in 1767 and put on performances in [[Paris]] and [[Marseilles]], causing quite a stir.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} In time, the ''Ombres chinoises'' ([[French language|French]] for "Chinese Shadows") with local modification and embellishment, became the ''Ombres françaises'' and struck root in the country.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The popularity of Ombres chinoises reflected the [[chinoiserie]] fashion of the days.&lt;ref name=light&amp;movement1/&gt;

French showman [[François Dominique Séraphin]] first presented his shadow spectacle in a [[hôtel particulier]] in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] in 1771. He would go on to perform at the [[Palace of Versailles]] in front of royalty. In 1784 Séraphin moved to Paris, performing his shows at his permanent theatre in the newly opened [[Palais-Royal]] from 8 September 1784. The performances would adapt to the political changes and survived the [[French Revolution]]. Séraphin developed the use of [[clockwork]] mechanisms to automate the show. His nephew took over the show after Séraphin's death in 1800 and it was continued by his heirs until the theatre closed in 1870.&lt;ref name=light&amp;movement1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Altick"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Shows of London|first=Richard Daniel|last=Altick|date=January 1978|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674807310}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pupazzi"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/lespupazzinoirso00lemeuoft/lespupazzinoirso00lemeuoft_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Les pupazzi noirs"|accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stafford"&gt;{{cite book|title=Devices of Wonder: From the World in a Box to Images on a Screen|first1=Barbara|last1=Stafford|first2=Frances|last2=Terpak|publisher=Getty Research Institute, U.S|date=1 February 2002|isbn=978-0892365906|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various artists took part in the creation, including [[Steinlen]], [[Adolphe Willette]] and [[Albert Robida]]. [[Caran d'Ache]] designed circa 50 cut-outs for the very popular 1888 show ''L'Epopée''. [[Musée d'Orsay]] has circa 40 original zinc figures in its collection.

In Italy, the [[Museum of Precinema]] collezione Minici Zotti in [[Padua]] houses a collection of 70 French shadow puppets, similar to those used in the cabaret Le Chat Noir, together with an original theatre and painted backdrops, as well as two magic lanterns for projecting scenes. So far, the shadow plays identified are ''La Marche a l'étoile'' (introduced by Henri Rivière), ''Le Sphinx'' (introduced by Amédée Vignola), ''L'Âge d'or'' and ''Le Carneval de Venise'', and it is supposed that the shadow puppets were created for a tour in France or abroad at the end of the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Shadow puppetry today==

[[File:Karagoz theatre 06315.JPG|Shadow [[puppeteer]], 2006|thumb]]

In the 1910s the [[Germany|German]] animator [[Lotte Reiniger]] pioneered [[silhouette animation]] as a format, whereby shadow-play-like puppets are filmed [[stop motion|frame-by-frame]]. This technique has been kept alive by subsequent animators and is still practised today, though [[Traditional animation|cel animation]] and [[computer animation]] has also been used to imitate the look of shadow play and silhouette animation. Traditional Chinese shadow puppetry was brought to audiences in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s through the efforts of [[Pauline Benton]]. Contemporary artists such as [[Annie Katsura Rollins]] have perpetuated the medium, sometimes combining the form with Western theatre.&lt;ref name="Shadow Woman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayter-Menzies|first=Grant|title=Shadow Woman: The Extraordinary Career of Pauline Benton|date=2013|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|isbn=978-0-7735-8909-4|pages=158–159|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=He9sAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=%22Annie%20Katsura%20Rollins%22&amp;pg=PA157#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shadow theatre itself is still popular in many parts of Asia. [[Prahlad Acharya]] is one famous [[India]]n magician who incorporates it into his performances.

In the 2010s, performer Tom McDonagh introduced [[Stereoscopy|3-D]] shadow puppets and use of laser-cut objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencefriday.com/video/08/02/2013/dark-art.html|title=Dark Art|work=Science Friday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also appears occasionally in [[Western culture|western]] [[popular culture]], for example in:

'''Souls Grown Deep Foundation''' is a non-profit organization dedicated to documenting, preserving, and promoting the work of leading contemporary African American artists from the Southeastern United States. Its mission is to include their contributions in the canon of American art history through acquisitions from its collection by major museums, as well as through exhibitions, programs, and publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/foundation|title=About Souls Grown Deep Foundation {{!}} Souls Grown Deep Foundation|website=www.soulsgrowndeep.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation derives its name from a 1921 poem by [[Langston Hughes]] (1902-67) titled "The Negro Speaks of Rivers," the last line of which is "My soul has grown deep like the rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/negro-speaks-rivers|title=The Negro Speaks of Rivers|last=aapone|date=2003-04-10|website=The Negro Speaks of Rivers|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation is led by [[Maxwell L. Anderson]], who serves as its President, and a member of its Board of Trustees. Anderson was previously director of the [[Dallas Museum of Art]] and the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/people|title=People {{!}} Souls Grown Deep Foundation|website=www.soulsgrowndeep.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection==
The Souls Grown Deep Foundation Collection contains over 1,100 works by more than 160 artists, two-thirds of whom are women. Ranging from large-scale assemblages to works on paper, the Foundation is particularly strong in works dating from the death of Martin Luther King, Jr. to the end of the twentieth century. The roots of these works can be traced to slave cemeteries and secluded woods. Following the Civil War, when the southern agrarian economy collapsed and rural African American sharecroppers and tenant farmers were forced to migrate for survival to major population centers—particularly in and around Birmingham, Alabama, where iron and steel production created jobs—a new and more public language of quilts, funerary, and yard arts arose. Beyond painting, sculpture, assemblage, drawing, and textile-making, this tradition also included music, dance, oral literature, informal theater, culinary arts, and more. Much like jazz musicians, the artists of this tradition reflect the rich, symbolic world of the black rural South through highly charged works that address a wide range of revelatory social and political subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/foundation|title=About Souls Grown Deep Foundation {{!}} Souls Grown Deep Foundation|website=www.soulsgrowndeep.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
Souls Grown Deep Foundation was founded in 2010, but traces its roots to the mid-1980s, when [[William Arnett|William S. Arnett]], an art historian and collector, began to collect the artworks of largely undiscovered African American artists across nine southeastern states. Developed outside of the structure of schools, galleries, and museums, these rich yet largely unknown African American visual art traditions present a distinct post–Civil Rights phenomenon that offers powerful insight and fresh perspectives into the most compelling political and social issues of our time. The majority of the works and ephemeral documents held by the Foundation were compiled by Arnett and his sons over three decades, with the goal of creating a collection that could serve as a record and legacy of this culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/177156/from-the-deep-south-an-overlooked-chapter-in-art-history/|title=From the Deep South, an Overlooked Chapter in Art History|date=2015-01-24|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2017-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1990s Arnett’s efforts culminated in an ambitious survey exhibition of this tradition titled ''[http://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/exhibition/souls-grown-deep-african-american-vernacular-art-south Souls Grown Deep: African American Vernacular Art of the South]'', presented in conjunction with the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta and in partnership with the City of Atlanta and the [[Michael C. Carlos Museum]] of Emory University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/01/arts/at-the-atlanta-games-culture-will-be-a-serious-competitor.html|title=At the Atlanta Games, Culture Will Be a Serious Competitor|last=Applebome|first=Peter|date=1995-02-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-30|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent two-volume publication ''Souls Grown Deep: African American Vernacular Art of the South'', remains the most in-depth examination of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Souls-Grown-Deep-Vol-Vernacular/dp/0965376605/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1467216226&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=souls%20grown%20deep|title=Souls Grown Deep, Vol. 1: African American Vernacular Art of the South: The Tree Gave the Dove a Leaf|date=September 2000|publisher=Tinwood Books|isbn=9780965376600|editor-last=Arnett|editor-first=Paul|location=Atlanta, Ga.: Tinwood Books|language=English|editor-last2=Arnett|editor-first2=William S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several exhibitions in recent years have drawn works primarily from the collection today in the care of the Souls Grown Deep Foundation, including ''[http://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/exhibition/quilts-gees-bend The Quilts of Gee’s Bend]'', organized by the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]] and the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] in 2002, which traveled to the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]], [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], [[Chrysler Museum of Art]], [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], [[High Museum of Art]], and four other museums;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/29/arts/art-review-jazzy-geometry-cool-quilters.html|title=ART REVIEW; Jazzy Geometry, Cool Quilters|last=Kimmelman|first=Michael|date=2002-11-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-30|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[http://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/exhibition/thornton-dial-21st-century Thornton Dial in the 21st Century]'' at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]] in 2006;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/exhibition/thornton-dial-21st-century|title=Thornton Dial in the 21st Century {{!}} Souls Grown Deep Foundation|website=www.soulsgrowndeep.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[http://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/exhibition/hard-truths-art-thornton-dial Hard Truths: The Art of Thornton Dial]'', organized by the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] in 2011, which traveled to the [[New Orleans Museum of Art]], the [[Mint Museum]], and the [[High Museum of Art]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.high.org/exhibition/hard-truths-the-art-of-thornton-dial/|title=Hard Truths: The Art of Thornton Dial|work=High Museum of Art|access-date=2017-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[https://www.high.org/exhibition/fever-within/ Fever Within: The Art of Ronald Lockett]'', organized by the [[Ackland Art Museum]] in 2016, which traveled to the [[American Folk Art Museum]] and the [[High Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.high.org/exhibition/fever-within/|title=Fever Within: The Art of Ronald Lockett|work=High Museum of Art|access-date=2017-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transfer of collection ==
In 2014 the Souls Grown Deep Foundation began a multi-year program to transfer the majority of works in its care to the permanent collections of leading American and international art museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/news/souls-grown-deep-foundation-begins-series-giftspurchases-major-national-museums|title=Souls Grown Deep Foundation Begins Series of Gifts/Purchases by Major National Museums {{!}} Souls Grown Deep Foundation|website=www.soulsgrowndeep.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, this program has led to the acquisition of over 200 works by 75 artists from the Foundation’s collection by museums including [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|The Metropolitan Museum of Art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/press/news/2014/souls-grown-deep|title=Souls Grown Deep Foundation Donates 57 Works to Metropolitan Museum of Art {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deyoung.famsf.org/press-room/fine-arts-museums-san-francisco-make-historic-acquisition-62-works-african-american-art|title=Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco Make Historic Acquisition of 62 Works of African American Art from the Souls Grown Deep Foundation|date=2017-02-02|work=de Young|access-date=2017-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[High Museum of Art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/arts/design/high-museum-thornton-dial.html|title=High Museum Acquires 54 African-American Artworks|last=Chow|first=Andrew R.|date=2017-04-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-30|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[New Orleans Museum of Art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2017/07/06/new-orleans-museum-of-art-acquires-10-works-from-souls-grown-deep-foundation/|title=New Orleans Museum of Art Acquires 10 Works from Souls Grown Deep Foundation|last=Twersky|first=Carolyn|date=2017-07-06|website=ARTnews|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Ackland Art Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uncnews.unc.edu/2017/09/14/acklandsouls/|title=Ackland Art Museum acquires 12 artworks from Souls Grown Deep Foundation - UNC News|date=2017-09-14|work=UNC News|access-date=2017-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as multiple major exhibitions and publications including [https://deyoung.famsf.org/exhibitions/revelations-art-african-american-south "Revelations: Art from the African American South"] at the [[De Young (museum)|de Young Museum]] in San Francisco.

'''''Standing Horse''''' is a [[Tang dynasty tomb figures|Tang dynasty tomb figure]], created during the [[Tang dynasty]] in [[China]]. In ancient China, numerous tomb figurines and other artefacts were designed specifically to be [[Funerary art|buried with the deceased]] in large [[Tumulus|burial mounds]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michaelson|first1=Carol|title=Gilded Dragons: Buried Treasures from China's Golden Ages (exhibition catalogue)|date=1999|publisher=British Museum Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacGregory|first1=Neil|title=Chinese Tang tomb figures|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/9mtCv5mCQ-iz_PRF2p0phw|website=A History of the World in 100 Objects|publisher=BBC/British Museum|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This large figurine is glazed with the iconic tri-colour glaze, also known as [[Sancai]], which is a [[Ceramic glaze|glazing technique]] that is synonymous to the Tang dynasty.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=Nigel|title=Chinese glazes: their origins, chemistry, and recreation|date=1999|publisher=A.C. Black|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eckfeld|first1=Tonia|title=Imperial Tombs in Tang China, 618-907: The Politics of Paradise|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Form, material and technique ==
[[File:Gansu Museum 2007 257.jpg|thumb|[[Gansu Flying Horse]], Han dynasty, made of bronze.|left]]
The [[Shape|form]] of this [[sculpture]] appears to be harmoniously [[Symmetry|symmetrical]] at first glance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Kenneth Louis|title=Handbook of visual communication: theory, methods, and media|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on further scrutiny, it is clear that the shape of the sculpture is deeply organic, revealing a varied contour of curves and edges. When a spotlight is shone on the sculpture, deep pockets of [[shadows]] on the sculpture contrast starkly with illuminating highlights that reflect off its shiny, glazed surface.

As a historical artefact that is more than 1000-year-old, it is very well-preserved. It was created with [[earthenware]], which is a durable material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Medley|first1=Margaret|title=The Chinese Potter: A Practical History of Chinese Ceramics|date=1989|publisher=Phaidon|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vainker|first1=S.J.|title=Chinese Pottery and Porcelain|date=1991|publisher=British Museum Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bronze and wood were 2 other materials commonly used to create sculptures and tomb artefacts in this period and region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Valenstein|first1=Suzanne|title=A handbook of Chinese ceramics|date=1998|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howard|first1=Angela Falco|title=Chinese Sculpture|date=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|location=Connecticut}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, earthenware was a more practical material for tomb artefacts because it was more affordable than bronze, and more durable than wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thorp|first1=Robert L.|last2=Vinograd|first2=Richard E.|title=Chinese Art and Culture|date=2003|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sancai'' technique literally means ‘three colours’. However, the colours of the glazes were not limited to three in number. This technique is especially associated with the Tang Dynasty. The ''Sancai'' glaze is highly durable – most ceramics glazed with this technique has endured till today.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The use of ''Sancai'' glazing on figures was expensive and required skilful craftsmanship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Sumptuary law]]s also restricted the usage of ''Sancai'' glaze to the [[upper class]]es, and production was controlled by the [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|imperial bureaucracy.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=藝文類聚, Yiwen Leiju - a Tang Chinese leishu encyclopedia|last=Ouyang|first=Xun|publisher=|year=624|isbn=|location=Tang China|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:A Sancai piece.webm|thumb|200x200px|Short video of a ''sancai'' tomb guardian.]]

== Iconography  ==
''An iconography of a work of art is the analysis of the visual images and symbols employed.''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance|last=Panofsky|first=Erwin|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1939|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As an [[Allegory|expressional]] subject matter, this figurine of a [[horse]] is depicted proportionally and realistically, with great attention paid to its [[Proportionality (mathematics)|anatomical accuracy]], colour treatment, [[texture (visual arts)|texture]] and [[Ornament (art)|embellishments]].

The high level of craftsmanship reflected on this sculpture demonstrate the lifelikeness and physical characteristics that this horse is supposed to embody: a handsome adult horse with an athletic body and a body of mane that is smooth, shiny and neat. Its [[Posture (psychology)|posture]] is upright, its eyes are wide-opened and its head cocked at an angle that is upright but not facing upward.

The colours applied on this horse further enhance the lifelikeness of the horse, making it look very similar to a real horse. The contrast of green against brown on this sculpture, directs the viewer's attention immediately to the elaborate [[Horse harness|harness]] on the horse, so that viewers would notice the distinctive decoration on this harness.

The intricate details rendered on the horse's harness offers viewers an insight into the type of horse this sculpture is supposed to represent: a [[Ferghana horse]] from [[Central Asia]]. Ferghana horses were very commonly depicted in [[Tang dynasty tomb figures]].&lt;ref name="Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hay|first1=Jonathan|title=Seeing through dead eyes: How early Tang tombs staged the afterlife|journal=RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics|date=2010|issue=57/58|pages=16–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iconology ==
''An iconology of a work of art is the interpretation of the symbolism in the visual imagery, especially in a broader sociopolitical context, so as to determine the underlying attitudes and characteristics of a civilisation.''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Caring for the afterlife ===
[[File:Hun Po soul.jpg|thumb|272x272px|In ancient China, it was believed that every person has 2 souls: the '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''hun''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' soul and the '''po''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' soul.]]
The ancient Chinese believed that every person has 2 souls – 1 is called ‘''[[Hun and po|hun]]''’ and the other is called ‘''[[Hun and po|po]]''’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harrell|first=Stevan|date=1979|title=The Concept of Soul in Chinese Folk Religion|url=|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|volume=38|pages=519–528}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a person passes on, the ''hun'' soul leaves the body and ascends to [[heaven]], while the ''po'' soul remains with the [[corpse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hu|first=Shih|date=1946|title=The Concept of Immortality in Chinese Thought|url=|journal=Harvard Divinity School Bulletin|volume=|pages=26–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient China, tomb artefacts were created specifically for the ''po'' soul to use in its [[afterlife]], according to what the deceased usually needed and wanted when he or she was alive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The primary purpose of a tomb artefact was to care for its deceased master in his or her afterlife. Therefore, studying the tomb artefacts from different [[Dynasties in Chinese history|Chinese dynasties]] helps one to understand the changing [[social]] and [[History|historical]] circumstances of each dynasty, since the people of different dynasties had different [[need]]s and [[want]]s, depending on the sociopolitical situation of each dynasty.   
[[File:Terracotta army 5256.jpg|thumb|Part of a terracotta army from the [[Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor]]. |left|150x150px]]
For instance, numerous tomb [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] of [[soldier]]s (also known as a "[[Terracotta Army|terracotta army]]") have been found in the [[Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor]]. The [[Qin dynasty]] was [[Militarism|militaristic]], heavy-handed and [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] - it was a time of intense and constant [[war]]fare with its neighbours and its military was the most powerful and [[Technology|technologically]] advanced in the world.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Early Chinese Empires: Qin and Han|last=Lewis|first=Mark Edward|publisher=Belknap Press|year=2007|isbn=9780674024779|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is unsurprising to find an overwhelming quantity of tomb figurines cast in the image of soldiers in the tomb of [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first emperor of China.

On the other hand, we find [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1994.285a-m/ this chessboard set] in a tomb from the [[Han dynasty]]. The Han dynasty was still a time of constant warfare.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, [[The arts|arts]] and [[culture]] were valued and widespread, and the Han Chinese had more [[Liberty|freedom]] to [[debate]] [[Philosophy|philosophical]] issues and enjoy [[intellectual]] [[game]]s, such as this game of [[chess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Old World Encounters: Cross Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times|last=Bentley|first=Jerry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chess was believed to help people understand [[Military strategy|military strategies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Chess|last=Murray|first=H. J. R.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1913|isbn=0198274033|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Tang dynasty, the [[Political sociology|socio-political]] condition of China was dramatically different from the Qin and Han dynasties, leading to the production of tomb artefacts that were dramatically different too. Tang dynasty was one that was characterized by its extravagance, prosperity, stability and competitiveness, and these attributes are understandably reflected in the characteristics of tomb figurines produced in the Tang dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=T'ang China: The Rise of the East in World History|last=Adshead|first=S. A. M.|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2004|isbn=1403934568|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assertion of Tang power ===
[[File:East-Hem 800ad.jpg|thumb|Sandwiched between East Asia and West Asia, Central Asia was characterised by conflicts and political pressure as the [[empire]]s and states of East and West Asia often vied for control over Central Asia.|150x150px]]Another theme that is critical in the interpretation of this figurine of a Central Asian horse is the tense relationship between the [[nomad]]s of Central Asia and the rest of [[Asia]]. Every dynasty in China had military [[Conflict of interest|conflicts]] with the nomads of Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Inner Asia|last=Soucek|first=Svatopluk|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tang empire competed fiercely with the [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibetan]] empire and the [[Islamic empires]] for control of Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=East Asia: A Cultural, Social and Political History|last=Ebrey|first=Patricia Buckley|last2=Walthall|first2=Anne|last3=Palais|first3=James B.|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=2006|isbn=0618133844|location=Boston|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tibetan Empire in Central Asia|last=Beckwith|first=Christopher I.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1987|isbn=0691024693|location=Princeton|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nomads of Central Asia were fierce [[warrior]]s with powerful [[Horses in warfare|warhorses]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient China and Its Enemies: the Rise of Nomadic Power in East Asian History|last=Di Cosmo|first=Nicola|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521770645|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to a combination of [[Geography|geographical]] and [[Politics|political]] reasons. Geographically, Central Asia is difficult for [[agriculture]] and it is also far from the [[sea]], thereby cutting it off from [[Trade|trading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gernet|first=Jacques|date=1996|title=A History of Chinese Civilization|url=|journal=9780521497817|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, nomadic horse people dominated Central Asia for 2000 years.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Their nomadic lifestyle naturally trained them to be highly suitable for warfare. Their [[Equestrianism|horse-riding]] skills and [[archery]] techniques made them the most militarily powerful people in the world. Their military power is further sharpened by the fact that [[East Asia]] and [[Western Asia|West Asia]] were often competing to gain control of Central Asia.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
[[File:2015-09-23-090637 - Historisches Museum, Dreifarbiges Kamel (Tang Dynastie 618-907).jpg|thumb|A ''sancai'' tomb figurine depicting a Central Asian camel.]]
It is in light of this socio-historical context that one realises why it was a source of pride for a Tang dynasty tomb to be filled with horses, camels, female attendants, robust [[Domestic worker|manservants]] and exotic dancers from Central Asia. During the Tang period, the ability to [[Horses in East Asian warfare|own powerful horses]] and servants from Central Asia would have been a testimony of a person's wealth, power and [[Social stratification|social standing]]. This is especially since Central Asia was renowned for its military power, strong warriors and formidable horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Warfare in Chinese History|last=van de Ven|first=Hans|last2=Twitchett|first2=Denis|publisher=Koninklijke Brill|year=2000|isbn=9004117741|location=Leiden|pages=|chapter=Tibet in Tang's Grand Strategy}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would also have been reflective of a person's [[Fashion|stylish]], [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] taste, as it shows that this person is globalised and familiar with [[culture]]s outside of China.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=China's Cosmopolitan Empire: The Tang Dynasty|last=Lewis|first=Mark Edward|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780674033061|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Tang dynasty's tomb artefacts, such as ''Standing Horse'', were meant to assert Tang China's power over Central Asia.

=== Opulence of Tang society ===

[[File:Joueuse de polo Tang Guimet 29101.jpg|thumb|150x150px|A Tang dynasty tomb figurine of a woman playing polo.]]
Tang dynasty is generally regarded as a high point in Chinese [[Civilization|civilisation]], and a [[Golden Age|golden age]] of cosmopolitan culture.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Many neighbouring countries maintained strong [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] ties with it, traded extensively with it and sought its [[Economy|economic]] assistance and military protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sui-Tang China and Its Turko-Mongol Neighbors: Culture, Power and Connections, 580-800|last=Skaff|first=Jonathan Karam|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=978019-9996278|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[superpower]], akin to the [[United States]] of today.

The [[Capital city|capital]] of the Tang dynasty was the most populous city in the world.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; With this large [[population]], the dynasty was able to have a professional and powerful [[army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Draft Discussion of Early Tang Dynasty's Military Affairs History|last=Wang|first=Yongxing|publisher=Kunlun Press|year=2003|isbn=7800406695|location=Beijing|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The army not only defended the [[empire]], but was also used to dominate the lucrative [[trade route]]s along the [[Silk Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Silk Road: Monks, Warriors &amp; Merchants|last=Boulnois|first=Luce|publisher=Odyssey Books|year=2005|isbn=9622177212|location=Hong Kong|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A huge population also meant that there were more professional craftsmen in the empire, to create large quantities and higher quality works of art.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=China's Golden Age: Everyday Life in the Tang dynasty|last=Benn|first=Charles|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=0195176650|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a period of progress, prosperity and stability, making it a highly conducive environment to pursue the arts.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Tomb figurines in the Tang dynasty often featured servants, attendants, dancers, musicians, [[camel]]s and horses from Central Asia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the tomb of a high-ranking male, there may also be figurines of soldiers, [[official]]s and [[courtesan]]s.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Performativity of Tang tomb figurines ===
[[File:Tomb figurine of a horse, China, Tang dynasty, early 600s AD, glazed earthenware - Östasiatiska museet, Stockholm - DSC09590.JPG|thumb|Earthenware figurine of a horse not glazed with ''Sancai'' - typically for someone wealthy but not an aristocrat or high-ranking official.]]
[[File:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - tri-coloured figure of a civil official.jpg|left|thumb|''Sancai''-glazed figurine of a civil official from the Tang dynasty.]]
Tomb figurines in the Tang dynasty were made to be [[Attractiveness|visually compelling]] and it is especially obvious when they are seen in an entire set, or when compared with figurines of other dynasties.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/calendar/tang-cosmopolitanism/|title=Performing in the afterlife: performance and performativity of Tang tomb art|last=Lin|first=Wei-Cheng|date=|website="Tang Cosmopolitanism: An Interdisciplinary Symposium" by Art Gallery of New South Wales|access-date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intricate details of each figurine's craftsmanship imbue them with a great sense of physical [[Metaphysics of presence|presence]] and [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]].&lt;ref name="Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard" /&gt; Their personalised [[facial expression]]s and postures distinguish each figurine in an imaginable [[time]] and [[space]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

This great emphasis on the [[performativity]] of tomb figurines could be related to the [[Competitiveness|competitive]] Tang culture of [[Exhibition|publicly displaying]] one's wealth and power.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The [[social class]]es of Tang society were mobile. This means that people in the different social classes could improve its status through [[Diligence|hard work]] and move to an upper class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wong|first=Timothy C.|date=1979|title=Self and Society in Tang Dynasty Love Tales|url=|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=99|pages=95–100|jstor=598956}}&lt;/ref&gt; This created a competitive society, where people often showed off their wealth and power. Members of prominent families or high-ranking officials often paraded through streets in the public, with troops of servants mounted on beautiful horses.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This culture of public display takes place even during [[funeral]]s. After the funerary ceremonies at home are complete, there would be a [[funeral procession]] to transport the deceased from home to [[grave]]site.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=通典 - Tongdian, a Tang Chinese institutional history and encyclopedia text|last=Du|first=You|publisher=|year=801|isbn=|location=Tang China|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Plat à offrandes Chine Musée Guimet 2418 3.jpg|thumb|150x150px|A Tang dynasty plate glazed in ''Sancai''.]]
The funeral procession is a highly elaborate, visible and competitive public [[spectacle]], designed to impress the public with [[altar]]s, canopies, flowers, paper figurines, burnt offerings and most importantly, with the display of impressive tomb figurines.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The competitive nature of funeral processions got so out of hand, that the emperor had to issue imperial edicts to regulate the quantity and size of tomb figurines, according to the deceased's social status.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Tomb artefacts were meant to glorify its deceased master and the master's living family.

Tomb figurines of the Tang dynasty were characterized by its wide variety, high quality, energy, performance and lifelikeness.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The tomb figurines of Tang China were unprecedented – never before in Chinese history were the figurines endowed with such qualities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The pursuit of more and more vibrant colours led to the invention of the tri-colour glazing technique, or ''Sancai'' glaze, to further enhance the visual appearance of the figurines.&lt;ref name="Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard" /&gt; This great emphasis on performance burial and extravagant tomb figurines in Tang China, is consistent with Tang China's opulent culture, media and arts. This tomb figurine of a horse, was expected to represent not only itself, but also expected to serve and perform a social and cultural role for the Tang dynasty.

The '''Terracotta Army''' is a collection of [[terracotta]] sculptures depicting the armies of [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first [[Emperor of China]]. It is a form of [[funerary art]] buried with the emperor in 210–209 BCE with the purpose of protecting the emperor in his afterlife.

The figures, dating from approximately the late third century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=TL dating of pottery sherds and baked soil from the Xian Terracotta Army Site, Shaanxi Province, China |author=Lu Yanchou, Zhang Jingzhao, Xie Jun |journal= International Journal of Radiation Applications and Instrumentation.

The figures vary in height according to their roles, with the tallest being the generals. The figures include warriors, [[Chariot (Ancient China)|chariots]] and horses. Estimates from 2007 were that the three pits containing the Terracotta Army held more than 8,000 soldiers, 130 chariots with 520 horses, and 150 cavalry horses, the majority of which remained buried in the pits near [[Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor|Qin Shi Huang's mausoleum]].{{sfn|Portal|2007|p=167}} Other terracotta non-military figures were found in other pits, including [[Court (royal)#Court officials|officials]], [[Acrobatics|acrobats]], [[strongman (strength athlete)|strongmen]], and musicians.

== History ==
[[File:秦始皇帝陵.JPG|thumb|right|The mound where the tomb is located]]
The construction of the tomb was described by historian [[Sima Qian]] (145{{ndash}}90 BCE) in his most noted work ''[[Shiji]]'', written a century after the mausoleum's completion.  Work on the mausoleum began in 246 BCE soon after Emperor Qin (then aged 13) ascended the throne, and the project eventually involved 700,000 workers.&lt;ref name="chinesetext"/&gt; Geographer [[Li Daoyuan]], writing six centuries after the First Emperor's death, recorded in ''[[Shui Jing Zhu]]'' that Mount Li was a favoured location due to its auspicious geology, "famed for its jade mines, its northern side was rich in gold, and its southern side rich in beautiful jade; the First Emperor, covetous of its fine reputation, therefore chose to be buried there".{{sfn|Clements|2007|p = 158}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E6%B0%B4%E7%B6%93%E6%B3%A8/19 Shui Jing Zhu Chapter 19] 《水经注·渭水》'''Original text:''' 秦始皇大兴厚葬，营建冢圹于骊戎之山，一名蓝田，其阴多金，其阳多美玉，始皇贪其美名，因而葬焉。&lt;/ref&gt; Sima Qian wrote that the First Emperor was buried with palaces, towers, officials, valuable artifacts and wondrous objects. According to this account, 100 flowing rivers were simulated using mercury, and above them the ceiling was decorated with heavenly bodies below which were the features of the land. Some translations of this passage refer to "models" or "imitations"; however, those words were not used in the original text, which makes no mention of the terracotta army.&lt;ref name="chinesetext"&gt;[http://ctext.org/pre-qin-and-han?filter=d270 Sima Qian –  Shiji Volume 6] 《史记·秦始皇本纪》 '''Original text:''' {{lang|zh-hans|始皇初即位，穿治郦山，及并天下，天下徒送诣七十余万人，穿三泉，下铜而致椁，宫观百官奇器珍怪徙臧满之。令匠作机驽矢，有所穿近者辄射之。以水银为百川江河大海，机相灌输，上具天文，下具地理。以人鱼膏为烛，度不灭者久之。二世曰："先帝后宫非有子者，出焉不宜。" 皆令从死，死者甚众。葬既已下，或言工匠为机，臧皆知之，臧重即泄。大事毕，已臧，闭中羡，下外羡门，尽闭工匠臧者，无复出者。树草木以象山。}} '''Translation:'''  When the First Emperor ascended the throne, the digging and preparation at Mount Li began. After he unified his empire, 700,000 men were sent there from all over his empire. They dug down deep to underground springs, pouring copper to place the outer casing of the coffin. Palaces and viewing towers housing a hundred officials were built and filled with treasures and rare artifacts. Workmen were instructed to make automatic crossbows primed to shoot at intruders. Mercury was used to simulate the hundred rivers, the Yangtze and Yellow River, and the great sea, and set to flow mechanically. Above, the heaven is depicted, below, the geographical features of the land. Candles were made of "mermaid"'s fat which is calculated to burn and not extinguish for a long time. The Second Emperor said: "It is inappropriate for the wives of the late emperor who have no sons to be free", ordered that they should accompany the dead, and a great many died. After the burial, it was suggested that it would be a serious breach if the craftsmen who constructed the tomb and knew of its treasure were to divulge those secrets.

The Terracotta Army is part of a much larger [[necropolis]].  Ground-penetrating radar and core sampling have measured the area to be approximately 98 square kilometers (38 square miles).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/10/china-first-emperor-terra-cotta-warriors-tomb/?sf38672445=1|title=Discoveries May Rewrite History of China's Terra-Cotta Warriors|date=12 October 2016|access-date=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The necropolis was constructed as a microcosm of the emperor's imperial palace or compound, and covers a large area around the tomb mound of the first emperor. The earthen tomb mound is located at the foot of Mount Li and built in a [[Chinese pyramids|pyramidal]] shape,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=73号 Qin Ling Bei Lu |url=http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;source=embed&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=34.38130,+109.25365&amp;aq=&amp;sll=53.800651,-4.064941&amp;sspn=14.588871,37.265625&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;ll=34.381864,109.254398&amp;spn=0.004967,0.009098&amp;z=16 |title=Google maps |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is surrounded by two solidly built [[rammed earth]] walls with gateway entrances. The necropolis consists of several offices, halls, stables, other structures as well as an imperial park placed around the tomb mound.

The warriors stand guard to the east of the tomb. Up to {{convert|5|m}} of reddish, sandy soil had accumulated over the site in the two millennia following its construction, but archaeologists found evidence of earlier disturbances at the site. During the excavations near the Mount Li burial mound, archaeologists found several graves dating from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, where diggers had apparently struck terracotta fragments. These were discarded as worthless and used along with soil to back fill the excavations.{{sfn|Clements|2007|p=160}}

=== Tomb ===

The soldiers within were laid out as if to protect the tomb from the east, where the Qin Emperor's conquered states lay.

====Pit 1====
Pit 1, which is {{convert|230|m}} long and {{convert|62|m}} wide,&lt;ref name="Lothar"&gt;{{harvnb|Ledderose|1998|pp=51–73}} [https://www.scribd.com/doc/6694321/LedderoseA-Magic-Army-for-the-Emperor A Magic Army for the Emperor]&lt;/ref&gt; contains the main army of more than 6,000 figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/kuaixun/74862.htm |title=The Mausoleum of the First Emperor of the Qin Dynasty and Terracotta Warriors and Horses |publisher=China.org.cn |date=12 September 2003 |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pit 1 has eleven corridors, most more than {{convert|3|m|round=5}} wide and paved with small bricks with a wooden ceiling supported by large beams and posts. This design was also used for the tombs of nobles and would have resembled palace hallways when built. The wooden ceilings were covered with reed mats and layers of clay for waterproofing, and then mounded with more [[soil]] raising them about {{convert|2|to|3|m}} above the surrounding ground level when completed.{{sfn|Portal|2007}}

==== Others ====

Pit 2 has cavalry and infantry units as well as [[Chariot (China)|war chariots]] and is thought to represent a military guard. Pit 3 is the command post, with high-ranking officers and a war chariot. Pit 4 is empty, perhaps left unfinished by its builders.

Some of the figures in Pits 1 and 2 show fire damage, while remains of burnt ceiling rafters have also been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8676886.stm |title=China unearths 114 new Terracotta Warriors |publisher=BBC News  |date=12 May 2010|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These, together with the missing weapons, have been taken as evidence of the reported looting by Xiang Yu and the subsequent burning of the site, which is thought to have caused the roof to collapse and crush the army figures below. The terracotta figures currently on display have been restored from the fragments.

Other pits that formed the necropolis have also been excavated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/cityguides/xian/terracotta/pits.htm |title=Terracotta Accessory Pits |publisher=Travelchinaguide.com |date=10 October 2009 |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pits lie within and outside the walls surrounding the tomb mound. They variously contain bronze carriages, terracotta figures of entertainers such as acrobats and strongmen, officials, stone armour suits, burial sites of horses, rare animals and labourers, as well as bronze cranes and ducks set in an underground park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/m/daminggong/2010-05/13/content_9845517_3.htm |title=Decoding the Mausoleum of Emperor Qin Shihuang |work=China Daily  |date=13 May 2010 |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Warrior figures ==

===Types and appearance===

[[File:I was impressed with the life-like expression (35300697030).jpg|thumb|left|A terracotta soldier]]
The terracotta figures are life-sized. They vary in height, uniform, and hairstyle in accordance with rank. Their faces appear to be different for each individual figure; scholars, however, have identified 10 basic face shapes.&lt;ref name="national geographic"&gt;{{cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=TrPmZXt-wIEC|page=27}} |title =The Terra Cotta Warriors |work=National Geographic Museum |page=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The figures are of these general types: armored warriors; unarmored [[infantrymen]]; [[cavalrymen]] who wear a pillbox hat; helmeted drivers of chariots with more armor protection; spear-carrying charioteers; kneeling archers who are armored; standing archers who are not; as well as generals and other lower-ranking officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=DbtrAwAAQBAJ|page=110}}|title=The Terracotta Warriors: The Secret Codes of the Emperor's Army |first= Maurice |last=Cotterell |publisher=Inner Traditions Bear and Company|date=June 2004|isbn=978-1591430339 |pages=105–112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, many variations in the uniforms within the ranks: for example, some may wear shin pads while others not; they may wear either long or short trousers, some of which may be padded; and their body armors vary depending on rank, function, and position in formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=DbtrAwAAQBAJ|page=103}}|title=The Terracotta Warriors: The Secret Codes of the Emperor's Army |first= Maurice |last=Cotterell |publisher=Inner Traditions Bear and Company|date=June 2004|isbn=978-1591430339 |pages=103–105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also terracotta horses placed among the warrior figures.

[[File:Recreated colored terracotta warriors.jpg|thumb|Recreated figures of an archer and an officer, showing how they would have looked when painted]]

Originally, the figures were painted with bright pigments, variously coloured pink, red, green, blue, black, brown, white and lilac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Simpson, Greg Hurst 3 December 2011 12:01&amp;nbsp;am |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article2414695.ece |title=Terracotta soldier – in full colour |work=The Times |location=UK |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-09/09/content_11278335.htm |title=Terracotta army emerges in its true colors |work=China Daily  |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coloured lacquer finish and individual facial features would have given the figures a realistic feel. However, much of the colour coating had flaked off or become greatly faded.

Some scholars have speculated a possible [[Hellenistic]] link to these sculptures, because of the lack of life-sized and realistic sculptures before the Qin dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soas.ac.uk/news/newsitem89619.html Early links with West likely inspiration for Terracotta Warriors, argues SOAS scholar], School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lukas Nickel, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9035632 The First Emperor and sculpture in China], SOAS, University of London, Cambridge University Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that potential Greek influence is particularly evident in some terracotta figures such as those of acrobats, as well as the technique used for casting bronze sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-37624943 |title=Western contact with China began long before Marco Polo, experts say |date=12 October 2016 |work=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/china-terracotta-army-ancient-greek-sculptors-alexander-the-great-marco-polo-a7357606.html | title = Ancient Greeks may have built China's famous Terracotta Army – 1,500 years before Marco Polo| last = Johnston | first = Ian | date = 13 October 2016 | website = Independent.co.uk | access-date = 14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this idea is disputed by scholars and it has been pointed out that there is "no substantial evidence at all" for contact between ancient Greeks and Chinese builders of the tomb.&lt;ref name=han-sil&gt;{{cite web |author1 = Hanink, Johanna | author2 = Silva, Felipe Rojas |date= 20 November 2016 | url=https://www.livescience.com/56939-china-terracotta-warriors-stir-controversy.html |title=Why China's Terracotta Warriors Are Stirring Controversy |publisher=Live Science}} Originally published in {{cite web|last1=Hanink&lt;!-- Associate Professor of Classics, Brown University  --&gt;|first1=Johanna|last2=Silva&lt;!-- Assistant Professor of Archaeology and the Ancient World, Brown University --&gt;|first2=Felipe Rojas|title=Why there's so much backlash to the theory that Greek art inspired China's Terracotta Army|url=https://theconversation.com/why-theres-so-much-backlash-to-the-theory-that-greek-art-inspired-chinas-terracotta-army-67488|publisher=The Conversation|date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that such speculations in its core rest on flawed and old "Eurocentric" ideas that assumed other civilizations were incapable of sophisticated artistry and thus foreign artistry must be seen through western traditions.&lt;ref name=han-sil/&gt;

===Construction===
The terracotta army figures were manufactured in workshops by government laborers and local craftsmen using local materials. Heads, arms, legs, and torsos were created separately and then assembled by [[luting]] the pieces together. When completed, the terracotta figures were placed in the pits in precise military formation according to rank and duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upf.edu/materials/huma/central/abast/ledder.htm |title=A Magic Army for the Emperor |publisher=Upf.edu |date=1 October 1979 |accessdate=3 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128181533/http://www.upf.edu/materials/huma/central/abast/ledder.htm |archivedate=28 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The faces were created using [[Molding (process)|molds]], and at least ten face molds may have been used.&lt;ref name="national geographic"/&gt; Clay was then added after assembly to provide individual facial features to make each figure appear different.{{sfn|Portal|2007|p=170}} It is believed that the warriors' legs were made in much the same way that terracotta drainage pipes were manufactured at the time. This would classify the process as [[assembly line]] production, with specific parts manufactured and assembled after being fired, as opposed to crafting one solid piece and subsequently firing it. In those times of tight imperial control, each workshop was required to inscribe its name on items produced to ensure quality control. This has aided modern historians in verifying which workshops were commandeered to make tiles and other mundane items for the terracotta army.

=== Weaponry ===
[[File:Bronze jian of the Terracotta Army.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Bronze ''[[jian]]'' sword with chrome plating]]
Most of the figures originally held real weapons, which would have increased their realism. The majority of these weapons were looted shortly after the creation of the army or have rotted away.  Despite this, over 40,000 bronze items of weaponry have been recovered, including swords, daggers, spears, lances, battle-axes, scimitars, shields, crossbows, and crossbow triggers. Most of the recovered items are arrowheads, which are usually found in bundles of 100 units.&lt;ref name="lecture"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/attraction/shaanxi/xian/terra_cotta_army/weapon_1.htm |title=Exquisite Weaponry of Terra Cotta Army |publisher=Travelchinaguide.com |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Making Weapons for the Terracotta Army |authors= Marcos Martinón-Torres, Xiuzhen Janice Li, Andrew Bevan, Yin Xia, Zhao Kun, Thilo Rehren |date =2011 |journal= Archaeology International|volume= 13 |pages=65–75 |doi=10.5334/ai.1316 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=DbtrAwAAQBAJ|page=99}}|title=The Terracotta Warriors: The Secret Codes of the Emperor's Army |first= Maurice |last=Cotterell |publisher=Inner Traditions Bear and Company|date=June 2004|isbn=978-1591430339 |pages=99–102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of these arrowheads suggests that they were produced by self-sufficient, autonomous workshops using a process referred to as ''cellular production'' or ''[[Toyotism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/chinese-terra-cotta-warriors-had-real-and-very-carefully-made-weapons/2012/11/26/999b9cb4-2840-11e2-b4e0-346287b7e56c_story.html |title=Chinese terra cotta warriors had real, and very carefully made, weapons | first=Jennifer |last=Pinkowski |date=26 November 2012|work=The Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some weapons were coated with a 10–15 micrometer layer of [[chromium dioxide]] before burial that has protected them from any form of decay for the last 2200 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinatourguide.com/xian/terracotta_warriors_details.html|title=Terracotta Warriors (Terracotta Army)|publisher=China Tour Guide|accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=K5PpAAAAMAAJ|page=102}}|title=China's imperial tombs and mausoleums|author=Zhewen Luo|year=1993|publisher=Foreign Languages Press|isbn=978-7-119-01619-1|accessdate=28 June 2010|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The swords contain an alloy of copper, tin, and other elements including nickel, magnesium, and cobalt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/terracottawarriors/assets/tcw-exhibition-eguide.pdf|title=Terracotta Warriors|year=2009|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=28 July 2011}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some carry inscriptions that date their manufacture to between 245 and 228 BCE, indicating that they were used before burial.&lt;ref name="bm"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/PDF/Teachers_resource_pack_30_8a.pdf |title=The First Emperor - China's Terracotta Army - Teacher's Resource Pack |publisher=British Museum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific research ==

In 2007, scientists at [[Stanford University]] and the [[Advanced Light Source]] facility in Berkeley, California reported that [[powder diffraction]] experiments combined with [[energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] and [[micro-X-ray fluorescence]] analysis showed that the process of producing terracotta figures colored with [[Han purple and Han blue|Chinese purple]] dye consisting of [[barium]] [[copper]] [[silicate]] was derived from the knowledge gained by [[Taoist]] [[alchemy|alchemists]] in their attempts to synthesize [[jade]] [[Ornament (art)|ornaments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bertrand|first=Loïc|author2=Robinet, Laurianne |author3=Thoury, Mathieu |author4=Janssens, Koen |author5=Cohen, Serge X. |author6= Schöder, Sebastian |title=Cultural heritage and archaeology materials studied by synchrotron spectroscopy and imaging|journal=[[Applied Physics A]]|date=26 November 2011|volume=106|issue=2|pages=377–396|doi=10.1007/s00339-011-6686-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=Z.|author2=Mehta, A. |author3=Tamura, N. |author4=Pickard, D. |author5=Rong, B. |author6=Zhou, T. |author7= Pianetta, P. |title=Influence of Taoism on the invention of the purple pigment used on the Qin terracotta warriors|journal=[[Journal of Archaeological Science]]|date=November 2007|volume=34|issue=11|pages=1878–1883|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2007.01.005|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440307000131|citeseerx=10.1.1.381.8552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006, an international team of researchers at the [[UCL Institute of Archaeology]] have been using [[analytical chemistry]] techniques to uncover more details about the production techniques employed in the creation of the Terracotta Army. Using [[X-ray fluorescence]] spectrometry of 40,000 bronze [[arrowhead]]s bundled in groups of 100, the researchers reported that the arrowheads within a single bundle formed a relatively tight cluster that was different from other bundles. In addition, the presence or absence of metal impurities was consistent within bundles. Based on the arrows’ chemical compositions, the researchers concluded that a [[cellular manufacturing]] system similar to the one used in a modern [[Toyota]] factory, as opposed to a continuous [[assembly line]] in the early days of the automobile industry, was employed.&lt;ref name="rsc"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Rees|first=Simon|title=Chemistry unearths the secrets of the Terracotta Army|url=https://eic.rsc.org/feature/chemistry-unearths-the-secrets-of-the-terracotta-army/2000074.article|magazine=[[Education in Chemistry]]|volume=51|issue=2|pages=22–25|publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]]|accessdate=29 March 2014|date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martinón-Torres|first=Marcos|author2=Li, Xiuzhen Janice |author3=Bevan, Andrew |author4=Xia, Yin |author5=Zhao, Kun |author6= Rehren, Thilo |title=Forty Thousand Arms for a Single Emperor: From Chemical Data to the Labor Organization Behind the Bronze Arrows of the Terracotta Army|journal=Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory|volume=21|issue=3|pages=534|date=20 October 2012|doi=10.1007/s10816-012-9158-z|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1361957/1/Rehren_Forty_thousand_arms_for_a_single_emperor.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Shewing-Up of Blanco Posnet: A Sermon in Crude Melodrama''''' is a [[one-act play]] by [[George Bernard Shaw]], first produced in 1909.&lt;ref name= tdb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatredatabase.com/20th_century/george_bernard_shaw_003.html|title=The Shewing-Up of Blanco Posnet|website=Theatredatabase.com|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shaw describes the play as a religious tract in dramatic form.&lt;ref name = was&gt;Violet M. Broad &amp; C. Lewis Broad ''Dictionary to the Plays and Novels of Bernard Shaw'', A. &amp; C. Black, London, 1929, p.81.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1909 Shaw jousted with governmental censorship, as personified by The Examiner Of Plays, an agency acting under the auspices of the [[Lord Chamberlain]]. The outcome, unsatisfactory to Shaw, is reviewed minutely in the Preface to this play, which had been refused a license to perform because of statements made by the protagonist about God, which were thought to violate the [[Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom|blasphemy law]] in force at the time.

== Plot summary==
The play is set in the [[Old American West|American West]].  Blanco Posnet, a local drunk and reprobate, is brought before the court accused of stealing a horse belonging to the Sheriff. He had been found walking along a road out of town after having left his brother's house in the early hours of the morning. The same night the horse had gone missing from his brother's stable. His accusers assume he has sold or concealed the horse. Blanco says they can't convict him without evidence that he ever had the horse. He also says he was owed some jewellery belonging to his mother, which had been bequeathed to him, but his brother had refused to hand it over. Even if he did take the horse he did so as payment for the debt his brother owed. Unfortunately he was unaware that the horse was merely being stabled by his brother, but belonged to the Sheriff. His brother, a reformed drunkard who is now a church Deacon, lectures Blanco on morality and judgement, but Blanco ridicules his brother's view of God. 

Feemy, the local prostitute, is called to witness. She says that she saw Blanco riding off on the horse. Blanco says that her word cannot be trusted, as she is a woman of low character and she admits was drunk at the time; in any case she has a grudge against him because - unlike members of the jury he can name - he had no interest in her services. The jury are outraged and strongly inclined to convict Blanco. At this point news arrives that the horse has been found. A woman had used it to take her sick child to the nearest doctor. The woman is brought to the court. She says she was given the horse by a man who was about to pass her on it on the road as she was carrying her dying child. She had pleaded with the man to allow her to take the horse. The judge asks her to name the man, but she absolutely denies that Blanco was the man who gave her the horse. She says that the man who did give it to her evidently did so in the knowledge that on foot he would probably be caught and could be hanged. It is clear to everyone that Blanco gave her the horse, but she cannot bring herself to name him if it will mean his conviction and inevitable hanging. Feemy takes the stand again and says she was lying about having seen Blanco. She never saw him on the horse. Blanco is released. He offers to marry Feemy in thanks for what she did, but she rejects him. Blanco says he'll buy drinks for everyone in the saloon and offers to shake Feemy's hand. She accepts.

==Production and censorship==
The play was originally to have been performed in one of [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]]'s After Noon Theatre productions at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]]. However, the censor demanded changes to the text because the statements made by Blanco Posnet about God were thought to contravene the Blasphemy law.&lt;ref name = abb/&gt; Shaw refused to alter the text, insisting that the views expressed were absolutely central to meaning of the play. 

The [[Theatres Act 1843]] only applied to the vicinities of London, [[Oxbridge]], and [[List of British royal residences|royal residences]], and not at all in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dean|first=Joan Fitzpatrick|title=Riot and Great Anger: Stage Censorship in Twentieth-Century Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e11OlllE-asC |accessdate=20 November 2017|date=2010-04-29|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=9780299196646|pages=13–15, 88–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw suggested that the play could be performed at the [[Abbey Theatre]] in Dublin. The play was accepted. Despite pressure from the [[Dublin Castle administration]] to stop the production, it went ahead. Shaw refused to make any of the changes requested by the censor, but did make two changes in the play at the suggestion of [[Lady Gregory]], as he believed they were improvements, but they had nothing to do with the issues raised by the censorship.&lt;ref name = was/&gt; The Abbey players' first public performance was in Liverpool on 10 April 1909.&lt;ref name="Gibbs2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibbs|first=A.|title=A Bernard Shaw Chronology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E1h9DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA218|accessdate=20 November 2017|date=2001-02-14|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=9780230599581|page=218 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its Dublin premiere on 25 August 1909 played to "a packed house", including [[James Joyce]], who was reviewing it for the Trieste newspaper ''Piccolo della sera'' (and was "mightily unimpressed" by it).&lt;ref name = abb&gt;Robert Welch, ''The Abbey Theatre, 1899-1999: Form and Pressure'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1999, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; [[W.

{{quote|The root of the whole difference between us and England in such matters [as censorship] is that though there might be some truth in the old charge that we  are not truthful to one another here in Ireland, we are certainly always truthful to ourselves. In England they have learned from commerce to be truthful to one another, but they are great liars when alone. The English censor exists to keep them from finding out the fact. He gives them incomplete arguments, sentimental half-truths, and above all he keeps dramatists from giving them anything in sudden phrases that would startle them into the perception of reality.&lt;ref&gt;R. F. Foster, ''The Irish Story: Telling Tales and Making It Up in Ireland'', Oxford University Press, New York, 2003, p.102&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Abbey production transferred to London for two private performances (which were legal) at the [[Aldwych Theatre]] on 5 and 6 December 1909 under the auspices of the [[Incorporated Stage Society]].&lt;ref name = was/&gt;

==Meaning==
Shaw claimed that "this little play is really a religious tract in dramatic form", the plot being less important than the debate about morality and divinity that occurs between the characters.&lt;ref name = was/&gt; He was using the folksy language and quirky insights of his principal character to explore his version of the [[Nietzsche]]an concept that modern morality must move "[[beyond good and evil]]". Shaw took the view that God is a process of continual self-overcoming: "if I could conceive a god as deliberately creating something less than himself, I should class him as a cad. If he were simply satisfied with himself, I should class him as a lazy coxcomb. My god must continually strive to surpass himself."&lt;ref name = geh/&gt; When he heard that [[Leo Tolstoy]] had shown an interest in the ideas expressed in the play, he wrote a letter to him explaining his views further:

{{quote|You will see that my theology and my explanation of the existence of evil is expressed roughly by Blanco. To me God does not yet exist; but there is a creative force constantly struggling to evolve an executive organ of godlike knowledge and power: that is, to achieve omnipotence and omniscience; and every man and woman born is a fresh attempt to achieve this object...To my mind, unless we conceive God as engaged in a continual struggle to surpass himself--as striving at every birth to make a better man than before--we are conceiving nothing better than an omnipotent snob.&lt;ref name = geh/&gt;}}

Shaw's friend and biographer [[Archibald Henderson (professor)|Archibald Henderson]] summarises the meaning of the play as follows:

{{quote|In spite of its apparently flippant title and mining camp language it is the most sincerely religious of plays. It is, in small compass, a narration of the workings of that religion which Shaw first projected in The Dream in Hell [''Don Juan in Hell'']. The problem of evil is the result of the imperfection of the striving and incomplete God. Like Dick Dudgeon [in ''The Devil's Disciple''], Blanco becomes an instrument in the hands of some higher force: against his reason he finds himself impelled to save a child. "There's no good and bad," says Posnet in his puncheon-bench sermon; "but by Jiminy, gents, there's a rotten game, and there's a great game. I played the rotten game; but the great game was played on me; and now I'm for the great game every time. Amen."&lt;ref name = geh&gt;Archibald Henderson, ''George Bernard Shaw: Man of the Century'', Appleton-Century-Crofts, New York, 1956, p.588-90&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Henderson, who was American, found Shaw's attempts to depict the West unconvincing to the point of absurdity, "To an American, familiar with the scenes and conditions described, the superficial pseudo-realism of the play is grotesque in its unreality", but the central idea was effective — the attempt to represent an original idea of God forming in the mind of a "crude" person at the edge of civilisation: "It is a study of the sudden impact of the idea of a primitive God upon the mind of a crude cowboy".&lt;ref name = geh/&gt; James Joyce in his review for ''Il Piccolo della sera'' said he agreed with Shaw's own subtitle, the play was "a sermon in crude melodrama...the art is too poor to make it convincing as drama". He thought Shaw was showing himself up as bombastic sermoniser. Shaw had a gloriously "profane and unruly past. Fabianism, vegetarianism, prohibitionism, music, painting, drama--all the progressive movements in art and politics--have had him as champion. And now, perhaps some divine finger has touched his brain, and he, in the guise of Blanco Posnet, is shewn up".&lt;ref&gt;James Joyce, " Bernard Shaw's Battle with the Censor (1909)" as quoted in Martha Fodaski Black, ''Shaw and Joyce: The Last Word in Stolentelling'', University Press of Florida, Gainesville, FL., 1995, p.322&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Urmston Musical Theatre''' (UMT) is an [[amateur theatre]] company based in [[Urmston]], [[Greater Manchester]], UK.

==History==
The organisation was formed in 1911 as the Urmston and District Operatic Society, and produced ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' at the Urmston Public Hall. In 1947, the name was changed to the Urmston Amateur Operatic Society which remained until it assumed the current name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umt.org.uk The Urmston Musical Theatre], Retrieved on 14 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several well-known personalities have been connected with the society, notably the current President, [[Matthew Kelly]], who appeared in the society's 1963 production of ''[[The King and I]]'' along with Peter Pennington, who became a featured soloist with the ''[[Black and White Minstrel Show|Black and White Minstrels]]''. Others include [[Brian Trueman]] who appeared in the group's production of ''[[Merrie England (opera)|Merrie England]]'' in 1951,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umt.org.uk/merrie.htm Merrie England 1951] The Urmston Musical Theatre, Retrieved on 16 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the late Lord Winstanley and [[Winston Churchill (1940–2010)|Winston Churchill]] MP,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umt.org.uk/pastshows.htm UMT Past Shows] The Urmston Musical Theatre, Retrieved on 16 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; grandson of the wartime leader and son of [[Randolph Churchill]] MBE.

In 1958, 1959 and 1960, the society won the [[Manchester Evening News]] Prompter's Palm award for their productions of ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'', ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' and ''Magyar Melody'' respectively. The society has also been nominated in the Manchester Musical Awards on a number of occasions for both overall and individual performances. In 1995, they won the "Best Musical" award for their production of ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]''.

Junior members aged between 8 years and 18 years, in addition to being involved in some of the main shows and pantomimes, have presented a variety of musicals in their own right since 1993 including ''[[Adaptations of The Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Bugsy Malone]]'', ''Andy Capp'', ''[[Copperfield (musical)|Copperfield]]'', and ''Dazzle''.

In the early 1930s, the theatre almost closed when reserves fell to £3, but for the enthusiasm and dedication of its members and patrons.

'''''Woman Kills Injured Man''''' ({{Lang-no|'''Kvinne dreper skadet mann'''}}) is a 1994 painting by the Norwegian artist [[Odd Nerdrum]]. It depicts a man who is assaulted by a woman armed with a knife.

The painting is in the collections of the [[Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art]] in Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://afmuseet.no/en/samlingen/utvalgte-kunstnere/n/odd-nerdrum/kvinne-dreper-skadet-mann|title=Kvinne dreper skadet mann|publisher=[[Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art]]|accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In a dark, rocky coastal landscape, a nude man with open mouth and twisted arms is falling headlong toward the ground. A nude woman armed with a knife is hanging in the air, falling over the man or clinging to his leg. In the background to the right are three additional people who observe the two in the foreground.

==Themes==
The subject of a man and a woman in lethal struggle recurs in several of Nerdrum's paintings from the 1990s, such as ''Buried Alive'' from 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Blom|first1=Hege|last2=Reisegg|first2=Øyvind|url=https://snl.no/Odd%20Nerdrum|title=Odd Nerdrum|language=Norwegian|work=[[Store norske leksikon]]|accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1998 book ''Odd Nerdrum: Storyteller and Self-Revealer'', the art historian and Nerdrum scholar Jan Åke Pettersson interprets ''Woman Kills Injured Man'' through a personal crisis Nerdrum had gone through. In the mid 1980s Nerdrum had a relationship with a female student. He left his family for her, but was rejected when she was accepted to the [[Norwegian National Academy of Fine Arts]]. As a reaction, Nerdrum went to her home and slashed the paintings he had given her. According to Pettersson, this episode is also reflected in paintings such as ''Woman with Fish'', ''Mann med steinbit'' and ''Man Bitten by a Snake''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Fossum|first=Tommy|date=1998-09-24|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/1998/09/24/132085.html|title=Avslører privatlivet i bildene sine|language=Norwegian|work=[[Dagbladet]]|accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The important place of '''women in dance''' can be traced back to the very origins of civilization. Cave paintings, Egyptian frescos, Indian statuettes, ancient Greek and Roman art and records of court traditions in China and Japan all testify to the important role women played in ritual and religious dancing from the start. In the [[Middle Ages]], what has become known as [[ballet]] had its beginnings in Italian court festivals when women frequently played the parts of men. It was however in late 17th-century France that the [[Paris Opera Ballet|Paris Opera]] produced the first celebrated ballerinas. While women began to dominate the ballet scene in the 18th century, it was with the advent of [[Romantic ballet]] in the 19th century that they became the undisputed centre of attraction with stars playing the leading roles in the works of [[Marius Petipa]], appearing in theatres across Europe from Milan's [[La Scala]] to the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] in Saint Petersburg. More recently, women have played a leading role in developing various forms of [[modern dance]] including [[flamenco]] and [[expressionist dance]].

==History==
Women have always played a predominant role in dance, as can be seen from its earliest history until the emergence of formal dances in the 15th century which developed into [[ballet]].

===Antiquity===
Cave paintings from as long ago as 6000 BC provide scenes of dancing women. Examples can be seen in the [[Grotta dell'Addaura|Addauta Cave]] near [[Palermo]] and in the [[Roca dels Moros]] in [[Catalonia]]. In [[Ancient Egypt]], women performed ritual dances for religious ceremonies such as funerals, as illustrated by frescos on the pharaohs' tombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/timelines/topics/music.htm|title=Egyptia Dance and Music|publisher=Kibbutz Reshafim|accessdate=4 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest records of organised dance and of professional female dancers come from Egypt.

===China and Japan===
In China too there is a long recorded history of women dancers since the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (c. 1046–256 BC) reaching a peak in the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907 AD).&lt;ref name="aesthetic tradition"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=d1eZuB2xwYwC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Chinese Aesthetic Tradition |author= Zehou Li |page=5 |publisher= University of Hawaii Press |others=translated by Maija Bell Samei |year= 2009 |isbn=978-0824833077 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chorus dances performed by women in the Zhou dynasty were known as ''xi''.

===Middle Ages===
In the [[Middle Ages]], with the spread of Christianity across Europe, the church generally frowned upon dance although there was often dancing at [[folk dance|folk festivals]], particularly at the beginning of May. In France and Italy, chain and circular dances such as the ''[[Carol (music)|carole]]'', and the ''tresque'' were popular from the 4th to 14th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamarotte.fr/?page_id=586|title=Danses médiévales et renaissance|publisher=La Marotte|accessdate=6 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were usually danced in a closed circle with men and women interspersed and holding hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mullally|first=Robert|title=The Carole: A Study of a Medieval Dance|location=Farnham, Surrey, England|publisher=Ashgate|year=2011|pages=41–50|isbn=978-1-4094-1248-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, the lively [[saltarello]] from Naples became popular in the 14th and 15th centuries. Groups of [[courtesan]]s dressed as men performed the dance at [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]]s.&lt;ref name="Caroso1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Caroso|first=Fabritio|title=Courtly Dance of the Renaissance: A New Translation and Edition of the Nobiltà Di Dame (1600)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PBwqMyKQvM4C&amp;pg=PA43|year=1995|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-28619-8|pages=43–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence of ballet==
In the 15th century, court festivities in Italy became ever more elaborate, often featuring formal dances. One of the early masters was [[Domenico da Piacenza]] (c. 1400–1470) who compiled a manual of dance: ''De arte saltandi et choreas ducendi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/pnd/|title=De arte saltandi et choreas ducendi|publisher=pbm.com|accessdate=8 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, too, professional dancing began to take shape when dancers performed for [[Henry III of France]] at [[Palace of Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]] in the early 1580s. Further presentations were made for [[Louis XIII]], who frequently took the main part himself. But it was, above all, during the reign of [[Louis XIV]] (1643–1715) that the foundations were laid for what became known as ballet. The king not only had the rules of dance written down but established the [[Académie Royale de Danse]] in 1661, which developed into today's [[Paris Opera Ballet]].&lt;ref name=ml/&gt; Many of the early ballets were created by the Italian-French composer [[Jean Baptiste Lully]] and the French choreographer [[Pierre Beauchamp]], often assisted by [[Molière]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/yiannis/dance/history.html|title=History of Ballet|publisher=Northeastern University|accessdate=8 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, female parts in the early ballets were taken by young men; but, in 1681, a young woman known as [[De Lafontaine|Mademoiselle De Lafontaine]] danced in Lully's ''Le Triomphe de l'amour''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/326306/La-Fontaine|title=La Fontaine
|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to be the leading ballerina in at least 18 other productions at the Paris Opera between 1681 and 1693, establishing the supreme importance of women in ballet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100047735|title=Mlle de Lafontaine|publisher=Oxford Reference|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Lafontaine was succeeded by [[Marie-Thérèse de Subligny]] who became the first ballerina to perform in London when she appeared with [[Claude Ballon]] in 1699.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100539716|title=Marie-Thérèse Subligny|publisher=Oxford Reference|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Said to be the best ballerina of her day, with beautiful eyes and a fine figure, Subligny danced at the Paris Opera from 1688 until her retirement in 1707.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://operabaroque.fr/Cadre_baroque.htm|title=Le Triomphe de l'amour|publisher=Le magazine de l'opéra baroque|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next leading dancer of the Opéra was [[Françoise Prévost]] (1680–1741), whose precision, lightness and grace contributed much to classical ballet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/475670/Francoise-Prevost|title=Françoise Prévost|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She persuaded conductor [[Jean-Féry Rebel]] to compose suites specifically for ballet. His ''Caprice'', ''Boutade'', ''Les Caractères de la danse'' and ''La Terpsichore'' brought her considerable success. In particular, her personal interpretation of the steps in ''Caprice'' served as an example for other soloists while she transformed the ''Caractères'' into a sequence illustrating different types of lover, both male and female. Prévost trained two highly successful dancers, [[Marie-Anne de Cupis de Camargo|Marie Camargo]] (1710–1770) and [[Marie Sallé]] (1707–1756), who added their personal preferences to her ''Caractères'', each developing individual styles. They would take her place as [[prima ballerina]]s after she retired from the opera in 1730.&lt;ref name="Brooks2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Lynn|title=Women’s Work: Making Dance in Europe Before 1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=By5TNdV4dGUC&amp;pg=PA131|year=2007|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-22530-8|pages=131–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greskovic2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greskovic|first=Robert|title=Ballet 101: A Complete Guide to Learning and Loving the Ballet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2COs6yh_LS0C&amp;pg=PA19|year=2005|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=978-0-87910-325-5|pages=19–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camargo proved to be a tremendous success, not only as a result of her dazzling footwork (especially her [[entrechat|entrechat à quatre]]), but because she introduced slightly shorter skirts and new hair styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/90467/Marie-Camargo|title=Marie Camargo|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also discarded high-heeled shoes, introducing dancing slippers which facilitated the execution of the more demanding routines.&lt;ref name="Kassing2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kassing|first=Gayle|title=History of Dance: An Interactive Arts Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_lLoTsT2X5EC&amp;pg=PA113|year=2007|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-0-7360-6035-6|pages=113–}}&lt;/ref&gt; By dancing demanding routines, which had previously been performed exclusively by men, Camargo further consolidated the image of the ballerina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/nvaget/danseuse/ladanseuse/ladanseuse/1700-1750.html|title=

Sallé sought more from ballet than skillful demonstrations of technique as favoured by proponents of traditional ballet. She believed music, steps, decor and costumes should all contribute to a graceful, expressive performance combining [[pantomime]] with dance in what became known as [[ballet d'action]]. As many in the Paris Opera did not share her views, she decided to move to the more liberal London. At [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]], she caused a sensation in 1734 as Galatea in ''Pygmalion'', a ballet she had choreographed herself. Discarding the usual attire of a ballerina, she chose to wear a simple muslin tunic and allow her hair to fall freely over her shoulders.&lt;ref name="Garfunkel2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garfunkel|first=Trudy|title=On Wings of Joy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GyTwwDm3YT4C&amp;pg=PA20|year=2002|publisher=E-reads/E-rights|isbn=978-0-7592-2862-7|pages=20–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, she even decided to dress as a man while performing the role of Cupid but the reviews were extremely critical. As a result, she returned to Paris where she danced at the Opéra until her retirement in 1740 at the young age of 33. Thereafter, she occasionally danced for the court at [[Château de Versailles|Versailles]].&lt;ref name="Brooks2007"/&gt;

During the second half of the 18th century, the dominating star of the Paris Opera was [[Marie-Madeleine Guimard]] who may not have had the technique of Sallé but was nevertheless recognized for her sensuous movements, her numerous suitors and her exotic attire. Other stars included [[Marie Allard]] (1738–1802) who joined the Paris Opera in 1756 where she was trained by [[Gaétan Vestris]], becoming not just an étoile but also his wife. Although she was rather corpulent and frequently pregnant, she was acclaimed for her impressive footwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/nvaget/danseuse/ladanseuse/ladanseuse/1750-1830.html|title=La Danseuse: Evolution et Révolution: Les années 1750 à 1830|publisher=Mount Holyoke|accessdate=11 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romantic ballet==
The most successful period for female ballet dancers was around the 1830s and 1840s when they became the great stars of [[Romantic ballet]]. The Italian-Swedish [[Marie Taglioni]] (1804–1884) not only excelled at the Paris Opera when she danced ''[[La Sylphide]]'' in 1832 but extended her fame to Saint Petersburg's [[Mariinsky Ballet]] as well as to the stages of Berlin, Milan and London until her retirement in 1847. It was she who developed ballet's [[en pointe]] (dancing on the tips of the toes) while introducing new fashions in dress and hair styling which became popular throughout Europe. The Austrian [[Fanny Elssler]] (1810–1884) gained fame and fortune by dancing the flirtatious Spanish [[cachucha]] in ''Le Diable boiteux'', performing not only in Austria, Germany, France, England and Russia but also in the United States. Nevertheless, in 1845 she refused to dance with her rivals Marie Taglioni, [[Carlotta Grisi]], [[Fanny Cerrito]], and [[Lucile Grahn]] in [[Jules Perrot]]'s ''[[Pas de Quatre]]''.&lt;ref name=vam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/r/romantic-ballet/|title=Romantic Ballet|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=16 April 2014|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/nvaget/danseuse/ladanseuse/ladanseuse/1830-1848.html|title=La Danseuse: Evolution et Révolution: Les années 1830 à 1848:La danse romantique|publisher=Mount Holyoke|accessdate=16 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presented at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] in London, the ''Pas de Quatre'' caused a sensation, bringing together the four greatest ballerinas of the day. In addition to Marie Taglioni, Italy's Grisi (1819–1899) had become famous both in Paris and Saint Petersburg for her ''[[Giselle]]'', while Cerrito from Naples had become the star of [[La Scala]] in Milan. Grahn (1819–1907), a Dane trained by Bournonville, was based in Paris but had also danced in London, Saint Petersburg and Milan before settling in Germany.&lt;ref name=vam/&gt;

Several notable Italian ballerinas emerged in the second half of the 19th century, reaching their zeniths in Russia. Italian-born [[Virginia Zucchi]] (1849–1933) first danced in Italy and Germany but her interpretations of [[Marius Petipa]]'s ballet in Russia were so successful that the Tzar insisted she should join the [[Mariinsky Ballet]] in Saint Petersburg. In the mid-1880s, she starred in ''[[Coppélia]]'', ''[[La fille mal gardée]]'' and ''[[La Esmeralda (ballet)|La Esmeralda]]'', revolutionizing ballet in Russia through the extraordinary power of her performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803133549548|title=Virginia Zucchi|publisher=Oxford Index|accessdate=17 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierina Legnani]] (1863–1930) from Milan followed as similar path, also dancing at the Mariinsky from 1892 where she originated famous roles in Petipa's ballets including ''[[Cinderella (Fitinhof-Schell)|Cinderella]]'', ''[[Swan Lake]]'' and ''[[Raymonda]]'', gaining the title of [[prima ballerina assoluta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100058642|title=Pierina Legnani|publisher=Oxford Reference|accessdate=17 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlotta Brianza]] (1867–1930), also from Milan, first gained fame at [[La Scala]] with which she toured the United States.

==20th-century ballet==
New, more dynamic approaches to ballet developed from the beginning of the 20th century, the most influential being [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]], promoting innovative collaborations between choreographers, composers and dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/history-and-heritage/ART309940|title=

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Ballet also began to develop in London, thanks mainly to the efforts of two women. Polish-born [[Marie Rambert]] (1888–1982) who had also gained experience with the Ballets Russes founded the [[Ballet Club]] (later the Rambert Dance Company) in 1926 introducing new choreographers such as [[Frederick Ashton]]. Even more influential, [[Ninette de Valois]] (1898–2001) spent three years with the Ballets Russes before creating London's [[Vic-Wells Ballet]] in 1931 (later becoming the Royal Ballet) where [[Alicia Markova]] (1910–2004) was the first prima ballerina, starring in ballets from the Mariinsky's classical productions. Markova left to form her own touring company in 1937. Ten years later [[Margot Fonteyn]] (1919–1991) became the company's prima ballerina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/e/establishment-of-british-ballet/|title=The Establishment of British Ballet|publisher=V&amp;A|accessdate=23 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The height of her fame came in 1961 when she embarked on a partnership with [[Rudolf Nureyev]], first in ''[[Giselle]]'', until she retired in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nureyev.org/rudolf-nureyev-biography-margot-fonteyn/|title=Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn, the perfect partnership|publisher=Rudolf Nureyev Foundation|accessdate=23 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

As ballet developed in the United States, [[Maria Tallchief]] (1925–2013), the first major American prima ballerina, was promoted by the choreographer [[Bronislava Nijinska]] (1891–1972) when she joined the [[Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]] in New York in 1942. She danced as a soloist in [[George Balanchine]]'s arrangements for ''[[Song of Norway]]'' in 1944. As Balanchine's wife, she soon became the star of the [[New York City Ballet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/13/arts/dance/maria-tallchief-brilliant-ballerina-dies-at-88.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Maria Tallchief, a Dazzling Ballerina and Muse for Balanchine, Dies at 88|author=Jack Anderson|newspaper=New York Times|date=12 April 2013|accessdate=24 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucia Chase]] (1897–1986) was a co-founder of the [[American Ballet Theatre]] in 1939 and became its artistic director for over 40 years, overseeing the production of a wide variety of new ballets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/19/arts/dance-view-lucia-chase-helped-create-the-ballet-world-we-know.html|title=Dance View: Lucia Chase Helped Create the Ballet World we Know|author=Anna Kisselgoff|newspaper=New York Times|date=19 January 1986|accessdate=24 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several outstanding American ballerinas have emerged over the years including [[Gelsey Kirkland]] (born 1952), who performed the leading role in ''[[The Firebird]]'' when she was just 17,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/gelsey-kirkland-9365803#controversy-and-comeback&amp;awesm=~oCmUgMJASHMm00|title=Gelsey Kirkland|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=24 April 2014|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Suzanne Farrell]] (born 1945) who was the star of Balanchine's ''[[Don Quixote (ballet)|Don Quixote]]'' in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/far0bio-1|title=Suzanne Farrell Biography|publisher=Academy of Achievement|accessdate=24 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other forms of dance==
[[File:Flamenco dancer 3467.jpg|thumb|200px|Flamenco dancer]]
Women have also contributed significantly to most other forms of dance, in particular [[flamenco]], [[modern dance]], [[expressionist dance]], [[belly dance]] and [[cabaret]] which led to [[musical theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artsalive.ca/en/dan/dance101/forms.asp|title=Dance Forms: An Introduction |publisher=ArtsAlive.ca|accessdate=17 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flamenco===
Flamenco music originated in the south of Spain in the 15th century, probably resulting from the influence of the Moors with possible origins in India. While many of the singers who emerged in the 18th century were men, women increasingly gained fame as dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andalucia.org/es/flamenco/evolucion-etapa-hermetica-primeros-cantaores/|title=Flamenco: Evolución. Etapa Hermética. Primeros cantaores|publisher=Andalucía.org|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest was [[Juana la Macarrona]] (1860–1947) who first performed in Seville with singer [[Silverio Franconetti]] but soon become popular not only throughout Spain but across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nyoflamenco.es/index.php/aula-flamenca/artistas/baile/509-la-macarrona|title=La Macarrona|publisher=Noticias y Ocio|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lola Flores]] (1923–1995) is remembered for singing and dancing Andalusian folklore, especially flamenco, [[copla (music)|copla]] and [[chotis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andalucia.com/history/people/lolaflores.htm|title=Lola Flores|publisher=Andalucia.com|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angelita Vargas]] (born 1946) is considered to be one of the greatest stars of Andalusian flamenco dancing, touring Europe, the United States, Japan and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apsaraflamenco.fr/Angelita-Vargas.html?lang=fr|title=Angelita Vargas|publisher=Apsâra Flamenco|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern dance===
Led by women, various styles of [[modern dance]] began to develop towards the end of the 19th century. [[Loie Fuller]] (1862–1928) from Chicago was one of the pioneers. She employed her own natural approach to movement and improvisation, later becoming a star at the [[Folies Bergères]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artsalive.ca/en/dan/meet/bios/artistDetail.asp?artistID=168|title=Loie Fuller|publisher=Dance: National Arts Centre|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by Greek art, [[Isadora Duncan]] (1877–1927) from San Francisco paved the way to the modern free dance style believing it was more important to express the essence of life through movement rather than to follow the precepts of classical ballet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdc.edu/wolfson/academic/ArtsLetters/art_philosophy/Humanities/beginnings/beginnings_of_modern_dance.htm|title=The Beginnings of Modern Dance|publisher=Miami Dade College|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raised on a farm in New Jersey, [[Ruth St. Denis]] (1879–1968) developed her own interpretations of Oriental dance as an expression of spiritualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danceheritage.org/treasures/stdenis_essay_hecht.pdf|title=Ruth St. Denis (1879—1968): America's Divine Dancer |publisher=Dance Heritage Coalition|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[Martha Graham]] (1894–1991) exerted considerable influence on the development of modern dance through her New York-based [[Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095902861|title=Martha Graham|publisher=Oxford Reference|accessdate=20 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other female figures who contributed to developments in the mid-20th century include [[Doris Humphrey]] (1895–1958) who choreographed Afro-American spirituals and [[Helen Tamiris]] (1905–1966) who played an important part in choreographing early musicals.&lt;ref name="HendersonStacey2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henderson|first1=Lol|last2=Stacey|first2=Lee|title=Encyclopedia of Music in the 20th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m8W2AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-92946-6|pages=41–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/tamiris-helen|title=Helen Tamaris|author=Pauline Tish|publisher=Jewish Women's Archive|accessdate=20 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major choreographer of Broadway musicals was German-born [[Hanya Holm]] (1893–1992), a student of Mary Wigman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/04/theater/hanya-holm-is-dead-at-99-influential-choreographer.html|title=Hanya Holm Is Dead at 99; Influential Choreographer|author=Jennifer Dunning|newspaper=New York Times|date=4 November 1992|accessdate=20 April 2014|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expressionist dance===
The German [[Mary Wigman]] is credited as the creator of [[expressionist dance]]. Inspired by Oriental percussion, she often stressed the macabre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theatre-dance.cahss.ualr.edu/waynesweb/Expressionism/ExpressionisticDance.htm|title=Expressionistic Dance: Mary Wigman|publisher=Twentieth Century Dance|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hertha Feist]] (1896–1990), also from Germany, was an expressionist dancer and choreographer. She established her own school in Berlin, combining gymnastics with nudism and dance although her ambitions were later seriously curtailed by the Nazis.&lt;ref name=fmp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sk-kultur.de/tanz/feist2.htm|title=Feist|author=Frank-Manuel Peter|publisher=SK Stiftung Kultur|accessdate=19 February 2014 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also an associate of Wigman, [[Gret Palucca]] (1902–1993) opened her own schools in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s but they were later closed because of her Jewish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adk.de/de/archiv/archivbestand/darstellende-kunst/kuenstler/Gret_Palucca.htm|title=Gret Palucca|publisher=Akademie der Künste|accessdate=19 April 2014 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of her students, [[Dore Hoyer]] (1911–1967), who was also an associate of Mary Wigman, developed her own programmes before the [[Second World War]] in Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. After the war she became ballet director at the [[Hamburg State Opera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sk-kultur.de/tanz/hoyer.htm|title=Dore Hoyer (1911-1967)|publisher=SK Stiftung Kultur|accessdate=19 April 2014 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Belly dance===
While belly dancing appears to have its origins in the distant past, it was introduced to Europe and North America towards the end of the 19th century. Several of Egypt's film actresses performed belly dancing in the musicals of the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aleenah.com/history.html|title=Bellydance Unveiled: A Brief History|publisher=Aleenah.com|accessdate=20 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early stars included [[Tahia Carioca]] (1919–1999), [[Samia Gamal]] (1924–1994) and [[Nelly Mazloum]] (1929–2003).&lt;ref name="Hammond2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=Andrew|title=Popular Culture in the Arab World: Arts, Politics, and the Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O06bOHRW7s8C&amp;pg=PA192|year=2007|publisher=American Univ in Cairo Press|isbn=978-977-416-054-7|pages=192–}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1960s, belly dance became increasingly popular across the United States with stars including [[Dalilah (bellydancer)]] (1936–2001), Dahlena and [[Serena Wilson|Serena]] (1933–2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bellydance.org/articles/bellydance_history.html|title=Belly Dance History ~ An American Odessey: A History of Modern US Bellydance|author=Helen Waldie|publisher=IAMED|accessdate=20 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cabaret===
Women started to sing and dance in the cabarets of Paris in the 1890s, emphasizing the female body by introducing seductive movements highlighting their breasts and hips. Most of them had no formal training, the exception being [[Cléo de Mérode]] (1875–1966) who left the Paris Opera to perform at the [[Folies Bergère]].&lt;ref name=be&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/nvaget/danseuse/ladanseuse/ladanseuse/1890-1914.html|title=La Danseuse: Evolution et Révolution: Les années 1890 à 1914: La Belle Epoque|publisher=Mount Holyoke|accessdate=21 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major choreographer was Algerian-born [[Mariquita (dancer)|Mariquita]] (1830–1922) who became ballet director at the Folies Bergère and the [[Opéra Comique]].

The '''Yiddish Book Center''' ('''National Yiddish Book Center'''), located on the campus of [[Hampshire College]] in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]], United States, is a cultural institution dedicated to the preservation of books in the [[Yiddish language]], as well as the culture and history those books represent. It is one of ten western Massachusetts museums constituting the [[Museums10]] consortium.

==History==
The Yiddish Book Center was founded in 1980 by [[Aaron Lansky]], then a twenty-four-year-old graduate student of Yiddish literature and, {{as of|2016|lc=y}}, the center's president. In the course of his studies, Lansky realized that untold numbers of irreplaceable Yiddish books were being discarded by American-born Jews unable to read the language of their Yiddish-speaking parents and grandparents. He organized a nationwide network of ''zamlers'' (volunteer book collectors) and launched a campaign to save the world’s remaining Yiddish books. Lansky recounts the origins of the center in his 2004 memoir, ''[[Outwitting History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://algonquin.com/book/outwitting-history/|title=Outwitting History - Algonquin Books - Books For A Well-Read Life|work=Algonquin Books - Books For A Well-Read Life|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time Lansky began his work, scholars estimated there were 70,000 Yiddish books still extant and recoverable. Since then, the Yiddish Book Center has recovered more than a million volumes, and it continues to receive thousands of new books each year from around the world.

In 1997, the Yiddish Book Center moved to its current site in Amherst, Massachusetts, a 49,000-square-foot complex that echoes the rooflines of an East European ''shtetl'' (Jewish town). The center is home to permanent and traveling exhibits, a Yiddish book repository, educational programs, and the annual Yidstock: The Festival of New Yiddish Music.

In 2010, the organization dropped the initial word "National" from its name, and is currently known as "Yiddish Book Center."&lt;ref&gt;[https://lccn.loc.gov/no2011169190 "Yiddish Book Center (U.S.)" in ''Library of Congress Authorities'' (accessed October 4, 2017).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on a score of 100, [[Charity Navigator]] rated the Yiddish Book Center 79.82% for its financials and 97% for accountability and transparency, resulting in an overall grade of 85.57.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=7542|title=Charity Navigator Rating - National Yiddish Book Center|work=Charity Navigator|accessdate=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
The center has drawn on its duplicate holdings to distribute books to students and scholars, and to establish or strengthen collections at more than 700 research libraries, schools, and museums around the world.

The Yiddish Book Center includes a number of different collections: 
* In 1997, with a grant from the Righteous Persons Foundation, the Center launched its [[Steven Spielberg]] Digital Yiddish Library, which has digitized and cataloged more than 12,000 Yiddish titles and made them available for free download from the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/nationalyiddishbookcenter|title=Yiddish Book Center's Spielberg Digital Yiddish Library|work=archive.org|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Yiddish Book Center formed a partnership with the [[National Library of Israel]], which was launching its own project to digitize its entire Hebrew-alphabet collection, including thousands of Yiddish titles. The effort prompted ''The New York Times'' to declare Yiddish "proportionately the most accessible literature on the planet". As of the end of 2014, the titles in the Steven Spielberg Digital Yiddish Library have been downloaded 1.3 million times. 
* The David and Sylvia Steiner Yizkor Books Collection comprises hundreds of ''[[Bereavement in Judaism#Yizkor|yizkor]] books'', memorial volumes commemorating Jewish communities in East Europe that were destroyed in the Holocaust. The books in the collection can be searched online.
* The Noah Cotsen Library of Yiddish Children's Literature includes about 800 titles, both original Yiddish works and Yiddish translations of classic stories written in other languages. The majority of the titles, which come from the [[YIVO]] Institute for Jewish Research as well as from the center's own collection, have been digitized and included in the Steven Spielberg Digital Yiddish Library.
* The Sami Rohr Library of Recorded Yiddish Books is a collection of roughly 150 titles, including novels, short stories, nonfiction works, memoirs, essays, and poetry. The recordings were made at the Jewish Public Library of Montreal (JPL) in the 1980s and '90s by native Yiddish-speaking volunteers. 
* The Frances Brandt Online Yiddish Audio Library comprises recordings of lectures by, and interviews with, writers and poets who visited the JPL between 1953 and 2005. The Yiddish Book Center is now working with the JPL to digitize the recordings. Ultimately, approximately 1,100 recordings from the collection will be digitized and accessible.

==Public programs and resources==
The center offers public programs related to Yiddish and Jewish culture. Each year, the center hosts two visiting exhibits in its Brechner Gallery. It also has a number of permanent exhibits: the Lee &amp; Alfred Hutt Discovery Gallery, an interactive exhibit on Jewish cultural identity; ''Unquiet Pages'' focused on Yiddish literature; ''A Living Connection: Photographs from the An-sky Expeditions, 1912-14'' on the work of ethnographer [[S. Ansky|S. An-sky]]; ''Sholem-Bayes: Reflections on the American Jewish Home''; the Nancy B. Weinstein, ''Kindervinkl'' (children's corner); the Appelbaum-Driker Theater, with exhibits on Yiddish film and radio; and a reproduction Yiddish Print Shop with displays about the Yiddish press in the twentieth century.

''Pakn Treger'' (Yiddish for "book peddler"), the magazine of the Yiddish Book Center, is an English-language magazine that covers subjects related to Yiddish culture and literature as well as news from the center. Its annual translation issue, a digital publication, features newly translated works of Yiddish literature.

==Educational programs==
The center's educational programs include the Steiner Summer Yiddish Program for college students, the Great Jewish Books Summer Program for high school students, a Great Jewish Books Teacher Workshop, a fellowship program, a translation fellowship, and Tent: Encounters with Jewish Culture, as well as online and on-site classes for adult learners, including YiddishSchool. The center also offers a field trip program for middle and high school students.

In 2001, [[Ruthe B. Cowl]] (1912–2008) of [[Laredo, Texas]], donated $1 million to create the Jack and Ruthe B. Cowl Center, which promotes "Yiddish literary, artistic, musical, and historical knowledge and accomplishment" at the center. Early in 2007, Cowl donated another $750,000 to create the Cowl Jewish Leadership Program for promising college students.

==Translation initiative==
In 2013, the center launched a translation effort that includes a translation fellowship program; a publishing venture; Taytsh.org, a website and interactive resource for working Yiddish-to-English translators;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/ |title=Yiddish Book Center |website=Yiddishbookcenter.org |accessdate=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an annual digital ''Pakn Treger'' translation anthology.
