The '''2011 Montreal Museum of Fine Arts theft''' took place in two separate incidents during September and October of that year. In both instances, the same thief took a small ancient stone piece that was openly exhibited, without a protective case, and smuggled it out of [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts|the museum]]. One has since been recovered; however, the thief remains unidentified and the whereabouts of the other is not known.

On September 3, one day before the anniversary of [[1972 Montreal Museum of Fine Arts robbery|the 1972 robbery of 18 paintings]], a visitor took a [[sandstone]] [[Achaemenid Empire]] [[relief]]. In late October, he returned to take a Roman marble head from its pedestal. The two works were collectively valued at $1.3 million, with the relief accounting for almost all of that amount. 

The museum did not disclose the theft until February 2012 to avoid compromising the joint investigation by its insurance company and [[Sureté du Québec]]'s [[art theft]] unit. [[Security camera]] footage allowed them to obtain a description of the thief; investigators believed he was local. A reward was offered for the return of the works.

In 2013, police were led to Simon Metke, an [[Edmonton]] man who had bought the Achaemenid piece for [[Canadian dollar|CDN$]]1,400 during a visit to Montreal two years earlier, believing it to possibly be a replica, after it was seen on a wall behind him during a [[CBC News|CBC]] interview unrelated to the case.&lt;ref name="Simon Metke arrest"&gt;{{cite news|title=Stolen artifact from Montreal museum recovered in Edmonton|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/stolen-artifact-from-montreal-museum-recovered-in-edmonton-1.2535754|newspaper=[[CBC News]]|date=February 14, 2014|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum ultimately declined to buy it back from their insurer and it was put on the market in late 2016.&lt;ref name="Royal Academy frieze page"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Charles Saumarez|last2=Philips|first2=Sam|title=What to see at Frieze 2016|url=https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/article/highlights-of-frieze-london-and-masters-2016|publisher=[[Royal Academy of Art]]|date=October 6, 2016|accessdate=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charges laid against Metke were disposed with a [[discharge (sentence)|conditional discharge]] after he pled guilty to [[Possession of stolen goods#Canada|possession of stolen property]]. Metke's story inspired a character in [[Kevin Smith]]'s 2016 film ''[[Yoga Hosers]]'', as well as the film's title.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pruden|first=Jana|title=The Edmonton man who inspired 'Yoga Hoser' arrested for possession of a $1.2-million ancient statue|url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/alberta/simon-metke-the-man-thrust-into-a-strange-world-of-canadian-art-theft/article34855605/|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=April 28, 2017|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thefts==
On September 3, 2011, a visitor who came to the museum shortly after it opened removed a {{convert|20|by|21|by|3|cm|in|adj=on}}&lt;ref name="2011 theft story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Knelman|first=Joshua|title=Two valuable artifacts stolen from Montreal museum|url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/arts/two-valuable-artifacts-stolen-from-montreal-museum/article546106/|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=February 14, 2012|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sandstone]] [[relief]] depicting a soldier's head, produced during the [[Achaemenid Empire]], which ruled Persia during the 5th century BCE.&lt;ref name="Press artifact return story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Montgomery|first=Sue|title=Police track down artifact stolen from Museum of Fine Arts|url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/montreal-gazette/20140214/281651073005626|newspaper=[[Montreal Gazette]]||via=[[PressReader]]|date=February 14, 2014|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was small and secured to the wall it was on only by an anchor, and otherwise unprotected by glass. The museum staff has not been able to determine how it was removed. Coincidentally, the theft occurred on the day before the 39th anniversary of the only other theft from the museum, the 1972 robbery of 18 paintings, all but one of which are still missing, the largest art theft in Canadian history.&lt;ref name="2011 theft story" /&gt;

The thief returned approximately eight weeks later, in late October, at the same time of day. This time he took a 1st-century Roman marble head, approximately the same size, from its pedestal. Like the earlier piece, it was secured there by an anchor, but otherwise unprotected, not even by a glass case.&lt;ref name="2011 theft story" /&gt;

==Investigation==

}}
When it discovered the pieces, both of which were part of the museum's permanent [[Collection (artwork)|collection]], missing, the museum called the [[Sureté du Québec]]'s (SQ) [[art theft]] unit, the only one in any Canadian provincial police force, and [[AXA]], its insurance company, which also dispatched a team of art-theft specialists. They investigated the case jointly. After reviewing [[security camera]] footage and interviewing museum staff who had been on duty the days of the thefts, they identified a suspect, a man {{convert|5|ft|7|in|cm}} tall who wore a baseball cap and dark jacket as he walked around the museum. They believed he spoke French and lived in the Montreal area.&lt;ref name="2011 theft story" /&gt;

A large poster in front advertises a pop-art exhibit]]
The museum did not publicly disclose the thefts until January 2012 in order to avoid compromising the investigation. When it did inform the news media, it released a description of the suspect and offered rewards for both the thief's identity and the safe return of the missing items.&lt;ref name="2011 theft story" /&gt; It put their combined value at $1.3 million, most of which was accounted for by the older, Achaemenid piece, with the Roman head valued at a mere $40,000.&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story"&gt;{{cite news|title=Police recover item stolen from Fine Arts Museum|url=http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/man-who-bought-stolen-artwork-didn-t-know-it-was-worth-1-2-million-1.1684657|newspaper=[[CTV Television Network|CTV]]|date=February 14, 2014|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Fossey, an archaeologist, told [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] later that he believed the two pieces had not been stolen to order but simply because they were "small [and] easy to put in the bag."&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story" /&gt; Another expert involved, art-theft investigator Mark Dalrymple, observed that the case was similar to a series of 2004 thefts from the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] in [[Toronto]], which also involved small objects taken by visitors while the museum was open to the public, objects whose return he had secured. He said the museum was preparing photos for dissemination worldwide. "[N]o matter where in the world these pieces go, no one can sell them", he told ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''. He advised anyone in possession of the missing art to return it immediately.&lt;ref name="2011 theft story" /&gt;

===Sale of relief===
Unbeknownst to Dalrymple or any of the other investigators, by the time he made that statement at least one of the missing pieces had already been sold. In November 2011 Simon Metke, a [[Yoga as exercise|yoga]] teacher from [[Edmonton]], travelled to Montreal for a visit.&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story" /&gt; A friend of his there had told him that someone he knew was selling what he described as a stone sculpture of a soldier, claiming it was a genuine antiquity. As a result of his own recent spiritual explorations, Metke had developed an interest in ancient cultures, and the friend thought he might be interested in buying the sculpture.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;
[[File:Achaemenid relief of guard in Montreal Museum of Fine Arts.jpg|right|thumb|The stolen Achaemenid relief that Metke believed was merely a replica|alt=A stone panel with the head of a bearded man seen in profile, the top of his shield, and an upright spear tip on the left]]
When Metke finally saw the sculpture, actually the Achaemenid [[relief]] that had been stolen from the museum a few months earlier, he was at first skeptical. He believed it might actually be a replica, something that he might otherwise find at modern stores that sell home decor. But he appreciated the workmanship that had gone into it.&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story" /&gt;

The seller's asking price was [[Canadian dollar|CDN$]]1,400. According to Metke's friend, the seller was motivated. "This other guy had to pay his child support you know and pay his rent," Metke recalled later. "He edged me on that it was worth a bunch more."&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story" /&gt;

Still, Metke had some lingering doubts about the item. So he did a [[Google]] search on "Are there any [[Mesopotamian]] artifacts missing?" After he had satisfied himself from the results that he was not buying something looted or stolen, he bought the item, believing that, with [[2012 phenomenon|2012]], the last year in the [[Mayan Calendar]], a month away, it was his destiny to acquire the artwork.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt; "It symbolized part of my spiritual journey to me."&lt;ref name="CBC arrest story"&gt;{{cite news|title=Stolen artifact from Montreal museum recovered in Edmonton|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/stolen-artifact-from-montreal-museum-recovered-in-edmonton-1.2535754|newspaper=[[CBC News]]|date=February 14, 2014|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He thought "it would have been kind of fun" to take it to an ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'' production, or go to the [[Middle East]] himself and have it authenticated. For the time being, he packed the piece in his luggage and flew with it back to Edmonton, where the airline briefly lost the suitcase containing the relief upon his arrival. Once it was located, he took it home and put it in a [[meditation]] area he had set up in his living room.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;

Later he moved it to a shelf in his bedroom, where he put it amid a collection of ''[[Star Wars (franchise)|Star Wars]]'' action figures, crystals and stuffed animals.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt; A month after returning to Edmonton, he gave an interview to a [[CBC News]] crew for a story unrelated to the artwork he had just purchased. It was, however, visible on the shelf behind him in some shots.&lt;ref name="CBC arrest story" /&gt;

==Recovery of relief and arrests==
The interview eventually led to a tip to police. In late 2013 they obtained a [[search warrant|warrant to search]] Metke's Edmonton condominium, and in January 2014 executed it. "The sun's coming in through the window, the bougainvillea flowers are glowing, the crystals are making rainbows," recalled Metke.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;

A team of [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) from both [[Alberta]] and [[Quebec]], along with the SQ/AXA investigators, quickly located the relief. It was only then that Metke learned it had been stolen, and was indeed an authentic antique artifact 2,500 years old, not a replica. "I don't think he knew it was worth $1.2 million dollars either," he said of the seller.&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story" /&gt; He felt, again, that it was destiny that had brought the relief to him. "[I]t sort of feels like it may have come to me to be protected so that it didn't get destroyed or lost."&lt;ref name="CBC Metke story"&gt;{{cite news|title=Man accused of owning stolen artifact tells his story|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/man-accused-of-owning-stolen-artifact-tells-his-story-1.2536685|newspaper=[[CBC News]]|date=February 13, 2014|accessdate=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the arrest, police suggested they had some leads on the identity of the thief.&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story" /&gt; However, as of 2017 no arrests have been made. The whereabouts of the Roman head are also unknown.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;

Police charged Metke with [[Possession of stolen goods#Canada|possession of stolen property over $5,000 in value]], possession of the proceeds of a crime, and possessing a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking, after they also found drugs in the residence. Metke's girlfriend faced the former two charges related to the relief as well.&lt;ref name="CBC arrest story" /&gt; Fossey, who was in Edmonton that day as well, flew home to Montreal with the relief that night. "It's a day I'll never forget, flying back with it in a box at my feet," he said later.&lt;ref name="Press artifact return story" /&gt; 

The museum, however, would have to consider whether to buy it back from AXA, since once it was recovered it became the insurer's legal property; commonly a buyback clause in the policy allows a museum to do this by returning the money paid. The board said it would meet to consider the possibility.&lt;ref name="Artnet recovery story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kinsella|first=Eileen|title=Stolen Artifact Returned to Montreal Museum ...

==Trial==
The Crown later [[Stay of proceedings|stayed]] two of the three charges against Metke, and all that it had laid against his girlfriend. In April 2017, he pled guilty to the possession of stolen goods charge. A statement of facts his lawyers agreed on with prosecutors said that while he clearly was unaware the relief had been stolen, he could have done more to assure himself of its [[provenance]]. In return the judge gave him a [[discharge (sentence)|conditional discharge]] with [[probation]] and [[community service]]. Both sides described the case as "unique" and "extraordinary".&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;

==''Yoga Hosers''==
At the time of Metke's arrest, American filmmaker [[Kevin Smith]] discussed the story on his [[podcast]], ''[[SModcast]]'', amused by Metke's description of the bougainvillea and crystals that morning. His co-host, [[Scott Mosier]], imagined how the RCMP might have spoken to Metke, saying "Open up, yoga [[hoser]]!" The last two words became a minor [[catchphrase]] among their fans.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;

In April, Smith announced he was working on a screenplay called ''[[Yoga Hosers]]''. He completed the film in time for the January 2016 [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It was not based on Metke's story, but one character in the film, a [[yoga as exercise|yoga]] instructor named Yogi Bayer, was inspired by Metke. [[Justin Long]], who played Bayer, attempted to contact Metke while preparing for the role; Metke did not respond until after Long had shot his scenes.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;

'''Alternate ending''' ([[British English]]: '''alternative ending''') is a term used (usually in movies) to describe the ending of a story that was planned or debated but ultimately unused in favor of the actual ending. Generally, alternative endings are considered to have no bearing on the [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] narrative. On the internet, amateurs may make their own alternative endings.

==Examples in film==
Alternative endings are often filmed before being scrapped, and may be subsequently included as a special feature in the film's [[DVD]] release. These alternative endings are a special type of [[deleted scene]]. In other cases, ideas that were presented but discarded early on are alluded to by the production team in commentary or interviews.

Some films or movies also present the alternative ending on International releases as well as their international Home media release, with its original region release only showing the alternative ending on certain TV channels.

The following are examples of known alternative endings to movies:
*''[[1408 (film)|1408]]'': An alternative ending is present on the director's cut disc (much like ''The Butterfly Effect'', with a few deleted scenes reinserted) Mike Enslin dies in the fire he causes. At his burial, his wife is approached by the hotel manager, offering his personal belongings. She refuses, and he lets her know that her husband did not die in vain. Back in his vehicle he listens to the tape recorder, and screams in fear as he sees Enslin's burned deformed body in his back seat for only a moment. The film closes with an apparition of Mike Enslin still in 1408, muttering to himself, hears his daughter's voice, and finally exiting the room with her.
*''[[28 Days Later]]'': Several darker alternative endings (filmed, available on the DVD release). The first has Jim gravely injured near the end of the film and he is taken to a hospital, but he dies before he can be given medical attention, and his body is left behind (completing a cycle in the movie; he woke up alone in a hospital and has now died there). Some versions also involve him dreaming of the accident that put him in the hospital at the beginning of the film. Another unfilmed ending picks up after Frank has been infected, where they take him to a research complex and Jim sacrifices his own life to give him a total blood transfusion to restore him, and he is once again left alone in a hospital bed. This was discarded for being too unbelievable.
*''[[3 Ninjas]]'': The American cut originally showed that the boys had won the basketball challenge and effortlessly won Emily's bike back. In an extended international version of this movie, they lose the basketball challenge along with their own bikes, so a scene ends the international version of the film in which they fight the bullies to get them back, as an alternative ending. In the United States, this alternative ending can only be seen on certain television channels such as ''[[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]]'', [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] and [[Showtime MAX]]; international [[DVD]]s have this version, as well.
*''[[Army of Darkness]]'': In an alternative ending after Ash drinks the potion that would make him sleep long enough to wake up in his own time, he inadvertently drinks too much and wakes up in the future. Realizing that the world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland, Ash screams "I slept too long!"
*''[[The Astronaut's Wife]]'': When Spencer is killed, Jillian is not possessed by the alien. Instead, she moves out to the country. Sitting beneath a tree, looking up at the stars, she tunes her radio to the same signals Spencer was receiving while possessed by the alien - her twin babies controlling her movements from inside the womb, listening - and waiting...
*''[[Blade: Trinity]]'': The original ending is far more ambiguous with Dracula and Blade's fates not as determined. The ending only appears in the unrated DVD and was intended by the director [[David S. Goyer]]. Another alternate ending was seen showing Hannibal King and Abigail Whistler confront a werewolf.
*''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'': An alternative ending on the DVD has Bourne collapsing during the search for Marie, waking up with Abbot standing over him, and getting an offer to return to the CIA.
*''[[The Butterfly Effect]]'': Evan watches a home video of his mother pregnant with him and returns to the memory of himself as a fetus. Convinced that his very existence has ruined the lives of those around him, he strangles himself with his [[umbilical cord]] and dies, [[stillbirth|stillborn]]. This "[[Director's Cut]]" ending is much darker than the theatrical ending, where he simply stops himself from becoming friends with Kayleigh.
*''[[Child's Play 2]]'': An extended ending reveals that a chunk of Chucky's skin after his head exploded got mixed in with the Good Guy doll making plaster. A machine is then seen making a new Good Guy Doll head, which then forms a sinister smile.
*''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'': After defeating the Kraken and Hades, Andromeda falls into the sea and Perseus dives in to save her. When he reaches her, he embraces her with a passionate kiss, indicating that he fell in love with her, and she with him. After reaching the shore and regaining consciousness, Andromeda asks Perseus if he will stay and he says there is someone he needs to talk to, before kissing her again, indicating that he will come back. Getting on Pegasus, he flies to Mt. Olympus (although the special effects are incomplete) where he confronts Zeus, stating that he does not wish to be one of them and that any conflict between them has just started. After slamming his sword into the gods' map and shattering the models of every living person, he leaves and is seen flying on Pegasus over the sea, presumably back to Argos (although the special effects are incomplete).
*''[[Clerks]]'': Dante is still inside the Quick Stop after it closes. A customer enters and, without saying a word, shoots Dante after he tells him they are closed, and empties the cash register. The credits then roll, and when they are over a customer comes in and sees the counter empty without noticing Dante's body on the ground behind the counter.
*''[[Clue (film)|Clue]]'' had four different endings, and each one distributed to theatres had one of ''three'' of them. The video and DVD version had all of these three endings on it. The fourth one has not been included because the director did not approve of it.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088930/alternateversions&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'': In an alternative ending found on the special edition DVD it is presumed that Simon's robbery of the Federal Reserve succeeds, with McClane catching up with Gruber months later in Austria. McClane's police career is in ruins, and he is keen to take it out on Gruber, who he invites to play a game called "McClane Says". This involves a form of Russian Roulette with a small Chinese rocket launcher with the sights removed, meaning it cannot be determined which end is which. McClane then asks Gruber some riddles similar to the ones he played in New York. When Gruber gets a riddle wrong, McClane forces him at gunpoint to fire the launcher, which blows Gruber to bits. This ending is in the novelization, only McClane fools Gruber into thinking the tube-like launcher is pointed at McClane. Gruber guesses the trick question and shoots himself.
*''[[Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story]]'': The Average Joes lose the game when White Goodman hits Peter with the ball. According to the DVD commentary, this was the writer's original intention for the movie, but the studio insisted it be changed - hence the "real" ending - when test audiences reacted poorly to the unhappy ending. (The antagonist references this right at the end of the movie, by mocking the audience for wanting a happy ending and saying, "You happy now?")
*''[[Ella Enchanted (film)|Ella Enchanted]]'': The movie was originally supposed to end in a scene after the wedding, where Hattie is turned into a frog by Lucinda, Ella's father demands a divorce from Dame Olga, Heston is still alive but suffering torment from the Char Fan Club, Slannen becomes a lawyer, and Dame Olga ends up with Nish. No one knows why, but they cut the scene out and replaced the ending with a musical ending with the entire cast present and they exit like they do on stage.
*''[[Fatal Attraction]]'': Alex Forrest (Glenn Close) was originally scripted to commit suicide at the end of the movie and make it look like Dan (Michael Douglas) had murdered her, for which he was arrested. Test audiences did not respond well to this finale, mainly due to a lack of revenge from Beth and the family, especially when Beth tells Alex "If you ever come near my family again, I'll kill you". This resulted in a three-week re-shoot for the action-filled sequence in the bathroom and Alex's death by shooting. The fact that Beth shoots Alex makes a direct comparison between the two characters, Alex being a victim, and Beth taking control to protect her family.
*''[[Final Destination (film)|Final Destination]]'': Alex is killed when he grabs the downed power line to save Claire, ending Death's pattern. In the final scene it turns out that Claire is pregnant with Alex's baby.
*''[[Final Destination 2]]'': The original movie was supposed to end with Kimberly and Officer Burke embracing in the hospital after Kimberly is revived. Instead, David Ellis, the director, decided to end the film with a bang and include the barbecue scene.
*''[[Final Destination 3]]'': The film has two alternative endings (based on the viewer's choices on the DVD). In the first ending, Ian is fully crushed by the sign and Wendy, Kevin, and Julie decide what to do next. In the second ending, which involves the subway, the train headed for Wendy actually hits her, instead of being a vision.
*''[[The Final Destination]]'': In one alternative ending, Nick realizes he has to kill himself for the chain to end. So, he puts out the initial fire and then jumps out a window, killing himself. Later, Janet and Lori sadly embrace, as Lori says, "The chain is broken." Suddenly, a piece of the chain holding the A/C unit breaks and lands next to Lori. Lori picks it up, and the unit drops and crushes Lori and Janet, with Lori's hand holding the chain sliding into the audience's face in 3D. In another, Nick is also crushed with Lori in the escalator, instead of it being a vision.
*''[[Final Destination 5]]'': In an alternative ending, which was in the original script, Sam, Molly and Nathan take a walk through memorial park believing they finally cheated Death but Death is still in action after Nathan is crushed by Flight 180's landing gear while Sam and Molly stare at him in horror.
*''[[First Blood]]'': In an alternative ending, Rambo commits suicide rather than be arrested. This alternate ending is included as an extra on the First Blood Ultimate Edition DVD released in 2004.
*''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'': Chris wakes up the morning after killing Jason, only to find he is still alive when she opens the back door of the lake house. Jason then proceeds to cut off Chris's head, and the scene immediately switches to Chris waking up screaming in the back of the police car, revealing her entire death was a dream and Jason remains dead in the barn.
*''[[Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter]]'': An alternative ending to the film, included in the 2009 Deluxe Edition DVD, shows a dream sequence where Trish and Tommy wake up the next morning after killing Jason to the sound of police sirens. Trish sends Tommy to summon the police who have arrived next door. At that point she notices water dripping from the ceiling and goes to investigate. She enters the upstairs bathroom, and finds the body of her mother, drowned in the bathtub. At that moment, Mrs. Jarvis' eyes open and Jason appears behind Trish, ready to strike. Trish then suddenly wakes up in the hospital in a scene reminiscent of the ending of the first movie. In his commentary, the director says this scene was cut because it interfered with the idea that this would be the final film.
*''[[Game of Death]]'': This movie has two alternative endings. In the [[Hong Kong]] [[Cantonese]]  print, after we see Billy defeating Dr. Land, who falls from the rooftop, the police and an ambulance arrives there. The police arrest Billy and the ambulance takes Dr. Land. In the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] print it shows that after defeating Dr. Land, Billy is with Ann at a harbour, saying good-bye to Jim. The next scene shows a ship departing and a picture of [[Bruce Lee]]. This scene of the ship departing is also in the Hong Kong ending.
*''[[Happy Death Day]]'': An alternative ending has Tree recovering in the hospital from her ordeal with Lori, while being visited by her father and Carter. After they leave, a nurse enters to administer pain medication to Tree, with Tree stating that it was against doctor's orders. The nurse later reveals herself as Stephanie Butler, the wife of Dr. Gregory Butler, and she later kills Tree out of revenge for her affair with Gregory.
*''[[Hide and Seek (2005 film)|Hide and Seek]]'': This movie had many different endings on whether [[Dakota Fanning]]'s character, Emily had split personality and whether she ended up at a mental hospital or at a new home.
*''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'': The "Monster Woman" that Robert Neville captures in order to run a "cure" test becomes the key to his survival in the end. As the "Alpha Monster" begins to break into the lab area, he stops, and Robert Neville suddenly realizes that all they want is the "Monster Woman" back. So Robert Neville rolls her out of the lab and awakens her out of her medicated state, and the "Alpha Monster" picks her up and takes her away, leaving Neville alive after his ordeal. (NOTE: The creatures are a mutation from man's cure to cancer)
*''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'': In the alternative ending, Julie receives an invite to a pool party and reads an email that reads "I still know". This scene was used in the trailer for the film.
*''[[Infernal Affairs]]'': In the mainland Chinese version, the police found evidence proving Lau Kin Ming ([[Andy Lau]]) is a triad mole and is arrested and the film end. The sequel, ''[[Infernal Affairs III]]'', follows the original Hong Kong ending where Lau got away with his crime.
*''[[Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'': In one of the most famous changed endings, the original conclusion to the off-Broadway musical was filmed and preferred by Frank Oz the director and the majority of the actors. However, test audiences disliked how Audrey and Seymour, the main protagonists, were both killed by the evil alien plant, and the ending had to be re-shot so that their deaths were removed.
*''[[Men in Black II]]'': The original ending for the film featured a scene in which the towers of the World Trade Center opened to release a swarm of UFOS. After the terrorist attacks in 2001, the ending was reshot.
* ''[[Orphan (2009 film)|Orphan]]'': In an alternative ending, Esther is seen hurrying into her room. There, she is shown with a face covered in blood while she re-applies her makeup. She then puts on the dress she wore for her first day of school and greets the police, who arrived after receiving Kate's frantic call before she reached the house, at the top of the stairs by curtsying and introducing herself, and then she is seen descending the stairs into the crowd of police. It is not explained whether or not she has killed Kate or Max in the alternative ending, although the dead body of John can be seen. However, due to the excess blood on Esther's face in the alternative ending and the fact that she is not wet, it is a possibility that she killed both Max and Kate.
*''[[Paranormal Activity]]'': In one version of the film that was shown at only one public viewing, Katie returns to the bedroom after the screaming and noise of her and Micah struggling downstairs. She is holding a knife and covered in blood. She closes and locks the bedroom door. Katie walks over and smiles at the camera, then slits her own throat. There is a third ending in which, after killing Micah, Katie returns to the bedroom and sits down against the bed with the knife in her hand, rocking back and forth, for almost two days straight. Katie's sister comes looking for her, but when she enters the house, she is heard screaming after seeing Micah's body. The creature possessing Katie leaves her body, and scares Katie's sister out of the house, before returning to Katie, who resumes rocking back and forth. The police arrive at the house about 30 minutes later, and Katie comes out of the bedroom with her knife, calling for Micah. Following a heated confrontation, a door behind the officers slams shut, causing the officers to shoot Katie.
*''[[Paycheck (film)|Paycheck]]'': Jennings and Rachel are wondering what to do next when Jennings spots the kid who stole the engagement ring from him on the subway coming out of a pawn shop. He goes into the shop for a few minutes and when he comes back he asks Rachel "do you believe in fate?" and they kiss. It is assumed he then proposes to her because it fades to black at that point.
*''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]'': Both main characters are killed off by a man they forgot to shoot down.
*''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'': [[Rocky Balboa|Rocky]] defeats [[Mason Dixon (Rocky Balboa character)|Mason "The Line" Dixon]] by split decision. In the actual movie, it is reversed.
*''[[Ronin (film)|Ronin]]'': Deirdre is seen on the stairs next to the café considering joining Sam and Vincent. Deciding against it, she walks up the stairs. As she is getting into her car, she is snatched into a van by men in the IRA who call her a traitor. It is implied that she is later killed. Sam and Vincent finish their conversation and depart, completely unaware of what has just happened.
*''[[Scream 3]]'': When [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]] enters the screening room, he does not have a white sheet covering him. After Roman notices [[Sidney Prescott]] has disappeared after he supposedly killed her, he searches the screening room for her shouting and telling her all the doors are locked, most of the scene shows Sidney's point of view which was not shown in the actual ending. Also, Kincaid does not enter the screening room in this ending.
*''[[Scary Movie 3]]'': Cindy is told Cody does not exist. After hitting a few people in the face with a shovel, Cindy asks everybody who is not real to stand a specific spot. Cody goes there, and is followed by [[Santa Claus]]. The aliens then begin to invade but George stops them by transforming into [[Hulk (comics)|The Hulk]]. President Harris tries to hulk out, but ends up soiling his pants. Cindy enters the Logan House, where she is attacked by Tabitha. She is teleported away to Aunt Shaneequa, who teaches her how to defeat Tabitha. Cindy must then confront hundreds of Tabithas. She wins the battle by performing moves from ''The Matrix'' and teleports back to the Logan House. The cast then gets into a car with the President, but are horrified to learn that the driver happens to be [[M. Night Shyamalan]].
*''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'': Writer, Andrew Kevin Walker, completed two separate drafts of the ending. The first was used in the theatrical edition of the film. In the second, John Doe is killed by Somerset instead of Mills. This alternate ending sequence was storyboarded and is included in the published script, but never filmed, however it does appear on an extra disk on the DVD Release.
*''[[Sliver (film)|Sliver]]'': Sharon Stone and the killer fly over a volcano when the killer suddenly confesses his crimes. He then veers the aircraft into the volcano as the end credits roll and leaves the audience to decide whether they survive.
*''[[Smokin' Aces]]'': Rather than pulling the life support cords of Israel and Sparazza as he does in the used ending, he instead draws his weapon and empties his pistol into them.
*''[[Super Troopers]]'': Another ending was filmed that starts the same way as the real ending; by the police station being closed down. This time, the former officers are now working in a meat packing plant. They talk to their boss saying that bad meat should not be sent out for people to buy, and the boss says to do it any way. At this point the officers take off their jacket to reveal that they are now local police officers and chase him throughout the meat packing plant.
*''[[Swordfish (film)|Swordfish]]'': The DVD version contains an alternative ending wherein Ginger is told in the bank that the account is already empty, alluding to the possibility that Stanley has played one final trick on them and taken the money himself. In a companion scene to the alternative ending, Stanley is shown on a trip with his daughter in a brand new RV. While eating at a diner, Stanley is shown transferring many billion dollars to various charities before continuing his trip.
*''[[The Terminator]]'': The alternative ending, included in some DVD releases, shows the cleanup and police response at the factory shortly after the final battle between Kyle and the terminator. A group of company representatives find the terminator wreckage and decide to hide it from police and have it analyzed. The film then ends by the screen panning out to show that the factory was owned by Cyberdyne Systems. The sequel is based on this alternative ending.
*''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'': The alternative ending shows Sarah Connor alive and well on August 29, 2029. She is by then a grandmother (and John Connor is a Senator) in a world where Skynet was never able to start its war on humanity.
*''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'': Old Rose is seen by her granddaughter dropping the diamond into the ocean.
*''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'': While Nicole and Michèle waiting in front of Stade Charléty, there was a duel between André and Jacques in the French football stadium. Jacques is shot down by a sniper. This ending was poorly received by audiences during test screenings.
*''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'': Not only different endings were intended to use in this film, but nearly a whole different plot, significantly the role of [[Jean Grey]] being more aggressive and disobeying direct orders of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] several times. The alternative endings are: the re-opening of the Xavier Institute in which [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] is now a professor; [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]] coming back to [[Alberta, Canada]], specifically the very same tavern seen in the first ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]''; and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] keeping her powers.
* ''[[Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'' had two different endings. One had Lady Totington marrying PC Mackintosh and another had Lady Totington visiting Wallace and giving Gromit the golden carrot.
* ''[[Whisper (film)|Whisper]]'': In the alternative ending, the kidnapper Max has chased the demon boy David through the forest David makes him believe the wolves around him are the people who died. When they turn into wolves, they attack Max, but instead of throwing the axe and hitting David, Max holds on to the axe as he falls and the wolves maul him to death. Afterwards, the cops show up and wrap David up in a blanket and take him to safety. As the police van leaves, you can see David smiling.

==Examples in television==
In TV shows, producers may want to keep the ending of an episode a secret, even if it means keeping it from the stars themselves. In such a case, they will usually film more than one ending and not tell the cast which one will be used.
*''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'': To keep the ending to Season 1 a surprise, the crew shot multiple endings to the finale (Teri's death was the one they aired). A second ending had Teri live through the gunshot, and a third had her not being shot at all, with the family embracing each other after the long day was over.
*''[[D.I.E]]'': In original ending, Yue Sir ([[Roger Kwok]]) dies from a car accident and the audience wanted a happier ending so TVB created a new one in the style of [[mo lei tau]] comedy. In the new ending, the cast tries to stop the car accident that would kill Yue Sir from happening.
*''[[E.U. (TV series)|E.U.]]'': Due to the popularity of [[Michael Tse]]'s character Laughing Gor, who died in episode 22, an ending was shot where Laughing changes into his police uniform and talks. The ending never implied whether Laughing is alive or not and leaves it open for the audience to decide.
*''[[Green Wing]]'': In the final [[Green Wing Special|Special]], Guy and Mac are dragged into the air in an attempt to rescue Caroline, who has been dragged into the air by holding too many helium balloons. Whilst in the air, Mac tells Caroline he has something to tell her. After walking into the sea, Alan and Joanna are last seen hanging onto a buoy, waiting to drown. The actors wanted to use this ending but it was turned down. It was thought that this ending would have been used if a third series was being made.
*''[[Sex and the City]]'': In the series finale three endings were shot, in which [[Carrie Bradshaw]]'': (1) becomes engaged to [[Aleksandr Petrovsky]], (2) resumes her relationship with [[Mr. Big (Sex and the City)|Mr. Big]], and (3) turns down both suitors and reaffirms her love for her friends.
*''[[The Simpsons]]'': In the two part episode "[[Who Shot Mr. Burns?]]" there was an alternative ending where it was revealed that the shooter of Mr. Burns was [[Waylon Smithers]] rather than [[Maggie Simpson]]. Shots of other characters shooting Mr. Burns were also fully animated, though no other complete ending scenes were produced. (These alternative shootings were intended to be intentionally 'leaked' as an elaborate practical joke on the media, but the producers could find no journalists who would take the bait.)
*''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'': At the end of Season 4, the audience learns that one of the main characters will die in the future. To keep the identity of this person a secret, three different versions of the final scene were shot. The canonical ending shows that Locke will die, while the alternative endings had Sawyer and Desmond die.
*''[[Total Drama]]'': For every season of this animated "reality show", 2 endings were filmed in which both finalists would win the competition. Every country Total Drama aired in got to decide which ending to air.
*''[[King of the Hill]]'': Some episodes have alternative endings (including the episode "The Company Man"), which can be found on the DVD Special Features.
*''[[Psych]]'': the episode "100 Clues", a parody of the board game Clue, had alternate endings where the fans decided  who was the culprit of murdering a guest at a party. Also, the episode "Right Turn or Left for Dead" involves the main character, Shawn, playing out an alternative ending to the episode in his head had events in the previous episode been slightly different.
*''[[Pretty Little Liars]]'': In the episode, "The Lady Killer," three endings were shot, each revealing a member of the A-Team. Because the producers wanted to keep this member a secret from everyone (including the cast members), they shot three endings and did not tell anyone who the member of the A-Team was. Out of Paige's alternate ending, Caleb's ending, and Toby's ending, the producers ended up showing Toby's.
*''[[Secrets and Lies (U.S. TV series)|Secrets and Lies]]'': In order to keep the real killer's identity secret until the end, several multiple endings were shot.

==Examples in video games==
{{Main|Types_of_fiction_with_multiple_endings#Video_games|l1=Video games with multiple endings}}
Many video games also have alternative endings. These endings are generally posed after completing the game in a harder difficulty, or taking a different route through the game's storyline.

==Examples in music==
*English rock band [[Marillion]]'s 1994 [[concept album]] ''[[Brave (Marillion album)|Brave]]'' is one of the very few examples of an alternative ending appearing in the medium of music. The vinyl edition of ''Brave'' featured a [[multisided record|double groove]] on side B of the second record, the final side of the album: depending on where the needle was dropped, the record would either play the standard track listing (the songs "The Great Escape" and "Made Again") or would instead play only an alternative version of "The Great Escape" with different lyrics, presenting an alternative, darker ending to the album's story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marillion.com/music/albums/brave.htm |title=Marillion – 'Brave' |publisher=marillion.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples in literature==
* [[Felix Salten]]’s ''[[The Hound of Florence]]'' differs greatly in the original [[German language]] (''Der Hund von Florenz'') and in the [[English language|English]] translation. The German-language version ends in [[tragedy]]: the archduke stabs the dog to death, killing Lukas, and his body is disposed of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=Der Hund von Florenz | location=Wien | publisher=Herz-Verlag | date=1923 | language=German | page=184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the English translation, a wholly new ending of six more pages has been written: Lukas survives, gets medication and is united with the [[courtesan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=The Hound of Florence: A Novel | date=1930 | location=New York | publisher=Simon and Schuster | translator=Huntley Paterson | others=Illustrated by Kurt Wiese | pages=230– }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it is not known if the alternate ending is authorized.

'''American modernism''', much like the [[modernism]] movement in general, is a trend of philosophical thought arising from the widespread changes in culture and society in the age of [[modernity]]. American modernism is an artistic and cultural movement in the United States beginning at the turn of the 20th century, with a core period between World War I and World War II. Like its European counterpart, American modernism stemmed from a rejection of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking, seeking to better represent reality in a new, more industrialized world.&lt;ref&gt;Singal, Daniel Joseph. "Towards a Definition of American Modernism". ''American Quarterly'' 39.1 (1987): 7–26. Web ...&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Characteristically, [[modernism|modernist]] art has a tendency to abstraction, is innovative, aesthetic, futuristic and self-referential. It includes [[visual art]], [[literature]], music, film, [[design]], [[architecture]] as well as [[Life style (sociology)|life style]]. It reacts against [[historicism (art)|historicism]], artistic conventions and [[institutionalization]] of art. Art was not only to be dealt with in academies, theaters or concert halls, but to be included in everyday life and accessible for everybody. Furthermore, cultural institutions concentrated on [[fine art]] and scholars paid little attention to the revolutionary styles of modernism. Economic and technological progress in the U.S. during the [[Roaring Twenties]] gave rise to widespread [[utopianism]], which influenced some modernist artists, while others were skeptical of the embrace of technology. The victory in World War I confirmed the status of the U.S. as an international player and gave the people self-confidence and a feeling of security. In this context, American modernism marked the beginning of American art as distinct and autonomous from European taste, by breaking artistic conventions that had been shaped after European traditions until then.

American modernism benefited from the diversity of immigrant cultures. Artists were inspired by African, Caribbean, Asian and European folk cultures and embedded these exotic styles in their works.

The Modernist American movement was a reflection of American life in the 20th century. In the quickly industrializing world and hastened pace of life, it was easy for the individual to be swallowed up by the vastness of things, left wandering, devoid of purpose. Social boundaries in race, class, sex, wealth and religion were being challenged. As the social structure was challenged by new incoming views, the bounds of traditional standards and social structure dissolved, and a loss of identity was what remained, translating eventually into isolation, alienation and an overall feeling of separateness from any kind of "whole". The unity of a war-rallied country was dying, along with it the illusion of the pleasantries it sold to its soldiers and people. The world was left violent, vulgar and spiritually empty.

The middle class worker fell into a distinctly unnoticeable position, a cog much too small to hope to find recognition in a much greater machine. Citizens were overcome with their own futility. Youths' dreams shattered with failure and a disillusioning disappointment in recognition of limit and loss. The lives of the disillusioned and outcasts became more focal. Ability to define self through hard work and resourcefulness, to create your own vision of yourself without the help of traditional means, became prized. Some authors endorsed this, while others, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, challenged how alluring but destructively false the values of privilege can be.

Modernist America had to find common ground in a world no longer unified in belief. The unity found lay in the common ground of the shared consciousness within all human experience. The importance of the individual was emphasized; the truly limited nature of the human experience formed a bond across all bridges of race, class, sex, wealth or religion. Society, in this way, found shared meaning, even in disarray.

Some see modernism in the tradition of 19th century [[aestheticism]] and the "[[art for art's sake]]" movement. [[Clement Greenberg]] argues that modernist art excludes "anything outside itself". Others see modernist art, for example in [[blues]] and [[jazz]] music, as a medium for emotions and moods, and many works dealt with contemporary issues, like feminism and city life. Some artists and theoreticians even added a political dimension to American modernism.

American modernist design and architecture enabled people to lead a modern life. Work and family life changed radically and rapidly due to the economic upswing during the 1920s. In the U.S., the car became popular and affordable for many, leisure time and entertainment gained importance and the job market opened up for women. In order to make life more efficient, designers and architects aimed at the simplification of housework.

The [[Great Depression]] at the end of the '20s and during the '30s disillusioned people about the economic stability of the country and eroded utopianist thinking. The outbreak and the terrors of World War II caused further changes in mentality. The [[Post-war]] period that followed was termed [[Late Modernism]]. The ''[[Postmodernist]]'' era was generally considered characteristic of the art of the late 20th century beginning in the 1980s.

==Jazz==
:''For a wider, more formal account, please see [[Jazz]] and [[Jazz Age]]''.
Early in the 20th century, [[jazz]] evolved from the [[blues]] tradition, but also incorporated many other musical and cultural elements. In [[New Orleans]], often considered the birthplace of jazz, musicians benefited from the influx of Spanish and French colonial influences. In this city, a unique ethnic cultural mix and looser racial prohibitions allowed African Americans more influence than in other regions of the South. The [[Spanish–American War]] brought Northern soldiers to the region with their bands. The resulting music adopted sounds from the new brass instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, John. ''Blues and jazz in American Culture''. Bielefeld University, Bielefeld (Germany). 2 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], jazz spread from New Orleans to New York, Chicago, and other cities, incorporating new sounds along the way. [[Harlem]], New York City, became the new center for the [[jazz age]].&lt;ref&gt;Salamon, Frank A. "Expatriate Jazz Musicians in Europe." Ed. William Boelhower, et al. ''Sites of Ethnicity: Europe and the Americas''. Heidelberg: Universitätsverlag Winter GmbH, 2004. 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jazz – music of integration===
[[Jazz]] music, as a central element of American culture, has its roots in Black slave culture. The music combined elements from African call and response patterns into its instrumentation and riffs.&lt;ref&gt;Huggins, Nathan Irvin. ''Harlem Renaissance''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1971. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; In its beginnings jazz was looked critically upon by parts of the white population, who thought that jazz and [[ragtime]] rhythms were "savage crash and bang,"&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lawrence W. "Jazz and American Culture." Ed. Robert O'Meally. ''The Jazz Cadence of American Culture''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; and denigrated the genre as a product "not of innovators, but of incompetents."&lt;ref&gt;Levine 437, ''NY Times'', 1924&lt;/ref&gt; Its expressive and pulsating style initially served racial stereotypes in the public mind and was widely encountered with skeptical rejection. Despite this phenomenon of animosity towards a rising Black cultural significance, American writer Lawrence W. Levine interprets the role of jazz as a catalyst of a shifting national consciousness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Culturally, we remained to a much larger extent than we have yet recognized, a colonized people attempting to define itself in the shadow of the former imperial power. Jazz was an expression of that other side of ourselves that strove to recognize the positive aspects of our newness and our heterogeneity; that learned to be comfortable with the fact that a significant part of our heritage derived from Africa and other non-European sources; and that recognized in the various syncretized cultures that became so characteristic of the United States an embarrassing weakness but a dynamic source of strength.&lt;ref&gt;Levine 434&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After all, it was in the nature of jazz to strive for cultural convergence between blacks and whites; according to saxophonist [[Sonny Rollins]], "Jazz has always been a music of integration."&lt;ref&gt;Levine 440&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s and 1930s jazz gained considerably in popularity and aroused increasing interest in young whites who were attracted by the artistic, personal as well as cultural freedom of expression this new musical form had to offer. Well-known white musicians such as [[Benny Goodman]], [[Gene Krupa]], Milton Mezzrow, [[Muggsy Spanier]] or [[Joe Sullivan]] were inspired by Afro-American icons like [[Louis Armstrong]]. The acceptance of jazz soon spread across the Atlantic and, by the mid-20th century, made it international. Today, jazz music is regarded as an integral and vibrant part of American culture, the unique native music of America, a worldwide representative of Afro-American culture.

===Jazz as American===
A compilation article appearing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1923 proclaimed jazz, "... a contribution of America to the arts. It is recognized the world over as part of a musical folk lore of this country: it is as thoroughly and typically American as the [[Monroe Doctrine]] or the [[Fourth of July]], or [[baseball]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Say Jazz Will Live." ''The New York Times''. 23 December 1923: Page XX4&lt;/ref&gt;

Jazz's American-ness begins with its roots. Jazz was a product of African Americans, a cultural group distinct to America. Though the early [[blues]] sang distinctly of the sorrows of a displaced people, jazz was something else. The African American labor class who gave birth to jazz were not subject to the education of other white musicians; black minstrels were able to escape the pressure to "Europeanize" their art. Culture (with a capital C) essentially demanded that Americans prefer, commend, and reiterate all things European. Free from these constraints, jazz progressed in an uncharted manner.&lt;ref&gt;Huggins 60&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, [[Irving Berlin]] called jazz "American folk music" and cited influences ranging from "old Southern Songs" and the "Negro spirituals", to a "tinge of the Russian and Italian folk songs", but Berlin concluded that it was "typically American above all."&lt;ref&gt;"Berlin Calls Jazz American Folk Music." ''The New York Times''. 10 January 1925. pg 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the nation where it was created, jazz blended separate [[ethnic]] and cultural influences into a new and different product, combining elements from Black identity with other immigrant influences. It incorporated the sounds of the South and the modern, and adapted elements from urban skylines.&lt;ref&gt;Kouwenhoven, John A. "What's 'American' About America." Ed. Robert O'Meally. ''The Jazz Cadence of American Culture''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1998. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Jazz was distinctly American in that it blended the character of different peoples, but still let the individual have his chance to express himself in an improvisational solo,&lt;ref&gt;Kouwenhoven 128&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore asserted the "rugged individualism"&lt;ref&gt;Zelinsky, Wilbur. ''The Cultural Geography of the United States''. Trenton: Prentice Hall. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; that already characterized the nation. Furthermore, jazz began to break down the barrier between performer and audience. It "democratized" culture, making it accessible to the common person.&lt;ref name="Levine 433"&gt;Levine 433&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jazz as modern===
Jazz is distinctly modern in sound and manner. According to Lawrence Levine, "Jazz was, or seemed to be the product of a new age ... raucous, discordant ... accessible, spontaneous ... openly an interactive, participatory music."&lt;ref name="Levine 433"/&gt; Daniel Gregory Mason charged that jazz "is so perfectly adapted to robots that the one could be deduced from the other. Jazz is thus the exact musical reflection of modernist industrial capitalism", and jazz has also been likened to the sound of riveting.&lt;ref&gt;Levine 437&lt;/ref&gt; Irving Berlin called jazz the "music of the machine age."&lt;ref&gt;Whiteman, Paul. "In Defense of Jazz and its Makers." ''The New York Times''. 13 March 1927. pg. SM4.&lt;/ref&gt; Players drew influences from everyday street talk in Harlem, as well as from French Impressionist paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Salamon 256&lt;/ref&gt; The improvised nature begs the player to dismantle and examine pre-existing structure within the music.&lt;ref&gt;Kouwenhoven 127–130&lt;/ref&gt; As tribute to the modernity of jazz, one only needs to examine the various media that drew influences from the music. The musical ''[[Shuffle Along]]'' is one of the earliest and most successful jazz adaptation to the stage,&lt;ref&gt;Huggins 291&lt;/ref&gt; jazz ballets appeared in New York City's Metropolitan Theatre, [[Langston Hughes]] and [[Sterling Allen Brown|Sterling Brown]] drew poetry from the Jazz music they experienced,&lt;ref&gt;Huggins 223&lt;/ref&gt; and jazz music colored the paintings of [[Aaron Douglas]], [[Miguel Covarrubias]], and many others.

There is no single date for the beginning of the modern era in America, as dozens of painters were active at the beginning of the 20th century. It was the time when the first [[cubism|cubist]] landscapes, still-life  and portraits appeared; bright colors entered the palettes of painters, and the first [[Geometric abstraction|non-objective]] paintings were displayed in the galleries.

The modernist movement during the formative years was also becoming popular in New York City by 1913 at the popular Manhattan studio gallery of [[Wilhelmina Weber Furlong]] (1878–1962) and through the work of the Whitney Studio Cub in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;The Biography of Wilhelmina Weber Furlong: The Treasured Collection of Golden Heart Farm by Clint B. Weber, {{ISBN|0-9851601-0-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-9851601-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Professor Emeritus James K. Kettlewell: Harvard, Skidmore College, Curator The Hyde Collection. Foreword to The Treasured Collection of Golden Heart Farm: {{ISBN|0-9851601-0-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-9851601-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Davidson, the beginning of American modernist painting can be dated to the 1910s. The early part of the period lasted 25 years and ended around 1935, when modern art was referred to as, what [[Clement Greenberg|Greenberg]] called the [[avant-garde]].

The 1913 [[Armory Show]] in New York City displayed the contemporary work of European artists, as well as Americans. The [[Impressionist]], [[Fauvist]] and [[Cubist]] paintings startled many American viewers who were accustomed to more conventional art. However, inspired by what they saw, many American artists were influenced by the radical and new ideas.

The early 20th century was marked by the exploration of different techniques and ways of artistic expressiveness. Many American artists like [[Wilhelmina Weber Furlong|Wilhelmina Weber]], [[Man Ray]], [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Gerald Murphy]] and others went to Europe, notably Paris, to make art. The formation of various artistic assemblies led to the multiplicity of meaning in the visual arts. The [[Ashcan School]] gathered around [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] ([[Robert Henri]] or [[George Luks]]); the [[Alfred Stieglitz|Stieglitz]] circle glorified abstract visions of New York City ([[Max Weber (artist)|Max Weber]], [[Abraham Walkowitz]]); color painters evolved in direction of the colorful, abstract "[[Synchromism|synchromies]]" ([[Stanton Macdonald-Wright]] and [[Morgan Russell]]), whereas [[precisionism]] visualized  the industrialized landscape of America in the form of sharp and dynamic geometrization ([[Joseph Stella]], [[Charles Sheeler]], [[Morton Livingston Schamberg]] and [[Charles Demuth]]). Eventually  artists like [[Charles Burchfield]], [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], [[Arthur Dove]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] who was thought of as the mother of American Modernism, [[John Marin]], [[Arthur Beecher Carles]], [[Alfred Henry Maurer]], [[Andrew Dasburg]], [[James Daugherty]], [[John Covert (painter)|John Covert]], [[Henrietta Shore]], [[William Zorach]], [[Marguerite Zorach|Marguerite Thompson]] (Zorach), [[Manierre Dawson]], [[Arnold Friedman]] and [[Oscar Bluemner]] ushered in the era of [[Modernism]] to the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].

The shift of focus and multiplicity of subjects in the visual arts is also a hallmark of American modernist art. Thus, for example, the group [[Ashcan School|The Eight]] brought the focus on the modern city, and placed emphasis on the diversity of different classes of citizens. Two of the most significant representatives of The Eight, Robert Henri and [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]] made paintings about social diversity, often taking as a main subject the slum dwellers of industrialized cities. The late 1920s and the 1930s belonged (among many others) to two movements in American painting, [[Regionalism (art)|Regionalism]] and [[Social Realism]]. The regionalists focused on the colorfulness of the American landscape and the complexities of country life, whereas the social realists went into the subjects of the [[Great Depression]], poverty, and social injustice. The social realists protested against the government and the establishment that appeared hypocritical, biased, and indifferent to the matters of human inequalities. Abstraction, landscape and music were popular modernist themes during the first half of the 20th century. Artists like Charles Demuth who created his masterpiece ''I Saw The Figure Five in Gold'' in 1928, [[Morton Schamberg]] (1881–1918) and [[Charles Sheeler]] were closely related to the [[Precisionism|Precisionist movement]] as well. Sheeler typically painted cityscapes and industrial architecture as exemplified by his painting ''Amoskeag Canal'' 1948. [[Jazz]] and music were improvisationally represented by [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], as exemplified by ''Hot Still-Scape for Six Colors – 7th Avenue Style,'' from 1940.

Modernism bridged the gap between the art and a socially diverse audience in the U.S. A growing number of museums and galleries aimed at bringing modernity to the general public. Despite initial resistance to the celebration of progress, technology, and urban life, the visual arts contributed enormously to the self-consciousness and awareness of the American people. New modernist painting shined a light on the emotional and psychic states of the audience, which was fundamental to the formation of an American identity.

Numerous directions of American "modernism" did not result in one coherent style, but evoked the desire for experiments and challenges. It proved that modern art goes beyond fixed principles.

====Modernist painting====
{{main|Modernism|History of painting|Western painting}}
[[Georgia O'Keeffe]], known as the "Mother of American modernism", has been a major figure in American Modernism since the 1920s. She has received widespread recognition, for challenging the boundaries of modern American artistic style. She is chiefly known for paintings of flowers, rocks, shells, animal bones and landscapes in which she synthesized abstraction and representation. ''Ram's Head White Hollyhock and Little Hills,'' from 1935 is a well known painting by O'Keeffe.
[[Image:O'Keeffe Georgia Ram's Head.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Georgia O'Keeffe]], ''Ram's Head White Hollyhock and Little Hills,'' 1935]]
[[Image:Me and the Moon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Arthur Dove]], ''Me and the Moon'' 1937]]
[[Arthur Dove]] used a wide range of media, sometimes in unconventional combinations to produce his abstractions and his abstract landscapes. ''Me and the Moon'' from 1937 is a good example of an Arthur Dove abstract landscape and has been referred to as one of the culminating works of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaa.si.edu/publications/essay-prize/2012-essay-prize-jennifer-stettler-parsons|title=2012 Essay Prize: Jennifer Stettler Parsons|first=Emily D.|last=Shapiro|date=8 January 2012|website=si.edu|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dove did a series of experimental collage works in the 1920s.  He also experimented with techniques, combining paints like hand mixed oil or tempera over a wax emulsion.

African-American painter [[Aaron Douglas]] (1899–1979) is one of the best-known and most influential African-American modernist painters. His works contributed strongly to the development of an aesthetic movement that is closely related to distinct features of African-American heritage and culture. Douglas influenced African-American visual arts especially during the [[Harlem Renaissance]].

One of Douglas' most popular paintings is ''The Crucifixion''. It was published in James Weldon Johnson's ''God's Trombones'' in 1927. The crucifixion scene that is depicted in the painting shows several elements that constitute Douglas' art: clear-cut delineation, change of shadows and light, stylized human bodies and geometric figures as concentric circles in contrast to linear forms. The painting's theme resembles not only the biblical scene but can also be seen as an allusion to African-American religious tradition: the oversized, dark Jesus is bearing his cross, his eyes directed to heaven from which light is cast down onto his followers. Stylized Roman soldiers are flanking the scene with their pointed spears. As a result, the observer is reminded for instance of the African-American gospel tradition but also of a history of suppression. [[Beauford Delaney]], [[Charles Alston]], [[Jacob Lawrence]] and [[Romare Bearden]] were also important [[African-American]] [[Modernist]] painters that inspired generations of artists that followed them.

====Modernist photography====

{{See also|Photo-Secession}}
At the beginning of American modernism, photography still struggled to be recognized as a form of art. The photographer [[Alfred Stieglitz]] described it as: "Artists who saw my earlier photographs began to tell me that they envied me; that they felt my photographs were superior to their paintings, but that, unfortunately, photography was not an art. I could not understand why the artists should envy me for my work, yet, in the same breath, decry it because it was machine-made." (Stieglitz:8). In 1902, Stieglitz founded the [[Photo-Secession]] group with members such as [[Edward Steichen]], [[Gertrude Käsebier]] and [[Clarence Hudson White]], which had the objective of raising the standard and increasing the awareness of art photography. At that point, their main style was ''[[pictorialist]]'', which was known for modifying photos through soft focus, special filters or exotic printing processes, to imitate the style of paintings and etchings of that time. For means of publication, Stieglitz, as the driving force of the movement, started the magazine ''[[Camera Work]]'', in which he published artists he felt represented the movement. He also ran three galleries one after another, namely "291" (1905–1917), "The Intimate Gallery" (1925–1929) and "An American Place" (1929–1947). Especially 291 served as a meeting point for artists and writers and was the first to exhibit the early modernist art works of European artists, such as [[Henri Matisse]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Paul Cézanne]], and [[Pablo Picasso]], in the United States. A further link to the European avant-garde was established by [[Man Ray]]. Born in America and inspired by the work he saw in Stieglitz' galleries, Ray emigrated to Paris in 1921 and together with artists of the European [[Dada]] and [[Surrealist]] movements created new photographic techniques such as [[rayographs]] (placing objects directly on photosensitive paper).

In the early 1920s, photographers moved towards what they called ''[[straight photography]]''. In contrast to the pictorialist style, they now rejected any kind of manipulation in the photographic process (e.g., soft lens, special developing or printing methods) and tried to use the advantages of the camera as a unique medium for capturing reality. Their motifs were supposed to look as objective as possible. Turning the focus away from classic portraiture and the pictorialist style, the photographers started using their pictures as means for representing the harsh realities of everyday life, but at the same time tried to search for the beauty in the detail or the overall aesthetical structure. Machines and factory work, sky scrapers and technical innovations became prominent motifs.
In 1932 some younger photographers (e.g. [[Ansel Adams]], [[Imogen Cunningham]], [[Willard Van Dyke]], [[Edward Weston]]) started [[Group f/64]] based on the ideals of straight photography, which became the most progressive association of its time.

==Feminism, gender, and sexuality==

===Development of feminism===
Starting from the early 19th century, some women used the doctrines of the ideal femaleness to avoid the isolation of the domestic sphere. By the 1830s, women were openly challenging the women's sphere and demanding greater political, economic and social rights. They formed women's clubs and benevolent societies all over the U.S. Male domination of the public arena was no longer within acceptable limits to many of these middle-class activist women. Beginning with the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] in 1848, American feminists held state and national conventions until the early 20th century. Some spokeswomen of the feminist movement connected the feminist cause with free love and the sexual revolution, which were the taboo issues of the [[Victorian Age]]. Therefore, feminists in both Britain and the United States concentrated on political and legal issues, the vote in particular, and other important women's issues regarding the domestic roles of women and the organization of domestic life in general. Eventually, after a long and hard struggle that included massive, sometimes violent protests, the imprisonment of many women, and even some deaths, the battle for [[women's suffrage]] was won. The suffrage law was passed in the United States in 1920 for women who were householders or wives of householders and in 1928 for all adult women. (African-American women were not included. They only received the right to vote in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1960s.) The [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) was founded in 1966 by a group of feminists. The largest women's rights group in the U.S. NOW aimed to end sexual discrimination, especially in the workplace, by means of legislative lobbying, litigation, and public demonstrations. The following years of the late 20th century witnessed a great expansion of women's rights in all areas of the modern society.
Modernist artists had an ambivalent attitude towards feminism: on the one hand they opted for equal treatment of men and women with regard to law, franchise, and professions; on the other hand they still had the perceived female inadequacies in terms of biology, culture, and transcendence in mind. As the radical feminist [[Emma Goldman]] proclaimed, "true liberation begins neither at the polls nor in courts [but rather] in a woman's soul" (qtd. in Lyon 223).

===Gender and sexuality===
The roles of gender and sexuality in American modernism were elaborated through studies of national identity and citizenship, racial identity and race politics, queer identity and aesthetics, magazine culture, visual culture, market economies, and historical accounts of 20th century political modernity. Immense work done by scholars of feminism, gender, and sexuality helped to restructure the field of American modernist scholarship. Women writers have become the subjects of extensive literary study. Gay and lesbian communities have been revalued as patterns of modern aesthetic experimentation, and sexual identity and gender formation were interpreted in a new way.

The turn of the 20th century cultural life saw a shift to a dichotomy of mass culture versus high culture, with the former generally thought feminine, and high culture thought male-oriented. Formerly denounced popular fiction now served the feminist purpose. "It formed the bedrock for defenses of a new phase of free love and the concomitant promotion of birth control." (Lyon 225)

The upcoming interest in popular psychology, especially [[Freudian]] theories, encouraged this new approach to gender roles and sexuality in the arts. Sexual difference was portrayed by women themselves with the help of the media available to them. This manifested itself for example in [[Mina Loy]]'s "sex-talk" which is "stunning both for the focus it places on a woman's sexual disappointment and for the balance it strikes between clinical frankness and poetic indirection" (Lyon 225). It also entailed the breaking up of traditional gender roles. They were no longer exclusively male or female but there was also an acknowledgment of homosexuality, feminine men, and masculine women. Thus the concept of sexuality became multi-layered, as in [[Djuna Barnes]]' novel ''Nightwood'' (1936) in which she obliterates all established ideas of gender and sexuality. This early debate dealing with these issues cleared the way for contemporary approaches to gender, for instance that of [[Judith Butler]] in her book ''[[Gender Trouble]]'' (1990).

==American icons in the European mind==

===Definition of "American icon"===

This section focuses on people and objects that represent American modernism. Generally speaking, these famous human beings and well-known objects are called ''icons'' since, apart from radiating an aura of uniqueness as well as originality (cf. Wagner 2006: 121.), they sparked public interest in this period and have had a lasting influence on future generations (cf. Czech 2006: 27–28). Thus, they serve as focal points for collective memory or identity at present (cf. ibid.). Even some people in Europe still recognize them as symbols of American modernism.

The medial/public depiction lays the foundation stone for the creation of icons. In this way, a certain image of a biological person or a real object (''signifier'') is produced and becomes the ''signified'' (cf. Volkmann 2006: 94–96). The emanated ''configuration of signs'' (cf. ibid. 96) helps turn ''the signified'' into an icon, if it captures the atmosphere of a particular period/country and is acknowledged by contemporary societies as well as future generations.

===New York City===

''To read more about New York City, please see [[New York City]]''

New York City is one of the most iconic cities in the United States and one of the major global cities of the world due to its important business, financial, trading and cultural organizations, such as Wall Street, United Nations, the Metropolitan Museum of Arts and Broadway theaters with their (in that time innovative) electric lighting. It is regarded as the birthplace of many American cultural movements, including the Harlem Renaissance in literature and [[abstract expressionism]] in visual art.

New York City is iconic not only for Americans, but also for many Europeans as the city of melting pot where many ethnic groups live, often in specific neighborhoods, such as Chinatown, Little Italy. In American modernism, New York became the first stop for immigrants seeking a better life. The city's population boomed, 5 boroughs were formed, the New York City Subway was opened and became a symbol of progress and innovation. The city saw construction of skyscrapers in the skyline.

"Take New York City skyline, for example – that ragged man-made Sierra at the eastern edge of the continent. Clearly, in the minds of immigrants and returning travelers, in the iconography of the admen who use it as a backdrop for the bourbon and airplane luggage they are selling, the eyes of poets and of military strategies, it is one of the prime symbols" (Kouwenhoven 1998: 124). Iconic is especially the Manhattan skyline and its structural properties. It is regarded as a symbol of American progress and competition in height, creativity of structure, advancement and efficiency. It is considered an icon of "architectural individualism" (cf. ibid.  125). The typical gridiron pattern of the city's streets  is an icon of simplicity (cf. ibid 127), while vertical steel construction of many stories is an icon of progress and innovation.

====Charlie Chaplin====
[[Charlie Chaplin]] is regarded as a film icon. Born in London, and while not a U.S. citizen, he had a strong sense of belonging to American society. Chaplin became famous after starring in his first film, ''[[Making a Living]],'' (1914). As a 10-year-old boy "he worked as a mime on the British vaudeville circuit".&lt;ref&gt;(Douglas 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that he was once very poor inspired his Tramp's trademark. He created a distorted version of a formal dinner suit (as a symbol of an adult man personified) combined with the attitude of an innocent child.

He was the first and the last person who was in charge of every aspect of making his films. He started his own film studio [[United Artists]]; was in charge of directing, writing, editing, producing and casting the films in which he played. It is said that he changed the film industry into an art form in the first decades of the 20th century. It was his personality, and his genius with "expressive grace", "endless inventiveness" and creativity that made him an American icon&lt;ref name="ibid"&gt;(ibid.).&lt;/ref&gt; He preferred making silent films, (he made more than 75 silent films) setting the acting and the plot in the center of the action. His best known films are ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940), ''[[Monsieur Verdoux]]'' (1947), ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'' (1952), ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]'' (1921), ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' (1925), ''[[The Circus (film)|The Circus]]'' (1928), ''[[City Lights]]'' (1931) and ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'' (1936)&lt;ref name="cf. ibid"&gt;(cf. ibid.).&lt;/ref&gt;

He was so highly recognizable that a movement of "Chaplinitis" was formed by 1920. There were Chaplin songs, dances, comic books, dolls, and cocktails. Poems were written about him and his pantomime. The [[Beat Generation]] (of writers) made him one of its icons. In the '80s IBM took the Tramp for the logo in their advertisements of personal computers&lt;ref name="cf. ibid"/&gt;

"Every few weeks, outside the movie theater in virtually any American town in the late 1910s, stood the life-size cardboard figure of a small tramp—outfitted in tattered, baggy pants, a cutaway coat and vest, impossibly large, worn-out shoes and a battered derby hat—bearing the inscription ''I AM HERE TODAY".'' "The endearing figure of his [[Little Tramp]] was instantly recognizable around the globe and brought laughter to millions. Still is. Still does"&lt;ref name="ibid"/&gt;

During the McCarthy era he was attacked and condemned by some for the increasingly politicized messages of his films; and he was accused of "anti-American activities" and of being a suspected communist supporter. He maintained his British citizenship, and after a trip to England in 1952 and for many years he wasn't allowed to re-enter the U.S. Finally in 1972 he triumphantly returned and was awarded an honorary [[Academy Award|Oscar]]. He is perceived today as an American film icon due to the charm and brilliance of his films.

===The Model-T Ford===

Icons are usually capable of conveying, on the one hand, awareness of tradition and, on the other hand, the notion of progress (cf. www.ikonothek.de). At this point, it is worth mentioning some concepts of modernism in the U.S., namely ''the sense of forward-looking contemporaneity'' (Wilk 2006: 2) ''the be-lief in the power and potential of the machine and industrial technology'' (ibid. 3) and the emphasis on ''process'' (Kouwenhoven 1998: 133–136).  All these aspects can be associated with the 1913 Model-T Ford. By using assembly-line systems, ''Henry Ford and his men applied continuous-process principles'' (Strasser 1989: 6) during its production. What should be mentioned, in this context, is the fact many unskilled immigrants were employed by the expanded Ford factory in order to meet the increasing demand for this material icon of American modernism on the emerging mass market. In consequence, the foreign workers' contribution also underscored the myth of ''The American Melting Pot'' (see also: Meyer 1998).

Today, the Model-T Ford continues to represent the idea of process and mobility. Therefore, although modernism aimed at rejecting any form of tradition and history, this icon transmits, up to a certain degree, a sense of tradition.

==Everyday life and culture==

The modernist movement caused vast changes in societies in which it took place. With the introduction of industrial developments, the American people started to enjoy the outcome of the new modernist era. Everyday life and culture are the areas that reflected the social change in the habits of the society. Developments that occurred with modernism influenced American people life standards and gave way to new style of living.

Widespread use of electricity and mass production of technological house appliances like refrigerator brought about the change of eating habits of American people. Use of frozen food became more common. After the war &lt;!--WHICH WAR?--&gt; the U.S. government passed new laws concerning food. So some new foods came right out of the ration kits to the stores. "Foods formerly manufactured solely for army use were put on the civilian market", Frozen and dried food products also became popular after the war. National Research Corporation of Boston introduced frozen orange juice concentrate called "tang." The company became Minute Maid, and, by 1950, a quarter of Florida's orange crop was going into concentrates. The frozen product quickly overtook fresh squeezed orange juice in most American homes. Full frozen meals were not far behind. In the 1950s, a Nebraska company Swanson's brought out their TV Dinners to great success.

These changes in eating habits caused huge changes in appliances, transportation and farming. Since people began buying the new products, new refrigerators were quickly developed with bigger freezer sections Shock resistant refrigerator units for trucks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe40s/money_14.html |title=A Revolution in Transportation for Agriculture during the 1940s |publisher=Livinghistoryfarm.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; had to be invented and used by the military before frozen products could distributed and marketed around the country and around the world. These developments forced farmers to change what they grew and how they grew their products to meet new consumer demands.

In the following are there a few of the foods that were first produced and sold in the 1940s.

– Mrs. Paul's frozen fish sticks&lt;br /&gt;
– Cheerios (first sold as Cheeri Oats, the first ready-to-eat oat cereal) and Kellogg's Raisin Bran&lt;br /&gt;
– Minute Rice&lt;br /&gt;
– Reddi-Whip whipped cream&lt;br /&gt;
– Nestles Quick powdered drink mix&lt;br /&gt;
– Packaged cake mixes&lt;br /&gt;
– M&amp;Ms Chocolate Candies, Peppermint Patty, Junior Mints, Almond Joy, Whoppers malted milk balls, Jolly Rancher Candies&lt;br /&gt;
– Deep Dish Pizza (Pizzeria Uno, Chicago)

With the increasing number of automobiles, American people started to get out of their homes and had dinner outside. However, during the war &lt;!--WHICH WAR?--&gt; people drove their cars as little as possible. Gas and tires were limited by the government. Car production ceased as factories had to manufacture tanks, Jeeps and other military vehicles. After the war families piled into cars again, as a consequence, new highways were built. The number of drive-ins  increased immediately. Drive-ins became part of the social life in America by the end of 1940.

Modernism showed its effects nearly in all areas. One of the immense developments was to supply the rural areas with the electricity. The REA, Rural Electrification Administration, began in the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe30s/life_08.html |title=Bringing Electricity in Rural America |publisher=Livinghistoryfarm.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it took time to build power lines scores of miles into rural areas. Throughout the 1940s, the REA continued to build the electricity lines.

Electricity changed the lives of farm families, from the moment they got up early in the morning, through meals, chores, and work until they went to bed at night. Electricity brought power for lights to work, read, and sew at night; power for appliances like refrigerators and freezers to preserve food; power for small kitchen devices such as mixers and blenders; and power for other labor saving devices such as electric stoves, irons and clothes washers. Electricity brought changes that just made life safer and better – like colored lights instead of dangerous candles on Christmas trees, refrigerators to keep food fresh and electric fans to bring relief on a hot summer day.
 
:In 1930, only 13 percent of farms had electricity.
:By the early 1940s, only 33 percent of farms had electricity.
:Locally in York, Nebraska, the Perennial Public Power District had strung nearly 250 miles of electric line to more than 500 customers by September 1945.
:By 1950 nearly all of Nebraska farms were "hooked up", and electricity replaced kerosene lanterns in homes and barns.

There were some crucial steps taken in the communication and media devices like the invention of radio and television.

Radio was the nation's first mass medium, linking the country and ending the isolation of rural residents. Radio was so important that the 1930 Census asked if the household had a radio. Radio provided free entertainment (after you bought the radio) and connected country people to world events. Walter Winchell and Lowell Thomas were popular news commentators on the radio.

:Families laughed at comedians Jack Benny, Fred Allen, George Burns and Gracie Allen, Amos and Andy, and Fibber McGee and Molly.
:Radio featured daytime soap operas.
:In the evening, people listened to the Lone Ranger, the Green Hornet, The Shadow, and Jack Armstrong.
:Singers Bing Crosby and the Mills Brothers, as well as Guy Lombardo's orchestra and the Grand Ole Opry were popular.
:Families listened to baseball, cheering for stars like Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio. Nearly 40 million people listened to the horserace between Seabiscuit and War Admiral in Maryland.
:In news coverage, the German airship Hindenburg caught fire in 1937 as it landed in New Jersey. Thousands of people across the country heard Herb Morrison describe the terrifying scene on live radio, saying "Oh the humanity!"

The first practical TV sets were demonstrated and sold to the public at the 1939 World's Fair in New York. The sets were very expensive and New York City had the only broadcast station. When World War II started, all commercial production of television equipment was banned. Production of the cathode ray tubes that produced the pictures was redirected to radar and other high tech war uses. After the war television was something few had heard of. That changed quickly. In 1945, a poll asked Americans, "Do you know what television is?" Most didn't. But four years later, most Americans had heard of television and wanted one! According to one survey in 1950, before they got a TV, people listened to radio an average of nearly five hours a day. Within nine months after they bought a TV they listened to radio, but only for two hours a day. They watched TV for five hours a day. The 1940s TVs didn't look like today's televisions. Most had picture screens between 10 and 15&amp;nbsp;inches wide diagonally, inside large, heavy cabinets. And, of course, color broadcasts and sets didn't arrive until much later, in 1954.

===Fashion===

''For a further, more formal account, please see [[Fashion]]''

Referring to fashion, usually one would think of dressing styles or costumes. Of course, dressing style is a very important category of the word "fashion". On the other hand, "fashion" has more meanings and could be explained and found in many other fields, such as architecture, body type, dance and music, and even forms of speech, etc.

'''1. Costumes'''

In the early 1920s, the ready-to-wear fashion began to spread America. More women earned their own wages and didn't want to spend time on fittings. Fashion as the status symbol was no more important as class distinctions were becoming blurred. People especially women called for inexpensive fashion. In the aspect of mass production of contemporary style clothing for women, America went ahead of other countries. Several designers of this fashion including [[Jane Derby]] made a stage pose.

'''''Women:''''' By 1921 the longer skirt, which was usually long and uneven at the bottom was out of date. The short skirt became popular by 1925. No bosom, no waistline, and hair nearly hidden under a cloche hat. The manufacturing of cosmetics also began from this decade. Powder, lipstick, rouge, eyebrow pencil, eye shadow, colored nails, women had them all. Moreover, pearls came in fashion as well.

'''''Men:''''' In this period, clothing for men was more conservative. Trousers widened to 24&amp;nbsp;inches at the bottoms. Knickers, increased the width and length, were called ''plus fours''. In summer, white linen was popular, while in the winter an American coat—the raccoon coat—was in fashion. The slouch hat, made of felt, could be rolled up and packed into a suitcase. These were very popular with college men.

'''2. Furniture'''
There's no pure American modern style in the designing world.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} The American modern artists inherited the style characterized by simplicity of form, absence of decorative ornament, and focused on functional concerns from their precedents. At the same time, the American designers blended the wild style of Parisian painting, as well as the features of modern architecture in their works, such as Art Deco. Moreover, the designers also placed much emphasis on the materials, especially those invented in the modern age.

==American modernist literature==

American modernist literature was a dominant trend in American literature between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. The modernist era highlighted innovation in the form and language of poetry and prose, as well as addressing numerous contemporary topics, such as race relations, gender and the human condition. Many American modernists became expatriated in Europe during this time, often becoming stalwarts in the European movement, as was the case for [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Ezra Pound]] and [[Gertrude Stein]]. These writers were often known as The Lost Generation.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, David, and David C. Ward. "Lighting Out for the Territories: American Expatriates, Paris, and Modernism". ''The Sewanee Review'' 105.3 (1997): 423–427. Web ...&lt;/ref&gt;

As a reaction to this trend, many American authors and poets began a trend of 'nativism', seeking to represent the modern American experience in America. Notable contributors to this trend include [[William Carlos Williams]], [[Wallace Stevens]] and [[Marianne Moore]]. These poets were often critical of the works of expatriate writers such as Eliot and Pound, as evidenced by poems like [[Spring and All]].

Influenced by the first World War, many American modernist writers explored the psychological wounds and spiritual scars of the war experience. The economic crisis in America at the beginning of the 1930s also left a mark on literature, such as [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''. A related issue is the loss of self and need for self-definition, as workers faded into the background of city life, unnoticed cogs within a machine yearning for self-definition. American modernists echoed the mid-19th-century focus on the attempt to "build a self"—a theme illustrated by Fitzgerald's ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''. Madness and its manifestations seems to be another favorite modernist theme, as seen in [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[The Emperor Jones]]'', Hemingway's ''[[The Battler]]'' and Faulkner's ''[[That Evening Sun]]''. Nevertheless, all these negative aspects led to new hopes and aspirations, and to the search for a new beginning, not only for the contemporary individuals, but also for the fictional characters in American modernist literature.

Modernist literature also allowed for the development of regional trends within American literature, including the [[Harlem Renaissance]] and southern modernism. The Harlem Renaissance marked a rebirth for African American arts, centralized in the Harlem area of New York. Writers and thinkers such as [[Alain LeRoy Locke|Alain Locke]], [[Claude McKay]], [[Langston Hughes]] and [[Zora Neale Hurston]] were among the key figures of the movement. The movement was connected to a vogue for African American culture, as seen too in the popularity of Jazz music, with many writers financed by white patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c250.columbia.edu/dkv/tools/0746/web/s5/s5_2.html|title=The Rise of Consumer Culture|author=|date=|website=c250.columbia.edu|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many writers of this movement used modernist techniques to represent African American life, for instance incorporating the rhythms of Jazz music and dialects of African American culture into poetry and prose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1989/1/89.01.05.x.html|title=89.01.05: The Impact of the Music of the Harlem Renaissance on Society|author=|date=|website=www.yale.edu|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southern modernism similarly represented the life and unique experiences of the South using modernist aesthetics, with celebrated figures including [[William Faulkner]] and [[Tennessee Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=cCd5woijF3oC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=southern+modernism&amp;ots=i3fI7E7gdW&amp;sig=TmTRKhphg0zFspnrdCfeIbUBfr0&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Nation's Region: Southern Modernism, Segregation, and U.S. Nationalism|first=Leigh Anne|last=Duck|date=10 April 2018|publisher=University of Georgia Press|accessdate=10 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The new criticism in America===

From the 1930s to the 1960s, [[New Criticism]] became a critical force in the United States. It was the most powerful perspective in American literary criticism. The representatives were [[John Crowe Ransom]], [[Allen Tate]], [[Cleanth Brooks]], [[Robert Penn Warren]]. "The influential critical methods these poet-professors developed emphasized the sharpening of close reading skills. New Criticism privileged the evaluation of poetry as the justification of literary scholarship". ''Brooks and Warren's Understanding Poetry'' (1938) became one of the most influential college poetry textbooks of the 1930s and was revised and reprinted well into the 1970s. (Morrisson: 29).

New criticism showed itself in such works as [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]]'s and [[Yeats]]' poems. "Poetry that best fit the aesthetic criteria of the New Critics was emphasized in important classroom teaching anthologies" (Morrisson: 29).
T. S. Eliot redefined tradition in his essay "Tradition and the Individual Talent". He formulated such critical concepts as "objective correlative", and rethought the literary canon in his elevation of Jacobean drama and metaphysical poetry. His work had a fundamental influence on New Criticism in America.

==Architecture and space==

The United States played a great role in the modernism movement concerning new advanced building and construction technologies.
Among construction innovations there are such materials as iron, steel and reinforced concrete.
Brooklyn Bridge by John and Washington Roebling (1869–1883) (for more details see [[John Roebling]]/Washington Roebling)

[[Louis Henry Sullivan]] headed the so-called Chicago school of architecture, which was distinct by its development of functional design along with modern materials. Sullivan's follower [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] absorbed from his 'lieber Master' (dear master) the German romantic tradition of organic architecture. He developed a new and original approach to residential design before World War I, which became known as the "prairie style." It combined open planning principles with horizontal emphasis, asymmetrical facade elevations, and broad, sheltering roofs. Robie House in Chicago (1909) and the Guggenheim Museum in New York City (1946–59) are two of his seminal works.

In his works Wright moved closer and closer to an earth-bound sense of natural form, using rough-hewn stone and timber and aiming always in his houses to achieve an effect of intimate and protective shelter.

Foreign-born architects as [[Richard Neutra]], [[Rudolph Schindler (architect)|Rudolf Schindler]], and [[William Lescaze]] during the 1920s played a great role in development of American architecture performing later a style, which got the name of [[International style (architecture)|international style]] and was reflected in the design of corporate office buildings after World War II. Such buildings as Skidmore, Owings and Merrill's Lever House (1952) and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building (1956–58) in New York City are the examples of this new style. When such famous Europeans as [[Walter Gropius]] and  [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] immigrated to the United States, many American architectural schools went under the influence of the traditions of the [[Bauhaus]] in Germany.

Athens Biennale is one of the largest [[contemporary art]] exhibitions held every two years in [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. It is organised by the Athens Biennale Non-Profit Organization, which was founded in November 2005 by Xenia Kalpaktsoglou, Poka-Yio, and Augustine Zenakos.

Athens Biennale functions within an international network of large-scale periodic contemporary art events. It emerged from the intense cultural activity that makes Athens one of the most interesting places for contemporary art, and it aims to be an agent of constant change and innovation, provide a context for creativity and dialogue and constitute a wide platform for the designation and the critical engagement of local artistic production, as well as a forum for discussion and exchange with the international scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://athensbiennale.org/en/|title=Athens Biennale|website=athensbiennale.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has presented so far five editions: "Destroy Athens" (2007), "Heaven" (2009), "Monodrome" (2011), "Agora" (2013), "Omonoia" (June 2015-February 2017), as well as the prelude of AB6 "Waiting for the Barbarians" (April 2017). AB launches its 6th edition, under the title ANTI, on October 26, 2018, curated by Stefanie Hessler/ Kostis Stafylakis/ Poka-Yio.

Athens Biennale is internationally acknowledged and awarded (by the European Cultural Foundation) for its forward-looking and often controversial productions that challenge fixed notions of how contemporary art should be exhibited, what art interventions in the "public space" should be and how a major art production could be collectively co-created.

== History ==
The first Biennale, entitled ''Destroy Athens'' was held at Technopolis of Athens in 2007 and focused [[on avant-garde]] creations of contemporary art with participating artists from Greece and abroad.&lt;ref name="e-flux destroy"&gt;[http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/destroy-athens/ Destroy Athens], e-flux.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second one, entitled ''HEAVEN'',  took place in June 2009, at former [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] venues at Palaio Faliro with the participation of 120 international artists.&lt;ref name="e-flux heaven"&gt;[http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/heaven/ HEAVEN], e-flux.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third Athens Biennale, entitled ''MONODROME'', was curated by [[Nicolas Bourriaud]] along with Kalpaktsoglou and Poka-Yio at the building of Diplareios School Square Theatre, Athens.&lt;ref name="e-flux mono"&gt;[http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/3rd-athens-biennale-2011/ MONODROME], e-flux.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 4th Biennale ==
[[File:AthensBiennale AB4 AGORA Logo Web-200x135.png|thumb|4th Athens Biennale 2013 AGORA logo]]
The fourth Athens Biennale, entitled ''AGORA'', was held in the former [[Athens Stock Exchange]] building in [[Sofokleous Street]] between September 28 - December 1 2013 and it featured works by [[George Harvalias]], [[FYTA]], Theo Prodromidis and [[Hito Steyerl]] among others.&lt;ref name="agora press"&gt;[http://us7.campaign-archive2.com/?u=a15ac04c853c529f20d5f4f92&amp;id=531528e23c&amp;e=%5BUNIQID AGORA], 4th Athens Biennale 2013 AGORA official press release &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Drake, Cathryn.

Retrieved 2017-05-13.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Athens Biennale was awarded the [[ECF Princess Margriet Award For Culture]] for Agora's innovative collective curatorial approach that broke from a consumer-oriented model of exhibition-making. &lt;ref name="ECF Princess Margriet Award For Culture Awarded To Athens Biennale (Greece)."&gt;[http://www.biennialfoundation.org/2015/03/ecf-princess-margriet-award-for-culture-awarded-to-athens-biennale-greece/], Biennale Foundation "ECF Princess Margriet Award For Culture Awarded To Athens Biennale (Greece)." &lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Their collaborative process in producing the exhibition reflects on the way a [[biennale]] operates. The 4th Athens Biennale (AB4) proposed AGORA as a place of exchange and interaction, and as an ideal setting for critique.&lt;ref name="NeMe.org"&gt;[http://news.neme.org/1597/4th-athens-biennale-2013 4th Athens Biennalle 2013 AGORA], NeMe.org.&lt;/ref&gt; AB4 was realized by a nameless and ephemeral group of artists, curators, theorists and practitioners in the creative industries.&lt;ref name="agora team"&gt;[http://athensbiennale.org/en/agora_en/ab4-team/ 4th Athens Biennalle 2013 AGORA curatorial team], 4th Athens Biennalle 2013 AGORA official website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''baldachin of Ribes''' ({{lang-ca|baldaquí de Ribes}}) is a fragmentary [[baldachin|altar-canopy]] in the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque style]] now in the [[Museu Episcopal de Vic|Episcopal Museum of Vic]]. It is the masterpiece of the so-called "Ripoll workshop" (''taller de Ripoll''). It dates to the second quarter of the twelfth century. The surviving fragment is only one fourth the size of the original, which contained a central [[mandorla]] with the figure of Christ and four angels on each side.

The style of the baldachin shows strong south French influence, and borrows many features from the tympanum of [[Moissac Abbey]], especially in the robes of Christ. The robes of the angels, however, and the hairstyles of all the figures are more typically Iberian.&lt;ref&gt;Walter W. S.

[[Image:Jade Bi Ornament, Dragon designs, China - Warring States period, Western Han dynasty, 4th-2nd century BC.tiff|thumb|A Western Han dynasty Bi, with dragon designs.]]
The '''bi''' is a type of circular ancient [[Chinese jade]] artifact. The earliest ''bi'' were produced in the [[Neolithic]] period, particularly by the [[Liangzhu culture]] ([[3400 BC|3400]]–[[2250 BCE]]).&lt;ref name="nga.gov"&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/education/chinatp_sl03.shtm Teaching Chinese Archaeology, object 3 - NGA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508040340/http://www.nga.gov/education/chinatp_sl03.shtm |date=May 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later examples date mainly from the [[Shang Dynasty|Shang]], [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] and [[Han Dynasty|Han]] dynasties. They were also made in [[Ancient Chinese glass|glass]].

==Description==
A ''bi'' is a flat jade disc with a circular hole in the centre. Neolithic ''bi'' are undecorated, while those of later periods of China, like the Zhou dynasty, bear increasingly ornate surface carving (particularly in a hexagonal pattern) whose motifs represented deities associated with the sky (four directions) as well as standing for qualities and powers the wearer wanted to invoke or embody.

As laboriously crafted objects, they testify to the concentration of power and resources in the hands of a small elite.&lt;ref name="nga.gov"/&gt;

==Meaning==
Later traditions associate the ''bi'' with heaven, and the ''[[Cong (jade)|cong]]'' with the earth. Bi disks are consistently found with heaven and earth-like imagery, suggesting that the disk's circular shape also bears symbolic significance as this description explains:

{{quote|It is found that these objects testify to early stages of development of cosmological concepts that remained important in Chinese culture during the Warring States and Han periods: the notion of a covering sky (''gaitian'') that revolves around a central axis, the cycle of the Ten Suns, and the use of an early form of the carpenter's square. These objects were handled by shamans who were the religious leaders of Liangzhu society and the transmitters of cosmological knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shu-P'Ing |first1=Teng |title=The Original Significance of ''Bi'' Disks: Insights Based on Liangzhu Jade ''Bi'' with Incised Symbolic Motifs |journal=Journal of East Asian Archaeology |date=2000 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=165–194 |doi=10.1163/156852300509835}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Function==
[[File:Bi with two dragons and grain pattern.jpg|thumb|Bi disc with a dual dragon motif, [[Warring States period]]]]
The original function and significance of the ''bi'' are unknown, as the Neolithic cultures have left no written history. From these earliest times they were buried with the dead, as a sky symbol, accompanying the dead into the after world or "sky", with the cong which connected the body with the earth.&lt;ref name="nga.gov"/&gt; They were placed ceremonially on the body in the grave of persons of high social status. ''Bi'' are sometimes found near the stomach and chest in neolithic burials.&lt;ref name="nga.gov"/&gt;

Jade, like bi disks, has been used throughout Chinese history to indicate an individual of moral quality, and has also served as an important symbol of rank. They were used in worship and ceremony – as ceremonial items they symbolised the ranks of emperor, king, duke, marquis, viscount, and baron with four different ''[[Gui_(vessel)|Gui]]s'' and two different bi disks.

In war during the Zhou dynasty period (c. 1046–256 BCE), bi disks belonging to the leaders of the defeated forces were handed over to the victor as a sign of submission.

==Influences==
The design of the reverse side of the medals given in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] are based on bi disks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.beijing2008.cn/spirit/beijing2008/graphic/n214070893.shtml Design of the Medal for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080812163040/http://en.beijing2008.cn/spirit/beijing2008/graphic/n214070893.shtml |date=August 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Global spread of the printing press#Italy}}

Germans in [[Subiaco, Lazio|Subiaco]], [[Arnold Pannartz]] and [[Konrad Sweynheim]], in 1464 set up a printing press and produced "the earliest book printed in Italy,...a Latin grammar by [[Aelius Donatus|Donatus]]."{{sfn|Peckham|1940}} Printing technology spread in the 1460s to [[Rome]] and [[Venice]]; in the 1470s to places such as [[Bergamo]], [[Bologna]], [[Brescia]], [[Cremona]], [[Ferrara]], [[Florence]], [[Genoa]], [[Lucca]], [[Mantua]], [[Messina]], [[Milan]], [[Modena]], [[Naples]], [[Padua]], [[Palermo]], [[Parma]], [[Pavia]], [[Perugia]], [[Piacenza]], [[Reggio Calabria]], [[Treviso]], [[Turin]], [[Verona]], [[Vicenza]]; and in the 1480s to places such as [[L'Aquila]], [[Pisa]], [[Reggio Emilia]], [[Siena]], and [[Udine]].{{sfn|Proctor|1898}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://data.cerl.org/istc/_index/imprintplace |title= Index: Place of Publication |work=[[Incunabula Short Title Catalogue]]: the International Database of 15th-century European Printing |publisher=[[British Library]] |accessdate= 3 December 2017 }}. (Searchable by town)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of [[Italian unification]] and the creation of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861, the Biblioteca Magliabechiana in Florence merged with the {{illm|Biblioteca Palatina Lorenese|it}}, and by 1885 became known as the [[Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze]] (National Central Library). The [[Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Roma]] formed in 1876. As official [[Legal_deposit#Italy|legal deposit]] libraries, both maintain copies of works published in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Two National Central Libraries of Florence and Rome |author= Franca Arduini |journal= [[Libraries &amp; Culture]] |volume=25 |jstor=25542277 |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] named [[Turin]] the 2006 [[World Book Capital]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2675">The '''Bucharest Yiddish Studio Theater''' (Yiddish: ''Bukareshter Idishe Teater-Studie'', ''BITS'') was a short-lived, highly experimental [[Yiddish theater]] founded in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]] in 1930, under the leadership of [[Jacob Sternberg]].

Their first production, in January 1930, was [[I.L. Peretz]]'s ''A Night in the Old Town'', also known as ''A Night in the Old Marketplace'' &amp;mdash; that is to say, in the [[Jew]]ish [[ghetto]]. ''Dimineaţa'' said of this play that it "does not have a subject in the conventional sense of the word" but is instead "the dream of a cold night", moving smoothly between the world of the living and that of the dead. The play was a hit and a critical success. [[Tudor Arghezi]], who did not speak [[Yiddish]], praised Sternberg highly for the production, and for the structure of the performance, whose blend of "order and disorder" he described as "inexplicable, like [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s music". 

Arghezi also remarked of ''A Night in the Old Town'', "you are either open to this, or you are not". Many were not. [[Barbu Lăzăreanu]], a prominent Jewish intellectual and [[ethnology|ethnologist]], said that BITS "altered the Peretz's work into an orgy of ''orori osifere'' [roughly, 'graveyard horrors'] and monosyllabism that creates an unstoppable impression of the lugubrious and hyper-transcendental."

Their subsequent production of [[Sholom Aleichem]]'s ''Der Farkishefter Shnayder'' (''The Bewitched Tailor'') was described by the ''Literarishe Bleter'' of [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]] as "a unified and enchanting spectacle of prose, poetry, and song" incorporating new songs "full of hope", but also music from the [[synagogue]] and popular song, "but on all this it embroiders a sad mirth, realist-simple and demented-symbolist comedy, which ends with optimistic rhymes &amp;mdash; the moral of the comedy &amp;mdash; sung by the comedians themselves."

'''The Dark Watchers''' (also known by early Spanish settlers as '''Los Vigilantes Oscuros''') is a name given to a group of entities in [[California]] [[folklore]] purportedly seen observing travelers along the [[Santa Lucia Mountains]].

==Description==
The Dark Watchers are described as tall, sometimes giant sized featureless dark silhouettes often adorned with brimmed hats or walking sticks.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} They are most often reported to be seen in the hours around [[twilight]] and [[dawn]]. They are said to motionlessly watch travelers from the horizon along the [[Santa Lucia Mountain Range]]. According to legend no one has seen one up close and if someone were to approach them they disappear.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4522|number=522|date=7 June 2016|title=Dark Watchers|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{expand section|date=June 2017}}
While sometimes attributed to the [[Chumash people]] who historically inhabited the central and southern coastal regions of California, nothing analogous to the legend appears to exist in their mythology.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HarringtonBlackburn1975"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrington|first1=John P.|last2=Blackburn|first2=Thomas C.|title=December's Child: A Book of Chumash Oral Narratives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e2lC7XcLrzoC|year=1975|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02930-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Spanish Settlers first moved into the area they were said to have witnessed the Dark Watchers whom they dubbed Los Vigilantes Oscuros.&lt;ref name="independent.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2014/nov/13/search-dark-watchers/|title=In Search of the Dark Watchers|work=[[Santa Barbara Independent]]|date=13 November 2014|first=Mitchell|last= Kriegman}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=May 2018}}

The Dark Watchers are most famously given a brief mention in [[John Steinbeck]]'s "[[Flight (Steinbeck story)|Flight]]", included in the 1938 collection of his short stories, ''[[The Long Valley]]'':
{{quote|"Pepé looked suspiciously back every minute or so, and his eyes sought the tops of the ridges ahead. Once, on a white barren spur, he saw a black figure for a moment; but he looked quickly away, for it was one of the dark watchers. No one knew who the watchers were, nor where they lived, but it was better to ignore them and never to show interest in them. They did not bother one who stayed on the trail and minded his own business."||}}

Along with this, "watchers" are also referenced by poet [[Robinson Jeffers]] in the titular poem of his 1937 collection ''Such Counsels You Gave to Me &amp; Other Poems'':&lt;ref name="JeffersHunt1988"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeffers|first1=Robinson|last2=Hunt|first2=Tim|title=The Collected Poetry of Robinson Jeffers: 1928-1938|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MTn_okYQeW0C&amp;pg=PA562|year=1988|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1723-6|page=562}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weirdca.com/location.php?location=179 |title=Dark Watchers |date=8 May 2007 |last=Parzanese |first=Joe |website=Weird California}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{quote|...he thought it might be one of the watchers, who are often seen in this length of coast-range, forms that look human to human eyes, but certainly are not human. They come from behind ridges to watch. But when he approached it he recognized the shabby clothes and pale hair and even the averted forehead and concave line from the eye to the jaw, so that he was not surprised when the figure turning toward him in the quiet twilight showed his own face. Then it melted and merged into the shadows beyond it...}}
John Steinbeck's son [[Thomas Steinbeck]] would grow up to report having seen The Dark Watchers during his childhood and later along with artist Benjamin Brode collaborate on a book titled ''In Search of the Dark Watchers'', where they go into the history of the legend and interview locals who claim to have seen them, such as famed [[Big Sur]] resident Billy Post.&lt;ref name="Brode2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brode|first=Benjamin|title=In Search of the Dark Watchers: Landscapes and Lore of Big Sur|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WFPioQEACAAJ|date=September 2014|publisher=Studio Brode|isbn=978-0-9906637-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/02/local/me-billy-post2|title=Billy Post dies at 88; Big Sur's resident authority|first=Elaine|last=Woo|date=2 August 2009|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to newspaper archives in the mid-1960s, a Monterery Peninsula local and former high school principal went on a hiking trip in the Santa Lucias when he suddenly spotted a dark figure standing on a rock and surveying the area. When the principal called out to the other hikers, the creature vanished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Biship|first1=Greg|last2=Oesterle|first2=Joe|last3=Marinacci|first3=Mike|title=Weird California|date=March 2, 2006|publisher=Sterling|isbn=9781402766831|pages=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2018}}

==Explanations==

[[Illusion]]s, [[hallucination]]s or misinterpretation of natural stimulus brought on by [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]] or [[solitude|isolation]] have been proposed by psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Graham Reed (psychologist)|Reed, Graham]]. (1988). ''The Psychology of Anomalous Experience''. Prometheus Books. pp. 44-45. {{ISBN|0-87975-435-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Infrasound#Suggested relationship to ghost sightings|Infrasound]], which can be generated by wind, can cause feelings of uneasiness and anxiety in some people and is frequently connected to paranormal sightings.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

An optical illusion known as the [[Brocken spectre]] is a plausible explanation for the legend.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Dave; Mitchell, Ian. (1987). ''Mountain Days and Bothy Nights''. Luath. p. 157. {{ISBN|0-946487-15-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Brocken spectre, "mountain spectre" can occur in certain atmospheric conditions when the sun is at a particular angle. The subject's shadow can be cast onto a cloud bank around them, creating the illusion of a large shadowy humanoid figure.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Helen. (1975). ''Mist, Murk and Visual Perception''. ''[[New Scientist]]''. p. 658. "The Brocken Spectre (where one's shadow cast by the sun onto a cloudbank appears distant and gigantic)... The shadowy image appearing much farther away than it is, and consequently enlarged to a sufficient extent to give rise to such tales as the Grey Man of Ben MacDhui."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Displaying the Body of Saint Bonaventure''''' (French - ''Exposition du corps de saint Bonaventure'') is a 1629 painting by [[Francisco de Zurbarán]], now in the [[Louvre]]. Around the body of [[saint Bonaventure]] are figures including [[James I of Aragon]] and [[Pope Gregory X]], shown in conversation. It formed part of a series of paintings on the saint's life - the other works are ''Saint Bonaventure at the Council of Lyon'' (Louvre), ''Saint Bonaventure and the Angel'' (Dresden) and ''Saint Bonaventure and Saint Thomas Aquinas before a Crucifix'' (Berlin).

'''''Double Negative''''' is a piece of [[land art]] located in the [[Moapa Valley, Nevada|Moapa Valley]] on [[Mormon Mesa]] (or [[Virgin River|Virgin River Mesa]]) near [[Overton, Nevada|Overton]], [[Nevada]]. ''Double Negative'' was completed in 1970 by the artist [[Michael Heizer]].

The work consists of a long trench in the earth, 30 feet (9 m) wide, {{convert|50|ft|m}} deep, and 1500 feet (457 m) long, created by the displacement of 244,000 tons of rock, mostly rhyolite and sandstone. Two trenches straddle either side of a natural canyon (into which the excavated material was dumped). The "negative" in the title thus refers in part to both the natural and man-made [[negative space]] that constitutes the work. The work essentially consists of what is not there, what has been displaced.

In 1969 the art dealer [[Virginia Dwan]] funded the purchase of the 60-acre site for ''Double Negative'' and in turn the artist transferred the property deeds to Dwan. In 1971 Heizer prevented the Dwan Gallery from selling the work. Dwan then donated ''Double Negative'' to the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]] (MoCA) in 1984, with Heizer’s blessing, to coincide with “In Context: Michael Heizer, Geometric Extraction”.&lt;ref&gt;Erica Cooke (September 30, 2011), [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Will-Double-Negative-be-a-no-show/24658 Will Double Negative be a no show?] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the terms of the agreement with the museum is the fact that, according to the artist's wishes, MoCA will undertake no conservation of the piece as Heizer indicated that nature should eventually reclaim the land through weather and erosion.&lt;ref&gt;William Wilson (December 10, 1985), [http://articles.latimes.com/1985-12-10/entertainment/ca-15620_1_land-art New Moca Acquisition Is A Hole In The Ground] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently however he has expressed a contrasting wish to restore the piece, perhaps in opposition to Robert Smithson's support for the principle of entropy.&lt;ref&gt;Dana Goodyear (August 29, 2016) [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/29/michael-heizers-city?kwp_0=221428&amp;kwp_4=845555&amp;kwp_1=416266 A Monument to Outlast Humanity] ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the solo exhibition "In Context: Michael Heizer, Geometric Extraction", MoCA was able to include a photographic panorama of Heizer’s work. For the large-scale, historical survey of land art “Ends of the Earth” at MoCA in 2012, Heizer did not want any representation of Double Negative to be included in the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;Erica Cooke (September 30, 2011), [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Will-Double-Negative-be-a-no-show/24658 Will Double Negative be a no show?] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A good aerial photograph appears in the informative catalog, but Heizer reportedly worried that documentation in a museum gallery misrepresents sculpture that can be known only through physical experience.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Knight (June 3, 2012), [http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/03/entertainment/la-et-knight-land-art-review-20120602 Art review: 'Ends of the Earth' brings Land art indoors] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is currently owned by MoCA and is accessible by [[four-wheel drive]] vehicle or motorcycle.

==Directions==
From Overton, NV follow Mormon Mesa Road to the top of the mesa eastward.  As you come to the top of the mesa, you will pass a cattle guard.  Continue east across the mesa for 2.7 miles.  Do not leave the mesa.  Just before you come to a second cattle guard at the east edge of the mesa, there will be a less-traveled road/path that extends along the rim of the mesa.  Turn left onto this rim trail and follow it north 1.3 miles.

'''Dyke Action Machine!''' or '''DAM!''' is a [[public art]] and [[Activism|activist]] duo made up of [[designer]] [[Carrie Moyer]] and [[photographer]] Sue Schaffner. DAM! gained notoriety in the 1990s for using commercial photography styling with lesbian imagery in public art.

== History ==
Sue Schaffner and Carrie Moyer formed Dyke Action Machine! (DAM!) in 1991 in [[New York City]]. The duo created [[Radical feminism|radical feminist]] [[public art]], putting images of lesbians into commercialized styles and settings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Together with groups like [[Guerrilla Girls|Guerilla Girls]] and Toxic Titties, DAM! resisted [[sexism]] and [[consumerism]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raizada|first=Kristen|date=2007-01-01|title=An Interview with the Guerrilla Girls, Dyke Action Machine (DAM!), and the Toxic Titties|jstor=4317230|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=19|issue=1|pages=39–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; DAM! specifically targeted [[lesbophobia]], the marginalization of lesbians not only in favor of heterosexuality but also within LGBT circles, where Schaffner and Moyer saw the male homosexual as privileged.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; DAM! has been described as intentionally pluralistic, embracing many identities and issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=Tram|date=2013|title=From SlutWalks to SuicideGirls: Feminist Resistance in the Third Wave and Postfeminist Era|jstor=23611512|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|volume=41|issue=3/4|pages=157–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Schaffner's experience as a commercial photographer and Moyer's work as a designer and painter, the duo captured and created images reminiscent of commercial advertising but delivered messages that raised the profile of lesbians. This material was then placed where ads were typically seen, such as [[bus stop]]s, [[telephone booth]]s, and construction site barricades.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sNCJAwAAQBAJ|title=The Queer Encyclopedia of the Visual Arts|last=Summers|first=Claude J.|date=2004|publisher=Cleis Press|isbn=9781573441919|pages=256|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; DAM!'s method of presenting lesbian activist art in typically commercial landscapes creates an effect described by some as "slick subvertising"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bitchmedia.org/issue/10|title=Profile: Dyke Action Machine—Slick subvertising on the streets of New York City|last=Jervis|first=Lisa|year=1999|website=Bitch Magazine Volume 10|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "agit-prop".&lt;ref&gt;Blake, Nayland and Lawrence Rinder.

{{emotion}}

'''Ecstasy''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] ἔκστασις ''ékstasis'') is a subjective experience of total involvement of the subject, with an object of his or her awareness.  In classical Greek literature it refers to removal of the mind or body "from its normal place of function."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|page=505|author=H. S. Versnal|work=The Oxford Classical Dictionary|edition=Third, revised|title=ecstasy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Total involvement with an object of interest is not an ordinary experience because of being aware of other objects, thus ecstasy is an example of an [[altered state of consciousness]] characterized by diminished awareness of other objects or the total lack of the awareness of surroundings and everything around the object. The word is also used to refer to any heightened state of consciousness or intensely pleasant experience. It is also used more specifically to denote states of awareness of non-ordinary mental spaces, which may be perceived as [[spirit]]ual (the latter type of ecstasy often takes the form of [[religious ecstasy]]).

==Description==
[[File:Guido Reni - St Filippo Neri in Ecstasy - WGA19295.jpg|thumb|St Filippo Neri in Ecstasy by Guido Reni]] 
From a psychological perspective, ecstasy is a loss of self-control and sometimes a temporary loss of consciousness, which is often associated with religious mysticism, sexual intercourse and the use of certain drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ecstasy|title=Ecstasy|publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For the duration of the ecstasy the ecstatic is out of touch with ordinary life and is capable neither of communication with other people nor of undertaking normal actions. The experience can be brief in physical time, or it can go on for hours. Subjective perception of time, space or self may strongly change or disappear during ecstasy. For instance, if one is concentrating on a physical task, then any intellectual thoughts may cease. On the other hand, making a spirit journey in an ecstatic trance involves the cessation of voluntary bodily movement.

[[File:Jean Benner, L'Extase ( Musée d'art moderne et contemporain de Strasbourg ).JPG|thumb|''Ecstasy'', by [[Jean Benner]] ([[Strasbourg Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art]])]]
Ecstasy can be deliberately induced using religious or creative activities, [[meditation]], [[music]], [[ecstatic dance|dancing]], breathing exercises, [[physical exercise]], [[sexual intercourse]] or consumption of [[psychotropic drug]]s. The particular technique that an individual uses to induce ecstasy is usually also associated with that individual's particular [[anthropology of religion|religious]] and [[culture|cultural traditions]]. Sometimes an ecstatic experience takes place due to occasional contact with something or somebody perceived as extremely beautiful or holy, or without any known reason. "In some cases, a person might obtain an ecstatic experience 'by mistake'. Maybe the person unintentionally triggers one of the, probably many, physiological mechanisms through which such an experience can be reached. In such cases, it is not rare to find that the person later, by reading, looks for an interpretation and maybe finds it within a tradition."&lt;ref name="KajBjorkqvist"&gt;{{cite web|first=Kaj |last=Björkqvist |title=Ecstasy from a Physiological Point of View |url=http://www.ex-premie2.org/papers/religious_ecstasy.htm |work=(Scripta Instituti Donneriani Aboensis XI: Religious Ecstasy. Based on Papers read at the Symposium on Religions Ecstasy held at Åbo, Finland, on the 26th-28th of August 1981. Edited by Nils G. Holm. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040914183254/http://www.ex-premie2.org/papers/religious_ecstasy.htm |archivedate=September 14, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People interpret the experience afterward according to their culture and beliefs (as a revelation from God, a trip to the world of spirits or a [[psychosis|psychotic episode]]). "When a person is using an ecstasy technique, he usually does so within a tradition. When he reaches an experience, a traditional interpretation of it already exists."&lt;ref name="KajBjorkqvist" /&gt; The experience together with its subsequent interpretation may strongly and permanently change the value system and the worldview of the subject (e.g. to cause religious conversion).

In 1925, [[James Leuba]] wrote: "Among most uncivilized populations, as among civilized peoples, certain ecstatic conditions are regarded as divine possession or as union with the Divine. These states are induced by means of drugs, by physical excitement, or by psychical means. But, however produced and at whatever level of culture they may be found, they possess certain common features which suggest even to the superficial observer some profound connection. Always described as delightful beyond expression, these awesome ecstatic experiences end commonly in mental quiescence or even in total unconsciousness."  He prepares his readers "... to recognize a continuity of impulse, of purpose, of form and of result between the ecstatic intoxication of the savage and the absorption in God of the Christian mystic."&lt;ref&gt;James H. Leuba, "The Psychology of Religious Mysticism", p.8. Routledge, UK, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

"In everyday language, the word 'ecstasy' denotes an intense, euphoric experience. For obvious reasons, it is rarely used in a scientific context; it is a concept that is extremely hard to define."&lt;ref name="KajBjorkqvist" /&gt;

'''Elizabeth Jennings''' (real name '''Nadezhda'''; {{lang-rus|Надежда}}) is a fictional character in the American television drama series ''[[The Americans (2013 TV series)|The Americans]]'' on [[FX (TV channel)|FX]], as the female lead. Her character was conceived by show runner [[Joe Weisberg]] and is portrayed by [[Keri Russell]].

Elizabeth is a [[KGB]] agent who, with her husband  [[Philip Jennings (The Americans)|Philip]] ([[Matthew Rhys]]), is an [[First Chief Directorate|illegal]], posing as a travel agent in [[Washington D.C.]]

==Character history==

===Background===
Elizabeth was born Nadezhda in [[Smolensk]], the daughter of a coal miner and a bookkeeper for the local [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] committee. Her family suffered great privation both during and after the [[Great Patriotic War]], in which her father was killed. Elizabeth grew up believing her father to be one of the honored war dead, until her mother revealed that he had actually been shot as a deserter. When she was 14 her mother was bedridden with diphtheria, forcing Elizabeth to nurse her while still attending school.

As a teenager, the KGB approached Elizabeth as a candidate for the Illegals Program. Although prohibited from telling anyone, Elizabeth surreptitiously managed to consult with her mother about her decision, who unhesitatingly told her that she must do her duty for her [[Mother Russia|motherland]]. She trained to become an undercover agent until the age of 22. During this time, she was raped by one of her captains in the KGB, Timoshev. In 1962, Elizabeth and fellow KGB agent "Phillip Jennings" (Mischa) were assigned to each other to pose as husband and wife in America. In 1965 they move to America under false identities and take up work in a travel agency. Elizabeth meets and recruits civil rights activist Gregory to the KGB and has an ongoing affair with him. She gives birth to her and Phillip's first child, Paige, in 1967, and their second child, Henry, in 1970.

===Season one===
In 1981, Elizabeth Jennings lives with her husband [[Philip Jennings (The Americans)|Philip]] in suburban [[Falls Church, Virginia]]. They are revealed to be a pair of [[sleeper agent]]s working for the [[KGB]]. They have two U.S.-born children, Paige and Henry, both of whom are completely unaware of their parents' true identities. The Jenningses run a small travel agency in [[Dupont Circle]] as a cover for their illegal activities.

After a failed deportation, Elizabeth and Philip kidnap Timoshev, a defected KGB agent, who raped Elizabeth when she was in training. At the time of Timoshev's kidnapping, counter-intelligence FBI agent [[Stan Beeman]] moves next door, causing Philip to suggest defecting themselves. Elizabeth declines and Philip murders Timoshev when he finds out he raped her. Despite a marriage arranged by the KGB, Elizabeth tells Philip that she is beginning to feel love for him for the first time in their 16-year relationship and they try to become a real married couple. However, Philip is hurt upon discovering Elizabeth had an ongoing affair with Gregory Thomas ([[Derek Luke (actor)|Derek Luke]]), a black militant.

After planting a bug in [[Caspar Weinberger]]'s study, the Jenningses listen for vital intelligence. When the KGB begin to suspect a mole in their midst, they send operatives posing as FBI agents to kidnap and torture Elizabeth and Philip in order to test their loyalty. Elizabeth is hurt and angry that the people to whom she has devoted her life could treat her with such distrust, while Philip accuses Elizabeth of incurring the KGB's suspicions by reporting to them he had considered defecting. She denies this, admitting only that she had told their handlers that he liked living in the U.S. more than he should. Elizabeth and Philip later reconcile, but subsequently separate when Elizabeth discovers Philip had an affair with his former girlfriend, Irina. Philip moves out and into a motel.

Philip accidentally murders Stan's partner, Amador, during a botched operation, which causes Gregory to fall under the suspicion of the FBI regarding his involvement in the killing. Unwilling to go along with the KGB's plan to send him out of the country, Gregory spends a final night with Elizabeth and then commits [[suicide by cop]] to deflect attention from her. Later, Elizabeth's mentor, General Victor Zhukov, is assassinated under orders from a CIA officer, whom Elizabeth and Philip track down. Elizabeth brings him into a bathroom for sex, and she and Philip kidnap him and bring him to a warehouse, but Elizabeth, still upset about Zhukov's death, decides to let him go, whereupon the CIA officer gives the FBI a vague description of her and Philip.

Elizabeth learns from her informant, Sanford Prince, that he has secured a meeting with a [[United States Air Force]] colonel who has information on the SDI project. The FBI learn of the bug in Weinberger's study and provide the KGB with [[disinformation]] through it. Philip is unsure of the meeting with the Colonel and attends in her place (against her wishes), while Elizabeth goes to pick up the Weinberger tape. Philip finds out Elizabeth's mission is compromised and picks her up just as the FBI are closing in on her, but she is shot by Stan when the FBI begin firing on them. After Elizabeth's surgery, she tells Philip in Russian to "come home".

===Season two===
Elizabeth recovers at a remote safe-house and returns home in time for Henry's 11th birthday. However, the celebration is cut short, as she and Philip must go meet the Connors, another spy couple, but promise a "birthday weekend" at an amusement park. The Connors surprise Philip by involving him (and, unwittingly, Henry) in a supposedly safe mission during their visit, handing him a key to their hotel room to rendezvous when the operation is complete. When Elizabeth and Philip find all but one of the Connors family shot to death in their room, they become paranoid. Elizabeth locks down the house and suggests Philip tries to glean information from Martha, his FBI informant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Comrades |episodelink=Comrades (The Americans) |accessdate=February 27, 2014 |series= The Americans |serieslink=The Americans (2013 TV series) |network=FX |date=February 26, 2014 |season=Two |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Elizabeth learns that her daughter, Paige, has become deeply involved in a church that is active in liberal political causes. Elizabeth's reactions are mixed; on the one hand, she is pleased with Paige's growing awareness, but remains uncomfortable with its religious overtones. Upon discovering that her daughter has given all her savings to the church, Elizabeth punishes her by waking her up at 2 AM on a school night and forcing her to clean the house.

In the [[Echo (The Americans)|season finale]], Elizabeth is shocked to learn of the Center's plans to create a second generation of illegals composed of the U.S.-born children of KGB operatives indoctrinated and trained to infiltrate the American security agencies. The Connors' son, Jared, was the first to be contacted, with disastrous results—when his parents strenuously objected to his involvement in their espionage work, he killed them and his sister to protect his mission. Despite this tragedy, the Center tells the Jennings that it intends to continue with the program and that it expects them to begin grooming Paige. Both of the Jennings are horrified at first, but Elizabeth begins to warm to the idea, reasoning that Paige needs a cause to devote her life to and that she should know her parents' true identities and, by extension, her own.

==Personality==
Elizabeth grew up in poverty, and she developed a hard and icy exterior like her mother. The first 15 years of her marriage with Philip were relatively loveless. Elizabeth finally opens up to him after he kills her rapist. Initially, her newfound love for Philip is a conflict of interest to her because she has trouble constructively expressing and making sense of her own emotions. When Philip feels betrayed by her, they become dishonest with one another and briefly separate. It's only when Elizabeth is shot that she realizes how important Philip is in her life, and she realizes she can trust him with anything. She is intelligent, physically fit, and attractive. She is willing to use these qualities to manipulate people into giving her the information she needs.

Even though Elizabeth struggles to find a balance between making decisions with her newfound emotion versus the logic that has gotten her so far in her career, Philip is able to help her reach a collaborative decision; as they have become close friends and confidants as the show has progressed. Paige's adolescence is challenging for Elizabeth, particularly due to Paige becoming curious about her parents' activities. Elizabeth is a protective mother, and is around for her kids when they need her most despite being absent from the house most of the day working for the KGB. Elizabeth doesn't seem to have many hobbies, but she does enjoy bowling.

==Casting==
Former ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'' star Russell spoke about the decision to work on another television series: "I thought the pilot script was just so interesting. It was so far from a [[Procedural drama|procedural]]. And [originally,] I didn't know that I wanted to do it. I always say no to everything. I never want to do anything. [Laughs.] But I just couldn't stop thinking about it. I read it...and I kept trying to figure it out, because it's so not clear. It's still not clear to me. But there's so many different levels to it."&lt;ref name=Huff&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/30/the-americans-premiere-keri-russell-matthew-rhys_n_2584664.html |title='The Americans' Premiere: Keri Russell And Matthew Rhys Talk Sex, Spy Games And America Vs. Russia |author=Prudom, Laura |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=January 30, 2013 |accessdate=February 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
For her portrayal, Russell has been nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Television Series Drama]], the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series]] twice, three [[Critics' Choice Television Award]]s for [[Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actress in a Drama Series|Best Actress in a Drama Series]], one [[Satellite Award]] for [[Satellite Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama|Best Actress in a Television Series – Drama]], one [[Saturn Award]] for [[Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television|Best Actress on Television]], and the [[Television Critics Association Award]] for [[TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Drama|Individual Achievement in Drama]].

'''Ellen Hutchins''' (1785–1815) was an early Irish [[botanist]]. She specialised in seaweeds, lichens, mosses and liverworts. She is known for finding many plants new to science, identifying hundreds of species, and for her botanical illustrations in contemporary publications. Many plants were named after her by botanists of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mulvihill|first1=Mary|title=Stars, Shells and Bluebells|date=1997|publisher=Women in Technology and Science|isbn=978-0953195305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Ellen Hutchins was from [[Ballylickey]], where her family had a small estate at the head of [[Bantry Bay]], County Cork, Ireland. She was born 17 March 1785 at Ballylickey House, the second youngest surviving child of her parents. Her father, Thomas, was a magistrate who died when Ellen was two years old, leaving his widow Elinor and six surviving children (from twenty-one).&lt;ref name=DNB_Hutchins&gt;{{cite web|last1=Secord|first1=Anne|title=Hutchins, Ellen (1785–1815)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/59319|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was sent to school near Dublin, and while there, her health deteriorated, largely it appears through being underfed (healthy appetites not being considered ladylike).&lt;ref name=EllenHutchins_website /&gt; Dr Whitley Stokes, a family friend, took her under his and his wife's care in his house in Harcourt Street, Dublin. She regained her appetite and health, and also followed Stokes advice to take up natural history as a healthy hobby. Following her improved health, she returned to her family home to care for her mother and her disabled brother Thomas.&lt;ref name=EllenHutchins_website&gt;{{cite web|title=Ellen Hutchins: Ireland's First Female Botanist|url=http://www.ellenhutchins.com/|website=Ellen Hutchins: Ireland's First Female Botanist|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, her own health declined again and by late 1812 she was seriously ill. She and her mother moved to [[Bandon, County Cork|Bandon]] in 1813 to receive medical care. After her mother died there in 1814, she moved back to [[Historic Cork Gardens#Ardnagashel House|Ardnagashel House]], close to Ballylickey, to be cared for by her brother Arthur and his wife Matilda. She died on 9 February 1815 and was buried in the old Bantry churchyard. Her grave was unmarked, but a plaque was erected in 2002 by the Hutchins family in their private family burial ground. &lt;ref name=Leslie_Hutchins_memorial&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leslie |first1=Peter |title=A memorial to Ireland's first woman botanist |journal=The Linnean |year=2003 |volume=19 |issue=4 |page=18 |url=http://www.linnean.org/Resources/LinneanSociety/Documents/Publications/The-Linnaen/Lin%20Vol%2019_%20no%204_%20Oct%202003.pdf |accessdate=14 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513155725/http://www.linnean.org/Resources/LinneanSociety/Documents/Publications/The-Linnaen/Lin%20Vol%2019_%20no%204_%20Oct%202003.pdf |archivedate=13 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A public memorial was placed in the old Bantry (Garryvurcha) graveyard in 2015, the bicentenary of her death, by the National Committee for Commemorative Plaques in Science and Technology.&lt;ref name=MarshBSBI&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marsh|first1=Louise|title=Ellen Hutchins, Ireland's first female botanist|url=http://bsbipublicity.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/ellen-hutchins-irelands-first-female.html|website=BSBI News and Views|publisher=Botanical Society of British Isles|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SouthernStar2015"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wall plaque marks grave of Irelands first female botanist|url=http://www.southernstar.ie/News/Wall-plaque-marks-grave-of-Irelands-first-female-botanist-07092015.htm|accessdate=28 December 2016|agency=Southern Star|date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Botanical collecting and illustration ==
She focused on botany (Stokes' own specialism) and spent much time out of doors accompanied by the indoor occupations of identifying, recording and drawing the plants she collected. She studied plants, specialising in the [[Cryptogam]]s such as mosses, liverworts, lichen, and seaweeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pearson|first1=W H|title=Ellen Hutchins: a Biographical Sketch|journal=The Bryologist|date=September 1918|volume=21|issue=5|pages=78–80|jstor=3238747|doi=10.2307/3238747}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Braithwaite_Moss_Flora&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braithwaithe|first1=Robert|title=The British Moss Flora|date=1905|publisher=self-published|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all of her collecting was undertaken in the Banty area and County Cork. The [[Lusitanian flora]] of West Cork was comparatively unknown at this time. She learnt quickly and clearly had a gift for plant identification, produced very detailed watercolour drawings, and meticulously prepared specimens.  She sent samples to Stokes which he passed on to other botanists. Through Stokes she became acquainted with [[James Townsend Mackay]], a curator at the Botanic Garden of [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]]. He helped her in the classification of the plants she was collecting and she contributed to his ''Flora Hibernica''. In 1807, Mackay sent her specimens to [[Dawson Turner]] a botanist in Great Yarmouth on the East Anglian coast of England, for his publication ''Fuci''. Turner's 'thank you' note was the beginning of a seven-year correspondence and exchange of specimens and drawings.&lt;ref name=HeardmanBSBI&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heardman|first1=Clare|title=Ellen Hutchins – Ireland's 'first woman botanist'|journal=BSBI News|date=April 2015|volume=129|pages=48–51|url=http://archive.bsbi.org.uk/bsbi_news.html|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A selection of these letters has been published by the National Botanic Gardens Glasnevin, Dublin in 1999.&lt;ref name=MitchellNatBotGlasnevin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitchell|first1=Michael|title=Early Observations on the Flora of South West Ireland:selected letters of Ellen Hutchins and Dawson Turner, 1807–1814|date=1999|publisher=National Botanic Gardens Glasnevin|location=Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt; This publication also reprints the list of nearly 1100 plants that she prepared between 1809 and 1812 at the request of Dawson Turner for "a complete catalogue of plants of all kinds that you have found in your neighbourhood".

During her searches for specimens she recorded over 400 vascular plant species, around 200 species of algae, 200 bryophytes and 200 lichens. Among the latter two groups she discovered several new species including ''Jubula hutchinsiae'', ''Herberta hutchinsiae'', ''Leiocolea bantriensis'' (Bantry Notchwort), the lichen ''Thelotrema isidiodes'' and three further species of lichen that are named after her. Differences between her species lists and later records from West Cork are also of interest since they help date the decline of some species caused by changes in agricultural practices as well as the arrival of invasive species from other parts of the world.&lt;ref name=HeardmanBSBI /&gt;

Her ability to find new plants, and the quality of her drawings and specimens drew admiration from the leading botanists of the day, and her work was featured in many publications.&lt;ref name=Butler_Irish_plant_illustrators&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Patricia|title=Irish botanical illustrators and flower painters|date=1999|publisher=ACC Art Books|isbn=9781851493579|pages=160}}&lt;!--|accessdate=14 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Although she never published under her own name, she was a major contributor to the new and developing plant sciences of her era. At first refusing to have her name associated with her finds, she soon relented.&lt;ref name=HeardmanBSBI /&gt; The later volumes of ''English Botany'' (1790–1814) from [[James Sowerby]] and [[James Edward Smith]] included descriptions of her discoveries. The latter wrote of her that "she could find almost anything".&lt;ref name=DNB_Hutchins /&gt; Dawson Turner, in his ''Fuci'' (4 vols., 1808–19)&lt;ref name=Turner_Fuci&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Dawson|title=Fuci|date=1811|publisher=John and Arthur Arch|location=London|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bwxJAAAAcAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1819, after her death said "that botany had lost a votary as indefatigable as she was acute, and as successful as she was indefatigable." In William Hooker's liverwort monograph '' British Jungermanniae'' (1816), her name was more or less connected with nearly every rare species mentioned within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lett|first1=H W|title=Census of the Mosses of Ireland|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy|year=1915|volume=22|pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her rare finds included lichens and she contributed to [[Lewis Weston Dillwyn]]'s work ''British Confervae'' (1802–09).&lt;ref name=LWDillwyn_Confervae&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dillwyn|first1=Lewis Weston|title=British Confervae|date=1809|publisher=W.

She was a keen gardener, and she tended plants including ones sent to her by Mackay, in a field at Ballylickey, known as Miss Ellen's Garden. She was at her happiest in the garden, or out in her little boat, gathering seaweeds, which she then brought home to classify and paint.

==Plants named after Ellen Hutchins==

One genus of vascular plant was named after her:
*''Hutchinsia'' (now ''[[Hornungia]]'') in the [[Brassicaceae]].&lt;ref name=MitchellNatBotGlasnevin /&gt; The common name "Hutchinsia" persists in the UK for ''Hornungia petraea'' C. Agardh.

Three species of lichen are named after her:
*''Lecania hutchinsiae''&lt;ref name=Leslie_Hutchins_memorial /&gt;
*''Pertusaria hutchinsiae''&lt;ref name=HeardmanBSBI /&gt;
*''Enterographa hutchinsiae''&lt;ref name=HeardmanBSBI /&gt;

Several marine algae are named in her honour:

{{Feminism sidebar |expanded=Waves}}

[[Feminists]] have long struggled with [[Sigmund Freud]]'s classical model of gender and identity development and reality, which centers around the [[Oedipus complex]]. Freud's model, which became integral to orthodox [[psychoanalysis]], suggests that because women lack the visible genitals of the male, they feel they are "missing" the most central characteristic necessary for gaining [[narcissistic]] value—therefore developing feelings of [[gender inequality]] and [[penis envy]]. In his late theory on the feminine, Freud recognized the early and long lasting libidinal attachment of the daughter to the mother during the pre-oedipal stages. [[Psychoanalytic feminism|Feminist psychoanalysts]] have confronted these ideas (particularly the female relationship to the real, imaginary and symbolic [[phallus]]) and reached different conclusions. Some generally agree with Freud's major outlines, modifying it through observations of the pre-Oedipal phase. Others reformulate Freud's theories more completely.

==Hélène Deutsch==
[[Helene Deutsch|Hélène Deutsch]] (1884–1982) was one of Freud's first female pupils and the first analyst who made an integral, chronological study of woman's psychological development. In short, Deutsch claims that women have a passive-masochistic sexuality, they are born for reproduction and their development must be seen as different from the development of men.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, ''Psychoanalyse en vrouwelijke seksualiteit'', pp.103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deutsch sees the female development as exceedingly difficult and tortuous, because at some point she must transfer her primary sexual object choice from her mother to her father (and males), if she is to attain her expected heterosexual adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Juschka, D.M. “Feminism in the Study of Religion”, pp.88.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Deutsch, the girl blames her father, not her mother, for the lack of a penis; thus, she stops identifying with her father and masculinity.  Because of this relationship with her father, she develops [[libido|libidinous]] fantasies of being raped. Thus, the rape fantasy is universal and non-pathological, a key part of female sexuality.  Meanwhile, the girl identifies herself with her mother through the wish for an '[[anal stage|anal child]]'. When she recognizes her failure, a decline to the [[genital stage|pre-genital stage]] takes place: a wish for the earlier active ([[phallic]]) clitoris. [[Sadomasochism|Masochistic]] tensions in the girl prevail and she longs to be castrated by her father. The desire for a child also becomes masochistic.

==Nancy Chodorow==
[[Nancy Chodorow]] noted that Freud believed that males possess physical superiority and that a woman's personality is inevitably determined by her lack of a penis. Like Freud, but for different reasons, Chodorow emphasizes that the female Oedipal crisis is not resolved completely, unlike the male crisis: a girl cannot and does not completely reject her mother in favour of men, but continues her relationship of [[Attachment theory|attachment]] to her. The strength and quality of her relationship with her father are completely dependent upon the strength and quality of her relationship with her mother. Chodorow claims that most women are genitally heterosexual, but they have other, equally deep relationships with their children and with other women, as a result of the primary relationship with the mother.&lt;ref&gt;Chorodow, ''Family structure and feminine personality'', pp.87-89&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, a girl represses neither her pre-Oedipal nor her Oedipal attachment to her mother nor her Oedipal attachment to her father. This means that she grows up with more ongoing preoccupation with [[depressive position|internalized object relationships]] and with external relationships. Because a girl does not have to repress her pre-Oedipal and Oedipal attachment to father and mother, she reaches a more relational sensibility than boys. Chodorow illustrated this through studies suggesting that men love (and fall in love) romantically, where women love and fall in love sensibly and rationally.&lt;ref&gt;Chorodow, ''Feminism and psychoanalytic theory'', pp.73-74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Luce Irigaray==
In [[Freud]]'s model there is no place for [[femininity]] unless it is related to [[masculinity]]. [[Luce Irigaray]], a student of [[Jacques Lacan]], disagrees with the thoughts about the importance of the penis and phallic for women.&lt;ref&gt;Irigaray, ''Ce sexe qui n'en est pas un'', pp.73&lt;/ref&gt; She hypothesizes that the reason the penis is privileged in Freud's model is that it is visible. This is also the reason that male sexuality is based, in early Lacanianism, on having (a penis) and [[female sexuality]] is based on lack. In Freud's paradigm, female desire is the desire for a baby to substitute for penis, thus female pleasure is derived from reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Irigaray, ''Ce sexe qui n'en est pas un'', pp.57,34&lt;/ref&gt; Irigaray disagrees: "How can we accept that the entire female sexuality is being controlled by the lack and envy of the penis?"&lt;ref&gt;Irigaray, ''Ce sexe qui n'en est pas un'', pp.58&lt;/ref&gt; Female sexuality is not solely related to reproduction, but neither is it less valuable in reproduction, and thus it should not hold less social power.&lt;ref&gt;Irigaray, ''Ce sexe qui n'en est pas un'', pp.59&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, she says that Freud is forgetting the mother-daughter relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Irigaray, ''Ce sexe qui n'en est pas un'', pp.119&lt;/ref&gt; To enter the Oedipus-complex, a girl must hate her mother. Irigaray says this view makes it impossible for a girl to give meaning to the relationship with her mother.&lt;ref&gt;Irigaray, ''Ce sexe qui n'en est pas un'', pp.120&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gravestone of Andrew Drake.jpg|thumb|upright|Captain Andrew Drake (1684–1743) sandstone gravestone from the [[Stelton Baptist Church, Edison|Stelton Baptist Church]] [[Edison, New Jersey]]]]

A '''headstone''', '''tombstone''', or '''gravestone''' is a [[stele]] or marker, usually stone, that is placed over a [[grave]].  They are traditional for burials in the [[Christianity|Christian]], [[Judaism|Jewish]] and [[Islam|Muslim]] religions, among others.  In most cases they have the deceased's name, date of birth, and date of death inscribed on them, along with a personal message, or [[prayer]], but they may contain pieces of [[funerary art]], especially details in stone [[relief]].  In many parts of Europe insetting a photograph of the deceased in a frame is very common.

== Use ==
[[File:Garden of remembrance arch headstone.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Marble]] headstone of a couple buried together in [[Singapore]], showing an arched emblem, signifying the reunification with one's partner in heaven. Within the arch is a statue of [[Jesus Christ]]]]

The [[stele]] (plural [[stele|stelae]]), as it is called in an archaeological context, is one of the oldest forms of [[funerary art]].  Originally, a tombstone was the stone lid of a stone [[coffin]], or the coffin itself, and a gravestone was the stone slab that was laid over a [[grave (burial)|grave]]. Now all three terms are also used for markers placed at the head of the grave. Some graves in the 18th century also contained [[footstone]]s to demarcate the foot end of the grave. This sometimes developed into full kerb sets that marked the whole perimeter of the grave. Footstones were rarely annotated with more than the deceased's initials and year of death, and sometimes a memorial mason and plot reference number. Many [[cemetery|cemeteries]] and [[churchyard]]s have removed those extra stones to ease grass cutting by machine mower. Note that in some UK cemeteries the principal, and indeed only, marker is placed at the ''foot'' of the grave.

Owing to soil movement and [[Downhill creep]] on gentle slopes, older headstones and footstones can often be found tilted at an angle. Over time, this movement can result in the stones being sited several metres away from their original location.

Graves, and any related memorials are a focus for [[mourning]] and remembrance. The names of relatives are often added to a gravestone over the years, so that one marker may chronicle the passing of an entire family spread over decades. Since gravestones and a plot in a cemetery or churchyard cost money, they are also a symbol of wealth or prominence in a community. Some gravestones were even commissioned and erected to their own memory by people who were still living, as a testament to their wealth and status. In a [[Christianity|Christian context]], the very wealthy often erected elaborate [[church monument|memorials]] within [[Church (building)|churches]] rather than having simply external gravestones. [[Crematorium|Crematoria]] frequently offer similar alternatives to families who do not have a grave to mark, but who want a focus for their mourning and for [[Memorial|remembrance]]. Carved or cast [[commemorative plaque]]s inside the crematorium for example may serve this purpose.

== Materials ==
A [[cemetery]] may follow national codes of practice or independently prescribe the size and use of certain materials, especially in a conservation area. Some may limit the placing of a wooden memorial to six months after burial, after which a more permanent memorial must be placed. Others may require stones of a certain shape or position to facilitate grass-cutting. Headstones of [[granite]], [[marble]] and other kinds of [[Rock (geology)|stone]] are usually created, installed, and repaired by [[monumental masonry|monumental masons]]. Cemeteries require regular inspection and maintenance, as stones may settle, topple and, on rare occasions, fall and injure people;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/services/localgovernment/cemletter.htm Memorial safety] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611091332/http://www.hse.gov.uk/services/localgovernment/cemletter.htm |date=11 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or graves may simply become overgrown and their markers lost or [[vandalism|vandalised]].

Restoration is a specialized job for a [[monumental masonry|monumental mason]]. Even overgrowth removal requires care to avoid damaging the carving. For example, ivy should only be cut at the base roots and left to naturally die off, never pulled off forcefully.
Many [[building materials|materials]] have been used as markers.

===Stone===
* '''Fieldstones'''. The earliest markers for graves were natural [[fieldstone]],{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} some unmarked and others decorated or incised using a metal [[bradawl|awl]]. Typical motifs for the carving included a symbol and the deceased's name and age.
* '''Granite'''. [[Granite]] is a hard stone and requires skill to carve by hand. Modern methods of carving include using computer-controlled rotary bits and [[sandblasting]] over a rubber stencil. Leaving the letters, numbers and emblems exposed on the stone, the blaster can create virtually any kind of artwork or epitaph.
* '''Marble''' and '''limestone'''. Both [[limestone]] and [[marble]] take carving well. Marble is a recrystallised form of limestone. The mild acid in rainwater can slowly dissolve marble and limestone over time, which can make inscriptions unreadable. [[Portland stone]] was a type of limestone commonly used in England—after weathering, fossiliferous deposits tend to appear on the surface. [[Marble]] became popular from the early 19th century, though its extra cost limited its appeal.
* '''Sandstone'''. [[Sandstone]] is durable, yet soft enough to carve easily. Some sandstone markers are so well preserved that individual chisel marks are discernible, while others have [[delamination|delaminated]] and crumbled to dust. Delamination occurs when moisture gets between the layers of the sandstone. As it freezes and expands the layers flake off. In the 17th century, sandstone replaced field stones in [[Colonial America]]. [[Yorkstone]] was a common sandstone material used in England.
* '''Slate'''. [[Slate]] can have a pleasing texture but is slightly porous and prone to delamination. It takes lettering well, often highlighted with white paint or [[gilding]].

* '''Iron'''. [[Iron]] grave markers and decorations were popular during the [[Victorian era]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and elsewhere, often being produced by specialist [[foundries]] or the local [[blacksmith]]. [[Cast iron]] headstones have lasted for generations while [[wrought iron]]work often only survives in a rusted or eroded state. In eastern [[Värmland]], Sweden, iron crosses instead of stones have been popular since the 18th century.
* '''White bronze'''. Actually sand cast [[zinc]], but called white bronze for marketing purposes. Almost all, if not all, zinc grave markers were made by the Monumental Bronze Company of Bridgeport, CT, between 1874 and 1914. They are in cemeteries of the period all across the U.S. and Canada. They were sold as more durable than marble, about 1/3 less expensive and progressive.
* '''Wood'''. This was a popular material during the [[Georgian era|Georgian]] and [[Victorian era]], and almost certainly before, in [[Great Britain]] and elsewhere. Some could be very ornate, although few survive beyond 50–100 years due to natural decomposition.
* '''Planting'''. Trees or shrubs, particularly roses, may be planted, especially to mark the location of ashes. This may be accompanied by a small inscribed metal or wooden marker.

== Inscriptions ==
Markers sometimes bear [[monumental inscription|inscriptions]]. The information on the headstone generally includes the name of the deceased and their date of birth and death. Such information can be useful to [[genealogy|genealogists]] and [[local history|local historians]]. Larger cemeteries may require a discreet reference code as well to help accurately fix the location for maintenance. The cemetery owner, church, or, as in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], national guidelines might encourage the use of 'tasteful' and accurate wording in inscriptions. The placement of inscriptions is traditionally placed on the forward-facing side of the memorial but can also be seen in some cases on the reverse and around the edges of the stone itself. Some families request that an inscription be made on the portion of the memorial that will be underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fergus Wessell |url=http://www.stoneletters.com/gallery/photo/headstone-epitaph/|title=Headstone Gallery |date= |accessdate=2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, some gravestones also bear [[epitaph]]s in praise of the deceased or quotations from religious texts, such as "''[[requiescat in pace]]''". In a few instances the inscription is in the form of a plea, admonishment, testament of faith, claim to fame or even a curse—[[William Shakespeare]]'s inscription famously declares

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbear,
To dig the dust enclosèd here.
Blest be the man that spares these stones,
And cursed be he that moves my bones.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Or a warning about [[Death|mortality]], such as this [[Persian Empire|Persian]] poetry carved on an ancient tombstone in the [[Tajiki]] capital of [[Dushanbe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/fisk/article2941871.ece Robert Fisk: "An urge to smash history into tiny pieces"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215021234/http://news.independent.co.uk/fisk/article2941871.ece |date=15 December 2007 }} [[The Independent]], 8 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Moses roberts syllabics.JPG|thumb|Gravestone in Canada with indigenous language inscription in [[Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics]]]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;I heard that mighty Jamshed the King
Carved on a stone near a spring of water these words:
: "Many—like us—sat here by this spring
: And left this life in the blink of an eye.
: We captured the whole world through our courage and strength,
: Yet could take nothing with us to our grave."&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Or a simpler warning of inevitability of death:
[[File:Jewish cemetery Sobědruhy 06.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Hebrew]] inscriptions on gravestones in [[Sobědruhy]].]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Remember me as you pass by,
As you are now, so once was I,
As I am now, so you will be,
Prepare for death and follow me.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Headstone engravers faced their own "[[year 2000 problem]]" when still-living people, as many as 500,000 in the United States alone, pre-purchased headstones with pre-carved death years beginning with 19–.&lt;ref name=reason&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lynch|first1=Michael W.|title=Grave Problem|journal=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]|date=July 1999|url=http://reason.com/archives/1999/07/01/grave-problem|accessdate=7 September 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811124405/http://reason.com/archives/1999/07/01/grave-problem|archivedate=11 August 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bas-relief]] carvings of a religious nature or of a profile of the deceased can be seen on some headstones, especially up to the 19th century. Since the invention of photography, a gravestone might include a framed [[photograph]] or [[cameo (carving)|cameo]] of the deceased; photographic images or artwork (showing the loved one, or some other image relevant to their life, interests or achievements) are sometimes now [[engraving|engraved]] onto smooth stone surfaces.

Some headstones use lettering made of white metal fixed into the stone, which is easy to read but can be damaged by ivy or frost. Deep carvings on a hard-wearing stone may weather many centuries exposed in graveyards and still remain legible. Those fixed on the inside of [[Church (building)|churches]], on the [[Commemorative plaque|walls]], or on the [[ledger stone|floor]] (often as near the [[altar]] as possible) may last much longer: such memorials were often embellished with a [[monumental brass]].

The choice of language and/or script on gravestones has been studied by [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguists]] as indicators of language choices and language loyalty. For example, by studying cemeteries used by immigrant communities,&lt;ref&gt;Doris Francis, Georgina Neophytu, Leonie Kellaher. 2005. ''The Secret Cemetery.'' Oxford: Berg.&lt;/ref&gt; some languages were found to be carved "long after the language ceased to be spoken" in the communities.&lt;ref&gt;p. 42. Kara VanDam. 2009. Dutch- American language shift: evidence from the grave. ''LACUS Forum XXXIV'' 33-42.&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, a language used in the inscription may indicate a religious affiliation.

Marker inscriptions have also been used for political purposes, such as the grave marker installed in January 2008 at [[Cave Hill Cemetery]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] by Mathew Prescott, an employee of [[PETA]]. The grave marker is located near the grave of [[KFC]] founder [[Harland Sanders]] and bears the [[acrostic]] message "KFC tortures birds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bedard |first=Paul |url=https://www.usnews.com/blogs/washington-whispers/2008/01/10/peta-takes-fight-to-col-sanderss-grave.html |title=PETA Takes Fight to Col. Sanders's Grave |publisher=Usnews.com |date=2008-01-10 |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group placed its grave marker to promote its contention that KFC is cruel to chickens.

== Form and decoration ==

Gravestones may be simple upright slabs with semi-circular, rounded, gabled, pointed-arched, pedimental, square or other shaped tops. During the 18th century, they were often decorated with ''[[memento mori]]'' (symbolic reminders of [[death]]) such as [[Human skull|skull]]s or winged skulls, winged cherub heads, heavenly crowns, urns or the picks and shovels of the grave digger. Somewhat unusual were more elaborate [[Allegorical sculpture|allegorical figures]], such as Old [[Father Time]], or [[emblem]]s of [[trade]] or [[social status|status]], or even some event from the life of the deceased (particularly how they died). Large tomb chests, false [[sarcophagi]] as the actual remains were in the earth below, or smaller coped chests were commonly used by the [[gentry]] as a means of commemorating a number of members of the same family. In the 19th century, headstone styles became very diverse, ranging from plain to highly decorated, and often using crosses on a base or other shapes differing from the traditional slab. They might be replaced by more elaborately carved markers, such as [[cross]]es or [[angels]]. Simple curb surrounds, sometimes filled with glass chippings, were popular during the mid-20th century.

Islamic headstones are traditionally more a rectangular upright shaft, often topped with a carved topknot symbolic of a [[turban]]; but in Western countries more local styles are often used.

Some form of simple decoration may be employed. Special emblems on tombstones indicate several familiar themes in many faiths. Some examples are:

== Safety ==
Over time a headstone may settle or its fixings weaken. After several instances where unstable stones have fallen in dangerous circumstances, some burial authorities "topple test" headstones by firm pressure to check for stability. They may then tape them off or flatten them.

This procedure has proved controversial in the UK, where an authority's [[duty of care]] to protect visitors is complicated because it often does not have any ownership rights over the dangerous marker. Authorities that have knocked over stones during testing or have unilaterally lifted and laid flat any potentially hazardous stones have been criticised, after grieving relatives have discovered that their relative's marker has been moved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cemeteryfriends.org.uk/7.html National Federation of Cemetery Friends] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201143604/http://www.cemeteryfriends.org.uk/7.html |date=1 December 2008 }} Safety in cemeteries guidance&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007 [[Consistory Court]] and local authority guidance now restricts the force used in a topple test and requires an authority to consult relatives before moving a stone. In addition, before laying a stone flat, it must be recorded for posterity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecclawsoc.org.uk/cases/case47.shtml Ecclesiastical Case Reports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012150458/http://www.ecclawsoc.org.uk/cases/case47.shtml |date=12 October 2008 }} Re Keynsham Cemetery Gravestones&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgo.org.uk/pdf/LGO-612-Special-Report-final.pdf Advice and guidance from The Local Government Ombudsmen] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907053910/http://www.lgo.org.uk/pdf/LGO-612-Special-Report-final.pdf |date=7 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iberian Books''' is a bibliographical research project set up to chart the development of printing in Spain, Portugal and the New World in the early-modern period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://iberian.ucd.ie/about/ | title = About Iberian Books| work = website of the project team | accessdate = 2016-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It offers a catalogue of what was known to have been printed, along with a survey of surviving copies and links to digital editions.&lt;ref&gt; Alexander S. Wilkinson, 'Exploring the Print World of Early-Modern Iberia', ''Bulletin of Spanish Studies'' (2012), 89 (4):491-506 and Alejandra Ulla Lorenzo, 'Iberian Book Project (1472-1650): sobre los usos del catálogo en el estudio del impreso científico antiguo'. ''Ciencias y traducción en el mundo hispánico. 3, Mantua, "Pliegos" &lt;/ref&gt;  It is funded by the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://mellon.org/grants/grants-database/grants/university-college-dublin-national-university-of-ireland/41000633/ | title = Mellon Grant Awards| accessdate = 2016-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The records created are made available in an open-access database under a [[Creative Commons]] license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://iberian.ucd.ie/terms/  | title = Terms of Use| accessdate = 2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 2007 and based in the School of History at [[University College Dublin]], as of December 2016 the project has made available data for the period from the beginning of printing in the Iberian Peninsula around 1472 to the middle of the seventeenth century. In late 2017, the project expects to publish the datasets for the second half of the seventeenth century.  The datasets currently available online (1472-1650) hold information on 66,000 items, 339,000 copies, and 15,000 digital copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://iberian.ucd.ie/about/ | title = About Iberian Books| work = project website | accessdate = 2016-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project works in partnership with the [[University College Dublin Library|Digital Library Group]] at University College Dublin and with the [[Universal Short Title Catalogue|Universal Short Title Catalogue Project]] based at the [[University of St Andrews]].

==Project==
Iberian Books is a bibliographical resource similar to the [[English Short Title Catalogue]], helping to identify works by a given author or publisher, or on a given subject.&lt;ref&gt;See David McKitterick, 'Bibliography, Population and Statistics', in Joseph P. McDermott and Peter Burke (eds.), ''The Book Worlds of East Asia and Europe, 1450-1800. Connections and Comparisons'' (Hong Kong: HKU, 2015), p. 82 &lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it helps in identifying and mapping broader publishing trends.&lt;ref&gt; For the contours of publishing revealed by the data, see the introductions to the printed catalogue Alexander S. Wilkinson (ed.), ''Iberian Books. Books Published in Spanish or Portuguese or on the Iberian Peninsula before 1601'', (Leiden: Brill, 2010)'&lt;/ref&gt;  The datasets are published via a platform that facilitates the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) harvesting of metadata in OAI-compliant Dublin Core and Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS) formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://iberian.ucd.ie/about/ | title = About Iberian Books| work = project website | accessdate = 2016-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The datasets have also been incorporated in the open-access Universal Short Title Catalogue (USTC) based at the [[University of St Andrews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ustc.ac.uk/index.php/site/about/ | title = Information on the USTC Project| work = project website | accessdate = 2016-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dataset has been cited in academic monographs and journal articles, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=15151406177877744807&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en | title = Google Scholar| work = Google Scholar Citations for Iberian Books | accessdate = 2016-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by major auction houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/lot.pdf.L11406.html/f/25/L11406-25.pdf | title = Sotheby's Auction Catalogue 2011| accessdate = 2016-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Internet slang]], a '''troll''' ({{IPAc-en|t|r|oʊ|l|,_|t|r|ɒ|l}}) is a person who starts quarrels or upsets people on the [[Internet]] to distract and sow discord
by posting inflammatory and digressive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Definition of troll | work=Collins English Dictionary | url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/troll | accessdate=17 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[wikt:extraneous#Adjective|extraneous]], or [[off-topic]] messages in an [[online community]] (such as a [[newsgroup]], [[internet forum|forum]], [[chat room]], or blog) with the [[Bullying culture|intent of provoking]] readers into displaying [[emotion]]al responses&lt;ref name="PCMAG_def"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; whether for the troll's amusement or a specific gain.

Both the noun and the verb form of "troll" is associated with Internet discourse. However, the word has also been used more widely. Media attention in recent years has equated trolling with [[online harassment]]. For example, the mass media have used "troll" to mean "a person who defaces Internet tribute sites with the aim of causing grief to families".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trolling:TheTodayShowExplorestheDarkSideoftheInternet /&gt; In addition, depictions of trolling have been included in popular fictional works, such as the [[HBO]] [[television program]] ''[[The Newsroom (U.S. TV series)|The Newsroom]]'', in which a main character encounters harassing persons online and tries to infiltrate their circles by posting negative sexual comments.

== Usage ==
[[File:DoNotFeedTroll.svg|thumb|The advice to [[:wikt:ignore|ignore]] rather than engage with a troll is sometimes phrased as "Please do not feed the trolls."]]

Application of the term ''troll'' is [[Subjectivity|subjective]]. Some readers may characterize a post as ''trolling'', while others may regard the same post as a legitimate contribution to the discussion, even if controversial. Like any [[pejorative]] term, it can be used as an ''[[ad hominem]]'' attack, suggesting a negative motivation.

As noted in an ''OS News'' article titled "Why People Troll and How to Stop Them" (25 January 2012), "The traditional definition of trolling includes intent. That is, trolls purposely disrupt forums. This definition is too narrow. Whether someone intends to disrupt a thread or not, the results are the same if they do."&lt;ref name="Howard Fosdick"&gt;{{cite news|journal=OS News|title=Why People Troll and How to Stop Them|first= Howard |last=Fosdick|date=25 January 2012 &lt;!-- 06:58 UTC--&gt;|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/25540}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tastam90, Message # 369489"&gt;{{cite news|journal=CollegeNET|title=Terminology: Trolling in CNet?!?|author= Tastam90, Message # 369489 |date= 9 June 2013 &lt;!-- at 8:32 AM PDT --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have addressed the same issue, e.g., Claire Hardaker, in her Ph.D. thesis&lt;ref name="Tastam90, Message # 369489" /&gt; "Trolling in asynchronous computer-mediated communication: From user discussions to academic definitions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hardaker | first1 = C. | doi = 10.1515/JPLR.2010.011 | title = Trolling in asynchronous computer-mediated communication: From user discussions to academic definitions | journal = Journal of Politeness Research.

Regardless of the circumstances, controversial posts may attract a particularly strong response from those unfamiliar with the robust dialogue found in some online, rather than physical, communities. Experienced participants in online forums know that the most effective way to discourage a troll is usually to ignore it,{{citation needed|date=October 2012|reason=It is commonly said to be the most effective way, but are there any studies, or only anecdotes?}} because responding tends to encourage trolls to continue disruptive posts{{spaced ndash}}hence the often-seen warning: "Please do not feed the trolls".

The "trollface" is an image occasionally used to indicate trolling in Internet culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psu.com/a019344/Trollface-hack-strikes-PlayStation-3-PSU-community-member-reports-XMB-weirdness|title=Trollface hack strikes PlayStation 3?

At times the word can be abused to refer to anyone with controversial opinions they disagree with.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/12/i_m_not_a_troll_why_does_everyone_on_the_internet_keep_calling_me_one.html|title = Stop Calling Me a Troll|last = Manjoo|first = Farhad|date = 5 December 2012|work = Slate|access-date = 6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such usage goes against the ordinary meaning of troll in multiple ways. While psychologists have determined that the [[dark triad]] traits are common among Internet trolls, some observers claim trolls don't actually believe the controversial views they claim. [[Farhad Manjoo]] criticises this view, noting that if the person really is trolling, they are more intelligent than their critics would believe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Origin and etymology==
There are competing theories of where and when "troll" was first used in Internet slang, with numerous unattested accounts of [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] and [[UseNet]] origins in the early 1980s or before.

The English noun "troll" in the standard sense of ugly dwarf or giant dates to 1610 and comes from the [[Old Norse]] word "[[troll]]" meaning [[giant (mythology)|giant]] or [[demon]].&lt;ref name="Online Etymology Dictionary"&gt;{{OEtymD|troll||accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word evokes the trolls of [[Scandinavian folklore]] and children's tales: antisocial, quarrelsome and slow-witted creatures which make life difficult for travellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ln|title=Trollmother|url=http://trollmother.com/index.php/trollhistory|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trolls. Who are they?|url=http://csis.pace.edu/grendel/projs991a/troll.html|publisher=unknown|accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern English usage, "[[Trolling (fishing)|trolling]]" may describe the [[Fishing techniques|fishing technique]] of slowly dragging a lure or baited hook from a moving boat&lt;ref name="merriam-webster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/troll|title=troll|year=2010|work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary|accessdate=7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas ''[[trawling]]'' describes the generally commercial act of dragging a fishing net. Early non-Internet slang use of "trolling" can be found in the military: by 1972 the term "trolling for [[Mikoyan|MiGs]]" was documented in use by [[US Navy]] pilots in [[Vietnam]]. It referred to use of "...decoys, with the mission of drawing...fire away..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Life |date=4 February 1972 |author=John Saar |title=Carrier War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EkAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary use of the term is said to have appeared on the Internet in the late 1980s,&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/magazine/03trolls-t.html| title=The Trolls Among Us| last=Schwartz| first=Mattathias| date=3 August 2008| work=The New York Times| pages=MM24| accessdate=24 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GoogleUsenet"&gt;{{cite newsgroup| url=https://groups.google.com/group/alt.flame/msg/80135728c2dc034b?pli=1| title=FOADTAD| newsgroup=alt.flame|message-id=131460@sun.Eng.Sun.COM| date=8 February 1990| author=Miller, Mark S.| quote=Just go die in your sleep you mindless flatulent troll.| accessdate=2 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the earliest known attestation according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is in 1992.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite book| title='''troll''', ''n''.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;| work=Oxford English Dictionary| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2006| accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChanAFU"&gt;{{cite newsgroup| url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/alt.folklore.urban/iNal2CeYkSw/7Mwdly7upPkJ| title=Post the FAQ| newsgroup=alt.folklore.urban|message-id=26717@dog.ee.lbl.gov| date=8 October 1992| author=Chan, Terry| quote=Maybe after I post it, we could go trolling some more and see what happens.| accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EsanAFU"&gt;{{cite newsgroup| url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/alt.folklore.urban/E26iaSme1t0/mnZfdqUeM9oJ| title=Mixed up translations| newsgroup=alt.folklore.urban|message-id=4322@moscom.com| date=2 October 1992| author=Esan, David| quote=It just amazes me that when someone goes newbie trolling how many people he catches.| accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The context of the quote cited in the ''Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;ref name="ChanAFU" /&gt; sets the origin in [[Usenet]] in the early 1990s as in the phrase "trolling for newbies", as used in ''alt.folklore.urban'' (AFU).&lt;ref name="Porter"&gt;{{cite book| last=Tepper| first=Michele| title=Internet culture| editor=Porter, David| publisher=Routledge Inc| location=New York, New York, United States| year=1997| chapter=Usenet Communities and the Cultural Politics of Information| page=48| quote=...&amp;nbsp;the two most notorious trollers in AFU, Ted Frank and Snopes, are also two of the most consistent posters of serious research.| isbn=978-0-415-91683-7| url=https://books.google.com/?id=5d2stzIbkqMC| accessdate=24 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CromarAFU"&gt;{{cite newsgroup| url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/alt.folklore.urban/9gXNdotYPVc/TaD3xbBv-IAJ| title=Trolling for Newbies| newsgroup=alt.folklore.urban|message-id=Oct.9.10.26.26.1992.22869@math.rutgers.edu| date=9 October 1992| author=Cromar, Scott| quote=Some people call this game trolling for newbies| accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly, what is meant is a relatively gentle inside joke by veteran users, presenting questions or topics that had been so overdone that only a new user would respond to them earnestly. For example, a veteran of the group might make a post on the [[List of common misconceptions|common misconception]] that [[Glass#Behavior of antique glass|glass flows over time]]. Long-time readers would both recognize the poster's name and know that the topic had been discussed repeatedly, but new subscribers to the group would not realize, and would thus respond. These types of trolls served as a practice to identify group insiders. This definition of trolling, considerably narrower than the modern understanding of the term, was considered a positive contribution.&lt;ref name="Porter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SDope"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1764/what-is-a-troll| title=What is a troll?|last=Zotti|first=Ed| date=14 April 2000| publisher=The Straight Dope| accessdate=24 March 2009| quote=To be fair, not all trolls are slimeballs. On some message boards, veteran posters with a mischievous bent occasionally go 'newbie trolling.'|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notorious AFU trollers, David Mikkelson,&lt;ref name="Porter" /&gt; went on to create the urban folklore website [[Snopes.com]].

By the late 1990s, ''alt.folklore.urban'' had such heavy traffic and participation that trolling of this sort was frowned upon. Others expanded the term to include the practice of playing a seriously misinformed or deluded user, even in [[newsgroup]]s where one was not a regular; these were often attempts at humor rather than provocation. The noun ''troll'' usually referred to an act of trolling – or to the resulting discussion – rather than to the author, though some posts punned on the dual meaning of ''troll.''&lt;ref name="WilburAFU"&gt;{{cite newsgroup| url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/alt.folklore.urban/DjYm8Usd4TQ/oEDd8GixmQAJ| title=AFU REALLY REALLY WAY SOUTH| newsgroup=alt.folklore.urban|message-id=1993Feb8.010006.1589@Csli.Stanford.EDU| date=8 February 1993| author=Wilbur, Tom| quote=Tom "nice troll, by the way" Wilbur| accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In other languages ===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}
In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], trolling is referred to as ''bái mù'' ({{zh|c=[[:zh:白目|白目]]|l=white eye}}), which can be straightforwardly explained as "eyes without pupils", in the sense that whilst the [[pupil]] of the eye is used for vision, the white section of the eye cannot see, and trolling involves blindly talking nonsense over the Internet, having total disregard to sensitivities or being oblivious to the situation at hand, akin to having eyes without pupils. An alternative term is ''bái làn'' ({{zh|c=白爛|l=white rot}}), which describes a post completely nonsensical and full of folly made to upset others, and derives from a Taiwanese slang term for the [[Human male genitalia|male genitalia]], where genitalia that is pale white in colour represents that someone is young, and thus foolish. Both terms originate from [[Taiwan]], and are also used in [[Hong Kong]] and [[mainland China]]. Another term, ''xiǎo bái'' ({{zh|c=小白|l=little white}}) is a derogatory term for both ''bái mù'' and ''bái làn'' that is used on anonymous posting Internet forums. Another common term for a troll used in mainland China is ''pēn zi'' ({{zh|c=噴子|l=sprayer, spurter}}).

In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], {{nihongo|''[[wikt:en:tsuri#Japanese|tsuri]]''|[[wikt:en:釣り#Japanese|釣り]]}} means "fishing" and refers to intentionally misleading posts whose only purpose is to get the readers to react, i.e. get trolled. {{nihongo|''[[wikt:en:arashi#Japanese|arashi]]''|[[wikt:en:荒らし#Japanese|荒らし]]}} means "laying waste" and can also be used to refer to simple [[spam (electronic)|spamming]].

In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], ''[[wikt:en:þurs#Icelandic|þurs]]'' (a [[Jötunn|thurs]]) or ''[[wikt:en:tröll#Icelandic|tröll]]'' (a [[troll]]) may refer to trolls, the verbs ''þursa'' (to troll) or ''þursast'' (to be trolling, to troll about) may be used.

In [[Korean language|Korean]], ''nak-si'' (낚시) means "fishing", refers to Internet trolling attempts, as well as purposefully misleading post titles. A person who recognizes the troll after having responded (or, in case of a post title ''nak-si'', having read the actual post) would often refer to himself as a caught fish.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], more commonly in its [[Brazilian Portuguese|Brazilian]] variant, [[:pt:Troll|troll]] (produced {{IPA-pt|ˈtɾɔw|}} in most of Brazil as [[spelling pronunciation]]) is the usual term to denote Internet trolls (examples of common derivate terms are ''trollismo'' or ''trollagem'', "trolling", and the verb ''trollar'', "to troll", which entered popular use), but an older expression, used by those which want to avoid [[anglicism]]s or [[slang]]s, is ''[[:pt:Complexo do pombo enxadrista|complexo do pombo enxadrista]]'' to denote trolling behavior, and ''pombos enxadristas'' (literally, "chessplayer pigeons") or simply ''pombos'' are the terms used to name the trolls. The terms are explained by an [[adage]] or popular saying: "Arguing with ''[[Placeholder names in different languages#Portuguese|fulano]]'' (i.e., [[John Doe]]) is the same as playing [[chess]] with a [[pigeon]]: it defecates on the table, drops the pieces and simply flies off, claiming victory."

In [[Thai language|Thai]], the term ''krian'' ([[:wikt:เกรียน|เกรียน]]) has been adopted to address Internet trolls. According to the [[Royal Institute of Thailand]], the term, which literally refers to a closely cropped hairstyle worn by schoolboys in Thailand, is from the behaviour of these schoolboys who usually gather to play online games and, during which, make annoying, disruptive, impolite, or unreasonable expressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Photchananukrom Kham Mai Lem Song Chabap Ratchabandittayasathan|last = Royal Institute of Thailand|publisher = Royal Institute of Thailand|year = 2009|isbn = 9786167073040|location = Bangkok|pages = 11|script-title = พจนานุกรมคำใหม่ เล่ม ๒ ฉบับราชบัณฑิตยสถาน|trans-title = Royal Institute Dictionary of New Words, Volume 2|language = Thai|author-link = Royal Society of Thailand}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''top krian'' (ตบเกรียน; "slap a cropped head") refers to the act of posting intellectual replies to refute and cause the messages of Internet trolls to be perceived as unintelligent.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

== Trolling, identity, and anonymity ==

Early incidents of trolling&lt;ref&gt;[[Stevan Harnad]] (1987/2011) "[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/05/sky-writing-or-when-man-first-met-troll/239420/ Sky-Writing, Or, When Man First Met Troll]" ''The Atlantic''&lt;/ref&gt; were considered to be the same as [[Flaming (Internet)|flaming]], but this has changed with modern usage by the news media to refer to the creation of any content that targets another person. The Internet dictionary NetLingo suggests there are four grades of trolling: playtime trolling, tactical trolling, strategic trolling, and domination trolling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The relationship between trolling and flaming was observed in open-access forums in California, on a series of modem-linked computers. ''CommuniTree'' was begun in 1978 but was closed in 1982 when accessed by high school teenagers, becoming a ground for trashing and abuse.&lt;ref name=guar&gt;{{cite news |title=How the Internet created an age of rage |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jul/24/internet-anonymity-trolling-tim-adams |publisher=The Guardian (The Observer)|date= 24 July 2011 |location=London |first=Tim |last=Adams}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some psychologists have suggested that flaming would be caused by [[deindividuation]] or decreased self-evaluation: [[Online disinhibition effect|the anonymity of online postings would lead to disinhibition]] amongst individuals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S.

According to Tom Postmes, a professor of social and organisational psychology at the universities of Exeter, England, and Groningen, The Netherlands, and the author of ''Individuality and the Group'', who has studied online behavior for 20 years, "Trolls aspire to violence, to the level of trouble they can cause in an environment. They want it to kick off. They want to promote antipathetic emotions of disgust and outrage, which morbidly gives them a sense of pleasure."&lt;ref name=guar /&gt;

The practice of trolling has been documented by a number of academics as early as the 1990s. This included Steven Johnson in 1997 in the book ''Interface Culture'', and a paper by [[Judith Donath]] in 1999. Donath's paper outlines the ambiguity of identity in a disembodied "[[virtual community]]" such as [[Usenet]]:

{{quote|In the physical world there is an inherent unity to the self, for the body provides a compelling and convenient definition of identity. The norm is: one body, one identity&amp;nbsp;... The virtual world is different. It is composed of information rather than matter.&lt;ref name="mit"&gt;{{Cite book

Donath provides a concise overview of [[identity deception]] games which trade on the confusion between physical and [[epistemic community]]:

{{quote|Trolling is a game about identity deception, albeit one that is played without the consent of most of the players. The troll attempts to pass as a legitimate participant, sharing the group's common interests and concerns; the newsgroups members, if they are cognizant of trolls and other identity deceptions, attempt to both distinguish real from trolling postings, and upon judging a poster a troll, make the offending poster leave the group. Their success at the former depends on how well they{{spaced ndash}}and the troll{{spaced ndash}}understand identity cues; their success at the latter depends on whether the troll's enjoyment is sufficiently diminished or outweighed by the costs imposed by the group.}}

Trolls can be costly in several ways. A troll can disrupt the discussion on a newsgroup, disseminate bad advice, and damage the feeling of trust in the newsgroup community. Furthermore, in a group that has become sensitized to trolling{{spaced ndash}}where the rate of deception is high{{spaced ndash}}many honestly naïve questions may be quickly rejected as trollings. This can be quite off-putting to the new user who upon venturing a first posting is immediately bombarded with angry accusations. Even if the accusation is unfounded, being branded a troll is quite damaging to one's online reputation.&lt;ref name="mit" /&gt;

Susan Herring and colleagues in "Searching for Safety Online: Managing 'Trolling' in a Feminist Forum" point out the difficulty inherent in monitoring trolling and maintaining freedom of speech in online communities: "harassment often arises in spaces known for their freedom, lack of censure, and experimental nature".&lt;ref name="IUinformatics"&gt;{{cite web

Free speech may lead to tolerance of trolling behavior, complicating the members' efforts to maintain an open, yet supportive discussion area, especially for sensitive topics such as race, gender, and sexuality.&lt;ref name="IUinformatics" /&gt;

In an effort to reduce uncivil behavior by increasing accountability, many web sites (e.g. [[Reuters]], [[Facebook]], and [[Gizmodo]]) now require commenters to register their names and e-mail addresses.&lt;ref name="zhao.2010"&gt;J.

A 2016 study for the [[NATO]] Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence on [[hybrid warfare]] notes that the [[Ukrainian crisis]] "demonstrated how fake identities and accounts were used to disseminate narratives through social media, blogs, and web commentaries in order to manipulate, harass, or deceive opponents."&lt;ref name="NATO2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spruds|first1=Andris|last2=Rožukalne|first2=Anda|last3=Sedlenieks|first3=Klāvs|last4=Daugulis|first4=Mārtiņš|last5=Potjomkina|first5=Diāna|last6=Tölgyesi|first6=Beatrix|last7=Bruģe|first7=Ilvija|display-authors=2|date=n.d.|title=Internet Trolling as a hybrid warfare tool: the case of Latvia|website=stratcomcoe.org|location=Riga, LV|publisher=NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence|publication-date=28 January 2016|url=http://www.stratcomcoe.org/internet-trolling-hybrid-warfare-tool-case-latvia-0|access-date=28 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128210911/http://www.stratcomcoe.org/internet-trolling-hybrid-warfare-tool-case-latvia-0|archivedate=28 January 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=3}} The NATO report describes that a "Wikipedia troll" uses a type of message design where a troll does not add "emotional value" to reliable "essentially true" information in re-posts, but presents it "in the wrong context, intending the audience to draw false conclusions." For example, information, without context, from Wikipedia about the [[military history of the United States]] "becomes value-laden if it is posted in the comment section of an article criticizing Russia for its military actions and interests in Ukraine. The Wikipedia troll is 'tricky', because in terms of actual text, the information is true, but the way it is expressed gives it a completely different meaning to its readers."&lt;ref name="NATO2016" /&gt;{{rp|page=62}}

Unlike "classic trolls," Wikipedia trolls "have no emotional input, they just supply [[misinformation]]" and are one of "the most dangerous" as well as one of "the most effective trolling message designs."&lt;ref name="NATO2016" /&gt;{{rp|pages=70, 76}} Even among people who are "emotionally immune to aggressive messages" and apolitical, "training in [[critical thinking]]" is needed, according to the NATO report, because "they have relatively blind trust in Wikipedia sources and are not able to filter information that comes from platforms they consider authoritative."&lt;ref name="NATO2016" /&gt;{{rp|page=72}} While Russian-language hybrid trolls use the Wikipedia troll message design to promote [[anti-Western sentiment]] in comments, they "mostly attack aggressively to maintain [[emotional attachment]] to issues covered in articles."&lt;ref name="NATO2016" /&gt;{{rp|page=75}} Discussions about topics other than [[international sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis]] "attracted very aggressive trolling" and became polarized according to the NATO report, which "suggests that in subjects in which there is little potential for re-educating audiences, emotional harm is considered more effective" for pro-Russian Latvian-language trolls.&lt;ref name="NATO2016" /&gt;{{rp|page=76}}

== Psychological characteristics ==
Researcher [[Ben Radford]] wrote about the phenomenon of [[clown]]s in history and modern day in his book ''Bad Clowns'' and found that bad clowns have evolved into Internet trolls. They do not dress up as traditional clowns but, for their own amusement, they tease and exploit "human foibles" in order to speak the "truth" and gain a reaction. Like clowns in make-up, Internet trolls hide behind "anonymous accounts and fake usernames." In their eyes they are the trickster and are performing for a nameless audience via the Internet.&lt;ref name="Bad Clowns"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Radford|first1=Ben|authorlink=Ben Radford|title=Bad Clowns|date=2016|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|isbn=978-0-8263-5666-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concern troll ==
A ''concern troll'' is a [[false flag]] [[pseudonym]] created by a user whose actual [[Perspective (cognitive)|point of view]] is opposed to the one that the troll claims to hold. The concern troll posts in Web forums devoted to its declared point of view and attempts to sway the group's actions or opinions while claiming to [[ingroup bias|share their goals]], but with professed "concerns". The goal is to sow [[fear, uncertainty and doubt]] within the group.&lt;ref name="timemag"&gt;{{Cite journal

Although the term "concern troll" originated in discussions of online behavior, it now sees increasing use to describe similar behaviors that take place offline. For example, James Wolcott of ''Vanity Fair'' accused a conservative ''[[New York Daily News]]'' columnist of "concern troll" behavior in his efforts to downplay the [[Mark Foley scandal]]. Wolcott links what he calls concern trolls to what [[Saul Alinsky]] calls "Do-Nothings", giving a long quote from Alinsky on the Do-Nothings' method and effects:

In February 2010, the Australian government became involved after users defaced the Facebook tribute pages of murdered children Trinity Bates and Elliott Fletcher.

In the United Kingdom, contributions made to the Internet are covered by the [[Malicious Communications Act 1988]] as well as Section 127 of the [[Communications Act 2003]], under which jail sentences were, until 2015, limited to a maximum of six months.&lt;ref name=BBCNews&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-29678989|title=Internet trolls face up to two years in jail under new laws|work=[[BBC News]]|date=19 October 2014|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2014, the UK's Justice Secretary, [[Chris Grayling]], said that "Internet trolls" would face up to two years in jail, under measures in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill that extend the maximum sentence and time limits for bringing prosecutions.&lt;ref name=BBCNews /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/Internet-trolls-to-face-2-years-in-prison|title=Internet trolls to face 2 years in prison|author=UK Ministry of Justice|date=20 October 2014|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The House of Lords Select Committee on Communications had earlier recommended against creating a specific offence of trolling. Sending messages which are "grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character" is an offence whether they are received by the intended recipient or not.

On 31 March 2010, NBC's ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' ran a segment detailing the deaths of three separate adolescent girls and trolls' subsequent reactions to their deaths. Shortly after the suicide of high school student Alexis Pilkington, anonymous posters began performing organized psychological harassment across various message boards, referring to Pilkington as a "suicidal slut", and posting graphic images on her [[Facebook]] memorial page. The segment also included an exposé of a 2006 accident, in which an eighteen-year-old fatally crashed her father's car into a highway pylon; trolls emailed her grieving family the leaked pictures of her mutilated corpse (see [[Nikki Catsouras photographs controversy]]).&lt;ref name=Trolling:TheTodayShowExplorestheDarkSideoftheInternet&gt;[http://gawker.com/5506453/trolling-the-today-show-explores-the-dark-side-of-the-internet "Trolling: ''The Today Show'' Explores the Dark Side of the Internet"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102001807/http://gawker.com/5506453/trolling-the-today-show-explores-the-dark-side-of-the-internet |date=2 November 2013 }}, 31 March 2010.

In 2007, the media was fooled by trollers into believing that students were consuming a drug called [[Jenkem]], purportedly made of human waste. A user named Pickwick on [[TOTSE]] posted pictures implying that he was inhaling this drug. Major news corporations such as [[Fox News Channel]] reported the story and urged parents to warn their children about this drug. Pickwick's pictures of [[Jenkem]] were fake and the pictures did not actually feature human waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/internet-troll-sub-culture-s-savage-spoofing-of-mainstream-media-excerpt/|title=Internet Troll Sub-Culture's Savage Spoofing of Mainstream Media [Excerpt]|author= Whitney Phillips |date=15 May 2015|work=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, the subject of trolling was featured on the [[HBO]] [[television series]] ''[[The Newsroom (U.S. TV series)|The Newsroom]]''. The character of [[The Newsroom (U.S. TV series)#Main cast|Neal Sampat]] encounters harassing individuals online, particularly looking at [[4chan]], and he ends up choosing to post negative comments himself on an economics-related forum.

The publication of the 2015 non-fiction book ''The Dark Net: Inside the Digital Underworld'' by [[Jamie Bartlett (journalist)|Jamie Bartlett]], a journalist and a representative of the British [[think tank]] [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]], attracted some attention for its depiction of misunderstood sections of the Internet, describing interactions on encrypted sites such as those accessible with the software [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]]. Detailing trolling-related groups and the harassment created by them, Bartlett advocated for greater awareness of them and monitoring of their activities. Professor Matthew Wisnioski wrote for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that a "league of trolls, anarchists, perverts and drug dealers is at work building a digital world beyond the Silicon Valley offices where our era's best and brightest have designed a Facebook-friendly" surface and agreed with Bartlett that the activities of trolls go back decades to the [[Usenet]] "flame wars" of the 1990s and even earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-tour-of-the-webs-other-dark-side/2015/06/25/19a5ee2e-0e11-11e5-9726-49d6fa26a8c6_story.html|title=Inside the online world not indexed by search engines|date=26 June 2015|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As reported on 8 April 1999, investors became victims of trolling via an online financial discussion regarding PairGain, a telephone equipment company based in California. Trolls operating in the stock's [[Yahoo!|Yahoo Finance]] chat room posted a fabricated [[Bloomberg Television|Bloomberg]] News article stating that an Israeli telecom company could potentially acquire PairGain. As a result, PairGain's stock jumped by 31%. However, the stock promptly crashed after the reports were identified as false.&lt;ref name="Bond"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Links, Frames, Meta-tags and Trolls|last=Bond|first=Robert|year=1999|work=International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology 13|pages=317–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So-called Gold Membership trolling originated in 2007 on [[4chan]] boards, when users posted fake images claiming to offer upgraded 4chan account privileges; without a "Gold" account, one could not view certain content. This turned out to be a hoax designed to fool board members, especially newcomers. It was copied and became an [[Internet meme]]. In some cases, this type of troll has been used as a scam, most notably on Facebook, where fake Facebook Gold Account upgrade ads have proliferated in order to link users to dubious websites and other content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countermeasures.trendmicro.eu/all-that-glisters-is-not-facebook-gold/ "All that glisters is not (Facebook) gold"], CounterMeasures: Security, Privacy &amp; Trust (A TrendMicro Blog).

The case of ''[[Zeran v. America Online, Inc.]]'' resulted primarily from trolling. Six days after the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], anonymous users posted advertisements for shirts celebrating the bombing on AOL message boards, claiming that the shirts could be obtained by contacting Mr. Kenneth Zeran. The posts listed Zeran's address and home phone number. Zeran was subsequently harassed.&lt;ref name="Bond" /&gt;

[[Criticism of Scientology|Anti-Scientology]] protests by [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], commonly known as [[Project Chanology]], are sometimes labeled as "trolling" by media such as ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=5 October 2010|title=The Assclown Offensive: How to Enrage the Church of Scientology|first=Julian|last=Dibbell|date=21 September 2009|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/culturereviews/magazine/17-10/mf_chanology|publisher=''[[Wired magazine|Wired]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the participants sometimes explicitly self-identify as "trolls".

The '''Jack Benny Center for the Arts''', located in Bowen Park, [[Waukegan, Illinois]], is the Cultural Arts Division of the [http://www.waukeganparks.org Waukegan Park District]. The Center plays host to the Bowen Park Theatre and Opera Company (a professional theatre/opera company), the Waukegan Symphony Orchestra and Concert Chorus (community based performance groups), as well as numerous theatre, dance, and /visual art classes and private music and voice lessons.  The center started out as a not-for-profit corporation in 1964.  Upon the death of [[Jack Benny]] in 1974, the name was changed.  The music and fine arts school became part of the Waukegan Park District in 1982 as a division of the recreation department.

==History==
The Waukegan Park District completed a new home for the center and its departments in Bowen Park in 1987 and had become its own division of the park district. Originally the Center had been in Bowen Park, moved to Powell Park for a time, and was delighted to return to Bowen Park. With the addition of Goodfellow Hall, an eighty-nine-seat lecture-recital hall, the division founded Bowen Park Theatre and Bowen Park Opera in the mid 1980s. These two companies went from semi-professional to fully professional, non-Equity, non-union in three years.

Waukegan Symphony Orchestra was born on April 24, 1974, when favorite comedic son Jack Benny returned to his home town of Waukegan to star in the WSO's initial performance. It was a magical night, held at Waukegan High School's auditorium. Like the Music Center of Lake County, the Waukegan Symphony Orchestra has made itself synonymous with the broad range of culture that is the hallmark of the city.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  Through its thirty-five-plus-year history, the Waukegan Symphony Orchestra has engaged its audiences in both traditional and challenging works.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Musical direction now rests in the  hands of Maestro Stephen Blackwelder.

Waukegan Concert Chorus was established as a community chorus in 1976 to sing with the Waukegan Symphony Orchestra in a performance of Verdi's ''Requiem''. Both the members of the community{{Who|date=April 2011}} recognized the great benefit of retaining such a cultural asset in the community and the Chorus continued as an independent sister organization to the Waukegan Symphony Orchestra.

Lynn Schornick and Ken Smouse founded Bowen Park Theatre Company in the spring of 1987 at approximately the same time as Bowen Park Opera. The company's objective was to produce mostly classical drama and comedies, avoiding musicals and the repertory of neighboring theatre groups. Within three years, Bowen Park Theatre became a fully professional, non-equity theatre, joining the professional ranks of only two other companies in Lake County. Currently, the Ensemble Players (college age), the Roundtree Players (14–18 years of age) and Stage One (8–13 years of age) give the youth to young adults of the community an opportunity to develop and study the art of acting, also use the Dr. Lynn Schornick Theatre in Goodfellow Hall.

Bowen Park Opera Company has its roots to the Waukegan Symphony Orchestra performances in the mid-1980s.  In 1987, the new Jack Benny Center for the Arts facility was completed in Bowen Park.  Lynn Schornick and Ken Smouse founded Bowen Park Opera Company to perform in Goodfellow Hall. Its first production was a double bill in the spring of 1987 of Holst's ''The Wandering Scholar'' and Mozart's ''The Impresario''.   In 2003, Goodfellow Hall was renamed the Dr. Lynn Schornick Theatre in Goodfellow Hall to honor the man who had led the Cultural Arts to where it is today.  Dr.  Schornick retired from the Waukegan Park District in 2004.

In 1994, the Cultural Arts Division became responsible for the programs of the Waukegan Park District's Historic Districts. The operation and restoration of the Haines Museum in Bowen Park was only a part of that. Programs were developed and the newest of the Cultural Arts' departments, Bowen Heritage Circle, was born. The Bowen Heritage Circle specializes in traditional and special interest crafts and lectures.  The [[Waukegan Historical Society]] rents the Haines House and library space at Lilac Cottage.  The society maintains the collections and the park district provides the organization with a museum supervisor.

Goodfellow Hall was a part of the [[Jane Addams|Jane Addams']] [[Hull House]] Settlement House's Bowen Country Club.

'''John Ruskin''' (8 February 1819&amp;nbsp;– 20 January 1900) was the leading English [[art critic]] of the [[Victorian era]], as well as an art patron, [[Drawing|draughtsman]], [[watercolor|watercolourist]], a prominent social thinker and philanthropist. He wrote on subjects as varied as [[geology]], [[architecture]], myth, [[ornithology]], [[literature]], [[education]], [[botany]] and [[political economy]].

His writing styles and literary forms were equally varied. He penned essays and treatises, poetry and lectures, travel guides and manuals, letters and even a fairy tale. He also made detailed sketches and paintings of rocks, plants, birds, landscapes, and architectural structures and ornamentation.

The elaborate style that characterised his earliest writing on art gave way in time to plainer language designed to communicate his ideas more effectively. In all of his writing, he emphasised the connections between nature, art and society.

He was hugely influential in the latter half of the 19th century and up to the [[First World War]]. After a period of relative decline, his reputation has steadily improved since the 1960s with the publication of numerous academic studies of his work. Today, his ideas and concerns are widely recognised as having anticipated interest in environmentalism, sustainability and craft.

Ruskin first came to widespread attention with the first volume of ''[[Modern Painters]]'' (1843), an extended essay in defence of the work of [[J.M.W. Turner]] in which he argued that the principal role of the artist is "truth to nature". From the 1850s, he championed the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] who were influenced by his ideas. His work increasingly focused on social and political issues. ''[[Unto This Last]]'' (1860, 1862) marked the shift in emphasis. In 1869, Ruskin became the first [[Slade Professor of Fine Art]] at the [[Oxford University|University of Oxford]], where he established the [[Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art|Ruskin School of Drawing]]. In 1871, he began his monthly "letters to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain", published under the title ''[[Fors Clavigera]]'' (1871–1884). In the course of this complex and deeply personal work, he developed the principles underlying his ideal society. As a result, he founded the [[Guild of St George]], an organisation that endures today.

==Early life (1819–1846)==

===Genealogy===
Ruskin was the only child of first cousins.&lt;ref name="Intro"&gt;{{cite ODNB|first=Robert |last=Hewison| id=24291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, John James Ruskin, (1785–1864), was a sherry and wine importer,&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; founding partner and ''de facto'' business manager of Ruskin, Telford and Domecq (see [[Allied Domecq]]). John James was born and brought up in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, to a mother from [[Glenluce]] and a father originally from [[Hertfordshire]].&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gill Viljoen, ''Ruskin's Scottish Heritage: A Prelude'' (University of Illinois Press, 1956) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Margaret Cox, née Cock (1781–1871), was the daughter of an aunt on the English side of the family and a publican in [[Croydon]].&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; She had joined the Ruskin household when she became companion to John James's mother, Catherine.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;

John James had hoped to practice law, and was articled as a clerk in London.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; His father, John Thomas Ruskin, described as a grocer (but apparently an ambitious wholesale merchant), was an incompetent businessman. To save the family from bankruptcy, John James, whose prudence and success were in stark contrast to his father, took on all debts, settling the last of them in 1832.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; John James and Margaret were engaged in 1809, but opposition to the union from John Thomas, and the issuance of the debt, delayed their wedding which was finally conducted without celebration in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gill Viljoen, ''Ruskin's Scottish Heritage'' (University of Illinois Press, 1956) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; John James died on 3 March 1864 and is buried in the churchyard of St John the Evangelist, Shirley, Croydon.

===Childhood and education===
[[File:John Ruskin by James Northcote.jpg|thumb|Ruskin as a young child, painted by [[James Northcote (painter)|James Northcote]].]]
Ruskin was born at 54 Hunter Street, [[Brunswick Square]], London (demolished 1969), south of [[St Pancras railway station]].&lt;ref name="Childhood"&gt;''ODNB''  (2004) "Childhood and education"&lt;/ref&gt; His childhood was characterised by the contrasting influences of his father and mother, both fiercely ambitious for him. John James Ruskin helped to develop his son's [[Romanticism]]. They shared a passion for the works of [[Byron]], [[Shakespeare]] and especially [[Walter Scott]]. They visited Scott's home, [[Abbotsford House|Abbotsford]], in 1838, but Ruskin was disappointed by its appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20031012/ai_n12585843/] {{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret Ruskin, an [[Low church|Evangelical]]{{clarify|date=April 2018}} Christian, more cautious and restrained than her husband, taught young John to read the [[King James Bible]] from beginning to end, and then to start all over again, committing large portions to memory. Its language, imagery and stories had a profound and lasting effect on his writing.

Ruskin's childhood was spent from 1823 at 28 [[Herne Hill]] (demolished c. 1912), near the village of [[Camberwell]] in [[South London]].&lt;ref&gt;J. S.

===Travel===
[[File:Rose Terrace, Perth.JPG|thumb|upright|10 Rose Terrace, Perth (on the right), where Ruskin spent boyhood holidays with Scottish relatives]]
Ruskin was greatly influenced by the extensive and privileged travels he enjoyed in his childhood. Travel helped establish his taste and augmented his education. His father visited business clients in Britain's country houses, exposing him to English landscapes, architecture and paintings. Tours took them to the [[Lake District]] (his first long poem, ''Iteriad'', was an account of his 1830 tour)&lt;ref&gt;John Ruskin, ''Iteriad, or Three Weeks Among the Lakes'', ed. James S. Dearden (Frank Graham, 1969) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to relations in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], Scotland. As early as 1825, the family visited France and Belgium. Their continental tours became increasingly ambitious in scope, so that in 1833 they visited [[Strasbourg]], [[Schaffhausen]], Milan, [[Genoa]] and [[Turin]], places to which Ruskin frequently returned. He developed his lifelong love of the [[Alps]], and in 1835 he first visited [[Venice]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hewison]], ''Ruskin and Venice: The Paradise of Cities'' (Yale University Press, 2009) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that 'Paradise of cities' that formed both the symbolism and subject of much of his later work.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.453n2}}

The tours provided Ruskin with the opportunity to observe and to record his impressions of nature. He composed elegant if largely conventional poetry, some of which was published in ''Friendship's Offering''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=Introduction}} His early notebooks and sketchbooks are full of visually sophisticated and technically accomplished drawings of maps, landscapes and buildings, remarkable for a boy of his age. He was profoundly affected by a copy of [[Samuel Rogers]]'s poem, ''Italy'' (1830), which was given to him as a 13th birthday present. In particular, he admired deeply the accompanying illustrations by [[J. M. W. Turner]], and much of his art in the 1830s was in imitation of Turner, and [[Samuel Prout]] whose ''Sketches Made in Flanders and Germany'' (1833) he also admired. His artistic skills were refined under the tutelage of Charles Runciman, [[Copley Fielding]] and [[James Duffield Harding]].

===First publications of Ruskin===
Ruskin's journeys also provided inspiration for writing. His first publication was the poem "On Skiddaw and Derwent Water" (originally entitled "Lines written at the Lakes in Cumberland: Derwentwater" and published in the ''Spiritual Times'') (August 1829).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=2.265-8}} In 1834, three short articles for [[John Claudius Loudon|Loudon]]'s ''Magazine of Natural History'' were published. They show early signs of his skill as a close "scientific" observer of nature, especially its geology.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.191-6}}

From September 1837 to December 1838, Ruskin's ''The Poetry of Architecture'' was serialised in Loudon's ''Architectural Magazine'', under the pen name "Kata Physin" (Greek for "According to Nature").{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.4-188}} It was a study of cottages, villas, and other dwellings which centred on a Wordsworthian argument that buildings should be sympathetic to their immediate environment and use local materials, and anticipated key themes in his later writings. In 1839, Ruskin's 'Remarks on the Present State of Meteorological Science' was published in ''Transactions of the Meteorological Society''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.206-10}}

===Oxford===
In [[Michaelmas term|Michaelmas]] 1836, Ruskin [[Matriculation|matriculated]] at the [[University of Oxford]], taking up residence at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] in January of the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artmagick.com/poetry/poem.aspx?id=11553&amp;name=john-ruskin-christ-church-oxford |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017013829/http://artmagick.com/poetry/poem.aspx?id=11553&amp;name=john-ruskin-christ-church-oxford |archivedate=17 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Enrolled as a [[gentleman-commoner]], he enjoyed equal status with his aristocratic peers.  Ruskin was generally uninspired by Oxford and suffered bouts of illness. Perhaps the keenest advantage of his time in residence was found in the few, close friendships he made. His tutor, the Rev Walter Lucas Brown, was always encouraging, as was a young senior tutor, [[Henry Liddell]] (later the father of [[Alice Liddell]]) and a private tutor, the Rev [[Osborne Gordon]].&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Gamble, ''John Ruskin, Henry James and the Shropshire Lads'' (New European Publications, 2008) chapters 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; He became close to the geologist and natural theologian, [[William Buckland]]. Among Ruskin's fellow undergraduates, the most important friends were [[Charles Thomas Newton]] and [[Henry Acland]].

His biggest success came in 1839 when at the third attempt he won the prestigious [[Newdigate Prize]] for poetry ([[Arthur Hugh Clough]] came second).&lt;ref&gt;For his winning poem, "Salsette and Elephanata", Cook and Wedderburn 2.90–100.&lt;/ref&gt; He met [[William Wordsworth]], who was receiving an honorary degree, at the ceremony. But Ruskin never achieved independence at Oxford. His mother lodged on High Street and his father joined them at weekends. His health was poor and he was devastated to hear his first love, Adèle Domecq, second daughter of his father's business partner, was engaged to a French nobleman. In the midst of exam revision, in April 1840, he coughed blood, raising fears of consumption, and leading to a long break from Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;[[Derrick Leon]], ''Ruskin: The Great Victorian'' (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1949), pp. 54–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before he returned, he answered a challenge set down by [[Effie Gray]], whom he later married. The twelve-year-old Effie had asked him to write a fairy story. During a six-week break at [[Leamington Spa]] to undergo Dr. Jephson's (1798–1878) celebrated salt-water cure, Ruskin wrote his only work of fiction, the fairy tale, ''[[The King of the Golden River]]'' (published in December 1850 (but imprinted 1851) with illustrations by [[Richard Doyle (illustrator)|Richard Doyle]]).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.VI.305-54}} A work of Christian sacrificial morality and charity, it is set in the Alpine landscape Ruskin loved and knew so well. It remains the most translated of all his works.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Dearden, "The King of the Golden River: A Bio-Bibliographival Study" in Robert E. Rhodes and Del Ivan Janik, ''Studies in Ruskin: Essays in Honor of Van Akin Burd'' (Ohio University Press, 1982), pp. 32–59.&lt;/ref&gt; At Oxford, he sat for a pass degree in 1842, and was awarded with an uncommon honorary double fourth-class degree in recognition of his achievements.

===''Modern Painters I'' (1843)===
[[File:Portrait of John Ruskin (4671937).jpg|thumb|Engraving of John Ruskin by Henry Sigismund Uhlrich]]
Much of the period, from late 1840 to autumn 1842, Ruskin spent abroad with his parents, principally in Italy. His studies of Italian art were chiefly guided by [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]], to whom the Ruskins were introduced by [[Joseph Severn]], a friend of [[Keats]] (whose son, Arthur Severn, married Ruskin's cousin, Joan). He was galvanised into writing a defence of J. M. W. Turner when he read an attack on several of Turner's pictures exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]]. It recalled an attack by critic, Rev [[John Eagles]], in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' in 1836, which had prompted Ruskin to write a long essay. John James had sent the piece to Turner who did not wish it to be published. It finally appeared in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dinah Birch]] (ed.) ''Ruskin on Turner'' (Cassell, 1990) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Ruskin began ''[[Modern Painters]]'', John James Ruskin had begun collecting watercolours, including works by [[Samuel Prout]] and, from 1839, Turner. Both painters were among occasional guests of the Ruskins at Herne Hill, and 163 [[Denmark Hill]] (demolished 1947) to which the family moved in 1842.

What became the first volume of ''[[Modern Painters]]'' (1843), published by [[Smith, Elder &amp; Co.]] under the anonymous but authoritative title, "A Graduate of Oxford," was Ruskin's response to [[Joseph Mallord William Turner|Turner]]'s critics. An electronic edition is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/index.htm |title=the electronic edition of John Ruskin's "Modern Painters" Volume I |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date=28 June 2002 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin controversially argued that modern landscape painters—and in particular Turner—were superior to the so-called "[[Old Masters]]" of the post-[[Renaissance]] period. Ruskin maintained that Old Masters such as [[Gaspard Dughet]] (Gaspar Poussin), [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]], and [[Salvator Rosa]], unlike Turner, favoured pictorial convention, and not "truth to nature". He explained that he meant "moral as well as material truth".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=3.104}} The job of the artist is to observe the reality of nature and not to invent it in a studio—to render what he has seen and understood imaginatively on canvas, free of any rules of composition. For Ruskin, modern landscapists demonstrated superior understanding of the "truths" of water, air, clouds, stones, and vegetation, a profound appreciation of which Ruskin demonstrated in his own prose. He described works he had seen at the [[National Gallery]] and [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] with extraordinary verbal felicity.

Although critics were slow to react and reviews were mixed, many notable literary and artistic figures were impressed with the young man's work, notably [[Charlotte Brontë]] and [[Elizabeth Gaskell]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hilton, ''John Ruskin: The Early Years'' (Yale University Press, 1985) p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Suddenly Ruskin had found his métier, and in one leap helped redefine the genre of art criticism, mixing a discourse of polemic with aesthetics, scientific observation and ethics. It cemented Ruskin's relationship with Turner. After the artist died in 1851, Ruskin catalogued the nearly 20,000 sketches Turner gave to the British nation.

===1845 tour and ''Modern Painters II'' (1846)===
Ruskin toured the continent again with his parents in 1844, visiting [[Chamonix]] and Paris, studying the geology of the Alps and the paintings of [[Titian]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] and [[Perugino]] among others at the [[Louvre]]. In 1845, at the age of 26, he undertook to travel without his parents for the first time. It provided him with an opportunity to study medieval art and architecture in France, Switzerland and especially Italy. In [[Lucca]] he saw the Tomb of Ilaria del Carretto by [[Jacopo della Quercia]] which Ruskin considered the exemplar of Christian sculpture (he later associated it with the object of his love, [[Rose La Touche]]). He drew inspiration from what he saw at the [[Camposanto Monumentale|Campo Santo]] in [[Pisa]], and in [[Florence]]. He was particularly impressed by the works of [[Fra Angelico]] and [[Giotto]] in [[San Marco]], and [[Tintoretto]] in the [[Scuola di San Rocco]] but was alarmed by the combined effects of decay and modernisation on [[Venice]]: "Venice is lost to me," he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Q. in Harold I. Shapiro (ed.), ''Ruskin in Italy: Letters to His Parents 1845'' (Clarendon Press, 1972), pp.200–01.&lt;/ref&gt; It crystallised his lifelong conviction that to restore was to destroy, and that the only true course was preservation and conservation.

Drawing on his travels, he wrote the second volume of ''Modern Painters'' (published April 1846).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=4.25-218}} The volume concentrated more on Renaissance and pre-Renaissance artists than on Turner. It was a more theoretical work than its predecessor. Ruskin explicitly linked the aesthetic and the divine, arguing that truth, beauty and religion are inextricably bound together: "the Beautiful as a gift of God".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=4.47 (''Modern Painters II'')}}  In defining categories of beauty and imagination, Ruskin argued all great artists must perceive beauty and, with their imagination, communicate it creatively through symbols. Generally, critics gave this second volume a warmer reception although many found the attack on the aesthetic orthodoxy associated with [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] difficult to take.&lt;ref&gt;See J. L. Bradley (ed.), ''Ruskin: The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1984),  pp. 88–95.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer, Ruskin was abroad again with his father who still hoped his son might become a poet, even [[poet laureate]] just one among many factors increasing the tension between them.

==Middle life (1847–1869)==

===Marriage to Effie Gray===
During 1847, Ruskin became closer to [[Effie Gray]], the daughter of family friends. It was for Effie that Ruskin had written ''[[The King of the Golden River]]''. The couple were engaged in October. They married on 10 April 1848 at her home, Bowerswell, in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], once the residence of the Ruskin family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perthshirediary.com/html/day0507.html |title=May 7th 1828 |publisher=Perthshire Diary |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the site of the suicide of John Thomas Ruskin (Ruskin's grandfather). Largely owing to this association, Ruskin's parents did not attend. The European [[Revolutions of 1848]] meant that the newlyweds' earliest travelling together was limited, but they were able to visit [[Normandy]], where Ruskin admired the [[Gothic architecture]].

Their early life together was spent at 31 Park Street, [[Mayfair]] (later addresses included nearby 6 Charles Street, and 30 Herne Hill) secured for them by Ruskin's father. Effie was too ill to undertake the European tour of 1849, so Ruskin visited the [[Alps]] with his parents, gathering material for the third and fourth volumes of ''[[Modern Painters]]''. He was struck by the contrast between the Alpine beauty and the poverty of Alpine peasants, stirring the social conscience that became increasingly sensitive.

The marriage, not consummated, later dissolved under discord and eventual annulment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rose |first=Phyllis |year=2010 |title=Parallel lives five Victorian marriages |location=New York |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=0307761509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
Ruskin's developing interest in architecture, and particularly in the [[Gothic revival]], led to the first work to bear his name, ''[[The Seven Lamps of Architecture]]'' (1849).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=8.3-274}} It contained 14 plates etched by the author. The title refers to seven moral categories that Ruskin considered vital to and inseparable from all architecture: sacrifice, truth, power, beauty, life, memory and obedience. All would provide recurring themes in his work.

''Seven Lamps'' promoted the virtues of a secular and Protestant form of Gothic. It was a challenge to the Catholic influence of [[A. W. N. Pugin]].

In August 1850 Ruskin and Effie were at [[Wenlock Abbey]] where Ruskin sketched some of the arcading in the Norman [[Chapter House]], which was used in ''The Stones of Venice''.&lt;ref&gt;Gamble, Cynthia, October 2013, Ruskin Lost in Shades of Gray, Shropshire Magazine, pp. 74–76&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Stones of Venice''===
In November 1849, Effie and John Ruskin visited [[Venice]], staying at the Hotel Danieli.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lutyens, ''Effie in Venice'' (John Murray, 1965); reprinted as ''Young Mrs. Ruskin in Venice: Unpublished Letters of Mrs. John Ruskin written from Venice, between 1849–1852'' (Vanguard Press, 1967; new edition: Pallas Athene, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Their different personalities are thrown into sharp relief by their contrasting priorities. For Effie, Venice provided an opportunity to socialise, while Ruskin was engaged in solitary studies. In particular, he made a point of drawing the [[Ca' d'Oro]] and the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace, or Palazzo Ducale]], because he feared they would be destroyed by the occupying Austrian troops. One of these troops, Lieutenant Charles Paulizza, made friends with Effie, apparently with no objection from Ruskin. Her brother, among others, later claimed that Ruskin was deliberately encouraging the friendship to compromise her, as an excuse to separate.

Meanwhile, Ruskin was making the extensive sketches and notes that he used for his three-volume work, [[The Stones of Venice (book)|''The Stones of Venice'']] (1851–53).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/depts/ruskinlib/eSoV/index.html |title=Ruskin's Venetian Notebooks 1849–50 |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date=20 March 2008 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For [[The Stones of Venice (book)|''The Stones of Venice'']] see Cook and Wedderburn vols. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Developing from a technical history of Venetian architecture, from the Romanesque to the Renaissance, into a broad cultural history, ''Stones'' also reflected Ruskin's view of contemporary England. It acted as a warning about the moral and spiritual health of society. Ruskin argued that Venice had slowly deteriorated. Its cultural achievements had been compromised, and its society corrupted, by the decline of true Christian faith. Instead of revering the divine, Renaissance artists honoured themselves, arrogantly celebrating human sensuousness.

The chapter, 'The Nature of Gothic' appeared in the second volume of ''Stones''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=10.180–269}} Praising Gothic ornament, Ruskin argued that it was an expression of the artisan's joy in free, creative work. The worker must be allowed to think and to express his own personality and ideas, ideally using his own hands, not machinery.

{{Quote|text=We want one man to be always thinking, and another to be always working, and we call one a gentleman, and the other an operative; whereas the workman ought often to be thinking, and the thinker often to be working, and both should be gentlemen, in the best sense. As it is, we make both ungentle, the one envying, the other despising, his brother; and the mass of society is made up of morbid thinkers and miserable workers. Now it is only by labour that thought can be made healthy, and only by thought that labour can be made happy, and the two cannot be separated with impunity.|author=John Ruskin|source=Cook and Wedderburn 10.201.}}

This was both an aesthetic attack on, and a social critique of the [[division of labour]] in particular, and [[capitalism|industrial capitalism]] in general. This chapter had a profound impact, and was reprinted both by the [[Christian socialist]] founders of the [[Working Men's College]] and later by the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] pioneer and socialist, [[William Morris]].&lt;ref&gt;Fiona MacCarthy, ''William Morris'' (Faber and Faber, 1994) pp. 69–70, 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Pre-Raphaelites===
[[File:Millais Ruskin.jpg|thumb|''[[John Ruskin (painting)|John Ruskin]]'' painted by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[John Everett Millais]] standing at [[Glenfinlas]], Scotland, (1853–54).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/886970 Ruskin and Millais at Glenfinlas], ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', Vol. 138, No. 1117, pp. 228–34, April 1996. (Accessed via [[JSTOR]], UK.)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[John Everett Millais]], [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] had established the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] in 1848. The Pre-Raphaelite commitment to 'naturalism'&amp;nbsp;– "paint[ing] from nature only",{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=12.357n}} depicting nature in fine detail, had been influenced by Ruskin.

Ruskin came into contact with Millais after the artists approached him through their mutual friend [[Coventry Patmore]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Derrick Leon]], ''Ruskin: The Great Victorian'' (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1949), pp. 137–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Ruskin had not been impressed by Millais's ''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'' (1849–50), a painting that was considered blasphemous at the time, but Ruskin wrote letters defending the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood to ''[[The Times]]'' in May 1851.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=12.319–335}} Providing Millais with artistic patronage and encouragement, in the summer of 1853 the artist (and his brother) travelled to Scotland with Ruskin and Effie where, at [[Glenfinlas]], he painted the closely observed landscape background of [[gneiss]] rock to which, as had always been intended, he later added Ruskin's [[John Ruskin (painting)|portrait]].

Millais had painted Effie for ''[[The Order of Release|The Order of Release, 1746]]'', exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1852. Suffering increasingly from physical illness and acute mental anxiety, Effie was arguing fiercely with her husband and his intense and overly protective parents, and seeking solace with her own parents in Scotland. The Ruskin marriage was already fatally undermined as she and Millais fell in love, and Effie left Ruskin, causing a public scandal.

In April 1854, Effie filed her [[annulment|suit of nullity]], on grounds of "non-consummation" owing to his "incurable [[impotence|impotency]],"&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lutyens, ''Millais and the Ruskins'' (John Murray, 1968) p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sir William James, ''The Order of Release, the story of John Ruskin, Effie Gray and John Everett Millais'', 1946, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; a charge Ruskin later disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Rose, ''Parallel Lives: Five Victorian Marriages'', 1983, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin wrote, "I can prove my virility at once."&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lutyens, ''Millais and the Ruskins'' (John Murray, 1968) p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; The annulment was granted in July. Ruskin did not even mention it in his diary. Effie married Millais the following year. The complex reasons for the non-consummation and ultimate failure of the Ruskin marriage are a matter of continued speculation and debate.

Ruskin continued to support [[William Holman Hunt|Hunt]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]]. He also provided an annuity of £150 in 1855–57 to [[Elizabeth Siddal]], Rossetti's wife, to encourage her art (and paid for the services of [[Henry Acland]] for her medical care).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''ODNB'': "Critic of Contemporary Art".&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites also received both critical and financial support from Ruskin, including [[John Brett (artist)|John Brett]], [[John William Inchbold]], and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] who became a good friend (he called him "Brother Ned").&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Collingwood, ''Life and Work of John Ruskin'' (Methuen, 1900) p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; His father's disapproval of such friends was a further cause of considerable tension between them.

During this period Ruskin wrote regular reviews of the annual exhibitions at the [[Royal Academy]] under the title ''Academy Notes'' (1855–59, 1875).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=vol. 14}} They were highly influential, capable of making and breaking reputations. The satirical magazine, ''[[punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', for example, published the lines (24 May 1856), "I paints and paints,/hears no complaints/And sells before I'm dry,/Till savage Ruskin/He sticks his tusk in/Then nobody will buy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=udKymsQhKMEC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q=I%20paints%20and%20paints%2C%2Fhears%20no%20complaints%2FAnd%20sells%20before%20I%E2%80%99m%20dry%2C%2FTill%20savage%20Ruskin%20sticks%20his%20tusk%20in%2FThen%20nobody%20will%20buy ] {{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin was an art-philanthropist: in March 1861 he gave 48 [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] drawings to the [[Ashmolean]] in [[Oxford]], and a further 25 to the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]], [[Cambridge]] in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/gallery/turner/info.htm |title=Fitzwilliam Museum Collections Explorer |website=Fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903031532/http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/gallery/turner/info.htm |archivedate=3 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's own work was very distinctive, and he occasionally exhibited his watercolours: in the United States in 1857–58 and 1879, for example; and in England, at the Fine Art Society in 1878, and at the Royal Society of Painters in Watercolour (of which he was an honorary member) in 1879. He created many careful studies of natural forms, based on his detailed botanical, geological and architectural observations.&lt;ref&gt;The relation between Ruskin, his art and criticism, was explored in the exhibition Ruskin, Turner and the Pre-Raphaelites (Tate Britain, 2000), curated by Robert Hewison, Stephen Wildman and Ian Warrell.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of his work include a painted, floral pilaster decoration in the central room of [[Wallington Hall]] in Northumberland, home of his friend [[Pauline Trevelyan]]. The [[Stained glass|stained glass window]] in the ''Little Church of St Francis'' Funtley, [[Fareham, Hampshire]] is reputed to have been designed by him. Originally placed in the ''St. Peter's Church'' Duntisbourne Abbots near [[Cirencester]], the window depicts the Ascension and the Nativity.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Low &amp; Julie Graham, ''The stained glass window of the Little Church of St. Francis'', private publication August 2002 &amp; April 2006, for viewing Fareham Library reference Section or the [[Westbury Manor Museum]] Ref: section Fareham, hants; [http://homepage.ntlworld.com/m.low1/funtley/funtleychurch.htm The stained glass window of the Church of St. Francis.

Ruskin's theories also inspired some architects to adapt the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]. Such buildings created what has been called a distinctive "Ruskinian Gothic".&lt;ref&gt;J. Mordaunt Crook, "Ruskinian Gothic" in ''The Ruskin Polygon: Essays on the Imagination of John Ruskin'' ed. John Dixon Hunt and Faith M. Holland (Manchester University Press, 1982), pp. 65–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his friendship with [[Sir Henry Acland]], from 1854 Ruskin supported attempts to establish what became the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]] (designed by [[Benjamin Woodward]]) which is the closest thing to a model of this style, but still failed completely to satisfy Ruskin. The many twists and turns in the Museum's development, not least its increasing cost, and the University authorities' less than enthusiastic attitude towards it, proved increasingly frustrating for Ruskin.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brooks, ''John Ruskin and Victorian Architecture'' (Thames and Hudson, 1991), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ruskin and education===
The [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History|Museum]] was part of a wider plan to improve science provision at Oxford, something the University initially resisted. The mid-1850s saw Ruskin's first direct involvement in education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/john_ruskin.htm |title=John Ruskin on education |website=Infed.org |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he taught drawing classes (assisted by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]) at the [[Working Men's College]], established by the [[Christian socialists]], [[Frederick James Furnivall]] and [[Frederick Denison Maurice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infed.org/walking/wa-wmenc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805231329/http://www.infed.org/walking/wa-wmenc.htm |archivedate=5 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he did not share the founders' politics, he strongly supported the idea that through education workers could achieve a crucially important sense of (self-)fulfilment.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=13.553}} One result of this involvement was Ruskin's ''Elements of Drawing'' (1857).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=15.23-232}} He had taught several women drawing by letter, and his book was both a response and a challenge to contemporary drawing manuals.&lt;ref&gt;''ODNB''.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a useful recruiting ground for assistants, on some of whom Ruskin would later come to rely, such as his future publisher, [[George Allen (publisher)|George Allen]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hewison, ''Ruskin and Oxford: The Art of Education'' (Clarendon Press, 1996), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1859 until 1868, Ruskin was involved with the progressive school for girls at [[Winnington Hall]] in Cheshire. A frequent visitor, letter-writer, and donor of pictures and geological specimens, Ruskin approved of the mixture of sports, handicrafts, music and dancing embraced by its principal, Miss Bell.&lt;ref&gt;''The Winnington Letters: John Ruskin's correspondence with Margaret Alexis Bell and the children at Winnington Hall'' ed. Van Akin Burd (Harvard University Press, 1969) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association led to Ruskin's sub-Socratic work, ''The Ethics of the Dust'' (published December 1865, imprinted 1866), an imagined conversation with Winnington girls in which he cast himself as the "Old Lecturer".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.197–372}} On the surface a discourse on crystallography, it represents a metaphorical exploration of social and political ideals. In the 1880s, Ruskin became involved with another educational institution, [[Whitelands College]], a training college for teachers, where he instituted a [[May Queen]] festival that endures today.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Cole, ''"Be Like Daisies": John Ruskin and the Cultivation of Beauty at Whitelands College (Guild of St George Ruskin Lecture 1992)'' (Brentham Press for The Guild of St George, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; (It was also replicated in the 19th century at the [[Cork (city)|Cork]] High School for Girls.) Ruskin also bestowed books and gemstones upon [[Somerville College]], one of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]'s first two [[women's college]]s, which he visited regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manuel|first1=Anne|title=Breaking New Ground: A History of Somerville College as seen through its Buildings|page=12|date=2013|publisher=Somerville College|location=Oxford|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also donated many of his books to the [[Somerville College Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/4054/History%20of%20the%20library.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108093838/http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/4054/History%20of%20the%20library.html |archivedate=8 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Modern Painters III'' and ''IV''===
Both volumes III and IV of ''Modern Painters'' were published in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Respectively, Cook and Wedderburn vols. 5 and 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''MP'' III Ruskin argued that all great art is "the expression of the spirits of great men".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=5.69}} Only the morally and spiritually healthy are capable of admiring the noble and the beautiful, and transforming them into great art by imaginatively penetrating their essence. ''MP'' IV presents the geology of the Alps in terms of landscape painting, and its moral and spiritual influence on those living nearby. The contrasting final chapters, "The Mountain Glory" and "The Mountain Gloom"&lt;ref&gt;Francis O'Gorman, "Ruskin's Mountain Gloom" in Rachel Dickinson and Keith Hanley (eds), ''Ruskin's Struggle for Coherence: Self-Representation through Art, Place and Society'' (Cambridge Scholars Press, 2006), pp. 76–89.&lt;/ref&gt; provide an early example of Ruskin's social analysis, highlighting the poverty of the peasants living in the lower Alps.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=5.385–417, 418–68}}&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davis, "Ruskin‟s Dialectic: Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory" in ''Ruskin Programme Bulletin'', no. 25 (January 2001), pp. 6–8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public lecturer===
In addition to his more formal teaching classes, Ruskin became an increasingly popular public lecturer in the 1850s. His first were in Edinburgh, in November 1853, on architecture and painting. Lectures at the [[Art Treasures Exhibition]], Manchester in 1857, were collected as ''The Political Economy of Art'' and later under [[Keats]]'s phrase, ''A Joy For Ever''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=16.9-174}} He spoke about how to acquire, and how to use art, arguing that England had forgotten that true wealth is virtue, and that art is an index of a nation's well-being. Individuals have a responsibility to consume wisely, stimulating beneficent demand. The increasingly critical tone and political nature of Ruskin's intervention outraged his father and the [[Manchester School of economics|"Manchester School" of economists]], as represented by a hostile review in the ''[[Manchester Examiner and Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Bradley (ed.), ''Ruskin: The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1984), pp. 202–05.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Ruskin scholar, Helen Gill Viljoen, notes Ruskin was increasingly critical of his father, especially in letters written by Ruskin directly to him, many of them still unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;Most of Viljoen's work remains unpublished, but has been explored by Van Akin Burd and James L. Spates.

Spates].&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin gave the inaugural address at the Cambridge School of Art in 1858, an institution from which the modern-day [[Anglia Ruskin University]] has grown.&lt;ref&gt;For the address itself, see Cook and Wedderburn 16.177–206, and for the wider context: Clive Wilmer, "Ruskin and Cambridge" in ''The Companion'' (Newsletter of The Guild of St. George) no.7 (2007), pp.8–10. [Revised version of inaugural Ruskin Lecture, Anglia Ruskin University, 11 October 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Two Paths'' (1859), five lectures given in London, [[Manchester]], [[Bradford]] and [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge]]{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=16.251–426}} Ruskin argued that a 'vital law' underpins art and architecture, drawing on the [[labour theory of value]].{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=16.251}} (For other addresses and letters, Cook and Wedderburn, vol. 16, pp.&amp;nbsp;427–87.) The year 1859 also marked his last tour of Europe with his ageing parents, to Germany and [[Switzerland]].

===Turner Bequest===
Ruskin had been in Venice when he heard about [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner's]] death in 1851. Being named an executor to Turner's will was an honour that Ruskin respectfully declined, but later took up. In 1856, Ruskin's book in celebration of the sea, ''The Harbours of England'', revolving around Turner's drawings, was published.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=13.9–80}} In January 1857, Ruskin's ''Notes on the Turner Gallery at Marlborough House, 1856'' was published.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=13.95–186}} He persuaded the [[National Gallery]] to allow him to work on the Turner Bequest of nearly 20,000 individual artworks left to the nation by the artist. This involved Ruskin in an enormous amount of work, completed in May 1858: cataloguing, framing and conserving.&lt;ref&gt;For the catalogues, Cook and Wedderburn 19.187–230 and 351–538. For letters, see 13.329-50 and further notes, 539–646.&lt;/ref&gt; 400 watercolours were displayed in cabinets of Ruskin's design.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Recent scholarship has argued that Ruskin did not, as previously thought, collude in the destruction of Turner's erotic drawings,&lt;ref&gt;Ian Warrell "Exploring the 'Dark Side': Ruskin and the Problem of Turner's Erotica", ''British Art Journal'', vol. IV, no. 1 (Spring 2003), pp. 15–46.&lt;/ref&gt; but his work on the Bequest did modify his attitude towards Turner.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davis, "Misinterpreting Ruskin: New light on the "dark clue‟ in the basement of the National Gallery, 1857–58" in ''Nineteenth-Century Prose'', vol. 38, no. 2 (Fall 2011), pp. 35–64.&lt;/ref&gt; (See below, [[John Ruskin#Turner's erotic drawings|Controversies: Turner's Erotic Drawings]])

===Religious "unconversion"===
In 1858, Ruskin was again travelling in Europe. The tour took him from [[Switzerland]] to [[Turin]] where he saw [[Paolo Veronese]]'s ''Presentation of the Queen of Sheba''. He would later claim (in April 1877) that the discovery of this painting, contrasting starkly with a particularly dull sermon, led to his "unconversion" from [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christianity]].{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=29.89}} But in reality he had doubted his Evangelical Christian faith for some time, threatened by Biblical and geological scholarship that had undermined the literal truth and absolute authority of the Bible:&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wheeler, ''Ruskin's God'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "those dreadful hammers!" he wrote to [[Henry Acland]], "I hear the chink of them at the end of every cadence of the Bible verses."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=36.115}} This "loss of faith" precipitated a considerable crisis. His confidence undermined, he believed that much of his writing to date had been founded on a bed of lies and half-truths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/atheories/4.2.html |title=Chapter Four, Section II. Loss of Belief |website=Victorianweb.org |date=25 July 2005 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later returned to Christianity.&lt;ref name="victorianweb.org"&gt;http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/atheories/4.3.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social critic and reformer: ''Unto This Last''===
{{Quote box |width=380px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right
|quote=Whenever I look or travel in England or abroad, I see that men, wherever they can reach, destroy all beauty. |source=&lt;small&gt;Cook and Wedderburn, 7.V.422–3 (1860).&lt;/small&gt; }}

Although Ruskin said in 1877 that in 1860, "I gave up my art work and wrote ''[[Unto This Last]]'' ... the central work of my life" the break was not so dramatic or final.&lt;ref&gt;E. T. Cook, ''The Life of John Ruskin'' (2 vols., 2nd edn., George Allen, 1912), vol. 2, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his crisis of faith, and influenced in part by his friend, [[Thomas Carlyle]] (whom he had first met in 1850), Ruskin's emphasis shifted from art towards social issues from the end of the 1850s. Nevertheless, he continued to lecture on and write about a dazzlingly wide range of subjects including art and, among many others, geology (in June 1863 he lectured on the Alps), art practice and judgement (''The Cestus of Aglaia''), botany and mythology (''Proserpina'', ''The Queen of the Air''). He continued to draw and paint in watercolours, and to travel widely across Europe with servants and friends. In 1868, his tour took him to [[Abbeville]], and in the following year he was in [[Verona]] (studying tombs for the [[Arundel Society]]) and [[Venice]] (where he was joined by [[William Holman Hunt]]). Yet increasingly Ruskin concentrated his energies on fiercely attacking [[capitalism|industrial capitalism]], and the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] theories of [[political economy]] underpinning it. He repudiated his eloquent style, writing now in plainer, simpler language, to communicate his message straightforwardly.&lt;ref&gt;On the importance of words and language: Cook and Wedderburn  18.65, 18.64, and 20.75.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box |width=380px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right
|quote=There is no wealth but life. Life, including all its powers of love, of joy, and of admiration.

|source=&lt;small&gt;Cook and Wedderburn, 17.105&lt;/small&gt;}}

Ruskin's social view broadened from concerns about the dignity of labour to consider wider issues of citizenship, and notions of the ideal community. Just as he had questioned aesthetic orthodoxy in his earliest writings, he now dissected the orthodox political economy espoused by [[John Stuart Mill]], based on theories of [[laissez-faire]] and competition drawn from the work of [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]] and [[Thomas Malthus]]. In his four essays, ''[[Unto This Last]]'', Ruskin rejected the [[division of labour]] as dehumanising (separating labourer from his product), and argued that the "science" of [[political economy]] failed to consider the social affections that bind communities together. Ruskin articulated an extended metaphor of household and family, drawing on [[Plato]] and [[Xenophon]] to demonstrate the communal and sometimes sacrificial nature of true economics.&lt;ref&gt;For the sources of Ruskin's social and political analysis: James Clark Sherburne, ''John Ruskin or The Ambiguities of Abundance: A Study in Social and Economic Criticism'' (Harvard University Press, 1972 {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Ruskin, all economies, and all societies are ideally underwritten by a politics of [[social justice]]. Ruskin's ideas influenced the concept of the "[[social economy]]" characterised by networks of charitable, co-operative and other [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisations]].

The essays were originally published in consecutive monthly instalments of the new ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'' between August and November 1860 and was published in a single volume in 1862.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.15–118}} However, its editor, [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], was forced to abandon the series by the outcry of its largely conservative readership and the fears of a nervous publisher ([[Smith, Elder &amp; Co.]]). The press reaction was hostile, and Ruskin was, he claimed, "reprobated in a violent manner".&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 4.122n. For the press reaction: J. L. Bradley (ed.) ''Ruskin: The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1984), pp. 273–89.&lt;/ref&gt; His father also strongly disapproved.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=36.415}} Others were enthusiastic, including Ruskin's friend, [[Thomas Carlyle]], who wrote, "I have read your paper with exhilaration... such a thing flung suddenly into half a million dull British heads... will do a great deal of good."&lt;ref&gt;Q. in James S. Dearden, ''John Ruskin'' (Shire Publications Ltd., 2004), pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin's political ideas, and ''[[Unto This Last]]'' in particular, later proved highly influential, praised and paraphrased in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] by [[Mohandas Gandhi]], a wide range of autodidacts, the economist [[John A. Hobson]] and many of the founders of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour party]].&lt;ref&gt;For the influence of Ruskin's social and political thought: Gill Cockram, ''Ruskin and Social Reform: Ethics and Economics in the Victorian Age'' (I.B. Tauris, 2007) and Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: The Social and Political Legacies of a Victorian Prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  Ruskin believed in a hierarchical social structure. He wrote "I was, and my father was before me, a violent Tory of the old school."&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn  27.167 and 35.13.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed in duties and responsibilities to, and under, God, and while he sought to improve the conditions of the poor, he opposed attempts to level social differences and sought to resolve social inequalities by abandoning capitalism in favour of a co-operative structure of society based on obedience and benevolent philanthropy, rooted in the agricultural economy.

My continual aim has been to show the eternal superiority of some men to others, sometimes even of one man to all others; and to show also the advisability of appointing such persons or person to guide, to lead, or on occasion even to compel and subdue, their inferiors, according to their own better knowledge and wiser will. |source=&lt;small&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 17.34&lt;/small&gt;}}

Ruskin's explorations of nature and aesthetics in the fifth and final volume of  ''[[Modern Painters]]'' focused on [[Giorgione]], [[Paolo Veronese]], [[Titian]] and [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]]. Ruskin asserted that the components of the greatest art are held together, like human communities, in quasi-organic unity. Competitive struggle is destructive. Uniting ''[[Modern Painters]]'' V and ''[[Unto This Last]]'' is Ruskin's "Law of Help":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/notes/galib64.htm |title=Ruskin MP I Notes |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date=6 July 2002 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=Government and cooperation are in all things and eternally the laws of life. Anarchy and competition, eternally, and in all things, the laws of death. |source=&lt;small&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 7.207 and 17.25.&lt;/small&gt;}}

Ruskin's next work on political economy, redefining some of the basic terms of the discipline, also ended prematurely, when ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'', under the editorship of [[James Anthony Froude]], cut short his ''Essays on Political Economy'' (1862–63) (later collected as ''Munera Pulveris'' (1872)).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.129–298}}  Ruskin explored further political themes in ''Time and Tide'' (1867),{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.309–484}} his letters to Thomas Dixon, the cork-cutter in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear]] with a well-established interest in literary and artistic matters. In these letters, Ruskin promoted honesty in work and exchange, just relations in employment and the need for co-operation.

Ruskin's sense of politics was not confined to theory. On his father's death in 1864, Ruskin inherited a considerable fortune of between £120,000 and £157,000 (the exact figure is disputed).&lt;ref&gt;Francis O' Gorman gives the figure as £120,000, in idem, ''John Ruskin'' (Sutton Publishing Ltd., 1999) p. 62 as does James S. Dearden (who adds that property, including paintings, was valued at £3000), in idem, ''John Ruskin'' (Shire Publications Ltd., 2004), p. 37. Robert Hewison's ''Oxford [[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' entry for Ruskin, however, states £157,000 plus £10,000 in pictures (section: "A Mid-Life Crisis").&lt;/ref&gt; This considerable inheritance from the father he described on his tombstone as "an entirely honest merchant"{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.lxxvii}} gave him the means to engage in personal philanthropy and practical schemes of social amelioration. One of his first actions was to support the housing work of [[Octavia Hill]] (originally one of his art pupils), by buying property in [[Marylebone]] for her philanthropic housing scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Darley, ''Octavia Hill: A Life'' (Constable, 1990) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Ruskin's endeavours extended to a shop selling pure tea in any quantity desired at 29 Paddington Street, [[Paddington]] (giving employment to two former Ruskin family servants) and crossing-sweepings to keep the area around the [[British Museum]] clean and tidy. Modest as these practical schemes were, they represented a symbolic challenge to the existing state of society. Yet his greatest practical experiments would come in his later years.

===Lectures in the 1860s===
Ruskin lectured widely in the 1860s, giving the [[Rede lecture]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1867, for example.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=19.163-94}} He spoke at the [[British Institution]] on 'Modern Art', the Working Men's Institute, [[Camberwell]] on "Work" and the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]] on 'War'. Ruskin's widely admired lecture, ''Traffic'', on the relations of taste and morality, was delivered in April 1864 at [[Bradford]] Town Hall, to which he had been invited because of a local debate about the style of a new Exchange building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/block1.html |title=Moral Taste in Ruskin's "Traffic" |website=Victorianweb.org |date=13 November 2006 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I do not care about this Exchange," Ruskin told his audience, "because ''you'' don't!"{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.433}} These last three lectures were published in ''The Crown of Wild Olive'' (1866).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.383–533}}

[[File:Library Walk 29.JPG|thumb|"For all books are divisible into two classes: the books of the hour, and the books of all time" – ''Sesame and Lilies'']]
The lectures that comprised ''Sesame and Lilies'' (published 1865), delivered in December 1864 at the town halls at [[Rusholme]] and [[Manchester]], are essentially concerned with education and ideal conduct. "Of Kings' Treasuries" (in support of a library fund) explored issues of reading practice, literature (books of the hour vs. books of all time), cultural value and public education. "Of Queens' Gardens" (supporting a school fund) focused on the role of women, asserting their rights and duties in education, according them responsibility for the household and, by extension, for providing the human compassion that must balance a social order dominated by men. This book proved to be one of Ruskin's most popular books, and was regularly awarded as a [[Sunday School]] prize.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.19-187}} The book's reception over time, however, has been more mixed, and twentieth-century feminists have taken aim at "Of Queens' Gardens" particularly as an effort to "subvert the new heresy" of [[women's rights]] by confining women to the domestic sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Millett, Sexual Politics.  New York: Doubleday and Co., 1970, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life (1869–1900)==

===Oxford's first Slade Professor of Fine Art===
[[File:Vanity Fair Caricature of Ruskin.jpg|left|thumb|Caricature by [[Adriano Cecioni]] published in ''[[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1872]]
Ruskin was unanimously appointed the first [[Slade Professor of Fine Art]] at [[Oxford University]] in August 1869, largely through the offices of his friend, [[Henry Acland]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hilton, ''John Ruskin: The Later Years'' (Yale University Press, 2000), pp. 165–68.&lt;/ref&gt; He delivered his inaugural lecture on his 51st birthday in 1870, at the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] to a larger-than-expected audience. It was here that he said, "The art of any country is the exponent of its social and political virtues.". Thus, its effect on each man should be visible and moving.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:121)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cecil Rhodes]] cherished a long-hand copy of the lecture, believing that it supported his own view of the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Symonds, 'Oxford and the Empire', in [[M. G. Brock]] and M. C. Curthoys (eds.), ''The History of the University of Oxford, vol. VII: Nineteenth-Century Oxford, part 2'' (Oxford University Press, 2000), pp. 689–716, specifically p. 691.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871, John Ruskin founded his own art school at [[Oxford]], [[The Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oua.ox.ac.uk/holdings/Ruskin%20School%20of%20Art%20RS.pdf |title=Oxford University Archives &amp;#124; Home |website=Oua.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally accommodated within the [[Ashmolean Museum]] but now occupies premises on "the High" (High Street). Ruskin endowed the drawing mastership with £5000 of his own money. He also established a large collection of drawings, watercolours and other materials (over 800 frames) with which to illustrate his lectures. The School challenged the orthodox, mechanical methodology of the government schools (the "South Kensington System").&lt;ref name="See Robert Hewison 1996"&gt;See Robert Hewison, ''Ruskin and Oxford: The Art of Education'' (Clarendon Press, 1996) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His lectures were often so popular that they had to be given twice—once for the students, and again for the public. Most of them were eventually published (see Bibliography). He lectured on a wide range of subjects at Oxford, his interpretation of "Art" encompassing almost every conceivable area of study, including wood and metal engraving (''Ariadne Florentina''), the relation of science to art (''The Eagle's Nest'') and sculpture (''Aratra Pentelici''). His lectures ranged through myth, ornithology, geology, nature-study and literature. "The teaching of Art...," Ruskin wrote, "is the teaching of all things."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=29.86}} Ruskin was never careful about offending his employer. When he criticised [[Michelangelo]] in a lecture in June 1871 it was seen as an attack on the large collection of that artist's work in the [[Ashmolean Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis O' Gorman,  ''John Ruskin'' (Pocket Biographies) (Sutton Publishing Ltd., 1999) p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most controversial, from the point of view of the University authorities, spectators and the national press, was the digging scheme on [[Ferry Hinksey Road]] at [[North Hinksey]], near [[Oxford]], instigated by Ruskin in 1874, and continuing into 1875, which involved undergraduates in a road-mending scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/3780 |title=John Ruskin green plaque |publisher=Open Plaques |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was motivated in part by a desire to teach the virtues of wholesome manual labour. Some of the diggers, which included [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Alfred Milner]] and Ruskin's future secretary and biographer, [[W. G. Collingwood]], were profoundly influenced by the experience: notably [[Arnold Toynbee]], Leonard Montefiore and [[Alexander Robertson MacEwen]]. It helped to foster a public service ethic that was later given expression in the [[settlement movement|university settlements]],&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: The Social and Political Legacies of a Victorian Prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 103–09.&lt;/ref&gt; and was keenly celebrated by the founders of [[Ruskin College|Ruskin Hall, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, "Ruskin the Worker: Hinksey and the Origins of Ruskin Hall, Oxford" in ''Ruskin Review and Bulletin'', vol. 4, no. 3 (Autumn 2008), pp. 19–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, Ruskin resigned from Oxford, but resumed his Professorship in 1883, resigning again in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hilton, ''John Ruskin: The Latter Years'' (Yale University Press, 2000), pp. 399–400, 509–10.&lt;/ref&gt; He gave his reason as opposition to [[vivisection]],&lt;ref&gt;Jed Mayer, "Ruskin, Vivisection, and Scientific Knowledge" in ''Nineteenth-Century Prose'', vol. 35, no. 1 (Spring 2008) (Guest Editor, Sharon Aronofsky Weltman), pp. 200–22.&lt;/ref&gt; but he had increasingly been in conflict with the University authorities, who refused to expand his [[Ruskin School of Drawing|Drawing School]].&lt;ref name="See Robert Hewison 1996"/&gt; He was also suffering increasingly poor health.

===''Fors Clavigera'' and the Whistler Libel Case===
In January 1871, the month before Ruskin started to lecture the wealthy undergraduates at [[Oxford University]], he began his (originally) monthly "letters to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain" under the title ''[[Fors Clavigera]]'' (1871–84). (The letters were published irregularly after the 87th instalment in March 1878.) These letters were personal, dealt with every subject in his [[Work of art|oeuvre]], and were written in a variety of styles, reflecting his mood and circumstances. From 1873, Ruskin had full control over all his publications, having established George Allen as his sole publisher (see [[Allen &amp; Unwin]]).

In the July 1877 letter of ''Fors Clavigera'', Ruskin launched a scathing attack on paintings by [[James McNeill Whistler]] exhibited at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]]. He found particular fault with [[Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket|''Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket'']], and accused Whistler of "ask[ing] two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public's face".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=29.160}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n1_v81/ai_13295552 Linda Merrill, ''A Pot of Paint: Aesthetics on Trial in Whistler v. Ruskin''. – book review, ''Art in America'', January 1993, by Wendy Steiner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827175109/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n1_v81/ai_13295552 |date=27 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whistler filed a libel suit against Ruskin. Whistler won the case, which went to trial in Ruskin's absence in 1878 (he was ill), but the jury awarded damages of only one [[British farthing coin|farthing]] to the artist. Court costs were split between the two parties. Ruskin's were paid by public subscription, but Whistler was bankrupted within six months. The episode tarnished Ruskin's reputation, however, and may have accelerated his mental decline.&lt;ref&gt;For an exploration of Ruskin's rejection of dominant artistic trends in his later life, see Clive Wilmer, "Ruskin and the Challenge of Modernity" in ''Nineteenth-Century Prose'', vol. 38, no. 2 (Fall 2011), pp. 13–34.&lt;/ref&gt; It did nothing to mitigate Ruskin's consistently exaggerated sense of failure in persuading his readers to share in his own keenly felt priorities.&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 29.469, the passage in ''Sesame and Lilies'' printed in "blood-red".&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Guild of St George===
Ruskin founded his utopian society, the [[Guild of St George]], in 1871 (although originally it was called St George's Fund, and then St George's Company, before becoming the Guild in 1878). Its aims and objectives were articulated in ''[[Fors Clavigera]]''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=27–29}} A communitarian venture, it had a hierarchical structure, with Ruskin as its Master, and dedicated members called "Companions" whose first loyalty was nearly always to Ruskin personally.&lt;ref&gt;For the Guild's constitution and articles of association: Cook and Wedderburn  30.3–12&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin wished to show that contemporary life could still be enjoyed in the countryside, with land being farmed traditionally, with minimal mechanical assistance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1940&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324235259/https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw%3A1m1940&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF |date=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With a tithe (or personal donation) of £7,000, Ruskin acquired some land and a remarkable collection of books, art and other precious and beautiful objects.&lt;ref&gt;On the origins of the Guild: Edith Hope Scott, ''Ruskin's Guild of St George'' (Methuen, 1931).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin purchased land initially in [[Totley]], near [[Sheffield]], but the agricultural element of his scheme met with only moderate success after many difficulties. Donations of land from wealthy and committed Companions eventually placed land and properties in the Guild's care: [[Wyre Forest]], near [[Bewdley]], Worcestershire;&lt;ref&gt;See Peter Wardle and Cedric Quayle, ''Ruskin and Bewdley'' (Brentham Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barmouth]], in [[Gwynedd]], north-west [[Wales]]; [[Cloughton]], in [[North Yorkshire]]; and [[Westmill]] in Hertfordshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utopia-britannica.org.uk/pages/Ruskinland.htm |title=Ruskinland |website=Utopia-britannica.org.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle, Ruskin worked out a scheme for different grades of "Companion", wrote codes of practice, described styles of dress and even designed the Guild's own coins.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=28.417–38 and 28.13–29}} Ruskin wished to see St George's Schools established, and published various volumes to aid its teaching (his ''Bibliotheca Pastorum'' or ''Shepherd's Library''), but the schools themselves were never established.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Atwood, ''Ruskin's Educational Ideals'' (Ashgate, 2011), pp. 151–64.&lt;/ref&gt; (In the 1880s, in a venture loosely related to the ''Bibliotheca'', he supported [[Francesca Alexander]], publishing some of her tales of peasant life.) In reality, the Guild, which still exists today as a charitable organisation, has only ever operated on a small scale.&lt;ref&gt;For a short, illustrated history of the Guild: James S. Dearden, ''John Ruskin's Guild of St George'' (Guild of St George, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin also wished to see traditional rural handicrafts revived. St. George's Mill was established at [[Laxey]], on the [[Isle of Man]] producing cloth goods. The Guild also encouraged independent, but allied, efforts in spinning and weaving at [[Langdale]], in other parts of the [[Lake District]] and elsewhere, producing linen and other goods exhibited by the [[Home Arts and Industries Association]] and similar organisations.&lt;ref&gt;Sara E. Haslam, ''John Ruskin and the Lakeland Arts Revival, 1880–1920'' (Merton Priory Press Ltd., 2004) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sheffield]], in 1875, Ruskin established a museum for the working men of that city, and surrounding areas. Originally situated in [[Walkley]] and curated by Henry Swan, St. George's Museum housed a large collection of art works (original pencil sketches, architectural drawings, watercolours, copies of Old Masters and so on), minerals, geological specimens, manuscripts (many of them medieval in origin) and a multitude of other beautiful and precious items.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Barnes, ''Ruskin and Sheffield'' (Sheffield City Council, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin had written in ''[[Modern Painters]]'' III (1856) that, "the greatest thing a human soul ever does in this world is to ''see'' something, and to tell what it ''saw'' in a plain way."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=5.333}} Through the Museum, Ruskin aimed to bring to the eyes of the working man many of the sights and experiences otherwise confined to the wealthy who could afford to travel through Europe. The original Museum has been virtually recreated online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruskinatwalkley.org/ |title=Ruskin at Walkley |publisher=Ruskin at Walkley |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, the Museum relocated to [[Meersbrook Park]]. The collection is currently (2011) on display at [[Sheffield]]'s [[Millennium Galleries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museums-sheffield.org.uk/collections/ruskin-collection |title=eMuseum |website=Museums-sheffield.org.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rose La Touche===
[[File:Portrait of Rose La Touche 1861 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''Rose La Touche'', as sketched by Ruskin]]
Ruskin had been introduced to the wealthy Irish La Touche family by [[Louisa, Marchioness of Waterford]]. Maria La Touche, a minor Irish poet and novelist, asked Ruskin to teach her daughters drawing and painting in 1858. [[Rose La Touche]] was ten, Ruskin nearly 39. Ruskin gradually fell in love with her. Their first meeting came at a time when Ruskin's own religious faith was under strain. This always caused difficulties for the staunchly Protestant La Touche family who at various times prevented the two from meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dunlop, ''Plantation of Renown: The Story of the La Touche Family of Harristown and the Baptist Church at Brannockstown in Co. Kildar''e [1970]. Revised and enlarged edition, 1982; "Ruskin‟s "Wild Rose of Kildare", pp. 29–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's love for Rose was a cause alternately of great joy and deep depression for him, and always a source of anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;See Van Akin Burd, ''John Ruskin and Rose La Touche: Her unpublished Diaries of 1861 and 1867'' (Clarendon Press, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin proposed to her on or near her eighteenth birthday in 1867, but she asked him to wait three years for an answer, until she was 21. A chance meeting at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1869 was one of the few occasions they came into personal contact thereafter. She finally rejected him in 1872, but they still occasionally met, for the final time on 15 February 1875. After a long illness, she died on 25 May 1875, at the age of 27. These events plunged Ruskin into despair and led to increasingly severe bouts of mental illness involving a number of breakdowns and delirious visions. The first of these had occurred in 1871 at [[Matlock, Derbyshire]], a town and a county that he knew from his boyhood travels, whose flora, fauna, and minerals helped to form and reinforce his appreciation and understanding of nature. Ruskin turned to [[spiritualism]] and was by turns comforted and disturbed by what he believed was his ability to communicate with the dead Rose.

===Travel guides===
Ruskin continued to travel, studying the landscapes, buildings and art of Europe. In May 1870 and June 1872 he admired [[Vittore Carpaccio|Carpaccio]]'s ''St Ursula'' in [[Venice]], a vision of which, associated with [[Rose La Touche]] would haunt him, described in the pages of ''[[Fors Clavigera|Fors]]''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=27.344}} In 1874, on his tour of Italy, Ruskin visited [[Sicily]], the furthest he ever travelled.

Ruskin embraced the emerging literary forms, the travel guide (and gallery guide), writing new works, and adapting old ones "to give," he said, "what guidance I may to travallers..."&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 23.293. For further study, see Keith Hanley and John K. Walton, ''Constructing Cultural Tourism: John Ruskin and the Tourist Gaze'' (Channel View Publications, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Stones of Venice'' was revised, edited and issued in a new "Travellers' Edition" in 1879. Ruskin directed his readers, the would-be traveller, to look with his cultural gaze at the landscapes, buildings and art of France and Italy: ''Mornings in Florence'' (1875–77), ''The Bible of Amiens'' (1880–85) (a close study of its sculpture and a wider history), ''St Mark's Rest'' (1877–84) and ''A Guide to the Principal Pictures in ... Venice'' (1877).

===Return to belief===
In December 1875, Ruskin's desire for a meaningful universe and a life after death, both for himself and his loved ones, brought him back to Christianity. He never publicly related the date and cause of his return to belief, but his letters demonstrate that on 20 December 1875, a spiritualist seance at Broadlands convinced him that the ghost of Rose La Touche had appeared at his side.

While the direct link between Ruskin's faith and this event cannot be made, his subsequent writings demonstrate a return to Christianity. In ''Praeterita'' he affirms that [[Christ]] will return "and judge every man according to his work". These beliefs were often unquestioning, and even anti-intellectual. An example of this is a letter of 1876, in which he did "not think the question of the Trinity or Unity is one for Man to discuss."&lt;ref name="victorianweb.org"/&gt;

===Final writings===
[[File:John Ruskin, 1882.jpg|thumb|John Ruskin in 1882]]
In the 1880s, Ruskin returned to some literature and themes that had been among his favourites since childhood. He wrote about [[Walter Scott]], [[Lord Byron|Byron]] and [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] in ''Fiction, Fair and Foul'' (1880){{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=34.265–397}} and returned to meteorological observations in his lectures, ''The Storm-Cloud of the Nineteenth-Century'' (1884),{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=34.7–80}} describing the apparent effects of industrialisation on weather patterns. Ruskin's ''Storm-Cloud'' has been seen as foreshadowing environmentalism and related concerns in the 20th and 21st centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wheeler (ed.), ''Ruskin and Environment: The Storm-Cloud of the Nineteenth Century'' (Manchester University Press, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's prophetic writings were also tied to his emotions, and his more general (ethical) dissatisfaction with the modern world with which he now felt almost completely out of sympathy.

His last great work was his autobiography, ''Praeterita'' (1885–89){{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=35.5-562}} (meaning, 'Of Past Things'), a highly personalised, selective, eloquent but incomplete account of aspects of his life, the preface of which was written in his childhood nursery at [[Herne Hill]].

The period from the late 1880s was one of steady and inexorable decline. Gradually it became too difficult for him to travel to Europe. He suffered a complete collapse on his final tour, which included [[Beauvais]], [[Sallanches]] and [[Venice]], in 1888. The emergence and dominance of the [[Aesthetic movement]] and [[Impressionism]] distanced Ruskin from the modern art world, his ideas on the social utility of art contrasting with the "l'art pour l'art" or "art for art's sake" that was beginning to dominate. His later writings were increasingly seen as irrelevant, especially as he seemed to be more interested in book illustrators such as [[Kate Greenaway]] than in modern art. He also attacked [[Darwinism|Darwinian theory]] with increasing violence, although he knew and respected [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] personally.

===Brantwood===
[[File:John Ruskin's grave, and family plot - geograph.org.uk - 1231315.jpg|thumb|Grave of John Ruskin, in [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]] churchyard]]
In August 1871, Ruskin purchased from [[W. J. Linton]] the then somewhat dilapidated [[Brantwood]], on the shores of [[Coniston Water]], in the English [[Lake District]], paying £1500. It remains open to visitors today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brantwood.org.uk/ |title=Museum, Arts Centre &amp; Self Catering Accommodation Coniston |website=Brantwood.org.uk |date=14 April 2017 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Ruskin's main home from 1872 until his death. His estate provided a site for more of his practical schemes and experiments: an ice house was built, the gardens were comprehensively rearranged, he oversaw the construction of a larger harbour (from where he rowed his boat, the ''Jumping Jenny''), and altered the house (adding a dining room, turret to his bedroom to give a panoramic view of the lake, and later expanding further to accommodate his relatives). He built a reservoir, and redirected the waterfall down the hills, adding a slate seat that faced the tumbling stream rather than the lake, so that he could closely observe the fauna and flora of the hillside.&lt;ref&gt;For an illustrated history of Brantwood, see James S. Dearden, ''Brantwood: The Story of John Ruskin's Coniston Home'' (Ruskin Foundation, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ruskin's 80th birthday was widely celebrated in 1899 (various Ruskin societies presenting him with a congratulatory address), Ruskin was scarcely aware of it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1674&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324235342/https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw%3A1m1674&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF |date=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at [[Brantwood]] from influenza on 20 January 1900 at the age of 80. He was buried five days later in the churchyard at [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]], according to his wishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lookandlearn.com/history-images/M076100/John-Ruskins-Grave-at-Coniston?img=163&amp;search=RANDOM&amp;cat=&amp;bool=and |title= Look and Learn History Picture Library |website=Lookandlearn.com |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he had grown weaker, suffering prolonged bouts of mental illness (thought in retrospect to have been [[CADASIL syndrome]]), he had been looked after by his second cousin, Joan(na) Severn (formerly "companion" to Ruskin's mother) and she inherited his estate. "Joanna's Care" was the eloquent final chapter of his memoir which he dedicated to her as a fitting tribute.&lt;ref&gt;For Ruskin's relationship with Joan Severn, see ''John Ruskin's Correspondence with Joan Severn: Sense and Nonsense Letters'' ed. Rachel Dickinson (Legenda, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Joan Severn, together with Ruskin's secretary, [[W. G. Collingwood]], and his eminent American friend, [[Charles Eliot Norton]], were executors to his Will. [[E. T. Cook]] and Alexander Wedderburn edited the monumental 39-volume ''Library Edition'' of Ruskin's ''Works'', the last volume of which, an index, attempts to articulate the complex interconnectedness of Ruskin's thought. They all acted together to guard, and even control, Ruskin's public and personal reputation.&lt;ref&gt;James Spates has written about the effects of this, based on the research work of Helen Viljoen. See James L. Spates, 'John Ruskin‟s Dark Star: New Lights on His Life Based on the Unpublished Biographical Materials and Research of Helen Gill Viljoen', ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'', vol. 82, no. 1, Spring 2000 [published 2001], 135–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The centenary of Ruskin's birth was keenly celebrated in 1919, but his reputation was already in decline and sank further in the fifty years that followed.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: The Social and Political Legacies of a Victorian Prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 246–48.&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of Ruskin's home were dispersed in a series of sales at auction, and [[Brantwood]] itself was bought in 1932 by the educationist and Ruskin enthusiast, collector and memorialist, [[John Howard Whitehouse]].&lt;ref&gt;See James S. Dearden, ''Ruskin, Bembridge and Brantwood: the Growth of the Whitehouse Collection'' (Ryburn, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, it was opened to the public as a permanent memorial to Ruskin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brantwood.org.uk/temp.../History%20of%20Brantwood%202pp.doc ]{{dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal appearance===
In middle age, and at his prime as a lecturer, Ruskin was described as slim, perhaps a little short,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander MacEwen, who attended Ruskin's lectures at Oxford, reported that the papers described him thus. See David Smith Cairns, ''Life and times of Alexander Robertson MacEwen, D.D'' (Hodder and Stoughton, 1925), pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; with an aquiline nose and brilliant, piercing blue eyes. Often sporting a double-breasted waistcoat, a high collar and, when necessary, a frock coat, he also wore his trademark blue neckcloth.&lt;ref&gt;See [[H. W. Nevinson]], ''Changes and Chances'' (James Nisbet, 1923), pp. 53–55 and [[J. A. Spender]], ''Life, Journalism and Politics'' (Cassell &amp; Co., 1927), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1878 he cultivated an increasingly long beard, and took on the appearance of an "Old Testament" prophet.

In 1884, the 17-year-old [[Beatrix Potter]] spotted Ruskin at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] exhibition. She wrote in her journal, "Mr Ruskin was one of the most ridiculous figures I have seen. A very old hat, much necktie and aged coat buttoned up on his neck, humpbacked, not particularly clean looking. He had on high boots, and one of his trousers was tucked up on the top of one. He became aware of this half way round the room, and stood on one leg to put it right, but in doing so hitched up the other trouser worse than the first one had been."&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Linder, ed. (1966) ''The Journal of Beatrix Potter''. London: Frederick Warne &amp; Co. p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

===International===
Ruskin's influence reached across the world. [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] described him as "one of the most remarkable men not only of England and of our generation, but of all countries and times" and quoted extensively from him, rendering his words into Russian.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, ''Ruskin and Tolstoy'' (Guild of St George, 2010) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcel Proust|Proust]] not only admired Ruskin but helped translate his works into French.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia J. Gamble,  ''Proust as Interpreter of Ruskin. The Seven Lamps of Translation'' (Summa Publications, 2002) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] wrote of the "magic spell" cast on him by ''[[Unto This Last]]'' and paraphrased the work in Gujarati, calling it ''[[Sarvodaya]]'', "The Advancement of All".{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} In Japan, Ryuzo Mikimoto actively collaborated in Ruskin's translation. He commissioned sculptures and sundry commemorative items, and incorporated Ruskinian rose motifs in the jewellery produced by his pearl empire. He established the Ruskin Society of Tokyo and his children built a dedicated library to house his Ruskin collection.&lt;ref&gt;Masami Kimura, "Japanese Interest in Ruskin: Some Historical Trends" in Robert E. Rhodes and Del Ivan Janik (eds.), ''Studies in Ruskin: Essays in Honor of Van Akin Burd'' (Ohio University Press, 1982), pp. 215–44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/catalogue-of-the-ryuzo-mikimoto-collection-ruskin-library-tokyo-2004/oclc/56923207 |title=Catalogue of the Ryuzo Mikimoto Collection : Ruskin Library, Tokyo 2004 |website=WorldCat.org |date=1 April 2017 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ruskin Cannery.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cannery operation in the Ruskin Cooperative, 1896]]
A number of [[Utopian socialism|Utopian socialist]] [[Ruskin Colonies]] attempted to put his political ideals into practice. These communities included [[Ruskin, Florida]], [[Ruskin, British Columbia]] and the [[Ruskin Colony|Ruskin Commonwealth Association]], a colony which existed in [[Dickson County, Tennessee]] from 1894 to 1899.

Ruskin's work has been translated into numerous languages including, in addition to those already mentioned (Russian, French, Japanese): German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Hungarian, Polish, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Chinese, Welsh and even [[Esperanto]] and [[Gikuyu language|Gikuyu]].

===Art, architecture and literature===
Theorists and practitioners in a broad range of disciplines acknowledged their debt to Ruskin. Architects including [[Le Corbusier]], [[Louis Sullivan]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Walter Gropius]] incorporated Ruskin's ideas in their work.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Daniels and Geoff Brandwood (ed.), ''Ruskin and Architecture'' (Spire Books, 2003) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers as diverse as [[Oscar Wilde]], [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[Ezra Pound]] felt Ruskin's influence.&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Collingwood, Life and Work of John Ruskin (Methuen, 1900) p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; The American poet [[Marianne Moore]] was an enthusiastic Ruskin reader. Art historians and critics, among them [[Herbert Read]], [[Roger Fry]] and [[Wilhelm Worringer]] knew Ruskin's work well.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Cianci and Peter Nicholls (eds.)  ''Ruskin and Modernism'' (Palgrave, 2001) and Toni Cerutti (ed.) ''Ruskin and the Twentieth Century: the modernity of Ruskinism'' (Edizioni Mercurio, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Admirers ranged from the British-born American watercolourist and engraver, [[John William Hill]] to the sculptor-designer, printmaker and utopianist, [[Eric Gill]]. Aside from [[E. T. Cook]], Ruskin's editor and biographer, other leading British journalists influenced by Ruskin include [[J. A. Spender]], and the war correspondent, [[H. W. Nevinson]].

===Craft and conservation===
[[William Morris]] and [[C. R. Ashbee]] (the Guild of Handicraft) were keen disciples, and through them Ruskin's legacy can be traced in the [[arts and crafts movement]]. Ruskin's ideas on preservation of open spaces and conservation of historic buildings and places inspired his friends, [[Octavia Hill]] and [[Hardwicke Rawnsley]], to help found the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/octaviahill Download Samuel Jones (ed.), ''The Enduring Relevance of Octavia Hill''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618093500/http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/octaviahill |date=18 June 2012 }} and see specifically, Robert Hewison, "'You are doing some of the work that I ought to do': Octavia Hill and Ruskinian values", pp. 57–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Society and education===
Pioneers of [[urban planning|town planning]], such as [[Thomas Coglan Horsfall]] and [[Patrick Geddes]] called Ruskin an inspiration and invoked his ideas in their writings. The same is true for the founders of the [[garden city movement]], [[Ebenezer Howard]] and [[Raymond Unwin]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael H. Lang ''Designing Utopia: John Ruskin's Urban Vision for Britain and America'' (Black Rose Books Ltd., 1999) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Carpenter]]'s community in Millthorpe, Derbyshire was partly inspired by Ruskin, and John Kenworthy's colony at [[Purleigh]], briefly a refuge for the [[Doukhobor]]s, combined Ruskin's ideas and Tolstoy's.

The most prolific collector of Ruskiniana was [[John Howard Whitehouse]], who saved Ruskin's home, [[Brantwood]], and opened it as a permanent Ruskin memorial. Inspired by Ruskin's educational ideals, Whitehouse established [[Bembridge School]], on the [[Isle of Wight]], and ran it along Ruskinian lines. Educationists from William Jolly to [[Michael Ernest Sadler]] wrote about and appreciated Ruskin's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;For a full discussion of Ruskin and education, see Sara Atwood,  ''Ruskin's Educational Ideals'' (Ashgate, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruskin College]], an educational establishment in Oxford originally intended for working men, was named after him by its American founders, Walter Vrooman and [[Charles A.

Ruskin's innovative publishing experiment, conducted by his one-time [[Working Men's College]] pupil, George Allen, whose business was eventually merged to become [[Allen &amp; Unwin]], anticipated the establishment of the [[Net Book Agreement]].

Ruskin's Drawing Collection, a collection of 1470 works of art which he gathered as learning aids for the [[Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art]] which he founded at Oxford, is still in the possession of the school, now the Ashmolean Museum.

===Politics and economics===
Ruskin was an inspiration for many [[Christian socialism|Christian socialists]], and his ideas informed the work of economists such as [[William Smart (economist)|William Smart]] and [[J. A. Hobson]], and the positivist, [[Frederic Harrison]].&lt;ref&gt;Gill Cockram, ''Ruskin and Social Reform: Ethics and Economics in the Victorian Age'' (Tauris, 2007) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin was discussed in university extension classes, and in reading circles and societies formed in his name. He helped to inspire the [[settlement movement]] in Britain and the United States. Resident workers at [[Toynbee Hall]] such as the later civil servants Hubert Llewellyn Smith and [[William Beveridge]] (author of the [[Beveridge Report|Report ... on Social Insurance and Allied Services]]), and the future Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] acknowledged their debt to Ruskin as they helped to found the British [[welfare state]]. More of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]]'s earliest members acknowledged his significance than mentioned [[Karl Marx]] or the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: the social and political legacies of a Victorian prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011) and Dinah Birch (ed.), ''Ruskin and the Dawn of the Modern'' (Oxford University Press, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Ruskin's works have also influenced [[Phillip Blond]] and the [[Red Tory]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Red Tory intrigues and infuriates|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/30/phillip-blond-red-tory-respublica | work=The Guardian | first=Madeleine|last=Bunting|date=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many streets, buildings, organisations and institutions bear his name. [[The Priory Ruskin Academy]] in Grantham, Lincolnshire, [[Anglia Ruskin University]] in [[Chelmsford]] and [[Cambridge]] traces its origins to the Cambridge School of Art, at the foundation of which Ruskin spoke in 1858. [[John Ruskin College]], South Croydon, is named after him. The Ruskin Literary and Debating Society, (founded in 1900 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada), the oldest surviving club of its type, still promoting the development of literary knowledge and public speaking today. The Ruskin Art Club is the oldest ladies club in Los Angeles. In addition, there is the [[Ruskin Pottery]], [[Ruskin House]], Croydon and [[Ruskin Hall]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]].

[[Ruskin, Florida]], United States—site of one of the short-lived American [[Ruskin Colleges]]—is named for John Ruskin. There is a mural of Ruskin titled, "Head, Heart And Hands" on a building across from the Ruskin Post Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5RcPIY4KU0 |title=Ruskin Community Mural |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=4 March 2009 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000, scholarly research has focused on aspects of Ruskin's legacy, including his impact on the sciences; [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]] and [[Oliver Lodge]] admired him. Two major academic projects have looked at Ruskin and [[cultural tourism]] (investigating, for example, Ruskin's links with [[Thomas Cook]]);&lt;ref&gt;Keith Hanley and John K. Walton, ''Constructing Cultural Tourism: John Ruskin and the Tourist Gaze'' (Channel View Publications, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; the other focuses on Ruskin and the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Newey and Jeffrey Richards ''John Ruskin and the Victorian Theatre'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist and media theorist, [[David Gauntlett]], argues that Ruskin's notions of craft can be traced to today's online community at YouTube and throughout [[Web 2.0]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Gauntlett]] ''Making Is Connecting: the social meaning of creativity from DIY and knitting to YouTube and Web 2.0'' (Polity, 2011), pp. 25–36, 217–19; specifically on YouTube, see pp. 85–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, architectural theorist [[Lars Spuybroek]] has argued that Ruskin's understanding of the Gothic as a combination of two types of variation, rough savageness and smooth changefulness, opens up a whole new way of thinking leading to digital and so-called parametric design.&lt;ref&gt;Lars Spuybroek, ''The Sympathy of Things: Ruskin and the Ecology of Design'' (V2_NAI Publishers, 2011), pp. 65–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable modern-day Ruskin enthusiasts include the writers [[Geoffrey Hill]] and [[Charles Tomlinson]], and the politicians, [[Patrick Cormack]], [[Frank Judd]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/frank-judd/26799 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=22 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012145610/http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/frank-judd/26799 |archivedate=12 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Field (British politician)|Frank Field]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Field (British politician)|Frank Field]] spoke at the [[Art Workers Guild]] on Ruskin, 6 February 2010.

''There is no wealth but life: Ruskin in the 21st Century'' (Ruskin To-Day, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Glancey]] at ''[[The Guardian]]'' and Andrew Hill at the ''[[Financial Times]]'' have both written about Ruskin,&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Hill, ''Introduction'' in John Ruskin, ''Unto This Last'' (Pallas Athene, 2010), pp. 9–16.&lt;/ref&gt; as has the broadcaster [[Melvyn Bragg]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Melvyn Bragg]], ''Foreword'' in John Ruskin, ''On Genius'' (Hesperus, 2011), pp. vii–xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and criticism==

Ruskin wrote over 250 works, initially art criticism and history, but expanding to cover topics ranging over science, geology, ornithology, [[literary criticism]], the environmental effects of pollution, mythology, travel, political economy and social reform. After his death Ruskin's works were collected in the 39-volume "Library Edition", completed in 1912 by his friends [[Edward Tyas Cook]] and Alexander Wedderburn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/notes/hcookwed01.htm |title=Ruskin MP I Notes |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range and quantity of Ruskin's writing, and its complex, allusive and associative method of expression, causes certain difficulties. In 1898, [[John A. Hobson]] observed that in attempting to summarise Ruskin's thought, and by extracting passages from across his work, "the spell of his eloquence is broken".&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Hobson|J. A. Hobson]], ''John Ruskin: Social Reformer'' (J. Nisbet &amp; Co., 1898), p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clive Wilmer]] has written, further, that "the anthologizing of short purple passages, removed from their intended contexts" is "something which Ruskin himself detested and which has bedevilled his reputation from the start".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clive Wilmer]] (ed.), ''Unto This Last and Other Writings'' (Penguin, 1985; and Kindle), pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some aspects of Ruskin's theory and criticism require further consideration.

===Art and design criticism===
Ruskin's early work defended the reputation of [[J. M. W. Turner]]. He believed that all great art should communicate an understanding and appreciation of nature. Accordingly, inherited artistic conventions should be rejected. Only by means of direct observation can an artist, through form and colour, represent nature in art. He advised artists in ''[[Modern Painters]]'' I to: "go to Nature in all singleness of heart... rejecting nothing, selecting nothing and scorning nothing."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=3.624}} By the 1850s. Ruskin was celebrating the Pre-Raphaelites whose members, he said, had formed "a new and noble school" of art that would provide a basis for a thoroughgoing reform of the art world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/ruskin-turner-and-pre-raphaelites |title=Ruskin, Turner and The Pre-Raphaelites |website=Tate.org.uk |date=7 January 2000 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Ruskin, art should communicate truth above all things. However, this could not be revealed by mere display of skill, and must be an expression of the artist's whole moral outlook. Ruskin rejected the work of [[James McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] because he considered it to epitomise a reductive mechanisation of art.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Ruskin's strong rejection of [[Classicism|Classical tradition]] in ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'' typifies the inextricable mix of aesthetics and morality in his thought: "Pagan in its origin, proud and unholy in its revival, paralysed in its old age... an architecture invented, as it seems, to make plagiarists of its architects, slaves of its workmen, and sybarites of its inhabitants; an architecture in which intellect is idle, invention impossible, but in which all luxury is gratified and all insolence fortified."&lt;ref&gt;Ruskin, ''The Stones of Venice'', iii, ch. iv, §35;  Cook and Wedderburn 11.227.&lt;/ref&gt; Rejection of mechanisation and standardisation informed Ruskin's theories of architecture, and his emphasis on the importance of the Medieval Gothic style. He praised the Gothic for what he saw as its reverence for nature and natural forms; the free, unfettered expression of artisans constructing and decorating buildings; and for the organic relationship he perceived between worker and guild, worker and community, worker and natural environment, and between worker and God. Attempts in the 19th century, to reproduce Gothic forms (such as pointed arches), attempts which he had helped to inspire, were not enough to make these buildings expressions of what Ruskin saw as true Gothic feeling, faith, and organicism.

For Ruskin, the Gothic style in architecture embodied the same moral truths he sought to promote in the visual arts. It expressed the 'meaning' of architecture—as a combination of the values of strength, solidity and aspiration—all written, as it were, in stone. For Ruskin, creating true Gothic architecture involved the whole community, and expressed the full range of human emotions, from the [[wikt:sublime|sublime]] effects of soaring spires to the comically ridiculous carved [[grotesque]]s and [[gargoyle]]s. Even its crude and "savage" aspects were proof of "the liberty of every workman who struck the stone; a freedom of thought, and rank in scale of being, such as no laws, no charters, no charities can secure."&lt;ref&gt;John Unrau, Ruskin, the Workman and the Savageness of Gothic, in New Approaches to Ruskin, ed [[Robert Hewison]], 1981, pp. 33–50&lt;/ref&gt; [[Classical architecture]], in contrast, expressed a morally vacuous and repressive standardisation. Ruskin associated Classical values with modern developments, in particular with the demoralising consequences of the [[industrial revolution]], resulting in buildings such as the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], which he criticised.&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 12.417–32. Cynthia J. Gamble, "John Ruskin: conflicting responses to Crystal Palace" in Françoise Dassy and Catherine Hajdenko-Marshall (eds.), ''Sociétés et conflit: enjeux et représentation'' (L‟Harmattan et l‟Université de Cergy-Pontoise, 2006), pp. 135–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ruskin wrote about architecture in many works over the course of his career, his much-anthologised essay "The Nature of Gothic" from the second volume of ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'' (1853) is widely considered to be one of his most important and evocative discussions of his central argument.

Ruskin's theories indirectly encouraged a revival of Gothic styles, but Ruskin himself was often dissatisfied with the results. He objected that forms of mass-produced ''faux'' Gothic did not exemplify his principles, but showed disregard for the true meaning of the style. Even the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]], a building designed with Ruskin's collaboration, met with his disapproval. The [[O'Shea and Whelan|O'Shea brothers]], freehand stone carvers chosen to revive the creative "freedom of thought" of Gothic craftsmen, disappointed him by their lack of reverence for the task.

Ruskin's distaste for oppressive standardisation led to later works attacking ''[[Laissez-faire]]'' capitalism which he considered to be at the root of it. His ideas provided inspiration for the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], the founders of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], the [[National Art Collections Fund]], and the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]].

Ruskin's views on art, wrote [[Kenneth Clark]], "cannot be made to form a [[logical system]], and perhaps owe to this fact a part of their value."  Ruskin's accounts of art are descriptions of a superior type that conjure images vividly in the mind's eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Clark neatly summarises the key features of Ruskin's writing on art and architecture:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# Art is not a matter of taste, but involves the whole man. Whether in making or perceiving a work of art, we bring to bear on it feeling, intellect, morals, knowledge, memory, and every other human capacity, all focused in a flash on a single point. Aesthetic man is a concept as false and dehumanising as economic man.
# Even the most superior mind and the most powerful imagination must found itself on facts, which must be recognised for what they are. The imagination will often reshape them in a way which the prosaic mind cannot understand; but this recreation will be based on facts, not on formulas or illusions.
# These facts must be perceived by the senses, or felt; not learnt.
# The greatest artists and schools of art have believed it their duty to impart vital truths, not only about the facts of vision, but about religion and the conduct of life.
# Beauty of form is revealed in organisms which have developed perfectly according to their laws of growth, and so give, in his own words, 'the appearance of felicitous fulfilment of function.'
# This fulfilment of function depends on all parts of an organism cohering and co-operating. This was what he called the 'Law of Help,' one of Ruskin's fundamental beliefs, extending from nature and art to society.
# Good art is done with enjoyment. The artist must feel that, within certain reasonable limits, he is free, that he is wanted by society, and that the ideas he is asked to express are true and important.
# Great art is the expression of epochs where people are united by a common faith and a common purpose, accept their laws, believe in their leaders, and take a serious view of human destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Clark, "A Note on Ruskin's Writings on Art and Architecture," in idem, ''Ruskin Today'' (John Murray, 1964) (reissued as ''Selected Writings'', Penguin, 1991), pp. 133–34.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Historic preservation===
Ruskin's belief in preservation of ancient buildings had a significant influence on later thinking about the distinction between conservation and restoration. Ruskin was a strong proponent of the former, while his contemporary, [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], promoted the latter. In ''[[The Seven Lamps of Architecture]],'' (1849) Ruskin wrote:

{{Quote|text=Neither by the public, nor by those who have the care of public monuments, is the true meaning of the word ''restoration'' understood. It means the most total destruction which a building can suffer: a destruction out of which no remnants can be gathered: a destruction accompanied with false description of the thing destroyed. Do not let us deceive ourselves in this important matter; it is ''impossible'', as impossible as to raise the dead, to restore anything that has ever been great or beautiful in architecture.|source=&lt;small&gt;''Seven Lamps'' ("The Lamp of Memory") c. 6; Cook and Wedderburn 8.242.&lt;/small&gt;}}

This abhorrence of restoration is in marked contrast to Viollet-le-Duc, who wrote that restoration is a "means to reestablish [a building] to a finished state, which may in fact never have actually existed at any given time."&lt;ref&gt;Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc. ([1854] 1990). ''The foundations of architecture''. New York: George Braziller. p. 195. (Translated by Kenneth D. Whitehead from the original French.)&lt;/ref&gt;

For Ruskin, the "age" of a building was crucially significant as an aspect in its preservation: "For, indeed, the greatest glory of a building is not in its stones, not in its gold. Its glory is in its Age, and in that deep sense of voicefulness, of stern watching, of mysterious sympathy, nay, even of approval or condemnation, which we feel in walls that have long been washed by the passing waves of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;''Seven Lamps'' ("The Lamp of Memory") c. 6; Cook and Wedderburn 8.233–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social theory===
Ruskin attacked orthodox, 19th-century [[political economy]] principally on the grounds that it failed to acknowledge complexities of human desires and motivations (broadly, "social affections"). He began to express such ideas in ''The Stones of Venice'', and increasingly in works of the later 1850s, such as ''The Political Economy of Art'' (''A Joy For Ever''), but he gave them full expression in the influential essays, ''Unto This Last''.

{{Quote box |width=380px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right
|quote=Nay, but I choose my physician and my clergyman, thus indicating my sense of the quality of their work. By all means, also, choose your bricklayer; that is the proper reward of the good workman, to be "chosen." The natural and right system respecting all labour is, that it should be paid at a fixed rate, but the good workman employed, and the bad workman unemployed. The false, unnatural, and destructive system is when the bad workman is allowed to offer his work at half-price, and either take the place of the good, or force him by his competition to work for an inadequate sum.|source=&lt;small&gt;Cook and Wedderburn, 17.V.34 (1860).&lt;/small&gt; }}

At the root of his theory, was Ruskin's dissatisfaction with the role and position of the worker, and especially the artisan or craftsman, in modern [[capitalism|industrial capitalist]] society. Ruskin believed that the economic theories of [[Adam Smith]], expressed in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' had led, through the [[division of labour]] to the alienation of the worker not merely from the process of work itself, but from his fellow workmen and other classes, causing increasing resentment. (See section, "Stones of Venice", above.)

He argued that one remedy would be to pay work at a fixed rate of wages, because human need is consistent and a given quantity of work justly demands a certain return. The best workmen would remain in employment because of the quality of their work (a focus on quality growing out of his writings on art and architecture). The best workmen could not, in a fixed-wage economy, be undercut by an inferior worker or product.

In the preface to ''Unto This Last'' (1862), Ruskin recommended that the state should underwrite standards of service and production to guarantee social justice. This included the recommendation of government youth-training schools promoting employment, health, and 'gentleness and justice'; government manufactories and workshops; government schools for the employment at fixed wages of the unemployed, with idlers compelled to toil; and pensions provided for the elderly and the destitute, as a matter of right, received honourably and not in shame.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=17.17–24}} Many of these ideas were later incorporated into the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;Jose Harris, "Ruskin and Social Reform" in Dinah Birch (ed.), ''Ruskin and the Dawn of the Modern'' (Clarendon Press, 1999), pp. 7–33, specifically p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Turner's erotic drawings===
Until 2005, biographies of both [[J. M. W. Turner]] and Ruskin had claimed that in 1858 Ruskin burned bundles of erotic paintings and drawings by Turner to protect Turner's posthumous reputation. Ruskin's friend [[Ralph Nicholson Wornum]], who was Keeper of the [[National Gallery]], was said to have colluded in the alleged destruction of Turner's works. In 2005, these works, which form part of the Turner Bequest held at [[Tate Britain]], were re-appraised by Turner Curator Ian Warrell, who concluded that Ruskin and Wornum had not destroyed them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1381143,00.html ''The Guardian'' report on the discovery of Turner's drawings.] Also see Warrell "Exploring the 'Dark Side': Ruskin and the Problem of Turner's Erotica", ''British Art Journal'', vol. IV, no. 1, Spring 2003, pp. 15–46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lyall |first=Sarah |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E4DB1738F930A25752C0A9639C8B63 |title=A Censorship Story Goes Up in Smoke – No Bonfire Devoured J.M.W. Turner's Erotica  |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 January 2005 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexuality===
Ruskin's sexuality has led to much speculation and critical comment. His one marriage, to [[Effie Gray]], was annulled after six years because of non-consummation. Effie, in a letter to her parents, claimed that he found her "person" repugnant.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He alleged various reasons, hatred of children, religious motives, a desire to preserve my beauty, and finally this last year he told me his true reason... that he had imagined women were quite different to what he saw I was, and that the reason he did not make me his Wife was because he was disgusted with my person the first evening 10th April [1848].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ruskin confirmed this in his statement to his lawyer during the annulment proceedings.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It may be thought strange that I could abstain from a woman who to most people was so attractive. But though her face was beautiful, her person was not formed to excite passion. On the contrary, there were certain circumstances in her person which completely checked it.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lutyens, ''Millais and the Ruskins'', p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The cause of Ruskin's "disgust" has led to much speculation. Ruskin's biographer, [[Mary Lutyens]], suggested that he rejected Effie because he was horrified by the sight of her pubic hair. Lutyens argued that Ruskin must have known the female form only through Greek statues and paintings of the nude lacking pubic hair and found the reality shocking.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens, M., ''Millais and the Ruskins'', p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Peter Fuller]] in his book ''Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace'' writes, "It has been said that he was frightened on the wedding night by the sight of his wife's pubic hair; more probably, he was perturbed by her menstrual blood."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fuller, ''Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace'', Chatto &amp; Windus, 1988, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's biographers Tim Hilton and John Batchelor also take the view that menstruation is the more likely explanation, though Batchelor also suggests that body-odour may have been the problem. Debate cannot currently resolve this issue; [[William Ewart Gladstone]] said to his daughter, Mary, "should you ever hear anyone blame Millais or his wife, or Mr. Ruskin, remember that there is no fault; there was misfortune, even tragedy. All three were perfectly blameless.".&lt;ref&gt;Q. in J. Howard Whitehouse, Vindication of Ruskin (George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd, 1950), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin's later relationship with [[Rose La Touche]] has led to claims that he was a [[paedophile]], on the grounds that he stated that he fell in love with her when he met her at the age of nine.&lt;ref&gt;Current evidence suggests that she was ten when they met, but Ruskin states in his autobiography that she was only nine. Hewison, R, John Ruskin, ''The Argument of the Eye'', p.160; [http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/biography/0,6121,132930,00.html#article_continue The Guardian, review of Batchelor, J., John Ruskin: ''No Wealth but Life'', 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he did not approach her as a suitor until on or near her eighteenth birthday. She asked him to wait for her until she was 21. Receiving no answer, he repeated his proposal. Ruskin is not known to have had any sexually intimate relationships. During an episode of mental derangement after Rose died, he wrote a letter in which he insisted that Rose's spirit had instructed him to marry a girl who was visiting him at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, T. ''John Ruskin: The Later Years'', p. 553, "absolutely under her [Rose's] orders I have asked Tenny Watson to marry me and come abroad with her father."&lt;/ref&gt; It is also true that in letters from Ruskin to [[Kate Greenaway]] he asked her to draw her "girlies" (as he called her child figures) without clothing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Will you – (it's all for your own good – !) make her stand up and then draw her for me without a cap – and, without her shoes, – (because of the heels) and without her mittens, and without her – frock and frills?  And let me see exactly how tall she is – and – how – round. It will be so good of and for you – And to and for me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lurie |first=Alison |authorlink=Alison Lurie |title=Don't Tell the Grown-Ups: The Subversive Power of Children's Literature |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3WROewAACAAJ |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company|Little, Brown]] |date=20 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a letter to his physician John Simon on 15 May 1886, Ruskin wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I like my girls from ten to sixteen—allowing of 17 or 18 as long as they're not in love with anybody but me.—I've got some darlings of 8—12—14—just now, and my Pigwiggina here—12—who fetches my wood and is learning to play my bells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3362/is_4_86/ai_n31641126/ ]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Philological Quarterly'', Fall, 2007 by Van Akin Burd&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pigwiggina is a nickname Ruskin used for the girl as she looked after (lambs and) piglets; c.f. {{cite book |title=Letters to M. G. and H. G. |url=https://archive.org/stream/letterstomgandhg00rusk/letterstomgandhg00rusk_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ruskin's biographers disagree about the allegation of "paedophilia". Tim Hilton, in his two-volume biography, boldly asserts that Ruskin "was a paedophile" but leaves the claim unexplained, while John Batchelor argues that the term is inappropriate because Ruskin's behaviour does not "fit the profile".&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, T., ''John Ruskin: A Life'', vol. 1, pp. 253–54; Batchelor, J, ''John Ruskin: No Wealth but Life'', p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Abse concluded that "the older girls became, the more their attractions diminished in his eyes. He liked them best, as he was to tell his friend Lady Naesmith two years later, when they were 'just in the very rose of dawn'".&lt;ref&gt;Joan Abse, ''John Ruskin – The Passionate Moralist'', Quarter Books, London, 1980, pp. 177–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Others also point to a definite pattern of "[[Nympholepsy|nympholeptic]]" behaviour with regard to his interactions with girls at a [[Winnington Hall|Winnington school]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Kemp and Jan Van Heurck, ''The Desire of My Eyes: The Life &amp; Work of John Ruskin '', p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no evidence that Ruskin ever engaged in any sexual activity with anyone. According to one interpretation, what Ruskin valued most in pre-pubescent girls was (supposedly in common with his contemporary, [[Lewis Carroll]]) their innocence; the fact that they were not (yet) fully developed sexual beings is what attracted him.&lt;ref&gt;''John Ruskin. The Last Visionary'', tx. 13 March 2000 (BBC1).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common law of business balance===
Ruskin is frequently identified as the originator of the "[[common law of business balance]]"—a statement about the relationships of price and quality as they pertain to manufactured goods, and often summarised as:  "The common law of business balance prohibits paying a little and getting a lot." This is the core of a longer statement usually attributed to Ruskin, although Ruskin's authorship is disputed among Ruskin scholars. Shapiro maintains that the statement does not appear anywhere in Ruskin's works,&lt;ref name="Shapiro"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Fred R. Shapiro]] |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ck6bXqt5shkC&amp;pg=PA657 |title=The Yale Book of Quotations|year=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=657 |isbn=9780300107982 |accessdate = 7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Landow is likewise sceptical of the claim of Ruskin's authorship.&lt;ref name=Landow2007&gt;{{cite web |last=Landow |first=George P. |title=A Ruskin Quotation? |publisher=VictorianWeb.org |date=27 July 2007 |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/quotation.html |accessdate=7 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a posting of the ''Ruskin Library News'', a blog associated with the [[Ruskin Library]] (a major collection of Ruskiniana located at [[Lancaster University]]), an anonymous library staff member briefly mentions the statement and its widespread use, saying that, "This is one of many quotations ascribed to Ruskin, without there being any trace of them in his writings – although someone, somewhere, thought they sounded like Ruskin."&lt;ref name="Ruskin Library"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ruskinlibrary.wordpress.com/2010/10/21/on-the-present-economic-situation/|title=On the present economic situation:|last=Ruskin Library|publisher=Ruskin Library|date=23 May 2011|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruskin Library"/&gt; The signs listed Ruskin as the author of the statement, but the signs gave no information on where or when Ruskin was supposed to have written, spoken, or published the statement. Due to the statement's widespread use as a promotional slogan, and despite questions of Ruskin's authorship, it is likely that many people who are otherwise unfamiliar with Ruskin now associate him with this statement.

==Definitions==
[[File:John Ruskin 1850s 2.jpg|thumb|upright|John Ruskin in the 1850s, photo from the [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]].]]
* [[Pathetic fallacy]]: Ruskin coined this term in ''Modern Painters'' III (1856) to describe the ascription of human emotions to inanimate objects and impersonal natural forces, as in "Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy" (Charlotte Brontë, ''Jane Eyre'').&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Painter''s III (see Part VI, "Of Many Things", c. XII, "Of the Paethetic Fallacy") see ''Works'' 5.201–220.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fors Clavigera]]: Ruskin gave this title to a series of letters he wrote "to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain" (1871–84). The name was intended to signify three great powers which go to fashion human destiny, as Ruskin explained at length in Letter 2 (February 1871). These were: ''Force'', symbolised by the club (''clava'') of [[Hercules]]; ''For''titude, symbolised by the key (''clavis'') of Ulysses; and ''For''tune, symbolised by the nail (''clavus'') of [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]]. These three powers (the "fors") together represent human talents and abilities to choose the right moment and then to strike with energy. The concept is derived from [[Shakespeare]]'s phrase "There is a tide in the affairs of men/ Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune" (Brutus in ''Julius Caesar''). Ruskin believed that the letters were inspired by the Third Fors: striking out at the right moment.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Works'' 27.27–44 and 28.106–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a full and concise introduction to the work, see Dinah Birch, "Introduction", in John Ruskin, ''Fors Clavigera'', ed. Dinah Birch (Edinburgh University Press, 2000), pp. xxxiii–xlix.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Theoria: Ruskin's 'theoretic' faculty – theoretic, as opposed to aesthetic – enables a vision of the beautiful as intimating a reality deeper than the everyday, at least in terms of the kind of transcendence generally seen as immanent in things of this world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortnightlyreview.co.uk/2011/04/ruskin-crown/ |title=The Fortnightly Review › Ruskin and the distinction between Aesthesis and Theoria |website=Fortnightlyreview.co.uk |date=7 April 2009 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an example of the influence of Ruskin's concept of theoria, see [[Peter Fuller]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fuller, ''Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace'' (Chatto and Windus, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Modern Atheism: Ruskin applied this label to ''the unfortunate persistence of the clergy in teaching children what they cannot understand, and in employing young consecrate persons to assert in pulpits what they do not know.''
* [[Illth]]: Used by Ruskin as the antithesis of wealth, which he defined as life itself; broadly, where wealth is 'well-being', illth is "ill-being".
* Excrescence: Ruskin defined an "excrescence" as an outgrowth of the main body of a building that does not harmonise well with the main body. He originally used the term to describe certain [[gothic revival]] features&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Seven Lamps of Architecture|author = Ruskin, John|publisher = Dover Publications|year = 1989|page = 210}}&lt;/ref&gt; also for later additions to cathedrals and various other public buildings, especially from the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Seven Lamps of Architecture|author = Ruskin, John|publisher = Dover Publications|year = 1989|page = 396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''list of guitar tunings''' supplements the article [[guitar tunings]]. In particular, this list contains more examples of open and regular tunings, which are discussed in the article on guitar tunings. In addition, this list also notes dropped tunings.

==Open==
{{Main article|Open tuning}}

===Major===
[[File:First eight harmonics vertical.png|thumb|Initial eight harmonics on C, namely (C,C,G,C,E,G,B{{music|flat}},C) {{audio|First eight harmonics vertical.mid|Play simultaneously}}]]

Major open-tunings give a [[major chord]] with the open strings.

====Open A====
: E-A-C{{music|sharp}}-E-A-E
* Alternatively: E-A-C{{music|sharp}}-E-A-C{{music|sharp}}
* Alternatively: A-E-A-E-A-C{{music|sharp}} (one step down from "Open B")
* '''[[Slide guitar|"Slide"]]''' Open A: E-A-E-A-C{{music|sharp}}-E (identical to "Open G" tuning but with every string raised one step or two frets) Used by [[Jimmy Page]] on "[[In My Time of Dying]]"" and [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]] on "[[Seven Nation Army]]"

====Open B====
: B-F{{music|sharp}}-B-F{{music|sharp}}-B-E{{music|flat}}
* Alternatively: F{{music|sharp}}-B-E{{music|flat}}-F{{music|sharp}}-B-E{{music|flat}}
Used by [[Nickelback]] on "Should've Listened", [[Devin Townsend]] in recent years, and [[Big Wreck]] on "[[Albatross (Big Wreck song)|Albatross]]".

====Open C====
: [[Open C tuning#C-G-C-G-C-E|C-G-C-G-C-E]]

This open&amp;nbsp;C tuning is used by [[William&amp;nbsp;Ackerman]] for his "Townsend&amp;nbsp;Shuffle" and by [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]] for [[The Great Santa Barbara Oil Slick#Track listing|his tribute]] to [[Mississippi&amp;nbsp;John&amp;nbsp;Hurt]]. This tuning is also commonly used by John Butler on his 12 string guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sethares|2009|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tuning is used on most work by [[Devin Townsend]] in his solo work as well as his work with [[Strapping Young Lad]]. When playing on a 7 string guitar, he would have a low G as the lowest string to complete the fifth.

: [[Open C tuning#Repetitive C-E-G-C-E-G|C-E-G-C-E-G]]
The [[English guitar]] used a [[repetitive tuning|repetitive]] open-C tuning that approximated a [[major-thirds tuning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Guitar and Lute Composers|authors=Hannu Annala, Heiki Mätlik|edition=Translated by Katarina Backman|publisher=Mel Bay|year=2007|id={{ISBN|0786658444}} |isbn=9780786658442 |page=30|ref=harv|chapter=Composers for other plucked instruments: Rudolf Straube (1717-1785)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The source says "C major thirds tuning", which seems to be a mistranslation of work by Finnish-named authors, I believe, or it could be an approximation of the truth. There is not C major thirds tuning, but the one I give is the closest.--&gt;

:[[Open C tuning#Overtones C-C-G-C-E-G|C-C-G-C-E-G]]&lt;ref name="Guitar Tunings Database 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=CCGCEG Guitar Tuner|work=CCGCEG: Open&amp;nbsp;C via harmonic overtones|id=|ref=harv|accessdate=20 February 2013|author=Guitar Tunings Database|url=http://www.gtdb.org/tuner/ccgceg/|year=2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310120037/http://www.gtdb.org/tuner/ccgceg/|archivedate=10 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This open-C tuning gives the initial [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] when a C-string is struck.&lt;ref name="Persichetti 1961 23–24"&gt;{{harvtxt|Persichetti|1961|pp=23–24}}: {{cite book |last=Persichetti |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Persichetti|title=Twentieth-century harmony: Creative aspects and practice |year=1961 |publisher=W. W. Norton |location=New York |isbn=0-393-09539-8 |oclc=398434|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The C-C-G-C-E-G tuning uses the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic sequence]] (overtones) of the note C. When an open-note C-string is struck, its [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic sequence]] begins with the notes (C,C,G,C,E,G,B♭,C).&lt;ref name="Guitar Tunings Database 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Persichetti 1961 23–24"/&gt;
This overtone-series tuning was modified by [[Mick Ralphs]], who used a high C rather than the high G for "[[Can't Get Enough (Bad Company song)|Can't Get Enough]]" on ''[[Bad Company (album)|Bad Company]]''. Ralphs said, "It needs the open C to have that ring," and "it never really sounds right in standard tuning".&lt;ref name="Ralphs"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mick Ralphs: The rock 'N' roll fantasy continues|first=Lisa|last=Sharken|date=15 May 2001|accessdate=21 February 2013|ref=harv|url=http://www.vintageguitar.com/2801/mick-ralphs/|journal=Vintage Guitar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Open D====
[[File:Open D tuning.png|thumb|right|Open D tuning.]]
[[File:Guitar Open-D Tuning.ogg|noicon|right|thumb|Open D tuning (listen)]]

: D-A-D-F{{music|sharp}}-A-D

Open-D tuning is used by [[Joni Mitchell]] for her "[[Big Yellow Taxi]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sethares|2009|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nick Drake]] for "Place To Be", [[Alt-J]] for "Interlude 2", and by [[Soko (singer)|Soko]] for "No More Home, No More Love".
Open-D tuning has been called ''Vestapol'' tuning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Grossman|1972|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richie Havens]] used Open D tuning to be able to play chords using only his thumb and one or two fingers.

* Alternatively: D-A-D'-A'-D''-D''
This alternative Open D tuning (and its downtuned variations) is frequently used by [[Mark Tremonti]] guitarist for the bands [[Creed (band)|Creed]], [[Alter Bridge]], and Tremonti. It was also used by [[Keith Richards]] on "[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]" and the [[Stone Roses]] in "[[Love Spreads]]".{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

: C{{music|sharp}}-G{{music|sharp}}-C{{music|sharp}}-F-G{{music|sharp}}-C{{music|sharp}}

Same as Open-D but tuned a half-step down. Used by [[Alice In Chains]] on the songs "[[Over Now]]", "[[Nothin' Song]]", and "Shame in You".

====Open E====
: E-B-E-G#-B-E (''use light gauge strings'' because three strings must be raised) Open E is used by: [[Brian Jones]] on "[[No Expectations]]", "[[I Wanna Be Your Man]]"; [[Keith Richards]] on "[[Salt of the Earth (song)|Salt of the Earth]]", "[[Prodigal Son]]", "[[Gimme Shelter]]", "[[Jigsaw Puzzle]]", "[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]", "[[You Can't Always Get What You Want]]" and by Bob Dylan on his 1975 album ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]''.  By [[Hoobastank]] on their first and second albums, and by [[Junior Campbell]] on [[The Marmalade]] recordings [[Reflections of My Life]] and [[I See The Rain]] Used by Johnny Marr of the Smiths on "[[The Headmaster Ritual]]".

====Open F====
: F-A-C-F-C-F (requires light gauge strings)

*Alternatively (without light gauge strings): C-F-C-F-A-C
C-F-C-F-A-C is the more common of the two.
Used by
:Elizabeth Cotten on her song "When I Get Home"
:Led Zeppelin on "When the Levee Breaks" and "Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp" (studio)
* '''F-Sharp Tuning''': F{{music|sharp}}-B{{music|flat}}-C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}}-C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}}
* '''Alternative''': C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}}-C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}}-A{{music|flat}}-C{{music|sharp}}
F-F-C-F-A-C is also used by Dave Mason on "Only You Know and I Know"

===Minor: Cross-note===
The following open-tunings use a minor third, and give a ''[[minor chord]]'' with open strings. To avoid the relatively cumbersome designation "open D minor", "open C minor", such tunings are sometimes called ''"cross-note tunings"''. The term also expresses the fact that, compared to Major chord open tunings, by fretting the lowered string at the first fret, it is possible to produce a major chord very easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sethares|2001|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross-note or open E-minor was used by [[Bukka White]] and [[Skip James]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Andy|date=22 March 2005|title=Stefan Grossman- Country Blues Guitar in Open Tunings|journal=[[Sing Out!]]|volume=49|issue=1|pages=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross-note tunings include (low to high):
* '''Cross-note A''': E-A-E-A-C-E

===Modal===
[[File:D modal tuning.png|thumb|right|D modal tuning.]]

In modal tunings, the strings are tuned to form a chord which is not definitively minor or major. These tunings may facilitate very easy chords and unique sounds when the open strings are used as drones. Often these tunings form a [[suspended chord]] on the open strings. A well known user of modal tunings is [[Sonic Youth]].

The triangle is circumscribed by the chromatic circle, which lists the 12 notes of the octave.|For every major-thirds tuning, the consecutive [[open string (music)|open]]-[[open note|note]]s are separated by four [[semitone]]s, and so three strings cover the twelve notes of the octave.]]
{{Main article|Regular tuning}}

===Major seconds===
:C-D-E-F{{music|#}}-G{{music|#}}-A{{music|#}} or C{{music|#}}-D{{music|#}}-F-G-A-B

A compact tuning that fits within one octave and covers the chromatic scale between open strings and the first fret.

===Minor thirds===
:C-D{{music|#}}-F{{music|#}}-A-C-D{{music|#}}

In the minor-thirds tuning, every interval between successive strings is a [[minor third]]. In the minor-thirds tuning beginning with C, the open strings contain the notes (C, D{{music|#}}, F{{music|#}}) of the [[diminished triad|diminished C]] chord.&lt;ref name="Sethares54"&gt;{{harvtxt|Sethares|2001|pp=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the all-fifths and all-fourths tunings are ''[[tritone|augmented-fourth]]'' tunings, which are also called "''diminished-fifths''" or "''tritone''" tunings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt |Sethares |2001 |loc="The augmented fourths tuning" 60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|All fifths tuning}}
:C-G-D-A-E'-B' or G'-D-A-E'-B-F{{music|#}}'

All-fifths tuning is a tuning in intervals of [[perfect fifth]]s like that of a [[mandolin]], [[cello]] or violin; other names include "perfect fifths" and "fifths".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt |Sethares |2001 |loc="The mandoguitar tuning" 62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a wide range, thus it requires an appropriate range of string gauges. A high ''b''' string is particularly thin and taut, which can be avoided by shifting the scale down by several steps or by a fifth.

====New standard tuning====
{{main article|New Standard Tuning}}
{{see also|Guitar Craft}}
:C-G-D-A-E'-g'

All-fifths tuning has been approximated by the [[New Standard Tuning]] (NST) of [[King Crimson]]'s [[Robert Fripp]]. It has a wider range than standard tuning, and its perfect-fifth intervals facilitate [[quartal and quintal harmony]].

===Ostrich tuning===
:E-E-e-e-e'-e' or C-C-c-c-c'-c'

''[[Ostrich guitar|Ostrich tuning]]'' is a tuning where all strings are tuned to the same note over two or three octaves,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0715563/bio Lou Reed biography] at [[IMDB]]&lt;/ref&gt; creating an intense, [[Chorus effect|chorused]] [[drone (music)|drone]] and interesting fingering potential.

Used by [[Soundgarden]] (E-E-e-e-e'-e') on the song "Mind Riot", and by Lou Reed in the Velvet Underground.

==Dropped==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
[[File:Drop D tuning.png|thumb|right|Drop D tuning.]]

''Drop tunings'' lower the sixth string, dropping the lowest E string of the standard tuning. Some drop tunings also lower the fifth string (A note in standard tuning). A ''drop&amp;nbsp;one'' tuning lowers the pitch by one full step.

Some of these may require a [[baritone guitar]] due to the string tension required for extremely low notes. Others can be achieved using a [[capo]] and/or a [[partial capo]].

===Examples===

==Shifted==
These tunings are derived by systematic increases or decreases to standard tuning.

===Lowered===
[[File:D tuning.png|thumb|right|D tuning.]]

Derived from standard EADGBE, all the strings are tuned lower by the same interval, thus providing the same chord positions transposed to a lower key. Lower tunings are popular among rock and heavy metal bands. The reason for tuning down below standard pitch is usually either to accommodate a singer's vocal range or to get a deeper/heavier sound.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.betterguitar.com/instruction/rhythm_guitar/tune_down_half_step/tune_down_half_step.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Terz tuning for guitar.png|thumb|right|[[Terz guitar|Terz tuning]].]]

From standard EADGBE, all the strings are tuned up by the same interval. String tension will be higher. Typically requires thinner gauge strings, particularly the first string which could be as thin as six thousandths of an inch (about the thickness of a single human hair). A [[capo]] is typically preferred over these tunings, as they do not increase neck strain, etc. The advantage of these tunings is that they allow an extended upper note range versus a capo used with standard tuning which limits the number of notes that can be played; in some cases, instruo B{{music|flat}} or E{{music|flat}} (such as [[saxophone]]s, which were frequently encountered in early rock and roll music) are more easily played when the accompanying guitar plays chords in the higher tuning. If standard gauge strings are used, the result is often a "brighter" or "tighter" sound; this was a common practice for some bluegrass bands in the 1950s, notably Flatt &amp; Scruggs.

*'''F tuning''' - F-A{{music|sharp}}-D{{music|sharp}}-G{{music|sharp}}-C-F / F-B{{music|flat}}-E{{music|flat}}-A{{music|flat}}-C-F&lt;br /&gt;Half a step up from standard tuning. Used in most of [[Johnny Cash]]'s music, for "Love Buzz" on Nirvana's ''Bleach'' album - apparently by mistake (according to Come As You Are - Michael Azerrad), [[3 Doors Down]] on "[[Here Without You]]" (a capo was probably used), [[Vektor (band)|Vektor]], [[Soundgarden]]'s "[[Black Hole Sun]]" (The low E string was tuned to Eb/D# for a drop Eb/D# tuning), [[Nickelback]] on their song "[[When We Stand Together]]", [[Burzum]] on his first 3 albums, John Fedowitz in his solo project "Ceremony", and [[Joe Jackson (musician)|Joe Jackson]] on "[[Got the Time]]".
*'''F{{music|sharp}}/G{{music|flat}} tuning''' - F{{music|sharp}}-B-E-A-C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}} / G{{music|flat}}-B-E-A-D{{music|flat}}-G{{music|flat}}&lt;br /&gt;One full step up from standard. Primary tuning for the band [[The Chameleons]]. [[Johnny Marr]] also used this tuning extensively with [[The Smiths]]; bassist [[Andy Rourke]] remained in standard, however, even when Marr was playing in F#. British singer-songwriter [[Dave Mason]] also plays in F#.

===Dad-Gad===
{{main article|DADGAD}}
[[File:Guitar DADGAD Tuning.ogg|noicon|right|thumb|DADGAD tuning (listen)]]
:D-A-d-g-a-d'
DADGAD was developed by Davey Graham in the early 1960s when he was travelling in Morocco, to more easily play along with Oud music  Among the first to use this tuning were the folk-blues guitarists of the 60s like Bert Jansch, John Rebourn, Martin Carthy, and John Martyn. It was many years later in the 1970s that it became established for accompanists of traditional music, predominantly Scottish and Irish. Due to this popularity it is sometimes referred to as "Celtic" tuning, although this is misleading given its origin and it's primary early use in a quite different field of music. Often vocalized as "Dad-Gad", [[DADGAD]] it is now common in [[Celtic music]]. In rock music, has been used in [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]".&lt;ref name="Gordie"/&gt; [[Pierre Bensusan]] is another noted exponent of this tuning. The [[post-metal]] group [[Russian Circles]] also employ this tuning, and also plays it in the form of all the notes becoming a half-step down: D{{music|flat}}-A{{music|flat}}-d{{music|flat}}-g{{music|flat}}-a{{music|flat}}-d{{music|flat}}'. Three down-tuned variations are used by the band [[Sevendust]]: A Drop C variation, or C-G-c-f-g-c'. (used on the song "[[Unraveling (song)|Unraveling]]"), a Drop B variation, or B'-F{{music|sharp}}-B-e-f{{music|sharp}}-b, and a Drop A# variation, or A{{music|sharp}}'-F-A{{music|sharp}}-d{{music|sharp}}-f-a{{music|sharp}}. Neighboring tunings D-A-d-e-a-e' and C-G-c-d-g-a have been used by [[Martin Carthy]]. Also D-A-d-a-a-d', was used by [[Dave Wakeling]] on the [[English Beat]]'s 1983 "[[Save It For Later]]".

===Dad-Dad===
[[File:Guitar DADDAD Tuning.ogg|noicon|right|thumb|DADDAD tuning (listen)]]
:D-A-d-d-a-d'
Nicknamed - "Papa-Papa". DADDAD is common in folk music (Irish, Scottish), and for the execution of a rhythm guitar in "heavy" (alternative music) on 6th on the third string at the same time. To reach the tuning from DADGAD, Open D or Open D Minor, the G string is dropped to D so that the 3rd and 4th strings are tuned to the same pitch. DADDAD tuning is sometimes used on Dobro guitars for rock and blues. Notable users of this tuning include [[Billy McLaughlin]] and [[John Butler (musician)|John Butler]].

===Cello/Standard guitar===
:C-G-d-a-b-e'
Essentially a cello tuning with the deeper four strings in fifths and the two highest strings in standard guitar tuning. Used on numerous [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] songs and by [[Foo Fighters]] on the song "[[Foo Fighters (album)|Weenie Beenie]]"

==="Karnivool" tuning===
:B-F{{music|sharp}}-b-g-b-e'
Hybrid tuning between drop B-tuning and E-standard. Used by the band [[Karnivool]] for many of their songs.

===Mi-composé===
:E-A-d'-g-b-e'
[[Mi-composé]] is a tuning commonly used for rhythm guitar in [[African popular music]] forms such as [[soukous]] and [[makossa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steward|first=Gary|title=Rumba on the River: A History of the Popular Music of the Two Congos|year=2004|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-85984-368-0|pages=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gKEHO1z413EC&amp;pg=PA34}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to the standard guitar tuning, except that the d string is raised an entire octave.  This is accomplished by replacing the d string with an e' string and tuning it to d'.

==="Iris" Tuning===
:B-D-D-D-d-d
Tuning used by [[Johnny Rzeznik]] of the [[Goo Goo Dolls]] on the song [[Iris (Goo Goo Dolls song)|"Iris"]].

===E-A-C#-F#-A-C# ("Sleeping Ute")===
:E-A-C#-F#-A-C#
Tuning used by [[Grizzly Bear (band)|Grizzly Bear]] guitarist [[Daniel Rossen]] in "[[Sleeping Ute (song)|Sleeping Ute]]", the opening song of their album ''[[Shields (album)|Shields]]''. Creates an F#m7/E chord when strummed open.

===FGC3===
{{main article|FGC3}}
:F-G-C-E-G#-C
This is a guitar tuning and style of playing on the Classical Guitar that has been developed by Ian Low. It was recently publicized in the form of a series of videos posted onto his [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfWGk6aJrA4&amp;feature=youtu.be YouTube channel] on 14 July 2016. The 6 strings are tuned to F, G, C, E, C# and C using the standard guitar strings EADGBE strings to allow a different style of harmonic playing.

===Microtonal tuning===
{{See also|Microtonal music}}
The open strings of a guitar can be tuned to microtonal intervals, however microtonal scales cannot easily be played on a conventional guitar because the frets only allow for a chromatic scale of twelve equally spaced pitches, each a semitone apart. (Certain microtonal scales, particularly [[quarter tone]]s, can be played on a standard guitar solely by adjusting tunings, but the distance between notes on the scale makes it somewhat impractical.) It is possible to play microtonal scales on a [[fretless guitar]], to convert a fretted guitar into a fretless, or to make a custom neck with a specific microtonal fret spacing.

Guitars can also be refretted to a microtonal scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

To enable an adjustable microtonal tuning, there exist guitars with frets that can be moved across the fingerboard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.nl/patents/US4981064 US Patent for individually adjustable frets]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erhanbirol.com/othersites/tolgahan/EN/microtonal_en.html The Adjustable Microtonal Guitar by Tolgahan Çoğulu]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extended techniques such as the [[3rd bridge]] technique, slide guitar and [[prepared guitar]] techniques can be used to produce microtonality without severe modification to the instrument.

=== Guitar tunings inspired by other Instruments ===
In his on-line guide to alternative tunings for six-string guitars, [[William Sethares]] mentions several that are inspired by instruments other than guitars, for example, [[balalaika]] (E-A-D-E-E-A), [[cittern]] C-G-C-G-C-G, and [[Dobro]] G-B-D-G-B-D.

===Five-string===
Five string guitars are common in Brazil, where they are known as [[guitarra baiana]] and are typically tuned in 5ths. Schecter Guitar Research produced a production model 5 string guitar called the Celloblaster in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Schecter Guitar Research (1999) ''Diamond Series.'' Schecter Guitar Research Catalogs. Los Angeles, CA&lt;/ref&gt; A five-string tuning may be necessary in a pinch when a string breaks on a standard six-string (usually the high E) and no replacement is immediately available.

Some basic five-string tunings include:
*'''Standard''' - E-A-d-g-b&lt;br/&gt;The standard tuning, without the top E string attached. Alternative variants are easy from this tuning, but because several chords inherently omit the lowest string, it may leave some chords relatively thin or incomplete with the top string missing (the D chord, for instance, must be fretted 5-4-3-2-3 to include F#, the tone a major third above D).
*'''High C''' - E-A-d-g-c'&lt;br/&gt;Standard tuning with the B tuned a half step higher to C to emulate a 6 string bass guitar, minus the low B. This is an [[all fourths tuning]].
*'''Celloblaster''' or '''Guitello''' - C-G-d-a-e'&lt;br/&gt;An [[all fifths tuning]] as used on [[cello]] or [[mandolin]], extended to five strings. Used by the noise-rock band [[Lightning Bolt (band)|Lightning Bolt]], and by Jeffrey McFarland-Johnson on his ''Bach Cello Suites'' album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://johnsong.com/johnsong/music/guitello |first=Jeffrey |last=McFarland-Johnson |work=johnsong.com |title=GUITELLO |year=2013 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Baritone''' - E-A-d-f{{music|sharp}}&lt;!--F# is used due to it being more common than Gb, particularly in chords--&gt;-b&lt;br/&gt;In this tuning, the fourth (G) string is lowered a half-step, thus recreating the intervals between the ''top'' five strings, lowered a perfect fourth. Though chords can easily and more fully be played from this tuning, it sometimes results in awkward [[Inverted chord|inversions]], a relatively minor problem if the five-string is played in an ensemble with a bass guitar.
* E-A-c{{music|sharp}}-f{{music|sharp}}-b&lt;br/&gt;Simulates the top four strings, followed by the second-from-bottom string on top, raised a whole step (the F{{music|sharp}} representing both the top and bottom E). It makes playing in the key of A major easier, though chord fingerings have to be altered unless the strings are rearranged to F{{music|sharp}}-B-E-A-C{{music|sharp}}.
*'''Open G tuning''' - G-d-g-b-d'&lt;br/&gt;Some slide/bottleneck guitarists omit the bottom E string when playing in open G to have the root note as the tonic. This tuning is used by [[Keith Richards]].
*'''Open E{{music|b}}5 tuning''' - E{{music|b}}-B{{music|b}}-e{{music|b}}-b{{music|b}}-e{{music|b}}'&lt;br/&gt;This is achieved by removing the fourth (G) string, tuning both Es and the B down a half step, and the A and D strings up a half-step. This creates a five-string [[power chord]].

===Seven-string===
Similar to five-string bass guitar tuning, seven-string tuning allows for the extra string a fourth lower than the original sixth string. This allows for the note range of B standard tuning without transposing E standard guitar chords down two and a half steps down. Baritone 7-string guitars are available which features a longer scale-length allowing it to be tuned to a lower range.
*'''Standard Tuning''' - B'-E-A-d-g-b-e'&lt;br/&gt;This is the Standard seven-string tuning.
* '''Drop A 7-String Tuning''' - A'-E-A-d-g-b-e'&lt;br/&gt;This is the Standard seven-string tuning with low B dropped to A.
*'''Standard Choro Tuning''' - C-E-A-d-g-b-e'&lt;br /&gt;Standard seven-string tuning for Brazilian [[choro]].
*'''Drop D 7-String Tuning''' - B'-D-A-d-g-b-e'&lt;br /&gt;Standard seven-string tuning with the low E dropped to D, which results in a minor 3rd interval between the two lowest strings of B and D. Used by Ed Sloan of [[Crossfade (band)|Crossfade]]. Also used by [[Animals as Leaders]] on the song "CAFO". A flat variation of this tuning is used by [[Periphery(band)|Periphery]] on the song “Racecar”.
*'''Drop D &amp; A 7-String Tuning''' - A'-D-A-d-g-b-e'&lt;br /&gt;Standard seven-string tuning with a Dropped D and A from E and B. Used extensively by [[Dir En Grey]] since the album "[[Dum Spiro Spero (album)|Dum Spiro Spero]]" as well as the song "Obscure" from the album ''Vulgar''. Also used by [[Stam1na]].
*'''Thirds Tuning''' - E-G{{music|sharp}}-c-e-g{{music|sharp}}-c'-e'&lt;br /&gt;Same range as standard six-string. Allows over two full chromatic octaves without changing position, slides or bends.
*'''All Fourths Tuning''' - B'-E-A-d-g-c'-f'&lt;br /&gt;Expands the major third between the second and third strings, extending range a half step higher.
*'''Russian Tuning''' - D-G-B-D-g-b-d&lt;br/&gt;6-string Open G tuning with additional 5th B-string. Was a standard tuning for classic 7-string guitars in Russia in the 19th to 20th centuries.

*'''F{{music|sharp}}/G{{music|flat}} tuning''' - F{{music|sharp}}'-B'-E-A-d-f{{music|sharp}}-b / G{{music|flat}}'-B'-E-A-d-g{{music|flat}}-b&lt;br /&gt;Two and one half steps down from standard. Used by Danish band [[Mnemic]] in the albums [[Passenger (Mnemic album)|Passenger]], [[Sons of the System]], and [[Mnemesis]]. [[Fear Factory]] also used this tuning for their cover of [[Wiseblood (band)|Wiseblood]]'s "0-0 (Where Evil Dwells)", while their all other songs tuned in F{{music|sharp}}/G{{music|flat}} were played with eight-string guitars.
*'''F tuning''' - F'-A{{music|sharp}}'-D{{music|sharp}}-G{{music|sharp}}-c{{music|sharp}}-f-a{{music|sharp}} / F'-B{{music|flat}}'-E{{music|flat}}-A{{music|flat}}-d{{music|flat}}-f-b{{music|flat}}&lt;br /&gt;Three full steps down from standard.

*'''Octave Tuning''' - B"-E'-A'-D-G-B-e&lt;br /&gt;Six full steps (one octave) down from standard tuning.

The open C tuning for 7-string guitar was [[Devin Townsend|Devin Townsend's]] preferred tuning for the extreme metal band [[Strapping Young Lad]] (GCGCGCE).

====Higher====
*'''High A''' - E-A-d-g-b-e'-a' - Standard tuning with a high 'A' instead of a low 'B'. Because of the high pitch of the 'A' string, it usually requires a [[Fret#Variations|multi-scale fingerboard (fanned frets)]] to provide enough tension.
*'''C tuning''' - C-F-A{{music|sharp}}-d{{music|sharp}}-g-c'-f' / C-F-B{{music|flat}}-e{{music|flat}}-g-c'-f'&lt;br /&gt;Half a step up from standard, used by [[Darwin's Waiting Room|Eddie Rendini]] during his time in [[Cold (band)|Cold]].
*'''C{{music|sharp}} tuning''' - C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}}-B-e-a-c{{music|sharp}}-f{{music|sharp}}&lt;br /&gt; The whole step up from standard. This tuning was used by [[Wes Borland]] with high E-string being lowered to C{{music|sharp}} (C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}}-B-e-a-c{{music|sharp}}-c{{music|sharp}}) on the first two [[Limp Bizkit]] records.

====Dropped====
These tunings have the added low 7th string tuned one full step lower allowing for chord structures similar to six-string drop tunings.
*'''Drop B''' - B-F{{music|sharp}}-B-E-A-C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}} / B-F{{music|sharp}}-B-E-G{{music|sharp}}-C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}} / B-G{{music|flat}}-B-E-A-D{{music|flat}}-G{{music|flat}}&lt;br /&gt; a tuning which combines the standard drop B tuning of a 6 string electric guitar, but with a high F{{music|sharp}} for soloing. Used by bands such as [[All Shall Perish]] and [[Assemble the Chariots]]
*'''Drop A''' - A-E-A-D-G-B-E&lt;br /&gt; A combination of standard 6 string tuning and a 7th string dropped one full step for power chords, used by [[deathcore]] bands such as [[Suicide Silence]], [[Oceano (band)|Oceano]], and [[Whitechapel (band)|Whitechapel]], as well as other bands such as [[Lacuna Coil]], [[Blotted Science]], [[In This Moment]], [[Chimaira]] (on [[Pass Out of Existence]] and [[Crown of Phantoms]]), and occasionally [[Scar Symmetry]], [[Escape the Fate]], [[King 810]], [[The Devil Wears Prada (band)|The Devil Wears Prada]], [[Dry Kill Logic]], Eldest 11, December In Red, A Fall To Break, and [[CFO$]] on some songs. Triumphant Return guitarist Matti varies this tuning by dropping both the low B to A and low E to D and raising the high B and E a half-step to C and F (A-D-A-D-G-C-F).
*'''Drop A''' - alternatively, A-E-A-D-F#-B-E&lt;br /&gt; The same as drop A tuning for a 6-string on the low strings while retaining a high E. In effect converts a 7-string into a drop A baritone guitar, but with standard tuning's soloing capability.
*'''Drop G{{music|sharp}}/Drop A{{music|flat}}''' -G{{music|sharp}}-D{{music|sharp}}-G{{music|sharp}}-C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}}-A{{music|sharp}}-D{{music|sharp}} / A{{music|flat}}-E{{music|flat}}-A{{music|flat}}-D{{music|flat}}-G{{music|flat}}-B{{music|flat}}-E{{music|flat}}&lt;br /&gt;One half step down from standard Drop A. Used by bands such as [[Trivium (band)|Trivium]] on some songs from [[Silence in the Snow]] and [[The Sin and the Sentence]], [[Destrophy]], [[TesseracT (band)|TesseracT]], [[Brian "Head" Welch]], [[After The Burial]] on some songs from their [[Rareform]], [[In Dreams (After the Burial album)|In Dreams]] and [[Dig Deep (album)|Dig Deep]] albums, [[Within the Ruins]], [[In Hearts Wake]] and [[Periphery (band)|Periphery]]. [[Jim Johnston (composer)|Jim Johnston]] used this tuning for the song "I Bring the Darkness (End of Days)".
*'''Drop G''' - G-D-G-C-F-A-D&lt;br /&gt;A full step from standard Drop A, used by such bands as [[Molotov Solution]], [[Impending Doom (American band)|Impending Doom]], [[Attack Attack!]] on their album [[This Means War (Attack Attack! Album)|This Means War]], [[Any Given Day]], [[Vildhjarta]], [[Whitechapel (band)|Whitechapel]] on some songs, [[Emmure]] and [[Born of Osiris]] since their album [[The Discovery (album)|The Discovery]].
*'''Drop F{{music|sharp}}/Drop G{{music|flat}}''' - F{{music|sharp}}-C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}}-B-E-G{{music|sharp}}-C{{music|sharp}} / G{{music|flat}}-D{{music|flat}}-G{{music|flat}}-B-E-A{{music|flat}}-D{{music|flat}}&lt;br /&gt;One and one half steps down from standard Drop A.

A continuation of the 7-string, adding another string a perfect fourth lower than the seven strings low B. The [[eight-string guitar|eight string guitars]] additional low F{{music|sharp}} string is just a whole step up from a bass guitars low E string. While [[luthiers]] have been building these instruments previously, mass-produced Eight-string electric guitars are a relatively recent innovation. Ibanez was first to offer a production eight-string guitar in March 2007.&lt;ref name="ibn8str"&gt;Official Ibanez Forums announcement: {{cite web |url=http://www.ibanez.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=4151&amp;PN=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070301171917/http://www.ibanez.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=4151&amp;PN=1 |archivedate=2007-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other companies now produce mass-market eight-string models, yet these guitars remain relatively uncommon.

*'''All fourths tuning''' - F{{music|sharp}}'-B'-E-A-d-g-c'-f'&lt;br /&gt;Regular tuning which extends range a half step higher.

====Dropped====
*'''Drop E/F{{music|flat}}''' - E-B-E-A-D-G-B-E&lt;br/&gt;A combination of standard 7-string tuning and an 8th string dropped one full step. Allows to play in the range of a standard electric bass, as well as power chords. Used by [[Animals as Leaders]]&lt;ref&gt;Guitar Player: [http://www.guitarplayer.com/miscellaneous/1139/tosin-abasi-and-javier-reyes/14033 Interview with Tosin Abasi and Javier Reyes]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Whitechapel (band)|Whitechapel]] (on the songs "Devolver" and "Breeding Violence" from ''[[A New Era of Corruption]]'').

Like Drop E, A; this tuning allows easy fingering on the E since it is a standard fourth interval below the A. It also provides three high strings a fourth apart instead of the usual two. The tuning is used by [[Infant Annihilator]] on their album ''[[The Elysian Grandeval Galèriarch]]''. A 7-string variation of the tuning without the high E (E-A-E-A-D-F{{music|sharp}}-B) was used on their previous album ''The Palpable Leprosy of Pollution'' and is used by [[Enterprise Earth]]/Delusions of Grandeur guitarist Gabe Mangold.

===Steel Guitar===
{{original research|section|date=March 2012}}
On [[table steel guitar]] and [[pedal steel guitar]], the most common tunings are the extended-chord [[C6 tuning]] and [[E9 tuning]], sometimes known as the ''Texas'' and ''Nashville'' tunings respectively. On a multiple-neck instrument, the near neck will normally be some form of C6, and the next closest neck E9.

Necks with 12 or more strings can be used with ''universal'' tunings which combine the features of C6 and E9. On a 12 string pedal steel guitar, all 12 strings are tuned and played individually, not as 6 double courses as on the [[12 string guitar]].

On [[lap steel guitar]] there is often only one six-string neck. C6 tuning is popular for these instruments, as are open G, E6, and [[E7 tuning]].

===Renaissance lute===
{{original research|section|date=March 2012}}

* '''Renaissance [[lute]] tuning:''' E-A-d-f{{music|sharp}}-b-e'

This tuning may also be used with a [[capo]] at the third fret to match the common lute pitch: G-c-f-a-d'-g'. This tuning also matches standard [[vihuela]] tuning and is often employed in classical guitar transcriptions of music written for those instruments, such as, for instance, "La Canción Del Emperador" and "Diferencias Sobre Guardame Las Vacas" by Renaissance composer [[Luis de Narváez]].

*'''"Pseudo Russian" or "g" tuning:''' D-G-d-g-b-e' --&gt;

'''''M.D.''''' was a short lived [[comic book]] published by [[EC Comics]] in 1955, the sixth title in its ''New Direction'' line. The bi-monthly comic was published by [[Bill Gaines]] and edited  by [[Al Feldstein]]. It lasted a total of five issues before being cancelled along with EC's other ''New Direction'' comics.

==Content==
''M.D.'' focused on medical stories, surgical practices and the day-to-day work of doctors. Each issue featured four stories, plus at least one text piece about a real-life major medical figure.

The frontispiece to the first issue set out its role:
{{cquote|This magazine, ''M.D.'', is the sixth of E.C.'s "New Direction" publications. It is dedicated to Mankind's tireless and unceasing battle against disease and to the man who fights that never-ending battle day after day after day... your Family Doctor... your M.D.

But although the M.D. is the protagonist in this magazine, he is not necessarily the hero! The ''real'' hero is the man, woman, or child who enters into the M.D.'s stirring and grim world of real medicine to seek out the help and relief his wisdom and experience can give.

This, then, is the theme of ''M.D.'' It will contain stories of ''people''... people who are helped by their Family Doctor and his associates in the Medical Profession. It will deal frankly and honestly with the diseases and misfortunes that beset people. It will deal graphically and candidly with the treatment they receive. At times, its stories will be poignant... at time they will be sad... at times they will be grim. But at all times, they will be ''true to life!''

And now, because we feel it best epitomizes the ideals of the Medical Profession, we, the editors of ''M.D.'' offer the view taken by all M.D.'s... "The Hippocratic Oath":}}
...the [[Hippocratic Oath]] was then reprinted in full.

The [[letters page]] (upon the first of which the above text appeared in lieu of early letters) was titled "The Needles", and contributors to ''M.D.'' include [[Graham Ingels]], [[Marie Severin]], [[George Evans (comics)|George Evans]], [[Joe Orlando]], [[Reed Crandall]] and [[Carl Wessler]].

==Reprints==
''M.D.'' was reprinted as part of publisher [[Russ Cochran (publisher)|Russ Cochran]]'s ''[[Russ Cochran (publisher)#The Complete EC Library|Complete EC Library]]'' collection, alongside ''[[Valor (EC Comics)|Valor]]'' and ''[[Impact (EC Comics)|Impact]]'' as Volume 2 of the "New Direction Part 2" slipcased set (1985). Between September 1999 and January 2000, Cochran and [[Gemstone Publishing]] reprinted the five individual issues. This complete run was later rebound, with covers included, in a single softcover ''[[Russ Cochran (publisher)#EC Annuals|EC Annual]]''.

'''Mary Agnes Meara Chase''' (April 29, 1869 – September 24, 1963) was an [[Americans|American]] [[botanist]] who worked at the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] and the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. She is "considered one of the world's outstanding agrostologists"&lt;ref name="SIA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Historical note |url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_216795 |work=SIA RU000229, United States National Museum Division of Grasses, Records, 1884, 1888, 1899-1965 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Archives |accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chase |first=Agnes |author2=A.S.

==Life and career==
[[File:Mary Agnes Chase Collecting Plants, Brazil, Image ID 96-548.tif|thumbnail|left|upright|Mary Agnes Chase collecting plants in Brazil, 1929&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_sic_9227 |title=Mary Agnes Chase Collecting Plants, Brazil |work=Smithsonian Institution Archives |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Chase was born in [[Iroquois County, Illinois]] and held no formal education beyond grammar school. Chase made significant contributions to the field of botany, authored over 70 scientific publications, and was conferred with an honorary doctorate in science from the University of Illinois.&lt;ref name="SIA" /&gt; She specialized in the study of grasses and conducted extensive field work in North and South America. Her field books from 1897 to 1959 are archived in the [[Smithsonian Institution Archives]].

In 1893, Mary had visited the Colombian Exposition in Chicago with her nephew, who was a botanist, and this had inspired her to study plants in Northern Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Chase, Mary Agnes (1869-1963)|url=http://plants.jstor.org/stable/10.5555/al.ap.person.bm000001409|language=en|publisher=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, Chase became a botanical assistant at the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] under [[Charles Frederick Millspaugh]], where her work was featured in two museum publications: [http://www.worldcat.org/title/plantae-utowanae/oclc/81635904 ''Plantae Utowanae''] (1900) and [http://www.worldcat.org/title/plantae-yucatanae-regionis-antillanae-plants-of-the-insular-coastal-and-plain-regions-of-the-peninsula-of-yucatan-mexico-1-compositae/oclc/165891529 ''Plantae Yucatanae''] (1904).&lt;ref name="notewomen"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Sicherman |editor-first=Barbara |title=Notable American women: The modern period: A biographical dictionary |year=1980 |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=146–148 |author=Carol Hurd Green, ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Chase joined the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) as a [[botanical illustrator]] and eventually became a scientific assistant in [[Agrostology|systematic agrostology]] (1907), assistant botanist (1923), and associate botanist (1925), all under [[A. S. Hitchcock|Albert Spear Hitchcock]]. Chase worked with Hitchcock for almost twenty years, collaborating closely and also publishing (''[http://www.worldcat.org/title/north-american-species-of-panicum/oclc/3764987 The North American Species of Panicum]'' [1910]).&lt;ref name="SIA" /&gt;

Following Hitchcock's death in 1936, Chase succeeded him to become senior botanist in charge of systematic agrostology and custodian of the Section of Grasses, Division of Plants at the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]]'s [[United States National Museum]] (USNM). Chase retired from the USDA in 1939 but continued her work as custodian of the USNM grass herbarium until her death in 1963.

==Women's Suffrage Movement==

Chase experienced discrimination based on her gender in the scientific field, for example, being excluded from expeditions to Panama in 1911 and 1912 because the expedition's benefactors feared the presence of women researchers would distract men.&lt;ref name=AfterVote&gt;{{cite book |last=Adams |first=Katherine H. |title=After the vote was won: The later achievements of fifteen suffragists |year=2010 |publisher=McFarland |pages=73–74 |author2=Michael L. Keene}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War I]], Chase marched with [[Alice Paul]] and was jailed several times for her activities. In 1918, she was arrested at the [[Silent Sentinels]] rally picketing the [[White House]]; she refused bail and was held for 10 days, where she instigated a hunger-strike and was force-fed.&lt;ref name=AfterVote /&gt; The USDA accused her of "conduct unbecoming a government employee," but Hitchcock helped her keep her job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henson |first=Pamela M. |year=2003 |title='What holds the earth together': Agnes Chase and American agrostology |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |volume=36 |issue=3 | doi = 10.1023/b:hist.0000004568.11609.2d |pages=437–460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chase was also an active member of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wedin |first=Walter F. |author2=Steven L.

The '''Mid-America Competing Band Directors Association (MACBDA)''', founded in {{Date|1972|format=dmy}}, is the only remaining summer [[high school]] [[marching band]] competition circuit in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.macbda.com/#!news|title=News|last=|first=|date=|work=www.macbda.com|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circuit's competitive season traditionally begins in June, and previously included field, parade, and concert band competitions throughout the [[Midwestern United States|midwest]]. As of {{Date|2018|format=dmy}}, all competitive events are in [[Wisconsin]] and are limited to field band competitions, with occasional parade band competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.macbda.com/#!schedule|title=Schedule|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-08-26|website=www.macbda.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{Date|2018|format=dmy}} circuit championship was at [[Perkins Stadium]], in [[Whitewater, Wisconsin]] on {{Date|14 Jul 2018|fomat=dmy}}.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.macbda.com/#!2018-results|title=2018 Results|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-08-26|website=www.macbda.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association had twenty-five member bands in {{Date|2008|format=dmy}}, but only five remain active as of {{Date|2018|format=dmy}}.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marching.com/events/macbda/|title=MACBDA Grand Championships|last=|first=|date=|website=www.marching.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.macbda.com/#!members|title=Members|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-08-26|website=www.macbda.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== About ==
MACBDA was founded in {{Date|1972|format=dmy}} by a group of high school band directors who wished to develop a summer competition circuit, similar to competitive [[Drum and bugle corps (modern)|junior drum corps]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A summer season was preferable, as average autumn temperatures in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] are often too cold for marching bands to perform successfully.

The circuit has hosted member bands from Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, and Minnesota.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Prior to 1991, bands competed in three activities; concert band, parade, and field band.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} As of {{Date|Jul 2018|format=dmy}}, only five field bands remain active.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Governance ===
The circuit is governed by a two executive officers, a President and Vice President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.macbda.com/#!contact|title=Contact|last=|first=|date=|work=www.macbda.com|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear how the circuit is organized, whether it be as a [[Public-benefit corporation#Oregon|public benefit]] [[nonprofit corporation]] or as an unincorporated entity, or in which state the circuit is registered. MACBDA is not an IRS [[501(c) organization|501(c)]] tax exempt organization.

=== Archive and past scores ===
No official archive of MACBDA's proceedings exists. And very few caption recaps or scores have been preserved from past competitions. The official website only lists score summaries for {{Date|2018|format=dmy}} competitions, and no recaps.

Some score summaries can be recovered via the [[Internet Archive]], or via [[fansite]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s such as {{URL|http://www.marching.com/|Marching.com}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marching.com/sitemap.html|title=MARCHING.COM: Site Map|website=www.marching.com|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==
Competing bands are often attached to high school band programs, and supported by [[Booster club|band booster clubs]]. Or bands are supported by [[Nonprofit organizations#United States|nonprofit organizations]] and accept performers from multiple schools or communities. All band members must be enrolled in high school, and may compete the summer following graduation.{{Efn|Rules and regulations published by MACBDA pertain only to field band competitions.}} However, bands that pre-date the founding of the circuit accept members up to age 21.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

== Competitive season ==
=== Classification ===
Bands are split between '''A''' and '''Open''' classes, based on the number of performing members.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A third class, '''AA''', was previously available according to results archived on Marching.com.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marching.com/events/2006/|title=MARCHING.COM: Scores from the 2006 Marching.com Featured Events|website=www.marching.com|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AAA''' Class was renamed '''Open''' class between {{Date|2006|format=dmy}} and {{Date|2007|format=dmy}}.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marching.com/events/2007/|title=MARCHING.COM: Scores from the 2007 Marching.com Featured Events|website=www.marching.com|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Field band adjudication ===
MACBDA utilizes a single-tier adjudication handbook for field band competitions. There are no adjustments or recommendations for scoring large and small bands. The annual [[Youth in Music Band Championships]] utilizes the MACBDA scoring format.

==== Captions and rubric ====
Scoring is based on two broad categories: '''Performance''', and '''Effect'''. The categories are further divided into four reference criteria or captions, with each given a maximum value of 200 points, or up to 20 points when factored. Percussion and Auxiliary, or [[Color guard (flag spinning)|color guard]], captions are also available. Each given a maximum value of 100 points, or ten points when factored.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.macbda.com/#!downloads|title=Downloads|last=|first=|date=|work=www.macbda.com|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final score is tabulated by adding all captions, less any penalties.

One adjudicator is assigned to each caption, and one one each to percussion and auxiliary. An additional adjudicator is responsible for timing and penalties. In addition to a tabulator, each competition requires eight personnel.

MACBDA does not have captions for [[Drum major|drum majors]], [[Baton twirling|twirling teams]] and majorettes, or [[Competitive dance|dance teams]]. Performance excellence by a drum major is recognized by the Effect or Performance adjudicators where appropriate. Twirlers and dance teams would fall under the responsibility of the Auxiliary adjudicator. Almost all participating bands will perform with a color guard team.

==== Placements and awards ====
Placements and total scores are announced for each class following the last band's performance. Caption awards are also announced for "High Music Execution", "High Visual Execution", "High Music General Effect", "High Visual General Effect", "High Percussion" and "High Auxiliary'. The awards recognize the highest placing band in each caption, regardless of class.

A Drum Major excellence award is also announced, but does not affect the overall score for any of the competing bands.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Parade band adjudication ===
Parade band adjudication falls under three captions: '''Marching''', '''Effect''', and '''Music'''. The two captions with the largest impact on a band's final score are Effect and Music, valued at up to 40 points each. Effect emphasizes overall ensemble performance, while music execution favors quality of tone and musical intonation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Parade competitions may have up to nine judges, three per caption. Scores are averaged within captions, and then totalled.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

'''National Book Tokens''' are a [[book token]] that is available in the UK and Ireland. They are solely owned and issued by Book Tokens Ltd (part of the Booksellers Association Group of Companies).

National Book Tokens are sold and accepted for exchange in almost all UK bookshops, including all major chains. The NBT scheme also sponsors the UK and Irish [[World Book Day]], as well as other literary events and awards such as ''The Telegraph'' Book Club Tour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/linlithgow-bookshop-selected-telegraph-tour.html|title=Linlithgow Bookshop selected for Telegraph tour - The Bookseller|website=www.thebookseller.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global Reads&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL1003/S00214.htm|title=Once Were Warriers Breaks Through To Top Ten - Scoop News|website=www.scoop.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the ''Daily Mail'' Book Club&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/books/article-318204/Mails-book-choice-storms-bestsellers-list.html|title=Mail's first book choice storms up bestsellers list|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Books Are My Bag Readers' Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalbooktokens.com/readers-awards|title=National Book Tokens|website=National Book Tokens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Book Tokens scheme was established in 1932, by publisher Harry Raymond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/nov/17/weekend.lucymangan|title=An appreciation of a token|first=Lucy|last=Mangan|date=17 November 2007|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original format of the tokens was as "lick-and-stick" stamp-like vouchers, which were glued into gift cards and had to be removed by the bookseller redeeming the token. In the 1990s, this design was changed to a "currency-style" voucher, available in a number of different denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalbooktokens.com/about-us/gallery/Brief-History.aspx|title=National Book Tokens|website=National Book Tokens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a redesign in 2003 the Book Tokens scheme was relaunched as National Book Tokens, with new vouchers designed by LMC Design. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/news/rss/186570/Book-Tokens-unveils-redesign-ahead-national-push/|title=Campaign: marketing, advertising and media news &amp; analysis|website=www.marketingmagazine.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the paper vouchers were phased out. They were replaced by National Book Token [[gift card|gift cards]] which were identified by a [[bar code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/busy-first-day-electronic-gift-cards.html?quicktabs_1=0|title='Busy' first day for electronic gift cards - The Bookseller|website=www.thebookseller.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nazi chic''' is the use of [[Nazi]]-era style, imagery, and [[paraphernalia]] in clothing and popular culture, especially when used for taboo-breaking or shock value rather than out of genuine sympathies with Nazism.

Its use began in the mid-1970s with the emergence of the [[Punk subculture|punk]] movement in London: the [[Sex Pistols]]' first television appearance occurred with [[Siouxsie Sioux]] wearing a [[swastika]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRNOUz7uefA "Today Show - Bill Grundy"] ''ITV''. December 1976. Retrieved 3 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Nazi chic was later used in the fashion industry in various occasions.

==Popular usage==
In the 1970s [[punk subculture]], several items of clothing designed to shock and offend [[The Establishment]] became popular. Among these [[punk fashion]] items was a [[T-shirt]] displaying a [[Swastika]], an upside-down [[crucifix]] and the word ''DESTROY''– which was worn by [[John Lydon|Johnny Rotten]] of the [[Sex Pistols]], seen in the video for "[[Pretty Vacant]]". Rotten wore the swastika another time with a gesture that looked like a [[Nazi salute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acc.umu.se/~samhain/summerofhate/punk.html |title=Punk and the Svastika |publisher=acc.umu.se |accessdate=1 July 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321032935/http://www.acc.umu.se/~samhain/summerofhate/punk.html |archivedate=21 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, [[Siouxsie Sioux]] of [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] was also known to wear a Swastika armband with fetish [[Sadomasochism|S and M]] clothing, including fishnets and a whip. These musicians are commonly thought to have worn such clothing for shock value directed towards [[Timeline of the United Kingdom home front during World War II|the British WWII generation]] rather than being genuinely associated with any [[National Socialist]] or [[fascist]] ideologies, and those with such interests likely became part of the [[Nazi punk]] or [[white power skinhead]] subcultures.

In 1984, two T-shirt designs featuring [[Adolf Hitler]] were produced in [[West Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5-toAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA367#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Charting the Divide Between Common and Civil Law|first=Thomas|last=Lundmark|date=15 August 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=13 October 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more famous of the two was the "Adolf Hitler European Tour" design, which featured a picture of Hitler against the backdrop of a map of [[Europe]], with conquered territories shaded; and tour dates given as:
*''September 1939 Poland''
*''April 1940 Norway''
*''May 1940 Luxembourg''
*''May 1940 Holland''
*''May 1940 Belgium''
*''June 1940 France''
*''&lt;s&gt;September 1940 England&lt;/s&gt; Cancelled''
*''April 1941 Jugoslavia''
*''May 1941 Greece''
*''June 1941 Crete''
*''A&lt;s&gt;ugust 1942 Russia&lt;/s&gt; Cancelled''
*''July 1945 Berlin Bunker.''

A less popular T-shirt featured Hitler giving the [[Roman salute]], and a [[yo-yo]] hanging from his hand. The text read "European yo-yo champion 1939-1945".

In an interview with ''[[Welt am Sonntag]]'', [[Bryan Ferry]], the English singer and musician, acknowledged that he calls his studio in west London his "[[Führerbunker]]". He was quoted as saying, "My God, the Nazis knew how to put themselves in the limelight and present themselves. ... [[Leni Riefenstahl|Leni Riefenstahl's]] movies and [[Albert Speer|Albert Speer's]] buildings and the mass parades and the flags - just amazing. Really beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bryan Ferry's Nazi Gaffe|publisher=The Independent|last=Goodchild|first=Sophie|date=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Later Ferry denied ever making this statement, and the newspapers printed a rectification.) The [[United States|American]] [[glam metal]] band [[Mötley Crüe]] inserted in the booklet of the album ''Mötley Crüe'' (1994) an image of [[Nikki Sixx]] dressed as a Nazi. Officially, the photo was related to lyrics about judging by appearances, but in actuality was inserted to mock the media.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The discographer decided to cancel that photo and to reprint the whole booklet. In the Mötley Crüe autobiography, ''[[The Dirt]]'', the band writes about their "Nazi Wednesdays", in which they used to walk down the street dressed in Nazi uniforms.{{Page needed|date=May 2015}}

English rock musician [[Lemmy]] of the band [[Motörhead]] collected Nazi memorabilia and had an [[Iron Cross]] on his bass guitar, but stated that he collected these memorabilia for aesthetic values only, and considered himself an [[anarchist]] or [[libertarian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=damage case|url=http://www.motorhead.ru/art11damagecase.htm|work=Russian MOTÖRHEAD Home page|accessdate=26 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120526042049/http://www.motorhead.ru/art11damagecase.htm|archivedate=26 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazi chic fashion can be seen in the music videos for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s "[[Justify My Love]]" (1990), [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]]'s "[[The Fight Song (Marilyn Manson song)|The Fight Song]]" (2001) and [[Lady Gaga]]'s "[[LoveGame]]" (2009).&lt;ref name=dazed&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/33523/1/nazi-chic-the-stylistic-legacy-of-the-night-porter| last=Hope Allwood| first=Emma| title=The most controversial tracks of all time| publisher=''[[Dazed]]''| date=October 31, 2016| accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nazi chic in fetish clothing ==
Nazi chic is a controversial topic in the [[fetish clothing]] [[subculture]]. The symbolism of fascistic ideologies remains popular, and a common compromise is to adopt the main design features of Nazi-era clothing– such as peaked caps, jackboots and trenchcoats– but not to include any explicit Nazi symbols. Sometimes substitute symbols are used, with designs that clearly reference the design styles of Nazi symbols without directly copying them.

Some clubs ban the wearing of the [[swastika]] or explicitly Nazi-style uniforms as part of their [[Dresscode (BDSM)|dresscode]].

== Nazi chic in Asia ==
[[File:Nichigeki dancing team musical revue Heil Hitler for Hitlerjugend 1938.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nichigeki]] dancing team musical revue ''Heil Hitler'' for Hitlerjugend 1938]] [[File:Japanese young ladies stage show for Hitlerjugend 1938.jpg|thumb|right|Young Japanese ladies in a stage show for visiting [[Hitlerjugend]] in 1938]]

Uniforms and other imagery related to [[Nazi Germany]] are sold in [[East Asia|East]] and [[South East Asia]], where some consider it fashionable. Hong Kong and Japan have each witnessed a growth in the casual wearing of [[SS uniform]]s, as well as increased interest in [[Rock Against Communism|White power music]]. Sometimes in East Asia, Nazi uniforms are used as part of [[cosplay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lesinrocks.com/2011/11/28/actualite/le-nazi-chic-la-nouvelle-mode-qui-fascine-de-jeunes-chinois-116107/ Le Nazi chic, la nouvelle mode qui fascine de jeunes Chinois] (french)&lt;/ref&gt; In South Korea, an area generally isolated from Nazi cultural influences during the Nazi era, [[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]] observed in 2000 "an unthinking fascination with the icons and imagery of the [[Third Reich]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/2000/0605/southkorea.trouble.html|title="They Dressed Well" A troubling fascination with Third Reich regalia elevates the Nazi look to what's chic in South Korea |journal=Time Asia|date=2000-06-05 |accessdate=2007-04-15|first=Donald|last=MacIntyre}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Indonesia, the Soldatenkaffe, a café featuring nazi decoration and memorabilia closed in 2013 due to controversies and critiques by international media as well as death threats and hate mail to the owners.

In some parts of the world, [[World War II]] is not taught in schools as a battle of political ideologies, but as a conventional war. This type of education treats Hitler and the [[Nazi Party]] as charismatic and powerful leaders of countries during wartime, instead of war criminals as elsewhere. [[George Burdi]], the former head of the [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] [[record label]] [[Resistance Records]], claimed to have sold many CDs to Japan, because [[Ehrenarier|some Japanese]] believe themselves to be the [[master race]] of the East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revoltns.blogspot.com/2009/10/george-burdi-interview.html|title=Revolt NS: George Burdi interview|first=|last=Revenge|date=8 October 2009|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Turkey, Hitler's book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' became a best-seller in early 2005 following price cuts and rising [[Turkish nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mein Kampf sales soar in Turkey |author=Helena Smith |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/29/turkey.books |newspaper=The Guardian |date=29 March 2005 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hitler's 'Mein Kampf' sells 50,000 copies in Turkey in three months |url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&amp;categ_id=4&amp;article_id=13511 |newspaper=The Daily Star via Agence France Presse |date=March 18, 2005 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Northumberlandia - facial shot.jpg|thumb|right|The head pictured from below showing lips, nostrils, eyes and forehead]]
'''''Northumberlandia''''' (the "Lady of the North") is a huge land sculpture in the shape of a reclining female figure, which was completed in 2012, near [[Cramlington]], [[Northumberland]], northern [[England]]. 

Made of 1.5 million tonnes of earth from neighbouring [[Shotton Surface Mine]], it is {{convert|34|m|ft|abbr=off}} high and {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=off}} long, set in a {{convert|19|ha|acre|abbr=off}} public park. Its creators claim that it is the largest land sculpture in female form in the world.&lt;ref name="cramlington" /&gt;

It is intended to be a major tourist attraction, with the developers hoping that it will attract an additional 200,000 visitors a year to Northumberland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

It has been nicknamed "[[Slag (disambiguation)#Other uses|Slag]] Alice" by some – a pun on [[spoil heap|slag]] (mining waste) and Slack Alice (an imaginary friend of comedian [[Larry Grayson]] and derogatory term for women).&lt;ref name=Mail&gt;{{Cite web

the sculpture was built on the [[Blagdon Hall|Blagdon Estate]], owned by [[Matthew White Ridley, 5th Viscount Ridley|Matt Ridley]], a journalist, businessman and author of ''[[The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature]]''.&lt;ref name=Mail/&gt;

The £2.5 million cost was borne by the Blagdon Estate and the [[Banks Group]], who carried out the construction work. The construction is part of the development of an adjacent [[open-cast mining|open-cast]] [[Coal-mining|coal mine]] at [[Shotton, Northumberland|Shotton]]. For this project, it was decided to use part of the excavated material to make a land sculpture rather than return it all to the surface mine, as is normally done at the end of such operations.

'''''Our English Coasts''''', also known as '''''Strayed Sheep''''', is an oil-on-canvas painting by [[William Holman Hunt]], completed in 1852.&lt;ref name=google&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/u/0/asset-viewer/our-english-coasts-1852-strayed-sheep/_wF_pFx9qFQ8vw|title=our-english-coasts-1852-strayed-sheep|publisher=/www.google.com/culturalinstitute|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been held by the [[Tate Gallery]] since 1946, acquired through [[The Art Fund]].

==Painter==
[[William Holman Hunt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preraphaelites.org/the-collection/artist-biography/william-holman-hunt/|title=william-holman-hunt|publisher=/www.preraphaelites.org|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a British painter, who co-founded the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] (1848), along with [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[John Everett Millais]]. The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood advocated a return to spirituality and sincerity of the arts, despising academic painting, which they considered a mere repetition of clichés.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/8048610&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Pre-Raphaelitism and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|publisher=http://worldcatlibraries.org|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/prb/1.html|title=The Pre-Raphaelites |publisher=www.victorianweb.org/|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;Despite these beliefs, the group created a number of works for institutes of higher learning in England. 
Under the [[Victorian era]] (1837–1901) the conservative academic aspect was represented by the [[Royal Academy]]. Among the more radical options was the movement [[Arts and Crafts]], led by [[William Morris]]. William Holman Hunt was somewhere in the middle.  Although he studied at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]], he rejected the style imposed by its founder [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/pre-raphaelites-victorian-avant-garde|title=pre-raphaelites-victorian-avant-garde|publisher=www.tate.org.uk|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/p/preraphaelite.html|title=Preraphaelites|publisher=www.artlex.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
After Holman Hunt's painting ''[[The Hireling Shepherd]]'' was acquired by [[William Broderip]], this work was commissioned by Broderip's cousin, [[Charles Theobald Maud]], as reproduction of the sheep in the background.  Maud was persuaded to accept a more adventurous composition.  He worked ''[[en plein air]]'' at the location depicted between August and December 1852, despite cold and rainy weather.    The painting combines features from different vantage points, with butterflies added in the studio modelled from life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hunt-our-english-coasts-1852-strayed-sheep-n05665/text-summary Our English Coasts, 1852 (‘Strayed Sheep’)], Tate Gallery&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting depicts a flock of sheep lining the picturesque coast of Sussex. The scenic location painted rests on the cliffs at [[Fairlight Glen]], beside [[Covehurst Bay]], near [[Hastings]], called the ''Lovers' Seat''. &lt;ref name=google/&gt;

The painting is painted in many layers, with brilliant colours, as many of Hunt's paintings are painted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/7697154/William_Holman_Hunt_and_the_Pre-Raphaelite_Technique_|title=the_Pre-Raphaelite_Technique|publisher=www.academia.edu|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy summer exhibition]] in 1853 under the title ''Our English Coasts'', but the frame bore the inscription "The Lost Sheep", and it was renamed ''Strayed Sheep'' when it was exhibited at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris in 1855.  It was acquired by the [[Tate Gallery]] in 1946, through [[The Art Fund]].

== History and Alumni ==
The society was founded in 1981 by [[Michael Hoffman (American director)|Michael Hoffman]], Peter Schwabach and [[Rick Stevenson]].  Its first production was the 1982 feature film ''[[Privileged (1982 film)|Privileged]]'', starring [[Hugh Grant]], [[James Wilby]], [[Imogen Stubbs]] and [[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]]. The film was directed by Michael Hoffman with [[John Schlesinger]], produced by Rick Stevenson and [[Mark Bentley]] with a score by [[Rachel Portman]].

Some of the original founders of the Oxford Film Foundation, including Rick Stevenson, Michael Hoffman, [[Andy Paterson]] and [[Mark Bentley (film producer)|Mark Bentley]], went on to form the [[Oxford Film Company]] in 1984. The [[Oxford Film Company]] instituted [[United Kingdom|Britain's]] first national screenwriting competition sponsored by [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Bank]] and later produced a series of feature films, including [[Hilary and Jackie]], while the revived and renamed Oxford University Film Foundation continues to produce films with the students of [[Oxford University]].

[[File:Premiere at Chinese Theater (3555047236).jpg|thumb|300px|Film premiere for ''[[Flatliners]]'', [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], Hollywood, 1990]]
A '''premiere''' or '''première''' is the [[wikt:debut|debut]] (first public presentation) of a [[Play (theatre)|play]], [[film]], [[dance]], or [[musical composition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=premiere
 |title = Premiere
 |work = WordNet | edition = 3.0 Online
 |publisher = [[Princeton University]]
 |accessdate = 11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A work will often have many premières: a world première (the first time it is shown anywhere in the world) and its first presentation in each country. When a work originates in a country that speaks a different language from that in which it is receiving its national or international première, it is possible to have two premières for the same work in the same country—for example, the play ''[[The Maids]]'' by the French dramatist [[Jean Genet]] received its British première (which also happened to be its world première) in 1952, in a production given in the French language. Four years later, it was staged again, this time in English, which was its English-language première in Britain. 
==History==
Raymond F. Betts attributes the introduction of the film premiere to showman [[Sid Grauman]], who founded [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5558">A '''quad chart''' is a form of [[technical documentation]] used to briefly describe an invention or other innovation through writing, illustration and/or photographs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.mod.uk/engagement/cde/quad_charts.aspx Quad Charts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330062910/http://www.science.mod.uk/engagement/cde/quad_charts.aspx |date=March 30, 2013 }} at the [[Defence Science and Technology Laboratory]] official website. [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|British Ministry of Defence]]. Accessed February 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Such documents are described as "quad" charts because they are divided into four quadrants laid out on a landscape perspective.&lt;ref&gt;NASA Technical Memorandum, Issues 4192-4200, pg. 3. [[Ames Research Center]], 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bob Paladino, ''Innovative Corporate Performance Management: Five Key Principles to Accelerate Results'', pg. 300.

Driskell and Jennifer King, "Conducting Applied Experimental Research." Taken from ''Laboratory Experiments in the Social Sciences'', part three, pg. 341. Eds. Murray Webster and Jane Sell. [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]]: [[Academic Press]], 2007. {{ISBN|9780123694898}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically one-page only; their succinctness facilitates rapid decision-making.&lt;ref name=gao&gt;[[Government Accountability Office]] report to the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]], [http://www.gao.gov/cbi-bin/getrpt?GAO-05-927 Managing for results enhancing agency use of performance information for management decision making]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, pg. 28. GAO-05-927, September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Though shorter, quad charts often serve in a similar capacity to [[white paper]]s and the two documents are often requested alongside one another.

==History==
Quad charts as a genre were developed by the [[United States Department of Commerce]]'s [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] in an attempt to improve budgeting and planning systems, and became widely used in the Administration's [[National Weather Service]].&lt;ref name=gao/&gt; The genre's development was parallel to that of [[display board]]s, also an early tool used by the NWS for staff communication.

In the early 2000s, software was developed to allow automated creation of quad charts as a means of saving time for [[technical writer]]s who would otherwise spend long periods of time drafting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Both government agencies and large businesses often require submission of a quad chart on the part of potential contractors as part of the contract bidding process.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130413184846/https://www.dtrasubmission.net/help/quadchart.asp Quad Chart], [[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]]. Accessed February 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100814192100/http://www.science.mod.uk/Engagement/CDE/temp/quad_charts.aspx Engagement] at Centre for Defence Enterprise. Accessed February 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASA]], for example, uses quad charts to document the process of all [[Small Business Innovation Research]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;The [[United States National Research Council]]'s ''An Assessment of the Small Business Innovation Research Program at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration'', pg. 120. [[Washington, D.C.]]: [[National Academies Press]], 2009. {{ISBN|9780309124423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because decision makers often review a large volume of both solicited and unsolicited proposals, the quad chart may be the only submission from a potential contractor which the decision maker actually reads.&lt;ref name=lab/&gt;

Due to the nature of quad charts as relatively short documents, there are opportunities for misuse. While quad charts are intended for brief overviews of a topic, they can also be misconstrued to influence public policy and budgeting decisions, as was the case with the politicization of the [[National Military Strategy (United States)|National Defense Strategy]]'s 2005 edition.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan P. Freier, "Present at the Counterrevolution: An Essay on the 2005 National Defense Strategy and Its Impact on Policy." Taken from the [[United States Army War College]] ''Guide to National Security Issues, Volume 2: National Security Policy and Strategy'', pgs. 120-121. Ed. J. Boone Bartholomees, Jr. 4th ed. July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
While there are no industry-wide standards for quad charts, there are a number of common elements. In addition to the title of the invention or idea and the name of the developer, the technical approach and the need which the invention or idea addresses are often included.&lt;ref name=lab/&gt; Decision makers often look to operational needs first, though including the cost and projected schedule are also often required elements.

In [[papyrus]] rolls and [[manuscripts]], a '''''reclamans''''' (plural: ''reclamantes'') is a catchline included at the end of a section of text showing the first line or sentence of the subsequent roll or [[codex]], thus ensuring that the reader could quickly determine the proper order in which the particular work was to be read.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|West|1963|p=314}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is well-attested in [[Homeric]] papyri, but it appears to have fallen into disuse in these texts around the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|West|1963|p=315}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems very likely that the increased popularity of inscribing each roll with a book title precipitated the obsolescence of the ''reclamans''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|West|1963|p=315}}, {{harvtxt|Schironi|2010|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of prose works, however, the practice continued to be used, and several medieval manuscripts of works like [[Herodotus]]' ''Histories'' and the [[Hippocratic Corpus]] include ''reclamantes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Schironi|2010|p=74–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Busto maschile.JPG|thumb|[[Roman portraiture]] fresco of a young man with a [[papyrus]] [[scroll]], from [[Herculaneum]], 1st century AD]]
A '''''rotulus''''' (plural: ''rotuli'') is a kind of roll consisting of a long and narrow strip of writing material, historically [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]], that is wound around a wooden axle or rod and is written on its interior face or side&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Grout |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/scroll/scrollcodex.html |title=Scroll and Codex |website=Encyclopaedia Romana}}&lt;/ref&gt; such that it is unwound vertically so that the writing runs parallel to the rod,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/whats-on/online/crossing-borders/codex |title=What's On?: From Roll to Codex |website=Bodleian Libraries |publisher=University of Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; unlike the other kind of roll, namely the "[[scroll]]", whose writing runs perpendicular to the rod in multiple columns.

''Rotuli'' were historically used for:

*Specific legal records in [[Europe]], from which is still derived the title of the judicial functionary denominated the "[[Master of the Rolls]]", and the [[Byzantine Empire]];&lt;ref name="daly"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daly|first1=Lloyd W.|title=Rotuli: Liturgy Rolls and Formal Documents|journal=Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies|date=1973|volume=14|issue=3|publisher=Duke University|url=http://grbs.library.duke.edu/article/viewFile/9191/4607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both are located three blocks north of the [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral]] following Republica de Brasil Street with Belisario Dominguez Street separating the two.&lt;ref name="lonely"&gt;{{cite book |title= Lonely Planet Mexico City |last=Noble |first=Joshn |authorlink= |year=2000 |publisher=Lonely Planet Publications |location=Oakland, CA |isbn=1-86450-087-5  |pages=113–114 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is all that is left from the first [[monastery]] to be established in [[New Spain]].&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; (The first monastery in New Spain was established by Franciscans, not Dominicans. This was not the first monastery. In fact, the Dominicans who arrived in New Spain in 1526 had to take up temporary quarters at the neighboring Franciscan convent. The citation comes from the Galindo sisters, and, like many others, it is incorrect.) This monastery was established soon after the Dominicans arrived to New Spain in 1526. They moved into houses that were donated to them by the Guerrero family, where later the [[Palace of the Inquisition (Museum of Mexican Medicine)|Palace of the Inquisition]] would be built. The initially replaced the houses to found a church, living quarters and a jail for those found guilty of religious crimes. (The Dominicans were in charge of the Inquisition.) A couple of decades later, it was decided that expansion was needed and the first church on the Santo Domingo site was consecrated in 1590. Around it was built the monastery, funded by [[Philip II of Spain]], with four patios which divided the monks and laypeople associated with the monastery by rank as well as a main hall, a rectory, a library and an infirmary. However, poor construction, the soft soil and earthquakes made rebuilding a necessity.&lt;ref name="oficial"&gt;{{cite book

It is [[Baroque architecture]] made of pink stone,&lt;ref name="lonely"/&gt; begun in 1717 and finished in 1736.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; The monastery and atrium that the church used to be part of was destroyed in 1861 during anti-clerical movement, destroying the chapel of Del Rosario and Tercera Orden as well. This opened up what is now Leandro Valle Street on the church's west side.&lt;ref name="promexa"&gt;{{cite book |title= Guia Turisitica de Mexico-Distrito Federal |last=Bueno de Ariztegui (ed) |first=Patricia |year=1984 |publisher=Promexa |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-34-0319-0  |language=Spanish |page=71  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its style, the church is attributed to [[Pedro de Arrieta]]. The general style is considered to be Mexican [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] but before the introduction of the common "estipite" column with its signature inverted truncated pyramids. The front facade is covered in tezontle, a blood-colored volcanic stone and the portal is made mostly of cantera, a white/grey stone.&lt;ref name="promexa"/&gt; It has twelve columns around the main entrance,&lt;ref name="lonely"/&gt; with Saint Francis and [[Saint Augustine]] on the first floor. On the second floor, a stone relief depicts Saint Dominic kneeling as he receives the keys of heaven from [[Saint Peter]] and the [[Epistles]] from [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] as the [[Holy Spirit]] rises above the group.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; In the center at the top is a [[bas relief]] of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]&lt;ref name="lonely"/&gt; located between two windows that light the choir area.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; It is decorated on the east side with stone figures of [[Saint Dominic]] and [[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis]]. Their arms are intertwined&lt;ref name="lonely"/&gt; and shown to be literally holding up the [[Church of Letrán]].&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

Inside, the floor plan of the church is that of a Latin cross.&lt;ref name="promexa"/&gt; The main [[altarpiece]] is [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] and the work of [[Manuel Tolsá]],&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; which was created to replace the original Baroque one done by Pedro Patiño Ixtolinque.&lt;ref name="promexa"/&gt; The altar to the left of the [[transept]] is dedicated to the [[Virgin of Covadonga]]. On a wall in the wide central area, there is a large [[niche (architecture)|niche]] containing the image of the Virgin Mary. Above this is a sculpture depicting the scene at the [[Calvary]]. Higher still is an oil painting of the Coronation of Mary and at the crest is the cross of the [[Battle of Covandonga]] between two windows. Each of the lateral windows has two oil paintings decorating them and finished with the [[coat-of-arms]] of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] as well as the emblem of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] order. This area is completed with the reliefs of saints and the carvings of [[cherub]]s. At the right of the transept, there is the [[Virgin del Camino]] altarpiece created by [[Alonso López de Herrera]]. The altarpiece contains figures called the "Descent," "Saint Dominic in Soriano," and gilded statues of the martyrs Saint Peter and [[Vincent Ferrer|Vicente Ferrer]].&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; The church also has a [[choir (architecture)|choir]] in the shape of a horseshoe with 32 seats made of cedar, each with an image of a different saint carved in relief into the backs.&lt;ref name="promexa"/&gt;

Next to it is the neo-Baroque Rosario Chapel which dates from 1946.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

==The Plaza==
[[File:Santo Domingo (Mexico City).jpg|thumb|Plaza San Domingo, Portal de Evangelistas and Church of Santo Domingo]]

To the south of the church is Plaza San Domingo. It is flanked to the west by the Portal de Evangelistas,&lt;ref name="lonely"/&gt; which is a Tuscan colonnade with round arches.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; Scribes with typewriters and antique printing machines work in this Portal.&lt;ref name="lonely"/&gt; Scribes offer their services to illiterate clients, often offering services similar to that of lawyers, counselors, and financial consultants. A statue of [[Josefa Ortiz de Dominguez]], a heroine of the [[Mexican War of Independence]] stands in a fountain in the middle of the plaza. It was sculpted by [[Enrique Alcati]].&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

Unfortunately, this area is also very well known for the falsification of documents. According to the intelligence division of the Policia Judicial of the Distrito Federal, in addition to the 242 print shops that operate legally in this zone, there have noted 614 cases of printers set up to falsify documents in the various apartments and other living quarters that surround this area. Most of these are located on La Plaza 23 de Mayo, República de Cuba, República de Chile an Justo Sierra Streets.&lt;ref name="Torres"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mario |last=Torres |title= Ubican centrod de falsificacion en Santo Domingo|url=http://www.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/mexico/503510.html |work= |publisher=Televisa |location=Mexico City |date=2006-01-12 |accessdate=2008-10-05 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small church called San Lorenzo-Deacon and Martyr, is located at 28 Belisario Dominguez, to the left of the facade of the Santo Domingo Church.&lt;ref name="torreon"&gt;{{cite news |title=En riesgo templos del Centro Histórico del DF |url=http://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/367782.en-riesgo-templos-del-centro-historico-del-df.html# |publisher=El Siglo de Torreon |agency=Notimex |date=2008-07-28 |accessdate=April 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This small church is the descendent of a number of chapels that have been on this spot, and that in the 16th century was one of four chapels that were at the corners of the monastery property.  One of the oldest structures that was at this spot was called the "Chapel of the "Morenos"" (dark-skinned), named so because here is where the Dominican friars evangelized to the indigenous population. The church currently at the spot originally had 4 altars, dedicated to the crucified Christ, the rosary, [[Saint Joseph]] and [[Saint Dismas]] respectively. However, these have long since been replaced with one simple altar. The portal of the church is from the 19th century with a simple arch on posts decorated with sculpted vegetation. Above this is a monogram of Christ's name.&lt;ref name="oficial"&gt;{{cite book

'''''Singerie''''' is the name given to a visual arts [[genre]] depicting [[monkeys]] imitating human behavior, often fashionably attired, intended as a diverting sight, always with a gentle cast of mild [[satire]].  The term is derived from the [[French language|French]] word for "Monkey Trick".

==History==
The practise can be traced as far back as Ancient Egypt; [[Cyril Aldred]] detected a love of ''singerie'' that he found characteristic of the late [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt]];&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Alfred, 1955. ''New Kingdom Art in Ancient Egypt''&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the medieval period in Europe, monkeys were seen "as a symbol of downgraded humanity",&lt;ref name="Duffy2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean H. Duffy|title=Signs and Designs: Art and Architecture in the Work of Michel Butor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c1CgfS5boKoC&amp;pg=PA267|year=2003|publisher=Liverpool University Press|isbn=978-0-85323-788-4|pages=267–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were used to mimic man and his foibles, often appearing in the margins of illuminated manuscripts.&lt;ref name="Garnier-PelleForray-Carlier2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicole Garnier-Pelle|author2=Anne Forray-Carlier|author3=Marie-Christine Anselm|title=The Monkeys of Christophe Huet: Singeries in French Decorative Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FxxvkgAACAAJ|year=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|isbn=978-1-60606-065-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor1807"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Taylor|title=The Literary Panorama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A94RAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PT427|year=1807|pages=427|quote=The prayer book written for Charles V. of Austria by his mistress, had, on every page, monkeys mimicking religious ceremonies, in the most incongruous manner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comical scenes with monkeys appearing in human attire and a human environment originated as a pictorial genre in [[Flemish painting]] in the 16th century and were further developed in the 17th century. The Flemish engraver [[Pieter van der Borcht the Elder|Pieter van der Borcht]] introduced the singerie as an independent theme around 1575 in a series of prints, which are strongly embedded in the artistic tradition of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]].  These prints were widely disseminated and the theme was then picked up by other Flemish artists, in particular by those in Antwerp such as [[Frans Francken the Younger]], [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Younger|the Younger]], [[Sebastiaen Vrancx]] and [[Jan van Kessel the Elder]]. [[David Teniers the Younger]] became the principal practitioner of the genre and developed it further with his younger brother [[Abraham Teniers]].  The two brothers were able to cater to the prevailing taste in the art market and were thus instrumental in spreading the genre outside Flanders.  Later in the 17th century artists like [[Nicolaes van Verendael]], principally known as a painter of flower [[still life]]s started to paint ‘monkey scenes’ as well.&lt;ref&gt;Bert Schepers, ''Monkey Madness in Seventeenth-Century Antwerp'', in: The Rubenianum Quarterly, 2012 2, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Antoine Watteau 032.jpg|thumb|left|A copy of ''The Monkey Sculptor'', originally painted c. 1710 by [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Antoine Watteau]]]] 
''Singeries'' became popular among French artists in the early 18th century. French decorator and designer [[Jean Berain the Elder]] included dressed figures of monkeys in many wall decorations, the great royal ''[[ébéniste]]'' [[André Charles Boulle]] used them in his work&lt;ref&gt;R.H. Randall Jr, "Templates for Boulle Singerie" ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''111''' No. 798 (September 1969), pp. 549-553.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Watteau]] painted ''The Monkey Sculptor'', a critique of art and artists' habit of "aping" nature.&lt;ref name="Impelluso2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lucia Impelluso|title=Nature and Its Symbols|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8LtPeLH3iHYC&amp;pg=PA201|year=2004|publisher=Getty Publications|isbn=978-0-89236-772-6|pages=201–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A complete monkey orchestra was produced in [[Meissen porcelain]]. In France the most famous such rococo decor are [[Christophe Huet]]'s ''Grande Singerie'' and ''Petite Singerie'' decors at the [[Château de Chantilly]]; in England the French painter [[Andieu de Clermont]] is also known for his ''singeries'': the most famous decorates the ceiling of the Monkey Room at Monkey Island Hotel, located on [[Monkey Island, Bray|Monkey Island]] in [[Bray-on-Thames]], [[England]]. The Grade I listed buildings, which have housed guests since 1840 were built in the 1740s by [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough]].
[[File:Emmanuel Noterman - The art experts.jpg|thumb|260px|''The art experts'' by [[Emmanuel Noterman]]]]

Singeries regained popularity in the 19th century and artists then successful in this genre included [[Zacharie Noterman]], [[Emmanuel Noterman]], Sir Edwin [[Henry Landseer]], [[Edmund Bristow]], [[Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps]], Charles Monginot and [[Paul Friedrich Meyerheim]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artoftheprint.com/artistpages/noterman_zacharias_the_litigants.htm Zacharias Noterman, ''Les Plaideurs ('The Litigants')] at Art of the Print&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stendhal syndrome''', '''Stendhal's syndrome''', '''hyperkulturemia''', or '''Florence syndrome''' is a [[psychosomatic]] disorder that causes [[Tachycardia|rapid heartbeat]], dizziness, [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting]], confusion and even [[hallucination]]s when an individual is exposed to an experience of great personal significance, particularly viewing [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1136/bcr.06.2008.0317| title = Stendhal syndrome: A case of cultural overload| journal = Case Reports| volume = 2009| pages = bcr0620080317| year = 2009| last1 = Nicholson | first1 = T.

==History==
[[File:Stendhal.jpg|thumb|upright|Stendhal syndrome was named after Marie-Henri Beyle (1783–1842), better known by his penname [[Stendhal]].]]
The illness is named after the 19th-century French author [[Stendhal]] (pseudonym of Marie-Henri Beyle), who described his experience with the phenomenon during his 1817 visit to [[Florence]] in his book ''Naples and Florence: A Journey from Milan to Reggio''.

When he visited the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Basilica of Santa Croce]], where [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Galileo Galilei]] are buried, he was overcome with emotion. He wrote:{{quote|I was in a sort of ecstasy, from the idea of being in Florence, close to the great men whose tombs I had seen. Absorbed in the contemplation of sublime beauty ... I reached the point where one encounters celestial sensations ... Everything spoke so vividly to my soul. Ah, if I could only forget. I had palpitations of the heart, what in Berlin they call 'nerves'. Life was drained from me. I walked with the fear of falling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=OxyNfsmXfYEC&amp;pg=PA196 | title=Interfaces of Performance | editor-first1=Maria |editor-last1= Chatzichristodoulou | editor-first2=Janis |editor-last2= Jefferies |editor-first3=Rachel |editor-last3= Zerihan | publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year= 2009 |page= 196 |isbn= 9781409486145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He had been shown the frescoes in the church including those by [[Giotto]], and modern writers frequently attribute his emotions mistakenly to the latter rather than powerful historical associations of the tombs. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Although psychiatrists have long debated whether it really exists, its effects on some sufferers are serious enough for them to require treatment in hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/15/world/florence-s-art-makes-some-go-to-pieces.html |title=Florence's Art Makes Some Go to Pieces |location=Italy; Florence (Italy) |work=The New York Times |date=15 May 1989 |accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The staff at Florence's Santa Maria Nuova hospital are accustomed to dealing with tourists suffering from dizzy spells and disorientation after admiring the statue of David, the masterpieces of the Uffizi Gallery and other treasures of the Tuscan city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/7914746/Scientists-investigate-Stendhal-Syndrome-fainting-caused-by-great-art.html |title=Scientists investigate Stendhal Syndrome – fainting caused by great art |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=28 July 2010 |accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though there are many descriptions of people becoming dizzy and fainting while taking in Florentine art, especially at the aforementioned [[Uffizi]] in Florence, dating from the early 19th century on, the syndrome was only named in 1979, when it was described by Italian psychiatrist [[Graziella Magherini]], who observed and described more than 100 similar cases among tourists and visitors in Florence. There is no scientific evidence to define the Stendhal syndrome as a specific psychiatric disorder; on the other hand there is evidence that the same cerebral areas involved in emotional reactions are activated during the exposure to artworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |last1=Innocenti |first1=Claudia |last2=Fioravanti |first2=Giulia |last3=Spiti |first3=Raffaello |last4=Faravelli |first4=Carlo |title=La sindrome di Stendhal fra psicoanalisi e neuroscienze |journal=Rivista di Psichiatria |date=1 March 2014 |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=61–66  |doi=10.1708/1461.16139|pmid=24770571 |issn=2038-2502  |trans-title=[The Stendhal syndrome between psychoanalysis and neuroscience]. |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Raymon de Peñaforte.jpg|thumb|[[Raymond of Peñafort]] founded one of the first schools of the ''Studia Linguarum''.]]
The '''''Studia Linguarum''''' (literally "Language Institutes") were the first attempt to [[Oriental studies|study oriental languages]] by the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic Church]].{{sfn|McCabe|2008|p=29}} The need to study oriental languages was affirmed by the General Chapter of the [[Dominican Order]] in [[Paris]] in 1236.{{sfn|Lindberg|1978|p=77}} The objective of the schools was to help the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] liberate Christian captives in Islamic lands.{{sfn|McCabe|2008|p=29}}

==Description==
The first school of the ''Studia Linguarum'' was established in [[Tunis]] by [[Raymond of Peñafort]] in the early 13th century, where it was also designated as the ''Studium arabicum''.{{sfn|McCabe|2008|p=29}}{{sfn|Lindberg|1978|p=77}}It is known that in 1250, the Provincial Chapter of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] sent 8 friars to the Tunis institute to study Arabic, including the famous Arabist [[Ramon Marti]].{{sfn|Lindberg|1978|p=77}} The school permitted some students to learn [[Arabic]] during the second half of the 13th century.{{sfn|Lindberg|1978|p=77}}

As a side effect of the establishment of these institutes, some Arabic scientific works were also translated in European languages, such as the ophthalmological work ''Liber Oculorum'' of [[Ali ibn Isa al-Kahhal|Ali Ibn Isa]] (Jesu Haly) by Friar [[Dominicus Marrochini]] of the ''Studium'' of [[Murcia]].{{sfn|Lindberg|1978|p=77}}

In 1311, the [[Council of Vienne]] further decided to create schools for the study of oriental languages in the universities of [[Paris]], [[Bologna]], [[Oxford]], [[Salamanca]] and [[Rome]].{{sfn|McCabe|2008|p=29}}

'''''The Coming Global Superstorm''''' ({{ISBN|0-671-04190-8}}) is a 1999 book by [[Art Bell]] and [[Whitley Strieber]], which warns that [[global warming]] might produce sudden and catastrophic [[climate|climatic]] effects.

* First, the [[Gulf Stream]] and [[North Atlantic drift]] would generate a cordon of warm water around the [[North Pole]], which in turn, holds in a frozen mass of Arctic air.
* Second, if the North Atlantic drift [[Shutdown of thermohaline circulation|were to shut down]], that barrier would fail, releasing a flood of frozen air into the [[Northern Hemisphere]], causing a sudden and drastic temperature shift.

The book discusses a possible cause of the failure of the Gulf Stream: the melting of the [[polar ice cap]]s could drastically affect the [[salinity]] of the North Atlantic drift by dumping a large quantity of freshwater into the world's oceans.

Bell and Strieber explain the possibility that such current destabilizations have occurred before, as well as seemingly impossible engineering feats by the ancients. Among their examples is the island city of [[Nan Madol]]. The book claims that its construction, with exacting tolerances and extremely heavy basalt materials, necessitates a high degree of technical competency. Since no such society exists in the modern record or even, in legend, the society must have been destroyed by dramatic means.

While other explanations beside a global [[meteorological event]] are possible, a correlating evidence set is presented in the woolly mammoth. Strieber and Bell assert that since mammoths have been found preserved with food still in their mouths and undigested in their stomachs, these animals must have been killed quickly, in otherwise normal conditions. They were preserved so well by quick freezing, which is taken as evidence of a rapid onset of a global blizzard or similar event.

Interspersed with the analytical parts of the book are a series of interlinked short fictional scenarios, written in italics, describing what might transpire today if a destabilization of the North Atlantic Current were to occur. The fictional accounts of "current events" as the meteorological situation deteriorates provided background and inspiration for the 2004 science fiction film ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]''. Indeed, some events from the book are portrayed in the film with little modification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/05/0518_040518_dayafter.html|title=National Geographic News: Day After Tomorrow Movie: Could Ice Age Occur Overnight?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Diary of a Young Girl''''', also known as '''''The Diary of Anne Frank''''', is a book of the writings from the [[Dutch language]] [[diary]] kept by [[Anne Frank]] while she was in hiding for two years with her family during the [[Netherlands in World War II|Nazi occupation of the Netherlands]]. The family was apprehended in 1944, and Anne Frank died of [[typhus]] in the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] in 1945. The diary was retrieved by [[Miep Gies]], who gave it to Anne's father, [[Otto Frank]], the family's only known survivor, just after the war was over. The diary has since been published in more than 60 languages.

First published under the title '''''Het Achterhuis. Dagboekbrieven 14 Juni 1942 – 1 Augustus 1944''''' (''The Annex: Diary Notes 14 June 1942 – 1 August 1944'') by Contact Publishing in Amsterdam in 1947, the diary received widespread critical and popular attention on the appearance of its English language translation ''Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl'' by [[Doubleday &amp; Company]] (United States) and [[Vallentine Mitchell]] (United Kingdom) in 1952. Its popularity inspired the 1955 play ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (play)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' by the screenwriters [[Frances Goodrich]] and [[Albert Hackett]], which they adapted for the screen for [[The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)|the 1959 movie version]]. The book is included in several lists of the top books of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=[[Goodreads]] |url=http://www.goodreads.com/list/show/6.Best_Books_of_the_20th_Century |title=Best (100) Books of the 20th Century] #8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jun/02/uk.hay2007authors |title=Top 10) definitive book(s) of the 20th century}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.panmacmillan.com/displayPage.asp?PageID=4939 |title=50 Best Books defining the 20th century |website=PanMacMillan.com }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[National Review]] |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/100best/100_books.html |title=List of the 100 Best Non-Fiction Books of the Century, #20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=[[New York Public Library]] |url=http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/events/booklist.html |title=Books of the Century: War, Holocaust, Totalitarianism |date=1996 |isbn=978-0-19-511790-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=[[Waterstone's]] |url=http://www.wesselenyi.com/top100books.htm |title=Top 100 Books of the 20th century, while there are several editions of the book.

The [[copyright]] of the Dutch version of the diary, published in 1947, expired on 1 January 2016, 70 years after the author's death as a result of a general rule in [[copyright law of the European Union]].

==Background==
During the [[Netherlands in World War II|Nazi occupation of the Netherlands]], Anne Frank received a blank diary as one of her presents on June 12, 1942, her 13th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Anne Frank Diary Anniversary Marks the Day Holocaust Victim Received Autograph Book as a Birthday Present (PHOTO) |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/12/anne-frank-diary-anniversary_n_3430185.html |accessdate=April 29, 2014 |newspaper=The Huffington Post |date=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=birthday&gt;{{cite news |title=Anne Frank's birthday on theme of diary's 70th anniversary |url=http://www.annefrank.org/en/News/News/2012/June/Anne-Franks-birthday-/ |accessdate=April 29, 2014 |newspaper=Anne Frank House |date=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Anne Frank House]], the red, checkered [[autograph book]] which Anne used as her diary was actually not a surprise, since she had chosen it the day before with her father when browsing a bookstore near her home.&lt;ref name=birthday /&gt; She began to write in it on June 14, 1942, two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl: June 14, 1942 – November 17, 1942 |url=http://computerkiddoswiki.pbworks.com/f/anne+frank+review.pdf |work=edHelper.com |accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Diary of Anne Frank Learning Guide: Table of Contents |url=http://www.shmoop.com/diary-of-anne-frank/table-of-contents.html |publisher=Shmoop University, Inc. |accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 5, 1942, Anne's older sister [[Margot Frank|Margot]] received an official summons to report to a [[Concentration camp|Nazi work camp]] in Germany, and on July 6, Margot and Anne went into hiding with their father [[Otto Frank|Otto]] and mother [[Edith Frank|Edith]]. They were joined by [[Hermann van Pels]], Otto's business partner, including his wife [[Auguste van Pels|Auguste]] and their teenage son [[Peter van Pels|Peter]].&lt;ref name=biography&gt;{{cite news |title=Anne Frank Biography (1929–1945) |url=http://www.biography.com/people/Anne-frank-9300892?page=2#awesm=~oCNoo0CO48Wzuc |accessdate=April 29, 2014 |newspaper=Biography.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429170631/http://www.biography.com/people/anne-frank-9300892?page=2#awesm=~oCNoo0CO48Wzuc |archivedate=April 29, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their hiding place was in the sealed-off upper rooms of the annex at the back of Otto's company building in [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name=biography /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The hiding place – A bookcase hides the entrance |url=http://www.annefrank.org/en/Anne-Frank/Not-outside-for-2-years/-The-Secret-Annex/ |accessdate=April 29, 2014 |newspaper=Anne Frank House}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otto Frank started his business, named Opekta, in 1933. He was licensed to manufacture and sell [[pectin]], a substance used to make jam. He stopped running his business while everybody was in hiding. But once he returned, he found his employees running it. The rooms that everyone hid in were concealed behind a [[sliding bookcase|movable bookcase]] in the same building as Opekta. Mrs. van Pels's dentist, [[Fritz Pfeffer]], joined them four months later. In the published version, names were changed: The van Pelses are known as the Van Daans, and Fritz Pfeffer as Albert Dussel. With the assistance of a group of Otto Frank's trusted colleagues, they remained hidden for two years and one month.

In August 1944, they were discovered and deported to Nazi concentration camps. They were long thought to have been betrayed, although there are indications that their discovery may have been accidental, that the police raid had actually targeted "ration fraud".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38349353 |title=Anne Frank may have been discovered by chance, new study says |date=December 17, 2016 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the eight people, only Otto Frank, the oldest, survived the war. Anne died when she was 15 years old in [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]], from typhus. The exact date of her death is unknown, and has long been believed to be in early March, a few weeks before the prisoners were liberated by British troops in April 1945. However, new research in 2015 indicated that Anne may have died in February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Park, Madison |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/01/europe/anne-frank-date-of-death/ |title=Researchers say Anne Frank perished earlier than thought |work=CNN |date=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In manuscript, her original diaries are written over three extant volumes. The first volume (the red-and-white checkered autograph book) covers the period between June 14 and December 5, 1942. Since the second surviving volume (a school exercise book) begins on December 22, 1943, and ends on April 17, 1944, it is assumed that the original volume or volumes between December 1942 and December 1943 were lost - presumably after the arrest, when the hiding place was emptied on Nazi instructions. However, this missing period is covered in the version Anne rewrote for preservation. The third existing volume (which was also a school exercise book) contains entries from April 17 to August 1, 1944, when Anne wrote for the last time before her arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ten questions on the authenticity of the diary of Anne Frank |url=http://www.annefrank.org/ImageVaultFiles/id_14671/cf_21/tenquestions_en.pdf |publisher=Anne Frank Stichting |accessdate=April 27, 2014 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

The manuscript, written on loose sheets of paper, was found strewn on the floor of the hiding place by [[Miep Gies]] and [[Bep Voskuijl]] after the family's arrest,&lt;ref name=DefEdition&gt;{{cite book |title=The Diary of a Young Girl: The Definite Edition |last=Frank |first=Anne |year=1997 |publisher=Bantam Books |isbn=0553577123 |page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; but before their rooms were ransacked by the Dutch police and the [[Gestapo]]. They were kept safe, and given to Otto Frank after the war, with the original notes, when Anne's death was confirmed in the spring of 1945.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Format==
The diary is not written in the classic forms of "Dear Diary" or as letters to oneself; Anne calls her diary "Kitty", so almost all of the letters are written to Kitty. Anne used the above-mentioned names for her annex-mates in the first volume, from September 25, 1942 until November 13, 1942, when the first notebook ends.&lt;ref name=about.com&gt;{{cite news |last=Rosenberg |first=Jennifer |title=5 Things You Don't Know about Anne Frank and Her Diary |url=http://history1900s.about.com/od/annefrank/a/5AnneFrank.htm |accessdate=April 27, 2014 |newspaper=[[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that these names were taken from characters found in a series of popular Dutch books written by [[Cissy van Marxveldt]].&lt;ref name=about.com /&gt;

Anne's already budding literary ambitions were galvanized on 29 March 1944 when she heard a London radio broadcast made by the exiled Dutch Minister for Education, Art, and Science, [[Gerrit Bolkestein]],&lt;ref name=DefEdition/&gt; calling for the preservation of "ordinary documents—a diary, letters ... simple everyday material" to create an archive for posterity as testimony to the suffering of civilians during the Nazi occupation. On May 20, 1944, she notes that she started re-drafting her diary with future readers in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Different Versions of Anne's Diary |url=http://www.annefrank.org/en/Anne-Frank/The-diary-of-Anne-Frank/The-different-versions-of-Annes-diary/ |website=Anne Frank House |accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She expanded entries and standardized them by addressing all of them to Kitty, clarified situations, prepared a list of pseudonyms, and cut scenes she thought would be of little interest or too intimate for general consumption. By the time she started the second existing volume, she was writing only to Kitty.

==''Dear Kitty''==
There has been much conjecture about the identity or inspiration of Kitty, who in Anne's revised manuscript is the sole recipient of her letters. In 1996, the critic Sietse van der Hoek wrote that the name referred to Kitty Egyedi, a prewar friend of Anne's. Van der Hoek may have been informed by the publication ''A Tribute to Anne Frank'' (1970), prepared by the Anne Frank Foundation, which assumed a factual basis for the character in its preface by the then-chairman of the Foundation, Henri van Praag, and accentuated this with the inclusion of a group photograph that singles out Anne, Sanne Ledermann, [[Hanneli Goslar]], and Kitty Egyedi. Anne does not mention Kitty Egyedi in any of her writings (in fact, the only other girl mentioned in her diary from the often reproduced photo, other than Goslar and Ledermann, is Mary Bos, whose drawings Anne dreamed about in 1944) and the only comparable example of Anne's writing unposted letters to a real friend are two farewell letters to [[Jacqueline van Maarsen]], from September 1942.&lt;ref name=christian&gt;{{cite news |title=Facts about The Diary of Anne Frank |url=http://www.christianmemorials.com/tributes/anne-frank/default.asp?action=showpage&amp;id=27406&amp;pid=643 |accessdate=April 27, 2014 |newspaper=Christian Memorials}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theodor Holman wrote in reply to Sietse van der Hoek that the diary entry for 28 September 1942 proved conclusively the character's fictional origin.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Jacqueline van Maarsen agreed,{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} but Otto Frank assumed his daughter had her real acquaintance in mind when she wrote to someone of the same name.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} However, Kitty Egyedi said in an interview that she was flattered by the assumption, but doubted the diary was addressed to her:

{{quote|Kitty became so idealized and started to lead her own life in the diary that it ceases to matter who is meant by 'Kitty'.

==Synopsis==
Anne had expressed the desire in the rewritten introduction of her diary for one person that she could call her truest friend, that is, a person to whom she could confide her deepest thoughts and feelings. She observed that she had many "friends" and equally many admirers, but (by her own definition) no true, dear friend with whom she could share her innermost thoughts. She originally thought her girl friend Jacque van Maarsen would be this person, but that was only partially successful. In an early diary passage, she remarks that she is not in love with Helmut "Hello" Silberberg, her suitor at that time, but considered that he might become a true friend. In hiding, she invested much time and effort into her budding romance with Peter van Pels, thinking he might evolve into that one, true friend, but that was eventually a disappointment to her in some ways, also, though she still cared for him very much. Ultimately, it was only to Kitty that she entrusted her innermost thoughts.

In her diary, Anne wrote of her very close relationship with her father, lack of daughterly love for her mother (with whom she felt she had nothing in common), and admiration for her sister's intelligence and sweet nature. She did not like the others much initially, particularly Auguste van Pels and Fritz Pfeffer (the latter shared her room). She was at first unimpressed by the quiet Peter; she herself was something of a self-admitted chatterbox (a source of irritation to some of the others). As time went on, however, she and Peter became very close, though she remained uncertain in what direction their relationship would develop.

==Editorial history==
There are two versions of the diary written by Anne Frank. She wrote the first version in a designated diary and two notebooks (version A), but rewrote it (version B) in 1944 after hearing on the radio that war-time diaries were to be collected to document the war period. Version B was written on loose paper, and is not identical to Version A, as parts were added and others omitted.&lt;ref name=rechtbank2015/&gt;

The first transcription of Anne's diary was in German, made by Otto Frank for his friends and relatives in [[Switzerland]], who convinced him to send it for publication.&lt;ref name=finding /&gt; The second, a composition of Anne Frank's versions A and B as well as excerpts from her essays became the first draft submitted for publication, with an epilogue written by a family friend explaining the fate of its author. In the spring of 1946, it came to the attention of Dr. Jan Romein and his wife Annie Romein-Verschoor, two Dutch historians. They were so moved by it that Anne Romein made unsuccessful attempts to find a publisher, which led Romein to write an article for the newspaper ''[[Het Parool]]'':&lt;ref name=published&gt;{{cite web |title=Anne Frank's diary is published |url=http://www.annefrank.org/en/Anne-Frank/The-diary-of-Anne-Frank/Anne-Franks-diary-is-published/ |publisher=Anne Frank House |accessdate=April 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This caught the interest of Contact Publishing in Amsterdam, who approached Otto Frank to submit a Dutch draft of the manuscript for their consideration. They offered to publish, but advised Otto Frank that Anne's candor about her emerging sexuality might offend certain conservative quarters, and suggested cuts. Further entries were also deleted. The diary – which was a combination of version A and version B – was published under the name ''Het Achterhuis. Dagbrieven van 14 juni 1942 tot 1 augustus 1944'' (The Secret Annex. Diary Letters from June 14, 1942 to August 1, 1944) on June 25, 1947.&lt;ref name=published /&gt; Otto Frank later discussed this moment, "If she had been here, Anne would have been so proud."&lt;ref name=published /&gt; The book sold well; the 3000 copies of the first edition were soon sold out, and in 1950 a sixth edition was published.

In 1986, a critical edition appeared, incorporating versions A and B, and based on the findings of the Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation into challenges to the diary's authenticity. This was published in three volumes with a total of 714 pages.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman Aaron Enzer, Sandra Solotaroff-Enzer, ''Anne Frank: Reflections on Her Life and Legacy'' (2000), p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publication in English===
In 1950, the Dutch translator [[Rosey E. Pool]] made a first translation of the Diary, which was never published.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Ann Lee, ''The Hidden Life of Otto Frank'' (London: Penguin, 2003), p. 191-192&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1950, another translator was found to produce an English-language version. Barbara Mooyaart-Doubleday was contracted by Vallentine, Mitchell &amp; Co. in England, and by the end of the following year, her translation was submitted, now including the deleted passages at Otto Frank's request. As well, [[Judith Jones]], while working for the publisher [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], read and recommended the Diary, pulling it out of the rejection pile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Tenth-Muse/Judith-Jones/e/9780307498250|title=The Tenth Muse: My Life in Food|first=Barnes &amp;|last=Noble|website=Barnes &amp; Noble}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones recalled that she came across Frank's work in a slush pile of material that had been rejected by other publishers; she was struck by a photograph of the girl on the cover of an advance copy of the French edition. "I read it all day", she noted. "When my boss returned, I told him, 'We have to publish this book.' He said, 'What? That book by that kid?'" She brought the diary to the attention of Doubleday's New York office. "I made the book quite important because I was so taken with it, and I felt it would have a real market in America. It's one of those seminal books that will never be forgotten", Jones said.&lt;ref name="Tabachnick 2009"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thejewishchronicle.net/bookmark/2225171-The-editor-who-didn%E2%80%99t-pass-on-Anne-Frank-Jones-recalls-famous-diary|title=The editor who didn't pass on Anne Frank; Jones recalls famous diary|last=Tabachnick|first=Toby|date=2009|work=The Jewish Chronicle|access-date=April 2, 2016|via=Firefox|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426203752/http://thejewishchronicle.net/bookmark/2225171-The-editor-who-didn%E2%80%99t-pass-on-Anne-Frank-Jones-recalls-famous-diary|archivedate=April 26, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book appeared in the United States and in th United Kingdom in 1952, becoming a best-seller. The introduction to the English publication was written by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].

In 1989, an English edition of this appeared under the title of ''The Diary of Anne Frank: The Revised Critical Edition'', including Mooyaart-Doubleday's translation and Anne Frank's versions A and B, based on the Dutch critical version of 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Betty Merti, ''The World of Anne Frank: A Complete Resource Guide'' (1998), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Anne, and Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation (2003) [1989]. ''The Diary of Anne Frank: The Revised Critical Edition''. Doubleday. {{ISBN|978-0-385-50847-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A new translation by Susan Massotty, based on the original texts, was published in 1995.

===Theatrical and film adaptations===
A play by [[Albert Hackett]] and [[Frances Goodrich]] based on the diary won the Pulitzer Prize for 1955. A subsequent film version earned [[Shelley Winters]] an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for her performance. Winters donated her Oscar to the [[Anne Frank House]] in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shelley Winters wins the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Mrs van Pels in "The Diary of Anne Frank". |url=http://www.annefrank.org/en/subsites/timeline/postwar-period-1945--present-day/saved-from-demolition/1960/shelley-winters-wins-the-oscar-for-best-supporting-actress-for-her-role-as-mrs-van-pels-in-the-diary-of-anne-frank-/#!/en/subsites/timeline/postwar-period-1945--present-day/saved-from-demolition/1960/shelley-winters-wins-the-oscar-for-best-supporting-actress-for-her-role-as-mrs-van-pels-in-the-diary-of-anne-frank-/ |accessdate=April 27, 2014 |newspaper=Anne Frank House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:'ANNE' stage set.jpg|thumb|Stage set for the 2014 theatre production ''[[Anne (play)|Anne]]'' at Theater Amsterdam, with the Secret Annex re-constructed on the right.]]

The first major adaptation to quote literal passages from the diary was 2014's [[Anne (play)|''Anne'']], authorised and initiated by the Anne Frank Foundation in Basel. After a two-year continuous run at the purpose-built Theater Amsterdam in the Netherlands, the play had productions in Germany&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anne celebrated its premiere in Hamburg |url=https://www.annefrank.ch/234/items/anne-celebrated-its-premiere-in-hamburg.html |website=Anne Frank Foundation |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Israel.

Other adaptations of the diary include a version by [[Wendy Kesselman]] from 1997,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.samuelfrench.com/p/7449/diary-of-anne-frank-the-adaptation-by-wendy-kesselman&lt;/ref&gt;. Alix Sobler's 2014 ''The Secret Annex''  imagined the fate of the diary in a world in which Anne Frank survives the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/the-secret-annex-brings-a-complex-anne-frank-to-life-at-rmtc-1.2546282&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first German film version of the diary, written by [[Fred Breinersdorfer]], was released by [[NBCUniversal]] in 2016. The film is derived from the 2014 Dutch [[Anne (play)|stage production]].

===New editions===
In May 2018, Frank van Vree, the director of the Niod Institute along with others, discovered some unseen excerpts from the diary that Anne had previously covered up with a piece of brown paper. The excerpts discuss sexuality, prostitution, and also include jokes Anne herself described as "dirty" that she heard from the other residents of the [[Anne Frank House|Secret Annex]] and elsewhere. Van Vree said "anyone who reads the passages that have now been discovered will be unable to suppress a smile", before adding, "the 'dirty' jokes are classics among growing children. They make it clear that Anne, with all her gifts, was above all an ordinary girl".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-44133453&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:The Diary of a Young Girl at the Anne Frank Zentrum.jpg|thumb|[[Facsimile]] of the diary of Anne Frank on display at the [[Anne Frank Zentrum]] in [[Berlin]], Germany]]
In the 1960s, Otto Frank recalled his feelings when reading the diary for the first time, "For me, it was a revelation. There, was revealed a completely different Anne to the child that I had lost. I had no idea of the depths of her thoughts and feelings."&lt;ref name=finding&gt;{{cite news |last=Noonan |first=John |title=On This Day: Anne Frank's Diary Published |url=http://www.findingdulcinea.com/news/on-this-day/May-June-08/On-this-Day--Anne-Frank-s-Diary-Published-for-the-First-Time.html |accessdate=April 27, 2014 |newspaper=Finding Dulcinea |date=June 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Berenbaum, former director of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], wrote, "Precocious in style and insight, it traces her emotional growth amid adversity. In it, she wrote, 'In spite of everything, I still believe that people are really good at heart.'"&lt;ref name=finding /&gt;

In 2009, the notebooks of the diary were submitted by the Netherlands and included in UNESCO's [[Memory of the World]] Register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |website=Memory of the World| title=Diaries of Anne Frank|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-2/diaries-of-anne-frank/|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vandalism===
It was reported around the world that in February 2014, 265 copies of the Frank diary and other material related to [[the Holocaust]] were found to be vandalized in 31 public libraries in Tokyo, Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/22/world/asia/diary-of-anne-frank-vandalized-at-japanese-libraries.html?_r=0 |last=Fackler |first=Martin |publisher=The New York Times |title='Diary of Anne Frank' Vandalized at Japanese Libraries |date=February 21, 2014 |accessdate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/21/world/asia/japan-anne-frank-diary-vandalized/ |last=Mullen |first=Jethro |publisher=[[CNN]] |title=Pages torn from scores of copies of Anne Frank's diary in Tokyo libraries |date=February 21, 2014 |accessdate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] expressed "its shock and deep concern"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nlnet/content.aspx?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=8776547&amp;ct=13663333 |title=Wiesenthal Center Expresses Shock and Deep Concern Over Mass Desecrations of The Diary of Anne Frank in Japanese Libraries |date=February 20, 2014 |accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in response, Chief Cabinet Secretary [[Yoshihide Suga]] called the vandalism "shameful."

===Bans===
In 2009, the armed group [[Hezbollah]] called to ban the book in Lebanese schools, arguing that the text was an apology to Jews, Zionism and the State of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3801302,00.html|title=Anne Frank diary offends Lebanon's Hezbollah|date=2009-06-11|work=Ynetnews|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Culpeper County, Virginia]] school system banned the 50th Anniversary "Definitive Edition" of ''Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl'', due to "complaints about its sexual content and homosexual themes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Neverending Campaign to Ban 'Slaughterhouse Five' |publisher=The Atlantic |date=August 12, 2011 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/08/the-neverending-campaign-to-ban-slaughterhouse-five/243525/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version "includes passages previously excluded from the widely read original edition....

In 2013, a similar controversy arose in a 7th grade setting in [[Northville, Michigan]], focusing on explicit passages about sexuality.&lt;ref name="northville-wjbk"&gt;{{cite news

When you're standing up, all you see from the front is hair. Between your legs there are two soft, cushiony things, also covered with hair, which press together when you're standing, so you can't see what's inside. They separate when you sit down and they're very red and quite fleshy on the inside. In the upper part, between the outer labia, there's a fold of skin that, on second thought, looks like a kind of blister. That's the clitoris.'

The [[American Library Association]] stated that there have been six challenges to the book in the United States since it started keeping records on bans and challenges in 1990, and "Most of the concerns were about sexually explicit material".&lt;ref name="WPost"/&gt;

==Authenticity==
As reported in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2015, "When Otto Frank first published his daughter's red-checked diary and notebooks, he wrote a prologue assuring readers that the book mostly contained her words".&lt;ref name=carvajal&gt;Doreen Carvajal, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/14/books/anne-frank-has-a-co-as-diary-gains-co-author-in-legal-move.html?_r=0 Anne Frank's Diary Gains 'Co-Author' in Copyright Move] dated November 13, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Although many [[Holocaust deniers]], such as [[Robert Faurisson]], have claimed that Anne Frank's diary was [[lie#Fabrication|fabricated]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|authorlink=|year=2000|month=|title=The nature of Holocaust denial: What is Holocaust denial?|journal=JPR report|volume=3|issue=|pages=|url=http://www.jpr.org.uk/Reports/CS_Reports/no_3_2000/index.htm|accessdate=|quote=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718044959/http://www.jpr.org.uk/Reports/CS_Reports/no_3_2000/index.htm|archivedate=2011-07-18|df=}}; {{cite book |last=Prose |first=Francine |title=Anne Frank: The Book, The Life, The Afterlife |location=New York |publisher=Harper |year=2009 |pages=239–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Faurisson |first=Robert |authorlink= |year=1982 |month= |title=Is The Diary of Anne Frank genuine? |journal=The Journal of Historical Review |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=147 |url=http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v03/v03p147_Faurisson.html |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; critical and forensic studies of the text and the original [[manuscript]] have supported its authenticity.&lt;ref name="MitgangNYT"&gt;{{Citation |first=Herbert |last=Mitgang |title=An Authenticated Edition of Anne Frank's Diary |date=June 8, 1989 |publisher=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/08/books/an-authenticated-edition-of-anne-frank-s-diary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Netherlands Institute for War Documentation]] commissioned a forensic study of the manuscripts after the death of Otto Frank in 1980. The material composition of the original notebooks and ink, and the handwriting found within them and the loose version were extensively examined. In 1986, the results were published: The handwriting attributed to Anne Frank was positively matched with contemporary samples of Anne Frank's handwriting, and the paper, ink, and glue found in the diaries and loose papers were consistent with materials available in Amsterdam during the period in which the diary was written.&lt;ref name="MitgangNYT" /&gt;

The survey of her manuscripts compared an unabridged transcription of Anne Frank's original notebooks with the entries she expanded and clarified on loose paper in a rewritten form and the final edit as it was prepared for the English translation. The investigation revealed that all of the entries in the published version were accurate transcriptions of manuscript entries in Anne Frank's handwriting, and that they represented approximately a third of the material collected for the initial publication. The magnitude of edits to the text is comparable to other historical diaries such as those of [[Katherine Mansfield]], [[Anaïs Nin]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] in that the authors revised their diaries after the initial draft, and the material was posthumously edited into a publishable manuscript by their respective executors, only to be superseded in later decades by unexpurgated editions prepared by scholars.&lt;ref name="LeeGuardian"&gt;{{Citation |first=Hermione|last=Lee |title=The Journal of Katherine Mansfield |date=December 2, 2006 |publisher=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/dec/02/featuresreviews.guardianreview3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright and ownership of the originals==

===Anne Frank Fonds===

In his will, Otto Frank bequeathed the original manuscripts to the Netherlands Institute for War Documentation. The copyright however belongs to the Anne Frank Fonds, a Switzerland-based foundation of [[Basel]] which was the sole inheritor of Frank after his death in 1980.

===Expiration===
According to the copyright laws in the European Union, as a general rule, rights of authors end seventy years after their death. Hence, the copyright of the diary expired on 1 January 2016. In the Netherlands, for the original publication of 1947 (containing parts of both versions of Anne Frank's writing), as well as a version published in 1986 (containing both versions completely), copyright initially would have expired not 50 years after the death of Anne Frank (1996), but 50 years after publication, as a result of a provision specific for [[wikt:posthumous|posthumously]] published works (1997 and 2036, respectively).

When the copyright duration was extended to 70 years in 1995 – implementing the EU [[Copyright Term Directive]] – the special rule regarding posthumous works was abolished, but transitional provisions made sure that this could never lead to shortening of the copyright term, thus leading to expiration of the copyright term for the first version on 1 January 2016, but for the new material published in 1986 in 2036.&lt;ref name=avenant/&gt;&lt;ref name=rechtbank2015&gt;Court of Amsterdam, 23 December 2015, {{ECLI|ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2015:9312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Dutch version was made available free online by [[University of Nantes]] lecturer Olivier Ertzscheid and French parliament member Isabelle Attard.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite news |title=Anne Frank's diary published online despite rights dispute, as 70 years since her death passes |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-02/anne-franks-diary-goes-online-despite-rights-dispute/7064328 |accessdate=8 January 2016 |work=ABC |date=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authorship===

In 2015, the Anne Frank Fonds made an announcement, as reported in ''The New York Times'', that the 1947 edition of the diary was co-authored by Otto Frank. According to Yves Kugelmann, a member of the board of the foundation, their expert advice was that Otto had created a new work by editing, merging, and trimming entries from the diary and notebooks and reshaping them into a "kind of collage", which had created a new copyright. Agnès Tricoire, a lawyer specializing in intellectual property rights, responded by warning the foundation to "think very carefully about the consequences". She added "If you follow their arguments, it means that they have lied for years about the fact that it was only written by Anne Frank."&lt;ref name=carvajal/&gt;

The Anne Frank Fonds' claim, however, only referred to the heavily edited 1947 Dutch edition, not to the original diary.

The foundation also relies on the fact that another editor, Mirjam Pressler, had revised the text and added 25 percent more material drawn from the diary for a "definitive edition" in 1991, and Pressler was still alive in 2015, thus creating another long-lasting new copyright.&lt;ref name=carvajal/&gt; The move was seen as an attempt to extend the copyright term. Attard had criticised this action only as a "question of money",&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; and Ertzscheid concurred, stating, "It [the diary] belongs to everyone. And it is up to each to measure its importance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sinha |first1=Sanskrity |title=Anne Frank: Diary of a Young Girl published online amid copyright dispute |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/anne-frank-diary-young-girl-published-online-amid-copyright-dispute-1535672 |accessdate=8 January 2016 |work=International Business Times |date=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Fall of the Rebel Angels'''''  is an oil-on-panel by [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|the Netherlandish Renaissance]] artist [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], painted in 1562. It is currently held and exhibited at the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] in [[Brussels]].

==Description==
Painted in 1562, Bruegel's depiction of this subject is taken from a passage from the [[Book of Revelation]] (12, 2-9)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+12&amp;version=KJV King James Version, 12, 2-9]&lt;/ref&gt; and reveals the artist's profound debt to [[Hieronymous Bosch]], especially in the grotesque figures of the fallen angels, shown as half-human, half-animal monsters. Together with ''[[Dull Gret|Dulle Griet]]'' and ''[[The Triumph of Death]]'', which have similar dimensions, it was probably painted for the same collector and destined to become part of a series.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Pietro Allegretti. ''Brueghel''. Milan:Skira, 2003. {{ISBN|0-00-001088-X}} {{it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition with a central figure placed among many smaller figures was favoured by Bruegel at this time, not only in other paintings such as ''Dulle Griet'', but also in the series of engravings of the Vices and the Virtues which he had just completed for the [[Antwerp]] publisher [[Hieronymous Cock]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare Bruegel's engravings ''[[:Commons:File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Superbia (Pride) - WGA3539.jpg|Pride]]'' and ''[[:Commons:File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Gula (Gluttony) - WGA3541.jpg|Gluttony]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[archangel]] [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and his angels are shown by Bruegel in the act of driving the rebel angels from Heaven. [[Pride]] was the sin which caused the fall of [[Lucifer]] and his companions, and the conflict of good and evil, vice and virtue, is a theme which recurs constantly in Bruegel's work.&lt;ref&gt;Max Seidel, Roger H. Marijnissen. ''Bruegel''. Pt.2, Random House, 1985.

'''''The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last berth to be broken up, 1838''''' is an [[oil painting]] by the English artist [[Joseph Mallord William Turner]]. It was painted in 1838 and exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1839.&lt;ref name="Willis266"&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis |title=The Fighting Temeraire |page=266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 98-gun ship [[HMS Temeraire (1798)|HMS ''Temeraire'']] was one of the last [[second-rate]] [[ship of the line|ships of the line]] to have played a distinguished role in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. The painting depicts HMS ''Temeraire'' being towed by a paddle-wheel steam tug towards its final berth in [[Rotherhithe]] in south-east London in 1838 to be broken up for scrap. The painting hangs in the [[National Gallery]], London, having been bequeathed to the nation by the artist in 1851. In 2005 it was [[Greatest Painting in Britain Vote|voted the nation's favourite painting]] in a poll organised by [[BBC Radio 4]]'s [[Today (BBC Radio 4)|''Today'' programme]].&lt;ref name="Willis268"&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis |title=The Fighting Temeraire |page=268 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
When Turner came to paint this picture he was at the height of his career, having exhibited at the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]], London, for 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/joseph-mallord-william-turner-the-fighting-temeraire |title=''The Fighting Temeraire'' |publisher=[[National Gallery]] |accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was renowned for his highly atmospheric paintings in which he explored the subjects of the weather, the sea and the effects of light. He spent much of his life near the River Thames and did many paintings of ships and waterside scenes, both in watercolour and in oils.  Turner frequently made small sketches and then worked them into finished paintings in the studio.

He may or may not have witnessed the actual towing of ''Temeraire'' and used considerable licence in the painting which had a symbolic meaning for him, that his first audience immediately appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 310–314&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moyle, 383&lt;/ref&gt; Turner had been eighteen years old when Britain entered the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and "had a strong patriotic streak".  The ''Temeraire'' was a very well-known ship from her heroic performance at Trafalgar, and her sale by the Admiralty had attracted substantial press coverage, which was probably what brought the subject to his attention.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 309–310, 309 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolism ==
[[File:Turner, J. M. W. - The Fighting Téméraire tugged to her last Berth to be broken (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Detail]]
The composition of this painting is unusual in that the most significant object, the old warship, is positioned well to the left of the painting, where it rises in stately splendour and almost ghostlike colours against a triangle of blue sky and rising mist that throws it into relief. The beauty of the old ship is in stark contrast to the dirty blackened [[tugboat]] with its tall [[chimney|smokestack]], which scurries across the still surface of the river.

Turner has used the triangle of blue to frame a second triangle of masted ships, which progressively decrease in size as they become more distant. ''Temeraire'' and tugboat have passed a small river craft with its [[gaff rig]]ged [[sail]] barely catching a breeze. Beyond this a [[square rig|square-rigger]] drifts, with every bit of sail extended. Another small craft shows as a patch of white farther down the river. In the far distance, beyond the second tugboat which makes its way towards them, a three-[[mast (sailing)|mast]]ed ship rides at anchor. The becalmed sailing vessels show the obsolescence of sail.

On the opposite side of the painting to ''Temeraire'', and exactly the same distance from the frame as the ship's main mast, the sun sets above the estuary, its rays extending into the clouds above it, and across the surface of the water. The flaming red of the clouds is reflected in the river. It exactly repeats the colour of the smoke which pours from the funnel of the tugboat. The sun setting symbolises the end of an epoch in the history of the British Royal Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Venning, B (2003) "Turner" p.&amp;nbsp;241&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind ''Temeraire'', a gleaming sliver of the waxing moon casts a silvery beam across the river, symbolising the commencement of the new, industrial era.&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, 326&lt;/ref&gt; The demise of heroic strength is the subject of the painting, and it has been suggested that the ship stands for the artist himself, with an accomplished and glorious past but now contemplating his mortality. Turner called the work his "darling", which may have been due to its beauty, or his identification with the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Wilton, p. 212;  ''citing'' Hawes, pp. 34–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Newbolt|Sir Henry Newbolt]] wrote later a ballad titled ''The Fighting Temeraire'', describing the same scene: "And she's fading down the river, But in England's song for ever, She's the Fighting Téméraire."

== Artistic licence ==
[[File:Turner, J. M. W. - The Fighting Téméraire tugged to her last Berth to be broken (cropped2).jpg|thumb|Detail of bottom right corner]]
Turner took some artistic licence with the painting.  The ship was known to her crew as "Saucy", rather than "Fighting" ''Temeraire''.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |last=Reynolds |first=Nigel |title=Turner's ''Fighting Temeraire'' sinks the opposition |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=6 September 2005 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1497703/Turners-Fighting-Temeraire-sinks-the-opposition.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before being sold to the ship-breaker John Beatson, the ship had been lying at [[Sheerness Dockyard]], and was then moved to his [[wharf]] at [[Rotherhithe]].&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 309&lt;/ref&gt; As shown in a "prosaic drawing, made on the spot by a trained observer" (William Beatson, the ship-breaker's brother) and turned into a [[lithograph]], her masts and rigging were removed before her sale and journey to the breaker's yard.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 309&lt;/ref&gt; All of her cannon, anchors and assorted hardware had been removed and salvaged for the navy to use as spare parts.&lt;ref name="jmwt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 308–309&lt;/ref&gt; She was towed by two tugboats, not just one,&lt;ref&gt;Hawes. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the other direction (the sun sets in the west, while the Thames estuary is at the river's eastern end).&lt;ref&gt;Hawes, noting that: "Also, the locale of the painting may possibly be "Lime House Reach," near Greenwich and Rotherhithe, which runs south for a brief stretch; this is the one area along the Thames where the setting September sun would appear, in actuality, to the right of the ship, albeit considerably farther to the right than in the painting". Hawes, p. 43, footnote 6.  However, since it is unlikely Turner actually saw the journey from any vantage place, the point is moot.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the painting ==
When exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1839 the painting was a considerable success, praised in various of the lengthy press reviews that the Summer Exhibitions then received as a "grand image of the last days of one of Britain's bulwarks" as ''[[The Spectator]]'' put it.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 313, edition of 11 May 1839&lt;/ref&gt; The novelist [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], reviewing for ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'' "in the form of mostly facetious letters" supposedly by "Michael Angelo Titmarsh Esq." abandoned his usual flippant tone when discussing "as grand a picture as ever figured on the walls of any academy, or came from the easel of any painter".&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 313, edition 1839, X for June&lt;/ref&gt; Turner displayed the painting in 1839 accompanied by an altered excerpt from [[Thomas Campbell (poet)|Thomas Campbell]]'s poem ''Ye Mariners of England'', reading:

&lt;poem&gt;
: The flag which braved the battle and the breeze,
: No longer owns her.&lt;ref name="Adkin310"&gt;{{cite book |last=Adkin |title=The Trafalgar Companion |page=310 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Willis274"&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire |page=274 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jmwt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.j-m-w-turner.co.uk/turner-temeraire.htm |publisher=William Turner, Painter of Light j-m-w-turner.co.uk |title=The Fighting Temeraire, tugged to her Last Berth to be broken up, 1838, 91×122 cm National Gallery |accessdate=8 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Turner kept the painting in his studio, which also functioned as a showroom for buyers, until his death. In 1844 he lent it as part of his deal for reproductions to the print publisher J. Hogarth, who exhibited it at his premises, but about a year later wrote a draft note replying to another request saying that "no consid[eratio]ns of money or favour can induce me to lend my Darling again...".  Hogarth's [[steel engraving]] by [[James Tibbits Willmore]], who had often engraved Turners, was published in 1845 and was the first of many reproductions in various techniques.&lt;ref name="Egerton, 306"&gt;Egerton, 306&lt;/ref&gt; In about 1848 Turner refused an offer to buy the painting reputed to have been £5,000, followed by a "blank cheque", having determined to leave it to the nation, and already being very well-off.&lt;ref name="Egerton, 314"&gt;Egerton, 314&lt;/ref&gt;

It was evidently usually among the works on display in the studio, and is mentioned by several visitors.&lt;ref name="Egerton, 314"/&gt; He intended to leave his paintings to the nation but the terms of his will were unclear and after his death in 1851 his will was contested by relatives, and several years of litigation were only ended in 1856, when this and a large body of other work entered the collection of the National Gallery.  Most of the "Turner Bequest" was turned over to [[Tate Britain]] when that was established in 1897, but the ''Fighting Temeraire'' remained in the National Gallery.  It was in the Tate Gallery (as it then was) from 1910 to 1914 and 1960 to 1961, and for six months in 1987 to mark the opening of the Clore Gallery there, which houses the rest of the Bequest.  In 1947–48 it went on a European tour to Amsterdam, [[Bern]], Paris, [[Brussels]], [[Liège]], ending at the [[Venice Biennale]]. In 1952 it was exhibited in [[Cape Town]].&lt;ref name="Egerton, 306"/&gt;

The picture remains in "exceptionally good condition", apart from slightly discoloured [[varnish]], and seems never to have received conservation treatment beyond the removal of surface dirt in 1945 and a lining in 1963. X-ray images reveal that Turner seems to have used a canvas on which he had started another marine picture, with a large sail where the tugboat's above deck structures now are.&lt;ref name="Egerton, 306"/&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The painting is used in the 2012 James Bond film ''[[Skyfall]]'' to be symbolic of Bond's age and current standing within MI6:

Q: "Always makes me feel a little melancholy. Grand old war ship, being ignominiously hauled away for scrap... The inevitability of time, don't you think? What do you see?"

Bond: "A bloody big ship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theartofilm.blogspot.com/2012/11/skyfall-fighting-temeraire.html|title=The Art of Film : Skyfall: The Fighting Temeraire|author=The Art of Film|date=20 November 2012|publisher=Theartofilm.blogspot.com|accessdate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Dissertation Concerning the Nature of True Virtue''''' is a work by American Christian [[Reformed theology|reformer]], [[theologian]], [[author]] and, [[pastor]] [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] originally published posthumously in 1765.&lt;ref name="Jonathan Edwards Center"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edwards.yale.edu/research/major-works/nature-of-true-virtue/|title=The Jonathan Edwards Center at Yale University|accessdate=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was published jointly with ''[[A Dissertation Concerning the End for Which God Created the World]]''.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gwinn|first=Robert P.|title=The New [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|editor=McHenry, Robert|publisher=The [[University of Chicago]]|location=[[Chicago, Illinois]]|year=1993|volume=Four|pages=382|accessdate=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
{{calvinism}}
In ''Virtue'', Edwards describes his views on the different levels of [[virtue]], specifically "common [[morality]]" and "true (saving) virtue."&lt;ref name="Jonathan Edwards Center" /&gt; [[God]], Edwards argues, had in mind as the end for his creation of the world His own [[Glory (religion)|glory]] and not human happiness. Thus, true virtue does not arise from self-love or from any earth-bound selflessness (these were two common views at the time) but from a desire to see God's glory displayed above all. Love of self, family, or nation is good only to the extent that it magnifies the glory of God.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica" /&gt;

==History and impact==
''The Nature of True Virtue'', and its companion work, ''A Dissertation Concerning the End for Which God Created the World'', are still popular works today. Modern [[theologian]] [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]], who extensively studied the works of Edwards while at [[Seminary]], credits the work with awakening in him "a deep longing to be a good man."&lt;ref name="John Piper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/Articles/ByDate/1978/2366_A_Personal_Encounter_with_Jonathan_Edwards/|title=A Personal Encounter with Jonathan Edwards|last=Piper|first=John|date=1978-11-01|work=The Reformed Journal|accessdate=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Law of Conservation of Misery''' is a [[folk wisdom]] that states that the total amount of [[wikt:misery|misery]] in a system is constant.

This implies that when you try to decrease the misery in one aspect of a system, you will increase the misery in some of the other aspects. In other words, for each problem you solve, at least one new problem is created, or as many new problems that together equal the trouble caused by the original problem. This law has particular significance in the realm of fantasy football, where one person's misery appears to correlate inversely with another person's happiness.  &lt;ref&gt;Dealing with Dilemmas, [[Frank Buytendijk]], 2010, Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|0470630310}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hertzfeld|first=Andy|title=Revolution in the valley|year=2005|publisher=O'Reilly|location=Sebastapol, Calif.|isbn=0-596-00719-1|pages=88|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;
