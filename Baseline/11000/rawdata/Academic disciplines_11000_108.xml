      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5101">The '''AL procedure''' is a procedure for [[fair item assignment]] between two people. It finds an [[envy-free item assignment]] of a subset of the items. Moreover, the resulting allocation is [[Pareto efficient]] in the following sense: there is no other envy-free allocation which is better for one person and not worse for the other person.

The AL procedure was first published by Brams and Kilgour and Klamler.&lt;ref name=bkk13&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brams|first1=Steven J.|last2=Kilgour|first2=D. Marc|last3=Klamler|first3=Christian|title=Two-Person Fair Division of Indivisible Items: An Efficient, Envy-Free Algorithm|journal=Notices of the American Mathematical Society|date=1 February 2014|volume=61|issue=2|pages=130|doi=10.1090/noti1075 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was later generalized by Haris Aziz to handle the case where agents may express indifferences.&lt;ref name="h15"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s40505-015-0089-1|title=A generalization of the AL method for fair allocation of indivisible objects|journal=Economic Theory Bulletin|volume=4|issue=2|pages=307|year=2015|last1=Aziz|first1=Haris|arxiv=1409.6765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assumptions ==
The AL procedure requires the following assumptions on the people:
* Each person can rank the items from best to worst (i.e., each person can report a strict [[preference (economics)|preference relation]] on the items).
* Each person has a preference relation on bundles of items which is compatible with the [[responsive set extension]] of the ordering on items.

== Requirements ==
It is ''not'' assumed that the people can report their preference relation on bundles. There are many bundles, and it may be difficult to report a ranking on all of them.

Therefore, the procedure should return an allocation that is envy-free for ''every'' preference relation that is consistent with the item ranking and with weak additivity. In other words, the procedure should return an allocation that is ''necessarily envy-free'' (NEF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite ComSoc Handbook 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|303}}

Suppose the two people are Alice and George. An allocation is ''NEF for Alice'' if there is an injection ''f'' from George's items to Alice's items, such that for each item ''x'' received by George, Alice prefers ''f''(''x'') to ''x''. An allocation is ''NEF for George'' if the symmetric property is satisfied. An item assignment is ''NEF'' if it is NEF for both partners. Note that in a NEF assignment, Alice and George receive the same number of items.

The empty allocation is obviously NEF, but it is very inefficient. Therefore, we are looking for an allocation that is "best" among all NEF allocations. A NEF allocation is called [[Pareto-efficient]] if there is no other NEF allocation that is better for one person and not worse for the other one.

== The BT procedure ==
As an introduction, consider the following simple division procedure:

* Put all items on the table.
* While there are items on the table, do:
** Ask the partners to choose their favorite item from all items on the table.
** If the choices are different, then give each partner his/her favorite item and continue.
** If the choices are identical, then send the chosen item to the Contested Pile. It will not be allocated.

This procedure returns a NEF allocation. It is very simple but not very efficient, since many items are discarded to the contested pile. The AL procedure is slightly more complicated, but it guarantees that the contested pile is never larger, and may be smaller than under BT.

== The AL procedure ==
The AL procedure works similarly to the BT procedure, but, before moving an item to the contested pile, it tries to allocate it to one partner while compensating the other partner with another item. Only if this doesn't succeed, the item is sent to the contested pile.

For example, suppose there are four items (1, 2, 3, 4) and the preferences of the partners are:
* Alice: 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 4
* George: 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 4 &gt; 1

The BT procedure gives 1 to Alice and 2 to George, since these are their favorites and they are different. Then, both Alice and George choose 3 so it is discarded. Then, both choose 4 so it is also discarded. The final allocation is: Alice←{1}, George←{2}. It is NEF but not PE.

The AL procedure also starts by giving 1 to Alice and 2 to George. Then, instead of discarding item 3, it is given to Alice, and George is compensated with item 4. The final allocation is: Alice&amp;nbsp;←&amp;nbsp;{1,3}, George&amp;nbsp;←&amp;nbsp;{2,4}. It is NEF and PE.

Both procedures are manipulable: a partner can gain by reporting incorrect preferences. However, such manipulation requires knowledge of the other partner's preferences, so it is difficult in practice.

== The AL procedure with indifferences ==
The original AL procedure crucially relies on the assumption that the item rankings are strict.

&lt;ref name="h15"/&gt; generalizes this procedure to general rankings, with possible indifferences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26216">'''Abstinence, be faithful, use a condom''',  also known as the '''ABC strategy''' or '''abstinence-plus sex education''', also known as abstinence-based sex education, is a [[sex education]] policy based on a combination of "risk avoidance" and [[harm reduction]] which modifies the approach of [[abstinence-only sex education]] by including education about the value of partner reduction [[safe sex]] and [[birth control]] methods. Abstinence-only sex education is strictly to promote the sexual abstinence until marriage, and does not teach about safe sex or contraceptives. The abstinence-based sex education program is meant to stress abstinence and include information on safe sex practices. In general terms, this strategy of sex education is a compromise between abstinence-only education and comprehensive sex education. The ABC approach was developed in response to the growing epidemic of [[HIV/AIDS in Africa]], and to prevent the spread of other [[sexually transmitted disease]]s. This approach has been credited by some with the falling numbers of those infected with AIDS in Uganda, Kenya and Zimbabwe, among others. From 1990 to 2001 the percentage of Ugandans living with AIDS fell from 15% to between 5 and 6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|year=2005|title=ABC in Uganda: success or subterfuge?|url=|journal=HIV/AIDS Policy&amp;Law Review|volume=10|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Edward C.|last2=Halperin|first2=Daniel T.|last3=Nantulya|first3=Vinand|last4=Hogle|first4=Janice A.|date=2006-05-11|title=Uganda's HIV Prevention Success: The Role of Sexual Behavior Change and the National Response|journal=AIDS and Behavior|language=en|volume=10|issue=4|pages=335–346|doi=10.1007/s10461-006-9073-y|issn=1090-7165|pmc=1544373|pmid=16688475}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fall is believed to result from the employment of the ABC approach, especially reduction in the number of sex partners, called "Zero-Grazing" in Uganda.

Abstinence-based sex education can include issues of human relationships, the basic biology of human reproduction, safe sex methods and contraceptives, [[HIV/AIDS]] information, and masturbation in place of sex. It recommends [[sexual abstinence]] outside marriage as an ideal, having only a single long-term sexual partner. The use of [[condom]]s and other safe sex practices is advocated only if it is not possible to remain with a single sexual partner. Advocating this ideal, whilst pragmatically dealing with the fact that abstinence only sex education is ineffective by itself, has made the ABC approach popular with many African governments and relief agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Green |first=Edward C.|title=Rethinking AIDS Prevention|type=book |publisher=Preager|year=2003 |oclc=612065556|isbn=978-0865693166}}{{Page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ABC approach has notably been used in African countries. Versions of this approach have been used for [[abstinence-only sex education in Uganda]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The ABC of HIV prevention |publisher=[[AVERT]] |url=http://www.avert.org/abc-hiv.htm|date=2015-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its positive impact has been confirmed by a 2009 Stanford University survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Eran |last1=Bendavid |first2=Jayanta |last2=Bhattacharya |title=The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in Africa: An Evaluation of Outcomes |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |pmid=19349625 |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19349625 |laysummary=http://healthpolicy.stanford.edu/news/stanford_study_first_ever_to_show_us_aids_relief_program_saved_a_million_lives_20090406/ |laysource=[[Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies]] |laydate=April 6, 2009 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-150-10-200905190-00117 |year=2009 |volume=150 |issue=10 |pages=688–95 |pmc=2892894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==
Abstinence, be faithful, use a Condom consists of three components:
*'''Abstinence''': The ABC approach encourages young adults to delay "sexual debut" (age of first sexual intercourse), or to use abstinence until marriage, the most effective way to avoid HIV infection, as advocated as the ideal by Christianity.  The program develops skills for practicing abstinence and encourages participants to adopt social norms that support abstinence.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}  
*'''Be Faithful''': In addition to abstinence, the ABC approach encourages participants to eliminate casual or other concurrent sex partners and to practice fidelity within their marriages and other sexual relationships.  This reduces exposure to HIV..{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* '''Use a Condom''': The Catholic Church has publicly stated its opposition to condom use. However, in 2010, during an interview, Pope Benedict XVI addressed the use of condoms and his view that condoms are the "first step" of morality&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bengiano|first=Giuseppe|last2=Carrara|first2=Sabina|last3=Filipi|first3=Valentina|last4=Brosens|first4=Ivo|year=2011|title=Condoms, HIV and the Roman Catholic Church|url=|journal=Reproductive Biomedicine Online|volume=22|pages=701–709|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
Starting primarily in the 1980s and 1990s, the popularity of the "abstinence plus" sex education program grew into a common method of teaching students, in the [[United States]], about sexuality. The program understood that it would not be possible to stop all teenagers from having sex, but still stressed that abstinence is the only guaranteed way of avoiding unwanted pregnancies and contraction of STDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ashbee |first=Edward |title=The Bush Administration, Sex and the Moral Agenda |location=New York |publisher=Manchester UP |year=2007 |pages=102–36 |isbn=978-0-7190-7277-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important message to teens from the program comes from [[Joycelyn Elders]], [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton's]] first [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]], that "if they have a baby there is an 80% likelihood they'll be poor, ignorant, and slaves for the rest of their lives."&lt;ref&gt;"Illegitimate rhetoric- Clinton administration's policies towards sex education", ''National Review'' (15 August 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] established a "Girl Power!" campaign focusing on girls ages 9–14 which encouraged abstinence as a form of empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE NATIONAL STRATEGY TO PREVENT OUT-OF-WEDLOCK TEEN PREGNANCIES|url=http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/teenp/strategy.htm|work=aspe.hhs.gov|accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those who would reject abstinence, or have early sex forced upon them, abstinence-only messages provided little to no hope to prevent pregnancy and spread of disease. To account for this, some states included information about contraceptives in their sex education programs along with encouragement for students to be abstinent. Of the states that, in 1995, required abstinence education, fourteen also included the use of contraception within the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=327–39 |doi=10.1016/S0190-7409(97)00021-2 |title=Sex Education and Abstinence: Programs and Evaluation |year=1997 |last1=Besharov |first1=Douglas J. |last2=Gardiner |first2=Karen N. |journal=Children and Youth Services Review |volume=19 |issue=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1995, [[Hawaii]] passed the Abstinence-Based Education Policy. (Policy # 2110). It is meant to support abstinence and help develop skills to continue abstinence, help teens who have had sexual intercourse to abstain from further, and to provide teens with information on contraceptives and methods for preventing sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lilinote.k12.hi.us/STATE/BOE/POL1.NSF/85255a0a0010ae82852555340060479d/1bb88fd5ec2ea5940a2566a3000110ef?OpenDocument|title=Abstinence-Based Education Policy|publisher=Hawaii State Government|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the federal government increased funding for state abstinence education as an inclusion of the Welfare Reform Act, creating Title V, and the abstinence-only-until-marriage program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carr|first=Jillian B.|last2=Packham|first2=Analisa|year=2016|title=The Effects of State-Mandated Abstinence-Based Sex Education on Teen Health Outcomes|url=|journal=Health Economics|volume=26|issue=4|pages=403–420|doi=10.1002/hec.3315|pmid=26918400|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in abstinence funding created incentives for states to maintain these rulings, which over 20 states have.

In 2006 and 2007, $176 million was given annually to abstinence-only programs, whose central message was to delay sexual activity until marriage, preventing the inclusion of information about safe-sex practices or contraception.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanger-Hall|first=Kathrin F.|last2=Hall|first2=David W.|year=2011|title=Abstinence-Only Education and Teen Pregnancy Rates: Why We Need Comprehensive Sex Education in the U.S.|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=6|issue=10|pages=e24658|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0024658|via=|pmid=22022362|pmc=3194801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 2009, funding was cut off for abstinence-only education programs, with no further fund allocated in the 2010 FY budget, and the push for evidence-based sex education and teen pregnancy prevention programs. However, on September 29, 2009 funding was restored to abstinence-only programs, as well as leaving the decision of what sex education program would be taught in public schools up to the individual states&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The state of Texas, where the law states that comprehensive sex education is allowed to be taught, but 94% of school districts have been reported to use abstinence-only sex education, developed an abstinence-plus sex education program called ''Big Decisions'', which not only emphasized abstinence to high school students, but integrated education about condom use and contraception, contradicting the majority of the school districts' decisions to maintain an abstinence-only education program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Realini|first=Janet P.|last2=Buzi|first2=Ruth S.|last3=Smith|first3=Peggy B.|last4=Martinez|first4=Mario|year=2010|title=Evaluation of "Big Decisions": An Abstinence-Plus Sexuality Curriculum|url=|journal=Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy|volume=36|issue=4|pages=313–326|via=|doi=10.1080/0092623x.2010.488113|pmid=20574887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Africa ==

=== Uganda ===
Uganda has been touted as the success story of the ABC strategy, with a significant reduction of HIV/AIDS infection rates and a push towards sexual behavior change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This shift in sexual behavior began in the mid 1980s, when AIDS was a global disease, resulting in the reduction of multiple sexual partners for an individual, and the increase of condom use&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parkhurst|first=Justin O.|year=2010|title=Evidence, politics and Uganda's HIV success: Moving forward with ABC and HIV prevention|url=|journal=Journal of International Development|volume=23|issue=2|pages=240–252|doi=10.1002/jid.1667|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However,  there is debate over whether the ABC strategy was the sole factor that contributed to the decline in HIV/AIDS infection. There has also been debate and discourse over the emphasis of one tenet of ABC sex education over the other. Currently there is the debate over the emphasis of "A" over "C" and vis versa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Uganda's HIV/AIDS and sex education program has a greater focus on the use of condoms in preventing HIV/AIDS, however, religious institutions emphasize abstinence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The success of the ABC strategy in sex education is in part due to the fact that the branches of this strategy are "proximate determinants of HIV infection", also known as ways of reducing or even avoiding the risk of infection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Malawi ===
Like Uganda, there is a push to change the sexual behaviors, however, this message is being emphasized by religious leaders rather than state officials.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trinitapoli|first=Jenny|year=2009|title=Religious teachings and influences on the ABCs of HIV prevention in Malawi|url=|journal=Social Science and Medicine|volume=69|issue=2|pages=199–209|via=|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.04.018|pmid=19447536}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three tenets of ABC are broken down in Malawi into groups. Abstinence is emphasized for individuals who are young and unmarried, who hear messages about AIDS regularly; Be faithful is emphasized with married couples whose religious leader "polices" their sexual behavior; Condom use is a contested area with religious leaders due to the fact that religious openly denounce condom use, however some leaders have privately consulted individuals on condom use, resulting in many members doing so.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, religious leaders do not comment on the risks and issues of AIDS, which can potentially put an entire congregation at risk.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Religious and Ideological Influences ==
Many communities that have adopted the ABC strategy of sex education have used this strategy of sex education in congruence with religious or ideological influences. In Malawi, religious leaders influence and emphasize the use  this strategy&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

However, in the United States, ideologies influence the use of ABC strategy. In this case, political ideologies influence the use of various sex education programs. For example, conservatism had previously taught young women that sex was about danger, not pleasure, focusing on an abstinence-only education program, reinforcing the foundational conservative ideas  of fear, and that society is fragile and human nature is inherently bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Citizen's Guide to American Ideology|last=Marietta|first=Morgan|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=14–17|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Sex Goes to School|last=Luker|first=Kristin|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2006|isbn=|location=New York|pages=130|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political ideologies have long been influences in the debate over sex education programs, pushing political agendas.

Globally, the debate of sex education divides liberals and conservatives. In many countries, children do not receive proper sex education, and discourage the act of sex itself&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmerman|first=Jonathan|year=2014|title=Sex education is a global dividing line between liberals and conservatives|url=|journal=The Washington Post|volume=|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responses ==
The usefulness of the ABC approach is highly debated. The three elements are interpreted differently by different actors and critics argue that often abstinence and faithfulness are unduly promoted over condoms and other measures such as education, female empowerment and making available modern antiviral drugs.&lt;ref name=Barnett&gt;{{cite journal |pages=590–3 |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(05)70219-X |title=HIV/AIDS: Sex, abstinence, and behaviour change |year=2005 |last1=Barnett |first1=Tony |last2=Parkhurst |first2=Justin |journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases |volume=5 |issue=9 |pmid=16122682}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[United States|U.S.]] [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] under President George W Bush has been criticized for seeming to prioritize "A" and "B" over "C" within its funding criteria. "C" activities may only be directed at "high-risk" groups, and not to the general population.&lt;ref&gt;United States Government Accountability Office, 2006; Cohen J. Tate T. 2005.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, donor funding has always been allocated overwhelmingly to condoms, reflecting clear US and European policy priorities, including under George W Bush.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Criticisms ===
Critics argue that in many countries women are frequently infected by their unfaithful husbands while being faithfully married, and thus women who follow the recommendations of ABC promoters face an increased risk of HIV infection.&lt;ref name=Sinding&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Steven W. |last1=Sinding |title=Does 'CNN' (Condoms, Needles, Negotiation) Work Better than 'ABC' (Abstinence, Being Faithful and Condom Use) in Attacking the AIDS Epidemic? |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |jstor=3649501 |pmid=15888408 |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3103805.html |pages=38–40 |volume=31 |issue=1 |year=2005 |doi=10.1363/ifpp.31.38.05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Condoms, needles, and negotiation]] is a proposed alternative approach  as is ''SAVE'' (Safer practices, Available medication, Voluntary testing &amp; counseling and Empowerment through education).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anerela.org/prevention-model.html |title=de beste bron van informatie over anerela. Deze website is te koop! |publisher=anerela.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics furthermore allege that the strategy overlooks the epidemic's social, political, and economic causes and "vulnerable populations", e.g. [[sex worker]]s and "those who lack the ability to negotiate safe sex" as well as risk groups such as [[homosexual]]s and [[intravenous drug user]]s. However, most infections in Africa occur outside these vulnerable groups, and ABC  was a US donor policy only for the "generalized" epidemics in Africa. Murphy et al. found that Uganda's ABC approach empowered  women. "Remarkably, in the 2000–2001 Uganda DHS, 91 percent of women said they could refuse sex with their husbands if they knew their husbands had STIs, a somewhat higher percentage than in several other African countries" &lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030379 |title=Was the "ABC" Approach (Abstinence, Being Faithful, Using Condoms) Responsible for Uganda's Decline in HIV? |year=2006 |last1=Murphy |first1=Elaine M. |last2=Greene |first2=Margaret E. |last3=Mihailovic |first3=Alexandra |last4=Olupot-Olupot |first4=Peter |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=e379 |pmid=17002505 |pmc=1564179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics also argue that using the word "abstinence," then teaching about safe sex and contraceptives, can be contradictory.&lt;ref name="HRW"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Jonathan |last1=Cohen |first2=Tony |last2=Tate |title=The Less They Know, the Better: Abstinence-Only HIV/AIDS Programs in Uganda |journal=Reproductive Health Matters |jstor=25475267 |pmid=18446994 |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2005/uganda0305/index.htm |pages=174–178 |volume=14 |issue=28 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/S0968-8080(06)28249-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the argument of the gendered presentation of ABC success stories.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Shari L.|last2=Ehrhardt|first2=Anke A.|year=2007|title=Going Beyond "ABC" to Include "GEM": Critical Reflections on Progress in the HIV/AIDS Epidemic|url=|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=97|issue=1|pages=13–18|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2005.074591|pmid=17138923|via=|pmc=1716252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has indicated that the power roles in which men and women fall in the gender dynamic of relationships, as well as sexual double standards, sexual violence, and harmful cultural practices affect a greater number of women when trying to implement HIV/AIDS prevention through individual decision making.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Critiques of geographic location are also relevant in the success of ABC success. Migration patterns within a population affect both men and women where men who migrate are more likely to contract the infection and bring it back and infect their female partner, whose greatest risk of contracting HIV is from their husbands extramarital sexual encounters, but women are also seen contracting the disease outside of their primary relationship, focusing the ABC strategy on morality and "static individualized behavior".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parikh|first=Shanti A.|year=2007|title=The Political Economy of Marriage and HIV: The ABC Approach, "Safe" Infidelity, and Managing Moral Risk in Uganda|url=|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=97|issue=7|pages=1198–1208|via=|doi=10.2105/ajph.2006.088682|pmid=17538057|pmc=1913085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debate in the U.S. ===
How sex education should be taught in public schools in the United States has been a topic for debate since the sexual revolution.  A majority of the debate is focused on whether or not there should be a comprehensive sex education program or an abstinence-only program.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Abstinence-only sex education programs have been proven to be ineffective and there is little evidence showing that abstinence-only, or abstinence-only-until-marriage programs lower [[risky sexual behavior]] in teens&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Kelly L.|last2=Lee Smith|first2=Matthew|last3=Rosen|first3=Brittany L.|last4=Wiley|first4=David C.|year=2012|title=Adoption and implementation characteristics for abstinence-plus curriculum|url=|journal=American Journal of Health|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence to support a parental push for earlier sex education for students, starting in elementary school rather than middle school. Along with the push for earlier sex education, there is the call for age-appropriate sex education. This means that for elementary school students, the sex education they receive will be tailored to their age. A study conducted in 2013 found that parents who pushed for earlier sex education settled on the sex education elementary school students receive will be 89% communication skills, 65% human anatomy/reproductive information, 61% abstinence, 53% HIV/STD infection information, and 52% gender/sexual orientation issues.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barr|first=Elissa M.|last2=Moore|first2=Michelle J.|last3=Johnson|first3=Tammie|last4=Forrest|first4=Jamie|last5=Jordan|first5=Melissa|year=2014|title=New Evidence: Data Documenting Parental Support for Earlier Sexuality Education Authors|url=|journal=Journal of School Health|volume=84|issue=1|pages=10–17|doi=10.1111/josh.12112|via=|pmid=24320147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents in this study also supported a greater emphasis on sex education in middle schools and an increase in the teaching of the same topics from elementary school as well as a greater emphasis on birth control and condom use&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Commentators===
[[Pope]] [[Benedict XVI]] has criticized some harm reduction policies with regards to HIV/AIDS, saying that "if the soul is lacking, if Africans do not help one another, the scourge [of HIV] cannot be resolved by distributing condoms; quite the contrary, we risk worsening the problem".{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} Whilst this position has been widely denounced for misrepresenting and oversimplifying the role of condoms in preventing infections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Yankee |last1=Doodling |title=The papal position on condoms and HIV |journal=BMJ |pmid=19321547 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19321547 |doi=10.1136/bmj.b1217 |year=2009 |volume=338 |pages=b1217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.b1206 |title=Pope claims that condoms exacerbate HIV and AIDS problem |year=2009 |last1=Roehr |first1=B. |journal=BMJ |volume=338 |pages=b1206 |pmid=19321545}}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been expert scientific opinion and evidence supporting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Pope May Be Right |first=Edward C. |last=Green |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/27/AR2009032702825.html |work=The Washington Post |date=29 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Archbishop Gabriel Charles Palmer-Buckle of Accra has stated that "the Catholic Church [offers] three methods to help solve this problem of AIDS in Africa: "A", abstain; "B", be faithful; "C", chastity, which is in consonance with traditional African values. Those [[Planned Parenthood]] people are only talking about condoms. By the way, they know full well that the condoms devoted to Africa are sub-standard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ncronline.org/news/vatican/ghanaian-archbishop-says-church-has-failed-africa |title=Ghanaian archbishop says church has failed Africa |date=October 14, 2009 |first=John L. |last=Allen |work=National Catholic Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are [[Fear, uncertainty and doubt|no reliable sources]] that condoms distributed in Africa are inferior to those elsewhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12294480 |year=1999 |title=South Africa plays down faulty condom scare |pages=10–1 |journal=AIDS Weekly Plus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major proponent of the ABC approach, author and member of Presidential Advisory Council on HIV and Aids in 2003-2007, Harvard University's Edward C Green, stated “Advocates of the ABCs often use the term to mean a primary emphasis on abstinence/delay of sexual debut and faithfulness/partner reduction, with condom use being a secondary but necessary strategy for those who do not or cannot practice abstinence or fidelity." Furthermore, Green in his seminal book Rethinking AIDS Prevention (Praeger 2003) argued  that the success in Uganda, where prevalence feel 21% to 6% between 1989-2003 was largely due to the "B" of the ABC approach, fidelity or reduction in multiple partners. This conclusion was validated and expanded to underscore the dangers of concurrent sexual partners by Helen Epstein, in The Invisible Cure &lt;ref&gt;{The Invisible Cure: Africa, the West, and the Fight Against AIDS. Farrar, Straus and Giroux 2007 |&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Analytical feminism''' is  a line of philosophy that applies analytic concepts and methods to feminist issues and applies feminist concepts and insights to issues that have traditionally been of interest to analytic philosophers. Like all [[Feminism|feminists]], analytical feminists insist on recognizing and contesting [[sexism]] and [[androcentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ku.edu/~acudd/Anfemdef.htm |title=One Woman's Attempt at a Definition |author=Ann E. Cudd |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324073853/http://web.ku.edu/~acudd/Anfemdef.htm |archivedate=2012-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term “analytical feminism” dates back to the early 1990s when the Society for Analytical Feminism was opened in at the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/analyticalfeminism/|title= Society for Analytical Feminism |author= Norco College - Riverside Community College District}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used as an opportunity to discuss and examine issues concerning analytical feminism, in part to contrast the more prevalent influences of [[postmodernism]] and [[post-structuralism]], and also to demonstrate that analytic philosophy is neither inherently or  irredeemably male-biased. Analytic feminists have attempted to rehabilitate certain key concepts, such as truth, reason, objectivity, agency and autonomy, both because they are normatively compelling as well as in some ways liberating and empowering for women. Not limited to these concepts, analytical feminism has contributed to the historical arena of analytic philosophy such as the philosophy of language, [[epistemology]], [[metaphysic]]s and the [[philosophy of science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://books.publishing.monash.edu/apps/bookworm/view/A+Companion+to+Philosophy+in+Australia+and+New+Zealand/56/xhtml/chapter01.html#chapter01sec04|title=History of Analytical Feminism|author=Monash University Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the American philosophical magazine ''[[Hypatia]]'' published a special issue&lt;ref name="Hy 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Hypatia-Special Issue: Analytic Feminism-August 1995|journal=Hypatia|volume=10|issue=3|doi=10.1111/hypa.1995.10.issue-3|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; clarifying the meaning of analytic feminism in the mainstream Anglo-American analytical context and in the range of [[Feminist philosophy|feminist philosophical positions]]. In this issue, the authors such as [[Ann Cudd]] of the [[University of Kansas]], [[Ann Garry]] of [[California State University Los Angeles]], and Lynn Hankinson Nelson of the [[University of Washington]] proposed that analytic feminism typically was unrecognized and  somewhat depreciated by not only analytical philosophers but academic  feminist agenda as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.women.it/cyberarchive/files/allegrini.htm|title=THE NATURALISM QUESTION. HOW TO RE-THINK THE ANALYTIC – CONTINENTAL DICOTHOMY FROM A FEMINIST EPISTEMOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE|author=Alessandra Allegrini|access-date=2011-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928142832/http://www.women.it/cyberarchive/files/allegrini.htm#|archive-date=2011-09-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considered a sub-category of both analytic philosophy, and feminism, analytic feminism acknowledge the philosophical traditions of both fields while simultaneously addressing prominent issues within said fields.

==Philosophical approach==
Analytical feminism, as defined by Ann E. Cudd: "Analytic feminism holds that the best way to counter  [[sexism]] and [[androcentrism]] is through forming a clear conception of and pursuing truth, logical consistency, objectivity, rationality, justice, and the good while recognising that these notions have often been perverted by androcentrism throughout the history of philosophy." (1996: 20) Analytic feminists engage the literature traditionally thought of as analytic philosophy, but also draw on other traditions in philosophy as well as work by feminists working in other disciplines, especially [[sociology]] and [[biology]]. They, like most [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]], value clarity and precision in argument and tend to use more rigorously structured logical and linguistic analysis in reaching their conclusions and positions as compared to other philosophical approaches.

The majority of philosophers, including feminist philosophers, have at least some formal training in analytic philosophy, with some possessing extensive education and experience regarding analyticity. There has been a conscious effort to use the word ‘analytical’, the reason being that within the field of philosophy there is sometimes an inclination to assume all feminist work as tied to other methods to philosophy, whereas upon review much of the work in feminism is closer in method to analytic conventions.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

According to most analytic feminists, the  best method for scholars to counter sexism and androcentrism in their respective areas of inquiry is by forming a clear conception of and practicing logical consistency and [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bookrags.com/research/analytic-feminism-eoph/ |title= Analytic Feminism |author= bookrags }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doctrines===
Even though analytical feminists retain only some traditional concepts{{Clarify|date=February 2013}}, it is not doctrinaire—indeed, there is even a spirit of contrarianism within it. Nevertheless, analytic feminists share a thing that we may call a "core desire" rather than a core principle, that is to say, the need to hold on to enough of the essential normative notions of the modern European tradition to aid the kind of [[norm (social)|norm]]ativity which is necessary for both [[feminist political theory]] and philosophy. This "core desire"  finds its appearance by means of the core concepts of analytical feminism.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bridge building===
Analytic feminists' use of core ideas and their excerpt to the work of traditional analytic philosophers permit them to communicate with and build bridges amongst different types of scholars, for example, traditional analytic philosophers, other feminist philosophers, and, in some cases, scientists or scholars in social studies.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconstructing philosophy===
One tenet of analytic feminism holds that if philosophers positions are applicable universally, they must be usable by men and women alike, and from a range of social situations. This is a basis for what can be considered the reconstruction of philosophy via analytic feminism. This approach, which somewhat mirrors the construction of feminist philosophy tradition, attempts to limit the creation of areas or categories of philosophy that apply to only some women and feminists. It's an attempt to apply to 'all' (men and women) instead of 'some' (women and/or feminists) with specific examples of topics being feminine ethics, gynocentric ethics, or lesbian ethics. The basis for this universal approach would be an analytic feminist ethics and metaphysics which would create and establish a new criterion of adequacy for the fields of ethics and metaphysics. The goal of Miranda Fricker and Jennifer Hornsby, editors of ''The Cambridge Companion to Feminism in Philosophy'', is to have this position included in the mainstream of the discipline  (Fricker and Hornsby 2000).

Not basing the approach on any 'essential' characteristics, be they experiences or otherwise, it can maintain the importance of a variety of perspectives, while crafting a 'working' theory. 'Working' is defined as being particularly inclusive, of both men and women, but also simultaneously eliminating oppressive consequences. A wide range of experiences, interests, and background must be reflected with the theory 'working' only if it is applicable to all these issues and concerns.

There are a variety of approaches regarding the reconstruction of philosophy within analytic feminism. Some philosophers, such as Bailey (Bailey 2010) and Gary (Garry 2012), include the use of [[intersectionality]] in their approach. Miranda Fricker (2007) and Kristie Dotson (2011) make use of concept of [[Privilege (social inequality)]] in theirs, particularly with regard to epistemic ignorance and [[epistemic injustice]].&lt;ref&gt;

'''Bede Griffiths''' [[Camaldolese|OSB Cam]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osb.org/new/2001-2005/0504new.html Order of St Benedict website]&lt;/ref&gt; (17 December 1906 – 13 May 1993), born '''Alan Richard Griffiths''' and also known by the end of his life as '''Swami Dayananda''' ("bliss of compassion"), was a British-born [[Benedictine]] [[monk]] and priest who lived in [[ashram]]s in South India and became a noted [[yogi]]. He became a leading thinker in the development of the dialogue between Christianity and [[Hinduism]]. Griffiths was a part of the [[Christian Ashram Movement]].

==Biography==

===Early years===
Griffiths was born in [[Walton-on-Thames]], Surrey, England, at the end of 1906, the youngest of three children of a middle-class family. Shortly after Griffiths' birth, his father was betrayed by a business partner and was left penniless. His mother took the children and established residence in a smaller home which she maintained, though she had to find work to support herself and the children. At age 12, Griffiths was sent to [[Christ's Hospital]], a school for poor boys.&lt;ref name="Bede"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fastiggi|first1=Robert|last2=Pereira|first2=Jose|title=The Sawmi from Oxford|url=http://www.bedegriffiths.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/The-Swami-from-Oxford.pdf|accessdate=20 October 2017|work=Crisis|issue=March 1991|date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students of this school were nicknamed "bluecoats". He excelled in his studies and earned a scholarship to the [[University of Oxford]] where, in 1925, he began his studies in English literature and philosophy at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]]. In his third year at university he came under the tutelage of [[C. S. Lewis]], who became a lifelong friend. Griffiths graduated from Oxford in 1929 with a degree in journalism.

Shortly after graduation Griffiths, with fellow Oxford alumni [[Martyn Skinner]] and Hugh Waterman, settled in a cottage in the [[Cotswold]]s and began what they called an "experiment in common living".&lt;ref&gt;The golden string. 1954&lt;/ref&gt; They followed a lifestyle attuned to nature, milking cows and selling the milk to support themselves. They would read the Bible together as a form of literature. Griffiths noted a strong connection between the teachings of [[Scripture]] and the rhythm of the nature around them. The experiment lasted less than a year, as one of the friends found the life too demanding. Nevertheless, the experience had a strong effect on Griffiths.

As a result of this experience, Griffiths decided to seek [[Holy Orders]] in the [[Church of England]]. He was advised, however, to gain some experience in the slums of London. This advice was so contrary to what Griffiths felt to be his [[vocation]] that it drove him to a crisis of faith, which nearly drove him to an emotional breakdown.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Guided by the writings of [[Cardinal Newman]], he reached a point in this struggle where he had a spiritual breakthrough. He recounts the story of his conversion in his autobiography ''The Golden String''.

In November 1931, Griffiths went to stay at the [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] [[monastery]] of [[Prinknash Abbey]] where he was impressed by the life. Despite the strong anti-Roman Catholic sentiments of his mother, he was received into the Roman Catholic Church and made his [[First Communion]] at Christmas Eve [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]] at the abbey.

===Benedictine monastic life===
Griffiths was received by the abbey as a [[postulant]] a month after his reception into the Catholic Church. On 29 December 1932, he entered the [[novitiate]] and was given the monastic name of "Bede". He made his solemn [[profession]] in 1937 (a year before the death of his mother in a car accident) and was [[ordained]] to the [[Catholic priesthood]] in 1940.

In 1947 the abbey sent a group of 25 monks to give support to two monasteries in the United Kingdom which had been founded by monks from France. Griffiths was chosen to be the [[prior|obedientiary prior]] for the monastery at [[St Michael's Abbey, Farnborough|Farnborough]] in Hampshire. He led that house for four years, but was unable to generate sufficient financial support to keep the community going. The abbot then sent him to the other monastery, [[Pluscarden Abbey]] in Scotland. It was there that he wrote his autobiography.

During Griffiths' time at Farnborough, he had come to know Father Benedict Alapatt, a European-born monk of Indian descent who was greatly interested in establishing a monastery in his homeland. Griffiths had already been introduced to Eastern thought, [[yoga]] and the [[Vedas]] and took interest in this proposed project. The abbot at first refused permission, but later changed his mind and authorised Griffiths to go to India with the Indian member of the community. There was one condition, though: Griffiths was not to be there as a member of the abbey, but as a priest subject to a local bishop, which meant that he would be giving up his vows.

===Christian yogi===
After some painful inner debate, Griffiths agreed to this and, in 1955, he embarked for India with Alapatt. At the time, he wrote to a friend: "I am going to discover the other half of my soul."{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} After arriving and visiting some spiritual centres in the country, they settled in [[Kengeri]] in [[Bangalore, India|Bangalore]], considered{{by whom|date=November 2011}} the garden spot of India, with the goal of building a monastery there. That project was eventually unsuccessful as Griffiths left the location in 1958, saying that he found it "too Western".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Man, monk, mystic|first=Sister Pascaline, OSB|last=Coff|work=The Bede Griffiths Trust|url=http://www.bedegriffiths.com/bede-griffiths/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffiths then joined with a [[Belgian people|Belgian]] monk, Father [[Francis Acharya]], [[Trappists|OCSO]], to establish [[Kristiya Sanyasa Samaj,Kurisumala Ashram|Kristiya Sanyasa Samaj, Kurisumala Ashram]] ("Mountain of the Cross"), a [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Rite]] monastery of the [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]] in Kerala. They sought to develop a form of monastic life based in the Indian tradition, adopting the [[saffron]] garments of an Indian ''[[sannyasi]]'' (an [[ascetic]] or monk). At that point, Griffiths took the [[Sanskrit]] name "'''Dayananda'''" ("bliss of compassion"). During that time he continued his studies in the religions and cultures of India, writing ''Christ in India'' while there. He also visited the United States during the period, giving a number of talks about East–West dialogue and being interviewed by [[CBS]] television.

Later, in 1968, Griffiths moved to the [[Saccidananda Ashram]] (also known as ''Shantivanam''; [[Tamil language|Tamil]] for "forest of peace") in [[Tamil Nadu]], South India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bedegriffiths.com/ashrams/ |work=The Bede Griffiths Trust |title=Saccidananda Ashram |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613061415/http://www.bedegriffiths.com/ashrams/ |archivedate=13 June 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been founded in 1950 by the French Benedictine monk [[Abhishiktananda]] (Dom Henri Le&amp;nbsp;Saux, OSB), from the [[Abbey of Kergonan]], along with another Frenchman, the [[Abbé]] Jules Monchanin. The two had developed a religious lifestyle which was completely expressed in authentic Indian fashion, using English, Sanskrit and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] in their religious services. They had built the ashram buildings by hand in the style of the poor of the country. Monchanin had died in 1957 and Le&amp;nbsp;Saux wanted to devote himself to a [[hermit]]'s life. Griffiths came with two other monks to assume life there and to allow Le&amp;nbsp;Saux his wish.

Griffiths resumed his studies of Indian thought, trying to relate it to Christian theology. At this point, he became known as "'''Swami Dayananda'''" ("bliss of compassion"). He wrote 12 books on [[Hindu]]–Christian dialogue. During this period, Griffiths desired to reconnect himself with the Benedictine order and sought a monastic [[congregation (Catholic)|congregation]] which would accept him in the way of life he had developed over the decades. He was welcomed by the [[Camaldolese]] monks, and he and the ashram became a part of their congregation.

===Final years===
In January 1990, Griffiths suffered a stroke in his room at the ashram. A month later, to the day, he was declared healed. The following year, he began a period of extensive travel, making annual visits to the United States, then later to Europe, where he met the [[Dalai Lama]]. He noted to a friend, "I do believe that he liked me."&lt;ref&gt;"Bede Griffiths:Meeting the Dalai Lama" by  Meath Conlin on his website, Diverse Journeys, 22 June 2010 [http://diversejourneys.com/?p=1214]&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his journey, giving lectures in Germany and England. He arrived back at the ashram in October 1992, where an Australian film crew were awaiting him to make a documentary about his life, which was released as ''A Human Search''.

Three days after the completion of filming, on his 86th birthday, Griffiths had a major stroke. The following month, he had a further series of strokes. He died at Shantivanam on 13 May 1993, aged 86.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6587">[[Image:Bembine Table of Isis.png|thumb|300px|right|The '''Bembine Table of Isis'''.]]
The '''Bembine Tablet''', the '''Bembine Table of Isis''' or the '''''Mensa Isiaca''''' ('''Isiac Tablet''') is an elaborate tablet of bronze with enamel and silver inlay, most probably of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] origin but imitating the [[ancient Egypt]]ian style. It was named in the [[Renaissance]] after [[Cardinal Bembo]], a celebrated antiquarian who acquired it after the 1527 [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome]]. Thereafter it was used by antiquarians to penetrate the meaning of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], which were not authentically deciphered [[Jean-François Champollion|until the 19th century]]. Owing to these prior misconceptions, the tablet became of importance to western esoteric traditions.

==Origin and construction==
The ''Tablet'' is now regarded as of Roman rather than Egyptian origin, dating to some time in the first century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.museoegizio.it/en/the-museum|title=The Museum - Museo Egizio di Torino|work=Museo Egizio di Torino|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known of its subsequent history until after the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome in 1527]], when Cardinal Bembo acquired it from a certain locksmith or ironworker into whose hands it had fallen. After Bembo's death in 1547, the ''Tablet'' was acquired by the [[Duke of Mantua|Gonzaga rulers of Mantua]], remaining in their museum until the capture of the city in 1630 by [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]]'s troops. It then passed through various hands until the French conquest of Italy in 1797. [[Alexandre Lenoir]] mentioned in 1809 that it was on exhibition in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]]. After Napoleon's downfall it was returned to [[Italy]] to become a central exhibit in what is now the [[Museo Egizio]] at Turin, where it has remained.&lt;ref&gt;William Bates, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/oddnotes/bembo.html The Brazen Table of Bembo &amp; Hieroglyphics]&lt;/ref&gt;

The tablet was made of bronze with enamel and silver inlay, the figures cut very shallow and the contours of most of them delineated with thin silver wire. The bases on which the figures sat were covered with silver, later torn away, and these sections are left blank in the engraved reproduction above.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Dudley Fosbroke]], ''Encyclopædia of Antiquities''&lt;/ref&gt; It is an important example of ancient [[metallurgy]], its surface being decorated with a variety of metals including silver, gold, copper-gold alloy and various base metals. One of the metals employed is black, made by alloying copper and tin with small amounts of gold and silver, and then "pickling" it in organic [[acid]]. This black metal is possibly a variety of the "[[Corinthian bronze]]" described by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Plutarch]].

==Interpretations==
[[Image:Bembine Levi.png|thumb|right|[[Eliphas Levi]]'s key to the Bembine Tablet]]
[[Image:Bembine Westcott.png|thumb|right|[[William Wynn Westcott]]'s key to the Bembine Tablet]]

Although the scenes are Egyptianising, they do not depict Egyptian rites. Figures are shown with non-customary attributes, making it unclear which are divinities and which kings or queens. Egyptian motifs are used without rhyme or reason. However, the central figure is recognisable as Isis, suggesting that the ''Tablet'' originated in some Roman centre of her worship.

One of the earliest scholars to study the tablet was [[Pierio Valeriano Bolzani]], who may have seen it before it became generally known after the sack of 1527. His ''Hieroglyphica sive de sacris Aegyptiorum litteris commentarii'' seems to have been composed earlier than that, although it was published much later. The work covered the whole field of the meaning of hieroglyphics, but lacked the scholarly rigour of the antiquarian Laurentius Pignorius (1571–1631), whose ''Characteres Aegyptii, hoc est Sacrorum, quibus Aegyptii utuntur, simulachrorum accurata delineatio et explicatio'' of 1608 investigates the origin of the tablet as an archaeological object. Avoiding interpretation of the meaning, the author expressed doubt as to whether the images  were at all meaningful, in which he was subsequently proven right.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Raybould, ''Emblemata: Symbolic Literature of the Renaissance'', Grollier Club, New York 2009, pp. 92–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the 17th century, the [[Jesuit]] scholar [[Athanasius Kircher]]&lt;ref&gt; Kircher is described as "probably the supreme representative of Hermeticism within the post-Reformation Church" on p. 235 of Baigent, M. &amp; Leigh, R. ''The Elixir and The Stone'', Penguin 1997 (reprinted 2005). See also ''Athanasius Kircher: The Last Man Who Knew Eeverything'', ed. Paula Findlen, Routledge, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[Oedipus Aegyptiacus]]'' (1652) used the tablet as a primary source for developing his translations of hieroglyphics, which are now known to be incorrect. His book was the source for the English physician and philosopher [[Sir Thomas Browne]], who, in his discourse ''[[The Garden of Cyrus]]'' (1658) alludes to "the figures of Isis and Osyris, and the Tutelary spirits in the Bembine Table". Seventeenth century scholars of comparative religion such as Kircher and Browne attempted to reconcile the wisdom of antiquity with Christianity, the Bembine Tablet was interpreted as a vehicle for such syncretic thought; thus Browne proposes in his discourse: 

"Though he that considereth........ the crosse erected upon a pitcher diffusing streams of water into two basins, with sprinkling branches in them, and all described upon a two-footed altar, as in the Hieroglyphicks of the brazen Table of ''Bembus'' will hardly decline all thought of Christian signality in them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/gardennoframes/garden1.html|title=The Garden of Cyrus: Chapter I|website=penelope.uchicago.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Kircher's speculations were used by several occultists, including [[Eliphas Levi]], [[William Wynn Westcott]] and [[Manly P. Hall]], as a key to interpreting the "[[Book of Thoth]]" or [[Tarot]]. Platonistic writer [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]] even claimed that this tablet formed the altar before which [[Plato]] stood as he received initiation within a subterranean hall in the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]].&lt;ref&gt;Manly Palmer Hall, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/sta/sta13.htm ''The Secret Teachings of All Ages''], 1928&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NMMP dolphin with locator.jpeg|thumb|Bottlenose dolphin ([[Tursiops truncatus]]) of the NMMP on mineclearance operations, with locator beacon.]]
The '''Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute''' (BDRI) is a research and educational centre dedicated to the understanding and conservation of cetaceans and the marine environment in which they live. The Institute's BDRI centre was founded by the biologist Bruno Díaz López in [[Sardinia]], Italy in 2005. In 2014, the BDRI opened a new facility in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], Spain. 

BDRI concentrates its efforts on research into [[dolphins]] because they are predators at the top of their [[food chain]], so their well-being provides an excellent indication of the health of the entire [[ecosystem]] on which they, and humans, depend. Whales and dolphins around the world are under threat from [[marine pollution]], [[over-fishing]], getting entangled in nets, [[whaling]] and uncontrolled tourism.

The BDRI is intended to contribute to the understanding and conservation of dolphins, expand the public's knowledge and concern for the marine environment, and add to the knowledge base of bottlenose dolphins through publications of collected and analysed field data. Using study techniques that neither harm nor seriously disturb the animals, the BRDI is currently engaged in the conduction of a long-term study about the ecology and behaviour of a bottlenose dolphin population, as well as collecting detailed information about their environment.

The BDRI has educational and research programmes aimed at providing extra support for scientists early in their careers, science students, local students and scientists from developing countries, including training
opportunities in the field, grants, and online and field courses.

==Significance of BDRI research projects==

Cetacean populations are affected by man's use of coastal waters, particularly by fisheries activities and habitat modification. BDRI research projects provide scientific data to assist environmental agencies in managing and conserving marine natural resources and to obtain fundamental knowledge about this behaviourally flexible and cosmopolitan species. Their programs are conducted under a Research Permit issued by the Department of Environment of the Galician Government as part of our cooperation with the national networking for the study of marine mammals (CEMMA).
Additional studies by the BDRI have also been conducted in Italy, Spain and Abu Dhabi to date.

===Previous and current BDRI research projects===

BDRI researchers address a wide range of questions to form a multi-dimensional picture of the marine mammals behaviour and ecology and its relationship to the rest of the planet, including human society. The BDRI research has a multidisciplinary approach where we currently focus on four main research projects:
 
- Cetacean distribution along Galician coast: Current studies by the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute BDRI research team principally focus on the cetacean species frequenting the inshore waters of the outer Arousa Firth, however, a new area like Galician coastal waters (north-west Spain) offers us to also take on new projects and a more diverse range of issues and species. These waters are characterized by high biodiversity and productive fisheries, supported by nutrient input due to upwelling. Twenty species of cetaceans have been recorded in Galician waters, of which the most abundant appear to be short-beaked common dolphins and bottlenose dolphins. Other species present in the area include harbour porpoises, Risso’s dolphins and long-finned pilot whale. Conservation issues for cetaceans in Galician waters include interactions with fisheries, which may be a significant cause of mortality, overfishing, and oil spills. Hence, the information collected will inform conservation plans by identifying coastal areas of high importance to cetaceans. Wild bottlenose dolphins and humans frequenting the same small areas makes boat interaction more or less inevitable. BDRI researchers provided quantified data about bottlenose dolphin diving behaviour in the presence and absence of boats in Galicia. The data reported by BDRI researchers could be used to implement precautionary management proposals that take into account the potential effects of boat presence on dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;Diaz Lopez, B., Shirai, J.A.; Bilbao Prieto, A. &amp; Méndez Fernández, P., 2008.

- Behavioural ecology of dolphins and impact of human activities on their lives: Much of the research work is based upon repeat observations of individually-recognisable dolphins, providing data for a range of long-term and ongoing studies on the abundance, site fidelity, home range, social structure and behaviour of this population. The study of dolphins social structures defines an important class of ecological relationships between individuals and their nearby conspecifics. Common bottlenose dolphins live in fission–fusion societies within which individuals associate in small groups that change in composition, often on a daily or hourly basis. Fission–fusion societies limit the effect of within-unit competition through unit splits during periods of high competition, and they enhance cooperative effects through unit cohesion when the ecological costs of aggregating are low or benefits of sociality are high. Human activities can influence the distribution of food resources, which may promote the evolution of social organizations as a response to fluctuations in the costs of feeding competition. Therefore, fission–fusion societies present a good opportunity to examine the costs and benefits of association in dolphin populations affected by human use of coastal waters, especially by fisheries activities and habitat modification.
 
Individual-based studies focusing explicitly the variability of social unit structure in relation to anthropogenic factors are few. In this project, BDRI researchers will study the patterns of association of different populations of bottlenose dolphins (in Italy and Spain) and will describe the way in which their association behaviour is related to the way they respond to food patches created by human activities. BDRI researchers studied interactions between dolphins and [[gillnets]] along the north-eastern coast of Sardinia (Italy). Although dolphins benefit from taking fish entangled in gillnets, the association with gillnets is harmful because it exposes dolphins to additional risk. An observed annual estimate of the number of dolphins caught in gillnets was 3.54%. The extent of the estimated [[by-catch]] is worrisome in terms of the ability of bottlenose dolphins off Sardinia to sustain such an annual loss. The higher annual numbers of immature dolphins than adults dolphins caught in gillnets was related with a lack of experience together with and the tendency of immatures to play and/or to spend a lot of time scouting.&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez et al 2013"&gt;Diaz Lopez B., Addis A., Fabiano, F., 2013.

BDRI's researchers have also examined the effects of aquaculture on marine fauna in general, and more specifically, the impacts of aquaculture on dolphins in different marine fin fish farms off the coast of Sardinia, Italy. One of the objectives of these studies was to determine the variables that influence the presence and abundance of dolphins in the fish farms area.&lt;ref name="Fortuna M 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortuna M 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2012"&gt;Díaz López B. , 2012.

Marine [[aquaculture]] and, in particular intensive fish farming, have shown a large expansion in most Mediterranean countries over the last ten years. To curb predation, many marine fish farms employ control methods which exclude, harass or remove predators. One such method, predator netting, creates a physical barrier that protects farmed fish from attacks by airborne and underwater predators. The incidental capture of [[marine mammals]] by commercial fisheries is often a controversial and emotive issue. A potential impact on marine mammals as a result of aquaculture interaction is death or injury through entanglement in gear. BDRI researchers carried out the first attempt in the Mediterranean basin to obtain information on encounter rate, group size and incidental capture of bottlenose dolphins in a marine fish farm. The regular occurrence of some dolphins suggests individual preferences for the fish farm area. The incidental bottlenose dolphin capture observed in large, loose predator nets is cause for concern, as it is questionable whether or not the bottlenose dolphins in the area can sustain incidental capture of this magnitude. The information gained from this study showed the necessity for further regulations to be established, both in the use of predator nets and management of marine fish farms.&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortuna M 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortuna M 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez B 2008"&gt;Diaz Lopez B. and Shirai, J.A., 2008.

Assessing the consequences of fisheries and habitat modification with relatively obvious effects on marine predators can be difficult. BDRI researchers were the first to show how coastal fisheries and aquaculture are not only directly affecting marine predators but could also indirectly affect their social structure and behaviour. BDRI researchers suggest that the main management issues raised by their studies relates to the dolphins' habitat. The feeding opportunities for dolphins that are created by human activities have become part of their "way of life", part of their habitat requirements. When top predators display complex social responses to activities not directed at them, the task of studying all possible effects in the food chain can become even more challenging. Further work should focus on elucidating how human activities induce social and spatial changes in marine top predators.&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez B 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diaz Lopez B., Bunke, M. and Shirai, J.A., 2008.

BDRI researchers observed that the use of [[Underwater locator beacon|pinger]]s reduces dolphin mortality due to bycatch on gillnets.

Bottlenose dolphins living around coastal regions have received much attention due to their increased vulnerability of inhabiting areas where marine traffic is concentrated. [[Marine traffic]] has previously been observed to elicit responses in [[cetacean]] behaviours, but the cause and effects of these interactions has yet to be fully understood. BDRI's current study area of Aranci Bay, Sardinia, provides a unique insight into an area where the interactions of bottlenose dolphins and vessels remains largely unchecked. Our studies showed that the dolphins were surfacing less regularly in the presence of vessels and this response was further enhanced during vessel approaches. Moreover, by examining the influence of different types of vessel it was evident that the dolphins elicited a stronger response to tourist than fisheries vessels. The behaviour vessels display around the dolphins as well as speed, engine type and distance of approach were all factors that needed to be taken into consideration when analysing the changes observed. Research is contributing to a wider management scheme to ensure that marine traffic is monitored effectively when bottlenose dolphins are present.&lt;ref&gt;Underhill, K., Diaz Lopez, B., and Shirai, J.A., 2007.

- Dolphins communication: [[Bioacoustics]] research provides important insights into animal behavior. Dolphins (family: Delphinidae) are an extremely vocal mammalian family and vocal communication plays an important role in mediating social interactions. Most BDRI studies of delphinid vocalizations have concentrated on bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus (in the Mediterranean, Italy, and in the Atlantic Ocean, Spain) and T. aduncus (in the [[Persian Gulf]], Abu Dhabi, UAE). Until recently, communication behaviour had a limited role in conservation, being restricted to enhancing captive breeding programs or use in species counts. However, knowledge of how individuals within a population communicate can generate information ranging from measures of habitat use, social relevance, geographical variation, cultural transmission, etc., that can be applied to conservation. Marine mammals use sound for activities essential to survival and reproduction. Bottlenose dolphins are extremely vocal mammalian species, and vocal communication plays an important role in mediating social interactions. Amid the abundant literature pertaining to vocalizations of bottlenose dolphins, very little is known about the vocal repertoire of Mediterranean wild bottlenose dolphins. BDRI bioacoustical studies carried out year round from 2005 represent the first attempt to obtain information on the repertoire and production patterns of bottlenose dolphins resident in an area characterized by important interaction with human activities (tourism, aquaculture and coastal fisheries). Many vocal signals were strongly implicated in social and feeding interactions. Although many of these vocalizations have been previously described in the literature, their association with specific behaviours linked with human activities provides additional contextual information about their potential use as communication signals. One of BDRI's most recent projects shows that the number of whistles recorded in a group increased significantly as the number of mother-calf pairs increased, confirming that whistles may be used as contact calls. These studies use benign techniques to demonstrate the great diversity of communication signals emitted and indicate a functional role of these vocalizations during the observed behaviours.&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2008"&gt;Diaz Lopez, B and Shirai, J.A., 2008.

"Whistle characteristics in free-ranging bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Mediterranean Sea: influence of behaviour". Mammalian Biology 76: 180-189.&lt;/ref&gt; Cetaceans (dolphins, whales and porpoises) are often faced with the challenge of hearing strange sounds in environments with noise from both natural and anthropogenic sources. BDRI researchers have documented that human-introduced noise induces behavioural reactions in bottlenose dolphins. In addition noise pollution is being considered as a cause of displacement of cetaceans from preferred habitats. Short-term noise pollution may not create significant problems. Repeated or long-term noise pollution, however, can cause stress and debilitation and may be related to dolphin mortality. Related scientific publications:&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2008"/&gt;

- Dolphins in the [[Persian Gulf]]: At least ten species of cetacean have been identified in the Persian Gulf, but most of these are considered vagrant or seasonal visitor. Only two species of dolphin, the Indo-Pacific humpback (Sousa chinensis) and the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) are thought to be common residents of the Gulf. The finless porpoise (Neophocoena phocaenoides) is thought to be an uncommon resident.

The conservation status of these species in Abu-Dhabi waters is totally unknown, largely because of the lack of research on either species. The world conservation status of these species is Data Deficient, that is, there is insufficient information on which to make an assessment. This deficiency hampers conservation and management efforts and our ability to assess the impact of human activities on local populations of this species.

BDRI researchers participate in cooperation with the Environmental Agency of Abu Dhabi since 2014, for the first time in Abu Dhabi waters, in a research project in order to obtain accurate data on population estimate, distribution, potential threats and residence patterns of dolphin species observed in coastal waters of Abu-Dhabi (UAE). The final purpose of this project is to inform and improve the design of conservation and management interventions towards these species in Abu-Dhabi waters.&lt;ref&gt;Díaz López B, and Methion S, 2015.

== BDRI Environmental policy==
As a marine science research team, BDRI researchers have witnessed first hand the effects [[global warming]] and [[climate change]] have on our planet. Every year new tropical species are catalogued in north Sardinia as having arrived from tropical waters as an effect of global warming, and entire ecosystems are being affected. BDRI researchers are committed to the implementation of proactive measures to help protect and sustain the local and global environment for future generations. The BDRI aims to achieve the objective of improved environmental performance through pollution prevention and continuous improvement. All BDRI members, workers and volunteers are expected to conduct their work in a manner compatible with the BDRI's Responsible Travel policy and objectives.

Collection maintenance is a form of [[collections care]] that consists of the day-to-day hands on care of collections and cultural heritage. The primary goal of '''collections maintenance''' is to prevent further decay of cultural heritage by ensuring proper storage and upkeep including performing regular housekeeping of the spaces and objects and monitoring and controlling storage environments. Collections maintenance is closely linked to [[collections care]] and [[collections management (museum)|collections management]]. The professionals most influenced by collections maintenance include [[collection manager]]s, [[registrar (museum)|registrars]], and [[archivist]]s.

==Environmental Control==
There are four main environmental agents of deterioration which should be monitored on a regular basis as part of maintenance. These are temperature, relative humidity, light and dust. It is important to recognize the type of damage each agent may present as well as ways to mitigate any harm.

===Temperature===
Temperature as an agent of deterioration acts primarily in conjunction with relative humidity but can trigger damage in its own right. At the extremes, temperature can cause structural damage to some materials; paint may become brittle in excessive heat and some plastics may soften or melt in the heat.&lt;ref name="NPS,Chp4"&gt;{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections|year =1998|chapter =Chapter 4: Museum Collections Environment|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAPTER4.pdf|accessdate= April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; “High temperatures also accelerate chemical and biological processes.” &lt;ref name="Historic House chp 5"&gt;{{cite book|last =Staniforth|first =Sarah|title =Manual of Housekeeping: The Care of Collections in Historic Houses Open to the Public|place =Amsterdam |publisher =Elsevier|year =2006|chapter =5: Agents of Deterioration|page =51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relative Humidity===
[[File:Termoigrografo 01.jpg|thumbnail|A thermo-hygrograph]]

[[Relative Humidity]] (RH) is the amount of water held in the air as related to how much could be held in fully saturated air. The possible amount of moisture held at a given time is directly related to temperature; warm air holds more humidity than cold. Collecting institutions aim to keep the RH constant in exhibitions and storage areas because many organic objects expand and contract as both temperature and RH change.&lt;ref name="Basics ch3"&gt;{{cite book|last =Ambrose|first =Timothy|last2 =Paine|first2 =Crispin |title =Museum Basics|place =London|publisher =Routledge|year =2006|edition =2|chapter =3: The Development and Care of the Museum’s Collections}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furniture will swell and stick with high moisture, but may crack or shrink if there is too little. “Rapidly fluctuating temperature and relative humidity compound all of these effects.” &lt;ref name="Concerns pg15"&gt;{{cite book|last =Bachmann|first =Konstanze|title =Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =Smithsonian Books|year =1992|chapter =Control of Temperature and Humidity in Small Collections|page =15}}&lt;/ref&gt; High humidity may accelerate mold growth and some chemical changes, like metal corrosion, if not properly maintained.&lt;ref name="Housekeeping chp10"&gt;{{cite book|last =Staniforth|first =Sarah|title =Manual of Housekeeping: The Care of Collections in Historic Houses Open to the Public|place =Amsterdam |publisher =Elsevier|year =2006|chapter =10: Relative Humidity as an Agent of Deterioration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some changes undergone by objects are reversible by adjusting the RH, but damage like cracks are more permanent. Keeping the RH within a reasonable span for the type of object and as consistent as possible will prevent most RH based damage. It is important to measure the RH of spaces regularly by using a number of tools including humidity strips, [[thermo-hygrograph]]s, [[hygrometer]]s, psychrometer and [[data logger]]s. Once the per cent humidity identified, there are a number of ways to adjust it by using humidifiers, dehumidifiers, improve heating and air conditioning systems and adjust the temperature of the space.

===Light===
Light, as it relates to collections maintenance, consists of visual and [[ultraviolet]] light (UV). Both types of light can cause damage as “light radiation falling on a surface provides energy to induce chemical changes in the molecules of the material.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Bullock|first =Linda|title =Manual of Housekeeping: The Care of Collections in Historic Houses Open to the Public|place =Amsterdam |publisher =Elsevier|year =2006|chapter =9: Light as an Agent of Deterioration|page =93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage from light, including loss of color and strength, is cumulative and irreversible. It is therefore crucial that light levels are monitored.

Preventing light damage is difficult because it is necessary for visitors as well as people who are working with the objects. Exposure, however, can be diminished by ensuring lights are only on when people are present, either by vigilant staff members turning on and off lights, timer switches or with motion sensors.

===Dust and Dirt===
Dust can contain a number of materials including skin, mold and inorganic fragments like silica or sulfur. It is important to keep collections free of dust whenever possible because it can become bound to a surface over time, making it that significantly more difficult to remove.&lt;ref name="Housekeeping chp6"&gt;{{cite book|last =Lloyd|first =Helen| last2 =Lithgow|first2 =Katy |title =Manual of Housekeeping: The Care of Collections in Historic Houses Open to the Public|place =Amsterdam |publisher =Elsevier|year =2006|chapter =6: Physical Agents of Deterioration|page =62}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dust is [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]], meaning it is able to attract and hold water molecules creating an ideal climate for [[mold]] spores to grow and cause biological damage.&lt;ref name="Winterthur chp1"&gt;{{cite book|last =Landrey|first =Gregory|last2=Hoag|first2=Robert|title =The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collections|place =Hanover|publisher =University Press of New England|year =2000|chapter =1:General Care|page =13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hygroscopic trait can also prompt chemical reactions on a surface, especially upon metals. Inorganic dust particles may have tough sharp edges which can cause a number of types of damage from tearing fibers to [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrading]] softer surfaces if not properly removed. Wiping a clean cloth over a surface dusty with these inorganic particles may result in irreversible abrasions.

The best way to prevent damage from dust is to control and prevent substantial buildup of dust in the first place. This can be done by using air filters in the heating and air conditioning systems as well as using vacuum cleaners equipped with [[HEPA]] filters when possible. Limiting the amount of exposed surface areas of collections can also prevent dust from settling on objects. This can be done by storing objects in acid-free boxes, object specific enclosures, in drawers or covering open shelves with a [[polyethylene]] sheet.&lt;ref name="Concerns"&gt;{{cite book|last =Bachmann|first =Konstanze|title =Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =Smithsonian Books|year =1992|chapter =Principles of Storage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Winterthur chp1"/&gt;

==Storage and Upkeep==
Maintaining a clean and orderly spaces ensures not only ease of accessibility but also the safety of the collections and those who work with them.

===Organization===
[[File:Archival collection.JPG|thumbnail|Example of two "layers;" the boxes and the shelves they rest upon]]
It is essential that collections have an organizational system to store and house objects. The system may be grounded in relations to size, material, cultural or historical grouping as it makes sense to the collection.&lt;ref name="Concerns"&gt;{{cite book|last =Bachmann|first =Konstanze|title =Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =Smithsonian Books|year =1992|chapter =Principles of Storage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NPS,Chp7"&gt;{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections|year =1998|chapter =Chapter 7: Museum Collections Storage|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAP7.pdf|accessdate= April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structured organizational systems make identifying object locations straightforward and consistent which will help locating and returning an object to its proper space.

Part of a system is the use of “successive layers of protective envelopes and enclosures.” &lt;ref name="NPS,Chp7"&gt;{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections|year =1998|chapter =Chapter 7: Museum Collections Storage|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAP7.pdf|accessdate= April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Types of “layers” include nearly everything from storage spaces, padded shelves, non-acidic archival boxes and individual packaging. Each new layer should provide further protection by creating a microclimate buffer between an object and environmental fluctuations, light, dust and pollutants.

===Housekeeping===
Keeping spaces clean and clear of debris is crucial to the preservation of object in several ways. Primarily it ensures that objects don’t become over exposed to detrimental agents like dust, but it also ensures that the areas are safe for people and objects to move within, unobstructed by potential hazards. Tasks that fall under this purview include routine inspection and dusting of work areas and objects, and general cleaning of work areas. Spaces and objects should be monitored and inspected regularly to ensure that any problem is caught and resolved quickly or note any condition change.&lt;ref name="Housekeeping chp12"&gt;{{cite book|last =Lloyd|first =Helen| last2 =Lithgow|first2 =Katy |title =Manual of Housekeeping: The Care of Collections in Historic Houses Open to the Public|place =Amsterdam |publisher =Elsevier|year =2006|chapter =12: Housekeeping Tasks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regularity of dusting and cleaning will differ institution to institution, and will depend upon factors like foot-traffic, how well the space is sealed off from the outside, and how long it takes for dust to build up. As a general rule, work areas should be cleaned frequently, storage areas and furniture less so, and objects dusted occasionally and only after consulting a conservator.&lt;ref name="NPS,Chp13"&gt;{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections|year =1998|chapter =Chapter 13: Museum Housekeeping|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAP13.pdf |accessdate= April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inside work areas, floors should be swept or vacuumed and work surfaces should be cleared off and dusted. Storage areas probably need less frequent attention, but should still have the floors cleaned and exposed surfaces of storage furniture like shelves wiped down. Objects themselves may sometimes need dusting if they are not boxed or wrapped up. Prior to dusting an object, the condition and stability needs to be considered, and a conservator should be consulted before any attempt is made. Research should also be done into how best to clean a particular type of medium or object.&lt;ref name="Housekeeping chp12"&gt;{{cite book|last =Lloyd|first =Helen| last2 =Lithgow|first2 =Katy |title =Manual of Housekeeping: The Care of Collections in Historic Houses Open to the Public|place =Amsterdam |publisher =Elsevier|year =2006|chapter =12: Housekeeping Tasks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
De Roure grew up in [[West Sussex]] and studied for an undergraduate degree in Mathematics with Physics at the [[University of Southampton]], completing his studies in 1984. He stayed on to do a Doctor of Philosophy degree&lt;ref name="davephd"&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|first=David |last=De Roure|authorlink=David De Roure|title=A Lisp environment for modelling distributed systems|publisher=University of Southampton|year=1990|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=918769}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1990 initially under the supervision of [[David W. Barron]] and Peter Henderson&lt;ref&gt;http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/ph/&lt;/ref&gt; on a [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp environment]] for modelling [[distributed computing]].

==Research and career==
Following an early career in medical electronics at [[Sonicaid]], De Roure held a longstanding position in the [[School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton]]&lt;ref name="soton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~dder/ |title=David De Roure, University of Southampton |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6A8BsK26r?url=http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~dder/ |archivedate=23 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; from its formation as a department in 1986, becoming a full professor in 2000. He was Warden of [[Wessex Lane Halls#South Stoneham House|South Stoneham House]] in the late 80s.  He was closely involved in the UK [[e-Science]] programme and is best known for the [[myExperiment]] website for sharing scientific [[workflow]]s and [[Research Object|research objects]], as well as the [[Semantic Grid]] initiative, the UK's [[OMII-UK|Open Middleware Infrastructure Institute (OMII-UK)]] and its successor, the [[Software Sustainability Institute]]. De Roure was the Director of Envisense, the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|DTI]] Next Wave Centre for Pervasive Computing in the Environment, from 2003-5. He moved to the Oxford e-Research Centre in July 2010.

In 2009 he was appointed as the National Strategic Director for e-Social Science by the UK [[Economic and Social Research Council|Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)]] and subsequently held the post of Strategic Advisor in the area of new and emerging forms of data and realtime analytics, leading to the commissioning of projects under phase 3 of the Big Data Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esrc.ac.uk/research/our-research/big-data-network/big-data-network-phase-3/|title=ESRC|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14131">'''[[Distributed ledger]] technology law''' ("'''DLT law'''") (also called '''[[Blockchain]] law'''.&lt;ref&gt;James G. Gatto, 'United States: Nevada Passes Pro-blockchain Law' (Mondaq, 23 June 2017) &lt;http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/604562/fin+tech/Nevada+Passes+Problockchain+Law&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Lex Cryptographia'''&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Aaron Wright and Primavera De Filippi, 'Decentralized Blockchain Technology and the Rise of Lex Cryptographia' (2015) SSRN Electronic Journal &lt;http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2580664&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;) is not yet defined and recognized but an emerging field of law due to the recent dissemination of distributed ledger technology application in business and governance environment.

== Analogy with the [[Law of the Horse]] and [[Legal aspects of computing|Law of cyberspace]] debate ==

Ubiquitous dissemination of [[information technology]] and the [[Internet]] led to a discussion of two opposite legal theories of the regulation of [[cyberspace]]. According to The [[Law of the Horse]] theory proposed by [[Frank H. Easterbrook]], general principles of law governing property, transactions and torts apply to any relationship whether in case of the horse or cyberspace and there is no reason to invent new fields of law designated for each.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Easterbrook, 'Cyberspace and the law of the horse' (1996) U Chi Legal F 207 &lt;https://www.law.upenn.edu/fac/pwagner/law619/f2001/week15/easterbrook.pdf&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was challenged by [[Lawrence Lessig]], who argued that in case of cyberspace the code may be considered as another way of regulation and therefore the cyberspace may be treated more widely than just another area of relations regulated by conventional legal principles.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Lessig, 'The Law of the Horse: What Cyberlaw Might Teach' (1999) 113 Harv L Rev 501 &lt;https://cyber.harvard.edu/works/lessig/finalhls.pdf&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Employing more liberal approach the DLT law may mean the body of law "characterized by a set of rules administered through self-executing smart contracts and decentralized (and potentially autonomous) organizations".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Areas of law ==

As of the beginning of 2018 the DLT law does not constitute a separate field of law rather it encompasses aspects of corporate, contract, investment, banking and finance law. According to conservative approach the DLT law may be considered as a part of existent area of law, which may be applied to regulate different aspects of DLT use and new kind of legal relations on blockchain, such as issue of authorisation (electronic signature), admissibility of blockchain evidence in court, status of [[cryptocurrency]] and regulation of [[initial coin offering]], use of [[smart contract]]s, status of [[The DAO (organization)|DAO]] (decentralized autonomous organization) and other.

== Status of blockchain-based records and smart contracts ==

While in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/search|title=UK Find legislation|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Union|EU]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://europa.eu/european-union/law/find-legislation_en|title=EU Find legislation|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the beginning of 2018 the legislators are still silent about blockchain technology, in the [[United States]] several states already enacted legislation providing a framework for business and legal application of blockchain technology and enforceability of smart contracts.

=== [[Vermont]] ===
On 2 June 2016 Vermont became the first state, which recognised blockchain-based records having legal bearing in a court under the Vermont Rules of Evidence and defined blockchain technology as "mathematically secured, chronological, and decentralized consensus ledger or database, whether maintained via Internet interaction, peer-to-peer network, or otherwise"&lt;ref&gt;House Bill 868 &lt;https://legislature.vermont.gov/assets/Documents/2016/Docs/ACTS/ACT157/ACT157%20As%20Enacted.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Arizona]] ===
In March 2017, Arizona’s Electronic Transactions Act (the AETA) was amended by HB 2417 Act to clarify that “electronic records, electronic signatures, and smart contract terms secured through blockchain technology and governed under UCC Articles 2, 2A and 7 will be considered to be in an electronic form and to be an electronic signature under AETA.”&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Neuburger, 'Arizona Passes Groundbreaking Blockchain and Smart Contract Law – State Blockchain Laws on the Rise' (Proscauer, 20 April 20, 2017) &lt;https://newmedialaw.proskauer.com/2017/04/20/arizona-passes-groundbreaking-blockchain-and-smart-contract-law-state-blockchain-laws-on-the-rise/&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; HB 2417 Act also provides a definition of blockchain technology as a “distributed, decentralized, shared and replicated ledger, which may be public or private, permissioned or permissionless, or driven by tokenized crypto economics or tokenless”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and definition of smart contract as "event driven program, with state, that runs on a distributed, decentralized, shared and replicated ledger that can take custody over and instruct transfer of assets on that ledger".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;House Bill 2417 &lt;https://legiscan.com/AZ/text/HB2417/id/1588180/Arizona-2017-HB2417-Chaptered.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The State also identifies areas where blockchain technology should not be used. For instance, the new law adopted in 2017 prohibits the use of blockchain technology to locate or control firearms.&lt;ref&gt;Craig de Ridder, Mercedes Tunstall, Nathalie Prescott, 'Recognition of smart contracts in the United States' (2017) Intellectual Property and Technology Law Journal Vol 29 No 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;House Bill 2216 &lt;https://legiscan.com/AZ/text/HB2216/2017&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Nevada]] ===
In June 2017 similar legislation has been enacted in Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Higgins, 'Nevada Senators Unanimously Advance Blockchain Tax Ban' (Coindesk, 26 April 2017) &lt;https://www.coindesk.com/nevada-senators-blockchain-tax-ban/&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, "Nevada has become the first state to ban local governments from taxing blockchain use".&lt;ref&gt;Stan Higgins, 'Nevada Becomes First US State to Ban Blockchain Taxes' (Coindesk, 06 June 2017) &lt;https://www.coindesk.com/nevada-first-us-state-ban-blockchain-taxes/&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the definition of blockchain, the Nevada Senate defines it as "an electronic record created by the use of a decentralized method by multiple parties to verify and store a digital record of transactions which is secured by the use of a cryptographic hash of previous transaction information".&lt;ref&gt;Senate Bill No 389 &lt;https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/79th2017/Bills/SB/SB398.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Delaware]] ===
On August 1, 2017, Delaware's blockchain law became effective, which amends the Delaware General Corporation Law explicitly permitting the use of distributed ledger technology in the administration of Delaware corporate records, including records of stock and stockholders.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Dodge, 'Delaware Authorizes Stocks on Blockchain' (Proskauer, 02 August 2017) &lt;https://newmedialaw.proskauer.com/2017/08/02/delaware-authorizes-stocks-on-blockchain/&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Senate Bill No. 60 &lt;https://legiscan.com/DE/text/SB69/id/1627743/Delaware-2017-SB69-Draft.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; "Before this new law was adopted, there was nothing specifically stopping a Delaware corporation from using blockchain technology to keep track of its stockholders, but there was also a great deal of regulatory uncertainty."&lt;ref&gt;Cindy Dole and Doneld Shelkey 'Delaware Blockchain Law Goes into Effect' (Morgan Lewis, 11 August 2017) &lt;https://www.morganlewis.com/blogs/sourcingatmorganlewis/2017/08/delaware-blockchain-law-goes-into-effect&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== DLT and law issues ==

=== Issue of [[Situs (law)|situs]] and place for [[dispute resolution]] ===
In the legal context DLT and smart contracts are distinct and face their own problems and challenges. Issue of situs is an example which relates to DLT rather than smart contracts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Linklaters and ISDA, ‘Smart Contracts and Distributed Ledger – A Legal Perspective’ (2017) &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.isda.org/a/6EKDE/smart-contracts-and-distributed-ledger-a-legal-perspective.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; International private law and legislation of various jurisdictions require to identify the location of an asset or place of an agreement in order to solve conflict of law problem and determine the applicable governing law. "However, the distribution of the register across nodes in multiple jurisdictions raises a seemingly intractable problem – under current legal principles at least – as to where the situs should be."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Holding something on DLT, including smart contract or title to an asset, does not isolate it from the legal system and laws of respective jurisdiction. "Some blockchain enthusiasts may have misinterpreted the statement ‘code is law’ as implying that code can supersede the law or that decentralised networks create their own legal regimes."&lt;ref&gt;Eliza Mik, ‘Smart contracts: terminology, technical limitations and real world complexity” (2017) Law Innovation and Technology Vol 9 No 2, 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

In case of a dispute between the parties of the smart contract within the DLT, the issue arises where the distributed ledger is located in order to determine the place for dispute resolution.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Reggie O'Shields, 'Smart Contracts: Legal Agreements for the Blockchain' (2017) North Carolina Banking Institute Vol 21, 177.&lt;/ref&gt; "Blockchain also poses questions concerning the ability to identify the parties to a transaction, to the extent a system utilizing this technology remains anonymous, which may rise a host of additional issues related to dispute resolution."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Issue of legal validity and update of code on DLT ===
An absence of legal [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] mechanism on DLT, [[Smart contract|self-executing]] nature of code on DLT and [[Blockchain|limited ability]] to update the code if the law changes create a number of legal issues. There are several  possible solutions of addressing these issues. "One method could be a system in which the relevant jurisdiction creates a publicly available database and [[Application Programming Interface (API)|application programming interface (API)]] of relevant legal provisions. These would be provisions related to the terms of the contract. The smart contract would call these terms and would be able to update those provisions terms in accord with the jurisdiction's update of the database."&lt;ref&gt;Max Raskin, ‘The Law and Legality of Smart Contracts’ (2017) 1 Geo L Tech Rev 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

On more conservative side of DLT and law interaction spectrum are two solutions proposed by [https://www.hse.ru/en/org/persons/57906411 Alexander Savelyev]:

"(1) To introduce the concept of a ‘Superuser’ for government authorities, which will have a right to modify the content of Blockchain databases in accordance with a specified procedure in order to reflect the decisions of state authority.

(2) To enforce decisions of state authorities in ‘offline’ mode by pursuing the specific users and forcing them to include changes in Blockchain themselves as well as by using traditional tort claims, unjust enrichment claims, and specific performance claims."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Savelyev, 'Contract law 2.0: ‘Smart’ contracts as the beginning of the end of classic contract law' (2017)  Information &amp; Communications Technology Law Vol 26 No 2, 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Issue of [[automation]] of smart contracts and 'Oracles'  ===
Subject to ability of distributed ledger to have access to terms and conditions by which performance of obligations under the smart contract must be assessed the execution of contracts on distributed ledger may be automated.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Thomas and Evan Schwartz, 'Smart Oracles: A Simple, Powerful Approach to Smart Contracts' (Github, 17 July 2014) &lt;https://github.com/codius/codius/wiki/Smart-Oracles:-A-Simple,-Powerful-Approach-to-Smart-Contracts&gt; accessed on 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; "In the [[interest rate swap]] example, the distributed ledger must have access to assets of the parties' in order to fulfil the parties' payment obligations, and it must have access to a provider of interest rate information."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Jenny Cieplak and Simon Leefatt, 'Smart contracts: A smart way to automate performance' (2017) 1 Geo L Tech Rev 417.&lt;/ref&gt; The solutions to the issue of access to assets vary and may be solved through locking and release of assets in smart contract as it is performed through use of cryptocurrency Ether on [[Ethereum]] blockchain&lt;ref&gt;Vitalik Buterin, 'Ethereum: A Next-Generation Cryptocurrency and Decentralized Application Platform' (BitcoinMagazine, 23 January 2014) &lt;https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/ethereum-next-generation-cryptocurrency-decentralized-application-platform-1390528211/&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; or by introducing new mechanism of access to assets like 'cash states' proposed by [[R3 (company)|Corda]] distributed ledger.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Hearn, 'Corda: A distributed ledger' (2016) &lt;https://docs.corda.net/_static/corda-technical-whitepaper.pdf&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the solution to the issue of access to information may require use of so-called 'Oracles' - an external parties providing the judgement to determine whether or not respective conditions under the agreement have been met.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; "Turning again to the interest rate swap example, an oracle could be used to provide interest rate information on a payment calculation date. The oracle's digital signature would be retained on the distributed ledger so that parties could review the payment process and confirm that payments were made correctly."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''Earth Charter Initiative''' is the collective name for the global network of people, organizations, and institutions who participate in promoting the [[Earth Charter]], and in implementing its principles in practice. The Initiative is a broad-based, voluntary, [[civil society]] effort, but participants include leading international institutions, national government agencies, university associations, [[non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, cities, faith groups, and many well-known leaders in [[sustainable development]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

== Mission and goals ==
The stated mission of the Earth Charter Initiative is to promote the transition to sustainable ways of living and a global society founded on a shared ethical framework that includes respect and care for the community of life, [[Ecological health|ecological integrity]], universal [[human rights]], [[Respect diversity|respect for diversity]], economic justice, [[democracy]], and a culture of [[peace]].

===Goals===
#To raise awareness worldwide of the Earth Charter and to promote understanding of its inclusive ethical vision.  
#To seek recognition and endorsement of the Earth Charter by individuals, organizations, and the [[United Nations]].
#To promote the use of the Earth Charter as an ethical guide and the implementation of its principles by civil society, business, and government.  
#To encourage and support the educational use of the Earth Charter in schools, universities, religious communities, local communities, and many other settings.  
#To promote recognition and use of the Earth Charter as a [[soft law]] document.

===Strategic objectives===
* To promote development of a global network of Earth Charter supporters and activists with the collaboration of advisors, affiliates, partner organizations, and task forces.
* To create and disseminate high quality communications and educational materials to different target groups that will reach millions of people.
* To translate key Earth Charter materials in all major languages of the world.
* To set up Earth Charter websites in all countries in partnership with key individuals and organizations.
* To promote the Earth Charter vision in key local, national and international events and engage individuals and organizations in applying it in their areas of activity.
* To position the Earth Charter in relation to important international initiatives and processes so that its ethical framework can be used as a guide in efforts to address urgent challenges such as climate change, [[biodiversity loss]], the [[Millennium Development Goals]], [[food security]], and [[conflict resolution]].
* To undertake training programmes to facilitate the uptake and application of the Earth Charter in different sectors.
* To develop the guidance and instruments to help organizations, businesses, and local communities use the Earth Charter to assess progress toward sustainable development.

== Organization ==
A formal network of affiliates, partners, and youth groups helps to promote the Earth Charter around the world. Many of these representatives are based in prominent national-level organizations and institutions.

The Initiative is served and coordinated by [[Earth Charter International]], which is composed by an Executive Office called the ECI Secretariat, and by the ECI Council.  The Secretariat is composed by a very small staff, and it is based at [[University for Peace|the University for Peace]] campus in [[San José, Costa Rica]]. The Council is equivalent to a Board, they meet once a year and provide strategic guidance to the Secretariat and the EC Initiative.

== Earth Charter Youth Program ==
The Earth Charter Youth program is a network of youth NGOs and young activists who share a common interest in sustainable development and the Earth Charter. [[Severn Cullis-Suzuki]] from Vancouver, Canada was nominated as [[youth]] representative in the Earth Charter Commission, which oversaw the drafting process. At the age of 17, Severn participated in the Earth Summit of 1997 and made sure that concerns of young people were taken seriously in the process of drafting the Earth Charter. She contributed to the inclusion of principle 12c in the final version of the Earth Charter which stresses the need to: “Honor and support the young people of our communities, enabling them to fulfill their essential role in creating sustainable societies.” The launch of the Earth Charter Youth program was inspired by this ethical principle. Today there are two youth representatives on the Earth Charter International Council.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14092">'''Entheogenic drugs''' have been used by various groups for thousands of years. There are numerous
historical reports as well as modern, contemporary reports of indigenous groups using [[entheogen]]s, [[chemical substance]]s used in a [[religion|religious]], [[shamanism|shamanic]], or [[spirituality|spiritual]] context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brazilian Archives of Biology and Technology - Jurema-Preta (Mimosa tenuiflora [Willd.] Poir.): a review of its traditional use, phytochemistry and pharmacology |publisher=scielo.br |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1516-89132008000500010&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en |accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common era==
A Finnish study [[assay]]ed psilocybin concentrations in old [[herbarium]] specimens, and concluded that although psilocybin concentration decreased linearly over time, it was relatively stable. They were able to detect the chemical in specimens that were 115 years old.&lt;ref name=Ohenoja1987&gt;{{cite journal |title=The occurrence of psilocybin and psilocin in Finnish fungi |journal=Journal of Natural Products |vauthors=Ohenoja E, Jokiranta J, Mäkinen T, Kaikkonen A, Airaksinen MM |year=1987 |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=741–44 |pmid=3430170 |doi=10.1021/np50052a030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maya, Olmecs, and Aztecs have well-documented entheogenic complexes. North American cultures also have a tradition of entheogens. In South America, especially in Peru, the archaeological study of cultures like Chavin, Cupisnique, Nasca and Moche, have demonstrated the use of entheogens through archaeobotanical, iconographic and paraphernalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharon|first1=Douglas | author-link1=Douglas Sharon|title=Shamanism &amp; the sacred cactus: ethnoarchaeological evidence for San Pedro use in northern Perú|date=2000|publisher=San Diego Museum of Man|location=San Diego|isbn=978-0937808740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Olmec entheogens===
The [[Olmec]] (12,000 BCE to 400 BCE) lived in Central America and are largely viewed by many as the mother culture of Aztecs and Maya. The Olmecs left no written works on their belief structures, so many interpretations on Olmec beliefs are largely based on interpretations of murals and artifacts. Archaeologists state three reasons for believing that the Olmecs used entheogens:

#Burials of [[Bufo|Bufo toads]] with priests
#The use of entheogens in later Olmec-inspired cultures
#Sculptures of shamans and other figures have strong [[Therianthrope|Therianthropic]] imagery.

===Maya===
The [[Maya civilization|Maya]] (250 BCE to 900 CE) flourished in Central America and were prevalent even until the arrival of the Spanish. The Maya religious tradition was complex and well-developed. Unlike the Olmec, the Maya had religious texts that survived to this day. The Maya religion displayed characteristic Mesoamerican mythology, with a strong emphasis on an individual being a communicator between the physical world and the spiritual world. Mushroom stone effigies, dated to 1000 BCE, give evidence that mushrooms were at least revered in a religious way.

The late Maya archaeologist, Dr Stephan F. de Borhegyi, (better known by his contemporaries as Borhegyi) published the first of several articles in which he proposed the existence of a Mesoamerican mushroom cult in the Guatemalan highlands as early as 1000 B.C  This cult, which was associated from its beginnings with ritual human decapitation, a trophy head cult, warfare and the Mesoamerican ballgame, appears to have had its origins along the Pacific coastal piedmont. Borhegyi developed this proposition after finding a significant number of small, mushroom-shaped sculptures in the collections of the Guatemala National Museum and in numerous private collections in and around Guatemala City. While the majority of these small stone sculptures were of indeterminate provenance, a sufficient number had been found during the course of archaeological investigations as to permit him to determine approximate dates and to catalog them stylistically (Borhegyi de, S.F., 1957b,  "Mushroom Stones of Middle America," in Mushrooms, Russia and History  by [[Valentina Pavlovna Wasson|Valentina P. Wasson]] and [[R. Gordon Wasson]], eds. N.T.)

Quoting archaeologist Stephan F. de Borhegyi:  
&lt;blockquote&gt;"My assignment for the so-called mushroom cult, earliest 1,000 B.C., is based on the excavations of  Kidder and  Shook at the Verbena cemetery at Kaminaljuyu. The mushroom stone found in this Pre-Classic grave, discovered in Mound E-III-3, has a circular groove on the cap. There are also a number of yet unpublished mushroom stone specimens in the Guatemalan Museum from Highland Guatemala where the pottery association would indicate that they are Pre-Classic. In each case the mushroom stone fragments has a circular groove on the top. Mushroom stones found during the Classic and Post-Classic periods do not have circular grooves. This was the basis on which I prepared the chart on mushroom stones which was then subsequently published by the Wassons. Based on Carbon 14 dates and stratigraphy, some of these  Pre-Classic finds can be dated as early as 1,000 B.C. The reference is in the following".....(see Shook, E.M. &amp; Kidder, A.V., 1952. Mound E-III-3, Kaminaljuyu, Guatemala; Contributions to American Anthropology &amp; History No. 53 from Publ. 596, Carnegie Institution of Washington, D.C. (letter from de Borhegyi to Dr. Robert Ravicz, MPM archives December 1st 1960 )&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The most direct evidence of Maya entheogen use comes from modern descendents of the Maya who use entheogenic drugs today.

===Aztec===
The [[Aztec entheogenic complex]] is extremely well documented. Through historical evidence, there is proof that the Aztecs used several forms of psychoactive drugs. These drugs include Ololiuqui (the seed of Rivea corymbosa), Teonanácatl (translated as “mushroom of the gods," a psilocybe mushroom) and sinicuichi (a flower added to drinks). The [[Xochipilli]] statue, according to R.G. Wasson, gives the identity of several entheogenic plants. Other evidence for entheogenic use of the Aztecs comes from the Florentine Codex, a series of 12 books vividly describing the Aztec culture and society, including the use of entheogenic drugs.

===Native Americans of the southwest United States===
There are several contemporary indigenous groups who use entheogens, most notably Native Americans of the southwest United States. Various tribes from California have been known to use strong alcoholic drinks as well as peyote to achieve visions and religious experiences.

==Old World==

=== Paleolithic===
During the [[Paleolithic]], there is ample evidence of drug use as seen by preserved botanical remains and coprolites. Some scholars had suggested that the "Flower Burial" in [[Shanidar Cave]], a Paleolithic site in Iraq, was evidence of a shamanic death ritual, but more recent evidence and analysis has contradicted that claim. The most direct evidence we have from the Paleolithic in terms of art comes from [[Tassili n'Ajjer|Tassili, Algeria]] cave paintings depicting ''[[Psilocybe mairei]]'' mushrooms&lt;ref name="New Scientist" /&gt; dated 7000 to 9000 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saromini|first1=Giorgio|title=The Oldest Representation of Hallucinogenic Mushrooms in the World|journal=Integration: Journal for Mind-Moving Plants and Culture|date=1992|volume=1|issue=2/3|url=http://www.samorini.it/doc1/sam/sam-1992-sahara.pdf|accessdate=18 September 2017}} Reprinted at [http://www.artepreistorica.com/2009/12/the-oldest-representations-of-hallucinogenic-mushrooms-in-the-world-sahara-desert-9000-%E2%80%93-7000-b-p/nggallery/thumbnails/ ArtePreistorica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; before present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guzman|first1=Gaston|title=New Taxonomical and Ethnomycological Observations on Psilocybe S.S.

There are several Paleolithic sites that display therianthropic imagery. However, there is some debate as to whether or not sites like Lascaux or Chauvet were entheogenically inspired.

The '''European Software Institute''' (ESI) is a division of [[Tecnalia]] with its headquarters in Spain.

One of the early "products" of the institute was a methodology for analyzing and improving processes in software-producing organisations which then became a standard [[ISO/IEC 15504]] with the popular name "SPICE". This standard was the European "answer" to the [[Capability Maturity Model Integration]] (CMMI)  methodology having been developed at the [[Software Engineering Institute]] at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, US, which today is an institute being in "co-optition" with ESI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sei.cmu.edu/partners/esi/ | title=European Software Institute | publisher=SEI | accessdate=August 4, 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18310">The '''FM broadcast band''', used for [[FM broadcasting|FM]] [[Radio broadcasting|broadcast radio]] by [[radio station]]s, differs between different parts of the world. In Europe, Australia&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acma.gov.au/webwr/_assets/main/lib550024/attach_a1-chptr_1-general_information-26sept2012.docx.&lt;/ref&gt; and Africa ((defined as [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) [[ITU region|region]] 1)), it spans from 87.5 to 108 [[hertz#SI multiples|megahertz]] (MHz) - also known as VHF [[Band II]] - while in the Americas (ITU region 2) it ranges from 88 to 108&amp;nbsp;MHz. The FM broadcast band in [[Japan]] uses 76 to 95&amp;nbsp;MHz. The [[International Radio and Television Organisation]] (OIRT) band in [[Eastern Europe]] is from 65.8 to 74.0&amp;nbsp;MHz, although these countries now primarily use the 87.5 to 108&amp;nbsp;MHz band, as in the case of [[Russia]]. Some other countries have already discontinued the OIRT band and have changed to the 87.5 to 108&amp;nbsp;MHz band.

[[Frequency modulation]] radio originated in the [[United States]] during the 1930s; the system was developed by the American [[electrical engineer]] [[Edwin Howard Armstrong]]. However, FM broadcasting did not become widespread, even in [[North America]], until the 1960s.

Frequency-modulated radio waves can be generated at any frequency. All the bands mentioned in this article are in the [[very high frequency]] (VHF) range, which extends from 30 to 300&amp;nbsp;MHz.

==CCIR bandplan==

===Center frequencies===
While all countries use FM channel center frequencies ending in 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9&amp;nbsp;MHz, some countries also use center frequencies ending in 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8&amp;nbsp;MHz. A few others also use 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, 0.55, 0.65, 0.75, 0.85, and 0.95&amp;nbsp;MHz.

An [[ITU-R|ITU]] conference in [[Geneva, Switzerland]], on December 7, 1984, resolved to discontinue the use of 50&amp;nbsp;kHz channel spacings throughout [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukspec.tripod.com/specbw.html#b87|title=UK Radio Frequency Bands|author=|date=|website=ukspec.tripod.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Most countries have used 100&amp;nbsp;kHz or 200&amp;nbsp;kHz channel spacings for FM broadcasting since this ITU conference in 1984.
* Some digitally-tuned FM radios are unable to tune using 50&amp;nbsp;kHz or even 100&amp;nbsp;kHz increments. Therefore, when traveling abroad, stations that broadcast on certain frequencies using such increments may not be heard clearly. This problem will not affect reception on an analog-tuned radio.
* A few countries, such as [[Italy]], which have heavily congested FM bands, still allow a station on any multiple of 50&amp;nbsp;kHz wherever one can be squeezed in.
* The 50&amp;nbsp;kHz channel spacings help prevent [[co-channel interference|co-channel]] [[electromagnetic interference|interference]], and these take advantage of FM's [[capture effect]] and [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]].

===ITU Region 2 bandplan and channel numbering===
The original frequency allocation in [[North America]] used by [[Edwin Armstrong]] used the frequency band from 42 through 50&amp;nbsp;MHz, but this allocation was changed to a higher band beginning in 1945. In [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[Mexico]], [[the Bahamas]], etc., there are 101 [[List of channel numbers assigned to FM frequencies in North America|FM channels]] numbered from ''200'' (center frequency 87.9&amp;nbsp;MHz) to ''300'' (center frequency 107.9&amp;nbsp;MHz), though these numbers are rarely used outside the fields of [[radio engineering]] and government.
 
The center frequencies of the FM channels are spaced in increments of 200&amp;nbsp;kHz. The frequency of 87.9&amp;nbsp;MHz, while technically part of TV channel 6 (82 to 88&amp;nbsp;MHz), is used by just two [[list of broadcast station classes|FM class-D]] stations in the United States. Portable radio [[tuner (radio)|tuner]]s often tune down to 87.5&amp;nbsp;MHz, so that the same radios can be made and sold worldwide. [[Automobile]]s usually have FM radios that can tune down to 87.7&amp;nbsp;MHz, so that TV channel 6's audio at 87.75&amp;nbsp;MHz (±10&amp;nbsp;kHz) could be received, such as in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], and [[Denver, Colorado]]. With the advent of [[digital television]] in the United States, this ability will soon be irrelevant when the remaining analog LPTV stations are required by the FCC to shut down or convert to digital by September 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/guides/dtv-transition-and-lptv-class-translator-stations|title=DTV Transition and LPTV - Class A - Translator Stations|author=|date=24 May 2011|website=fcc.gov|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;—but there are still [[analog television]] stations in the sparsely-populated regions of northern Canada. There are also analog TV stations on the other continents and on scores of different islands.

In the United States, the twenty-one channels with center frequencies of 87.9–91.9&amp;nbsp;MHz (channels 200 through 220) constitute the ''[[reserved band]]'', exclusively for [[non-commercial educational]] (''NCE'') stations. The other channels (92.1&amp;nbsp;MHz through 107.9&amp;nbsp;MHz (Channels 221–300) may be used by both commercial and non-commercial stations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fcc.gov/topic/fm-radio&lt;/ref&gt; (Note that in Canada and in Mexico this reservation does not apply.)

Originally, the American [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) devised a [[bandplan]] in which FM radio stations would be assigned at intervals of four channels (800&amp;nbsp;kHz separation) for any one geographic area. Thus, in one area, stations might be at 88.1, 88.9, 89.7, etc., while in an adjacent area, stations might be at 88.3, 89.1, 89.9, 90.7 etc. Certain frequencies were designated for Class A only (see [[FM broadcasting]]), which had a limit of three [[kilowatt]]s of [[effective radiated power]] (ERP) and an [[radio antenna|antenna]] height limit for the center of radiation of 300 feet (91.4 m) height above average terrain ([[HAAT]]). These frequencies were 92.1, 92.7, 93.5, 94.3, 95.3, 95.9, 96.7, 97.7, 98.3, 99.3, 100.1, 100.9, 101.7, 102.3, 103.1, 103.9, 104.9, 105.5, 106.3 and 107.1. On other frequencies, a station could be Class B (50&amp;nbsp;kW, 500 feet) or Class C (100&amp;nbsp;kW, 2000 feet), depending on which zone it was in.

In the late 1980s, the FCC switched to a bandplan based on a distance separation table using currently operating stations, and subdivided the class table to create extra classes and change antenna height limits to meters. Class A power was doubled to six kilowatts, and the frequency restrictions noted above were removed. As of late 2004, a station can be "squeezed in" anywhere as long as the location and class conform to the rules in the FCC separation table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/spacing/|title=separation table|author=|date=|website=fcc.gov|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules for second-adjacent-channel spacing do not apply for stations licensed before 1964.

===Deviation and bandpass===
Normally each [[channel (communications)|channel]] is 200&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|kHz]] (0.2&amp;nbsp;MHz) wide, and can pass [[Broadcasting|audio]] and [[subcarrier]] frequencies up to 100&amp;nbsp;kHz. [[Frequency deviation|Deviation]] is typically limited to 150&amp;nbsp;kHz total (±75&amp;nbsp;kHz) in order to prevent [[adjacent channel interference]] on the band. Stations in the U.S. may go up to 10% over this limit if they use non-stereo [[subcarrier]]s, increasing total [[modulation]] by 0.5% for each 1% used by the subcarriers.

==OIRT bandplan==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[OIRT bandplan]] --&gt;
The [[OIRT]] FM broadcast band covers 65.9 to 74&amp;nbsp;MHz. It was used in the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] and most of the other [[Warsaw pact]] member countries of the [[International Radio and Television Organisation]] in  [[Eastern Europe]] (OIRT), with the exception of [[East Germany]], which always used the 87.5 to 100 (later 104) MHz broadcast band—in line with Western Europe.

The [[Band I|lower portion of the VHF band]] [[Radio propagation|behaves]] a bit like [[shortwave radio]] in that it has a longer reach than the upper portion of the VHF band.  It was ideally suited for reaching vast and remote areas that would otherwise lack FM radio reception. In a way, FM suited this band because the capture effect of FM could mitigate interference from [[skywave]]s.

Following the collapse of the communist governments in Eastern Europe, the 87.5 to 108&amp;nbsp;MHz band began to be adopted and is now in use in all those countries. This was prompted by the lack of equipment for the band and the modernisation of existing transmission networks.

Many countries have completely ceased broadcasting on the OIRT FM band, although use continues in others, mainly the former republics of the USSR. The future of broadcasting on the OIRT FM band is limited, due to the lack of new consumer receivers for this band outside of Russia.

Countries which still use the OIRT band are [[Russia]] (including [[Kaliningrad]]), [[Belarus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvr.by/eng/radio/1-kanal/|title=1 канал. Первый национальный канал Белорусского радио|author=|date=|website=www.tvr.by|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moldova]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Code/2523/mdfmlist.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+09:47:57 http://www.egocities.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ukraine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiofm.narod.ru/fmair.html|title=FM,УКВ-радиостанции в Украине|author=|date=|website=www.radiofm.narod.ru|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Turkmenistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukradio.info/OIRT_Tuner/|title=OIRT Tuner|author=|date=|website=ukradio.info|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hungary closed down its remaining broadcast transmitters in 2007, and for thirty days in July of that year, several Hungarian amateur radio operators received a temporary experimental permit to perform propagation and interference experiments in the 70–70.5&amp;nbsp;MHz band.

In Belarus, only government-run public radio stations are still active on OIRT. All stations on OIRT in Belarus are a mirror of normal FM broadcasts. The main purpose of those stations is compatibility with older equipment.

In 2014, Russia began replacing OIRT-banded transmitter with CCIR-banded (the "western") FM transmitters. The main reason for the change to CCIR FM is to reach more listeners.

Unlike Western practice, OIRT FM frequencies are based on 30&amp;nbsp;kHz rather than 50, 100 or 200&amp;nbsp;kHz multiples. This may have been to reduce co-channel interference caused by [[Sporadic E propagation]] and other atmospheric effects, which occur more often at these frequencies. However, multipath distortion effects are less annoying than on the CCIR band.

Stereo is generally achieved by sending the stereo difference signal, using a process called [[polar modulation]]. Polar modulation uses a reduced subcarrier on 31.25&amp;nbsp;kHz with the audio on both side-bands. This gives the following signal structure: L + R --&gt; 31.25&amp;nbsp;kHz reduced subcarrier L - R.

The [[4-meter band]] (70–70.5&amp;nbsp;MHz) [[amateur radio]] allocation used in many European countries is entirely within the OIRT FM band. Operators on this band and the [[6-meter band]] (50–54&amp;nbsp;MHz) use the presence of broadcast stations as an indication that there is an "opening" into Eastern Europe or Russia. This can be a mixed blessing because the 4&amp;nbsp;meter amateur allocation is only 0.5&amp;nbsp;MHz or less, and a single broadcast station causes considerable interference to a large part of the band.

The [[Television channel frequencies#Eastern Europe|System D]] television channels R4 and R5 lie wholly or partly within the 87.5–108&amp;nbsp;MHz FM audio broadcast band. Countries which still use System D therefore have to consider the re-organisation of TV broadcasting in order to make full use of this band for audio broadcasting.

==Japanese bandplan==
{{See also|FM broadcasting in Japan}}
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The FM band in Japan is 76–95&amp;nbsp;MHz (previously 76–90). The 90–108&amp;nbsp;MHz section was used for analog VHF TV Channels 1, 2 and 3 (each [[NTSC]] television channel was 6&amp;nbsp;MHz wide). The narrowness of the Japanese band (19&amp;nbsp;MHz compared to slightly more than 20&amp;nbsp;MHz for the CCIR band) limits the number of FM stations that can be accommodated on the dial with the result that many commercial radio stations are forced to use [[AM broadcasting|AM]]. 

Many Japanese radios are capable of receiving both the Japanese FM band and the CCIR FM band, so that the same model can be sold within Japan or exported. The radio may cover 76 to 108&amp;nbsp;MHz, the frequency coverage may be selectable by the user, or during assembly the radio may be set to operate on one band by means of a specially placed diode or other internal component.

Conventional analog-tuned (dial &amp; pointer) radios may be marked with "TV Sound" in the 90–108 section. If these radios were sold in the US, for example, the 76–88 section would be marked TV sound for VHF channels 5 and 6 (as two 6&amp;nbsp;MHz-wide NTSC TV channels), with the 88–108 section band as normal FM.

Second-hand automobiles imported from Japan contain a radio designed for the Japanese FM band, and importers often fit a "converter" to down-convert the 87.5 to 107.9&amp;nbsp;MHz band to the frequencies that the radio can accept. In addition to showing an incorrect frequency, there are two other disadvantages that can result in undesired performance; the converter cannot down-convert in full the regular international FM band (up to 20.5&amp;nbsp;MHz wide) to the only 14&amp;nbsp;MHz-wide Japanese band (unless the converter incorporates two user-switchable down-convert modes), and the car's [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] may perform poorly on the higher FM band. Some converters simply down-convert the FM band by 12&amp;nbsp;MHz, leading to logical frequencies (e.g. 78.9 for 90.9, 82.3 for 94.3, etc.), but leaving off the 102–108&amp;nbsp;MHz band. Also, [[Radio Data System|RDS]] is not used in Japan, whereas most modern car radios available in Europe have this system. Also the converter may not allow pass-through of the [[Medium wave|MW band]], which is used for AM broadcasting. A better solution is to replace the radio and antenna with ones designed for the country where the car will be used.
 
[[Australia]] had a similar situation with Australian TV channels 3, 4 and 5 that are between 88 and 108&amp;nbsp;MHz, and was intending to follow Japan, but in the end opted for the western bandplan, due to CCIR radios that entered the country. There were some radios sold in Australia for 76 to 90&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;This was taught at the [[TAFE|TAFE college]] Audio course of the electronic servicing certificate, and it is also part of the long story of the introduction of FM radio in Australia, which can be found in older Australian electronics magazines.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic U.S. bandplan==
Early FM broadcasting in North America originally used the 42–50&amp;nbsp;MHz band&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wa2ise.com/radios/fm45.html  Regarding the 42—50&amp;nbsp;MHz FM band and the switchover] Accessed 2010-08-28&lt;/ref&gt; (this range was also used by a class of experimental wideband AM stations known as [[apex (radio band)|apex broadcasters]]). In 1941, the [[Yankee Network]], which was already using FM for AM station [[Feed (broadcasting)|feeds]], started operating a station, [[W39B]], in this band from a transmitter atop [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]], [[New Hampshire]], the highest point in the northeast United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mountwashington.org/about/visitor/history/, retrieved 10-08-2014.&lt;/ref&gt; (Studios were in Boston.) In 1945 the United States [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] decided to move FM broadcasters to the 88.1–105.9&amp;nbsp;MHz band (later extended to 107.9&amp;nbsp;MHz); this made all the existing FM radios useless, although converters could be purchased. It was even more expensive for broadcasters to rebuild their transmitters to work on the new band. Altogether, the change set FM radio back ten years.

The "devastating" change was successfully lobbied for (with the FCC) by [[RCA]], which did not want FM radio to become dominant, although the higher frequencies had fewer interference problems. RCA conducted "an organized campaign of misinformation". This protected RCA's and other networks' investments in [[AM radio]], and avoided competition with [[television]], which RCA wanted to focus on.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin Howard Armstrong#FM radio]], [[FM broadcasting in the United States]], [[Yankee Network]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, the FCC requested public comment on turning the bandwidth currently occupied by analog television channels 5 and 6 (76–88&amp;nbsp;MHz) over to extending the FM broadcast band when the digital television transition was to be completed in February 2009 (ultimately delayed to June 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regulations.gov/fdmspublic/component/main?main=DocumentDetail&amp;o=090000648064a653|title=In the Matter of Promoting Diversification of Ownership in the Broadcasting Services|author=Federal Communications Commission|date=2008-05-16|accessdate=2008-08-26|quote=Certain commenters have urged the Commission to give a "hard look" to a proposal that the Commission re-allocate TV Channels 5 and 6 for FM broadcasting}}  {{USFR|73|28400}}, 28403&lt;/ref&gt; This proposed allocation would effectively assign frequencies corresponding to the existing Japanese FM radio service (which begins at 76&amp;nbsp;MHz) for use as an extension to the existing North American FM broadcast band.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioworld.com/article/67266 Could EXB Band Be Your New Home?]''RadioWorld'' September 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==FM radio switch-off==
With the invention of [[Digital audio broadcasting|DAB+]] radio, some countries have planned and started a [[Digital audio broadcasting#FM radio switch-off|FM radio switch-off]]. [[Norway]], in January 2018, was the first country to discontinue FM as a result.

{{Fantasy}}
A '''fantasy world''' is a human conceived world created in fictional media, such as literature, film or games.  Typical fantasy worlds involve magic or magical abilities, nonexistent technology&lt;ref&gt;Brian Attebery, ''The Fantasy Tradition in American Literature'', pp. 166–7, {{ISBN|0-253-35665-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes, either a [[historical]] or [[futuristic]] theme. Some worlds may be a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] connected to [[Earth]] via magical portals or items (like [[Narnia]]); a fictional Earth set in the remote past or future (like [[Middle-earth]]); or an entirely independent world set in another part of the universe (like the [[Star Wars]] Galaxy).&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Imaginary lands", pp. 495–5 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, sociology, mythology, and folklore.

==Plot function==
The setting of a fantasy work is often of great importance to the plot and characters of the story. The setting itself can be imperiled by the evil of the story, suffer a calamity, and be restored by the transformation the story brings about.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Land", p. 558 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stories that use the setting as merely a backdrop for the story have been criticized for their failure to use it fully.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Fantasyland", p. 341 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when the land itself is not in danger, it is often used symbolically, for thematic purposes, and to underscore moods.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Moorcock, Wizardry &amp; Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy pp. 72–3 {{ISBN|1-932265-07-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Early fantasy worlds appeared as fantasy ''lands'', part of the same planet but separated by geographical barriers.  For example, [[Land of Oz|Oz]], though a fantasy world in every way, is described as part of this world.&lt;ref name="John Clute p 739"&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Oz", p. 739 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although medieval peasants who seldom if ever traveled far from their villages could not conclusively say that it was impossible that, for example, an [[ogre]] could live a day's travel away, distant continents were necessary from the [[Renaissance]] onwards for such fantastic speculation to be plausible, until finally, further exploration rendered all such terrestrial fantasy lands implausible.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. S. Lewis]], "On Science Fiction", ''Of Other Worlds'', p. 68 {{ISBN|0-15-667897-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even within the span of mere decades, Oz, which had been situated in a desert in the United States when first written about in 1900,&lt;ref name="John Clute p 739"/&gt; was relocated to a spot in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. 99, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of the fantasy land/world concept can be seen in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''), where places of which little was known, but where the occurrence of marvels was thus more credible, had to be set "long ago" or "far away". This is a process that continues, and finally culminates in the fantasy world having little connection, if any, to actual times and places.&lt;ref name="arabianNights2"&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Arabian fantasy", p 52 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent example of a fantasy land with definite connections to the actual world is Austin Tappan Wright's [[Islandia (novel)|Islandia]]. Islandia's remoteness and aura of mystery, as well as its preservation of an [[Arcadia (utopia)|arcadian]] society, are explained by means of a law which allows only limited contact with foreigners.

[[Dream world (plot device)|Dream frames]] were also once common for encasing the fantasy world with an explanation of its marvels. Such a dream frame was added to the story of ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' for the movie version; in the book, Oz is clearly defined as an actual place.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p 96, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[H.P. Lovecraft]] made active use of the dream frame, creating elaborate geographies accessible to humans only when they were asleep and dreaming. These dream-settings have been criticized,&lt;ref&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien, "On Fairy-Stories", p. 14, ''The Tolkien Reader'', Ballantine Books, New York 1966&lt;/ref&gt; and are far less frequent today.

This change is part of a general trend toward more self-consistent and substantive fantasy worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Manlove, ''Christian Fantasy: from 1200 to the Present'' p 210 {{ISBN|0-268-00790-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has also altered the nature of the plots; earlier works often feature a solitary individual whose adventures in the fantasy world are of personal significance, and where the world clearly exists to give scope to these adventures, and later works more often feature characters in a social web, where their actions are to save the world and those in it from peril.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Manlove, ''Christian Fantasy: from 1200 to the Present'' p. 211–2 {{ISBN|0-268-00790-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common elements==
The most common fantasy world is one based on medieval Europe, and has been since [[William Morris]] used it in his early fantasy works, such as ''[[The Well at the World's End]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Waggoner, ''The Hills of Faraway: A Guide to Fantasy'', p 37, {{ISBN|0-689-10846-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly since the 1954 publication of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Such a world is often called "pseudo-medieval"—particularly when the writer has snatched up random elements from the era, which covered a thousand years and a continent, and thrown them together without consideration for their compatibility, or even introduced ideas not so much based on the medieval era as on [[Medievalism|romanticized views]] of it. When these worlds are copied not so much from history as from other fantasy works, there is a heavy tendency to uniformity and lack of realism.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant, "[http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/gulliver.htm Gulliver Unravels: Generic Fantasy and the Loss of Subversion]"&lt;/ref&gt; The full width and breadth of the medieval era is seldom drawn upon. Governments, for instance, tend to be uncompromisingly feudal-based, or evil empires or [[oligarchies]], usually corrupt, while there was far more variety of rule in the actual Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Alec Austin, [http://www.strangehorizons.com/2002/20020624/epic_fantasy.shtml "Quality in Epic Fantasy"]&lt;/ref&gt; Fantasy worlds also tend to be medieval in economy, and disproportionately [[pastoral]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane Yolen]], "Introduction" p viii ''After the King: Stories in Honor of J.R.R. Tolkien'', ed, Martin H. Greenberg, {{ISBN|0-312-85175-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Careful world-building plus meticulous attention to detail is often cited as the reason why certain fantasy works are deeply convincing and contain a magical sense of place.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Martin, ''The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Lair to Hero's Quest'', p. 113, {{ISBN|0-87116-195-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Heavy and faithful use of real world setting for inspiration, as in [[Barry Hughart]]'s ''[[Bridge of Birds]]'', clearly derived from China, or [[Lloyd Alexander]]'s use of real world cultures such as Welsh for ''[[The Chronicles of Prydain]]'' or Indian for ''[[The Iron Ring]]'', make the line between fantasy worlds and [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternate histories]] fuzzy. The use of cultural elements, and still more history and geography, from actual settings pushes a work toward alternative history.

Conversely, the creation by an author of an imaginary country—such as [[Ruritania]] or [[Graustark]]—does not automatically transform that imaginary country into a fantasy world, even if the location would be impossible in reality owing to a lack of land to contain it; but such [[Ruritanian romance]]s may be pushed toward the category of fantasy worlds by the introduction of, say, witches and wise women, where it is not clear if their magic is effectual.&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Sprague de Camp]], ''[[Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers]]: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', p. 6 {{ISBN|0-87054-076-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lin Carter in ''[[Imaginary Worlds – the Art of Fantasy|Imaginary Worlds: the Art of Fantasy]]'', fantasy worlds, by their nature, contain some element of [[magic (paranormal)]]. This element may be the creatures in it ([[dragon]]s, [[unicorn]]s, [[genie]]s and so on) or the magical abilities of the people inhabiting the world. These are often drawn from [[mythology]] and [[folklore]], frequently that of the historical country also used for inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Lin, ''Imaginary Worlds, the Art of Fantasy''. Ballantine, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constructed worlds==
{{further|Constructed world}}
[[File:Tolkien The two trees.jpg|right|thumb|The Creation of the Two Trees figured in Tolkien's fantasy world, [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]]]]
Fantasy worlds created through a process called [[world building]] are known as a [[constructed world]]. Constructed worlds elaborate and make self-consistent the setting of a fantasy work. World building often relies on materials and concepts taken from the real world.

Despite the use of magic or other fantastic elements such as dragons, the world is normally presented as one that would function normally, one in which people could actually live, making economic, historical, and ecological sense. It is considered a flaw to have, for example, pirates living in lands far from trade routes, or to assign prices for a night's stay in an inn that would equate to several years’ income.

Furthermore, the fantastic elements should ideally operate according to self-consistent rules of their own; for example, if wizards' spells sap their strength, a wizard who does not appear to suffer this must either be putting up a facade, or have an alternative explanation. This distinguishes fantasy worlds from surrealism and even from such dream worlds as are found in ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''.

===Examples===
*[[L. Frank Baum]] created the [[Land of Oz]] for his novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' and its original sequels. He was one of the few authors before Tolkien to use consistent internal geographies and histories to enrich his world.
*[[C. S. Lewis]], author of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'', set that series' novels mostly in a magical land called [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]]. Lewis was a colleague of Tolkien, and their fictional worlds share several key elements.
*[[Terry Pratchett]] created [[Discworld (world)|Discworld]], a large disc resting on the backs of four huge elephants, which are in turn standing on the back of an enormous turtle, as it slowly swims through space.
*[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] created [[Middle-earth]], possibly the most famous fantasy world. He introduced several revolutionary concepts to fantasy fiction and popularized the idea of intricately detailed fantasy worlds. He wrote at some length about the process, which he called "sub-creation". Middle-earth is intended to be Earth's [[Old World]] in a fictional ancient era.
*[[George R. R. Martin]] created a [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire|fictional world]] for his novel series ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''. Martin said in 2003 that complete world maps were deliberately not made available so that readers may better identify with people of the real Middle Ages who were unilluminated about distant places. Most of the story is set in the western continent of Westeros, though some is set in the Eastern continent Essos. The Southern continent of Sothoryos is also shown on maps, with a possible fourth continent, Ulthos, to its East. A map of the world is shown in the [[Game of Thrones title sequence|title sequence]] of the [[HBO]] TV adaptation, ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.

==Fairytale and comic fantasy==
[[Fairytale fantasy]] may ignore the normal world-building in order to present a world operating by the same logic as the fairytales from which they are derived, though other works in this subgenre develop their worlds fully.  [[Comic fantasy]] may ignore all possible logic in search of humor, particularly if it is parodying other fantasies' faulty world-building, as in [[Diana Wynne Jones]]'s ''[[Dark Lord of Derkholm]]'', or the illogic of the setting is integral to the comedy, as in [[L. Sprague de Camp]]'s ''[[Solomon's Stone]]'', where the fantasy world is populated by the heroic and glamorous figures that people daydream about being, resulting in a severe shortage of workers in the more mundane, day-to-day industries. Most other [[Fantasy subgenres|subgenres of fantasy]] suffer if the world-building is neglected.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== The retreat of magic ==
Rather than creating their own fantasy world, many authors choose to set their novels in Earth's past. In order to explain the absence of miraculous elements, authors may introduce "a retreat of magic" (sometimes called "thinning") that explains why the [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and other fantastic elements no longer appear:&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Thinning", p. 942 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the destruction of the [[One Ring]] defeated Sauron, but also destroyed the power of the [[Three Rings]] of the [[elves]], resulting in them sailing to the West at the end of the story. A [[contemporary fantasy]] necessarily takes place in what purports to be the real world, and not a fantasy world. It may, however, include references to such a retreat. [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' explains that wizards eventually decided to conceal all magic creatures and artifacts from non-magic users.

==Role-playing games==
''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', the first major [[role-playing game]], has created several detailed and commercially successful fantasy worlds (called "[[campaign setting]]s"), with established characters, locations, histories, and sociologies. The [[Forgotten Realms]] is perhaps the most extensively developed of these worlds. These elements of detail can be a large part of what attracts people to RPGs.

Many established fantasy writers have also derided ''Dungeons and Dragons'' and the fantasy fiction it has inspired due to its influencing new writers toward reading the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons [[Monster Manual]]'' instead of studying the original literature and mythology from which modern fantasy literature has sprung.

Due to the fuzzy boundary between fantasy and [[science fiction]], it is similarly difficult to make a hard-and-fast distinction between "fantasy worlds" and [[planets in science fiction]]. For example, the worlds of [[Barsoom]], [[Darkover]], [[Gor]], and the [[Witch World]] combine elements of both genres.

The '''Forest Products Laboratory''' (FPL) is the national research laboratory of the [[United States Forest Service]], which is part of [[USDA]]. Since its opening in 1910, the FPL has provided scientific research on wood, wood products and their commercial uses in partnership with academia, industry, tribal, state, local and other government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-6309544/Forest-Products-Laboratory-supporting-|title=Find Local Contractors - Home Remodeling Contractors on Ecnext|website=goliath.ecnext.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The laboratory is headquartered in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].  The focus of the Forest Products Laboratory is to promote healthy forests and forest-based economies through the efficient, sustainable use of the Nation's wood resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/atlas_obscura/2017/01/12/the_forest_products_laboratory_is_a_federally_funded_lab_conducting_experiments.html|title=The Federally Funded Laboratory Conducting Experiments on All Things Wooden|date=12 January 2017|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Old U.S. Forest Products Lab.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Old U.S. Forest Products Laboratory|old Forest Products Laboratory]] (1910) on the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] campus, at 1509 University Avenue, is also listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].]]
[[File:Forest Products Building, U.S. Government, taken from the Lake Drive, Madison, Wisconsin (63064).jpg|thumb|250px|The new Laboratory location, illustrated between the 1930s and 40s]]
The Forest Products Laboratory was conceived of in 1907 by McGarvey Cline, chief of the U.S. Forest Service Office of Wood Utilization. Cline saw the need for a centralized research facility in order to improve coordination among regional research centers.  Along with Forest Service Chief [[Gifford Pinchot]], Cline selected the [[University of Wisconsin]] campus as the site for this new laboratory. Operations began at 1509 University Avenue, in what today is the UW Materials Science and Engineering Building.  The dedication ceremony occurred under new Chief [[Henry S. Graves]] on June 4, 1910.  [[Raphael Zon]]'s advocacy of research led to the organization of the first Federal Forest Experiment Stations and the Forest Products Laboratory under the Branch of Research, which was formed in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fhsarchives.wordpress.com/2008/12/01/december-1-1874-a-red-star-is-born/|title=December 1, 1874: A [Red] Star is Born|date=1 December 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fseee.org/forest-magazine/200061&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, the Forest Products Laboratory began relocation to its current facility on the western end of the University of Wisconsin campus. 
 
Research at the FPL has improved quality of life for nearly every American by facilitating breakthroughs in housing, packaging, recycling, and conservation of forest resources. The FPL has also made numerous important contributions to the country during its history, including crucial research for the armed forces during times of war.&lt;ref&gt;Risbrudt, C.D., Ross, R.J., Blankenburg, J.J., Nelson, C.A. (2007). Forest Products Laboratory: Supporting the Nation's Armed Forces with valuable wood research for 90 years. Forest Products Journal, Vol. 57(1&amp;2), pp. 6-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The mission of the Forest Products Laboratory is to identify and conduct innovative wood and fiber utilization research that contributes to conservation and productivity of the forest resource, thereby sustaining forests, the economy, and quality of life. The FPL is organized into seven primary Research Work Units. These units utilize the testing resources of several laboratories and informational repositories located within numerous FPL campus facilities. Five primary Areas of Focus are the center of all FPL research. Collaboration on this research takes place with various other Federal agencies; state, local, and tribal governments; private industry and academic institutions.

===Research Emphasis Areas===

*'''Underutilized Woody Biomass''': Forests in the United States contain a significant amount of small-diameter and underutilized woody [[biomass]]. Overstocked stands of trees increase the risk of catastrophic wildfires and damage due to insects, disease, and drought. Thinning these stands can help reduce risks but can be very costly and may exceed the value of the biomass being removed. The commercial use of thinning material creates a market for [[value-added]] products and is one way to improve the economics of thinning operations aimed at improving forest health. Since 1993, the Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) has focused some of its many research efforts on characterizing and identifying potential uses for small-diameter and thinning material. FPL researchers also provide technology to help rural communities create successful businesses from the by-products of [[ecosystem management]]. Some projects have explored the potential of "in the round" form small-diameter structural material for uses in bridges, boardwalks, trail structures, picnic shelters, storage sheds, and other rustic-type buildings.
*'''Nanotechnology''': [[Nanotechnology]] research presents great potential for improved wood product performance and serviceability. As such, the FPL is poised to be the preeminent Federal facility for the application of nano-science in forest products research. Potential nanotech applications include wood composite materials with embedded nanosensors to measure and react to structural forces, loads, moisture, and temperatures. Nano-enabled antimicrobial and water resistant coatings on lumber for use in flood-prone areas and hurricane zones could improve health, safety, and wood resiliency in these areas. The development of high-value products from undervalued wood resources using cellulose [[nanocrystal]]s and nanofibrilated cellulose components can also improve the performance and durability of [[fiberboard]], [[particleboard]], and glued structural products for use in a wide array of structural applications.
*'''Forest Biorefinery and Biomass Utilization''': The FPL is well-placed to pursue research opportunities to improve the economics of producing transportation fuel, [[bioenergy]], and chemicals from woody [[biomass]]. Development of profitable biorefineries helps lower the cost of [[forest management]], improves forest health, advances sustainable forest management practices, reduces dependence on fossil fuels, and decreases production of [[greenhouse gases]]. Decades of [[fire suppression]] have disrupted the natural fire cycle of U.S. forests, resulting in an estimated 8.4 billion dry tons of material that needs to be removed from the National Forests to improve their resiliency.  This material is available for production of wood products, chemicals, and energy, yet profitable uses for the material are needed to reduce the costs of [[forest management]]. Business concepts that focus on converting wood resources into liquid fuels and chemical feedstock are becoming cost competitive.  As international concerns over [[global warming]] and [[greenhouse gas]] generation rise, governmental support for [[biofuels]] is increasing and likely reduces investment risks. Fuels derived from biomass are generally regarded as greenhouse gas neutral because the amount of carbon dioxide released on combustion equals the amount adsorbed from the atmosphere and sequestered by the plant through [[photosynthesis]].
*'''Advanced Structures Research''': In the past, structures were primarily designed based on life and safety issues. Today, structural design also includes functionality, [[Environmental impact assessment|environmental impact]], and economics. Performance-based engineering encompasses these considerations in [[structural design]] and is gaining momentum with architects and engineers. Performance-based engineering implies design, evaluation, and construction of engineered facilities that meet uncertain future demands.  The concepts require a shift away from empirical and experience-based conventions towards a design and assessment process more firmly rooted in accurate prediction of structural performance under a realistic description environmental loading factors that the structure experiences. This approach also emphasizes monitoring the health of the structural system, evaluating performance characteristics and identifying the need for renovation or new construction. It forms the foundation of strategies for revitalizing our decaying infrastructure.	
*'''Advanced Composites''': For decades, wood [[composite materials]] have been used to create [[value-added]] commodity building and home furnishing products (for example, [[plywood]], [[particleboard]], [[fiberboard]], [[hardboard]]). More recently, biobased composite products based on natural fibers, and hybrid products, such as wood–plastic composites, have come on the market.  New composite technologies, such as nano-enabled composites, are being developed as low-volume, high-value composites. Each of these technologies adds considerable value to diverse wood- and bio-fiber feedstocks, including small-diameter timber, plantation-grown timber, agricultural and industrial residues, exotic–invasive species, and demolition and recycled materials. Biobased composites are also an outlet for timber removals and thinning, which helps forest managers restore damaged ecosystems and promotes sustainable [[forest management]] practices. Recent advances in wood and [[biocomposite]] research have led to a new understanding between materials, process, and composite performance. Advances in engineered biocomposites impact a wide range of composite products, including economical commodity products and high-performance niche products.

===Research Work Units===

*'''Durability &amp; Wood Protection''': Improving durability and wood protection through improved building design, advances in low-toxicity wood preservatives, and improvements in fire safety.
*'''Economics &amp; Statistics''': Providing economic information, analysis, and projections and to enhance the efficiency of research through development, evaluation, and application of modern statistical research.
*'''Engineered Composites Sciences''': Understanding relationships between materials, process, and performance to engineer biocomposites that benefit users while promoting sustainability of both virgin and recycled forest resources.
*'''Engineering Properties of Wood, Wood-based Materials &amp; Structures''': Improving the characterization of the mechanical and physical properties of wood and wood-based products that are important in engineering design and fostering their efficient use in wood building systems.
*'''Fiber &amp; Chemical Sciences Research''': Formulating efficient processes for converting wood to chemicals and fibers, developing economically viable uses for underutilized wood resources, and improving methods for recovering and reusing forest products such as waste paper and construction debris.
*'''Institute for Microbial &amp; Biochemical Technology''': Developing biotechnology and nanotechnology for wood and fiber conversion through research that contributes to efficient wood utilization and improved forest health.
*'''Forest Biopolymer Science &amp; Engineering''': Understanding the basic properties of wood and other materials used in conjunction with wood to improve their properties, enhance their service life, and develop new uses.

===Laboratory Units===

*'''Analytical Chemistry &amp; Microscopy Laboratory''' (ACML): The ACML provides high-quality analytical support and technical consultation to FPL researchers using specialized equipment and capabilities, such as a [[nanoindenter]], [[atomic force microscope]] and [[scanning electron microscope]].
*'''Engineering Mechanics &amp; Remote Sensing Laboratory''' (EMRSL): The EMRSL conducts physical and mechanical tests on a wide range of materials, building systems, and structures for use in the development of [[building codes]] and [[structural design]]. Testing of products and structures can involve samples ranging in size from toothpicks to full structural beams to three-dimensional building mock-ups.
*'''Paper Test Laboratory''': The Paper Test Laboratory focuses mainly on analyzing printing and writing grades of paper.  Researchers are able to address most paper testing needs regarding strength, optical, and surface properties. Testing is conducted in a tightly controlled humidity room for optimum accuracy.

===Resources &amp; Technical Assistance===
*'''Center for Wood Anatomy Research''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/research/centers/woodanatomy/index.php|title=Forest Products Laboratory - USDA Forest Service|website=www.fpl.fs.fed.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center for Wood Anatomy Research at FPL is home to the world's largest research wood collection. Over 100,000 samples are used for research and identification purposes. Researchers study anatomical and other characteristics of wood that may affect their utilization potential, provide wood identification services, and answer questions concerning the properties, characteristics, and uses of tropical and obscure native species.
*'''Center for Forest Mycology Research''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/research/centers/mycology/culture-collection.shtml|title=Forest Products Laboratory - USDA Forest Service|website=www.fpl.fs.fed.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center for [[Mycology]] Research maintains a [[herbarium]] containing 70,000 dried specimens of decay [[fungi]] collected since the early 1900s, as well as a collection of more than 12,000 living cultures. Samples from these collections are used by researchers around the world to further their studies.  While located at FPL, the Center for Forest Mycology Research is officially a unit of the Forest Service's Northern Research Station.
*'''Technology Marketing Unit''':&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/research/units/tmu/index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Located at FPL, the USDA Forest Service State and Private Forestry's Technology Marketing Unit (TMU) provides a broad scope of expertise in wood products utilization and marketing, [[technology transfer]], and technical assistance.  The TMU works in collaboration with many different partners to ensure ready adoption of forest-based material technologies to many small, rural [[forest products]] businesses.  The breadth of their work includes forest products conservation, processing, manufacturing efficiency, marketing, recycling, and [[bioenergy]].  The technical assistance they provide includes publications, technical assistance visits, conferences, workshops, meetings, and one-on-one consultations over the phone or in person.  The TMU also manages and awards annual grants dedicated to helping improve the utilization of woody [[biomass]] removed from forest restoration projects.
*'''FPL Library''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/products/library/index.php|title=Forest Products Laboratory - USDA Forest Service|website=www.fpl.fs.fed.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; FPL houses a national Forest Service library that is open to the public. Subject areas include solid wood products, pulp and paper, mycology, wood anatomy, wood engineering, biotechnology, adhesives, wood preservation, fire research, economics, biodeterioration of wood, paints and coatings, and recycling.

==Research &amp; Testing Facilities==

===Centennial Research Facility===

[[Image:CRF rendering02.tif|thumb|right|The USDA Forest Products Laboratory's Centennial Research Facility in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].]]The most advanced large-scale addition to the FPL in over 70 years is the new Centennial Research Facility (CRF), a {{convert|87000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} multi-use laboratory. This facility was built to meet qualifications for Silver certification by the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) rating system developed by the [[U.S. Green Building Council]]. As such, the CRF was designed and built using strategies to improve performance across the most important efficiency metrics: energy savings, water usage, [[greenhouse gas]] emissions reduction, improved indoor environmental quality, and stewardship of resources including sensitivity to their impacts. CRF researchers in engineering mechanics can test the strength of full-scale structures while durability researchers put wood products to the test in a rather punishing weather simulation chamber. Modern preservation testing equipment will replace the older vessels previously used, while an efficient and manufacturing-friendly floor plan will help advance research in wood- and bio-based composites.&lt;ref&gt;Forest Products Journal, October, 2009, A Century of Research Working for You. Vol. 59(10) pp. 6-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research Demonstration House and Carriage House===

FPL has constructed two full-scale structures, the Research Demonstration House and Carriage House, for research and educational activities.  Both of these structures allow researchers to conduct housing-related studies in a real-world setting, which can significantly extend knowledge obtained in a laboratory environment. These structures are a result of collaboration through the Advanced Housing Research Center,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/research/centers/ahrc/index.shtml|title=Forest Products Laboratory - USDA Forest Service|website=www.fpl.fs.fed.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; established by FPL in 2000, which includes a wide range of partners from both the public and privates sectors working to improve housing technologies.

===Fire Test Lab===

The fire testing facility at FPL is key to developing safe, durable building products.  The current facility is equipped to perform standardized tests for flame retardancy and fire resistance.  Plans for construction of a new fire test facility are underway, and current capabilities will be enhanced by enabling simulation of actual fire scenarios on a larger scale. The new facility will allow researchers to better address wildland fire threats to structures and development of performance-based building codes.

===Pulp &amp; Paper Plant===

FPL's fiber processing pilot plant is equipped to replicate industrial pulping and papermaking processes on a pilot scale.  With capabilities in chip production, pulping, paper and fiberboard production, and even recycling, researchers can test new methods and evaluate their effectiveness on equipment similar to that used by commercial manufacturers.

===Nanocellulose Pilot Plant===

In August, 2012, the FPL unveiled a $1.7 million production facility for renewable, forest-based nanomaterials. This facility is the first of its kind in the United States and one that positions the laboratory as the country's leading producer of nanocellulose materials. Nanocellulose is simply wood fiber broken down to the nanoscale. For perspective, a nanometer is roughly one-millionth the thickness of an American dime. Materials at this minute scale have unique properties; nanocellulose-based materials can be stronger than Kevlar fiber and provide high strength properties with low weight. Applications for nanocellulose materials, for example, include use in lightweight armor and ballistic glass. Companies in the automotive, aerospace, electronics, consumer products, and medical device industries also see high potential for these innovative materials in a wide variety of applications.

The facility will support an emerging market for wood-derived renewable nanomaterials, helping to spur forest-based job growth and contribute an estimated $600 billion to the American economy by 2020.
The U.S. and other nations will see numerous benefits from the commercialization of wood-derived cellulosic nanomaterials.  Development and commercialization of new lightweight, high-performance wood-derived products can help reduce fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions while increasing the potential for rural manufacturing opportunities, including the creation of many new high-paying jobs. The Forest Product Lab's new facility will aid in the commercialization of these materials by providing researchers and early adopters of the technology with working quantities of forest-based nanomaterials.

In [[broadcast engineering]], a '''frequency extender''' is an [[Electronics|electronic]] [[Information appliance|device]] that allows [[high-fidelity]] [[analog (signal)|analog]]ue [[sound reproduction|audio]] to be sent over regular [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] [[telephone line]]s, without the loss of higher [[audio frequencies]] ([[Treble (sound)|treble]]).  It is an extended [[concept]] of a [[telephone hybrid]].

The [[concept]] uses frequency shifting to overcome the [[narrowband|narrow]] [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of regular telephone systems.  The input [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] is sent on one telephone line as-is, or in some cases upshifted to provide extra low-frequency response, and sent on a second line shifted down by 3 [[kHz]], which is normally the upper [[bandpass]] limit in telephony.  Thus, an audio frequency of 5&amp;nbsp;kHz is sent at 2&amp;nbsp;kHz.  A receiver on the other end then shifts the second line back up and [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixes]] it with the first.  This results in greatly improved audio, adding a full [[octave]] of range, and pushing the total bandpass to 6&amp;nbsp;kHz.  The sound is then acceptable for [[Human voice|voice]], if not for [[music]].

It is also possible to add other lines, each increasing the bandpass by another 3&amp;nbsp;kHz.  However, the [[Diminishing returns|law of diminishing returns]] takes over, because each successive octave is double the size of the last.  A third line  pushes the bandpass up 50[[%]] to 9&amp;nbsp;kHz, equivalent to [[AM radio]].  A fourth line would push it up 33% to 12&amp;nbsp;kHz.  [[FM radio]] quality would require five telephone lines to be installed, pushing the bandpass up 25% to 15&amp;nbsp;kHz.  The audio is shifted down by 6,9, and 12&amp;nbsp;kHz respectively for each additional line.

Frequency extenders have been nearly eliminated by [[POTS codec]]s.

In [[archaeology]], '''geophysical survey''' is ground-based physical sensing techniques used for archaeological imaging or mapping. [[Remote sensing]] and marine surveys are also used in archaeology, but are generally considered separate disciplines. Other terms, such as "geophysical prospection" and "archaeological geophysics" are generally synonymous.

== Overview ==

Geophysical survey is used to create maps of subsurface [[Feature (archaeology)|archaeological features]]. Features are the non-portable part of the [[archaeological record]], whether standing structures or traces of human activities left in the [[soil]]. Geophysical instruments can detect buried features when their physical properties contrast measurably with their surroundings. In some cases individual [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], especially metal, may be detected as well. Readings taken in a systematic pattern become a [[data set]] that can be rendered as image maps. Survey results can be used to guide [[Archaeological excavation|excavation]] and to give archaeologists insight into the patterning of non-excavated parts of the site. Unlike other [[Archaeology#Field methods|archaeological methods]], geophysical survey is neither invasive nor destructive. For this reason, it is often used where preservation (rather than excavation) is the goal, and to avoid disturbance of culturally sensitive sites such as cemeteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Society for Historical Archaeology technical briefs: Geophysical Mapping of Historic Cemeteries | url=http://sha.org/assets/documents/Technical_briefs_articles/vol3article_04.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although geophysical survey has been used in the past with intermittent success, good results are very likely when it is applied appropriately. It is most useful when it is used in a well-integrated research design where interpretations can be tested and refined. Interpretation requires a knowledge both of the archaeological record, and of the way it is expressed geophysically. Appropriate instrumentation, survey design, and data processing are essential for success, and must be adapted to the unique [[geology]] and archaeological record of each site. In the field, control of data quality and spatial accuracy are critical.

== Methods ==
[[Image:EMsurvey.jpg|thumb|right|250px|EM conductivity survey]]
Geophysical methods used in archaeology are largely adapted from those used in mineral exploration, [[engineering]], and [[geology]]. Archaeological mapping presents unique challenges, however, which have spurred a separate development of methods and equipment. In general, geological applications are concerned with detecting relatively large structures, often as deeply as possible. In contrast, most archaeological sites are relatively near the surface, often within the top meter of earth. Instruments are often configured to limit the depth of response to better resolve the near-surface phenomena that are likely to be of interest. Another challenge is to detect subtle and often very small features – which may be as ephemeral as organic staining from decayed wooden posts - and distinguish them from rocks, roots, and other natural “clutter.” To accomplish this requires not only sensitivity, but also high density of data points, usually at least one and sometimes dozens of readings per square meter.

Most commonly applied to archaeology are [[magnetometer]]s, [[electrical resistance]] meters, [[ground-penetrating radar]] (GPR) and electromagnetic (EM) [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]] meters. These methods can resolve many types of archaeological features, are capable of high sample density surveys of very large areas, and of operating under a wide range of conditions. While common [[metal detector]]s are geophysical sensors, they are not capable of generating high-resolution imagery. Other established and emerging technologies are also finding use in archaeological applications.

'''Electrical resistance meters''' can be thought of as similar to the [[Ohmmeter]]s used to test electrical circuits. In most systems, metal probes are inserted into the ground to obtain a reading of the local electrical resistance.  A variety of probe configurations are used, most having four probes, often mounted on a rigid frame. Capacitively coupled systems that do not require direct physical contact with the soil have also been developed. Archaeological features can be mapped when they are of higher or lower resistivity than their surroundings. A stone foundation might impede the flow of electricity, while the organic deposits within a midden might conduct electricity more easily than surrounding soils. Although generally used in archaeology for planview mapping, resistance methods also have a limited ability to discriminate depth and create vertical profiles (see [[Electrical resistivity tomography]]).

'''Electromagnetic (EM) conductivity''' instruments have a response that is comparable to that of resistance meters (conductivity is the inverse of resistance). Underground archaeological features are detected by creating a [[magnetic field]] underground by applying an electric current that has a known frequency and magnitude through a sending coil. The currents spur a secondary current in underground conductors that is picked up by a receiving coil. Changes in the underground conductivity can indicate buried features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dalan |first=Rinita |title=Defining archaeological features with electromagnetic surveys at the Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site |url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/defining-archaeological-features-electromagnetic-surveys-cahokia-mounds-state-historic-site-12 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128185423/http://www.mendeley.com/research/defining-archaeological-features-electromagnetic-surveys-cahokia-mounds-state-historic-site-12 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 January 2013 |accessdate=13 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electromagnetic Surveys|url=http://www.subsurfacesurveys.com/em.htm|accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although EM conductivity instruments are generally less sensitive than resistance meters to the same phenomena, they do have a number of unique properties. One advantage is that they do not require direct contact with the ground, and can be used in conditions unfavorable to resistance meters. Another advantage is relatively greater speed than resistance instruments. Unlike resistance instruments, conductivity meters respond strongly to metal. This can be a disadvantage when the metal is extraneous to the archaeological record, but can be useful when the metal is of archaeological interest. Some EM conductivity instruments are also capable of measuring [[magnetic susceptibility]], a property that is becoming increasingly important in archaeological studies.

[[Image:3030-mag.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Magnetic gradiometer map of Prehistoric fire-hearths]]
'''Magnetometers''' used in geophysical survey may use a single sensor to measure the total magnetic field strength, or may use two (sometimes more) spatially separated sensors to measure the gradient of the magnetic field (the difference between the sensors). In most archaeological applications the latter ([[gradiometer]]) configuration is preferred because it provides better resolution of small, near-surface phenomena. Magnetometers may also use a variety of different sensor types. Proton precession magnetometers have largely been superseded by faster and more sensitive fluxgate and caesium instruments.

Every kind of material has unique magnetic properties, even those that we do not think of as being “magnetic.” Different materials below the ground can cause local disturbances in the Earth’s magnetic field that are detectable with sensitive magnetometers. Magnetometers react very strongly to iron and steel, brick, burned soil, and many types of rock, and archaeological features composed of these materials are very detectable. Where these highly magnetic materials do not occur, it is often possible to detect very subtle anomalies caused by disturbed soils or decayed organic materials. The chief limitation of magnetometer survey is that subtle features of interest may be obscured by highly magnetic geologic or modern materials.

[[Image:radarsurvey.jpg|thumb|right|250px|GPR survey]]
'''[[Ground-penetrating radar]] (GPR)''' is perhaps the best known of these methods (although it is not the most widely applied in archaeology). The concept of radar is familiar to most people. In this instance, the radar signal – an electromagnetic pulse – is directed into the ground. Subsurface objects and stratigraphy (layering) will cause reflections that are picked up by a receiver. The travel time of the reflected signal indicates the depth. Data may be plotted as profiles, or as planview maps isolating specific depths.

GPR can be a powerful tool in favorable conditions (uniform sandy soils are ideal). It is unique both in its ability to detect some spatially small objects at relatively great depths and in its ability to distinguish the depth of anomaly sources. The principal disadvantage of GPR is that it is severely limited by less-than-ideal conditions. The high electrical conductivity of fine-grained sediments (clays and silts) causes conductive losses of signal strength; rocky or heterogeneous sediments scatter the GPR signal. Another disadvantage is that data collection is relatively slow.

'''Metal detectors''' use electromagnetic induction to detect metal. Although other types of instruments (notably magnetometers and electromagnetic conductivity meters) have some sensitivity to metal, specialized metal detectors are much more effective. Metal detectors are available in different configurations, varying in sophistication and sensitivity. Most have some capacity to discriminate between different types of metallic targets.

Common hand-held metal detectors are widely used by archaeologists. Most of these instruments do not create a logged data set and thus cannot be used for directly creating maps, but used in a systematic manner they can be a useful tool in archaeological research.  Sometimes external data loggers are attached to such detectors which collect information about detected materials and corresponding gps coordinates for further processing.  Misuse of these instruments on archaeological sites by treasure hunters and artifact collectors has been a serious problem in archaeological preservation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/feb/16/looting-antiquities-uk-heritage | work=The Guardian | first1=Maev | last1=Kennedy | first2=Sam | last2=Jones | title=Treasure raiders scooping up UK heritage | date=16 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicora.org/pdfs/RC31%20-%20looting.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/feb/16/looting-antiquities-uk-heritage | work=The Guardian | first1=Maev | last1=Kennedy | first2=Sam | last2=Jones | title=Treasure raiders scooping up UK heritage | date=16 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; however cooperative efforts between skilled amateur operators and academic teams are emerging in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sha.org/blog/index.php/2013/04/open-minds-clearer-signals-metal-detectorist-and-archaeologist-cooperation-takes-another-step | work=Society for Historical Archaeology | first1=Matthew | last1=Reeves | first2=Scott | last2=Clark | title=Open Minds, Clearer Signals – Metal Detectorist and Archaeologist Cooperation Takes Another Step | date=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not as commonly used in archaeology, sophisticated metal detectors are available having much greater sensitivity than hand-held models. These instruments are capable of data logging and sophisticated target discrimination. They can be mounted on wheeled carts for survey data collection.

'''[[Lidar]]''' ('''LIght raDAR''') is an optical remote sensing technology that can measure the distance to a target by illuminating the target with [[light]], often using pulses from a [[laser]]. Lidar has many applications in the field of archaeology including aiding in the planning of field campaigns, mapping features beneath forest canopy,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unb.ca/passc/ImpactDatabase/images/whitecourt.htm EID; crater beneath canopy]&lt;/ref&gt; and providing an overview of broad, continuous features that may be indistinguishable on the ground.  Lidar can also provide archaeologists with the ability to create high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) of archaeological sites that can reveal micro-topography that are otherwise hidden by vegetation. Lidar-derived products can be easily integrated into a Geographic Information System (GIS) for analysis and interpretation.

'''Data collection''' is broadly similar regardless of the particular sensing instrument. Survey usually involves walking with the instrument along closely spaced parallel traverses, taking readings at regular intervals. In most cases, the area to be surveyed is staked into a series of square or rectangular survey "grids" (terminology can vary). With the corners of the grids as known reference points, the instrument operator uses tapes or marked ropes as a guide when collecting data. In this way, positioning error can be kept to within a few centimeters for high-resolution mapping. Survey systems with integrated global positioning systems (GPS) have been developed, but under field conditions, currently available systems lack sufficient precision for high-resolution archaeological mapping. Geophysical instruments (notably metal detectors) may also used for less formally "scanning" areas of interest.

'''Data processing and imaging''' convert raw numeric data into interpretable maps. Data processing usually involves the removal of statistical outliers and noise, and interpolation of data points. Statistical filters may be designed to enhance features of interest (based on size, strength, orientation, or other criteria), or suppress obscuring modern or natural phenomena. [[inverse problem|Inverse modeling]] of archaeological features from observed data is becoming increasingly important. Processed data are typically rendered as images, as contour maps, or in false relief. When geophysical data are rendered graphically, the interpreter can more intuitively recognize cultural and natural patterns and visualize the physical phenomena causing the detected anomalies.

The use of geophysical survey is well established in European archaeology, especially in Great Britain, where it was pioneered in the 1940s and 1950s. It is increasingly employed in other parts of the world, and with increasing success as techniques are adapted to unique regional conditions.

In early surveys, measurements were recorded individually and plotted by hand. Although useful results were sometimes obtained, practical applications were limited by the enormous amount of labor required. Data processing was minimal and sample densities were necessarily low.

Although the sensitivity of sensors has improved, and new methods have been developed, the most important developments have been automated data logging and computers to handle and process large amounts of data. Continuing improvements in survey equipment performance and automation have made it possible to rapidly survey large areas. Rapid data collection has also made it practical to achieve the high sample densities necessary to resolve small or subtle features. Advances in processing and imaging software have made it possible to detect, display, and interpret subtle archaeological patterning within the geophysical data.

'''Glendon College''' ({{lang-fr|Collège universitaire Glendon}}) is a federated campus of [[York University]] in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada. An internationally oriented, [[bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]] [[liberal arts college]] with 84 full-time faculty members and a student population of about 2,700, Glendon is located in midtown Toronto's [[Lawrence Park, Toronto|Lawrence Park]] neighbourhood.
The college was founded as the first permanent establishment of [[York University]] when it began academic operation under the mentorship of the [[University of Toronto]] in September 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedland|first1=Martin|title=The University of Toronto: A History|date=2013|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=9781442615366|pages=410, 438, 443|edition=illustrated, reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the ''York University Act 1959'' legislation, York was once an affiliated institution of the University of Toronto, where the first cohort of faculty and students originally utilized the Falconer Hall building&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.utoronto.ca/about/law-school-buildings|title=Law School Buildings - University of Toronto Faculty of Law|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now part of the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/histpsyc/YorkPhaseOne.htm|title=YorkPhaseOne|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a temporary home before relocating north of the [[University of Toronto|St. George]] campus to Glendon Hall &amp;mdash; an estate that was willed by [[E.R. Wood]] for post-secondary purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/histpsyc/GlendonHall.htm|title=Glendon Hall|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, a landlot grant was offered by the Province of Ontario to build a new [[York University|campus]], which eventually ceased the bilateral partnership between the two institutions. York University became an independent institution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/histpsyc/phasethreeKeele.htm|title=phase three Keele|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Glendon refused to transfer to [[Keele Campus (York University)|Keele]], as the University of Toronto had no interest in reacquiring or maintaining the donated Wood property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pietropaolo|first1=Vicenzo|last2=Horn|first2=Michiel|title=York University: The Way Must Be Tried|publisher=McGill-Queen's - MQUP, 2009. Print.|location=Montreal|isbn=9780773577244|edition=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Murray G. Ross]] and diplomat [[Escott Reid]], who mutually proposed a novel plan for the college to educate students for fields in [[civil service]], [[governance]] and [[academia]], were appointed president and principal in 1959 and 1965, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=APhWY8BRgWkC|title=York University: The Way Must Be Tried|first=Michiel|last=Horn|date=11 December 2008|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1966, the college was officially inaugurated by Prime Minister [[Lester B. Pearson]] with the objective for Glendon to become a fully bilingual institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glendon.yorku.ca/about/english/history.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030231857/http://www.glendon.yorku.ca/about/english/history.php |archivedate=2014-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.yorku.ca/yul-88244/york-university-glendon-college-opening|title=The Right Honourable, Lester B.

A 2012 report on the state of French-language education in Ontario identified Glendon College as having an important role to play in the proposed future creation of a fully independent French-language university in the province, but noted that the college would need greater independence from York University to facilitate its participation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csfontario.ca/en/articles/189 "Investigation Report – The State of French-Language Postsecondary Education in Central-Southwestern Ontario: No access, no future"]. Office of the French Language Services Commissioner, June 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bilingualism ==
Glendon's undergraduate curriculum emphasizes languages, international affairs and public policy. Due to this, Glendon was recently granted $20 million by the Government of Ontario in order to become the country's first "Centre of Excellence
for French language and Bilingual Postsecondary Education," in collaboration with [[Collège Boréal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/document/nr/08.02/nr0227.html Ontario Invests In New Centre For French-Language Education At York University], News Release 27 February 2008, Ontario Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hume|first1=Christopher|title=Glendon College and the 21st-century campus: Christopher Hume|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2012/09/28/glendon_college_and_the_21stcentury_campus_christopher_hume.html|accessdate=11 March 2013|publisher=Toronto Star|date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language skill assessments are given to new students to determine the level needed to take to fulfill Glendon's second-language requirement. Students who attain higher levels can either take advanced-level language instruction in their second language, or a discipline course taught solely in their second language.

In addition, a variety of non-credit classes and programmes are offered by the college to students, faculty and the general public including introductory courses in foreign languages ([[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Cantonese]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]); indigenous languages in [[Inuktitut language|Inuktitut]] and [[Ojibwe language|Ojibway]]; and professional development courses in English and French. Students also have the opportunity to take other language courses available through the Languages, Literature and Linguistics department at York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/laps/dlll/|title=Department of Languages, Literatures &amp; Linguistics - Faculty of Liberal Arts &amp; Professional Studies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This bilingual approach to university education is said to be unique in Canada, because all students within Glendon College receive education in both [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]. Canada's other bilingual post-secondary institutions, including portions of [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]], [[Laurentian University]], [[University of Alberta]] ([[University of Alberta Faculté Saint-Jean|Faculté St-Jean]]), and the [[University of Ottawa]], often educate students in one language or the other. Although each one offers students the possibility of a fully bilingual education, Glendon is the only institution in Canada where all [[English language|anglophone]] and [[francophone]] students are required to take at least one compulsory class in their second language, regardless of their initial ability in the language. As a result, [[code-switching]] is relatively common among students on campus. At the end of their undergraduate studies, all students will demonstrate an intermediate level (minimum) of proficiency in their second language.

Glendon College was recently designated an institution offering French services under the [[French Language Services Act]], at the request of the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.ontario.ca/tcu/en/2016/03/ontario-strengthens-french-language-services-at-york-university.html|title=Ontario Strengthens French-Language Services at York University|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, there is a discussion around the establishment of an all-French university in Ontario, one that would be larger than the [[Université de Hearst]] and could conceivably be a multi-campus university serving several regions in the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/french-university-ontario-1.3452119|title=Students push for French University, and Queen's Park is going to hear about it|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesudburystar.com/2016/02/19/sudbury-support-for-french-university|title=Sudbury support for French university|first=|last=nurun.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some data suggest that Franco-Ontarian participation rates in university are comparable to that of English speakers, obviating the need for a French-language university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/education/uniandcollege/ontario-doesnt-need-another-french-university/|title=Ontario doesn't need another French university - Macleans.ca|date=29 November 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heqco.ca/en-ca/Research/ResPub/Pages/Issue-Paper-No-17-Informing-policy-through-analysis-of-current-research.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== Degrees ==
Glendon is a primarily undergraduate institution where academics are rooted in York's liberal arts and professional studies program, although the college mainly specializes in the [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]]. Glendon offers 21 undergraduate degree (BA) and 18 [[International education|international]] Bachelor of Arts concentrations. Glendon has a unique concurrent and consecutive Bachelor of Education (B.Ed) focused specifically on preparing teachers for French immersion, extended French and core French teaching positions in anglophone schools. Glendon has recently initiated its first BSc/iBSc degrees, in psychology and biology and its first ever business administration and international studies dual degree (BBA/iBA) in partnership with the [[EMLYON Business School]], along with a new BA/iBA degree in communications.

There are also concurrent/consecutive certificate programs in a variety of fields (teaching English as an international language (D-TEIL), law and social thought, rédaction professionnelle (offered in French only), refugee and migration studies, sexuality studies, Spanish/English – English-Spanish translation, and technical and professional communication).

Since its inception in the early 1960s, the college has grown to also include a graduate school offering master's programs in French studies (M.A.), public and international affairs (M.P.I.A.), translation studies (M.A.) and conference interpretation (M.C.I.). The translation and interpreting masters build on the college's strength in languages while the public and international affairs degree is affiliated with the Glendon School of Public and International Affairs. There is also a doctoral degree in francophone studies (Ph.D.).

Any student attending Glendon can enroll in up to 50 per cent of his or her classes at the larger Keele campus, and vice versa. This policy is meant to give students the resources of a larger university while maintaining the qualities and features of a small college.

== Student life ==
Mirroring the campus life of small-scale American institutions like [[Swarthmore College|Swarthmore]] and [[Williams College|Williams]], Glendon has a tight-knit community within the larger student population of their sister campus. Various campus events are organized by the Glendon College Student Union/l'Association Étudiante du Collège Glendon (GCSU/AÉCG) and its membership includes all students enrolled in courses at Glendon College and elects a council to represent them. Students can join and access a number of clubs and organizations on both of the campuses. Glendon has a newspaper (''Pro Tem''), York University's premier and longest student-run campus publication that is published in both English and French; a [[campus radio]] station ([[Radio Glendon]]); the Grand Rassemblement de l’Éducation en Français (GREF): Glendon's French language publishing house; and a [[black box theatre]] company, Theatre Glendon/Théâtre Glendon, in addition to similar media from [[York University]], of which Glendon is formally a part.

Other facilities exist for students, such as a student lounge, a cafeteria, campus gym memberships, workshops, IT services, and a liaison office for prospective students. The college also encourages students to utilize the academic resources on both campuses. The college's proximity to [[Yonge and Eglinton]] and [[Downtown Toronto]] makes its location ideal for students who want to partake in the city's diverse array of social and cultural attractions. Glendon College is also where the first issue of the ''[[Toronto Special]]'' newspaper was published, according to the ''[[National Post]]''. The Salon Francophone, situated in the main building, is a social resource centre and a club, which organizes multiple activities to promote the French language.

Glendon was initially planned on being a [[residential college]] where students were required to live on campus, however, over the past couple of decades the increase in students outnumbered the available residential spaces. Therefore, the majority of students commute, while only around 400 students live on campus. Glendon's international profile attracts students from over 100 countries, in particular, a significant number of [[francophone]] students from across Canada (notably [[Quebec]]) and around the world, including [[France]], [[Haiti]], [[Belgium]], [[Morocco]], and [[Algeria]]. Approximately 1/3 of the student population are francophone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glendon.yorku.ca/futurestudents/academic-programs/the-bilingual-requirement/sociallybilingual/|title=Learning French Beyond the Classroom - Future Students|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Glendon has a visible [[hispanophone]] presence with more than 20% studying [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as a third language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glendon.yorku.ca/hispanicstudies/more.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130192645/http://www.glendon.yorku.ca/hispanicstudies/more.php |archivedate=2015-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish Resource Centre library at Glendon is a joint initiative between the [[Ministry of Education (Spain)|Ministry of Education]] of the [[Government of Spain]] and the Hispanic studies department of [[York University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myglendon.yorku.ca/monglendon.nsf/a7e65f88702320d28525734f00011f74/3412bbdf594ae7f785257515004983ed?OpenDocument|title=GLENDON - Spanish Resource Centre Reopens at Glendon|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campus ==
Glendon occupies the former country estate of [[Edward Rogers Wood]], a prominent Toronto financier and philanthropist of the early 1900s. The estate was built in 1924 and is located at the intersection of Bayview and Lawrence Ave. between the neighbourhoods of [[Lawrence Park, Toronto|Lawrence Park]] and [[Bridle Path, Toronto|Bridle Path]]. The estate was the original York University campus when it was bequeathed by the [[University of Toronto]], and it remained a [[liberal arts college]] when York's [[Keele Campus (York University)|Keele campus]] was inaugurated in 1966. The college is formally one of York's 9 colleges and 11 faculties, and is considered semi-autonomous within York University. Glendon's founder and first principal was Canadian diplomat [[Escott Reid]] who foresaw the institution's key mandate to educate future leaders of Canada in both official languages. Historically, the manor served as a temporary home for the [[OCAD University|Ontario College of Art]] in 1952,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ocadu.ca/Assets/PDF_MEDIA/Dorothy+H.+Hoover+Library/HistoryOCADLibrary.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Faculty of Law of the [[University of Toronto]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horn|first1=Michiel|title=York University: The Way Must Be Tried|publisher=McGill-Queen's - MQUP, Print.|location=Montreal|isbn=9780773577244|page=28|edition=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the natural landscape of the 85-acre estate was used as an [[arboretum]] by the [[botany]] and [[forestry]] department at the University of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horn|first1=Michiel|title=York University: The Way Must Be Tried|publisher=McGill-Queen's - MQUP, Print.|location=Montreal|isbn=9780773577244|pages=27, 29|edition=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently, the college is the institutional home of the Glendon School of Public &amp; International Affairs, the first bilingual graduate school in Canada to offer a MPIA, in collaboration with ''The Global Brief'', Canada's top [[international affairs]] publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.yorku.ca/2009/09/15/global-brief-finds-new-home-at-york-u%E2%80%99s-glendon-college/|title=Global Brief finds new home at York U’s Glendon College - York Media Relations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graduate school also operates an interdisciplinary research institute for public policy &amp;mdash; the [[Centre for Global Challenges]].  The Faculty of Graduate Studies also manages a [[doctoral|PhD]] program and three other distinct [[Master's degree|MA]] programs. The Centre of Excellence for French language and Bilingual Post-secondary Education is Glendon's recent expansion and was created to accommodate the growth of incoming students and the increasing demand for multilingual post-secondary education in Southern Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glendon.yorku.ca/centreofexcellence/english/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924083935/http://www.glendon.yorku.ca/centreofexcellence/english/ |archivedate=2014-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The campus has also played host to several productions, namely ''[[American Psycho 2: All American Girl]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Time Traveler's Wife (film)|The Time Traveler's Wife]]''(2009), which were extensively filmed in and around Glendon. Hedley also filmed their Lost in Translation music video at Glendon. Often, students are incorporated into shooting when the campus is sealed off for the weekends.

=== Buildings and abbreviations ===
*'''York Hall (YH) / Pavillon York;''' the main building, shaped like an 'h', divided into four sections (the main wing, and the "A", "B", and "C" wings).

*'''Wood Residence (WR) / Résidence Wood;''' a 189-room residence building. It houses students in typical dormitory-style rooms. Wood is the smaller of the two residences&amp;mdash;there are only 22–30 students per house (section of the building). Students are divided into five houses A through E; each house spans three floors with a single shared common room on the ground floor. Changes in Residence Life programming have led to the creation of a "Quiet Floor" in the basement of B-house for students who wish to enjoy an extension of the regular late-night quiet hours when all residents must avoid inappropriately loud noises. As well, the entirety of C House will become "Green" for students who wish to enjoy a more environmentally friendly lifestyle within residence.
*'''Greenhouse (GR) / La Serre;''' The Greenhouse was the Woods' old greenhouse, primarily under the care of Agnes Euphemia Smart, the widow of Mr. Wood. It is now used for the Security, Parking and Transportation Services offices, Housing and Residence services offices, as well as the campus goSAFE student escort service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/gosafe/gosafe.html|title=goSAFE Services|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, students visit the Greenhouse to resolve security and campus fine issues, or for residence related issues such as keys/keycards, tax-exempt stickers for the cafeteria or any maintenance or service required in residence.

The '''Hussain Ebrahim Jamal Research Institute of Chemistry''', ICCBS, widely known as HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry, is an [[Applied science|advanced]] [[Research institute| research center]] in [[Karachi]], [[Sindh province|Sindh Province]] of [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry"&gt;{{Cite web   | last =HEJ-RIC    | first =HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry   | authorlink =   | coauthors =    | title =History of HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry | work =    | publisher =HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry   | url =http://www.iccs.edu/hej/index.php   | doi =    | accessdate=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, Prof. Salimuzzaman Siddiqui established a postgraduate institute of chemistry in the department of Chemistry, University of Karachi. Dr. Atta ur Rahman joined the Institute later on after obtaining Ph.D. from the Kings College, Cambridge University, later he accepted a 4-year assignment as a Fellow of Kings College, Cambridge University. Currently the institute is led by Prof. Dr. M. Iqbal Choudhary as the director of the ICCBS. The HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry (HEJRIC) oversees Pakistan’s largest doctoral program in a single field of interest. The main areas of student training and research include natural product, protein and synthetic organic chemistry, computational medicinal chemistry, pharmacology and plant biotechnology. Specific areas of research relate largely to pharmacological studies of novel natural products and protein chemistry. 

==Overview==
On the retirement of Professor [[Salimuzzaman Siddiqui]] (FRS) as Chairman PCSIR, his services were taken up by the University of Karachi and a "Postgraduate Institute of Chemistry" was established under his Directorship in 1967 in a wing of the Department of Chemistry. PCSIR provided the services of some of its staff (including Dr. Viqar Uddin Ahmad and Dr. Zafar H. Zaidi) and furniture during the initial phase of the establishment of this institute. Dr. Atta ur Rahman joined the Institute in March 1969 after obtaining Ph.D. from the Kings College, Cambridge University, later he accepted a 4-year assignment as a Fellow of Kings College, Cambridge University. He was then sent by Cambridge University to the University of Karachi during 1971-74 to assist in the setting up of a modern postgraduate institute of chemistry, and he brought with him donations of gas chromatograph, balances and a combustion microanalyser from Cambridge University.
Dr. Atta-ur-Rahman succeeded in obtaining grants to acquire a new mass and NMR spectrometers, both of which were installed in 1973, within a year of his return to Pakistan. He was appointed as the Co-Director in 1977. He succeeded in winning several major projects for the institute from the West, which have transformed the institute into the finest center in Asia and one of the best in the world in the field of Natural Product Chemistry. A generous donation was offered to the University for the Institute by the leading philanthropist/industrialist Mr. Latif Ebrahim Jamal on behalf of the Husein Ebrahim Jamal Foundation in 1976, the largest donation at that time in the history of the country. The Institute was accordingly named as "Husein Ebrahim Jamal Research Institute of Chemistry", in the memory of late Mr. Husein Ebrahim Jamal.
The efforts of Professor Dr. W. Voelter of Tuebingen University, Germany, deserve a special praise since the initial grant of 2.3 million DM from the Republic of Germany was largely due to his untiring efforts, and collaborative researches continue with his group till today.
Professor Atta-ur-Rahman was appointed as the Director in January 1990, while Professor Viqar Uddin Ahmad took over as Co-Director in 1990. In 2000, Professor Bina S. Siddiqui was appointed as the Co-Director on the retirement of Professor Ahmad, while in 2002 Professor Dr. M. Iqbal Choudhary was given the responsibilities of the Director (Acting) of ICCBS and Co-Director of Dr. Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research. In September 2008, he was appointed as the Director of the ICCBS institutions. During last ten years, the institute has gone through a rapid and unprecedented expansion, both in terms of infrastructure development and academic programs, while maintaining the highest quality in research and student training.
The institute has organized a number of major international conferences and symposia on various aspects of Natural Product Chemistry, Spectroscopy and Protein Chemistry. The institute had the distinction of hosting the 19th IUPAC Symposium on Natural Product Chemistry in January 1994 in which over 500 scientists from 52 countries, including 4 Nobel Laureates participated.
Additionally the Institute has also been selected as one of the three library centers of the Third World Academy of Sciences (TWAS). The H.E.J. Institute has been designated as the W.H.O. Center for Pesticide Analysis for the Eastern Mediterranean Region. The institute is also a member of the IUCN-International, WAITRO, and COMSATS. More recently the institute is designated as the OIC Center of Excellence in Chemical Sciences. In 2001, the H.E.J. Research Institute became a constituent institution of the International Center for Chemical Sciences (later named as International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences).
In 2004, the H.E.J. Research Institute received the most prestigious IDB (Islamic Development Bank) prize for the best science institution in the entire Islamic world. Recently, the IDB awarded the best science institution again to the H.E.J. Research Institute (second time), an unprecedented honor to any science institution in OIC region.
In August 2003, an Industrial Analytical Center was established as the service wing of H. E. J. Institute. Third World Center (TWC) Laboratory complex was formally inaugurated by the Prime Minister of Pakistan in 2005 as an extension of the H.E.J. Research Institute of Chemistry. The building of TWC was renamed as Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman Laboratories by the Executive Board in 2011, in recognition of the outstanding services of Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman (FRS) who is now serving the ICCBS institution as the Patron-in-chief.
Molecular medicine is an emerging new field, which deals with the understanding of the molecular basis of diseases and then developing appropriate strategies for their early diagnosis, management and elimination. Knowledge of human biology and disease mechanism at molecular level is the most important step in developing effective disease prevention and treatment. In the year 2004, the Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research (PCMD) was established through a generous donation and patronage of Ms. Nadira Panjwani (Chairperson, Dr. Panjwani Memorial Trust) in the memory of her beloved father, Dr. Mohammad Hussain Panjwani, a leading scholar and philanthropist. The main objective of the center is to train highly qualified manpower in the emerging new fields of molecular medicine and drug development. The academicians, clinicians and pharmaceutical researchers are brought together to translate basic scientific discoveries into new therapies, vaccines and diagnostic tests. 
Late Mr. Latif Ebrahim Jamal, Chairman Ebrahim Jamal Foundation, continuing his patronage to the Institute, established the Latif Ebrahim Jamal National Science Information Center in 2005. The beautiful building of this one of the largest paperless libraries of the region was constructed under the direct supervision of Mr. Aziz Latif Jamal S.I. (Current Chairman Husein Ebrahim Jamal Foundation), able and committed son of (Late) Mr. Latif Ebrahim Jamal.

== Work on Participation ==
Kapoor first came to prominence in the early 2000s through a series of influential journal articles on [[participatory development]] (the practice of involving beneficiaries of international development programs in decision-making).&lt;ref name = "kesby"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=a38326|title=Mike Kesby survey article on new participatory approaches in Geography|publisher=[[Environment and Planning]] |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GoogleScholar"/&gt;  Kapoor is critical of such a practice, arguing that while it looks noble and promising (when adopted by the [[World Bank]] or any other international agency), it is often an excuse to further [[neoliberal]] policies, and can even result in authoritarian and exclusionary practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01436590220108199|title=Kapoor's famous journal article, The Devil's in the Theory|journal=[[Third World Quarterly]] |accessdate=2012-11-06|doi=10.1080/01436590220108199|volume=23|issue=1|pages=101–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Kapoor's critique helped frame an issue of ''[[Current Issues in Comparative Education]]'' (published at [[Columbia University]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=Spring 2004|title=Participatory Development: A Promise Revisited|journal=[[Current Issues in Comparative Education]]|publisher=[[Teachers College, Columbia University]]|volume=6|issue=2|issn=1523-1615|url=http://devweb.tc.columbia.edu/centers/cice2012/index.asp?Id=Past+Issues&amp;Info=Volume+6%2C+Issue+2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kapoor's 2008 book, ''The Postcolonial Politics of Development'', is a collection of essays written between 2002-2007.&lt;ref name="pcd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415773980/ |title=The Postcolonial Politics of Development By Ilan Kapoor |publisher=Routledge|accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="googlebookspcd"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ro/books?id=IXGTAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ilan+kapoor&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq0sGV8PXYAhXR_aQKHfI4AIgQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=ilan%20kapoor&amp;f=false/ |title=The Postcolonial Politics of Development By Ilan Kapoor |publisher=Google|accessdate=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is one of the first to analyze development issues from a postcolonial perspective. It has received many positive reviews.&lt;ref name="pcd"/&gt; Kapoor examines recent international development policy areas (governance, human/gender rights, participation), carrying out a cultural and political economy critique of them. He argues that development practitioners and western(ized) elites are often complicit in perpetuating contemporary forms of imperialism. The book concludes by arguing for the need for a radical self-reflexivity on the part of development workers, institutions and academics; while at the same time emphasizing the political strategies of marginalized groups that can lead to greater democratic dialogue.&lt;ref name="pcd"/&gt;

Ilan Kapoor is the brother of artist [[Anish Kapoor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewidgetsonline.net/dxreader/Reader.aspx?token=SdM95J3G5C++HWNBNmqW5A%3d%3d&amp;rand=2036086087&amp;buyNowLink=&amp;page=&amp;chapter= |title=Acknowledgements in The Postcolonial Politics of Development| publisher=Routledge|accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter designed the book cover for Kapoor's 2008 book, ''The Postcolonial Politics of Development''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EnvDHjNaVIUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Acknowledgements in The Postcolonial Politics of Development| publisher=GoogleBooks/Routledge|accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, Kapoor resigned as editorial board member of the journal ''Third World Quarterly'' (along with roughly half of the journal's editorial board members) in protest against the journal publishing an article making a "case for colonialism."&lt;ref name = "TS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/09/21/how-an-article-defending-colonialism-was-ever-published-is-a-mystery-roiling-academia-paradkar.html|title=News article, "How an article defending colonialism was ever published is a mystery roiling academia"|publisher=[[Toronto Star]] |accessdate=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "CHE"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/A-Revolt-at-a-Journal-Puts/241289|title=News article, "A Revolt at a Journal Puts Peer Review Under the Microscope"|publisher=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |accessdate=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work on Celebrity Humanitarianism ==
Kapoor's most recent book is ''Celebrity Humanitarianism: The Ideology of Global Charity'' (2012).&lt;ref name="CH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415783392/|publisher=Routledge|title=Celebrity Humanitarianism |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="googlebooksCH"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ro/books?id=CTpd5oXI5LMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ilan+kapoor&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq0sGV8PXYAhXR_aQKHfI4AIgQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ilan%20kapoor&amp;f=false |title=Celebrity Humanitarianism By Ilan Kapoor |publisher=GoogleBooks|accessdate=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is one of the first to critically assess the relatively new phenomenon of global celebrity philanthropy (by the likes of [[Bono]], [[Geldof]], [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Bill Gates]], [[George Soros]]). The author carries out a stinging critique of celebrity charity work and corporate philanthropy.&lt;ref name = "nationalpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/the-spectacle-of-charity-a-york-professors-new-book-accuses-celebrities-of-humanitainment|title=News article, "A York professor’s new book accuses celebrities of ‘humanitainment’"|publisher=[[National Post]] |accessdate=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He shows how this charity is not just self-promoting, but also helps justify and worsen the global inequality brought about by capitalism. Kapoor also draws attention to what he sees as a new phenomenon of "spectacular NGOs," not-for-profit development organizations such as [[Save Darfur]] or [[Medecins Sans Frontieres]] ([[Doctors Without Borders]]) that don’t just get celebrity endorsements but seek out celebrity status themselves. He takes them to task for being more interested in branding, spectacle and short-term results than addressing broader and long-term problems of social inequality and political inclusion.&lt;ref name="CH"/&gt;

The [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] is [[United States federal law]] enacted in 1990 that governs how states and public agencies provide [[Early childhood intervention|early intervention]], [[Special education in the United States|special education]], and related services to children with [[Disability|disabilities]].  In the state of [[Hawaii]], along with similar state-level legislation, it has been implemented in an Early Intervention program for qualifying children.

==Early Intervention: for Children Under the Age 3==
Early Intervention is a federal and state-mandated program that provides services to support the development of infant and toddlers from birth to three years of age.  In Hawaii, Early Intervention is managed by the [[Hawaii Department of Health|Department of Health.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.gov/health/family-child-health/eis/index.html|title=Hawaii State Department of Health|website=www.hawaii.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==After Age Three==
Under current regulations, Early Intervention services cease when a child turns 3 years old.  Instead, Early Intervention children are required on their 3rd birthday to attend a Special Education Preschool that is run by the [[Hawai'i Department of Education|Hawaii Department of Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://doe.k12.hi.us/specialeducation/preschoolsped.htm|title=State of Hawaii - Special Education|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''I'''ndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) allows States to extend Early Intervention services to eligible children who are between 3 and 5 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access.gpo.gov/uscode/title20/chapter33_subchapteri_.html (IDEA)]&lt;/ref&gt; This option maximizes parental choice, as it allows each parent to decide which option best meets the educational needs of their disabled child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cf/20USCodeSec1435.pdf|title=20 US Code Section 1435|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State of Hawaii is considering legislation that would extend Early Intervention services to eligible children who are between 3 and 5 years of age. In 2007, those bills are House Bill 531 and Senate Bill 1176.

'''Infrastructure as code''' ('''IaC''') is the process of managing and provisioning computer [[data center]]s through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.&lt;ref name="AWS in Action, IaC" /&gt;
The [[IT infrastructure]] managed by this comprises both physical equipment such as [[bare-metal server]]s as well as [[virtual machine]]s and associated configuration resources.
The definitions may be in a [[version control system]].
It can use either scripts or declarative definitions, rather than manual processes, but the term is more often used to promote declarative approaches.

IaC approaches are promoted for [[cloud computing]], which is sometimes marketed as [[infrastructure as a service]] (IaaS). IaC supports IaaS, but should not be confused with it.&lt;ref name="AWS in Action, IaC" /&gt;

==Overview==
IaC grew as a response to the difficulty posed from two pieces of technology – utility computing and second-generation web frameworks. This brought about widespread scaling problems for many enterprises that were previously only witnessed by huge companies.&lt;ref name="CCA" &gt;{{cite report
  |last= Fletcher | first= Colin | last2= Cosgrove | first2=Terrence
  |title=Innovation Insight for Continuous Configuration Automation Tools
  |website=Gartner
  |url=http://www.gartner.com/document/3119319?ref=unauthreader
  |  date=26 August 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006 specifically the launch of [[Amazon Web Services]]’ [[Elastic Compute Cloud]] and the 1.0 version of [[Ruby on Rails]] just months before.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite journal
  | last=Bower |first=Joseph L.
  | last2= Christensen | first2= Claton M.
  | title= Disruptive Technologies: Catching the Wave
  | journal= [[Harvard Business Review]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; With new tools emerging to handle this ever growing field, the idea of IaC was born. The thought of modelling infrastructure with code, and then having the ability to design, implement, and deploy applications infrastructure with known software best practices appealed to software developers and IT infrastructure administrators. The ability to treat it like code and use the same tools as any other software project would allow developers to rapidly deploy applications.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite journal
  | last= Riley| first= Chris| date= 12 November 2015
  | title= Version Your Infrastructure
  | url= http://devops.com/2015/11/12/version-your-infrastructure/
  | journal=DevOps.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011 Amazon announced [[AWS CloudFormation]] &lt;ref&gt;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2011/02/25/introducing-aws-cloudformation/&lt;/ref&gt; which provides a [[Infrastructure as Code#Declarative|declarative]] template-based IaC model for configuring AWS.{{sfnp|AWS in Action|Wittig|2016|page=112}}

==Added value and advantages==
The value of IaC can be broken down into three, measurable categories: Cost (reduction), speed (faster execution) and risk (remove errors and security violations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | url=http://devops.com/2015/02/26/how-deploy-frequency-impacts-infrastructure-stability/
  | title=How Deploy Frequency Impacts Infrastructure Stability
  | last= Macvittie |first= Lori
  | website= DevOps.com
  | date= 26 February 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in citation given|date=March 2017}} Cost reduction aims at helping not only the enterprise financially, but also in terms of people and effort, meaning that by removing the manual component, people are able to refocus their efforts towards other enterprise tasks.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Infrastructure automation enables speed through faster execution when configuring your infrastructure and aims at providing visibility to help other teams across the enterprise work quickly and more efficiently. Automation removes the risk associated with human error, like manual misconfiguration; removing this can decrease downtime and increase reliability.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} These outcomes and attributes help the enterprise move towards implementing a culture of [[DevOps]], the combined working of [[Software development|development]] and [[Information technology operations|operations]].&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web

  | website= DevOps.com
  | date= 14 May 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of approaches ==
There are generally three approaches to IaC: [[declarative programming|declarative]] (functional) vs. [[imperative programming|imperative]] (procedural) vs. intelligent (environment aware).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The difference between the declarative, the imperative and the intelligent approach is essentially '' 'what' '' versus '' 'how' '' versus '' 'why' ''. {{anchor|Declarative}}The declarative approach focuses on what the eventual target configuration should be; the {{anchor|Imperative}}imperative focuses on how the infrastructure is to be changed to meet this; the intelligent approach focuses on why the configuration should be a certain way in consideration of all the co-relationships and co-dependencies of multiple applications running on the same infrastructure typically found in production.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web
  | url= https://www.scriptrock.com/blog/articles/declarative-vs.-imperative-models-for-configuration-management
  | title= Declarative v. Imperative Models for Configuration Management: Which Is Really Better?
  |website= Scriptrock.com
  | access-date= 14 December 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declarative approach defines the desired state and the system executes what needs to happen to achieve that desired state. Imperative defines specific commands that need to be executed in the appropriate order to end with the desired conclusion.  The intelligent determines the correct desired state before the system executes what needs to happen to achieve a desired state that does not impact co-dependent applications.  Environment aware desired state is the next generation of IaC.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite magazine

  | location= Lawrence, KS USA | publisher= Linux New Media USA LLC
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
There are two methods of IaC: '' '[[push technology|push]]' '' and '' '[[pull technology|pull]]' ''. The main difference is the manner in which the servers are told how to be configured. In the pull method the server to be configured will pull its configuration from the controlling server. In the push method the controlling server pushes the configuration to the destination system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2172097/virtualization/puppet-vs--chef-vs--ansible-vs--salt.html | title= Puppet vs. Chef vs. Ansible vs. Salt| last= Venezia | first=Paul | date= 21 November 2013| website= networkworld.com | publisher= Network World | access-date=14 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==
There are many tools that fulfill infrastructure automation capabilities and use IaC. Broadly speaking, any framework, or tool that performs changes or configures infrastructure declaratively or imperatively based on a programmatic approach can be considered IaC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Garner Market Trends: DevOps – Not a Market, but Tool-Centric Philosophy That supports a Continuous Delivery Value Chain |publisher=Gartner |date=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, server (lifecycle) automation and configuration management tools were used to accomplish IaC, now enterprises are using continuous configuration automation tools or stand-alone IaC frameworks, such as Microsoft’s PowerShell DSC.&lt;ref name = powershell&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Chaganti|first=Ravikanth |date= 5 January 2016 |title=DevOps, Infrastructure as Code, and PowerShell DSC: The Introduction |url=http://www.powershellmagazine.com/2016/01/05/devops-infrastructure-as-code-and-powershell-dsc-the-introduction/ |magazine= PowerShell Magazine  |publisher=PowerShell Magazine |access-date=11 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuous configuration automation===
All [[continuous configuration automation]] (CCA) tools can be thought of as an extension of traditional IaC frameworks; it leverages IaC to change, configure, and automate infrastructure, but it also provides visibility, efficiency and flexibility in how your infrastructure is managed.&lt;ref name= CCA /&gt; These additional attributes provide enterprise level security and compliance - making companies keen on implementing these types of tools.

====Community content====
An important aspect when considering CCA tools, if they are open source, is the community content. As [[Gartner]] states, the value of CCA tools is “as dependent on user community-contributed content and support as it is on the commercial maturity and performance of the automation tooling.”&lt;ref name=CCA/&gt; Vendors like [[Puppet (software)|Puppet]] and [[Chef (software)|Chef]], those that have been around a significant amount of time, have created their own communities; Chef has [[Chef Community Repository]] and Puppet has [[PuppetForge]],&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web
  |url=https://philsturgeon.uk/devops/2012/10/28/puppet-or-chef/
  |title=Puppet or Chef?
  | last= Sturgeon |first= Phil
  | date= 28 October 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; other vendors rely on adjacent communities and leverage other IaC frameworks such as [[PowerShell]] DSC.&lt;ref name=powershell/&gt; New vendors are emerging that are not content driven, but model driven with the intelligence in the product to deliver content. These visual, object-oriented systems work well for developers, but they are especially useful to production oriented DevOps and operations constituents that value models versus scripting for content. As the field continues to develop and change, the community based content will become ever important to how IaC tools are used, unless they are model driven and object oriented.

==Relationship to DevOps==
IaC can be a key attribute of enabling best practices in [[DevOps]] – Developers become more involved in defining configuration and Ops teams get involved earlier in the development process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://info.easydynamics.com/blog/continuous-integration-infrastructure-as-code |title= Continuous Integration: Infrastructure as Code in DevOps | last= Ramos | first= Martin | website= easydynamics.com | date= 4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tools that utilize IaC bring visibility to the state and configuration of servers and ultimately provide the visibility to users within the enterprise, aiming to bring teams together to maximize their efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Infrastructure As Code: Fueling the Fire for Faster Application Delivery |publisher=Forrester |date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Automation in general aims to take the confusion and error-prone aspect of manual processes and make it more efficient, and productive. Allowing for better software and applications to be created with flexibility, less downtime, and an overall cost effective way for the company. IaC is intended to reduce the complexity that kills efficiency out of manual configuration. Automation and collaboration are considered central points in DevOps; Infrastructure automation tools are often included as components of a [[DevOps toolchain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | last= Wurster | first= Laurie F. |last2= Colville | first2= Ronni J. |last3= Height| first3= Cameron | last4= Tripathi | first4= Somendra | last5= Rastogi | first5= Aditi | title= Emerging Technology Analysis: DevOps a Culture Shift, Not a Technology| publisher= Gartner }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Landscape architecture''' is the design of outdoor areas, landmarks, and structures to achieve environmental, social-behavioural, or aesthetic outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe, Susan Jellicoe, The Landscape of Man: Shaping the Environment from Prehistory to the Present Day {{ISBN|9780500274316}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the systematic investigation of existing social, ecological, and soil conditions and processes in the landscape, and the design of interventions that will produce the desired outcome.  The scope of the profession includes [[landscape design]]; [[site planning]]; [[Stormwater#Stormwater management|stormwater management]]; erosion control; [[natural environment|environmental]] [[ecological restoration|restoration]]; [[park]]s and recreation planning; visual resource management; green infrastructure planning and provision; and private [[estate (land)|estate]] and [[house|residence]] landscape master planning and design; all at varying scales of design, planning and management. A practitioner in the profession of landscape architecture is called a [[landscape architect]].

==Definition==
Landscape architecture is a multi-disciplinary field, incorporating aspects of [[botany]], [[horticulture]], the [[fine art]]s, [[architecture]], [[industrial design]], [[soil sciences]], [[environmental psychology]], [[geography]], [[ecology]], and [[civil engineering]]. The activities of a landscape architect can range from the creation of public parks and parkways to site planning for campuses and corporate office parks, from the design of residential estates to the design of civil [[infrastructure]] and the management of large [[wilderness]] areas or [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] of degraded landscapes such as mines or [[landfill]]s. Landscape architects work on structures and external spaces with limitations toward the landscape or park aspect of the design - large or small, [[urban area|urban]], [[suburban]] and [[rural]], and with "hard" (built) and "soft" (planted) materials, while integrating ecological [[Sustainable development|sustainability]].  The most valuable contribution can be made at the first stage of a project to generate ideas with technical understanding and creative flair for the design, organization, and use of spaces. The landscape architect can conceive the overall concept and prepare the master plan, from which detailed design drawings and technical specifications are prepared. They can also review proposals to authorize and supervise contracts for the construction work. Other skills include preparing design impact assessments, conducting environmental assessments and audits, and serving as an expert witness at inquiries on land use issues.

Landscape managers use their knowledge of landscape processes to advise on the long-term care and development of the landscape. They often work in [[forestry]], nature [[conservation ethic|conservation]] and [[agriculture]].

Landscape scientists have specialist skills such as [[soil science]], [[hydrology]], [[geomorphology]] or [[botany]] that they relate to the practical problems of landscape work. Their projects can range from site surveys to the ecological assessment of broad areas for planning or management purposes. They may also report on the impact of development or the importance of particular [[species]] in a given area.

Landscape planners are concerned with [[landscape planning]] for the location, scenic, ecological and recreational aspects of urban, rural and coastal land use.
Their work is embodied in written statements of policy and strategy, and their remit includes master planning for new developments, landscape evaluations and assessments, and preparing countryside management or policy plans. Some may also apply an additional specialism such as [[landscape archaeology]] or law to the process of landscape planning.

[[Green roof]] (or more specifically, vegetative roof) designers design extensive and intensive [[roof garden]]s for [[storm water]] management, evapo-transpirative cooling, [[sustainable architecture]], aesthetics, and habitat creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Extensive Vegetative Roofs {{!}} Whole Building Design Guide|url = https://www.wbdg.org/resources/greenroofs.php|website = www.wbdg.org|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Orangerie.jpg|thumb|300px|Orangery at the Palace of Versailles, outside Paris]]
{{Main|History of landscape architecture}}
For the period before 1800, the history of landscape gardening (later called landscape architecture) is largely that of master planning and [[garden design]] for [[manor houses]], [[palace]]s and royal properties, religious complexes, and centers of government. An example is the extensive work by [[André Le Nôtre]] at [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]] for King [[Louis XIV of France]] at the [[Palace of Versailles]]. The first person to write of ''making'' a landscape was [[Joseph Addison]] in 1712. The term landscape architecture was invented by [[Gilbert Laing Meason]] in 1828, and [[John Claudius Loudon]] (1783–1843) was instrumental in the adoption of the term landscape architecture by the modern profession. He took up the term from Meason and gave it publicity in his Encyclopedias and in his 1840 book on the ''Landscape Gardening and Landscape Architecture of the Late Humphry Repton''.&lt;ref&gt;London: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of landscape architecture spread from the Old to the New World. The term "landscape architect" was used as a professional title by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] in the United States in 1863{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} and 
[[Andrew Jackson Downing]] (1815–1852),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6412257 Find a Grave]&lt;/ref&gt; another early American [[landscape designer]], was editor of ''The Horticulturist'' magazine (1846–52). In 1841 his first book, ''A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening, Adapted to North America'', was published to a great success; it was the first book of its kind published in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Horticulture|url=http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hort/history/159.html|publisher=Ohio State University|accessdate=24 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716204051/http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hort/history/159.html|archivedate=16 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the latter 19th century, the term landscape architect begun to be used by professional landscapes designers, and was firmly established after [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]] and [[Beatrix Farrand|Beatrix Jones (later Farrand)]] with others founded the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (ASLA) in 1899. IFLA was founded at [[Cambridge]], [[England]], in 1948 with [[Geoffrey Jellicoe|Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe]] as its first president, representing 15 countries from [[Europe]] and North America. Later, in 1978, IFLA's Headquarters were established in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].&lt;ref name=IFLAbook&gt;IFLA Past, Present, Future - A publication about the history of IFLA. {{ISBN|3-9522080-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/Ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=123501&amp;set=48C9DF56_2_0&amp;gp=0&amp;lin=1 UNCESCO Documents and Publications]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iflaonline.org/ The International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to urban planning==
[[File:Central park photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|right|333px|The combination of the traditional landscape gardening and the emerging city planning combined together gave landscape architecture its unique focus. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]  used the term 'landscape architecture' using the word as a profession for the first time when designing the [[Central Park]]. ]]
Through the 19th century, [[urban planning]] became a focal point and central issue in cities. The combination of the tradition of [[History of gardening|landscape gardening]] and the emerging field of urban planning offered Landscape Architecture an opportunity to serve these needs.&lt;ref&gt;Van Assche, K., Beunen, R., Duineveld, M., &amp; de Jong, H. (2013). Co-evolutions of planning and design: Risks and benefits of design perspectives in planning systems. Planning Theory, 12(2), 177-198.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the century, [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] completed a series of parks which continue to have a huge influence on the practices of Landscape Architecture today. Among these were [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]], [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]] and Boston's [[Emerald Necklace]] park system. [[Jens Jensen (landscape architect)|Jens Jensen]] designed sophisticated and naturalistic urban and regional parks for [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and private estates for the Ford family including [[Fair Lane]] and [[Edsel and Eleanor Ford House|Gaukler Point]]. One of the original ten founding members of the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (ASLA), and the only woman, was [[Beatrix Farrand]]. She was design consultant for over a dozen universities including: [[Princeton University|Princeton]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]; [[Yale]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]; and the [[Arnold Arboretum]] for [[Harvard]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Her numerous private [[estate (land)|estate]] projects include the landmark [[Dumbarton Oaks]] in the [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, other architects — most notably Ruth Havey and Alden Hopkins—changed certain elements of the Farrand design.

Since this period [[Urban Planning]] has developed into a separate independent profession that has incorporated important contributions from other fields such as [[Civil Engineering]], [[Architecture]] and [[Public Administration]]. Urban Planners are qualified to perform tasks independent of landscape architects, and in general, the curriculum of landscape architecture programs do not prepare students to become urban planners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bulletin of Information for the AICP Comprehensive Planning Examination|url=https://planning-org-uploaded-media.s3.amazonaws.com/legacy_resources/certification/pdf/bulletin.pdf#page=13|website = www.planning.org|quote=There are important distinctions between planners and allied professionals and between planning and related fields. Planners approach problems comprehensively, have a long-range perspective, and deal with unique place-based issues. Although people in related professions (e.g., law, architecture, landscape architecture, engineering, real estate development, etc.) and disciplines (humanities, psychology, etc.) often work with planners, they do not necessarily have the same knowledge base, skillset, and approach.
|accessdate = 2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape architecture continues to develop as a design discipline, and to respond to the various movements in architecture and design throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. [[Thomas Dolliver Church|Thomas Church]] was a mid-century landscape architect significant in the profession. [[Roberto Burle Marx]] in [[Brazil]] combined the [[International style (architecture)|International style]] and native Brazilian plants and culture for a new aesthetic. Innovation continues today solving challenging problems with contemporary design solutions for master planning, landscapes, and gardens.

[[Ian McHarg]] was known for introducing environmental concerns in landscape architecture.&lt;ref name=Corbett&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corbett|first1=John|title=Ian McHarg: Overlay Maps and the Evaluation of Social and Environmental Costs of Land Use Change|url=http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/23|publisher=Center for Spatially Integrated Social Science|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ozio&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ozio|first1=Ron|title=Obituary: Ian McHarg Dies|url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/news/university-pennsylvania-prof-ian-mcharg-dies|website=Penn News|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=4 June 2014|date=6 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He popularized a system of analyzing the layers of a site in order to compile a complete understanding of the qualitative attributes of a place. This system became the foundation of today's Geographic Information Systems (GIS). McHarg would give every qualitative aspect of the site a layer, such as the history, hydrology, topography, vegetation, etc.  GIS software is ubiquitously used in the landscape architecture profession today to analyze materials in and on the Earth's surface and is similarly used by Urban Planners, Geographers, Forestry and Natural Resources professionals, etc.

==Profession==
In many countries, a professional [[institute]], comprising members of the professional community, exists in order to protect the standing of the profession and promote its interests, and sometimes also regulate the practice of landscape architecture. The standard and strength of legal regulations governing landscape architecture practice varies from nation to nation, with some requiring licensure in order to practice; and some having little or no regulation. In [[Europe]], [[North America]], parts of [[South America]], [[Australia]], [[India]] and [[New Zealand]], landscape architecture is a regulated profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oala.on.ca |title=The Ontario Association of Landscape Architects |publisher=Oala.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina===
Since 1889, with the arrival of the French architect and urbanist landscaper [[Carlos Thays]], recommended to recreate the National Capital's parks and public gardens, it was consolidated an apprentice and training program in landscaping that eventually became a regulated profession, currently the leading academic institution is the [[University of Buenos Aires|UBA University of Buenos Aires]]''"UBA Facultad de Arquitectura, Diseño y Urbanismo"'' (Faculty of Architecture, Design and Urbanism) offering a Bacherlor’s degree in Urban Landscaping Design and Planning, the profession itself is regulated by the National Ministry of Urban Planning of Argentina and the Institute of the [[Buenos Aires Botanical Garden]].

===Australia===
The [[Australian Institute of Landscape Architects]] (AILA) provides accreditation of university degrees and non statutory professional registration for landscape architects. Once recognized by AILA, landscape architects use the title 'Registered Landscape Architect' across the six states and territories within Australia.

AILA's system of professional recognition is a national system overseen by the AILA National Office in Canberra. To apply for AILA Registration, an applicant usually needs to satisfy a number of pre-requisites, including university qualification, a minimum number years of practice and a record of professional experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aila.org.au/iMIS_Prod/AILAWeb/Become_an_AILA_Member/Join/AILAWeb/Join_or_Renew.aspx?hkey=2d670d90-0f9a-49c9-a901-68bc8fd5ef5e]&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape Architecture within Australia covers a broad spectrum of planning, design, management and research. From specialist design services for government and private sector developments through to specialist professional advice as an expert witness.

===Canada===
In Canada, landscape architecture, like law and medicine, is a self-regulating profession pursuant to provincial statute.  For example, Ontario's profession is governed by the Ontario Association of Landscape Architects pursuant to the ''Ontario Association of Landscape Architects Act''.  Landscape architects in Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta must complete the specified components of L.A.R.E (Landscape Architecture Registration Examination) as a prerequisite to full professional standing.

Provincial regulatory bodies are members of a national organization, the [[Canadian Society of Landscape Architects|Canadian Society of Landscape Architects / L'Association des Architectes Paysagistes du Canada]] (CSLA-AAPC), and individual membership in the CSLA-AAPC is obtained through joining one of the provincial or territorial components.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csla-aapc.ca/csla-aapc Canadian Society of Landscape Architects Official Site - English]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
AIAPP (Associazione Italiana Architettura del Paesaggio) is the Italian association of professional landscape architects formed in 1950 and is a member of IFLA and IFLA Europe (formerly known as EFLA). AIAPP is in the process of contesting this new law which has given the Architects' Association the new title of Architects, Landscape Architects, Planners and Conservationists whether or not they have had any training or experience in any of these fields other than Architecture.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
In Italy, there are several different professions involved in landscape architecture:
*Architects
*Landscape designers
*Doctor landscape agronomists and Doctor landscape foresters, often called Landscape agronomists.
*Agrarian Experts and Graduated Agrarian experts.

===New Zealand===
The New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects (NZILA) is the professional body for Landscape Architects in NZ [http://www.nzila.co.nz www.nzila.co.nz].

In April 2013, NZILA jointly with AILA, hosted the 50th International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA) World Congress in Auckland, New Zealand.  The World Congress is an international conference where Landscape Architects from all around the globe meet to share ideas around a particular topic.

Within NZ, Members of NZILA when they achieve their professional standing, can use the title Registered Landscape Architect NZILA.

NZILA provides an education policy and an accreditation process to review education programme providers; currently there are three accredited undergraduate Landscape Architecture programmes in New Zealand. Lincoln University also has an accredited masters programme in landscape architecture.

===Republic of Ireland===
The Irish Landscape Institute [ILI] (www.irishlandscapeinstitute.com) is the officially recognized (by the Irish State) professional body representing landscape architects and parks professionals, in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The ILI was formed in 1992 by the merger of the ILHI (Institute of Landscape Horticulture of Ireland) and the IILA (Irish Institute of Landscape Architects), representing the related disciplines of landscape architecture and landscape horticulture. The Institute currently (October 2017) has a total membership of 160 (approx.) within 7 membership categories (student, graduate, affiliate, parks professional, corporate, fellow, honorary). In the absence of state regulation of the profession or title 'landscape architect', ILI is self-regulating, as for example in its adoption of the trade-marked title, 'Registered Landscape Architect', that is solely permissible for use by corporate members.

At international level, the ILI is a full member of the International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA) through its European Region (IFLA-Europe). The ILI has play a consistent and active role in IFLA and the current president of IFLA-Europe is Irishman and ILI Past President, Mr. Tony Williams MILI.
In the Republic of Ireland, the ILI is a member institute of the Urban Forum, which represents 5 built-environment professional bodies in engineering, architecture, planning, quantity surveying and landscape architecture.

ILI promotes the landscape profession by its accreditation of the master's degree programme in University College Dublin, its certification of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for its members, administration of professional practice examinations, advocacy and lobbying in respect of government policies, guidelines and standards (e.g. the National Landscape Strategy, National Planning Framework, Blue-Green Infrastructure), conferences and seminars, public lectures and design awards.

The profession grew rapidly during the Irish economic boom of the early 21st. century, benefiting from the upsurge in the construction and development sectors and from the States' capital investment in infrastructure. The recession brought a sharp reduction in membership numbers. The profession and ILI has proven resilient with clear evidence of a slow but steady recovery through growth in membership and in employment, since the commencement of economic recovery in 2014.

A key challenge remains: there is still no professional regulation or protection registration of title in Ireland, despite calls for such on successive government by ILI over many years. Therefore, there is no state-guarantee or protection of clients, for example in terms of insuring and verifying educational qualifications, professional indemnity insurance or Continuing Professional Development (CPD) of those claiming to be landscape architects. Notwithstanding this, there is a growing awareness in some important sectors (e.g. government departments, media, construction, tourism) of the profession. This is due - to some degree - to the ongoing work of the ILI in promoting the benefits of landscape architecture to Irish society, economy and environment.

Landscape architects in Ireland work in private practice, public sector bodies at local government level and in some state bodies (e.g. transport, national heritage) and in academia. The demand for their professional services is often associated with public infrastructure projects (e.g. roads, motorways, renewable energy facilities, water treatment plants, etc.), Blue-Green Infrastructure (planning, design and management of parks, greenspaces, amenity trees) and with construction projects related to land use developments, principally residential, commercial and mixed-use developments in urban landscapes.

Landscape architects are employed in design of:  green infrastructure, public realm, institutional/medical/industrial campuses and settings, parks, play facilities, transport (road/rail/cycle/port) corridors, retail complexes, residential estates (including plans for remediation of now-abandoned housing 'ghost' estates), village improvements, accessibility audits, graveyard restoration schemes, wind farms, wetland drainage systems and coastal zones.
They are also significantly employed in preparation/review of statutory impact assessment reports on landscape, visual and ecological impacts of planning proposals.

=== South Africa ===
In May 1962, Joane Pim, Ann Sutton, Peter Leutscher and Roelf Botha (considered the forefathers of the profession in South Africa) established the Institute for Landscape Architects, now known as the Institute for Landscape Architecture in South Africa (ILASA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilasa.co.za/&lt;/ref&gt; ILASA is a voluntary organisation registered with the South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession. It consists of three regional bodies namely, Gauteng, KwaZula-Natal and the Western Cape. ILASA’s mission is to advance the profession of landscape architecture and uphold high standards of professional service to its members, and to represent the profession of landscape architecture in any matter which may affect the interests of the members of the Institute. ILASA holds the country’s membership with The International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA).

In South Africa, the profession is regulated by The South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession (SACLAP),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saclap.org.za/&lt;/ref&gt; established as a statutory council in terms of Section 2 of the South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession Act – Act 45 of 2000. The Council evolved out of the Board of Control for Landscape Architects (BOCLASA), which functioned under the Council of Architects in terms of The Architectural Act, Act 73 of 1970. SACLAP’s mission is to establish, direct, sustain and ensure a high level of professional responsibilities and ethical conduct within the art and science of landscape architecture with honesty, dignity and integrity in the broad interest of public health, safety and welfare of the community.

After completion of an accredited under-graduate and/or post-graduate qualification in landscape architecture at either the [[University of Cape Town]] or the [[University of Pretoria]], or landscape technology at the [[Cape Peninsula University of Technology]], professional registration is attained via a mandatory mentored candidacy period (minimum of two years) and sitting of the professional registration exam. After successfully completing the exam, the individual is entitled to the status of Professional Landscape Architect or Professional Landscape Technologist.We also can study landscape architect in various FET institution.

===United Kingdom===
The UK's professional body is the [[Landscape Institute]] (LI). It is a [[charter]]ed body which accredits landscape professionals and university courses. At present there are fifteen accredited programmes in the UK. Membership of the LI is available to students, academics and professionals, and there are over 3,000 professionally qualified members.

The Institute provides services to assist members including support and promotion of the work of landscape architects; information and guidance to the public and industry about the specific expertise offered by those in the profession; and training and educational advice to students and professionals looking to build upon their experience.

In 2008, the LI launched a major recruitment drive entitled "I want to be a Landscape Architect" to encourage the study of Landscape Architecture. The campaign aims to raise the profile of landscape architecture and highlight its valuable role in building [[sustainable communities]] and fighting [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.landscapeinstitute.org/media/CCPositionStatement.php |title=CC Position Statement |first= |last= |work=landscapeinstitute.org |year=2011 |accessdate=30 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613043428/http://www.landscapeinstitute.org/media/CCPositionStatement.php |archivedate=13 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

In the United States, Landscape Architecture is regulated by individual state governments. For a landscape architect, obtaining licensure requires advanced education and work experience, plus passage of the national examination called [[The Landscape Architect Registration Examination (L.A.R.E.)]]. Several states require passage of a state exam as well. In the United States licensing is overseen both at the state level, and nationally by the Council of Landscape Architectural Registration Boards (CLARB).  Landscape architecture has been identified as an above-average growth profession by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and was listed in ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'''s list of Best Jobs to Have in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.usnews.com/money/careers/articles/2009/12/28/landscape-architect-2.html |title=Career Advice and Guide for Job Searches - US News Business |publisher=Money.usnews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national trade association for United States landscape architects is the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]].

| Its significance for the biblical version of Israel's past, particularly in lines 8 and 9, which mention a "king of Israel" and a "[[Davidic line|house of David]]". The latter is generally understood by scholars to refer to the ruling dynasty of Judah. Although the meaning of this phrase has  been disputed by the  minority of scholars,{{sfn|Rainey|1994|p=47}} today it is generally accepted as a reference to [[Davidic dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Grabbe, Lester L. (2007-04-28). Ahab Agonistes: The Rise and Fall of the Omri Dynasty. Bloomsbury Publishing USA. {{ISBN|9780567251718}}. "The Tel Dan inscription generated a good deal of debate and a flurry of articles when it first appeared, but it is now widely regarded (a) as genuine and (b) as referring to the Davidic dynasty and the Aramaic kingdom of Damascus."&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, after much further discussion in academic journals, it is accepted by most archaeologists that the inscription is not only genuine but that the reference is indeed to the House of David, thus representing the first allusion found anywhere outside the Bible to the biblical David.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mykytiuk, Lawrence J.

==Other significant artifacts==

===2000 BCE===
* [[Creation myth]]s and [[flood myth]]s – recorded on the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], the [[Atra-Hasis]] tablets, the [[Enûma Eliš]], the [[Sumerian creation myth|Eridu Genesis]] and the [[Barton Cylinder]]
* [[List of ancient legal codes|Law tablets]] – ancient Near East legal tablets: [[Code of Hammurabi]], [[Laws of Eshnunna]], the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]], king of [[Ur]] (ca. 2050 BCE), the [[Laws of Eshnunna]] (ca. 1930 BCE) and the codex of [[Lipit-Ishtar]] of [[Isin]] (ca. 1870 BCE).&lt;ref name="yale2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hammint.htm |title=The Code of Hammurabi: Introduction |accessdate=14 September 2007 |publisher=Yale University |year=1915 |author=Charles F.

(see [[Cuneiform law]]).
* [[Hittite texts]] and [[Nuzi Texts|Nuzi texts]] (17th century BCE and later)
* [[Minoan Eruption]] – pumice found at various Tels dated to Late Bronze Age
* [[Execration texts]] – earliest references to many Biblical locations
* [[Shiphrah]] slave list – Shiphrah was one of two midwives who helped prevent the [[genocide]] of Hebrew children by the Egyptians, according to the [[Book of Exodus]] 1:15–21. The name is found in a list of [[slavery|slaves]] in Egypt during the reign of [[Sobekhotep III]]. This list is on Brooklyn 35.1446, a papyrus scroll kept in the [[Brooklyn Museum]].

===1500 BCE===
* Tombs of [[Ahmose, son of Ebana]] and [[Ahmose Pen-Nekhebet]], record the earliest records of Egyptian control of Canaan. The Bible's depiction of Israel does not allow for Egyptian control over the area. {{citation needed|reason=Contradiction not apparent or obvious|date=December 2015}}
* [[Amarna letters]] (c. 13th century BCE) – correspondence on clay tablets between the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] administration and various Middle East kings petty sub-rulers in [[Canaan]] during the New Kingdom. The Bible's depiction of Canaan at this time (the period of the Judges) contradicts these records. {{citation needed|reason=Contradiction not apparent or obvious|date=December 2015}}
* [[Great Hymn to the Aten]] is seen to possess strong similarities to [[Psalm 104]], which may be based on it.
* [[Admonitions of Ipuwer|Ipuwer Papyrus]] (probably 18th century BCE) – poem describing Egypt as afflicted by natural disasters and in a state of chaos. The archeological evidence does not support the story of [[the Exodus]], and most histories of ancient Israel no longer consider it relevant to the story of Israel's emergence.{{sfn|Meyers|2005|p=5-6}}{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=81}} Nevertheless, Ipuwer is often put forward in popular literature as confirmation of the Biblical account, most notably because of its statement that "the river is blood" and its frequent references to servants running away. This ignores the many points on which Ipuwer contradicts Exodus, such as the fact that its Asiatics are arriving in Egypt rather than leaving, and the likelihood that the "river is blood" phrase may refer to the red sediment colouring the Nile during disastrous floods, or may simply be a poetic image of turmoil.{{sfn|Enmarch|2011|p=173-175}}
* North Wall of the [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu temple]] and the [[Papyrus Harris]] (c. 1150 BCE) – depicts the [[Ramesses III]]'s conquests in Canaan including the [[Battle of Djahy]]. This is not reflected in the Biblical history.

===10th century BCE===
[[File:Gezer calendar close up.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Gezer calendar]] in the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]].]]
*Early [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|Paleo-Hebrew writing]] – contenders for the earliest Hebrew inscriptions include the [[Gezer calendar]], [[Ostracon#Biblical period ostraca|Biblical period ostraca]] at [[Valley of Elah|Elah]] and [[Isbeth Sartah|Izbet Sartah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/uncategorized/what%E2%80%99s-the-oldest-hebrew-inscription/|title=What's the Oldest Hebrew Inscription?

*[[Pim weight]] – evidence of the use of an ancient source for the [[Book of Samuel]] due to the use of an archaic term.
*[[Khirbet Qeiyafa#Khirbet Qeiyafa inscription|Khirbet Qeiyafa pottery sherd]] – (10th century BCE) inscription – both the language it was written in and the translation are disputed.

However, Israelite and Judaean History, Old Testament Library. Edited by John H. Hayes and J. Maxwell Miller. London: SCM Press, 1977 says, "Recently, Na'aman [Nadav Na'aman. "Sennacherib's 'Letter to God' on His Campaign to Judah," BASOR CCXIV (1974) 25–39] has shown conclusively that the fragment presumably mentioning Azriau king of Yaudi actually belongs to the time of Sennacherib and refers not to Azariah but to Hezekiah. In Tiglath-Pileser's annals there are two references to an Azariah (in line 123 as Az-ri-a-[u] and in line 131 as Az-r-ja-a-í) but neither of these make any reference to his country. Thus the Azriau of Tiglath-pileser's annals and Azariah of the Bible should be regarded as two different individuals. Azriau's country cannot, at the present, be determined." Na'aman separates the country (Yaudi) from the name Azriau (p. 36). Also p. 28 on line 5 where the original transcription was "[I]zri-ja-u mat Ja-u-di" he reads "ina birit misrija u mat Jaudi". However, Kitchen, On the Reliability of the Old Testament (OROT), p. 18, is less dogmatic. He says "Hence we cannot certainly assert that this Azriau (without a named territory!) is Azariah of Judah; the matter remains open and undecided for the present and probably unlikely." See Also CAH, 3:35–36."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5D5GNju1-ggC&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''In Search of "Ancient Israel": A Study in Biblical Origins''] Philip R.

===1st century BCE===
*[[Western Wall]] – (c. 19 BCE) is an important Jewish religious site located in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]].

The curve shows the diode response (I vs V&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;) while the straight line shows the behaviour of the linear part of the circuit: I=(V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt;-V&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;)/R. The point of intersection gives the actual current and voltage.]]

In graphical analysis of [[linear circuit|nonlinear]] [[electronic circuit]]s, a '''load line''' is a line drawn on the [[current-voltage characteristic|characteristic curve]], a graph of the [[electric current|current]] vs the [[voltage]] in a nonlinear device like a [[diode]] or [[transistor]].  It represents the constraint put on the voltage and current in the nonlinear device by the external circuit.  The load line, usually a straight line, represents the response of the [[linear circuit|linear]] part of the circuit, connected to the nonlinear device in question.  The points where the characteristic curve and the load line intersect are the possible operating point(s) ([[Q point]]s) of the circuit; at these points the current and voltage parameters of both parts of the circuit match.&lt;ref&gt;Adel Sedra, Kenneth Smith. Microelectronic Circuits, 5th ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

The example at right shows how a load line is used to determine the current and voltage in a simple [[diode]] circuit.  The diode, a nonlinear device, is in series with a linear circuit consisting of a [[resistor]], R and a [[voltage]] source, V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt;.  The characteristic curve ''(curved line)'', representing the current ''I'' through the diode for any given voltage across the diode ''V''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;, is an exponential curve.   The load line ''(diagonal line)'' represents the relationship between current and voltage due to [[Kirchhoff's voltage law]] applied to the resistor and voltage source, is
:&lt;math&gt;V_D = V_{DD} - I R \,&lt;/math&gt;
Since the current going through the three elements in series must be the same, and the voltage at the terminals of the diode must be the same,  the operating point of the circuit will be at the intersection of the curve with the load line.

In a [[Bipolar junction transistor|BJT]] circuit, the BJT has a different current-voltage (I&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;-V&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt;) characteristic depending on the base current. Placing a series of these curves on the graph shows how the base current will affect the operating point of the circuit.

==DC and AC load lines==
[[Semiconductor]] circuits typically have both [[direct current|DC]] and [[alternating current|AC]] currents in them, with a source of DC current to [[biasing|bias]] the nonlinear semiconductor to the correct operating point, and the AC signal superimposed on the DC.  Load lines can be used separately for both DC and AC analysis.  The DC load line is the load line of the DC [[equivalent circuit]],  defined by reducing the reactive components to zero (replacing capacitors by open circuits and inductors by short circuits).  It is used to determine the correct DC operating point, often called the  [[biasing|Q point]].

Once a DC operating point is defined by the DC load line, an AC load line can be drawn through the Q point.  The AC load line is a straight line with a slope equal to the AC [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] facing the nonlinear device, which is in general different from the DC resistance.  The ratio of AC voltage to current in the device is defined by this line.    Because the impedance of the reactive components will vary with frequency, the slope of the  AC load line depends on the frequency of the applied signal.  So there are many AC load lines, that vary from the DC load line (at low frequency)  to a limiting AC load line,  all having a common intersection at the DC operating point. This limiting load line, generally referred to as the ''AC load line'', is the load line of the circuit at "infinite frequency", and can be found by replacing capacitors with short circuits, and inductors with open circuits.

== Load lines for common configurations ==

=== Transistor load line  ===
[[File:BJT CE load line.svg|right|400px|Illustration of load line for a common emitter bipolar junction transistor amplifier.  ]]

The load line diagram at right is for a resistive load in a [[common emitter]] circuit.  The load line shows how the collector load resistor (R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) constrains the circuit voltage and current.  The diagram also plots the transistor's collector current ''I''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; versus collector voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt; for different values of base current ''I''&lt;sub&gt;base&lt;/sub&gt;.  The intersections of the load line with the transistor characteristic curves represent the circuit-constrained values of ''I''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt; at different base currents. &lt;ref name=MY73&gt; Maurice Yunik, ''Design of Modern Transistor Circuits'', Prentice-Hall Inc., 1973 {{ISBN|0-13-201285-5}} section 4.6 "Load Line Analysis" pp. 68-73 &lt;/ref&gt;

If the transistor could pass all the current available, with no voltage dropped across it, the collector current would be the supply voltage V &lt;sub&gt;CC &lt;/sub&gt;over R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. This is the point where the load line crosses the vertical axis. Even at saturation, however, there will always be some voltage from collector to emitter. 

Where the load line crosses the horizontal axis, the transistor current is minimum (approximately zero). The transistor is said to be cut off, passing only a very small leakage current, and so very nearly the entire supply voltage appears as V&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt;.

The ''operating point'' of the circuit in this configuration (labelled Q) is generally designed to be in the ''active region'', approximately in the middle of the load line for [[amplifier]] applications. Adjusting the base current so that the circuit is at this operating point with no signal applied  is called [[Bipolar transistor biasing|biasing the transistor]]. Several techniques are used to stabilize the operating point against minor changes in temperature or transistor operating characteristics. When a signal is applied, the base current varies, and the collector-emitter voltage in turn varies, following the load line - the result is an amplifier stage with gain. 

A load line is normally drawn on I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;-V&lt;sub&gt;ce&lt;/sub&gt; characteristics curves for the transistor used in an amplifier circuit. The same technique is applied to other types of non-linear elements such as [[vacuum tube]]s or [[field effect transistor]]s.

'''Malacology'''&lt;ref&gt;From French ''malacologie'', contraction of malacozoologie, from [[New Latin]] Malacozoa "zoological group including soft-bodied animals" from Greek [[wikt:μαλακός|μαλακός]] - ''malakos'' "soft" + [[wikt:ζῷον|ζῷον]] "animal.&lt;/ref&gt; is the branch of [[invertebrate]] [[zoology]] that deals with the study of the [[Mollusca]] (mollusks or molluscs), the second-largest [[phylum]] of animals in terms of described [[species]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/malacology/|title=Home - Division of Invertebrate Zoology|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208135845/http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/malacology/|archivedate=2007-02-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the [[arthropod]]s. Mollusks include [[snail]]s and [[slug]]s, [[clam]]s, [[octopus]] and [[squid]], and numerous other kinds, many of which have [[mollusc shell|shells]]. One division of malacology, [[conchology]], is devoted to the study of mollusk shells. Malacology derives from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|μαλακός}}, ''malakos'', "soft"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]''.

Fields within malacological research include [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[ecology]] and [[evolution]]. Applied malacology studies medical, veterinary, and agricultural applications, for example mollusks as vectors of disease, as in [[schistosomiasis]].

[[Archaeology]] employs malacology to understand the evolution of the [[climate]], the biota of the area, and the usage of the site.

In 1681, [[Filippo Bonanni]] wrote the first book ever published that was solely about seashells, the shells of marine mollusks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansp.org/museum/digital_collections/shells/bounanni.php |title=Buonanni's Chiocciole (1681) |work=ansp.org |accessdate=8 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322225631/http://www.ansp.org/museum/digital_collections/shells/bounanni.php |archivedate=22 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was entitled: ''Ricreatione dell' occhio e dela mente nell oservation' delle Chiociolle, proposta a' curiosi delle opere della natura, &amp;c.''&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [[Filippo Bonanni|Bonanni F.]] 1681.

Zoological methods are used in malacological research. Malacological field methods and laboratory methods (such as collecting, documenting and archiving, and molecular techniques) were summarized by Sturm et al. (2006).&lt;ref name="Dillon R.

The '''Martindale''' is a unit for quantifying the [[abrasion resistance]] of [[textiles]], especially when used for [[upholstery]].

The '''Martindale method''', also known as the '''Martindale rub test''', simulates natural wear of a [[seat]] cover, in which the textile sample is rubbed against a standard [[abrasive]] surface with a specified force. The test equipment works in intervals of 5000 cycles, totalling the ''wear number'' (unit: Martindale) of abrasion cycles that leads to the material being worn to a specified degree. The higher the value, the more resistant the material is to abrasion.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.uni.edu/csbs/sites/default/files/Abrasion_Resistance-Martindale.pdf Abrasion Resistance by the Martindale Method ASTM D4966-98 Standard Test Method for Abrasion Resistance of Textile Fabrics (Martindale Abrasion Tester Method)]'' (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

The national German textile institute specifies a minimum requirement for various applications, and here are some examples:
{| class="wikitable"
!  !!Soft padding &lt;br /&gt;[Martindale] !! Hard padding &lt;br /&gt;[Martindale]
|-
| Private use || 10,000 || 15,000
|-
| Office use || 25,000 || 35,000
|-
| For [[public transportation]] || 30,000 || 40,000
|}
Consoles for use by police or emergency services may require values of 200,000 to 500,000.  

In the US, the [[Wyzenbeek]] test is often used instead of the Martindale.

The Martindale machine also tests for [[Pill (textile)|fabric pilling]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6693">'''Mesowear''' is a method, used in different branches and fields of [[biology]]. This method can apply to both [[Extant taxon|extant]] and [[extinct]] animals, according to the scope of the study. Mesowear is based on studying an animal's tooth wearing fingerprint. In brief, each animal has special feeding habits, which cause unique tooth wearing. Rough feeds cause serious tooth abrasion, while smooth one triggers moderate abrasion, so browsers have teeth with moderate abrasion and grazers have teeth with rough abrasion. Scoring systems can quantify tooth abrasion observations and ease comparisons between individuals.

== Mesowear definition==

The '''mesowear''' method or tooth wear scoring method &lt;ref&gt;Clauss, M; Franz-Odendaal, T A; Brasch, J; Castell, J C; Kaiser, T (2007). Tooth wear in captive giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis): mesowear analysis classifies free-ranging specimens as browsers but captive ones as grazers. Journal of Zoo and Wildlife Medicine, 38(3):433-445.[http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&amp;doi=10.1638%2F06-032.1]&lt;/ref&gt; is a quick and inexpensive process of determining the lifelong [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] of a taxon ([[Grazing|grazer]] or [[Browsing (predation)|browser]]) and was first introduced in the year 2000.
The mesowear technique can be extended to [[extinct]] and also [[Extant taxon|extant]] animals.
Mesowear analyses require large [[Sample (statistics)|sample populations]] (&gt;20), which can be problematic for some localities, but the method yields an accurate depiction of an animal's average lifelong diet.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, J. M. 2006. [http://etd.fcla.edu/UF/UFE0017840/hoffman_j.pdf "Using stable carbon isotope, microwear and mesowear analysis to determine paleodiets of neogene ungulates and the presence of c&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or c&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; grasses in northern and central florida"]&lt;/ref&gt; mesowear analysis, is based on the physical properties of [[ungulate]] foods as reflected in the relative amounts of  [[Attrition (dental)|attritive]] and [[abrasive]] wear that they cause on the [[Tooth|dental]] [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] of the [[occlusion (dentistry)|occlusal]] surfaces. Mesowear was recorded by examining the [[Cheek|buccal]] apices of [[molar tooth]] [[cusp (dentistry)|cusps]]. Apices were characterized as sharp, rounded, or blunt, and the valleys between them either high or low. The method has been developed only for [[selenodont]] and [[trilophodont]] molars, but the principle is readily extendable to other crown types.In collecting the data the teeth are inspected at close range,  a hand lens will be used. Mesowear analysis is insensitive to wear stage as long as the very early and very late stages are excluded.&lt;ref&gt;Fortelius, M., N. Solounias. 2000. [http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1206/0003-0082(2000)301%3C0001:FCOUMU%3E2.0.CO%3B2 "Functional Characterization of Ungulate Molars Using the Abrasion-Attrition Wear Gradient: A New Method for Reconstructing Paleodiets" ]&lt;/ref&gt;
Mesowear [[analysis]] follows [[Technical standard|standard]] [[Protocol (natural sciences)|protocols]]. [[Biological specimen|Specimens]] are [[Digital data|digitally]] photographed in [[lip|labial]] [[Perspective (visual)|view]] so that cusp shape and [[occlusion (dentistry)|occlusal]] [[relief]] can be scored.&lt;ref&gt;Croft, D. A., D. Weinstein. 2008. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V6R-4T8HHN0-2&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1172710257&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=1a86b111a6b5bfded8a0637dc120b148 "The first application of the mesowear method to endemic South American ungulates (Notoungulata) "]&lt;/ref&gt;

In collecting the data the teeth are inspected at close range, using a hand lens.
Gravity toward lower teeth causes more abrasion on lower teeth than upper theeth. This fact is base of mesowear method&lt;ref&gt;Tamara, A. Franz-Odendaal. T. M. Kaisser. 2003. [http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anzf40/anzf40-395.pdf Differential mesowear in the maxillary and mandibular cheek dentition of some artiodactyls]. Ann. Zool. Fennici 40: 395–410&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shape definition ==
'''sharp''': A sharp cusp terminates to a point and has practically no rounded area between the 	 
mesial and distal phase I facets,
 
'''Round''': a rounded cusp has a distinctly rounded tip (apex) without planar
facet wear but retains facets on the lower slopes.

'''Blunt''': blunt cusp lacks distinct facets altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser. T.M. 2003. [http://webapp5.rrz.uni-hamburg.de/mammals/PDF/Kaiser_Solounias_2003.pdf" Extending the tooth mesowear method to extinct and extant equids" ]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Terminology ==
The [[attrition (dental)|attrition]]: this kind of  dental wearing is as a result of rubbing tooth to tooth and no external forces cause this enamel abrasion.usually browsers feed contains less food abrasive materials( such as [[silica]] because of feed selecting behavior in this animals so wearing type of browser ungulates will be this type in most cases.

The [[Abrasion (dental)|abrasion]]: rubbing food to tooth triggers this kind of tooth wearing more visible for grazer animals than browsers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1333">'''National Share-a-Story Month''' (NSSM) is an annual event in the [[United Kingdom]] that is used to promote [[reading (process)|reading]] to [[children]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.national-awareness-days.com/national-share-a-story-month.html|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used by librarians, schools, the book industry, bloggers and parents as a way to focus on storytelling in the broadest of senses. Local groups of [[The Federation of Children's Book Groups]] often hold special events to celebrate the month, such as author visits, book readings and other activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordsforlife.org.uk/once-upon-story|title=Words for Life: National Share a Story month|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The NSSM has originated as National Tell-A-Story Week in 1974, the idea of Pat Triggs, Vice-Chair of [[The Federation of Children's Book Groups]] at the time. In 1998 it was decided to extend the idea to one month and the event became the National Share-A-Story Month.

'''''Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus''''' is a [[Platform game|platform video game]] developed by [[Oddworld Inhabitants]] and published by [[GT Interactive]]. Although the game is a sequel to the video game ''[[Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee]]'', it is considered a spin-off title in the ''Oddworld'' series, and not part of the main ''[[Oddworld|Oddworld Quintology]]''. It was released in November 1998 for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] [[video game console]] and [[Microsoft Windows]].&lt;ref name="FactSheet"&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|title=Oddworld Fact Sheet|url=http://www.oddworld.com/firsttenyears/oddworld/company/ow_keyfacts.shtml|work=Oddworld Inhabitants|accessdate=October 6, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216004306/http://oddworld.com/firsttenyears/oddworld/company/ow_keyfacts.shtml|archivedate=December 16, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/ps/action/oddworldabesexoddus/similar.html?mode=versions|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715050244/http://uk.gamespot.com/ps/action/oddworldabesexoddus/similar.html?mode=versions|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-15|title=Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus - Related Games|publisher=[[GameSpot]] UK|accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was re-released on the [[PlayStation Network]] in October 2009.

The game continues the story of [[Abe (Oddworld)|Abe]], charting his efforts to save his fellow Mudokons from another plot by the Glukkons to exploit them. Abe discovers that the Glukkons are enslaving Mudokons, this time to produce a drink called Soulstorm Brew, which uses Mudokon bones and tears as its ingredients. The player assumes the role of Abe, embarking on a quest to halt production of SoulStorm Brew.

The game was released to similar critical acclaim as the first title. Reviews praised the game's ability to allow the player to [[Saved game#Save states|quick save]]&lt;!-- a quick save is a common thing, no need for the game's own QuikSave spelling --&gt; anywhere they liked, a feature that was not present in ''Abe's Oddysee'', while noting that it was very similar to that title.&lt;ref name="Review1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lauren Fielder|date=November 25, 1998|title=GameSpot review of Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/ps/action/oddworldabesexoddus/review.html|publisher=GameSpot UK|accessdate=August 4, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214100548/http://uk.gamespot.com/ps/action/oddworldabesexoddus/review.html|archivedate=February 14, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game won multiple awards upon release.&lt;ref name="AwardsList"&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards List for Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus|url=http://www.oddworld.com/firsttenyears/oddworld/company/ow_awards_ae.shtml|work=[[Oddworld Inhabitants]]|accessdate=September 5, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006094518/http://www.oddworld.com/firsttenyears/oddworld/company/ow_awards_ae.shtml|archivedate=October 6, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 14, 2016, it was announced that [[Oddworld Inhabitants]] are working on a follow-up to ''[[Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty!]]'' (a 2014 ''Abe's Oddysee'' remake) titled ''[[Oddworld: Soulstorm]]''. The game page confirms that this title is inspired by ''Abe's Exoddus'' and that the new game is going to be a re-tale of ''Abe's Exoddus''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oddworld.com/soulstorm/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Abe's Exoddus'' is a [[two-dimensional]] platform game, with many of its elements taken from the previous title, ''Abe's Oddysee''. The game is split into screens; when the player moves into the edge of the screen, the environment is replaced, just like in the previous title. Most screens include various puzzles that must be solved through the use of Abe's unique abilities: "GameSpeak", possession, controlling mine cars, activation or deactivation of mines or levers, and rocks, grenades, or bones that can be picked up and used for different purposes. Normal abilities include creeping, walking, running, rolling, hoisting, jumping, and crouching, all of which have specific application and make up a necessary arsenal of moves.

The game features no [[graphical user interface|user interface]] or [[HUD (computer gaming)|heads-up display]]. Information is conveyed to the player through instructive screens that can be activated by the player character, or through scrolling messages in the background. Characters do not have [[hit point]]s; instead, being attacked (such as being shot or mauled) generally causes instant death. However, the player has unlimited lives, and upon death will [[Spawn point|re-spawn]] at the last [[Save point|checkpoint]] they reached. ''Abe's Exoddus'' includes an option to [[Saved game#Save states|quick save]]&lt;!-- a quick save is a common thing, no need for the game's own QuikSave spelling --&gt; which allows the player to designate their own checkpoints, a feature which was not present in ''Abe's Oddysee'' due to programming conflicts and which attracted criticism of that title.&lt;ref name="GOGEditorial"&gt;{{cite web|author=David Craddock |date=December 29, 2008 |title=GOG.com Editorial of Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus |url=http://www.gog.com/news/editorial_oddworld_abes_exoddus |work=GOG.com |accessdate=November 17, 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122093946/http://www.gog.com/news/editorial_oddworld_abes_exoddus |archivedate=January 22, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the focus of the gameplay is surmounting screens, there is a secondary focus on rescuing enslaved Mudokons. GameSpeak is a pivotal ability in this respect; by pressing combinations of buttons, the player character will utter short phrases that can be used to control allied [[non-player character]]s—to pull extra levers, to follow the player character,or simply to wait.

[[Image:AbesExoddusScreen1.jpg|thumb|left|Abe and some Mudokons sneak past a sleeping Slig.]]

Unlike the first game, Mudokons have emotional states and status ailments that affect how they respond to Abe. Mudokons may be angry, wired, [[Depression (mood)|depressed]], sick, or blind, and each state must be dealt with differently by the player. Angry, wired or depressed characters can be consoled through specific GameSpeak commands. An "angry" Mudokon (red) will either repeatedly slap nearby Mudokons or work dangerous traps and can be told to "stop it" though Abe must tell them he is "sorry" to calm them down. If a "depressed" Mudokon (blue) witnesses too many deaths of other Mudokons or if he is slapped, he will start to hit himself in the head and eventually commit suicide. Abe again can prevent this by saying "stop it" and remove the ailment by telling them he's "sorry". Both angry and depressed Mudokons will not follow Abe if he tells them to. Clouds of laughing gas will turn Mudokons "wired" (lime), causing them to hyperactively run in Abe's direction and in some cases make it harder to get past enemies and obstacles. They will only calm down when slapped but the slap will have no effect if done within the gas cloud. "Sick" Mudokons will not respond to any GameSpeak command whatsoever (aside from being slapped) and can only be cured with a special chant, obtained when Abe finds a helper character. Blind Mudokons (distinguished by pale skin and with their eyes sewn shut) will keep walking in the direction of Abe's voice, and must be told to "wait" before they walk into a hazard.

[[Spiritual possession|Possession]] is the player character's ability to take control of certain characters in the same screen by chanting. When a character is possessed, the player can use their abilities and weapons to find otherwise unreachable areas or levers, kill enemies, or as part of solving puzzles. However, when possessing a character, the player character remains immobile and vulnerable to attack. Possessing a slig in particular sometimes has to use voice commands to solve puzzles. This is done with an "Ackack!" which the game refers to as 'BS' "Ay!" which is referred to in the game as 'S'BS' and a laugh. The whistling passwords have been removed from the previous game.

The player can abandon possession of a creature at any time. Scrabs or Paramites will be released without harm when abandoned, while Industrialists (Sligs and Glukkons) will burst into pieces. If the player character has drunk Soulstorm Brew, they will be able to possess their own [[flatulence|fart]], which can then be used as a flying explosive and will detonate either when control is abandoned, or after a period of time.

Slave Mudokons (including blind ones) are rescued through Bird Portals. If the player character chants when in the same screen as a Bird Portal, the portal will activate, and any nearby Mudokon slaves will run through it, disappearing. Rescuing Mudokons is not usually crucial to progressing through the game; however, rescuing at least 150 is necessary to get the good ending, and many secret areas revolve around rescuing a few Mudokons in particularly complex situations. There is an alternative ending known as the 'Maximum Casualties' ending. If the player kills all 278 Mudokons, the player is awarded with invincibility.

The player can also gain the ability to turn into the Shrykull, a Mudokon supernatural demigod. Abe acquired this power at a late stage in ''Abe's Oddysee''. The ability is earned by sending a certain number of Mudokons through a bird portal at once, denoted by a number circulating with the birds. With the ability, the player can enter a screen with enemies or explosives, chant to transform into the Shrykull, and vaporize all enemies and hazards on the screen. Afterward, the player character turns back into Mudokon form. Achieving the ability and doing such is necessary to get past certain points in the game. The player can only turn into the Shrykull once each time they earn the ability, so where and when they choose to use it is important.&lt;ref name="GOGEditorial"/&gt;

===Allies, enemies and wildlife===
Allies in the game include Mudokons, humanoid species encountered as rescuable slaves and helpers. Normally, they will follow any GameSpeak-given order, but as described above, some Mudokons will be emotional and must be consoled by the player character first. The player character can also possess other creatures, in order to gain help with a task. For example, when possessing a [[Paramite]], the player character can use GameSpeak to communicate with other Paramites, in much the same way as Mudokons. Scrabs also have minor abilities of GameSpeak, but are limited to shrilling, which activates the ability to attack.

Enemies in the game primarily consist of Sligs, semi-robotic creatures who will attempt to kill the player character on sight. Although most have mechanical legs and carry [[machine gun]]s, some Sligs wear helicopter flight packs and launch [[grenade]]s. Some Sligs choose to sleep without wearing mechanical legs, in which case they are vulnerable until they can obtain a set. Sligs can be possessed by the player character, who can then control the Slig and utilize its weapon. Sligs cannot see in dark shadows, which create natural hiding places for the player character. Sligs are often accompanied by Slogs, bipedal dog-like creatures that chase and attack the player character on sight. Slogs can be commanded if the player possesses a Slig, and can be ordered to attack and kill enemies. Sloggies are the puppy form of Slogs, and are slower but just as deadly if the player character encounters them. Slogs and Sloggies can be distracted with bones.

Other enemies include Greeters, robotic security guards originally designed for public speaking and advertising, until they began to attack their customers. Greeters have [[motion sensor|motion detectors]], and if the player character or another Mudokon triggers a Greeter's detector, the Greeter will give chase and attempt to kill the victim with an electric charge.

Glukkons feature as the game's primary antagonists. Glukkons are tall-foreheaded, humanoid creatures who are ruthless, malevolent businessmen. They walk on their arms as their feet are located upon their chest, and as a result they are physically defenseless and rely on Sligs to protect and serve them. They are the owners and bosses of the industries Abe visits throughout the game, and the masters of the Mudokon and Slig slaves. Glukkons can be possessed by the player, and can be made to command Sligs through GameSpeak, either to kill other characters, or to pull levers and move platforms.

Animals and wildlife consist of the [[Scrab]]s and aforementioned Paramites, both [[carnivore|carnivorous]] predators that are encountered in the burial vaults of Necrum. Scrabs are highly territorial and chase any other life form on sight. Should they encounter another Scrab, a short fight ensues in which one is killed. Paramites are [[pack hunter]]s, and when the player encounters a single Paramite, the Paramite will flee and not attack the player unless they are cornered. When encountered in groups of two or more, Paramites will pursue and attack the player. Paramites can be distracted with chunks of meat.

Other wildlife include the Fleeches, worm-like creatures that live in the Oddworld underworld. When woken from sleep, they will chase the player character and any other Mudokons, attacking with their long tongues before swallowing the victim whole. Fleeches fear Scrabs and Paramites and try to avoid them whenever possible. Fleeches are the only enemy that cannot kill Abe in one hit and it is possible to run away from Fleeches while they are attacking before they hit Abe enough to kill him, They are also the only enemies that can navigate up platform edges. Slurgs, the lowest form of life on Oddworld, are often found alongside Fleeches, as when stepped on by the player character, Slurgs emit a noise that wakes Fleeches from sleep. They can also be eaten by possessed Paramites without disturbing any nearby sleeping Fleeches

==Story==
[[Image:Oddworld Mudokons.jpg|thumb|Abe's friends retaliating against him, before they get sick.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"His scarred hand branded on moon's odd face, this hero may free the Mudokon race. With skin of blue and spirit guides too, only he can save our bones from brew. But shall he fall to Glukkon yoke, Mudokon nation... BE DOOMED TO CROAK."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The events of ''Abe's Exoddus'' follow on immediately from [[Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee#Story|the events of ''Abe's Oddysee'']], beginning with the protagonist standing in front of a cheering crowd having saved 99 of his brethren from RuptureFarms. Abe falls from the stage, and loses consciousness; whereupon three Mudokon spirits known as the Weirdos inform Abe that the Glukkons are using Mudokon slaves to [[exhumation|exhume]] Mudokon bones at Necrum, the burial grounds of the ancient Mudokons.&lt;ref name="Overview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee|url=http://www.oddworld.com/firsttenyears/games/ow_abeexo.shtml|work=Oddworld Inhabitants|accessdate=September 5, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216042559/http://www.oddworld.com/firsttenyears/games/ow_abeexo.shtml|archivedate=December 16, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abe and five friends (including an individual named Alf) cross the deserts of Oddworld, and infiltrate Necrum Mines, where Abe is separated from his friends.

Abe explores the mines and is reunited with his friends; but they drink an excess of an Industrial drink called Soulstorm Brew and become sick from doing so. Abe then discovers that Soulstorm Brew contains Mudokon bones. At this, Abe overloads the boilers that power Necrum Mines, only just escaping the resulting explosion. Thereafter Abe navigates the jungles and Mudokon [[burial vault (tomb)|burial vault]]s of Necrum, liberating trapped Mudokon spirits, until he finds the three Weirdos who told him about Necrum. They ask him to shut down Soulstorm Brewery, which is also exploiting Mudokon slaves, and brand a scar across his chest, which gives Abe the power to heal Mudokons sick from Brew. Having restored his friends, Abe proceeds to the FeeCo Depot, a large railway station and [[transshipment]]/storage area, where he learns that the entrance to Soulstorm Brewery has been sealed by three high-ranking Glukkons. To unseal the entrance, Abe infiltrates a bone processing plant named Bonewerkz, the Slig [[Barracks]], and the FeeCo Executive Office. By possessing all three Glukkon owners in turn, Abe orders the Slig guards to open the main gate of Soulstorm Brewery, and uses a train from the FeeCo Depot to get there. As Abe explores Soulstorm Brewery, he learns that the second ingredient of Soulstorm Brew is Mudokon tears, and that the Glukkons obtain the tears by attaching Mudokon slaves to machines that electrocute them repeatedly. Abe also discovers that he can destroy the brewery by overloading its main boiler and causing an explosion. What happens next depends on how many Mudokons Abe has saved throughout the game.

[[Image:SoulStorm Destruction.jpg|thumb|The destruction of Soulstorm Brewery.]]
*If 150 or more Mudokons are rescued, Abe succeeds in destroying Soulstorm Brewery, and escapes to be greeted by the Mudokons he saved, who then use their skills to build a [[Alcoholics Anonymous|rehabilitation center for Brew addicts]] named "Alf's Rehab &amp; Tea". Abe is called a "terrorist mastermind" by the Magog Cartel, and a hero by his fellow Mudokons who resolve to find and free other enslaved Mudokons (this ending is cut short by a "newscaster" Slig who reports in on the rumor of Abe's destruction of Soulstorm Brewery, reminding the viewers to "stay tuned for more on this story as it develops").&lt;ref&gt;''Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus'' "Good Ending" FMV movie.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Should the player save less than 150 Mudokons, they will instead receive the Bad Ending. Abe is ganged up on by his friends for not helping the slaves, and he is knocked unconscious. He is attached to a machine used by the brewery for extracting tears, and is killed by an overload of electricity from the machine.&lt;ref&gt;''Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus'' "Bad Ending" FMV movie.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the endings, if the player saves all 300 Mudokons, they are rewarded with a screen that says "Coming in 2000, ''Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee''". This screen is followed by another that gives supposed hints to the upcoming release including Abe's long lost mother. This information, however, is presumed to be a part of the original story that was cut since there is no mention of Abe's mother in ''[[Munch's Oddysee]]'' at all. Finally an art gallery showing concept and production art for ''Abe's Exoddus'' will begin playing.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

If the player kills every Mudokon, except those that cannot be reached or must be rescued to proceed through the game, they will be returned to the FeeCo Depot with permanent invincibility. This was prevented by a bug in the PC version of the game.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

==Development==
{{expand section|date=January 2009}}
Following the overwhelming success of ''Abe's Oddysee'', [[GT Interactive]], the publishers of ''Abe's Oddysee'' and ''Abe's Exoddus'', pushed for a sequel to be made by [[Christmas]] 1998. In order to meet this deadline, ''Abe's Exoddus'' was made to run on the same game engine as ''Abe's Oddysee'', and was completed in nine months. [[Lorne Lanning]], the [[game director|director]] of both games, stated that "we killed ourselves getting ''Abe's Exoddus'' done in nine months. It was brutal."&lt;ref name="GOGEditorial"/&gt;

The [[Game Boy Color]] port was released as '''''Oddworld Adventures 2'''''; it was developed by [[Saffire Corporation]] and published by [[GT Interactive]] in November [[1999 in video gaming|1999]]. The game is a significantly cut-down version of ''Abe's Exoddus'', with only a few similar levels and an absence of plot.&lt;ref name="boy1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason White|title=Oddworld Adventures 2|url=http://www.allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&amp;sql=1:20934|publisher=Allgame|accessdate=October 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Video game console emulator|emulated]] version of the PlayStation version was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] via [[PlayStation Network]] on October 22, 2009 in North America and on June 2, 2010 in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.PlayStation.com/2009/10/coming-to-psn-this-week-oddworld-psone-classics|title=Coming to PSN this Week: Oddworld PSone Classics|author=[[Lorne Lanning]]|publisher=PlayStation.blog|date=October 22, 2009|accessdate=October 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.eu.PlayStation.com/2010/06/02/heads-up-PlayStation-store-update-2nd-june-2010/|title=‘Heads-Up’ PlayStation Store Update (2 June 2010)|author=Mike Kebby|publisher=[[PlayStation Network]]|date=June 2, 2010|accessdate=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GameSpot's sole criticism was of the game's two-player mode, stating that "the waiting game just doesn't parallel the egocentric fun of keeping this title to yourself".&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; ''PC Zone'' focused on the game's difficulty, stating that "it's too f**king hard...You sometimes start to dread moving into a (obviously harder) new area of the game".&lt;ref name="PCZone review"/&gt; IGN criticised [[trial and error]] gameplay, stating that "the same trial-and-error scheme is frustrating as a thorn in your heel. Several areas simply leave you stranded, and you have to start over."&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt;

Despite these criticisms, the game won many awards, including the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] Showstopper award from GamePro in 1998, the E3 Best of Show Winners List, the Best Action/Adventure PSX Game award from Next Level Holiday Guide in 1999, and the 1998 Best PSX Adventure Game award from Game Revolution in 1999.&lt;ref name="AwardsList"/&gt; It was nominated for [[CNET|CNET Gamecenter]]'s 1999 "Best Arcade Game" award, which ultimately went to ''[[Rayman 2: The Great Escape]]''.&lt;ref name=gamecenter1999&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000606180348/http://gamecenter.com:80/Features/Exclusives/Awards99/ | url=http://gamecenter.com:80/Features/Exclusives/Awards99/ | title=The Gamecenter Awards for 1999! | author=The Gamecenter Staff | date=January 21, 2000 | archivedate=June 6, 2000 | work=[[CNET|CNET Gamecenter]] | deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the computer version of ''Abe's Exoddus'' sold 9,499 copies during 1999.&lt;ref name=pcgsales3&gt;{{cite journal|author=Staff|date=April 2000|volume=7|issue=4|title=''PC Gamer'' Editors' Choice Winners: Does Quality Matter?|journal=[[PC Gamer US]]|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to further market the game Developer Oddworld Inhabitants submitted a 15-minute short film of looped cinematics for the '[[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]]' category of the [[71st Academy Awards]]. The game's cinematics reportedly cost around $2 million to develop, about half of the game's total development budget.&lt;ref name="SPIN"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ayeEJMF-CZUC&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=david%20kushner&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20kushner&amp;f=false | title=Land of the Loops | author=Kushner, David | journal=SPIN | date=May  1999 | volume=15 | issue=5 | pages=73 | ISSN= 0886-3032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the film failed to meet the shortlist CEO of Oddworld Sherry McKenna stated the pioneering move was done in order to increase the video game industry's reputation in the animation field:

==Remake==
On March 14, 2016 it was announced via a press-release that a new game titled ''Oddworld: Soulstorm'' is in development in conjunction with [[Frima Studio]], Sabotage and Fat Kraken Studios and is slated to be released later in 2017,&lt;ref name="soulstormannouncement"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kamen |first1=Matt |title=Oddworld returns in 2017 with mysterious 'Soulstorm' |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/oddworld-soulstorm-gaming-classic-returns |date=March 14, 2016 |publisher=Wired |accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; later delayed to 2019. The game has been described by [[Oddworld Inhabitants]] as "a complete story retake [of ''Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus''] inspired by our original tale."&lt;ref name="First images"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.destructoid.com/first-oddworld-soulstorm-image-surfaces-415232.phtml |title=First Oddworld: Soulstorm image surfaces |last=Devore |first=Jordan |work=[[Destructoid]] |date=January 27, 2017 |accessdate=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the announcement, it was announced in April 2015 that a remake of ''Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus'' was in the planning stages. Lanning said that ''Exoddus''{{'}}s success would contribute significantly to future ''Oddworld'' titles, and would be marketed more broadly than ''[[Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2015/04/14/oddworld-abes-exoddus-remake-in-the-works/|title=Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus remake in the works|author=Brenna Hillier|work=[[VG247]]|date=April 14, 2015|accessdate=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the development of ''Oddworld: Soulstorm'', Oddworld Inhabitants have started an [[alternate reality game]] in which they encourage fans to look for clues within files and websites they upload.&lt;ref name="First images" /&gt;

In September 2016 at the [[EGX (expo)|EGX Expo]], Oddworld Inhabitants game designer Matt Glanville said that ''Oddworld: Soulstorm'' is going to be a bigger version of ''Abe's Exoddus''; featuring both areas and game mechanics from ''Exoddus'' as well as entirely new areas. The Quarma system from ''[[Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee]]'' will return and the path that the player takes will depend on the storyline. He also stated that ''Oddworld: Soulstorm'' is a sequel to ''Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty'' and will be what ''Abe's Exoddus'' should have been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=September 23, 2016 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2AcGZd8P5Q |title=The Past and Future of Oddworld |publisher=EGX via YouTube |accessdate=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, it was announced that ''Oddworld: Soulstorm'' will have its first showcase at a Unity event in Berlin. It also states that attendees will give a closer look at Lorne Lanning's Studio.&lt;ref name="soulstormpremire"&gt;{{cite web|title=World Premires for Oddworld: Soulstorm, GTFO and More to be Showcased at Unite Berlin|url=https://wccftech.com/premiere-oddworld-soulstorm-unite-berlin/|website=wccftech|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19th 2018, a video was released during a conference which [[Oddworld Inhabitants]] uploaded to their YouTube channel titled Oddworld Video Showcase at Unite Berlin 2018. In this video, it shows [[Lorne Lanning]] in his studio working on some graphics design for the game using a digital pen and he says that Soulstorm is "soon to be released".&lt;ref name="soulstormunite"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lanning |first1=Lorne |title=Oddworld Video Showcase Unite Berlin |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv9Zoyo8o8s |website=YouTube |accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then confirmed that Soulstorm will be released in 2019 - but platforms have not been announced.

[[Image:Smooth camber.jpg|400px|right|Parker Variable wing]]
The '''Parker variable wing''' is a wing configuration in [[biplane]] or [[triplane]] aircraft designed by [[H.F. Parker]] in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;H. F Parker "[http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/1920/naca-report-77.pdf The Parker Variable Camber Wing]", ''NACA Report 77'' (PDF), 1920. National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. Retrieved 7 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; His design allows a supplement in lift while landing or taking-off.
The system is depicted in the figure. The figure shows the biplane configuration. The lower [[airfoil]] is rigid. The upper airfoil is flexible. At high [[angle of attack]] the flow over the lower airfoil will cause the airflow to bend up and create an upward force at the lower surface of the upper airfoil. This upward force will cause the flexible section to be
pushed upward. The flexible wing section is held at points A and B. The [[trailing edge]] is rigid and can rotate about point B. Due to this effect the [[Camber (aerodynamics)|camber]] of the airfoil is increased, and hence the lift it creates is increased.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6959">'''Planetary nebula luminosity function''' ('''PNLF''') is a secondary&lt;ref name="Ferrareseetal2000" /&gt; [[standard candle|distance indicator]] used in [[astronomy]].   It makes use of the [[O III|[O&amp;nbsp;III]]] λ5007 [[forbidden line]] found in all [[planetary nebula]] (PNe) which are members of the old stellar populations ([[Population II]]).&lt;ref name="Ferrareseetal2000"&gt;{{harvnb|Ferrarese|Ford|Huchra|Kennicutt|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It can be used to determine distances to both [[spiral galaxy|spiral]] and [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical]] galaxies despite their completely different [[stellar populations]] and is part of the [[Extragalactic Distance Scale]].&lt;ref name="=Schoenberneretal2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Schoenberner|Jacob|Steffen|Sandin|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==
The distance estimate to a galaxy using the PNLF requires discovery of such an object in the target galaxy that is visible at λ5007 but not when the entire spectrum is considered.  These points are candidate PNe, however, there are three other types of objects that would also exhibit such an emission line that must be filtered out: [[HII region|HII&amp;nbsp;regions]], [[supernova remnant]]s, and [[Lyα galaxy|Lyα galaxies]]. After the PNe are determined, to estimate a distance one must measure their monochromatic &lt;nowiki&gt;[O&amp;nbsp;III]&lt;/nowiki&gt; λ5007 lumonisity.  What remains is a statistical sample of
PNe.  The observed luminosity function is then fitted to some standard law.&lt;ref name="Ciardullo2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Ciardullo|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, one must estimate the foreground [[interstellar extinction]].  The two sources of extinction, are from within the [[Milky Way]] and the internal extinction of the target galaxy.  The first is well known and can be taken from sources such as reddening maps computed from [[H I region|H&amp;nbsp;I]] measurements and galaxy counts or from [[IRAS]] and [[Diffuse InfraRed Background Experiment|DIRBE]] satellite experiments.  The later type of extinction, occurs only in target galaxies which are either late type [[spiral galaxy|spiral]] or [[irregular galaxy|irregular]].  However, this extinction is difficult to measure.  In the Milky Way, the scale height of PNe is much bigger than that of the dust.  Observational data and models support that this holds true for other galaxies, that the bright edge of the PNLF is primarily due to PNe in front of the dust layer.  The data and models support a less than 0.05 [[apparent magnitude]] internal extinction of a galaxy's PNe.&lt;ref name="Ciardullo2004" /&gt;

== Physics behind process ==
The PNLF method is unbiased by [[metallicity]]. This is because [[oxygen]] is a primary nebular coolant; any drop in its concentration raises the plasma’s electron temperature and raises the amount of [[collisional excitation]]s per ion.  This compensates for having a smaller number of emitting ions in the PNe resulting in little change in the λ5007 emissions .  Consequently, a reduction in oxygen density only lowers the emergent &lt;nowiki&gt;[O&amp;nbsp;III]&lt;/nowiki&gt; λ5007 emission line intensity by approximately the square root of the difference in abundance. At the same time, the PNe’s core responds to metallicity the opposite way. In the case where the metallicity of the progenitor star is smaller, the PNe’s [[central star]] will be a bit more massive and its illuminating ultraviolet flux will be a bit greater. This added energy almost precisely accounts for the decreased emissions of the PNe.  Consequently, the total &lt;nowiki&gt;[O&amp;nbsp;III]&lt;/nowiki&gt; λ5007 lumonisity that is produced by a PNe is practically
uncorrelated to metallicity. This beneficial negation is in agreement with more precise models of PNe evolution.  Only in extremely metal-poor PNe does the brightness of the PNLF cutoff dim by more than a small percentage.&lt;ref name="Ciardullo2004" /&gt;

The relative independence of the PNLF cutoff with respect to population age is harder to understand.  The [O&amp;nbsp;III] λ5007 flux of a PNe directly correlates to the brightness of its central star.  Further, the brightness of its central star directly correlates to its mass and the central star's mass directly varies in relation to its progenitor's mass.  However, by observation, it is demonstrated that reduced brightness does not happen.&lt;ref name="Ciardullo2004" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Pratt Institute - Report of students enrolled for Library Department for 1890.jpg|thumb|right|A listing of the students from 1890 enrolled in the morning and afternoon cataloging classes, as well as a list of students enrolled in the Library training class.]]
[[Charles Pratt]], founder of [[Pratt Institute]], recognized the need for a library that served both the faculty and students of the Institute as well as [[Brooklyn]] residents. He also recognized the need to have a facility for training of library staff. In June 1890, Pratt Institute offered courses in cataloging and library economics.&lt;ref name="richardson"&gt;Richardson Jr., John V.

''The Origins of the American Library School.'' New York: Scarecrow Press, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mary Wright Plummer]], who was a graduate of [[Melvil Dewey]]’s class of 1888 from [[Columbia University]], led it.&lt;ref name="sharify" /&gt; In 1896, the Library School relocated to Pratt's new library building designed by [[William Tubby]], which continues to act as Pratt Institute’s primary library.&lt;ref name="sharify" /&gt;

Under Plummer's leadership, the school enacted a stiff entrance exam and exams in German and French.&lt;ref name="brand"&gt;Brand, Barbara B.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=fcT2xjeOEQoC&amp;lpg=PA253&amp;ots=tuZGPdabTR&amp;dq=margaret%20healy%20pratt&amp;pg=PA251#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Pratt Institute Library School: The Perils of Professionalization."]  In Suzanne Hildenbrand (Ed.), ''Reclaiming the American Library Past: Writing the Women In'', pp. 251-278.  Norwood, NJ: Ablex Publishing, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  The entering class was consistently around 25 students.&lt;ref name="brand" /&gt; In 1911 when Plummer left to direct the Training School at New York Public Library, [[Josephine Adams Rathbone]] was appointed vice-director. Both Plummer and Rathbone were elected as presidents of the [[American Library Association]].

Notable alumni from this early period include [[Anne Carroll Moore]], who was a student of [[Mary Wright Plummer]], and became a faculty member and the first children’s librarian at [[New York Public Library]], serving in that position for 35 years (1906–1941).&lt;ref name="sharify" /&gt;&lt;ref name=miller&gt;

''Encyclopædia Britannica. '' http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/647365/Mary-Elizabeth-Wood&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, Pratt began to grant the degree of [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor of science]] in library science and, in 1950, the master of library science degree.&lt;ref name="sharify" /&gt; Notable figures from the twentieth century include [[Nasser Sharify]], who worked to develop the field of international librarianship as dean and professor from 1968 to 1987.&lt;ref name="sharify_papers"&gt;[http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf309n99dt/entire_text/ Scope and content of collection], Nasser Sharify papers, Hoover Institution Archives. Accessed March 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after Nasser Sharify stepped into the role of Dean in 1968, the school’s name changed to the Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS).  This would reflect the advances in technology and information science and Pratt’s embrace of these changes.  “This action went far beyond a mere change in nomenclature,” Dean Sharify wrote in his 1978 history of the school. “Rather, the new designation gave recognition to an emerging and important new discipline [Information Science].”&lt;ref name="sharify" /&gt;

In the aftermath of Pratt’s name change, the school rewrote its goals and objectives and began to expand its technology holdings.  In need of more space for computer labs, GSLIS moved from the library on the Brooklyn campus to its own building, the Information Science Center (ISC), in 1974.  It included laboratories built for more hands-on technical computer study, including an instructional materials lab, an information science lab, and a technical processes lab.

[[File:A class in the Pratt Institute Library School, 1897.jpg|thumb|A class in the Pratt Institute Library School, 1897.]]The school celebrated its centennial in 1990. In the [[United States House of Representatives]], New York Congressman [[Major Owens]] (first librarian to serve in Congress) gave a salute to Pratt Institute's library school "both for its 100th anniversary, and for being the oldest such library program in the country."&lt;ref&gt;101st Congress, 2nd Session, [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r101:E16OC0-431:/ A Salute to Pratt Institute's Library Science Department on Its 100th Anniversary].

Pratt Institute School of Information relocated to the Pratt Manhattan Center at 144 West 14th Street in [[Manhattan]] in Fall 2002, and it continues to operate from that location.&lt;ref name="lj"&gt;"[http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2002/09/ljarchives/pratt-sils-now-anchored-in-manhattan/ Pratt SILS Now Anchored in Manhattan]."

'''Psychological theories of magic''' treat magic as a personal phenomenon intended to meet individual needs, as opposed to a social phenomenon serving a collective purpose.  

==Theories==
===Psychosis===

Among the earliest psychological theories is the psychosis theory, advanced by [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S.  Totem and taboo: Resemblances between the psychic lives of savages and neurotics.  London: Routledge Kegan Paul (1960).  (Original work published 1913).&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, “primitive man” is not a rational being, and in fact [[magical thinking]] bears a strong resemblance to neuroses. However, this conclusion has come into question, as more recent psychological theory acknowledges that psychological testing does not cross cultures with complete accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Gleitman, H., Reisberg, D., &amp; Gross, J.  Psychology, 7th edition.  New York, NY: W. W. Norton &amp; Co (2007). &lt;/ref&gt; 

===Bad science===
In contrast, the “bad science” model claims that primitive man is rational, and magical beliefs come into existence as he tries to explain puzzling phenomena without enough information.  According to this theory, the magician is an early form of scientist who merely lacks adequate data.  In [[Edward Burnett Tylor]]’s version of this theory, the magician’s folly is in mistaking an ideal connection for a real one; the magician believes that thematically-linked items can influence one another by virtue of their similarity.&lt;ref&gt;Evans-Pritchard, E.E.  Theories of Primitive Religion.  Oxford: Oxford University Press (1977), p.p. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Azande]] rub crocodile teeth on banana plants to make them fruitful (because crocodile teeth grow continuously).  The property of [[fertility]] can spread from a symbol of fertility (the crocodile tooth) to the intended target (the banana tree).  Michael F. Brown observes that many Aguaruna taboos can be understood as preventing undesired connections. 

===Symbolic action===
The symbolic action theory understands magic as a course of action taken when there exists an emotional (psychological) need for action, but no practical option exists. In [[R.R. Marett]]’s example, it is a magical action when a man, betrayed by his mistress, gathers photographs of her and burns them.&lt;ref&gt;R.R. Marett.  The Threshold of Religion, 2nd edition.  (1914).  Summary courtesy of Evans-Pritchard, Theories of Primitive Religion, p.p. 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation presents a modern analog of the [[voodoo doll]].  As Marett describes, if the emotional situation proves common enough, the response becomes a socially-codified norm which outsiders understand as magic and which Marett labels “developed magic”.  Claude Lévi-Strauss&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude. ''The Effectiveness of Symbols.''&lt;/ref&gt; and Ariel Glucklich&lt;ref&gt;Glucklich, Ariel. ''The End of Magic.'' New York: Oxford University Press (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; expand upon symbolic theory, positing that magic can serve as a form of psychotherapy or [[New Age]] science,  accomplishing real results by what amounts to the [[placebo effect]]. The effects of such magic would be made real through its effect on the individual person as demonstrated in their life and actions.

===Anxiety relief===
According to theories of anxiety relief and control, people turn to magical beliefs when there exists a sense of uncertainty and potential danger and little to do about it.  Magic is used to restore a sense of control.  In support of this theory, research indicates that superstitious behavior is invoked more often in high stress situations, especially by people with a greater desire for control.&lt;ref&gt;Keinan, Giora.  ''The effects of stress and desire for control on superstitious behavior.'' Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin Vol. 28, No. 1.  Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc. (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed that one reason (but not necessarily the only reason) for the persistence of magic rituals is that the ritual activates vigilance-precaution systems – that is to say, that the rituals prompt their own use by creating a feeling of insecurity and then proposing themselves as precautions.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Pascal and Pierre Liénard.  ''Ritual behavior in obsessive and normal individuals.''  Association for Psychological Science (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pascal Boyer]] and Pierre Liénard propose that the shape rituals take results from goal demotion and attentional focus on lower level representation.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Pascal and Pierre Liénard.  ''Ritual behavior in obsessive and normal individuals.''  Association for Psychological Science (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Levels of representation were previously described by J.M. Zacks and [[Barbara Tversky]].&lt;ref&gt;Zacks, J.M. and B. Tversky.  ''Event structure in perception and conception.''  Psychological Bulletin, 127, 3-21.  (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; At the lowest level are simple gestures (such as putting the left foot in a shoe).  At the mid-level are behavioral episodes (such as putting one’s shoes on). At the highest level are scripts (such as getting dressed to go out). Ordinarily, people describe and recall behavior in terms of the middle level of behavioral episodes{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}.  In studies of [[obsessive-compulsive]] rituals, focus shifts to the lower level of gestures, resulting in goal demotion. For example, an obsessive-compulsive cleaning ritual may overemphasize the order, direction, and number of wipes used to clean the surface.  The goal becomes less important than the actions used to achieve the goal, with the implication that magic rituals can persist without efficacy because the intent is lost within the act. Debate remains as to whether studies of obsessive-compulsive rituals can be extended to describe other kinds of rituals.

A '''retention basin,''' sometimes called a '''wet pond,''' '''wet [[detention basin]]''' or '''stormwater management pond,''' is an artificial lake with vegetation around the perimeter, and includes a permanent pool of water in its design&lt;ref&gt;[http://wef.org Water Environment Federation], Alexandria, VA; and [http://www.asce.org American Society of Civil Engineers], Reston, VA. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AdU-VXXV_H0C "Urban Runoff Quality Management."] WEF Manual of Practice No.  23; ASCE Manual and Report on Engineering Practice No.  87. 1998. {{ISBN|1-57278-039-8}}. Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, D.C. [https://www.epa.gov/eg/industrial-wastewater-studies-miscellaneous "Preliminary Data Summary of Urban Storm Water Best Management Practices."] Chapter 5. August 1999. Document No. EPA-821-R-99-012.&lt;/ref&gt;'''&lt;ref&gt;University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. "If you build it they will come: Frogs flourish in humanmade ponds." ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 27 August 2015. &lt;www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/08/150827154644.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;'''. It is used to manage [[stormwater]] [[surface runoff|runoff]] to prevent [[flood]]ing and downstream [[erosion]], and improve [[water quality]] in an adjacent [[river]], [[stream]], [[lake]] or [[bay]].  

It is distinguished from a [[detention basin]], sometimes called a "dry pond", which temporarily stores water after a storm, but eventually empties out at a controlled rate to a downstream water body.  It also differs from an [[infiltration basin]] which is designed to direct stormwater to [[groundwater]] through permeable soils.

Wet ponds are frequently used for water quality improvement, [[groundwater recharge]], flood protection, aesthetic improvement or any combination of these.  Sometimes they act as a replacement for the natural absorption of a forest or other natural process that was lost when an area is developed.  As such, these structures are designed to blend into neighborhoods and viewed as an amenity.&lt;ref&gt;Mississippi State University. College of Engineering. [http://www.abe.msstate.edu/csd/p-dm/all-chapters/chapter4/chapter4/srb1.pdf Stormwater Retention Basins. Chapter 4, Best Management Practices.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In urban areas, [[impervious surface]]s (roofs, roads) reduce the time spent by rainfall before entering into the stormwater drainage system.  If left unchecked, this will cause widespread flooding downstream.  The function of a stormwater pond is to contain this surge and release it slowly.  This slow release mitigates the size and intensity of storm-induced flooding on downstream receiving waters. Stormwater ponds also collect suspended sediments, which are often found in high concentrations in stormwater water due to upstream construction and sand applications to roadways.

==Design features==
Storm water is typically channeled to a retention basin through a system of street and/or [[parking lot]] [[storm drain]]s, and a network of drain channels or underground pipes. The basins are designed to allow relatively large flows of water to enter, but discharges to receiving waters are limited by outlet structures that function only during very large storm events.

Retention ponds are often landscaped with a variety of [[grass]]es, [[shrub]]s and/or [[wetland]] plants to provide bank stability and aesthetic benefits.  Vegetation also provides water quality benefits by removing soluble nutrients through uptake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.udfcd.org Urban Drainage &amp; Flood Control District], Denver, CO.  [http://www.udfcd.org/downloads/pdf/critmanual/Volume%203%20PDFs/04%20Structural%20BMP%202008-04%20rev.pdf Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual. Volume 3, Structural BMPs.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731053100/http://www.udfcd.org/downloads/pdf/critmanual/Volume%203%20PDFs/04%20Structural%20BMP%202008-04%20rev.pdf |date=2009-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some areas the ponds can attract nuisance types of wildlife like ducks or [[Canada goose|Canada geese]], particularly where there is minimal landscaping and grasses are mowed.  This reduces the ability of [[fox]]es, [[coyote]]s and other [[predator]]s to approach their prey unseen. Such predators tend to hide in the cattails and other tall, thick grass surrounding natural water features.

Depth of retention ponds is of critical importance, for removal of pollutants and the volume of fish that could be inhabiting the pond.  [[Urban fishing]] continues to be one of the fastest growing fishing segments as new suburban neighbourhoods are built around these aquatic areas

==Other meanings==
A retention basin can also be a part of a [[nuclear reactor]] used to contain a core meltdown.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14440">{{for|the telephony or computing term|quality of service}}'''Service quality (SQ)''', in its contemporary conceptualisation, is a comparison of perceived expectations (E) of a [[service (business)|service]] with perceived performance (P), giving rise to the equation SQ=P-E.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis and Booms (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; This conceptualistion of service quality has its origins in the expectancy-disconfirmation paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, R.L., Balakrishnan, P.V. S. and Barry, B., "Outcome Satisfaction in Negotiation: A Test of Expectancy Disconfirmation," ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,'' Vol. 60, no. 2, 1994, Pages 252-275&lt;/ref&gt;

A business with high service quality will meet or exceed [[customer]] expectations whilst remaining economically [[competitivity|competitive]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://asq.org/services/why-quality/overview.html  ASQ The Global voice of Quality]&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence from empirical studies suggests that improved service quality increases profitability and long term economic competitiveness. Improvements to service quality may be achieved by improving operational processes; identifying problems quickly and systematically; establishing valid and reliable service [[performance measure]]s and measuring [[customer satisfaction]] and other performance outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asq.org/services/why-quality/overview.html  ASQ The Global voice of Quality]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

From the viewpoint of [[Administration (business)|business administration]], service quality is an achievement in [[customer service]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kenzelmann. ''Kundenbindung'' German, 3. Auflage, Berlin: Cornelsen Verlag Skriptor GmbH &amp; Co KG 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  It reflects at each service encounter. Customers form service expectations from past experiences, word of mouth and marketing communications.&lt;ref&gt;Parasuraman, A.; Berry, Leonard L.; Zeithaml, Valarie A., "Understanding Customer Expectations of Service," ''Sloan Management Review,'' Vol. 32, no. 3, 1991, pp 39 - 48&lt;/ref&gt; In general, customers compare perceived service with expected service, and  which if the former falls short of the latter the customers are disappointed.

For example, in the case of [[Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces]], wherein TAJ remaining the old world, luxury brand in the five-star category, the umbrella branding was diluting the image of the TAJ brand because although the different hotels such as ''Vivanta by Taj''- the four star category, ''Gateway'' in the three star category and ''Ginger'' the two star economy brand, were positioned and categorised differently, customers still expected high quality of Taj.

The measurement of subjective aspects of customer service depends on the conformity of the expected benefit with the perceived result. This in turns depends upon the customer's expectation in terms of service, they might receive and the service provider's ability and talent to  present this expected service. Successful companies add benefits to their offering that not only satisfy the customers but also surprise and [[customer delight|delight]] them. Delighting customers is a matter of exceeding their expectations. 
 
Pre-defined objective criteria may be unattainable in practice, in which case, the best possible achievable result becomes the ideal. The objective ideal may still be poor, in subjective terms.

Service quality can be related to service potential (for example, worker's qualifications); service process (for example, the quickness of service) and  service result (customer satisfaction).

'''Individual service quality''' states the service quality of employees as distinct from the quality that the customers perceived&lt;ref&gt;UYSAL, H.Tezcan &amp; Mehmet Selami YILDIZ (2013), “Effect of Organizational Levels on Individual Service Quality in Health Service: A Research on Doctors”. İktisat İşletme ve Finans Dergisi. 28(329), pp.21-48.&lt;/ref&gt;


==Evolution of service quality concept==

Historically, scholars have treated service quality as very difficult to define and measure, due to the inherent intangible nature of services, which are often experienced subjectively.&lt;ref&gt;Grönroos, C.,  "Scandinavian Management and the Nordic School of Services‐Contributions to Service Management and Quality", ''International Journal of Service Industry Management'', Vol. 2, No. 3, pp.17-26, DOI:10.1108/09564239110007247&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest attempts to grapple with the service quality concept came from the so-called ''Nordic School''. In this approach, service quality was seen as having two basic dimensions:&lt;ref&gt;Grönroos, C., "A Service Quality Model and its Marketing Implications," ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 18, No. 4, 1984, pp 36–44, DOI:10.1108/EUM0000000004784&lt;/ref&gt;

: '''''Technical quality:''''' ''What'' the customer receives as a result of interactions with the service firm (e.g. a meal in a restaurant, a bed in a hotel)
: '''''Functional quality''''': ''How'' the customer receives the service; the expressive nature of the service delivery (e.g. courtesy, attentiveness, promptness)

The technical quality is relatively objective and therefore easy to measure. However, difficulties arise when trying to evaluate functional quality.&lt;ref&gt;Grönroos, C., "A Service Quality Model and its Marketing Implications," ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 18, No. 4, 1984, p. 39, DOI:10.1108/EUM0000000004784&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dimensions of service quality==
[[File:Measuring service quality using SERVQUAL model (Kumar et al, 2009).png|thumb|The five dimensions of service quality]]
A customer's expectation of a particular service is determined by factors such as recommendations, personal needs and past experiences. The expected service and the perceived service sometimes may not be equal, thus leaving a gap. The service quality model or the ‘GAP model’ developed in 1985, highlights the main requirements for delivering high service quality. It identifies five ‘gaps’ that cause unsuccessful delivery. Customers generally have a tendency to compare the service they 'experience' with the service they 'expect'. If the experience does not match the expectation, there arises a gap.&lt;ref&gt;Parasuraman, A., Berry, L.L.,  Zeithaml, V. A., "Understanding Customer Expectations of Service," ''Sloan Management Review,'' Vol. 32, no. 3, 1991, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Given the emphasis on expectations, this approach to measuring service quality is known as the ''expectancy-disconfirmation paradigm'' and is the dominant model in the consumer behaviour and marketing literature. &lt;ref&gt;Zwick, R., Pieters, R. and Baumgartner, H., "On the Practical Significance of Hindsight Bias: The Case of the Expectancy-disconfirmation Model of Consumer Satisfaction", ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes'', Vol. 64, no. 1, pp 103-117, DOI: 10.1006/obhd.1995.1&lt;/ref&gt;

A model of service quality, based on the expectancy-disconformation paradigm, and developed by [[A. Parasuraman]], [[Valarie Zeithaml|Valarie A. Zeithaml]] and [[Leonard Berry (professor)|Len Berry]], identifies the principal dimensions (or components) of service quality and proposes a scale for measuring service quality, known as [[SERVQUAL]]. The model's developers originally identified [[SERVQUAL#Determinants|ten dimensions of service quality]] that influence customer's perceptions of service quality.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Parasuraman|Parasuraman]], [[Valarie Zeithaml]] and Berry (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; However, after extensive testing and retesting, some of the dimensions were found to be autocorrelated and the total number of dimensions was reduced to five, namely - reliability, assurance, tangibles, empathy and responsiveness. These five dimensions are thought to represent the dimensions of service quality across a range of industries and settings. &lt;ref&gt;Zeithaml, V.A., Berry, L.L. and Parasuraman, A., "Communication and Control Processes in the Delivery of Service Quality," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 52, No. 2, 1988, pp. 35-48 &lt;/ref&gt; Among students of marketing, the mnemonic,  '''RATER''', an acronym formed from the first letter of each of the five dimensions, is often used as an aid to recall.

In spite of the dominance of the expectancy-disconfirmation paradigm, scholars have questioned its validity. In particular scholars have pointed out the expetancy-disconfirmation approach had its roots in consumer research and was fundamentally concerned with measuring customer satisfaction rather than service quality. In other words, questions surround the ''face validity'' of the model and whether service quality can be conceptualised as a ''gap''.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, R.L., ''Satisfaction: A Behavioural Perspective on the Consumer,'' Boston, MA, Irwin McGraw-Hill, 1996; Souca, Ma. L., "SERVQUAL - Thirty years of research on service quality with implications for customer satisfaction," in ''Marketing - from Information to Decision,'' [Proceedings of the International Conference], Cluj-Napoca: Babes Bolyai University, 2011, pp 420 -429; van Dyke, T.P.,   Kappelman, L.A. and Prybutok, V.R.,"Measuring Information Systems Service Quality: Concerns on the Use of the SERVQUAL Questionnaire," ''MIS Quarterly,'' Vol. 21, No. 2, 1997, pp. 195-208, &lt;Online:  https://www.jstor.org/stable/249419&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring service quality==

Measuring service quality may involve both subjective and objective processes. In both cases, it is often some aspect of [[customer satisfaction]] which is being assessed. However, customer satisfaction is an [[indirect measure]] of service quality.

==E-service quality: The next frontier==

Given the widespread use of internet and [[e-commerce]], researchers have also sought to define and measure [[e-service]] quality. Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Malhotra (2005, p.&amp;nbsp;5) define e-service quality as the “extent to which a website facilitates efficient and effective shopping, purchasing, and delivery.” Wolfinbarger and Gilly (2003, p.&amp;nbsp;183) define e-service quality as “the beginning to the end of the transaction including information search, website navigation, order, customer service interactions, delivery, and satisfaction with the ordered product.”.&lt;ref&gt;Parasuraman, A., Valarie A. Zeithaml, and Arvind Malhotra (2005), “E-S-QUAL A Multiple-Item Scale for Assessing Electronic Service Quality,” Journal of Service Research, 7 (3), 213-33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfinbarger, Mary, and Mary C. Gilly (2003), “eTailQ: Dimensionalizing, Measuring and Predicting Etail Quality,” Journal of Retailing 79 (3), 183-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent paper examined research on e-service quality.&lt;ref&gt;Jukka Ojasalo. E-Service Quality: A Conceptual Model. ''International Journal of Arts and Sciences, 3''(7): 127 - 143 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The author identified four dimensions of e-service quality: website design, fulfillment, customer service, and security and privacy.

===Measuring subjective elements of service quality===

Subjective processes can be assessed in characteristics (assessed be the [[SERVQUAL]] method); in incidents (assessed in [[Critical Incident Technique|Critical Incident Theory]]) and in problems (assessed by ''Frequenz Relevanz Analyse'' a German term. The most important and most used method with which to measure subjective elements of service quality is the Servqual method.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Measuring objective elements of service quality===

Objective processes may be subdivided into primary processes and secondary processes. During primary processes, silent customers create test episodes of service or the service episodes of normal customers are observed. In secondary processes, quantifiable factors such as numbers of customer complaints or numbers of returned goods are analysed in order to make inferences about service quality.

==Approaches to the improvement of service quality==

In general, an improvement in service design and delivery helps achieve higher levels of service quality. For example, in service design, changes can be brought about in the design of service products and facilities. On the other hand, in service delivery, changes can be brought about in the service delivery processes, the environment in which the service delivery takes place and improvements in the interaction processes between customers and service providers.

Various techniques can be used to make changes such as: [[Quality function deployment]] (QFD); [[fail-safe|failsafing]]; moving the line of visibility and the line of accessibility; and [[Service blueprint|blueprinting]].

==Approaches to improve the conformity of service quality==

In order to ensure and increase the 'conformance quality' of services, that is,  service delivery happening as designed, various methods are available. Some of these include [[Surety|Guaranteeing]]; [[Mystery Shopping]]; Recovering; Setting standards and measuring; [[Statistical process control]] and [[Customer involvement management|Customer involvement]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean Harvey, "Service quality: a tutorial", Journal of Operations Management, 1998, No. 16, pp.583–597&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service quality and customer satisfaction ==
The relationship between service quality and customer satisfaction has received considerable attention in academic literature. The results of most research studies have indicated that the service quality and customer satisfaction are indeed independent but are closely related that and a rise in one is likely to result in an increase in another construct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The relationship between service quality and customer satisfaction – a factor specific approachnull|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/08876040210433248|journal = Journal of Services Marketing|date = 2002-07-01|issn = 0887-6045|pages = 363–379|volume = 16|issue = 4|doi = 10.1108/08876040210433248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Measuring Service Quality in Ethiopian Airlines|last = Shanka|first = Mesay Sata|date = 2012|journal = Journal of Educational and Social Research|doi = 10.5901/jesr.2012.v2n9p173|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 2 |issue = 9|pages = 173–180|issn = 2239-978X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN)''' is a standard [[graphical representation]] intended to foster the efficient storage, exchange and reuse of information about signaling pathways, metabolic networks, and [[gene regulatory network]]s amongst communities of biochemists, biologists, and theoreticians. The system was created over several years by a community of [[biochemist]]s, [[Modelling biological systems|modelers]] and [[computer scientist]]s.&lt;ref name="Lenov2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Le Novère N, Hucka M, Mi H, Moodie S, Schreiber F, Sorokin A, etal | title=The Systems Biology Graphical Notation. | journal=Nat Biotechnol | year= 2009 | volume= 27 | issue= 8 | pages= 735–41 | pmid=19668183 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=19668183 | doi=10.1038/nbt.1558 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SBGN is made up of three orthogonal languages for representing different views of biological systems: ''Process Descriptions'', ''Entity Relationships'' and ''Activity Flows''. Each language defines a comprehensive set of symbols with precise semantics, together with detailed syntactic rules regarding the construction and interpretation of maps.  Using these three notations, a life scientist can represent in an unambiguous way networks of interactions (for example [[biochemical]] interactions). These notations make use of an idea and symbols similar to that used by electrical and other engineers and known as the [[block diagram]]. The simplicity of SBGN syntax and semantics makes SBGN maps suitable for use at the high school level.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Some software support for SBGN is already available, mostly for the Process Description language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sbgn.org/Community#SBGN_Software |title=Community#SBGN_Software |publisher=sbgn.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67PufAQwM?url=http://www.sbgn.org/Community#SBGN_Software |archivedate=2012-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SBGN Process Description language ==

[[File:Example-SBGN-PD.png|thumb|right|example of SBGN Process Description map]] The SBGN Process Description (PD) language shows the temporal courses of biochemical interactions in a network. It can be used to show all the [[interactome|molecular interactions]] taking place in a network of biochemical entities, with the same entity appearing multiple times in the same diagram.&lt;ref name="Moodie2011"&gt;Moodie SL, Le Novère N, Demir E, Mi H &amp; Villéger A.

[http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3721/version/4 Nature Precedings (2011) ] {{doi|10.1038/npre.2011.3721.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SBGN Entity Relationship language ==

[[File:Example-SBGN-ER.png|thumb|right|example of SBGN Entity Relationship map]] The SBGN Entity Relationship (ER) language allows to see all the relationships in which a given entity participates, regardless of the temporal aspects. Relationships can be seen as rules describing the influences of entities nodes on other relationships.&lt;ref name="LeNovere2011"&gt;Le Novère N, Demir E, Mi H, Moodie S &amp; Villéger A.

== SBGN Activity Flow language ==

[[File:Example-SBGN-AF.png|thumb|right|example of SBGN Activity Flow map]] The SBGN Activity Flow (AF) language depicts the flow of information between biochemical entities in a network. It omits information about the state transitions of entities and is particularly convenient for representing the effects of perturbations, whether genetic or environmental in nature.&lt;ref name="Mi2009"&gt;Mi H, Schreiber F, Le Novère N, Moodie S, Sorokin A.

==History==

Work on defining a set of symbols to describe interactions and relationships of molecules was pioneered by Kurt Kohn at the [[National Cancer Institute]] with his [[Molecular Interaction Maps]] (MIM).&lt;ref name="Kohn2006"&gt;Kohn KW, Aladjem MI, Weinstein JN, Pommier Y. Molecular interaction maps of bioregulatory networks: a general rubric for systems biology.

The [http://sbgn.org/Events/SBGN-1 meeting that initiated] development of the Systems Biology Graphical Notation took place on February 11–12, 2006, at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), in Tokyo, Japan.

== Research ==

Ulrike Felt has published widely in different areas of Science, Technology, and Society. Throughout her work, questions of the public engagement with science and of science policy have been a major concern for Felt. Her work on public perception of different technologies, the organisation and reflection of different participatory events as well as on the complex relations of science and democracy has contributed in many innovative ways to the debates in STS and beyond.

An important line of her work has focused on changing modes of knowledge production within the sciences, and on how this impacts ways of working and living within research cultures. She has introduced the concept of  “epistemic living spaces” &lt;ref&gt;Felt, Ulrike (ed.) (2009): Knowing and Living in Academic Research. Convergence and Heterogeneity in Research Cultures in the European Context (Prague: Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic).&lt;/ref&gt; in order to describe how the social and epistemic are co-produced within scientific work spaces:

''"By epistemic living space, we mean researchers’ individual or collective perceptions and narrative re-constructions of the structures, contexts, rationales, actors and values which mould, guide and delimit their potential actions, both in what they aim to know as well as in how they act in social contexts in science and beyond."'' (Felt/Fochler 2010: 4f)&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencestudies.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/dep_sciencestudies/pdf_files/Preprints/Felt_Fochler_Re-Ordering_Epistemic_V3_071011.pdf Felt, Ulrike and Fochler, Maximilian (2012) 'Re-ordering Epistemic Living Spaces: On the Tacit Governance Effects of the Public Communication of Science', in Rödder, S., Franzen, M. and P. Weingart (eds), The Sciences' Media Connection – Communication to the Public and its Repercussions. Sociology of the Sciences Yearbook 28 (Dortrecht: Springer): 133-154.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Using this concept, she has pointed to the potential implications of recent changes within career structures and the organization of the sciences for the knowledge produced within contemporary societies, focusing recently on changing temporal orders of research practices and policy.

Another line of her work has focused on how science and technology are embedded within local and national contexts. By introducing the notion of “technopolitical cultures” (Felt et al. 2010),&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencestudies.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/dep_sciencestudies/pdf_files/Preprints/Felt_Fochler_winkler_coming_to_terms_preprint_Aug2010.pdf Felt, Ulrike, Fochler, Maximilian and Winkler, Peter (2010) 'Coming to Terms with Biomedical Technologies in Different Technopolitical Cultures. A Comparative Analysis of Focus Groups on Organ Transplantation and Genetic Testing in Austria, France, and the Netherlands', Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values 35/4: 525-553.]&lt;/ref&gt; Felt has pointed to the nationally distinct ways of how technoscience is entangled with cultural norms and values. Further, she is interested in how novel technologies like nano or genetic testing become imagined and integrated within specific local contexts. These questions are closely tied to her methodological interests. Felt and the Department of Social Studies of Science have engaged not only in the development of novel qualitative social science methods, but also in reflecting the performativity and politics of both participatory engagements and traditional socio-scientific methods.

More recently, and lying across her different research interests, she has been engaging with the role of changing temporal structures and the growing importance of future in shaping the interface of science, technology and society.

Finally, since late 2015 she is leading a new interfaculty research platform at the University of Vienna "Responsible Research and Innovation in Academic Practice".&lt;ref&gt;[http://rri.univie.ac.at/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Video design''' or '''projection design''' is a creative field of stagecraft. It is concerned with the creation and integration of film, motion graphics and live camera feed into the fields of [[theatre]], [[opera]], [[dance]], [[fashion shows]], [[concerts]] and other live events. Video design has only recently gained recognition as a separate creative field. Prior to this, the responsibilities of video design would often be taken on by a [[scenic designer]] or [[lighting designer]]. A person who practices the art of video design is often known as a '''Video Designer'''. However, naming conventions vary around the world, and so practitioners may also be credited as '''Projection Designer''', "Media Designer", '''[[Cinematographer]]''' or '''Video Director''' (amongst others). As a relatively new field of stagecraft, practitioners create their own definitions, rules and techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projctn.com/about-projection-design|title=About Projection Design  - Projctn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[Filmmaking]] and [[video production]] content has been used in performance for many years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/theater/18mcelroy.html|title=Projection Design Comes of Age|first=Steven|last=Mcelroy|date=18 May 2008|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as has large format [[slide projection]] delivered by systems such as the PANI projector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pani.com/unternehmen/daten/e_daten.html?english |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926111206/http://www.pani.com/unternehmen/daten/e_daten.html?english |archivedate=September 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The German [[Erwin Piscator]], as stage director at the Berlin [[Volksbühne]] in the 1920s, made extensive use of film projected onto his sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://myclone.wordpress.com/2010/01/28/field-guide-to-new-media-for-the-performing-arts/|title=Field Guide to New Media for the Performing Arts|first=David|last=Haden|date=28 January 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the development of digital projection technology in the mid 90s, and the resulting drop in price, made it more attractive and practical to live performance producers, directors and scenic designers. The role of the video designer has developed as a response to this, and in recognition of the demand in the industry for experienced professionals to handle the video content of a production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livedesignonline.com/theatre/projection_designer_scenic_tony_award_0430/|title=Sunday In The Park Projection Designer Being Considered For Scenic Tony Award|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United Scenic Artists]]' Local 829, the Union representing [[Scenic Artists]] in the USA has included "Projection Designers" as of mid- 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usa829.org/News.aspx?ItemID=109|title=News|first=|last=USA829|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means anybody working in this field will be doing so officially as "Projection Designer" if he or she is working under a union contract, even if the design utilises technology other than [[video projectors]]. The term "Projection Designer" stems from the days when slide and film projectors were the primary source of projection and is now in wide use across North America.

[http://www.arts.ac.uk/wimbledon/courses/postgraduate/ma-digital-theatre/ MA Digital Theatre], [[University of the Arts London]]  is the first Master's level course in the UK designed to teach video design exclusively as a specific discipline, rather than embedding it into scenic design. 
Also, Opera Academy Verona has a Workshop Laboratory from 2009 of Projection Design for Opera and Theatre, Directed from Carlo Saleti, Gianfranco Veneruci and Florian CANGA.

In the USA,  a number of programs started at about the same time reflecting the growing acceptance of the profession and the need for skilled projection designers. [[Yale University]] began a graduate level program in Projection Design in 2010.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.yale.edu/2009/10/30/school-drama-adds-new-concentration-projection-design|title=School of Drama Adds New Concentration in Projection Design|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's being headed by [[Wendall K. Harrington]]. [[CalArts]] had their concentration Video For Performance [https://theater.calarts.edu/programs/design-and-production/video-performance] since the mid-2000s and is currently led by Peter Flaherty while [[UT Austin]] started the MFA concentration [http://www.utexas.edu/finearts/tad/images/integrated-media/  Integrated Media for Live Performance]  also in 2010. It is being led by the Sven Ortel. Both the UT Austin and Yale program are part of an MFA in Design and graduated their first students in 2013.

== Roles of the video designer ==

Depending on the production, and due to the crossover of this field with the fields of [[lighting design]] and [[scenic design]], a video designer's roles and responsibilities may vary from show to show. A video designer may take responsibility for any or all of the following.

[[File:Production-timeline.jpg|thumb|Video Design for Theatre: Production Timeline &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://somethinggraphic.net/2013/11/10/who-will-make-up-the-video-team/|title=Video Know-How for Shows: Who will make up the video team?|first=|last=ninapixelpixie|date=10 November 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

* The overall conceptual design of the video content to be included in the piece, including working with the other members of the [[production team]] to ensure that the video content is integrated with the other design areas.
* The creation of this video content using [[animation|2D]] and [[3D animation]], [[motion graphics]], [[stop motion animation]], [[illustration]], [[filming]] or any other method.
* The management of live cameras, their signal and how it is used on stage as part of the design. 
* The [[Film Director|direction]], lighting and/or [[cinematography]] of any film clips included in the piece.
* The design of the technical system to deliver the video content, including the specification of [[video projectors]], [[LED display]]s, monitors and control systems, cabling routes and rigging positions for optimal video effects. 
* The management of the budget allocated to video, including the sourcing of display technologies and control technologies, their delivery, maintenance and insurance.

This is a very wide skills base, and it is not uncommon for a video designer to work with associates or assistants who can take responsibility for certain areas. For example, a video designer may conceptually design the video content, but hire a skilled [[animator]] to create it, a programmer to program the control system, a production engineer to designer and engineer the control system and a [[projectionist]] to choose the optimum projection positions and maintain the equipment.

== Concert video design ==
&lt;!-- "Concert video design" redirects here. Please update redirect if retitling section. --&gt;

'''Concert video design''' is a niche of the [[filmmaking]] and [[video production]] industry that involves the creation of original video content intended explicitly for display during a live [[concert]] performance.

The creation of visuals for live music performances bears close resemblance to [[music videos]], but are typically meant to be displayed as 'backplate' imagery that adds a visual component to the music performed onstage. However, as the use of video content during musical performances has grown in popularity since the turn of the 21st century, it has become more common to have self-standing 'introductory' and 'interstitial' videos that play on screen on stage without the performers. These pieces may include footage of the artist or artists, shot specifically for the video, and presented onstage with pre-recorded music so that the final appearance is essentially a music video. Such stand-alone videos, however, are typically only viewed in this live setting and may include additional theatrical [[sound effects]].

The earliest concert video visuals likely date to the period of the late 1960s when concerts for artists such as [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[The Doors]] featured [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] imagery on projection screens suspended behind the performers. Live concert performances took on more and more theatrical elements particularly notable in the concert events put on by [[Pink Floyd]] throughout their career.

[[Laurie Anderson]] was among the earliest to experiment with video content as part of a live performance, and her ideas and images continue to be a direct inspiration to performers as diverse as [[David Bowie]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Kanye West]]. Meanwhile, in 1982, [[Devo]] integrated rear-projected visuals into their concert set, choreographing themselves to match and interact with the action on screen for several songs. But the rock show that made video content 'standard practice' was [[U2]]'s [[Zoo TV Tour]] conceived and designed by [[Willie Williams (set designer)|Willie Williams]] - who has collaborated with [[Laurie Anderson]].

== Technology used in video design ==

Video designers make use of many technologies from the fields of [[stagecraft]], broadcast equipment and home cinema equipment to build a workable video system, including technologies developed specifically for live video and technologies appropriated from other fields. A video system may include any of the following:
