'''''A Lady Playing the Guitar''''' (after 1670s) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by an unknown copyist after a work by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Johannes Vermeer]]. It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is part of the collection of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].
[[File:Jan Vermeer van Delft 013.jpg|thumb|''[[The Guitar Player (Vermeer)|The Guitar Player]]'', original in [[Kenwood House]]]]
This painting by a follower of Vermeer was documented as authentic by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1908, who wrote; "26. A LADY PLAYING THE GUITAR.  [[Théophile Thoré-Bürger|B.]] 28. [[Henry Havard|H.]] 31.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn01hofsuoft#page/606/mode/1up Comparative table] of catalog entries between Bürger's and Havard's first [[Catalogue raisonné]] of Vermeer and Hofstede de Groot's list of Vermeer paintings in 1908&lt;/ref&gt;
A young lady with fresh red cheeks, wearing a white silk dress and a 
yellow jacket trimmed with ermine, sits on the left facing the spectator. 
Her figure is seen at three-quarter length. She looks with a smile at something above her to the left. Behind her is a table with a blue cloth, on 
which are several books. On the wall hangs a landscape. The scene is 
lighted from a window with a dark blue curtain on the right. The 
colours are delicately harmonised. The paint is thin. This picture 
belongs to about the same period as the [[Lady Standing at a Virginal|National Gallery picture (23)]]. 
Signed in full ; canvas, 19 1/2 inches by 16 1/2 inches. 
Exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] Winter Exhibition, 1892, No. 46. 
The picture was, after Vermeer's death in 1676, in the possession of his 
widow, Catharina Bolnes ; this picture, and "[[Lady Writing a Letter with her Maid|The Love Letter]]" in the Beit collection (35), were given as security for a debt of 617 florins. 
Sales. Amsterdam, May 16, 1696, No. 4 (70 florins). 
Ph. van der Schley and D. du Pre, Amsterdam, December 22, 1817, 
No. 62 (65 florins 5, Coclers). 
In the possession of the dealer Gruyter, Amsterdam. 
In the collections of J. H. C. Cremer, Brussels measuring, according to 
Bürger, 21 inches by 18 inches; of Lord Iveagh ; of Henry Bischoffsheim, 
London. 
In the possession of the dealer Gooden, London, 1896. 
Now in the collection of [[John G. Johnson]], Philadelphia."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn01hofsuoft#page/593/mode/1up entry 26 for A Lady Playing the Guitar] in Hofstede de Groot, 1908 {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later it became apparent that Hofstede de Groot (and Johnson G. Johnson) had been tricked and this was a copy of the version in Kenwood House. It is thanks to Johnson's deeply founded interest in art that all dubious attributions of paintings in his possession such as this one were allowed to remain in the collection, where it has become a quiet testament to the "Vermeer craze" at the turn of the 20th-century. Even after seeing the Kenwood House version, Hofstede de Groot was convinced of this painting's superiority, which demonstrates the skill of the unknown copyist. Needless to say the provenance records mentioned by Hofstede de Groot pertain to the Kenwood House version. It is still unknown where the dealer "Gooden" acquired the painting.

[[File:NASA High Flyers Alphabet Activity Book.pdf|thumb|Example of an activity book. ]]
An '''activity book''' is a type of [[book]], generally aimed at [[children]], which contains [[interactive]] content such as [[game]]s, [[puzzles]], [[quiz]]zes, pictures to colour and other elements which involve [[writing]] or [[drawing]] in the book itself. The book may, or may not, have a loose [[narrative]] or contain other non-interactive elements structured around the interactive elements. Activity books may be made for [[entertainment]], [[education]] or a mixture of both.

Specific types of activity books include [[colouring book]]s and [[puzzle book]]s. A book is normally referred to as an activity book if it combines a variety of interactive elements and does not fall neatly into one of these more specific categories.

== Examples ==
Activity books are typically centred around a particular theme. This may be a generic theme, e.g. dinosaurs, or based on a toy, television show, book, or game. 

For example, the [[Where's Wally?]] series of books (known as Where's Waldo? in the USA) by [[Martin Handford]] consists of both [[Puzzle book|puzzle books]], wherein the reader must search for characters hidden in pictures, and activity books such as ''[[Where's Waldo?: The Ultimate Fun Book]]'', which include a wider range of games and activities as well as puzzles. In 2018, [[Nintendo]] announced its intention to publish activity books based on its trademarked characters and games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/nintendo-childrens-activity-books-random-house/|title=Who says print is dead? Nintendo turns its attention to kids’ activity books|date=2018-05-04|work=Digital Trends|access-date=2018-06-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other franchises for which a number of activity books are available include:

'''''Afghan Girl''''' is a 1984 photographic portrait of '''Sharbat Gula''' ({{lang-ps|شربت ګله}}) (pronounced {{IPA-ps|ˈʃaɾbat|}}) (born {{circa|1972}}),  also known as '''Sharbat Bibi''', by journalist [[Steve McCurry]].&lt;ref name="Dawn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1165626/pakistan-issues-cnic-to-nat-geos-famed-afghan-girl|title=Pakistan issues CNIC to Nat Geo's famed 'Afghan Girl'|last=Ismail Khan|date=February 25, 2015|work=[[DAWN (newspaper)|DAWN]]|accessdate=7 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628132319/http://www.dawn.com/news/1165626/pakistan-issues-cnic-to-nat-geos-famed-afghan-girl|archivedate=28 June 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared on the June 1985 cover of ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]''. The image is of an adolescent girl with green eyes in a red headscarf looking intensely at the camera. The identity of the photo's subject was not initially known, but in early 2002, she was identified as Sharbat Gula. She was an [[Afghan]] woman who was living in the [[Nasir Bagh]] [[Afghans in Pakistan|refugee camp in Pakistan]] during the time of the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet occupation of Afghanistan]] when she was photographed.

It has been likened to [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s painting of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2002/03/12/afghan-girl.htm|title=National Geographic tracks down Afghan girl|last=Zoroya|first=Greg|date=2002-03-13|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=2012-02-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228174224/http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2002/03/12/afghan-girl.htm|archivedate=2012-02-28|deadurl=no|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meridian.org/insmallthingsremembered/hollywood-movie-poster-at-the-kabul-cinema|title=Hollywood movie poster at the Kabul Cinema|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222043007/http://www.meridian.org/insmallthingsremembered/hollywood-movie-poster-at-the-kabul-cinema|archivedate=2012-12-22|deadurl=no|accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been called "the First World's Third World ''Mona Lisa''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Just Advocacy?: Women's Human Rights, Transnational Feminisms, and the Politics of Representation|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780813535890|editor=Wendy S.

Gula was one of the students in an informal school in the [[Nasir Bagh]] [[refugee camp]] in 1984. Gula's photograph was taken by [[National Geographic Society]] photographer Steve McCurry on [[Kodachrome]] 64 color slide film, with a [[Nikon]] [[Nikon FM2|FM2]] camera and [[Nikon]] 105mm Ai-S F2.5 lens.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-print photo retouching was done by Graphic Art Service, based in [[Marietta, Georgia]]. McCurry did not record the name of the person he had photographed.

The picture, titled ''Afghan Girl'', appeared on the June 1985 cover of ''National Geographic''. The image of her face, with a red scarf draped loosely over her head and her eyes staring directly into the camera was named "the most recognized photograph" in the history of the magazine, and the cover itself is one of the most famous of the ''National Geographic''.&lt;ref&gt;

McCurry made several unsuccessful attempts during the 1990s to locate her.&lt;ref name="HesfordKozol2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hesford |first1=Wendy S. |last2=Kozol |first2=Wendy |title=Just Advocacy?: Women's Human Rights, Transnational Feminisms, and the Politics of Representation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7G5SPSay_dEC&amp;pg=PA1 |accessdate=7 September 2015 |year=2005 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=9780813535890 |pages=1– |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220212900/https://books.google.com/books?id=7G5SPSay_dEC&amp;pg=PA1 |archivedate=20 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2002, a ''National Geographic'' team traveled to Afghanistan to locate the subject. McCurry, upon learning that the Nasir Bagh refugee camp was soon to close, inquired of its remaining residents, one of whom knew Gula's brother and was able to send word to her hometown. However, a number of women came forward and identified themselves erroneously as the famous Afghan Girl. In addition, after being shown the 1984 photo, a handful of young men erroneously identified Gula as their wife.

The team located Gula, then around the age of 30, in a remote region of Afghanistan; she had returned to her native country from the refugee camp in 1992. Her identity was confirmed by [[John Daugman]] using [[iris recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; She recalled being photographed. She had been photographed on only three occasions: in 1984 and during the search for her when a ''National Geographic'' producer took the identifying pictures that led to the reunion with Steve McCurry. She had never seen the ''Afghan Girl'' image before it was shown to her in January 2002.

==Sharbat Gula==
[[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] by ethnicity and from a [[rural]] background, Gula's parents were killed during the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Soviet–Afghan War|bombing of Afghanistan]] when she was around six years old in their village in eastern [[Nangarhar Province|Nangarhar]]. Along with her grandmother, brother, and three sisters, she walked across the mountains to Pakistan and ended up in the Nasir Bagh refugee camp in Pakistan in 1984.&lt;ref name=ng&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2002/04/afghan-girl/index-text |title=Afghan Girl: A Life Revealed |last=Newman |first=Cathy |work=[[National Geographic Magazine]] |date=April 2002 |accessdate=2012-01-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113085238/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2002/04/afghan-girl/index-text |archivedate=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She married Rahmat Gul between the age of 13 and 16, and returned to her village in Afghanistan in 1992. She is now a widow as her husband died from [[Hepatitis C virus]] around 2012.&lt;ref name="abc-deport" /&gt; Gula has three daughters. A fourth daughter died in infancy. She expressed hopes that her children will be able to get an education. A devout Muslim, Gula normally would wear a burka and was hesitant to meet with McCurry, as he was a male from outside the family. When asked if she had ever felt safe, she responded "No. But life under the Taliban was better. At least there was peace and order." Until the ''National Geographic'' team found her again, she had never seen the photo of herself as a child. When asked how she had survived, she responded that it was "the will of God".&lt;ref name=ng /&gt;

In 2015, local newspapers in Pakistan reported that the [[National Database and Registration Authority]] (NADRA) canceled the Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC) to Sharbat Bibi and two men listed as her sons. Reports claimed the national ID cards had been issued illegally. A NADRA source is quoted as saying "They may not be her sons but this is a common practice among Afghan refugees whereby they list names of non-relatives as their children to obtain documents." A relative stated that the family lives in Pakistan, but "We travel between Pakistan and Afghanistan depending on the security situation."&lt;ref name="Dawn" /&gt;

On 26 October 2016, Gula was arrested in Pakistan by the [[Federal Investigation Agency]] for living in the country using forged documents.&lt;ref name=Express_Tribune&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/1210753/fia-arrests-natgeos-afghan-girl-peshawar/ |title=FIA arrests NatGeo's Afghan girl in Peshawar |newspaper=The Express Tribune |date=26 October 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026232441/http://tribune.com.pk/story/1210753/fia-arrests-natgeos-afghan-girl-peshawar/ |archivedate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/national-geographic-afghan-girl-arrested-pakistan-false-papers-sharbat-gula |title=National Geographic 'Afghan Girl' arrested in Pakistan living under false papers |last=Boone |first=Jon |date=2016-10-26 |newspaper=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077 |access-date=2016-10-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026234650/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/national-geographic-afghan-girl-arrested-pakistan-false-papers-sharbat-gula |archivedate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was sentenced to fifteen days in detention, and she was deported to Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="abc-deport" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2016/11/09/pakistan-deports-national-geographics-iconic-afghan-girl|title=Pakistan deports National Geographic's iconic 'Afghan Girl' |publisher=[[Toronto Sun]]|author=Lynne O'Donnell and Riaz Khan|date=November 9, 2016|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was criticised by [[Amnesty International]].&lt;ref name="abc-deport"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan to deport National Geographic's 'Afghan Girl' Sharbat Gula next week |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-05/pakistan-to-deport-national-geographic-afghan-girl-sharbat-gula/7997680 |accessdate=5 November 2016 |publisher=ABC News |agency=AP |date=5 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105133327/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-05/pakistan-to-deport-national-geographic-afghan-girl-sharbat-gula/7997680 |archivedate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kabul]], Gula and her children were welcomed by President [[Ashraf Ghani]] and former President [[Hamid Karzai]] at the [[Arg (Kabul)|presidential palace]].

'''Ajoka Theatre''' ([[Urdu]]: {{Nastaliq|اجوکا ناٹک}}, literal translation of ''Ajoka'': "today/present") is a [[Pakistan]]i [[not-for-profit arts organization]] based in [[Lahore]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], with focus on producing and performing social theatrical stage productions, founded in 1984.&lt;ref name="DSB"&gt;Singh Bajeli, Diwan (2 February 2007) [http://www.hindu.com/fr/2007/02/02/stories/2007020201230300.htm ''A voice for peace and amity''], The Hindu&lt;/ref&gt; The group was formed by director, actress and playwright, [[Madeeha Gauhar]] at peak of the tensions during the state of emergency under the regime of General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]].&lt;ref name="DSB" /&gt; Ajoka Theatre received the prestigious [[Prince Claus Awards|Prince Claus Award]]&lt;ref&gt;(16 December 2003) [http://www.dawn.com/news/223580/madeeha-gauhar-gets-dutch-award ''Madeeha Gauhar gets Dutch awards''], Dawn News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prince Claus Awards, [http://princeclausfund.org/en/programmes/awards award winners of 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006 and the [[Theatre Pasta Theatre Awards|International Theatre Pasta Award]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Theatre Pasta (16 July 2008) [http://theatrepasta.com/?p=81 interview] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219114602/http://theatrepasta.com/?p=81 |date=19 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, the group have staged many popular society critical pieces in theatres, on the streets and in public spaces, as well as in productions for television and on video. Ajoka Theatre has not only performed in Pakistan, but has also in the [[South Asia]]n region, in countries like [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]] and [[Sri Lanka]], as well as in [[Europe]] and [[United States of America]].&lt;ref name="PCA"&gt;Prince Claus Fund, [http://princeclausfund.org/en/network/user/id/241 profile]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group focuses on promotion of a [[justice|just]], [[Humanism|humane]], [[Secularity|secular]] and [[Egalitarianism|equal]] society, alongside the subject of [[women's rights]] in a society that is greatly dominated by men.&lt;ref name="DSB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PCA" /&gt;

The groups first ever theatrical performance was ''Jaloos (Procession)'' written by veteran Indian playwright [[Badal Sarkar]].&lt;ref name="DSB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khan, Sher (14 May 2014) [http://tribune.com.pk/story/708368/30-years-of-ajoka/ ''30 years of Ajoka''], The Express Tribune&lt;/ref&gt; The style of Ajoka's performances can be characterised as an elaboration on the [[oral tradition]] of [[Bhand]] and [[Nautanki]] that found a flourishing base in the area that currently overlaps the province of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]]. In spite of the Western education of Gauhar, she does not limit herself to classical Western theatre techniques. Instead, she mixes authentic Pakistani elements, combining it with contemporary sentiments.&lt;ref name="PCA" /&gt;

==History==
Gauhar was born in 1956 in [[Karachi]]. After she obtained a [[Master of Arts]] degree in [[English literature]], she moved to [[England]] where she obtained another master's degree, in [[theatre]] sciences at the [[University of London]].&lt;ref name="DSB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PCA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FR"&gt;Rashed, Fariha (16 October 2005) [https://archive.is/20130408022347/http://archives.dawn.com/weekly/images/archive/051016/images1.htm ''The Ajoka awakening'']&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, after returning to [[Lahore]], Gauhar and her husband [[Shahid Nadeem]] founded Ajoka Theatre, the first theatre group of significance there. 
 
In 2007, Ajoka performed a piece that was written and directed by Gauhar, called ''[[Burqavaganza]]'' (''[[Burqa]]-vaganza''), which led to great controversy. Actors dressed in burkas put themes on the stage like sexual discrimination, intolerance and fanaticism. From a Western perspective, the piece was a rather innocent performance on hypocrisy of a society that bathes in corruption. In her own country though, Members of Parliament called for a ban of it, and the Minister of Culture threatened with sanctions when it would be staged any longer. In spite of the ban, [[non-governmental organisation]]s and [[women's rights]] activists had the theatre piece translated into English and staged performances internationally as an sign of support to Ajoka.&lt;ref&gt;Rehman, Sonya (20 June 2008) [http://sonyarehman.wordpress.com/2008/06/20/viva-ajoka/ ''Viva Ajoka!''], Sonya Rehman's Archive ~ Of Most Things Pakistani&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borah, Prabalika M.

[[File:Alfred bruyas.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Portrait of Alfred Bruyas, [[Gustave Courbet]], 1854]]
'''Alfred Bruyas''' (15 August 1821 – 1 January 1876) was an art collector and a personal friend of many important artists of his time, among them [[Gustave Courbet]]. He donated his collection to the [[Musée Fabre]], in [[Montpellier]].

Born Jacques Louis Bruyas, he was the son of a wealthy banker in Montpellier. His interest in art was clear even at school.  In 1840 he studied at the studio of [[Charles Matet]], however he soon recognized the limits of his own talents and shifted his focus to the promotion and collection of contemporary art.

From 1849 to 1854 he spent most of his time in Paris. There he collected work by [[Louis Hector Allemand]], [[Camille Corot]], [[Thomas Couture]], [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Narcisse Diaz de Peña]], [[Adrien Guignet]], [[Adolphe Hervier]], [[Prosper Marilhat]], [[Edouard-Antoine Marsal]], [[Jean-François Millet]], [[Théodore Rousseau]], [[Philippe-Joseph Tassaert]], [[Marcel Verdier]] and [[Constant Troyon]], but above all the work of [[Gustave Courbet]].

'''Arcillera''' is a small village in the [[province of Zamora]], Spain, close to the border with [[Portugal]].

A [[Celts|Celtic]] hoard of silver jewellery and [[denarii]] dating to approximately 20 BC was found in Arcillera in the early twentieth century. It is now mostly preserved in the collections of the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=4791&amp;plaA=4791-3-1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''At the Moulin Rouge, the Dance''''' is an [[oil-on-canvas]] painted by [[France|French]] artist [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. It was painted in 1890, and is the second of a number of graphic paintings by Toulouse-Lautrec depicting the [[Moulin Rouge]] [[cabaret]] built in [[Paris]] in 1889. It portrays two dancers dancing the [[can-can]] in the middle of the crowded dance hall. A recently discovered inscription by Toulouse-Lautrec on the back of the painting reads: "The instruction of the new ones by Valentine the Boneless."&lt;ref name="PMA"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rishel|first=Joseph|title=Philadelphia Museum of Art: Handbook of the Collections|date=1995|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the man to the left of the woman dancing, is [[Valentin le désossé]], a well-known dancer at the Moulin Rouge, and he is teaching the newest addition to the cabaret. To the right, is a mysterious aristocratic women in pink. The background also features many aristocratic people such as poet Edward Yeats, the club owner and even Toulouse-Lautrec's father. The work is currently displayed at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].

|colspan=6|Coxeter notation expresses [[Coxeter group]]s as a list of branch orders of a [[Coxeter diagram]], like the [[polyhedral groups]], {{CDD|node|p|node|q|node}} = [p,q]. [[Dihedral symmetry in three dimensions|dihedral groups]], {{CDD|node|2|node|n|node}}, can be expressed a product [ ]×[n] or in a single symbol with an explicit order 2 branch, [2,n].

In [[geometry]], '''Coxeter notation''' (also '''Coxeter symbol''') is a system of classifying [[symmetry group]]s, describing the angles between fundamental reflections of a [[Coxeter group]] in a bracketed notation expressing the structure of a [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram]], with modifiers to indicate certain subgroups.  The notation is named after [[H. S. M. Coxeter]], and has been more comprehensively defined by [[Norman Johnson (mathematician)|Norman Johnson]].

== Reflectional groups==
{{Further information|Point group}}

For [[Coxeter group]]s, defined by pure reflections, there is a direct correspondence between the bracket notation and [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram]]. The numbers in the bracket notation represent the mirror reflection orders in the branches of the Coxeter diagram. It uses the same simplification, suppressing 2s between orthogonal mirrors.

The Coxeter notation is simplified with exponents to represent the number of branches in a row for linear diagram. So the ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; group is represented by [3&lt;sup&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sup&gt;], to imply ''n'' nodes connected by ''n-1'' order-3 branches. Example ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = [3,3] = [3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;] or [3&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt;] represents diagrams {{CDD|node|3|node|3|node}} or {{CDD|node|split1|nodes}}.

Coxeter initially represented bifurcating diagrams with vertical positioning of numbers, but later abbreviated with an exponent notation, like [...,3&lt;sup&gt;p,q&lt;/sup&gt;] or [3&lt;sup&gt;p,q,r&lt;/sup&gt;], starting with [3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;] or [3,3&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt;] = {{CDD|node|splitsplit1|branch3|node}} or  {{CDD|node|3|node|split1|nodes}} as D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Coxeter allowed for zeros as special cases to fit the ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; family, like ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = [3,3,3,3] = [3&lt;sup&gt;4,0,0&lt;/sup&gt;] = [3&lt;sup&gt;4,0&lt;/sup&gt;] = [3&lt;sup&gt;3,1&lt;/sup&gt;] = [3&lt;sup&gt;2,2&lt;/sup&gt;], like {{CDD|node|3|node|3|node|3|node|3|node}} = {{CDD|node|split1|nodes|3a|nodea|3a|nodea}} = {{CDD|node|split1|nodes|3ab|nodes}}.

Coxeter groups formed by cyclic diagrams are represented by parenthesese inside of brackets, like [(p,q,r)] = {{CDD|pqr}} for the [[triangle group]] (p q r). If the branch orders are equal, they can be grouped as an exponent as the length the cycle in brackets, like [(3,3,3,3)] = [3&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;], representing Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node|split1|nodes|split2|node}} or {{CDD|branch|3ab|branch}}. {{CDD|node|3|node|split1|branch}} can be represented as [3,(3,3,3)] or [3,3&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;].

More complicated looping diagrams can also be expressed with care. The [[Coxeter–Dynkin diagram#Ranks 4.E2.80.9310|paracompact Coxeter group]] {{CDD|node|split1|branch|split2|node}} can be represented by Coxeter notation [(3,3,(3),3,3)], with nested/overlapping parentheses showing two adjacent [(3,3,3)] loops, and is also represented more compactly as [3&lt;sup&gt;[&amp;nbsp;]×[&amp;nbsp;]&lt;/sup&gt;], representing the [[rhombus|rhombic symmetry]] of the Coxeter diagram. The paracompact complete graph diagram {{CDD|tet}} or  {{CDD|branch|splitcross|branch}}, is represented as [3&lt;sup&gt;[3,3]&lt;/sup&gt;] with the superscript [3,3] as the symmetry of its [[regular tetrahedron]] coxeter diagram.

The Coxeter diagram usually leaves order-2 branches undrawn, but the bracket notation includes an explicit '''2''' to connect the subgraphs. So the Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node|3|node|2|node|3|node}} = ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be represented by [3]×[3] = [3]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = [3,2,3]. Sometimes explicit 2-branches may be included either with a 2 label, or with a line with a gap: {{CDD|node|3|node|2x|node|3|node}} or {{CDD|node|3|node|3|2|3|node|3|node}}, as an identical presentation as [3,2,3].

For the affine and hyperbolic groups, the subscript is one less than the number of nodes in each case, since each of these groups was obtained by adding a node to a finite group's diagram.

== Subgroups ==
Coxeter's notation represents rotational/translational symmetry by adding a '''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''' superscript operator outside the brackets, [X]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; which cuts the order of the group [X] in half, thus a index 2 subgroup. This operator implies an even number of operators must be applied, replacing reflections with rotations (or translations). When applied to a Coxeter group, this is called a '''direct subgroup''' because what remains are only direct isometries without reflective symmetry.

The '''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''' operators can also be applied inside of the brackets, like [X,Y&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] or [X,(Y,Z)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], and creates '''"semidirect" subgroups''' that may include both reflective and nonreflective generators. Semidirect subgroups can only apply to Coxeter group subgroups that have even order branches adjacent to it. Elements by parentheses inside of a Coxeter group can be give a '''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''' superscript operator, having the effect of dividing adjacent ordered branches into half order, thus is usually only applied with even numbers. For example, [4,3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] and [4,(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ({{CDD|node|4|node_h2|3|node_h2|3|node_h2}}). 

If applied with adjacent odd branch, it doesn't create a subgroup of index 2, but instead creates overlapping fundamental domains, like [5,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = [5/2], which can define doubly wrapped polygons like a [[pentagram]], {5/2}, and [5,3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] relates to [[Schwarz triangle]] [5/2,3,3], [[polytope density|density]] 2.

Groups without neighboring '''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''' elements can be seen in ringed nodes Coxeter-Dynkin diagram for [[uniform polytope]]s and honeycomb are related to ''hole'' nodes around the '''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''' elements, empty circles with the alternated nodes removed. So the [[snub cube]], {{CDD|node_h|4|node_h|3|node_h}} has symmetry [4,3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|4|node_h2|3|node_h2}}), and the [[snub tetrahedron]], {{CDD|node|4|node_h|3|node_h}} has symmetry [4,3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ({{CDD|node|4|node_h2|3|node_h2}}), and a [[demicube]], h{4,3} = {3,3} ({{CDD|node_h|4|node|3|node}} or {{CDD|nodes_10ru|split2|node}} = {{CDD|node_1|3|node|3|node}}) has symmetry [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,3] = [3,3] ({{CDD|node_h2|4|node|3|node}} or {{CDD|node_h0|4|node|3|node}} = {{CDD|nodes|split2|node}} = {{CDD|node|3|node|3|node}}).

Note: [[Pyritohedral symmetry]] {{CDD|node|4|node_h2|3|node_h2}} can be written as {{CDD|node|4|2|node_h2|3|node_h2}}, separating the graph with gaps for clarity, with the generators {0,1,2} from the Coxeter group {{CDD|node_n0|4|node_n1|3|node_n2}}, producing pyritohedral generators {0,12}, a reflection and 3-fold rotation. And chiral tetrahedral symmetry can be written as  {{CDD|node_h0|4|node_h2|3|node_h2}} or  {{CDD|node_h2|2|4|node_h2|3|node_h2}}, [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = [3,3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, with generators {12,0120}.

Johnson extends the '''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''' operator to work with a placeholder 1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; nodes, which removes mirrors, doubling the size of the fundamental domain and cuts the group order in half.&lt;ref name="subgroups2"&gt;Johnson (2018), 11.6 ''Subgroups and extensions'', p 255, halving subgroups&lt;/ref&gt; In general this operation only applies to individual mirrors bounded by even-order branches. The '''1''' represents a mirror so [2p] can be seen as [2p,&lt;span style="color:#00ff00;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;], [&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;,2p], or [&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;,2p,&lt;span style="color:#00ff00;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;], like diagram {{CDD|node|2x|p|node}} or {{CDD|node_c1|2x|p|node_c3}}, with 2 mirrors related by an order-2p dihedral angle. The effect of a mirror removal is to duplicate connecting nodes, which can be seen in the Coxeter diagrams: {{CDD|node_h0|2x|p|node_c3}} = {{CDD|labelp|branch_c3}}, or in bracket notation:[1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2p, &lt;span style="color:#00ff00;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;] = [&lt;span style="color:#00ff00;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;,p,&lt;span style="color:#00ff00;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;] = [p].

Each of these mirrors can be removed so h[2p] = [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2p,1] = [1,2p,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = [p], a reflective subgroup index 2. This can be shown in a Coxeter diagram by adding a &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; symbol above the node: {{CDD|node_h0|2x|p|node}} = {{CDD|node|2x|p|node_h0}} = {{CDD|labelp|branch}}.

If both mirrors are removed, a quarter subgroup is generated, with the branch order becoming a gyration point of half the order: 
:q[2p] = [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2p,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = [p]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, a rotational subgroup of index 4. {{CDD|node_h2|2|2x|p|2|node_h2}} = {{CDD|node_h0|2x|p|node_h0}} = {{CDD|node_h0|2x|p|node_h2}} = {{CDD|node_h2|2x|p|node_h0}} =  {{CDD|labelp|branch_h2h2}}.

For example, (with p=2): [4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4] = [2] = [&amp;nbsp;]×[&amp;nbsp;], order 4. [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = [2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, order 2.

The opposite to halving is doubling&lt;ref name="subgroups"/&gt; which adds a mirror, bisecting a fundamental domain, and doubling the group order.
: {{Brackets|p}} = [2p]

Halving operations apply for higher rank groups, like [[tetrahedral symmetry]] is a half group of [[octahedral group]]: h[4,3] = [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,3] = [3,3], removing half the mirrors at the 4-branch. The effect of a mirror removal is to duplicate all connecting nodes, which can be seen in the Coxeter diagrams: {{CDD|node_h0|2x|p|node_c1|3|node_c2}} = {{CDD|labelp|branch_c1|split2|node_c2}}, h[2p,3] = [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2p,3] = [(p,3,3)].

If nodes are indexed, half subgroups can be labeled with new mirrors as composites. Like {{CDD|node_n0|2x|p|node_n1}}, generators {0,1} has subgroup {{CDD|node_h0|2x|p|node_n1}} = {{CDD|2_n0|node_n1|3_n0|p|node_n1}}, generators {1,010}, where mirror 0 is removed, and replaced by a copy of mirror 1 reflected across mirror 0. Also given {{CDD|node_n0|4|node_n1|3|node_n2}}, generators {0,1,2}, it has half group {{CDD|node_h0|4|node_n1|3|node_n2}} = {{CDD|node_n1|3|node_n2|3|3_n0|node_n1|2_n0}}, generators {1,2,010}.

Doubling by adding a mirror also applies in reversing the halving operation: {{Brackets|3,3}} = [4,3], or more generally {{Brackets|(q,q,p)}} = [2p,q].

=== Radical subgroups ===
[[File:43-radial subgroups.png|thumb|A radical subgroup is similar to an alternation, but removes the rotational generators.]]
Johnson also added an [[asterisk]] or star '''*''' operator for "radical" subgroups&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (2018), 11.6 ''Subgroups and extensions'', p 259, radical subgroup&lt;/ref&gt;, that acts similar to the &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; operator, but removes rotational symmetry. The index of the radical subgroup is the order of the removed element.  For example, [4,3*] ≅ [2,2]. The removed [3] subgroup is order 6 so [2,2] is an index 6 subgroup of [4,3].

The radical subgroups represent the inverse operation to an [[#Extended symmetry|extended symmetry]] operation. For example, [4,3*] ≅ [2,2], and in reverse [2,2] can be extended as [3[2,2]] ≅ [4,3]. The subgroups can be expressed as a Coxeter diagram: {{CDD|node_c1|4|node|3s|node}} or {{CDD|node_c1|4|node_x|3|node_x}} ≅ {{CDD|nodeab_c1|2|node_c1}}. The removed node (mirror) causes adjacent mirror virtual mirrors to become real mirrors.

If [4,3] has generators {0,1,2}, [4,3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], index 2, has generators {0,12}; [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,3] ≅ [3,3], index 2 has generators {010,1,2}; while radical subgroup [4,3*] ≅ [2,2], index 6, has generators {01210, 2, (012)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}; and finally [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,3*], index 12 has generators {0(12)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;0, (012)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;01}.

A '''trionic subgroup''' is an index 3 subgroups. There are many
Johnson defines a ''trionic subgroup'' with operator ⅄, index 3. For rank 2 Coxeter groups, [3], the trionic subgroup, [3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] is [ ], a single mirror. And for [3''p''], the trionic subgroup is [3''p'']&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt; ≅ [''p'']. Given {{CDD|node_n0|3x|p|node_n1}}, with generators {0,1}, has 3 trionic subgroups. They can be differentiated by putting the ⅄ symbol next to the mirror generator to be removed, or on a branch for both: [3''p'',1&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] = {{CDD|node_n0|3x|p|node_trionic}} = {{CDD|node_n0|p|3_n1|3_n0|node_n1|2_n0|2_n1}},  {{CDD|node_trionic|3x|p|node_n1}} = {{CDD|2_n0|2_n1|node_n0|3_n1|3_n0|p|node_n1}}, and [3''p''&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] = {{CDD|node_n0|3x|3trionic|p|node_n1}} = {{CDD|2_n0|node_n1|3_n0|p|3_n1|node_n0|2_n1}} with generators {0,10101}, {01010,1}, or {101,010}.

[[#Trionic subgroups of tetrahedral symmetry|Trionic subgroups of tetrahedral symmetry]]: [3,3]&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt; ≅ [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4], relating the symmetry of the [[regular tetrahedron]] and [[tetragonal disphenoid]].

For rank 3 Coxeter groups, [''p'',3], there is a trionic subgroup [''p'',3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] ≅ [''p''/2,''p''], or {{CDD|node_n0|2x|p|node_n1|3trionic|node_n2}} = {{CDD|2_n2|2_n1|node_n0|3_n1|3_n2|p|node_n0|2x|p|node_n1}}. For example the finite group [4,3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] ≅ [2,4], and Euclidean group [6,3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] ≅ [3,6], and hyperbolic group [8,3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] ≅ [4,8]. 

An odd-order adjacent branch, ''p'', will not lower the group order, but create overlapping fundamental domains. The group order stays the same, while the [[density (polytope)|density]] increases. For example the [[icosahedral symmetry]], [5,3], of the regular polyhedra [[icosahedron]] becomes [5/2,5], the symmetry of 2 regular star polyhedra. It also relates the hyperbolic tilings {p,3}, and [[List_of_regular_polytopes_and_compounds#Hyperbolic_star-tilings|star hyperbolic tilings]] {p/2,p} 

For rank 4, [''q'',2''p'',3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] = [2''p'',((p,q,q))], {{CDD|node|q|node|2x|p|node|3trionic|node}} = {{CDD|labelq|branch|split2-pq|node|2x|p|node}}. 

For example [3,4,3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] = [4,3,3], or {{CDD|node_n0|3|node_n1|4|node_n2|3trionic|node_n3}} = {{CDD|2_n3|2_n2|node_n1|3_n2|3_n3|3|node_n0|3|node_n1|4|node_n2}}, generators {0,1,2,3} in [3,4,3] with the trionic subgroup [4,3,3] generators {0,1,2,32123}. For hyperbolic groups, [3,6,3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] = [6,3&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;], and [4,4,3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] = [4,4,4].

[[File:33-trionic subgroups.png|thumb|Trionic relations of [3,3]]]
Johnson identified two specific '''trionic subgroups'''&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (2018), 11.6 ''Subgroups and extensions'', p 258, trionic subgroups&lt;/ref&gt; of [3,3], first an index 3 subgroup [3,3]&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt; ≅ [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4], with [3,3] ({{CDD|node_n0|3|node_n1|3|node_n2}} = {{CDD|node|split1|nodes}} = {{CDD|node|split1|branch|label2}}) generators {0,1,2}. It can also be written as [(3,3,2&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;)] ({{CDD|node|split1|2|branch_h2h2|label2}}) as a reminder of its generators {02,1}. This symmetry reduction is the relationship between the regular [[tetrahedron]] and the [[tetragonal disphenoid]], represent a stretching of a tetrahedron perpendicular to two opposite edges.

Secondly he identifies a related index 6 subgroup [3,3]&lt;sup&gt;Δ&lt;/sup&gt; or [(3,3,2&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|split1|2|branch_h2h2|label2}}), index 3 from [3,3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ≅ [2,2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, with generators {02,1021}, from [3,3] and its generators {0,1,2}.

These subgroups also apply within larger Coxeter groups with [3,3] subgroup with neighboring branches all even order.
[[File:334 trionic subgroups2.png|thumb|Trionic subgroup relations of [3,3,4]]]
For example, [(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4], [(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;,4], and [(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;Δ&lt;/sup&gt;,4] are subgroups of [3,3,4], index 2, 3 and 6 respectively. The generators of [(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;,4] ≅ {{Brackets|4,2,4}} ≅ [8,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,8], order 128, are {02,1,3} from [3,3,4] generators {0,1,2,3}. And [(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;Δ&lt;/sup&gt;,4] ≅ {{Brackets|4,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4}}, order 64, has generators {02,1021,3}. As well, [3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;,4,3&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;] ≅ [(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;,4].

Also related [3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;] = [3,3,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] has trionic subgroups: [3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt; = [(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;⅄&lt;/sup&gt;,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], order 64, and 1=[3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;Δ&lt;/sup&gt; = [(3,3)&lt;sup&gt;Δ&lt;/sup&gt;,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ≅ [[4,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, order 32.

=== Central inversion===
[[File:Point Reflection.png|thumb|A 2D central inversion is a 180 degree rotation, [2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]
A [[central inversion]], order 2, is operationally differently by dimension. The group [&amp;nbsp;]&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = [2&lt;sup&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sup&gt;] represents ''n'' orthogonal mirrors in n-dimensional space, or an [[n-flat]] subspace of a higher dimensional space. The mirrors of the group [2&lt;sup&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sup&gt;] are numbered {{tmath|0 \dots n-1}}. The order of the mirrors doesn't matter in the case of an inversion. The matrix of a central inversion is {{tmath|-I}}, the Identity matrix with negative one on the diagonal.

From that basis, the central inversion has a generator as the product of all the orthogonal mirrors. In Coxeter notation this inversion group is expressed by adding an alternation &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to each 2 branch. The alternation symmetry is marked on Coxeter diagram nodes as open nodes.

A [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram]] can be marked up with explicit 2 branches defining a linear sequence of mirrors, open-nodes, and shared double-open nodes to show the chaining of the reflection generators.

For example, [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2] and [2,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] are subgroups index 2 of [2,2], {{CDD|node|2|node|2|node}}, and are represented as {{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h2|2|node}} (or {{CDD|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h2|2|node}}) and {{CDD|node|2|node_h2|2x|node_h2}} (or {{CDD|node|2|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h2}}) with generators {01,2} and {0,12} respectively. Their common subgroup index 4 is [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], and is represented by {{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h4|2x|node_h2}} (or {{CDD|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h4|3|2|3|node_h2}}), with the double-open {{CDD|node_h4}} marking a shared node in the two alternations, and a single [[rotoreflection]] generator {012}.

=== Rotations and rotary reflections ===
Rotations and [[rotary reflection]]s are constructed by a single single-generator product of all the reflections of a prismatic group, [2''p'']×[2''q'']×... where [[Greatest common divisor|gcd]](''p'',''q'',...)=1, they are isomorphic to the abstract [[cyclic group]] Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, of order ''n''=2''pq''.

The 4-dimensional double rotations, [2''p''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''q''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] (with [[Greatest common divisor|gcd]](''p'',''q'')=1), which include a central group, and are expressed by Conway as ±[C&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;×C&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;ref&gt;Conway, 2003, p.46, Table 4.2 Chiral groups II&lt;/ref&gt;, order 2''pq''. From Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node_n0|2x|p|node_n1|2|node_n2|2x|q|node_n3}}, generators {0,1,2,3}, the single generator of [2''p''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''q''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], {{CDD|node_h2|2x|p|node_h4|2x|node_h4|2x|q|node_h2}} is {0123}. The half group, [2''p''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''q''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, or cyclc graph, [(2''p''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''q''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)], {{CDD|3|node_h4|2x|p|node_h4|2x|node_h4|2x|q|node_h4|2x}} expressed by Conway is [C&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;×C&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;], order ''pq'', with generator {01230123}.

If there is a common factor ''f'', the double rotation can be written as {{frac|1|''f''}}[2''pf''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''qf''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] (with [[Greatest common divisor|gcd]](''p'',''q'')=1), generator {0123}, order 2''pqf''. For example, ''p''=''q''=1, ''f''=2, {{frac|1|2}}[4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] is order 4. And {{frac|1|''f''}}[2''pf''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''qf''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, generator {01230123}, is order ''pqf''. For example {{frac|1|2}}[4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is order 2, a [[central inversion]].

Simple groups with only odd-order branch elements have only a single rotational/translational subgroup of order 2, which is also the [[commutator subgroup]], examples [3,3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [3,5]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [3,3,3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [3,3,5]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. For other Coxeter groups with even-order branches, the commutator subgroup has index 2&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;, where c is the number of disconnected subgraphs when all the even-order branches are removed.&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter and Moser, 1980, Sec 9.5 Commutator subgroup, p. 124–126&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [4,4] has three independent nodes in the Coxeter diagram when the '''4'''s are removed, so its commutator subgroup is index 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and can have different representations, all with three '''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''' operators: [4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, or [(4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)]. A general notation can be used with +''c'' as a group exponent, like [4,4]&lt;sup&gt;+3&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Example subgroups ===

==== Rank 2 example subgroups ====
[[Dihedral symmetry]] groups with even-orders have a number of subgroups. This example shows two generator mirrors of [4] in red and green, and looks at all subgroups by halfing, rank-reduction, and their direct subgroups. The group [4], {{CDD|node_n0|4|node_n1}} has two mirror generators 0, and 1. Each generate two virtual mirrors 101 and 010 by reflection across the other.

==== Rank 3 Euclidean example subgroups ====
The [4,4] group has 15 small index subgroups. This table shows them all, with a yellow fundamental domain for pure reflective groups, and alternating white and blue domains which are paired up to make rotational domains. Cyan, red, and green mirror lines correspond to the same colored nodes in the Coxeter diagram. Subgroup generators can be expressed as products of the original 3 mirrors of the fundamental domain, {0,1,2}, corresponding to the 3 nodes of the Coxeter diagram, {{CDD|node_n0|4|node_n1|4|node_n2}}. A product of two intersecting reflection lines makes a rotation, like {012}, {12}, or {02}. Removing a mirror causes two copies of neighboring mirrors, across the removed mirror, like {010}, and {212}. Two rotations in series cut the rotation order in half, like {0101} or {(01)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}, {1212} or {(02)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}. A product of all three mirrors creates a [[transreflection]], like {012} or {120}.

{{See also|Goursat tetrahedron#Extended symmetry}}

Coxeter's notation includes double square bracket notation, {{Brackets|X}} to express [[automorphism|automorphic]] symmetry within a Coxeter diagram. Johnson added alternative of angled-bracket &lt;[X]&gt; or {{langle}}[X]{{rangle}} option as equivalent to square brackets for doubling to distinguish diagram symmetry through the nodes versus through the branches. Johnson also added a prefix symmetry modifier [Y[X]], where Y can either represent symmetry of the Coxeter diagram of [X], or symmetry of the fundamental domain of [X].

For example, in 3D these equivalent [[rectangle]] and [[Rhombus|rhombic]] geometry diagrams of &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{A}}_3&lt;/math&gt;: {{CDD|branch|3ab|3ab|branch}} and {{CDD|node|split1|nodes|split2|node}}, the first doubled with square brackets, {{Brackets|3&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;}} or twice doubled as [2[3&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]], with [2], order 4 higher symmetry. To differentiate the second, angled brackets are used for doubling, {{langle}}[3&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]{{rangle}} and twice doubled as {{langle}}2[3&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]{{rangle}}, also with a different [2], order 4 symmetry. Finally a full symmetry where all 4 nodes are equivalent can be represented by [4[3&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]], with the order 8, [4] symmetry of the [[Square (geometry)|square]]. But by considering the [[tetragonal disphenoid]] fundamental domain the [4] extended symmetry of the square graph can be marked more explicitly as [(2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4)[3&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] or [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4[3&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]].

Further symmetry exists in the cyclic &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{A}}_n&lt;/math&gt; and branching &lt;math&gt;D_3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{E}}_6&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{D}}_4&lt;/math&gt; diagrams. &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{A}}_n&lt;/math&gt; has order 2''n'' symmetry of a regular ''n''-gon, {''n''}, and is represented by [''n''[3&lt;sup&gt;[''n'']&lt;/sup&gt;]]. &lt;math&gt;D_3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{E}}_6&lt;/math&gt; are represented by [3[3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;]] = [3,4,3] and [3[3&lt;sup&gt;2,2,2&lt;/sup&gt;]] respectively while &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{D}}_4&lt;/math&gt; by [(3,3)[3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;]] = [3,3,4,3], with the diagram containing the order 24 symmetry of the regular [[tetrahedron]], {3,3}. The paracompact hyperbolic group &lt;math&gt;{\bar{L}}_5&lt;/math&gt; = [3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;], {{CDD|node|branch3|splitsplit2|node|split1|nodes}}, contains the symmetry of a [[5-cell]], {3,3,3}, and thus is represented by [(3,3,3)[3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;]] = [3,4,3,3,3].

An [[asterisk]] * superscript is effectively an inverse operation, creating ''radical subgroups'' removing connected of odd-ordered mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;Norman W. Johnson, Asia Ivić Weiss, ''Quaternionic modular groups'', Linear Algebra and its Applications, Volume 295, Issues 1–3, 1 July 1999, Pages 159–189 [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002437959900107X]&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking at generators, the double symmetry is seen as adding a new operator that maps symmetric positions in the Coxeter diagram, making some original generators redundant. For 3D [[space group]]s, and 4D point groups, Coxeter defines an index two subgroup of {{Brackets|X}}, {{Brackets|X|&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which he defines as the product of the original generators of [X] by the doubling generator. This looks similar to {{Brackets|X}}&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the chiral subgroup of {{Brackets|X}}. So for example the 3D space groups {{Brackets|4,3,4}}&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (I432, 211) and {{Brackets|4,3,4|&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}} (Pm{{overline|3}}n, 
223) are distinct subgroups of {{Brackets|4,3,4}} (Im{{overline|3}}m, 229).

== Computation with reflection matrices as symmetry generators ==

A Coxeter group, represented by [[Coxeter diagram]] {{CDD|node_n0|p|node_n1|q|node_n2}}, is given Coxeter notation [p,q] for the branch orders. Each node in the Coxeter diagram represents a mirror, by convention called ρ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (and matrix R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;). The ''generators'' of this group [p,q] are reflections: ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ρ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and ρ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Rotational subsymmetry is given as products of reflections: By convention, σ&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt; (and matrix S&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; represents a rotation of angle π/p, and σ&lt;sub&gt;1,2&lt;/sub&gt; = ρ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a rotation of angle π/q, and σ&lt;sub&gt;0,2&lt;/sub&gt; = ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represents a rotation of angle π/2.

[p,q]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, {{CDD|node_h2|3_n0|3_n1|p|node_h2|3|q|3_n1|3_n2|node_h2}}, is an index 2 subgroup represented by two rotation generators, each a products of two reflections: σ&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt;, σ&lt;sub&gt;1,2&lt;/sub&gt;, and representing rotations of π/''p'', and π/''q'' angles respectively.

With one even branch, [''p''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''q''], {{CDD|node_h2|3_n0|3_n1|p|node_h2|2x|q|node_n2}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3_n0|3_n1|p|node_h2|2|2x|q|node_n2}}, is another subgroup of index 2, represented by rotation generator σ&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt;, and reflectional ρ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

With even branches, [2''p''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''q''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], {{CDD|node_h2|3_n0|3_n1|3_n2|2x|p|node_h4|2x|q|node_h2}}, is a subgroup of index 4 with two generators, constructed as a product of all three reflection matrices: By convention as: ψ&lt;sub&gt;0,1,2&lt;/sub&gt; and ψ&lt;sub&gt;1,2,0&lt;/sub&gt;, which are [[rotary reflection]]s, representing a reflection and rotation or reflection.

In the case of affine Coxeter groups like {{CDD|node_n0|4|node_n1|4|node_n2}}, or {{CDD|node_n0|infin|node_n1}}, one mirror, usually the last, is translated off the origin. A [[translation (mathematics)|translation]] generator τ&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt; (and matrix T&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt;) is constructed as the product of two (or an even number of) reflections, including the affine reflection. A [[transreflection]] (reflection plus a translation) can be the product of an odd number of reflections φ&lt;sub&gt;0,1,2&lt;/sub&gt; (and matrix V&lt;sub&gt;0,1,2&lt;/sub&gt;), like the index 4 subgroup {{CDD|node_n0|4|node_n1|4|node_n2}}: [4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = {{CDD|node_h2|3_n0|3_n1|3_n2|4|node_h4|4|node_h2}}.

Another composite generator, by convention as ζ (and matrix Z), represents the [[Inversion in a point|inversion]], mapping a point to its inverse. For [4,3] and [5,3], ζ = (ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;h/2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''h'' is 6 and 10 respectively, the [[Coxeter number]] for each family. For 3D Coxeter group [p,q] ({{CDD|node|p|node|q|node}}), this subgroup is a rotary reflection [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;].

Coxeter groups are categorized by their rank, being the number of nodes in its [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram]]. The structure of the groups are also given with their abstract group types: In this article, the abstract [[dihedral group]]s are represented as ''Dih''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[cyclic group]]s are represented by ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, with ''Dih''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Rank 2 ===
Example, in 2D, the Coxeter group [p] ({{CDD|node|p|node}}) is represented by two reflection matrices R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, The cyclic symmetry [p]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|p|node_h2}}) is represented by rotation generator of matrix S&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Rank 3 ===
The finite rank 3 Coxeter groups are [1,''p''], [2,''p''], [3,3], [3,4], and [3,5].

To reflect a point through a plane &lt;math&gt;ax + by + cz = 0&lt;/math&gt; (which goes through the origin), one can use &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I}-2\mathbf{NN}^T &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}&lt;/math&gt; is the 3x3 identity matrix and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the three-dimensional [[unit vector]] for the vector normal of the plane.  If the [[L2 norm]] of &lt;math&gt;a, b,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is unity, the transformation matrix can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \left [\begin{smallmatrix} 1 - 2 a^2  &amp; - 2 a b &amp; - 2 a c \\ - 2 a b  &amp; 1 - 2 b^2 &amp; - 2 b c  \\ - 2 a c &amp; - 2 b c &amp; 1 - 2c^2 \end{smallmatrix}\right ]&lt;/math&gt;

==== Dihedral symmetry====
The reducible 3-dimensional finite reflective group is [[dihedral symmetry]], [''p'',2], order 4''p'', {{CDD|node_n0|p|node_n1|2|node_n2}}. The reflection generators are matrices R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=(R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;×R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;=(R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;×R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;=(R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;×R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=Identity. [''p'',2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|p|node_h2|2x|node_h2}}) is generated by 2 of 3 rotations: S&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;1,2&lt;/sub&gt;, and S&lt;sub&gt;0,2&lt;/sub&gt;. An order ''p'' [[rotoreflection]] is generated by V&lt;sub&gt;0,1,2&lt;/sub&gt;, the product of all 3 reflections.

== Rank one groups==
{{Further information|One-dimensional symmetry group}}
In one dimension, the ''bilateral group'' [&amp;nbsp;] represents a single mirror symmetry, abstract ''Dih''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, symmetry [[Order (group theory)|order]] 2. It is represented as a [[Coxeter–Dynkin diagram]] with a single node, {{CDD|node}}. The ''[[identity group]]'' is the direct subgroup [&amp;nbsp;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, symmetry order 1. The '''+''' superscript simply implies that alternate mirror reflections are ignored, leaving the identity group in this simplest case. Coxeter used a single open node to represent an alternation, {{CDD|node_h2}}.

== Rank two groups==
{{Further information|Point groups in two dimensions}}
[[File:Regular hexagon symmetries2.png|400px|thumb|A regular [[hexagon]], with markings on edges and vertices has 8 symmetries: [6], [3], [2], [1], [6]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [1]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, with [3] and [1] existing in two forms, depending whether the mirrors are on the edges or vertices.]]
In two dimensions, the ''[[rectangle|rectangular]] group'' [2], abstract ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, also can be represented as a [[direct product]] [ ]×[ ], being the product of two bilateral groups, represents two orthogonal mirrors, with Coxeter diagram, {{CDD|node|2|node}}, with [[Order (group theory)|order]] 4. The '''2''' in [2] comes from linearization of the orthogonal subgraphs in the Coxeter diagram, as {{CDD|node|2x|node}} with explicit branch order 2. The ''rhombic group'', [2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h2}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h2}}), half of the rectangular group, the [[point reflection]] symmetry, Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, order 2.

Coxeter notation to allow a '''1''' place-holder for lower rank groups, so [1] is the same as [ ], and [1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] or [1]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is the same as [ ]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node_h2}}.

The ''full p-gonal group'' [p], abstract ''[[dihedral group]]'' D&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, ([[Nonabelian group|nonabelian]] for p&gt;2), of [[Order (group theory)|order]] 2''p'', is generated by two mirrors at angle ''π''/''p'', represented by Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node|p|node}}. The ''p-gonal'' subgroup [p]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, ''[[cyclic group]]'' ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, of order ''p'', generated by a rotation angle of&amp;nbsp;''&amp;pi;''/''p''.

Coxeter notation uses double-bracking to represent an [[automorphism|automorphic]] ''doubling'' of symmetry by adding a bisecting mirror to the [[fundamental domain]]. For example, &lt;nowiki&gt;[[p]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; adds a bisecting mirror to [p], and is isomorphic to [2p].

In the limit, going down to one dimensions, the ''full [[apeirogon]]al group'' is obtained when the angle goes to zero, so [∞], abstractly the [[infinite dihedral group]] D&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;, represents two parallel mirrors and has a Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node|infin|node}}. The ''[[One-dimensional symmetry group#Translational symmetry|apeirogonal group]]'' [∞]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, {{CDD|node_h2|infin|node_h2}}, abstractly the infinite [[cyclic group]] Z&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;, [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the ''additive group'' of the [[integers]], is generated by a single nonzero translation.

In the hyperbolic plane, there is a ''full [[pseudogon]]al group'' [''iπ/λ''], and ''pseudogonal subgroup'' [''iπ/λ'']&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, {{CDD|node_h2|ultra|node_h2}}. These groups exist in regular infinite-sided polygons, with edge length λ. The mirrors are all orthogonal to a single line.

In three dimensions, the ''full orthorhombic group'' or ''orthorectangular'' [2,2], abstractly ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[Order (group theory)|order]] 8, represents three orthogonal mirrors, (also represented by Coxeter diagram as three separate dots {{CDD|node|2|node|2|node}}). It can also can be represented as a [[direct product]] [ ]×[ ]×[ ], but the [2,2] expression allows subgroups to be defined:

First there is a "semidirect" subgroup, the ''orthorhombic group'', [2,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ({{CDD|node|2|node_h2|2x|node_h2}} or {{CDD|node|2|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h2}}), abstractly ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;×''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, of order 4.  When the '''+''' superscript is given inside of the brackets, it means reflections generated only from the adjacent mirrors (as defined by the Coxeter diagram, {{CDD|node|2|node|2|node}}) are alternated. In general, the branch orders neighboring the '''+''' node must be even. In this case [2,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] and [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2] represent two isomorphic subgroups that are geometrically distinct. The other subgroups are the ''pararhombic group'' [2,2]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h2|2x|node_h2}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h2}}), also order 4, and finally the ''[[Point reflection|central group]]'' [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ({{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h4|2x|node_h2}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h4|3|2|3|node_h2}}) of order 2.

Next there is the ''full ortho-''p''-gonal group'', [2,p] ({{CDD|node|2|node|p|node}}), abstractly ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;×''D''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;=''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×''D''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, of order 4p, representing two mirrors at a [[dihedral angle]] π/''p'', and both are orthogonal to a third mirror. It is also represented by Coxeter diagram as {{CDD|node|p|node|2|node}}.

The direct subgroup is called the para-''p''-gonal group, [2,p]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h2|p|node_h2}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h2|p|node_h2}}), abstractly ''D''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, of order 2p, and another subgroup is [2,p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ({{CDD|node|2|node_h2|p|node_h2}}) abstractly ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;×''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, also of order 2p.

The ''full gyro-p-gonal group'', [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''p''] ({{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h2|2x|p|node}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h2|2|p|node}}), abstractly ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, of order 4''p''. The gyro-''p''-gonal group, [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ({{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h4|2x|p|node_h2}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3|2|3|node_h4|2x|p|node_h2}}), abstractly ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, of order 2''p'' is a subgroup of both [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2''p''] and [2,2''p''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;].

The [[polyhedral group]]s are based on the symmetry of [[platonic solid]]s: the [[tetrahedron]], [[octahedron]], [[cube]], [[icosahedron]], and [[dodecahedron]], with [[Schläfli symbol]]s {3,3}, {3,4}, {4,3}, {3,5}, and {5,3} respectively. The Coxeter groups for these are: [3,3] ({{CDD|node|3|node|3|node}}), [3,4] ({{CDD|node|3|node|4|node}}), [3,5] ({{CDD|node|3|node|5|node}}) called full [[tetrahedral symmetry]], [[octahedral symmetry]], and [[icosahedral symmetry]], with orders of 24, 48, and 120.
[[File:Pyritohedral in icosahedral symmetry.png|thumb|[[Pyritohedral symmetry]], [3+,4] is an index 5 subgroup of [[icosahedral symmetry]], [5,3].]]
In all these symmetries, alternate reflections can be removed producing the rotational tetrahedral [3,3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;({{CDD|node_h2|3|node_h2|3|node_h2}}), octahedral [3,4]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|3|node_h2|4|node_h2}}), and icosahedral [3,5]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ({{CDD|node_h2|3|node_h2|5|node_h2}}) groups of order 12, 24, and 60. The octahedral group also has a unique index 2 subgroup called the [[pyritohedral symmetry]] group, [3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4] ({{CDD|node_h2|3|node_h2|4|node}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3|node_h2|2|4|node}}), of order 12, with a mixture of rotational and reflectional symmetry. Pyritohedral symmetry is also an index 5 subgroup of icosahedral symmetry: {{CDD|node_n0|5|node_n1|3|node_n2}} --&gt; {{CDD|2_n0|node_n1|3_n0|4|node_h2|3_n1|3_n2|node_h2}}, with virtual mirror '''1''' across '''0''', {010}, and 3-fold rotation {12}.

The tetrahedral group, [3,3] ({{CDD|node|3|node|3|node}}), has a doubling {{Brackets|3,3}} (which can be represented by colored nodes {{CDD|node_c1|3|node_c2|3|node_c1}}), mapping the first and last mirrors onto each other, and this produces the [3,4] ({{CDD|node|3|node|4|node}} or {{CDD|node_c2|3|node_c1|4|node}}) group. The subgroup [3,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ({{CDD|node|3|node|2|4|2|node_h2}} or {{CDD|node|3|node|4|node_h0}}) is the same as [3,3], and [3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4,1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] ({{CDD|node_h2|3|node_h2|2|4|2|node_h2}} or {{CDD|node_h2|3|node_h2|4|node_h0}}) is the same as [3,3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

{{See|List of planar symmetry groups}}

In the Euclidean plane there's 3 fundamental reflective groups generated by 3 mirrors, represented by Coxeter diagrams {{CDD|node|4|node|4|node}}, {{CDD|node|6|node|3|node}}, and {{CDD|node|split1|branch}}, and are given Coxeter notation as [4,4], [6,3], and [(3,3,3)]. The parentheses of the last group imply the diagram cycle, and also has a shorthand notation [3&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;].

{{Brackets|4,4}} as a doubling of the [4,4] group produced the same symmetry rotated π/4 from the original set of mirrors.

Direct subgroups of rotational symmetry are: [4,4]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [6,3]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and [(3,3,3)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. [4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,4] and [6,3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] are semidirect subgroups.

== Complex reflections==
[[File:Rank2_shephard_subgroups3.png|thumb|All subgroup relations on rank 2 Shephard groups.]]
Coxeter notation has been extended to [[Complex vector space|Complex space]], C&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; where nodes are [[unitary reflection]]s of period greater than 2. Nodes are labeled by an index, assumed to be 2 for ordinary real reflection if suppressed. [[Complex reflection group]]s are called [[Shephard group]]s rather than [[Coxeter group]]s, and can be used to construct [[complex polytope]]s.

In &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^1&lt;/math&gt;, a rank 1 shephard group {{CDD|pnode}}, order ''p'', is represented as &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[], []&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; or ]&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[. It has a single generator, representing a 2''&amp;pi;''/''p'' radian rotation in the [[Complex plane]]: &lt;math&gt;e^{2\pi i/p}&lt;/math&gt;.

Coxeter writes the rank 2 complex group, &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[''q'']&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; represents [[Coxeter diagram]] {{CDD|pnode|3|q|3|rnode}}. The ''p'' and ''r'' should only be suppressed if both are 2, which is the real case [''q'']. The order of a rank 2 group &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[''q'']&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is &lt;math&gt;g = 8/q(1/p+2/q+1/r-1)^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter, Regular Complex Polytopes, 9.7 Two-generator subgroups reflections. pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt;

The rank 2 solutions that generate complex polygons are: &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (''p'' is 2,3,4,...), &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[3]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[6]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[3]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[8]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[6]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[5]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;[3]&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[10]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;[6]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and &lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with Coxeter diagrams {{CDD|pnode|4|node}}, {{CDD|3node|3|3node}}, {{CDD|3node|6|node}}, {{CDD|3node|4|3node}}, {{CDD|4node|3|4node}}, {{CDD|3node|8|node}}, {{CDD|4node|6|node}}, {{CDD|4node|4|3node}}, {{CDD|3node|5|3node}}, {{CDD|5node|3|5node}}, {{CDD|3node|10|node}}, {{CDD|5node|6|node}}, {{CDD|5node|4|3node}}.

Infinite groups are &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[12]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[8]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;[6]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[6]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and &lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;[3]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; or {{CDD|3node|12|node}}, {{CDD|4node|8|node}}, {{CDD|6node|6|node}}, {{CDD|3node|6|3node}}, {{CDD|6node|4|3node}}, {{CDD|4node|4|4node}}, {{CDD|6node|3|6node}}.

Index 2 subgroups exists by removing a real reflection: &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[2''q'']&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[''q'']&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;. Also index ''r'' subgroups exist for 4 branches: &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[''r'']&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;.

For the infinite family &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, for any ''p'' = 2, 3, 4,..., there are two subgroups: &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; [''p''], index ''p'', while and &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[4]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[]×&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;[], index 2.

''''' David with the Head of Goliath ''''' is a painting by the Italian [[Baroque]] artist [[Caravaggio]]. It is housed in the [[Galleria Borghese]], Rome.&lt;ref name="Puglisi-360-180"&gt;Catherine Puglisi, ''Caravaggio'' (Phaidon, 1998), p. 360, plate 180&lt;/ref&gt; The painting, which was in the collection of Cardinal [[Scipione Borghese]]{{efn|"Caravaggio painted for Cardinal Scipione Borghese "a half-figure of David. The head of Goliath, which David holds by the hair, is a self-portrait. He represents David as a bareheaded youth, one shoulder out of his shirt, grasping his sword by the hilt. The color is of the boldest depths and shadows in order to give the figures and composition the force Caravaggio always required."&lt;ref name=Mascardi&gt;{{cite book| first= Giovanni Pietro | last= Bellori | year=1672| title= ''Vite de'Pittori, Scultori et Architetti Moderni'', Parte Prima| editor = | pages=208| publisher=Mascardi |location=Rome |id= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aEk_AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Vite+de'Pittori,+Scultori+et+Architetti&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-CEA7ytHPI&amp;sig=ts741mfIzRzWfm8KvB_BAFJVkYU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8_JCUML2HM2pqwG714DQBA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Vite%20de'Pittori%2C%20Scultori%20et%20Architetti&amp;f=false| authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt; translation by Friedlaender 1955, ed. 1974.&lt;ref name=Friedlaender&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedlaender|first1=Walter|title=Caravaggio Studies|date=1955|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=0691003084|pages=202-203|edition=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} in 1650,&lt;ref name=Friedlaender/&gt; has been dated as early as 1605 and as late as 1609–1610, with more recent scholars tending towards the former.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, David. "Self and Myth in Caravaggio's David and Goliath." Caravaggio: Realism, Rebellion, Reception. 2006. 36–46 &lt;/ref&gt;

Caravaggio also treated this subject in a [[David with the Head of Goliath (Caravaggio), Vienna|work]] dated c. 1607, currently in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]], and in an early work dated c. 1600 in the [[Museo del Prado|Prado]] in Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/art-work/david-with-the-head-of-goliath/c3895900-73d4-4257-97fb-240e3aaf0402|title=David with the head of Goliath|last=|first=|date=|website=Museo del Prado|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate inspiration for Caravaggio was a work by a follower of [[Giorgione]], c.1510, but Caravaggio captures the drama more effectively by having the head dangling from David's hand and dripping blood, rather than resting on a ledge.&lt;ref name="Puglisi-360-180" /&gt; The sword in David's hand carries an abbreviated inscription H-AS OS; this has been interpreted as an abbreviation of the Latin phrase ''humilitas occidit superbiam'' ("humility kills pride").&lt;ref name="Puglisi-360-180" /&gt;

David is perturbed, "his expression mingling sadness and compassion."&lt;ref name="Puglisi-360-180" /&gt; The decision to depict him as pensive rather than jubilant creates an unusual psychological bond between him and Goliath. This bond is further complicated by the fact that Caravaggio has depicted himself as Goliath, while the model for David is ''il suo Caravaggino'' ("his own little Caravaggio"). This most plausibly refers to [[Cecco del Caravaggio]], the artist's studio assistant in Rome some years previously, recorded as the boy "who lay with him." No independent portraits of Cecco are known, making the identification impossible to verify, but "[a] sexual intimacy between David/model and Goliath/painter seems an inescapable conclusion, however, given that Caravaggio made David's sword appear to project upward, suggestively, between his legs and at an angle that echoes the diagonal linking of the protagonist's gaze to his victim."&lt;ref name="Puglisi-361-180"&gt;Catherine Puglisi, ''Caravaggio'' (Phaidon, 1998), p.361, plate 180&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, based on the portrait of Caravaggio done by Ottavio Leoni, this may be a double self-portrait. The young Caravaggio (his own little Caravaggio) wistfully holds the head of the adult Caravaggio. The wild and riotous behavior of the young Caravaggio essentially had destroyed his life as a mature adult, and he reflects with a familiar hermeticism on his own condition in a painting of a related religious subject.

The masterpiece in Rome is a "twin" of a second artwork on the same subject, David and Goliath, as reported in the inventory of the Galleria Borghese dated 1693, where is found that one was located in the first room, and the other in the fourth room. &lt;ref&gt;Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, Ugo Bozzi publisher in Rome&lt;/ref&gt;

The biographical interest of the painting adds another layer of meaning to an already complex work, David and Goliath standing for Christ and Satan and the triumph of good over evil in orthodox Christian iconography of the period, and also as the cold-hearted beloved who "kills" and his lover according to contemporary literary conceit.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Puglisi, ''Caravaggio'' (Phaidon, 1998), pp.360–361, plate 180&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the genre can be seen in the contemporary ''Judith and Holofernes'' of [[Cristofano Allori]] in the [[Pitti Palace]], where Allori depicts himself as Holofernes,&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Puglisi, ''Caravaggio'' (Phaidon, 1998), p.361, plate 181&lt;/ref&gt; although Caravaggio has depicted David not as cruel and indifferent but as deeply moved by Goliath's death.&lt;ref name="Puglisi-361-180" /&gt;

If the painting was a gift to Cardinal Borghese, the papal official with the power to grant Caravaggio a pardon for murder, it can also be interpreted as a personal plea for mercy. "''David with the Head of Goliath'' [thus] demonstrates Caravaggio's gift for distilling his own experiences into an original sacred imagery that transcends the personal to become a searing statement of the human condition."&lt;ref name="Puglisi-361-180" /&gt;

[[Massimo Stanzione]]'s '''''David with the Head of Goliath''''' is exhibited at the [[San Diego Museum of Art]].

== History ==
In 1947, Mrs. Harry Turpin gifted a Stanzione original painting titled ''David With the Head of Goliath'' to the Fine Arts Gallery of San Diego (now the [[San Diego Museum of Art]]); the work was then attributed to [[Jusepe Ribera|Ribera]], but was reattributed to Stanzione by Mario Modestini in 1951, an attribution confirmed by Schleier, Felton, Zeri, and Spinosa. The painting is dated to approximately 1630. [[Caravaggio]] was an important influence in Stanzione’s artistic style and this painting illustrates a combination of styles from Caravaggio’s brutally realistic elements and dramatic lighting to classical 17th-century artistic trends including the lyrical style of Bologna artists. This painting shows David in an elegant posture, which softens the goriness, i.e. the dismembered head of [[Goliath]]. The theatrical lighting of this painting is a perfect demonstration of the chiaroscuro interpretation by Stanzione. [[Guido Reni]] and Caravaggio can be credited for Stanzione’s interpretation of [[chiaroscuro]]; they were supposedly his teachers. It was only after the painting was donated, that experts noticed under gallery lighting some aberrations in the canvas such as unevenness and crackle patterns. Those aberrations, along with the fact that young David appears to be gazing at something in the lower left corner led to suspicions that the canvas had been altered. By 1999, with the use of x-rays and careful removal of surface paint, the original paint of Goliath’s forehead was revealed. After intensive restoration, Goliath’s full face was uncovered and the painting restored to its original form. The full painting depicts Goliath’s dismembered head in the lower left corner, with David, knife in hand, gazing down to the lower left corner. It is believed that the head of Goliath was painted over in order to make the painting less gory and more appealing to potential buyers.

'''The Door of the Dead''', also known as the '''Door of Death''', is a [[bronze]] door sculpted by [[Giacomo Manzù]] between 1961 and 1964 by commission of [[Pope John XXIII]]. The door is located on the leftmost side of the [[narthex]] of [[St. Peter's Basilica]], in the [[Vatican City]], and leads to the interior of the basilica. It is called the ''Door of the Dead'' because it was traditionally used as an exit for funeral processions.&lt;ref name=Door1&gt;{{cite web|title=Door of Death|url=http://stpetersbasilica.info/Interior/DoorofDeath/DoorofDeath.htm|publisher=stpetersbasilica.info|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements==
The door is composed of ten panels which depict the [[Christianity|Christian]] meaning of [[death]]. The panels are arranged in five rows and two columns. The top half of the door depicts the deaths of [[Jesus]] and [[Mary Magdalene|Mary]], spread across two panels. The two central panels show a vine branch and wheat, which are shown as being turned into wine and bread in symbolic tribute to the [[Eucharist]]. The bottom panels depict the deaths of [[Abel]], [[Saint Joseph]], [[Saint Peter]], [[Pope John XXIII]], [[Saint Stephen]], [[Pope Gregory VII]], and two allusions to the [[personification of Death]]. Beneath these depictions are a row of six animals: a [[True thrush|blackbird]], a [[dormouse]], a [[hedgehog]], an [[owl]], a [[tortoise]] and a [[raven]]. The inside of the door shows the artist's dedication to Pope John XXIII&lt;ref name=Door1/&gt;, a portrayal of John XXIII receiving the bishops on the first day of the [[Second Vatican Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stpetersbasilica.info/Docs/Basilica-Square2.htm#doors|title=The doors|publisher=St. Peter's - Guide to Basilica &amp; Square|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manzù signed the work with the imprint of his right hand on the inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Selz|first=Peter|title=Giacomo Manzù and his portal for St Peter's|date=December 2001|work=[[Sculpture (magazine)|Sculpture]]|volume=v20|number=10|url=https://www.sculpture.org/documents/scmag01/dec01.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The door is considered to be Manzù's most controversial work.{{fact|date=August 2014}} The corporeal depictions of death were considered disturbing by some Vatican officials, who preferred depictions of a more spiritual nature. Officials were also wary of Manzù's professed [[Communism|communist]] ideology and allusions to executions of [[Fascism|fascists]] in the panels of the door.&lt;ref name="Simons"&gt;{{cite web|last=Simons|first=Marlise|title=Giacomo Manzu Is Dead at 82; Prolific Sculptor of Varied Images|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/19/obituaries/giacomo-manzu-is-dead-at-82-prolific-sculptor-of-varied-images.html|work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=17 November 2013|date=19 January 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these controversies, the door has remained in operation at the basilica.

[[File:Bookshop2.jpg|thumb|A small selection of covers from The Douglas Hyde Gallery's recent publications. Clockwise from top left: Matthew Day Jackson, Fergus Feehily, Ciaran Murphy, James Castle.]]
'''The Douglas Hyde Gallery''' is a publicly funded [[contemporary art]] gallery situated within the historical setting of [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], Dublin, Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeout.com/dublin/art/venue/1:5169/douglas-hyde-gallery Douglas Hyde Gallery review], ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'', Dublin.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Gallery opened in 1978, it was for a number of years Ireland's only public gallery of contemporary art. Today, in an abundance of smaller galleries and exhibition spaces in Dublin, The Douglas Hyde Gallery continues to sustain its reputation for holding exhibitions by some of the most established and well-regarded Irish and international artists working today.

The Douglas Hyde Gallery consists of two exhibition spaces that are used to show concurrent exhibitions, which often have a relating theme or tone.

== Gallery 1 ==
Gallery 1, designed by [[Paul Koralek]] of [[ABK Architects]], is the Gallery's main space and has played host to solo-exhibitions by renowned artists such as [[Peter Fischli &amp; David Weiss|Fischli/Weiss]], [[Marlene Dumas]], [[Gabriel Orozco]] and [[Peter Doig]]. Notable Irish artists who have exhibited in Gallery 1 include: [[Dorothy Cross]], [[Willie Doherty]], [[Gerard Byrne (artist, born 1969)|Gerard Byrne]], Patrick Graham, Patrick Hall, [[Michael Warren (sculptor)|Michael Warren]] and Kathy Prendergast.

== Gallery 2 ==
[[File:Marlene Dumas the-douglas hyde gallery.jpg|thumb|Installation photograph of 'The Paradise [4]' by Marlene Dumas in Gallery 2, The Douglas Hyde Gallery, December 2001]]
Gallery 2, which opened in 2001, was designed by McCullough Mulvin Architects. In addition to exhibitions by contemporary artists, this space is often used to show small collections of [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] objects and artefacts which are generally marginalised by larger museums and galleries. The most popular of these exhibitions have included: Nepalese Shamanic objects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.douglashydegallery.com/exhibition.php?intProjectID=51 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213205416/http://www.douglashydegallery.com/exhibition.php?intProjectID=51 |archivedate=13 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese Tea Bowls&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.douglashydegallery.com/exhibition.php?intProjectID=25 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710145808/http://www.douglashydegallery.com/exhibition.php?intProjectID=25 |archivedate=10 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ghanaian [[Asafo]] Fante Flags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.douglashydegallery.com/exhibition.php?intProjectID=19 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213232001/http://www.douglashydegallery.com/exhibition.php?intProjectID=19 |archivedate=13 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of exhibitions in Gallery 2 fall under ‘The Paradise’ series of shows, which invites artists to create a new work or present a series of works based on their own idea of ‘The Paradise’. As of February 2011, there have been 34 exhibitions in The Paradise series.

== Publications ==
The Douglas Hyde Gallery produces publications for many of its exhibitions. These books can take the form of [[exhibition catalogue]]s, artists’ books or curated projects and, while extremely different in content, they all share a similar exterior presentation. Since 2002, the Gallery has published over forty books in this small, hardback format.

The Leaves &amp; Papers series of books and leaflets is an ongoing project which allows The Douglas Hyde Gallery to produce and publish ideas, images and texts relating to a specific theme or concept which does not always relate directly the Gallery's programme.

Another ongoing series of books documents the Galley's programme while also highlighting some of the central principles of the Gallery and its exhibitions. The books explore ideas about visual culture, identity, and spirituality through carefully selected texts and imagery. These books include: the bread and butter stone, 1997; Patmos, 1999; 33 Happy Moments, 2003; Alabama Chrome, 2007; The Bridge, 2008; Questions of Travel, 2009; Saunter, 2010.

== Music ==
The Douglas Hyde Gallery has become increasingly well known for its programme of musical events. In recent years, [[Cat Power]], [[Sufjan Stevens]] and [[Laura Veirs]] have all played in the Gallery. Sometimes the musical performances relate directly to exhibitions: In 2008, [[Jandek]] performed a concert to coincide with an exhibition of his album covers and in 2009, [[Jim White (musician)|Jim White]] played a gig to celebrate the opening of his exhibition of ephemera from the [[Southern United States|American South]]. It is more often the case that the performances and exhibitions share a mood or atmosphere rather than a direct connection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1542">'''Figurative Constructivism''' is an art movement that arose principally in Germany. The term was introduced by [[Franz Seiwert]] in 1929 using the phrase "gegenständlichen constructive", and this was subsequently taken up by [[Gerd Arntz]] and then by art historians more generally.&lt;ref name=BB&gt;Benus B. (2013) 'Figurative Constructivism and sociological graphics' in ''Isotype: Design and Contexts 1925-71'' London: Hyphen Press, pp.216-248&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to the development of the [[Isotype (picture language)|Isotype]]. As Seiwert wrote "From the expressionist-cubist art-form abstract constructivism was developed, which in turn led into Figurative Constructivism".&lt;ref name=Kap&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kapounová|first1=Eliška|title=Grafická tvorba Augustina Tschinkela v kontextu moderního designu (1928 – 1940)|url=https://is.muni.cz/th/110838/ff_b/bak_Tschinkel_muni.pdf|publisher=Masarykova univerzita|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''a bis z''==
In October 1929 Seiwert, [[Heinrich Hoerle]] and [[Walter Stern (art critic)|Walter Stern]] produced the first issue of ''A bis Z'', subtitled "organ of the progressive artists group". It featured five artists from four towns: Seiwert and Hoerle ([[Cologne]]), [[Augustin Tschinkel]] ([[Prague]]), [[Peter Alma]] [[Amsterdam]] and Arntz ([[Vienna]]).&lt;ref name=BB/&gt; Tschinkel and Alma were both colleagues of Arntz at the [[Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsmuseum]] run by [[Otto Neurath]] in Vienna.&lt;ref name=BB/&gt;

The '''Foundation for Contemporary Arts''' ('''FCA'''), is a nonprofit based foundation in [[New York City]] that offers financial support and recognition to contemporary performing and visual artists through awards for artistic innovation and potential.  It was established in 1963 as the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts by artists [[Jasper Johns]], [[John Cage]], and others.

FCA was founded on the principle of "Artists for Artists" support as visual artists united to sponsor performance artists through grants funded by the sale of donated artworks.  The first benefit exhibition was at the Allan Stone Gallery in 1963. Among contributors to the Foundation's first benefit exhibition were [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Elaine de Kooning]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], and [[Andy Warhol]].&lt;ref name=Granted2013&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/04/22/granted|title=Granted|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its establishment, FCA has awarded more than 2,500 non-restrictive grants to individual artists and art organizations through its seven grant programs: ''Grants to Artists'', ''Emergency Grants'', the biennial ''John Cage Award'', the biennial ''Merce Cunningham Award'', the annual ''Robert Rauschenberg Award'', the annual ''Ellsworth Kelly Award'', and the annual ''Dorothea Tanning Award''.

FCA is located at 820 [[Greenwich Street]] in the [[West Village]] neighborhood of New York City.

== History ==
In late 1962, [[John Cage]], [[Jasper Johns]], and [[Robert Rauschenberg]] wanted to help [[Merce Cunningham Dance Company]] finance a season on Broadway. Each donated an artwork to be sold to cover the loss that would be incurred but realized that the sales might generate a bit more than would be needed. Asked what should happen to the excess, Cunningham remarked that other performers "are in the same boat" and should be helped.&lt;ref name=Granted2013 /&gt; Cage and Johns expanded the idea by establishing the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts.  They invited other artists to contribute works to an exhibition at the Allan Stone Gallery, which opened February 25, 1963 — and firmly established the Foundation's roots in the community of artists.&lt;ref name=Artists1963&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1963/03/09/artists-for-artists|title=Artists for Artists|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lee Bontecou]], [[Elaine de Kooning]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], Marisol, [[Barnett Newman]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Elaine Sturtevant]], and [[Andy Warhol]] were among the sixty-seven artists who contributed to this landmark show. With proceeds from the exhibition, the Foundation began making grants to individual artists.&lt;ref name=aboutpage&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foundationforcontemporaryarts.org/about|title=Foundation for Contemporary Arts|website=www.foundationforcontemporaryarts.org|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its first year, FCA made grants to composers [[Earle Brown]] and [[Morton Feldman]] and underwrote a concert of their music presented at [[The Town Hall (New York City)|Town Hall]] in New York. Additional grants went to [[Judson Memorial Church]], the [[Paper Bag Players]], choreographers [[Trisha Brown]], [[Lucinda Childs]], [[Meredith Monk]], [[Yvonne Rainer]], and [[Twyla Tharp]]; and composers [[Philip Glass]], [[Steve Reich]], and [[La Monte Young]].&lt;ref name=aboutpage /&gt;

== Grant programs ==
=== Grants to Artists ===
Grants to Artists are unrestricted, annual $40,000 awards made to provide recipients with the financial means to engage in their choice of artistic endeavors. Recipients are selected from confidential nominations. FCA invites dozens of artists and arts professionals to anonymously propose one exceptional individual, collective, or performing group. Then, FCA’s Directors, together with an advisor in each discipline, select grantees based on the merit and imaginativeness of their work and the impact such support might have at this point in their careers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/reviews/g182/rauschenberg-foundation/?slide=2|title=Lasting Assets|date=2013-03-01|newspaper=Town &amp; Country Magazine|language=en|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emergency Grants ===
Emergency Grants are awarded on an ongoing basis to emerging artists and collectives throughout the United States who are in need of timely, urgent support. Emergency Grants provides quick, grassroots support to artists who have unexpected expenses when projects are close to completion or sudden opportunities to present work to the public.

Nietzsche's body of work touched a wide range of topics, including art, [[philology]], history, religion, [[tragedy]], culture and science. His early inspiration was drawn from figures such as [[Arthur Schopenhauer]],&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt; [[Richard Wagner]]&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt; and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt; His writing spans philosophical [[polemic]]s, poetry, [[cultural critic]]ism and fiction while displaying a fondness for [[aphorism]] and [[irony]].&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, A.

A strict example of a cause-and-effect mismatch, with regard to the God-creator as the cause and our concepts as the effects, is perhaps not fully stressed in this fragment, but the more ''explicit'' it is stressed in the same book, chapter ""Reason" in philosophy", 4, as well as in ''The Antichrist'' (57, where real and imaginary origins are contrasted, and 62, where he calls Christianity 'a fatality'—'fatal' also meaning 'unavoidable') and in ''The Genealogy of Morals'', books 1–3, among others.  The topic of "''false'' origins" of ideas is also suggested in ''The Four Great Errors'', 3, and (precisely about morality) in e.g. ''The Will to Power'', tr. W.

Nietzsche's thought enjoyed renewed popularity in the 1960s and his ideas have since had a profound impact on 20th and early-21st century thinkers across philosophy—especially in schools of [[continental philosophy]] such as [[existentialism]], [[postmodernism]] and [[post-structuralism]]—as well as art, literature, [[psychology]], politics and popular culture.&lt;ref name="Raymond A.

==Life==
===Youth (1844–1868)===
{{anchor|youth}}
Born on 15 October 1844, Nietzsche grew up in the small town of [[Röcken]], near [[Leipzig]], in the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[Province of Saxony]]. He was named after King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia]], who turned 49 on the day of Nietzsche's birth (Nietzsche later dropped his middle name Wilhelm).{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=22}} Nietzsche's parents, Carl Ludwig Nietzsche (1813–1849), a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] pastor and former teacher; and {{ill|Franziska Nietzsche|de|Franziska Oehler}} (1826–1897), married in 1843, the year before their son's birth. They had two other children: a daughter, [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]], born in 1846; and a second son, Ludwig Joseph, born in 1848. Nietzsche's father died from a brain ailment in 1849; Ludwig Joseph died six months later at age two.&lt;ref name="Wicks"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/nietzsche/ |title=Friedrich Nietzsche |last=Wicks |first=Robert |date=1 January 2014 |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |edition=Winter 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family then moved to [[Naumburg]], where they lived with Nietzsche's maternal grandmother and his father's two unmarried sisters. After the death of Nietzsche's grandmother in 1856, the family moved into their own house, now [[Nietzsche-Haus, Naumburg|Nietzsche-Haus]], a museum and Nietzsche study centre.

[[File:Nietzsche1861.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Nietzsche, 1861]]
Nietzsche attended a boys' school and then a private school, where he became friends with Gustav Krug, [[Rudolf Wagner]] and Wilhelm Pinder, all of whom came from highly respected families.

In 1854, he began to attend Domgymnasium in [[Naumburg]]. Because his father had worked for the state (as a pastor) the now-fatherless Nietzsche was offered a scholarship to study at the internationally recognized [[Pforta|Schulpforta]] (the claim that Nietzsche was admitted on the strength of his academic competence has been debunked: his grades were nowhere near the top of the class).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brobjer|first1=Thomas H.|title=Why Did Nietzsche Receive a Scholarship to Study at Schulpforta?|journal=Nietzsche-Studien|volume=30|pages=322–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He transferred and studied there from 1858 to 1864, becoming friends with [[Paul Deussen]] and Carl von Gersdorff. He also found time to work on poems and musical compositions. Nietzsche led "Germania", a music and literature club, during his summers in Naumburg.&lt;ref name="Wicks"/&gt; At [[Schulpforta]], Nietzsche received an important grounding in languages—Greek, Latin, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and French—so as to be able to read important [[primary source]]s;&lt;ref&gt;Krell, David Farrell, and Donald L. Bates. ''The Good European: Nietzsche's work sites in word and image''. University of Chicago Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; he also experienced for the first time being away from his family life in a small-town conservative environment. His end-of-semester exams in March 1864 showed a 1 in Religion and German; a 2a in Greek and Latin; a 2b in French, History, and Physics; and a "lackluster" 3 in Hebrew and Mathematics.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=37}}

While at [[Pforta]], Nietzsche had a penchant for pursuing subjects that were considered unbecoming. He became acquainted with the work of the then almost-unknown poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin]], calling him "my favorite poet" and composing an essay in which he said that the mad poet raised consciousness to "the most sublime ideality."&lt;ref&gt;Hayman, Ronald. ''Nietzsche: A Critical Life'', p. 42. Oxford University Press, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher who corrected the essay gave it a good mark but commented that Nietzsche should concern himself in the future with healthier, more lucid, and more "German" writers. Additionally, he became acquainted with [[Ernst Ortlepp]], an eccentric, blasphemous, and often drunken poet who was found dead in a ditch weeks after meeting the young Nietzsche but who may have introduced Nietzsche to the music and writing of [[Richard Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, Joachim. ''Nietzsche &amp; Wagner: A Lesson in Subjugation'', p. 17. Yale University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps under Ortlepp's influence, he and a student named Richter returned to school drunk and encountered a teacher, resulting in Nietzsche's demotion from first in his class and the end of his status as a [[Prefect#Academic|prefect]].{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=21}}

After graduation in September 1864,&lt;ref&gt;His "valedictorian paper" (''Valediktionsarbeit'', graduation thesis for Pforta students) was titled "On [[Theognis of Megara]]" ("''De Theognide Megarensi''"); see Anthony K. Jensen, Helmut Heit (eds.), ''Nietzsche as a Scholar of Antiquity'', A&amp;C Black, 2014, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche commenced studies in theology and classical philology at the [[University of Bonn]] with hope of becoming a minister. For a short time he and Deussen became members of the [[Burschenschaft]] ''[[Franconia|Frankonia]]''. After one semester (and to the anger of his mother), he stopped his theological studies and lost his faith.&lt;ref name=Schaberg&gt;{{Citation |last=Schaberg |first=William |title=The Nietzsche Canon |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1996 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as his 1862 essay "Fate and History", Nietzsche had argued that historical research had discredited the central teachings of Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Jörg |last=Salaquarda |contribution=Nietzsche and the Judaeo-Christian tradition |title=The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche |place=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1996 |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[David Strauss]]'s ''[[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|Life of Jesus]]'' also seems to have had a profound effect on the young man.&lt;ref name=Schaberg/&gt; In addition, [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]'s ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' influenced young Nietzsche with its argument that people created God, and not the other way around.&lt;ref name=Higgins&gt;{{Citation |last=Higgins |first=Kathleen |title=What Nietzsche Really Said|publisher=Random House, NY |year=2000|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1865, at the age of 20, Nietzsche wrote to his sister Elisabeth, who was deeply religious, a letter regarding his loss of faith. This letter contains the following statement:

Nietzsche subsequently concentrated on studying philology under Professor [[Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl]], whom he followed to the [[University of Leipzig]] in 1865.{{sfn|Magnus|1999}} There, he became close friends with his fellow student [[Erwin Rohde]]. Nietzsche's first philological publications appeared soon after.

In 1865, Nietzsche thoroughly studied the works of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. He owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading Schopenhauer's ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' and later admitted that Schopenhauer was one of the few thinkers whom he respected, dedicating the essay "[[s:Schopenhauer as Educator|Schopenhauer as Educator]]" in the ''[[Untimely Meditations]]'' to him.

In 1866, he read [[Friedrich Albert Lange]]'s ''[[History of Materialism and Critique of its Present Importance|History of Materialism]]''. Lange's descriptions of [[Kant]]'s anti-materialistic philosophy, the rise of European [[Materialism]], Europe's increased concern with science, [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]], and the general rebellion against tradition and authority intrigued Nietzsche greatly. Nietzsche would ultimately argue the impossibility of an evolutionary explanation of the human aesthetic sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pence |first=Charles H. |title=Nietzsche's aesthetic critique of Darwin |journal=History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=165–90 |year=2011 |pmid=22288334 |url=https://www.academia.edu/759427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, Nietzsche signed up for one year of voluntary service with the Prussian artillery division in Naumburg. He was regarded as one of the finest riders among his fellow recruits, and his officers predicted that he would soon reach the rank of captain. However, in March 1868, while jumping into the saddle of his horse, Nietzsche struck his chest against the [[Saddle|pommel]] and tore two muscles in his left side, leaving him exhausted and unable to walk for months.&lt;ref&gt;Hayman, Ronald.

[[s:Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche#To Freiherr Karl Von Gersdorff – June, 1868|Letter to Karl Von Gersdorff]], June 1868.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Nietzsche turned his attention to his studies again, completing them in 1868 and meeting with [[Richard Wagner]] for the first time later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Selected_Letters_of_Friedrich_Nietzsche#To_Rohde_-_October.2C_1868 |title=Letter to Rohde |date=November 1868 |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professor at Basel (1869–1878)===

[[File:Rohde Gersdorff Nietzsche.JPG|thumb|upright|From left to right: [[Erwin Rohde]], Karl von Gersdorff and Nietzsche, October 1871]]
In part because of Ritschl's support, Nietzsche received a remarkable offer in 1869 to become professor of [[classical philology]] at the [[University of Basel]] in Switzerland. He was only 24 years old and had neither completed his doctorate nor received a teaching certificate ("[[habilitation]]"). He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the [[Leipzig University|University of Leipzig]], again with Ritschl's support.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony K. Jensen, Helmut Heit (eds.), ''Nietzsche as a Scholar of Antiquity'', A&amp;C Black, 2014, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that the offer came at a time when he was considering giving up philology for science, he accepted.{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=25}} To this day, Nietzsche is still among the youngest of the tenured Classics professors on record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Paul |last=Bishop |title=Nietzsche and Antiquity |year=2004 |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche's 1870 projected [[doctoral thesis]], ''Contribution toward the Study and the Critique of the Sources of Diogenes Laertius'' (''Beiträge zur Quellenkunde und Kritik des Laertius Diogenes''), examined the origins of the ideas of [[Diogenes Laërtius]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony K. Jensen, Helmut Heit (eds.), ''Nietzsche as a Scholar of Antiquity'', A&amp;C Black, 2014, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Though never submitted, it was later published as a ''Gratulationsschrift'' (congratulatory publication) at [[Basel]].&lt;ref&gt;George E. McCarthy, [http://personal.kenyon.edu/mccarthy/Book1.htm ''Dialectics and Decadence'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Between 1868 and 1870, he published two other studies on Diogenes Laertius: ''De Fontibus Diogenis Laertii'' ("On the Sources of Diogenes Laertius"; Part I: 1868, Part II: 1869) and ''Analecta Laertiana'' (1870); see Jensen and Heit (eds.), 2014, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before moving to Basel, Nietzsche renounced his Prussian citizenship: for the rest of his life he remained officially [[Stateless person|stateless]].&lt;ref&gt;Hecker, Hellmuth: "Nietzsches Staatsangehörigkeit als Rechtsfrage", ''Neue Juristische Wochenschrift'', Jg. 40, 1987, nr. 23, pp. 1388–91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;His, Eduard: "Friedrich Nietzsches Heimatlosigkeit", ''Basler Zeitschrift für Geschichte und Altertumskunde'', vol. 40, 1941, p. 159–86. Note that some authors (among them Deussen and [[Mazzino Montinari|Montinari]]) mistakenly claim that Nietzsche became a Swiss citizen.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Nietzsche served in the Prussian forces during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870–1871) as a medical [[orderly]]. In his short time in the military, he experienced much and witnessed the traumatic effects of battle. He also contracted [[diphtheria]] and [[dysentery]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] speculates that he might also have contracted [[syphilis]] at a brothel along with his other infections at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sax|first1=L.|title=What was the cause of Nietzsche's dementia?|journal=[[Journal of Medical Biography]]|volume=11|issue=1|pages=47–54|year=2003|pmid=12522502|doi=10.1177/096777200301100113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Richard |last=Schain |title=The Legend of Nietzsche's Syphilis |place=Westwood |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=2001}}.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On returning to Basel in 1870, Nietzsche observed the establishment of the [[German Empire]] and [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s subsequent policies as an outsider and with a degree of skepticism regarding their genuineness. His inaugural lecture at the university was "[[s:Homer and Classical Philology|Homer and Classical Philology]]". Nietzsche also met [[Franz Overbeck]], a professor of theology who remained his friend throughout his life. [[Afrikan Spir]], a little-known Russian philosopher responsible for the 1873 ''Thought and Reality'', and Nietzsche's colleague the famed historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]], whose lectures Nietzsche frequently attended, began to exercise significant influence on him during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Green, M.S. ''Nietzsche and the Transcendental Tradition''. University of Illinois Press, 2002.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche had already met [[Richard Wagner]] in Leipzig in 1868 and later Wagner's wife, [[Cosima Wagner|Cosima]]. Nietzsche admired both greatly and during his time at Basel frequently visited Wagner's house in [[Tribschen]] in [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]]. The Wagners brought Nietzsche into their most intimate circle—including [[Franz Liszt]], of whom Nietzsche colloquially described: "Liszt or the art of running after women!".&lt;ref&gt;[[Rupert Hughes]], [http://www.bookrags.com/ebooks/11419/1.html#gsc.tab=0 ''The Love Affairs of Great Musicians, Volume 2''].&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche enjoyed the attention he gave to the beginning of the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Bayreuth Festival]]. In 1870, he gave Cosima Wagner the manuscript of "The Genesis of the Tragic Idea" as a birthday gift. In 1872, Nietzsche published his first book, ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]''. However, his colleagues within his field, including Ritschl, expressed little enthusiasm for the work in which Nietzsche eschewed the classical philologic method in favor of a more speculative approach. In his [[polemic]] ''Philology of the Future'', [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]] dampened the book's reception and increased its notoriety. In response, Rohde (then a professor in [[Kiel]]) and Wagner came to Nietzsche's defense. Nietzsche remarked freely about the isolation he felt within the philological community and attempted unsuccessfully to transfer to a position in philosophy at Basel instead.

[[File:Friedrich Nietzsche-1872.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Nietzsche, c. 1872]]
In 1873, Nietzsche began to accumulate notes that would be posthumously published as ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]''. Between 1873 and 1876, he published four separate long essays: "[[David Strauss]]: the Confessor and the Writer", "On the Use and Abuse of History for Life", "Schopenhauer as Educator" and "Richard Wagner in Bayreuth". These four later appeared in a collected edition under the title ''[[Untimely Meditations]]''. The essays shared the orientation of a cultural critique, challenging the developing German culture along lines suggested by Schopenhauer and Wagner. During this time in the circle of the Wagners, he met [[Malwida von Meysenbug]] and [[Hans von Bülow]]. He also began a friendship with [[Paul Rée]], who in 1876 influenced him into dismissing the pessimism in his early writings. However, he was deeply disappointed by the [[Bayreuth Festival]] of 1876, where the banality of the shows and baseness of the public repelled him. He was also alienated by Wagner's championing of "German culture", which Nietzsche felt a contradiction in terms as well as by Wagner's celebration of his fame among the German public. All this contributed to his subsequent decision to distance himself from Wagner.

With the publication in 1878 of ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' (a book of [[aphorism]]s ranging from metaphysics to morality to religion to gender studies), a new style of Nietzsche's work became clear, highly influenced by [[Afrikan Spir]]'s ''Thought and Reality''&lt;ref&gt;Safranski, Rüdiger (trans. Shelley Frisch). ''Nietzsche: A Philosophical Biography'', p. 161. W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2003. "This work had long been consigned to oblivion, but it had a lasting impact on Nietzsche. Section 18 of ''Human, All Too Human'' cited Spir, not by name, but by presenting a 'proposition by an outstanding logician' (2,38; HH I §18)."&lt;/ref&gt; and reacting against the pessimistic philosophy of Wagner and Schopenhauer. Nietzsche's friendship with Deussen and Rohde cooled as well. In 1879, after a significant decline in health, Nietzsche had to resign his position at Basel. Since his childhood, various disruptive illnesses had plagued him, including moments of shortsightedness that left him nearly blind, [[migraine]] headaches, and violent indigestion. The 1868 riding accident and diseases in 1870 may have aggravated these persistent conditions, which continued to affect him through his years at Basel, forcing him to take longer and longer holidays until regular work became impractical.

===Independent philosopher (1879–1888)===

[[File:Nietzsche paul-ree lou-von-salome188.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Lou Andreas-Salomé|Lou Salomé]], [[Paul Rée]] and Nietzsche in 1882 as the three traveled through Italy, planning to establish an educational commune together, but the friendship disintegrated in late 1882 due to complications from Rée and Nietzsche's mutual romantic interest in Salomé]]
Living off his pension from Basel and aid from friends, Nietzsche travelled frequently to find climates more conducive to his health and lived until 1889 as an independent author in different cities. He spent many summers in [[Sils im Engadin/Segl|Sils Maria]] near [[St. Moritz]] in Switzerland. He spent his winters in the Italian cities of [[Genoa]], [[Rapallo]], and [[Turin]] and the French city of [[Nice]]. In 1881, when [[French conquest of Tunisia|France occupied Tunisia]], he planned to travel to [[Tunis]] to view Europe from the outside but later abandoned that idea, probably for health reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Stephan |last=Güntzel |url=http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=sgunzel-4 |title=Nietzsche's Geophilosophy |page=85 |journal=Journal of Nietzsche Studies |volume=25 |place=University Park (Penn State) |date=15 October 2003 |language=English, German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927184745/http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=sgunzel-4 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}; republished on HyperNietzsche.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche occasionally returned to Naumburg to visit his family, and, especially during this time, he and [[Elisabeth Forster-Nietzsche|his sister]] had repeated periods of conflict and reconciliation.

While in [[Genoa]], Nietzsche's failing eyesight prompted him to explore the use of [[typewriter]]s as a means of continuing to write. He is known to have tried using the [[Hansen Writing Ball#Sale and popular use|Hansen Writing Ball]], a contemporary typewriter device. In the end, a past student of his, [[Heinrich Köselitz]] or [[Heinrich Köselitz|Peter Gast]], became a sort of private secretary to Nietzsche. In 1876, Gast transcribed the crabbed, nearly illegible handwriting of Nietzsche for the first time with Richard Wagner in Bayreuth.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=221}} He subsequently transcribed and proofread the galleys for almost all of Nietzsche's work from then on. On at least one occasion on 23 February 1880, the usually poor Gast received 200 marks from their mutual friend, Paul Rée.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=297}} Gast was one of the very few friends Nietzsche allowed to criticize him. In responding most enthusiastically to ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', Gast did feel it necessary to point out that what were described as "superfluous" people were in fact quite necessary. He went on to list the number of people [[Epicurus]], for example, had to rely on even to supply his simple diet of goat cheese.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=415}}

To the end of his life, Gast and Overbeck remained consistently faithful friends. [[Malwida von Meysenbug]] remained like a motherly patron even outside the Wagner circle. Soon Nietzsche made contact with the music-critic [[Carl Fuchs]]. Nietzsche stood at the beginning of his most productive period. Beginning with ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' in 1878, Nietzsche published one book or major section of a book each year until 1888, his last year of writing; that year, he completed five.

In 1882, Nietzsche published the first part of ''[[The Gay Science]]''. That year he also met [[Lou Andreas-Salomé]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.f-nietzsche.de/lou_e.htm |contribution=Nietzsche and Lou Andreas-Salomé |title=F Nietzsche |place=DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; through Malwida von Meysenbug and [[Paul Rée]].

Salomé's mother took her to Rome when Salomé was 21. At a literary salon in the city, Salomé became acquainted with [[Paul Rée]]. Rée proposed marriage to her, but she instead proposed that they should live and study together as 'brother and sister', along with another man for company, where they would establish an academic commune.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=149}} Rée accepted the idea, and suggested that they be joined by his friend Nietzsche. The two met Nietzsche in Rome in April 1882, and Nietzsche is believed to have instantly fallen in love with Salome, as Rée had done.  Nietzsche asked Rée to propose marriage to Salome, which she rejected. She had been interested in Nietzsche as a friend, but not as a husband.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=149}} Nietzsche nonetheless was content to join together with Rée and Salome touring through Switzerland and Italy together, planning their commune.  The three traveled with Salomé's mother through Italy and considered where they would set up their "Winterplan" commune.   This commune was intended to be set up in an abandoned monastery, but no suitable location was found.  On 13 May, in Lucerne, when Nietzsche was alone with Salome, he earnestly proposed marriage to her again, which she rejected. He nonetheless was happy to continue with the plans for an academic commune.
.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=149}} After discovering the situation, Nietzsche's sister Elizabeth became determined to get Nietzsche away from the "immoral woman".{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=151}} 
Nietzsche and Salomé spent the summer together in [[Tautenburg]] in Thuringia, often with Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth as a chaperone. Salomé reports that he asked her to marry him on three separate occasions and that she refused, though the reliability of her reports of events has come into question.{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=49}} Arriving in [[Leipzig]], (Germany) in October, Salomé and Rée separated from Nietzsche after a falling-out between Nietzsche and Salomé, in which Salomé believed that Nietzsche was desperately in love with her.

While the three spent a number of weeks together in Leipzig in October 1882, the following month Rée and Salome ditched Nietzsche, leaving for Stibbe without any plans to meet again. Nietzsche soon fell into a period of mental anguish, although he continued to write to Rée, stating "We shall see one another from time to time, won't we?"{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=152}} In later recriminations, Nietzsche would blame on separate occasions the failure in his attempts to woo Salome both on Salome, Rée, and on the intrigues of his sister (who had written letters to the family of Salome and Rée to disrupt the plans for the commune). Nietzsche wrote of the affair in 1883, that he now felt "genuine hatred for my sister."{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=152}}

Amidst renewed bouts of illness, living in near-isolation after a falling out with his mother and sister regarding Salomé, Nietzsche fled to Rapallo, where he wrote the first part of ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' in only ten days.

[[File:Nietzsche1882.jpg|thumb|Photo of Nietzsche by {{ill|Gustav Adolf Schultze|de}}, 1882]]
By 1882, Nietzsche was taking huge doses of [[opium]], but he was still having trouble sleeping.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=389}} In 1883, while staying in Nice, he was writing out his own prescriptions for the sedative [[chloral hydrate]], signing them "Dr. Nietzsche".{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=453}}

After severing his philosophical ties with [[Schopenhauer]] (who was long dead and never met Nietzsche) and his social ties with Wagner, Nietzsche had few remaining friends. Now, with the new style of ''Zarathustra'', his work became even more alienating, and the market received it only to the degree required by politeness. Nietzsche recognized this and maintained his solitude, though he often complained about it. His books remained largely unsold. In 1885, he printed only 40 copies of the fourth part of ''Zarathustra'' and distributed only a fraction of these among close friends, including [[Helene von Druskowitz]].

In 1883, he tried and failed to obtain a lecturing post at the [[University of Leipzig]]. It was made clear to him that, in view of his attitude towards Christianity and his concept of God, he had become effectively unemployable by any German university. The subsequent "feelings of revenge and resentment" embittered him: "And hence my rage since I have grasped in the broadest possible sense what wretched means (the depreciation of my good name, my character, and my aims) ''suffice'' to take from me the trust of, and therewith the possibility of obtaining, pupils."&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich. [[s:Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche To Peter Gast – August 1883 2|Letter to Peter Gast]]. August 1883.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, Nietzsche broke with his publisher Ernst Schmeitzner, disgusted by his antisemitic opinions. Nietzsche saw his own writings as "completely buried and unexhumeable in this anti-Semitic dump" of Schmeitzner—associating the publisher with a movement that should be "utterly rejected with cold contempt by every sensible mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenietzschechannel.com/correspondence/corresp.htm#schmei |title=Correspondences |publisher=Thenietzschechannel.com |date=1 February 2000 |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then printed ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' at his own expense. He also acquired the publication rights for his earlier works and over the next year issued second editions of ''The Birth of Tragedy'', ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'', ''[[The Dawn (book)|Daybreak]]'', and ''[[The Gay Science]]'' with new prefaces placing the body of his work in a more coherent perspective. Thereafter, he saw his work as completed for a time and hoped that soon a readership would develop. In fact, interest in Nietzsche's thought did increase at this time, if rather slowly and hardly perceptibly to him. During these years Nietzsche met [[Meta von Salis]], [[Carl Spitteler]], and [[Gottfried Keller]].

In 1886, his sister Elisabeth married the [[Antisemitism|antisemite]] [[Bernhard Förster]] and travelled to Paraguay to found [[Nueva Germania]], a "Germanic" colony—a plan Nietzsche responded to with mocking laughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title= |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |edition=online |contribution=Förster-Nietzsche, Elisabeth |url=http://www.search.eb.com.librarypx.lclark.edu/eb/article-9034925 |date=10 October 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2015}} Through correspondence, Nietzsche's relationship with Elisabeth continued through cycles of conflict and reconciliation, but they met again only after his collapse. He continued to have frequent and painful attacks of illness, which made prolonged work impossible.

In 1887, Nietzsche wrote the polemic ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]''. During the same year, he encountered the work of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], to whom he felt an immediate kinship.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich. [[s:Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche To Peter Gast – March, 1887|Letter to Peter Gast]]. March 1887.&lt;/ref&gt; He also exchanged letters with [[Hippolyte Taine]] and [[Georg Brandes]]. Brandes, who had started to teach the philosophy of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] in the 1870s, wrote to Nietzsche asking him to [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche#Relation to Søren Kierkegaard|read Kierkegaard]], to which Nietzsche replied that he would come to [[Copenhagen]] and read Kierkegaard with him. However, before fulfilling this promise, he slipped too far into illness. In the beginning of 1888, Brandes delivered in Copenhagen one of the first lectures on Nietzsche's philosophy.

Although Nietzsche had previously announced at the end of ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'' a new work with the title ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]: Attempt at a [[transvaluation of values|Revaluation of All Values]]'', he eventually seems to have abandoned this idea and instead used some of the draft passages to compose ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'' and ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'' in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Mazzino |last=Montinari |title=Friedrich Nietzsche |year=1974}} translated as {{Citation |language=German |year=1991 |title=Friedrich Nietzsche. Eine Einführung |place=Berlin-New York |publisher=De Gruyter}}; and {{Citation |language=French |title=Friedrich Nietzsche |publisher=[[PUF]] |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His health seemed to improve and he spent the summer in high spirits. In the fall of 1888, his writings and letters began to reveal a higher estimation of his own status and "fate". He overestimated the increasing response to his writings, however, especially to the recent polemic, ''[[The Case of Wagner]]''. On his 44th birthday, after completing ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'' and ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'', he decided to write the autobiography ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]''. In its preface—which suggests Nietzsche was well aware of the interpretive difficulties his work would generate—he declares, "Hear me! For I am such and such a person. Above all, do not mistake me for someone else."{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888d |loc=Preface, section 1}} In December, Nietzsche began a correspondence with [[August Strindberg]] and thought that, short of an international breakthrough, he would attempt to buy back his older writings from the publisher and have them translated into other European languages. Moreover, he planned the publication of the compilation ''[[Nietzsche contra Wagner]]'' and of the poems that made up his collection ''[[Dionysian-Dithyrambs]]''.

===Psychological illness and death (1889–1900)===

[[File:NietzscheHouseTurin.jpg|thumb|left|[[Turin]] house where Nietzsche stayed (background) seen from Piazza Carlo Alberto, where he is said to have had his breakdown (at left: rear façade of [[Palazzo Carignano]])]]
On 3 January 1889, Nietzsche suffered a [[mental breakdown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Magnus|editor1-first=Bernd|editor2-last=Higgins|editor2-first=Kathleen Marie|title=The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche|date=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521367677|pages=79–81|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Xeb80itrlRIC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two policemen approached him after he caused a public disturbance in the streets of [[Turin]]. What happened remains unknown, but an often-repeated tale from shortly after his death states that Nietzsche witnessed the flogging of a horse at the other end of the Piazza Carlo Alberto, ran to the horse, threw his arms up around its neck to protect it, and then collapsed to the ground.{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=67}}&lt;ref&gt;Anacleto Verrecchia, "Nietzsche's Breakdown in Turin," in ''Nietzsche in Italy'', ed. Thomas Harrison (Stanford University: ANMA Libri, 1988) 105–12&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following few days, Nietzsche sent short writings—known as the ''Wahnzettel'' ("Madness Letters")—to a number of friends including [[Cosima Wagner]] and [[Jacob Burckhardt]]. Most of them were signed "[[Dionysos]]", though some were also signed "der Gekreuzigte" meaning "the crucified one". To his former colleague Burckhardt, Nietzsche wrote: "I have had [[Caiaphas]] put in [[fetters]]. Also, last year I was crucified by the German doctors in a very drawn-out manner. Wilhelm, [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], and all anti-Semites abolished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Simon |first=Gerald |url=http://www.thenietzschechannel.com/correspondence/ger/nilettersg.htm |publisher=The Nietzsche Channel |title=Nietzsches Briefe.

Wilhelm, Bismarck und alle Antisemiten abgeschafft."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he commanded the German emperor to go to Rome to be shot and summoned the European powers to take military action against Germany,&lt;ref&gt;[[Stefan Zweig|Zweig, Stefan]] (1939), ''Master Builders [trilogy], The Struggle with the Daimon'', Viking Press, p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt; that the pope should be put in jail and that he, Nietzsche, created the world and was in the process of having all anti-Semites shot dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenietzschechannel.com/correspondence/ger/nlett1889g.htm Nietzsches Briefe, Ausgewählte Korrespondenz, Wahnzettel 1889].&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 1889, Burckhardt showed the letter he had received from Nietzsche to Overbeck. The following day, Overbeck received a similar letter and decided that Nietzsche's friends had to bring him back to Basel. Overbeck travelled to Turin and brought Nietzsche to a psychiatric clinic in Basel. By that time Nietzsche appeared fully in the grip of a serious mental illness, and his mother Franziska decided to transfer him to a clinic in [[Jena]] under the direction of [[Otto Binswanger]]. In January 1889, they proceeded with the planned release of ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'', by that time already printed and bound. From November 1889 to February 1890, the art historian [[Julius Langbehn]] attempted to cure Nietzsche, claiming that the methods of the medical doctors were ineffective in treating Nietzsche's condition. Langbehn assumed progressively greater control of Nietzsche until his secretiveness discredited him. In March 1890, Franziska removed Nietzsche from the clinic and, in May 1890, brought him to her home in Naumburg. During this process Overbeck and Gast contemplated what to do with Nietzsche's unpublished works. In February, they ordered a fifty-copy private edition of ''[[Nietzsche contra Wagner]]'', but the publisher [[C. G. Naumann]] secretly printed one hundred. Overbeck and Gast decided to withhold publishing ''The Antichrist'' and ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' because of their more radical content. Nietzsche's reception and recognition enjoyed their first surge.{{Chronology citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In 1893, Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth returned from [[Nueva Germania]] in Paraguay following the suicide of her husband. She read and studied Nietzsche's works and, piece by piece, took control of them and their publication. Overbeck eventually suffered dismissal and Gast finally co-operated. After the death of Franziska in 1897, Nietzsche lived in [[Weimar]], where Elisabeth cared for him and allowed visitors, including [[Rudolf Steiner]] (who in 1895 had written one of the first books praising Nietzsche),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Rudolf |last=Steiner |title=Friedrich Nietzsche, ein Kämpfer gegen seine Zeit |place=Weimar |year=1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp |needed=yes|date=April 2012}} to meet her uncommunicative brother. Elisabeth at one point went so far as to employ Steiner as a tutor to help her to understand her brother's philosophy. Steiner abandoned the attempt after only a few months, declaring that it was impossible to teach her anything about philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Andrew |last=Bailey |title=First Philosophy: Fundamental Problems and Readings in Philosophy |publisher=Broadview Press |year=2002 |page=704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eh-dm-27.JPG|thumb|[[Heinrich Köselitz|Peter Gast]] "corrected" Nietzsche's writings after the breakdown without his approval]]
Nietzsche's mental illness was originally diagnosed as [[Syphilis#Tertiary|tertiary syphilis]], in accordance with a prevailing medical paradigm of the time. Although most commentators regard his breakdown as unrelated to his philosophy, [[Georges Bataille]] dropped dark hints ("'Man incarnate' must also go mad")&lt;ref&gt;Bataille, Georges (translated by Annette Michelson), "Writings on Laughter, Sacrifice, Nietzsche, Un-Knowing,"  Special issue, ''[[October (journal)|October]]'' no. 36, Spring 1986, pp. 42–45.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[René Girard]]'s postmortem psychoanalysis posits a worshipful rivalry with [[Richard Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;René Girard, "Superman in the Underground: Strategies of Madness—Nietzsche, Wagner, and Dostoevsky", ''MLN'', Vol. 91, No. 6, ''Comparative Literature''.

(Daybreak, 14) The diagnosis of syphilis has since been challenged and a diagnosis of "[[bipolar disorder|manic-depressive illness]] with periodic [[psychosis]] followed by [[vascular dementia]]" was put forward by Cybulska prior to Schain's study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cybulska |first=EM |title=The madness of Nietzsche: a misdiagnosis of the millennium? |journal=Hospital Medicine |volume=61 |issue=8 |pages=571–75 |date=August 2000 |pmid=11045229 |doi=10.12968/hosp.2000.61.8.1403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Schain |first=Richard |title=The Legend of Nietzsche's Syphilis |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-313-31940-2}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Sax]] suggested the slow growth of a right-sided retro-orbital [[meningioma]] as an explanation of Nietzsche's dementia;&lt;ref name=matthews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Sax, "What was the cause of Nietzsche's dementia?"

In 1898 and 1899, Nietzsche suffered at least two strokes. This partially paralyzed him, leaving him unable to speak or walk. He likely suffered from clinical [[hemiparesis]]/hemiplegia on the left side of his body by 1899. After contracting [[pneumonia]] in mid-August 1900, he had another stroke during the night of 24–25 August and died at about noon on 25 August.&lt;ref&gt;Concurring reports in Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche's biography (1904) and a letter by Mathilde Schenk-Nietzsche to [[Meta von Salis]], 30 August 1900, quoted in Janz (1981) p. 221.

[[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] compiled ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'' from Nietzsche's unpublished notebooks and published it posthumously. Because his sister arranged the book based on her own conflation of several of Nietzsche's early outlines and took great liberties with the material, the scholarly consensus has been that it does not reflect Nietzsche's intent. (For example, Elisabeth removed aphorism 35 of ''The Antichrist'', where Nietzsche rewrote a passage of the Bible.) Indeed, [[Mazzino Montinari]], the editor of Nietzsche's ''[[Nachlass]]'', called it a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;Montinari, Mazzino. ''The 'Will to Power' Does Not Exist''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Citizenship, nationality and ethnicity===

In Herbarz Polski, a genealogy of Polish nobility, he had come across a note about a family named 'Nicki', who could be traced back to Radwan. A member of this family named Gotard Nietzsche had left Poland for Prussia, and his descendants had eventually settled in Saxony around the year 1700.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche wrote in 1888, "My ancestors were Polish noblemen (Nietzky); the type seems to have been well preserved despite three generations of German mothers."{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=6}} At one point, Nietzsche becomes even more adamant about his Polish identity. "I am a pure-blooded Polish nobleman, without a single drop of bad blood, certainly not German blood."&lt;ref&gt;Fredrick Appel Cornell, ''Nietzsche Contra Democracy''. University Press (1998), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; On yet another occasion, Nietzsche stated, "Germany is a great nation only because its people have so much Polish blood in their veins ... I am proud of my Polish descent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Henry Louis |last=Mencken |title=The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche |origyear=1908 |publisher=University of Michigan |year=2006 |page=6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nnEOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=Nietzsche+Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche believed his name might have been [[Germanized]], in one letter claiming, "I was taught to ascribe the origin of my blood and name to Polish noblemen who were called Niëtzky and left their home and nobleness about a hundred years ago, finally yielding to unbearable suppression: they were [[Protestants]]."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Heinrich von Stein, December 1882, ''KGB'' III 1, Nr. 342, p. 287; ''KGW'' V 2, p. 579; ''KSA'' 9 p. 681&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars dispute Nietzsche's account of his family's origins. Hans von Müller debunked the genealogy put forward by Nietzsche's sister in favor of a Polish noble heritage.&lt;ref&gt;von Müller, "Nietzsches Vorfahren", reprinted ''Nietzsche-Studien'' 31 (2002): 253–75.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Oehler]], the curator of the [[Nietzsche Archive]] at [[Weimar]], argued that all of Nietzsche's ancestors bore German names, including the wives' families.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=6}} Oehler claims that Nietzsche came from a long line of German [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] clergymen on both sides of his family, and modern scholars regard the claim of Nietzsche's Polish ancestry as a "pure invention".&lt;ref name=mencken&gt;{{Citation |first=Henry Louis |last=Mencken |title=The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzche |others=introd. &amp; comm.

The name derives from the forename ''Nikolaus'', abbreviated to ''Nick''; assimilated with the Slavic ''Nitz'', it first became ''Nitsche'' and then ''Nietzsche''.{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=6}}

It is not known why Nietzsche wanted to be thought of as Polish nobility. According to biographer [[R. J. Hollingdale]], Nietzsche's propagation of the Polish ancestry myth may have been part of his "campaign against Germany".{{sfn|Hollingdale|1999|p=6}}

===Relationships and sexuality===
Nietzsche never married. He proposed to [[Lou Andreas-Salomé|Lou Salomé]] three times, but his proposal was rejected each time.&lt;ref&gt;
"Nietzsche's and Nietzsche and Lou Andreas-Salomé." Nietzsche's and Nietzsche and Lou Andreas-Salomé.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=June 2017}} There is a theory that blamed Salomé's view on sexuality as one of the reasons for her alienation from Nietzsche. As articulated in the 1898 [[novella]] ''Fenitschka'', she viewed the idea of sexual intercourse as prohibitive and marriage as a violation, with some suggesting that they indicated [[sexual repression]] and [[neurosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nietzsche's Women: Beyond the Whip|last=Diethe|first=Carol|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1996|isbn=978-3110148190|location=Berlin|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche scholar {{ill|Joachim Köhler|de|Joachim Köhler (Philosoph)}} has attempted to explain Nietzsche's life history and philosophy by claiming that Nietzsche was homosexual. Köhler argues that Nietzsche's syphilis, which is "...usually considered to be the product of his encounter with a prostitute in a brothel in [[Cologne]] or [[Leipzig]], is equally likely, it is now held, to have been contracted in a male brothel in [[Genoa]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Köhler |first=Joachim |title=Zarathustra's secret: the interior life of Friedrich Nietzsche |year=2002 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0-300-09278-3 |page=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition of the infection from a homosexual brothel was confirmed by [[Sigmund Freud]], who cited Otto Binswanger as his source.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nietzsche and Jewish Culture|last=Golomb|first=Jacob|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=978-0415095129|location=London|pages=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Köhler also suggests Nietzsche may have had a romantic relationship as well as a friendship with [[Paul Rée]].&lt;ref name="Megill" /&gt; There is the claim that Nietzsche's homosexuality is widely known in the [[Vienna Psychoanalytic Society]], with Nietzsche's friend [[Paul Deussen]] claiming that the philosopher never "touched a woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Young Nietzsche: Becoming a Genius|last=Pletsch|first=Carl|publisher=The Free Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0029250426|location=New York|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nietzsche and Rée: A Star Friendship|last=Small|first=Robin|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=2007|isbn=9780199278077|location=Oxford|pages=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Köhler's views have not found wide acceptance among Nietzsche scholars and commentators. Allan Megill argues that, while Köhler's claim that Nietzsche was in a confrontation with his homosexual desire cannot simply be dismissed, "the evidence is very weak," and Köhler may be projecting twentieth-century understandings of sexuality on nineteenth-century notions of friendship.&lt;ref name="Megill"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Allan Megill | year = 1996 | title = Historicizing Nietzsche?

{{Main|Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche}}

Because of Nietzsche's [[evocative]] style and provocative ideas, his philosophy generates passionate reactions. His works remain controversial, due to their varying interpretations and misinterpretations. In the Western philosophy tradition, Nietzsche's writings have been described as the unique case of free revolutionary thought, that is, revolutionary in its structure and problems, although not tied to any revolutionary project.&lt;ref name="Bennett2001"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Benjamin Bennett |title=Goethe As Woman: The Undoing of Literature |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AVYbszVKUO4C&amp;pg=PA184 |accessdate=3 January 2013 |year=2001 |publisher=Wayne State University Press |isbn=978-0-8143-2948-1 |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; His writings have also been described as a revolutionary project in which his philosophy serves as the foundation of a European cultural rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Friedrich Nietzsche: A Philosophical Biography|last=Young|first=Julian|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Friedrich Nietzsche: Herald of a New Era|last=Bowman|first=William|publisher=Hazar Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0997570304|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apollonian and Dionysian===
{{Main|Apollonian and Dionysian}}
The ''Apollonian and Dionysian'' is a two-fold philosophical concept, based on certain features of ancient Greek mythology: [[Apollo]] and [[Dionysus]]. Even though the concept is famously related to ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'', the poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin|Hölderlin]] had already spoken of it, and [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|Winckelmann]] had talked of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. One year before the publication of ''The Birth of Tragedy'', Nietzsche wrote a fragment titled "On Music and Words".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://nietzsche.holtof.com/Nietzsche_various/on_music_and_words_and_rhetoric.htm |title=On Music and words}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it he asserted the [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauerian]] judgment that music is a primary expression of the essence of everything. Secondarily derivative are [[Lyric poetry|lyrical poetry]] and drama, which represent mere [[Phenomenon|phenomenal]] appearances of objects. In this way, [[tragedy]] is born from music.

Nietzsche found in classical Athenian tragedy an art form that [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcended]] the pessimism found in the so-called [[Silenus#The wisdom of Silenus|wisdom of Silenus]]. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering depicted by characters on stage, passionately and joyously affirmed life, finding it worth living. A main theme in ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' was that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian ''Kunsttrieben'' ("artistic impulses") forms dramatic arts, or tragedies. He goes on to argue that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek [[tragedians]]. Apollo represents harmony, progress, clarity and logic, whereas Dionysus represents disorder, intoxication, emotion and ecstasy. Nietzsche used these two forces because, for him, the world of mind and order on one side, and passion and chaos on the other formed principles that were fundamental to the [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.historyguide.org/europe/dio_apollo.html |title=Nietzsche, Dionysus and Apollo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iP4sA3kwcFsC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=Jim+Morrison+Apollonian+and+Dionysian |title=Ideas About Art|isbn=9781444396003|author1=Desmond|first1=Kathleen K|date=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Apollonian side being a dreaming state, full of illusions; and Dionysian being the state of intoxication, representing the liberations of instinct and dissolution of boundaries. In this mold, man appears as the [[satyr]]. He is the horror of the annihilation of the principle of [[individuation|individuality]] and at the same time someone who delights in its destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.bachelorandmaster.com/creationofknowledge/apollonianism-dyonysianisism.html |title=The Apollonianism and Dionysiansism by Friedrich Nietzsche}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these principles are meant to represent [[Cognition|cognitive]] states that appear through art as the power of nature in man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.primordialtraditions.net/prime/Library/DionysusinNietzscheandGreekMyth.aspx |title=Dionysus in Nietzsche and Greek Myth |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814164705/http://www.primordialtraditions.net/prime/Library/DionysusinNietzscheandGreekMyth.aspx |archive-date=14 August 2012 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between the Apollonian and Dionysian juxtapositions is apparent, in the interplay of tragedy: the tragic hero of the drama, the main protagonist, struggles to make order (in the Apollonian sense) of his unjust and chaotic (Dionysian) fate, though he dies unfulfilled in the end. Elaborating on the conception of [[Hamlet]] as an intellectual who cannot make up his mind, and therefore is a living [[antithesis]] to the man of action, Nietzsche argues that a Dionysian figure possesses knowledge to realize that his actions cannot change the eternal balance of things, and it disgusts him enough not to be able to make any act at all. Hamlet falls under this category—he has glimpsed the supernatural reality through the Ghost, he has gained true knowledge and knows that no action of his has the power to change this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://issuu.com/mcc1289/docs/hamlet-and-nietzsche |title=Procrastination in Shakespeare's Hamlet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://geoffklock.blogspot.com/2006/11/nietzsche-on-hamlet-commonplace-book.html |title=Nietzsche on Hamlet (Commonplace Book)|date=2006-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the audience of such drama, this tragedy allows them to sense an underlying essence, what Nietzsche called the ''Primordial Unity'', which revives Dionysian nature. He describes this primordial unity as the increase of strength, experience of fullness and plenitude bestowed by [[wikt:frenzy#Noun|frenzy]]. Frenzy acts as an intoxication, and is crucial for the [[Physiology|physiological]] condition that enables making of any art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://jorbon.tripod.com/niet01.html |title=The role of art in Nietzsche's philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stimulated by this state, a person's artistic will is enhanced:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this state one enriches everything out of one's own fullness: whatever one sees, whatever wills is seen swelled, taut, strong, overloaded with strength. A man in this state transforms things until they mirror his power—until they are reflections of his perfection. This having to transform into perfection is—art.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nietzsche is adamant that the works of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] represent the apex of artistic creation, the true realization of tragedy; it is with [[Euripides]], he states, that tragedy begins its ''Untergang'' (literally "going under" or "downward-way," meaning decline, deterioration, downfall, death, etc.). Nietzsche objects to Euripides' use of [[Socratic method|Socratic rationalism]] and [[morality]] in his tragedies, claiming that the infusion of [[ethics]] and [[reason]] robs tragedy of its foundation, namely the fragile balance of the Dionysian and Apollonian. [[Socrates]] emphasized reason to such a degree that he diffused the value of [[myth]] and suffering to human knowledge. [[Plato]] continued with this path in his dialogues, and the modern world eventually inherited reason at the expense of artistic impulses that could be found only in the Apollonian and Dionysus dichotomy. This leads to his conclusion that European culture from the time of Socrates had always been only Apollonian and thus [[decadence|decadent]] and unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.carnaval.com/prophecy/ |title=Dionysus versus Apollo}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that whenever Apollonian culture dominates, the Dionysian lacks the structure to make a coherent art, and when Dionysian dominates, the Apollonian lacks the necessary passion. Only the beautiful middle, the interplay of these two forces, brought together as an art, represented real Greek tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/nietzsche/section1.html |title=The Birth of Tragedy Summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the impact of this idea can be seen in the book ''Patterns of Culture'', where [[anthropologist]] [[Ruth Benedict]] uses Nietzschean opposites of "Apollonian" and "Dionysian" as the stimulus for her thoughts about [[Native American culture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://classes.yale.edu/03-04/anth500b/projects/project_sites/02_alexy/ruthpatterns.html |first=Ruth |last=Benedict |title=Patterns of Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Jung]] has written extensively on the dichotomy in ''[[Psychological Types]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://pkdreligion.blogspot.com/2011/11/influence-of-cg-jung-on-pkd-by-frank.html |title=Influence of C.G.

Here Foucault references Nietzsche's description of the birth and death of tragedy and his explanation that the subsequent tragedy of the Western world was the refusal of the tragic and, with that, refusal of the sacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4aNoFpNfYeMC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=foucault+genealogy |title=Foucault's Nietzschean Genealogy|isbn=9780791411490|author1=Mahon|first1=Michael|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Painter [[Mark Rothko]] was influenced by Nietzsche's view of tragedy, which were presented in ''The Birth of Tragedy.''

===Perspectivism===
{{Main|Perspectivism}}

Nietzsche claimed the death of God would eventually lead to the loss of any universal perspective on things, and along with it any coherent sense of [[objective truth]].{{Sfn |Lampert |1986 |pp=17–18}}{{Sfn |Heidegger}}{{Rp |needed=yes |date=March 2012}} Nietzsche himself rejected the idea of objective reality, arguing that knowledge is [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] and conditional, relative to various fluid perspectives or interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TxlMccAak4wC&amp;q=Objective |title=Nietzsche: Naturalism and Interpretation |first=Cox |last=Cristoph|isbn=9780520921603 |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to constant reassessment of rules (i.e., those of philosophy, the scientific method, etc.) according to the circumstances of individual perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;Schacht, Richard, ''Nietzsche'', 1983, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; This view has acquired the name ''[[perspectivism]]''.

In ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', Nietzsche proclaims that a table of values hangs above every great person. He points out that what is common among different peoples is the act of esteeming, of creating values, even if the values are different from one people to the next. Nietzsche asserts that what made people great was not the content of their beliefs, but the act of valuing. Thus the values a community strives to articulate are not as important as the collective will to see those values come to pass. The willing is more essential than the intrinsic worth of the goal itself, according to Nietzsche. "A thousand goals have there been so far," says Zarathustra, "for there are a thousand peoples. Only the yoke for the thousand necks is still lacking: the one goal is lacking. Humanity still has no goal." Hence, the title of the aphorism, "On The Thousand And One Goals". The idea that one value-system is no more worthy than the next, although it may not be directly ascribed to Nietzsche, has become a common premise in modern social science. [[Max Weber]] and [[Martin Heidegger]] absorbed it and made it their own. It shaped their philosophical and cultural endeavor, as well as their political understanding. Weber, for example, relies on Nietzsche's perspectivism by maintaining that objectivity is still possible—but only after a particular perspective, value, or end has been established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.criticism.com/md/weber1.html |title=Max Weber's View of Objectivity in Social Science |first=Hoenisch |last=Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://socialsciences.scielo.org/scielo.php?pid=S1518-44712006000200006&amp;script=sci_arttext |title=Culture and perspectivism in Nietzsche's and Weber's view|journal=Teoria &amp; Sociedade|volume=2|issue=SE|pages=0|date=00/2006|last1=Nobre|first1=Renarde Freire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his critique of traditional philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Plato]] in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', Nietzsche attacked ''[[thing in itself]]'' and ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'' ("I think, therefore I am") as [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] beliefs based on naive acceptance of previous notions and [[fallacy|fallacies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.monomorphic.org/wordpress/objective-and-subjective-reality-perspectivism/ |title=Objective and subjective reality; perspectivism|date=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] puts Nietzsche in a high place in the history of philosophy. While criticizing nihilism and Nietzsche together as a sign of general decay,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3JA3vyj4slsC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=Alasdair+MacIntyre+Nietzsche+Kant |title=From Hegel to Existentialism|isbn=9780195061826|author1=Solomon|first1=Robert C|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; he still commends him for recognizing psychological motives behind Kant and [[David Hume|Hume]]'s moral philosophy:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TN7sop-yILMC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=Alasdair+MacIntyre+Nietzsche+Kant |title=Alasdair MacIntyre|isbn=9780521793810|author1=Murphy|first1=Mark C|date=23 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For it was Nietzsche's historic achievement to understand more clearly than any other philosopher...not only that what purported to be appeals of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] were in fact expressions of subjective will, but also the nature of the problems that this posed for philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z9RaG9ccs44C&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=Alasdair+MacIntyre+Nietzsche+Kant |title=Tradition in the ethics of Alasdair MacIntyre|isbn=9780739141489|author1=Lutz|first1=Christopher Stephen|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The "slave revolt" in morals===
{{Main|Master–slave morality}}
{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--4 paragraphs have no citations--&gt;
In ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' and ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'', Nietzsche's [[Genealogy (philosophy)|genealogical]] account of the development of modern moral systems occupies a central place. For Nietzsche, a fundamental shift took place during human history from thinking in terms of ''good and bad'' toward ''good and evil''.

The initial form of morality was set by a warrior [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] and other ruling castes of ancient civilizations. Aristocratic values of good and bad coincided with and reflected their relationship to lower [[caste]]s such as slaves. Nietzsche presents this "master morality" as the original system of morality—perhaps best associated with [[Homer]]ic Greece. To be "good" was to be happy and to have the things related to happiness: wealth, strength, health, power, etc. To be "bad" was to be like the slaves the aristocracy ruled over: poor, weak, sick, pathetic—an object of pity or disgust rather than hatred.

"Slave morality" comes about as a reaction to master-morality. Here, value emerges from the contrast between good and evil: good being associated with other-worldliness, charity, piety, restraint, meekness, and submission; and evil seen as worldly, cruel, selfish, wealthy, and aggressive. Nietzsche sees slave morality as pessimistic and fearful, values for them serving only to ease the existence for those who suffer from the very same thing. He associates slave-morality with the Jewish and Christian traditions, in a way that slave-morality is born out of the [[ressentiment]] of slaves. Nietzsche argued that the idea of equality allowed slaves to overcome their own condition without hating themselves. And by denying the inherent inequality of people (such as success, strength, beauty or intelligence), slaves acquired a method of escape, namely by generating new values on the basis of rejecting something that was seen as a perceived source of frustration. It was used to overcome the slave's own sense of inferiority before the (better-off) masters. It does so by making out slave weakness to be a matter of choice, by, e.g., relabeling it as "meekness". The "good man" of master morality is precisely the "evil man" of slave morality, while the "bad man" is recast as the "good man".

Nietzsche sees the slave-morality as a source of the nihilism that has overtaken Europe. Modern Europe and Christianity exist in a hypocritical state due to a tension between master and slave morality, both values contradictorily determining, to varying degrees, the values of most Europeans (who are "[[motley]]"). Nietzsche calls for exceptional people to no longer be ashamed of their uniqueness in the face of a supposed morality-for-all, which he deems to be harmful to the flourishing of exceptional people. He cautions, however, that morality, per se, is not bad; it is good for the masses, and should be left to them. Exceptional people, on the other hand, should follow their own "inner law". A favorite motto of Nietzsche, taken from [[Pindar]], reads: "Become what you are."

A long standing assumption about Nietzsche is that he preferred master over slave morality. However, the Nietzsche scholar [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] rejected this interpretation, writing that Nietzsche's analyses of these two types of morality were only used in a [[descriptive ethics|descriptive]] and historic sense, they were not meant for any kind of acceptance or glorifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=wvKRUSdUsnkC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=Master+slave+morality |title=From Shakespeare to existentialism|isbn=978-0691013671|author1=Kaufmann|first1=Walter Arnold|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it is clear from his own writings that Nietzsche wanted the victory of master morality. He linked the "salvation and future of the human race with the unconditional dominance"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Genealogy of Morals|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|publisher=|year=1887|isbn=|location=|pages=First essay, section 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; of master morality and called master morality "a higher order of values, the noble ones, those that say Yes to life, those that guarantee the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecce Homo|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|publisher=|year=1908|isbn=|location=|pages=Chapter on The Case of Wagner, section 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as "there is an order of rank between man and man," there is also an order of rank "between morality and morality."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Good and Evil|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|publisher=|year=1886|isbn=|location=|pages=Section 228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Nietzsche waged a philosophic war against the slave morality of Christianity in his "revaluation of all values" in order to bring about the victory of a new master morality that he called the "philosophy of the future" (''Beyond Good and Evil'' is subtitled ''Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Friedrich Nietzsche: Herald of a New Era|last=Bowman|first=William|publisher=Hazar Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0997570304|location=|pages=31–38, 60–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Dawn (book)|Daybreak]]'', Nietzsche begins his "Campaign against Morality".{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=187}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888d |loc=M I}} He calls himself an "immoralist" and harshly criticizes the prominent moral philosophies of his day: Christianity, [[Kantianism]], and [[utilitarianism]]. Nietzsche's concept "[[God is dead]]" applies to the doctrines of Christendom, though not to all other faiths: he claimed that [[Buddhism]] is a successful religion that he compliments for fostering critical thought.{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=26}} Still, Nietzsche saw his philosophy as a counter-movement to nihilism through appreciation of art:

{{quote|text=Art as the single superior counterforce against all will to negation of life, art as the anti-Christian, anti-Buddhist, anti-Nihilist par excellence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://jorbon.tripod.com/niet01.html |title=Art in Nietzsche's philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nietzsche claimed that the Christian faith as practised was not a proper representation of Jesus' teachings, as it forced people merely to believe in the way of Jesus but not to act as Jesus did, in particular his example of refusing to judge people, something that Christians had constantly done the opposite of.{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=26}} He condemned institutionalized Christianity for emphasizing a morality of [[pity]] (''Mitleid''), which assumes an inherent illness in society:{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=27}}
{{quote|text=Christianity is called the religion of ''pity''. Pity stands opposed to the tonic emotions which heighten our vitality: it has a depressing effect. We are deprived of strength when we feel pity. That loss of strength which suffering as such inflicts on life is still further increased and multiplied by pity. Pity makes suffering contagious.&lt;ref&gt;''The Antichrist'', section 7. transl. Walter Kaufmann, in ''The Portable Nietzsche'', 1977, pp. 572–73.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' Nietzsche called the establishment of moral systems based on a dichotomy of [[good and evil]] a "calamitous error",{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888d |loc=Why I Am a Destiny, §3}} and wished to initiate a [[transvaluation of values|re-evaluation]] of the [[Value (ethics)|values]] of the Judeo-Christian world.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888c |pp=4, 8, 18, 29, 37, 40, 51, 57, 59}} He indicates his desire to bring about a new, more naturalistic source of value in the vital impulses of life itself.

While Nietzsche attacked the principles of [[Judaism]], he was not [[antisemitic]]: in his work ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'', he explicitly condemns antisemitism, and points out that his attack on Judaism was not an attack on contemporary Jewish people but specifically an attack upon the ancient Jewish priesthood whom he claims [[antisemitic Christians]] paradoxically based their views upon.{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=69}} An Israeli historian who performed a statistical analysis of everything Nietzsche wrote about Jews claims that cross references and context make clear that almost all (85%) negative comments are actually attacks on Christian doctrine or, sarcastically, on Richard Wagner.&lt;ref&gt;Zev Golan, "Nietzsche: Anti- or Philo-Semite? An Examination of His Books," in ''God, Man and Nietzsche'', iUniverse, 2008 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche felt that modern antisemitism was "despicable" and against European ideals.{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=68}} Its cause, in his opinion, was the growth in European nationalism and the endemic "jealousy and hatred" of Jewish success.{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=68}} He wrote that Jews should be thanked for helping uphold a respect for the philosophies of ancient Greece,{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=68}} and for giving rise to "the noblest human being (Christ), the purest philosopher ([[Baruch Spinoza]]), the mightiest book, and the most effective moral code in the world."&lt;ref name=nebraska&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm. ''Human, All Too Human: A Book for Free Spirits'', Univ. of Nebraska Press (1986) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of God and nihilism===
{{Main|God is dead|Nihilism}}
The statement "[[God is dead]]", occurring in several of Nietzsche's works (notably in ''[[The Gay Science]]''), has become one of his best-known remarks. On the basis of it, most commentators&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Morgan |first=George Allen |title=What Nietzsche Means |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |location=Cambridge, MA |year=1941 |page=36 |isbn=978-0-8371-7404-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; regard Nietzsche as an [[atheism|atheist]]; others (such as Kaufmann) suggest that this statement reflects a more subtle understanding of divinity. Recent developments in modern science and the increasing [[secularization]] of European society had effectively 'killed' the [[Abrahamic]] God, who had served as the basis for meaning and value in the West for more than a thousand years. The death of God may lead beyond bare perspectivism to outright [[nihilism]], the belief that nothing has any inherent importance and that life lacks purpose. Here he states that the Christian moral doctrine provides people with [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]], belief in God (which [[Theodicy|justifies]] the evil in the world) and a basis for [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective knowledge]]. In this sense, in constructing a world where objective knowledge is possible, Christianity is an antidote to a primal form of nihilism—the despair of meaninglessness. As [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] put the problem, "If God as the suprasensory ground and goal of all reality is dead, if the suprasensory world of the ideas has suffered the loss of its obligatory and above it its vitalizing and upbuilding power, then nothing more remains to which man can cling and by which he can orient himself."{{Sfn |Heidegger |p=61}}

One such reaction to the loss of meaning is what Nietzsche calls ''passive nihilism'', which he recognises in the [[pessimism|pessimistic]] philosophy of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]. Schopenhauer's doctrine—which Nietzsche also refers to as [[Buddhism in the West#Philosophical interest|Western Buddhism]]—advocates separating oneself from will and desires in order to reduce suffering. Nietzsche characterises this [[Asceticism|ascetic]] attitude as a "will to nothingness", whereby life turns away from itself, as there is nothing of value to be found in the world. This moving away of all value in the world is characteristic of the nihilist, although in this, the nihilist appears to be inconsistent:&lt;ref&gt;This "will to nothingness" is still a willing of some sort, because it is exactly ''as'' a pessimist that Schopenhauer clings to life. See F. Nietzsche, ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'', III:7&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A nihilist is a man who judges that the real world ought ''not'' to be, and that the world as it ought to be does not exist. According to this view, our existence (action, [[suffering]], willing, feeling) has no meaning: this 'in vain' is the nihilists' pathos—an inconsistency on the part of the nihilists.|Friedrich Nietzsche, KSA 12:9 [60]|taken from ''The Will to Power'', section 585, translated by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]}}

Nietzsche approaches the problem of nihilism as a deeply personal one, stating that this problem of the modern world is a problem that has "become conscious" in him.&lt;ref&gt;F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:7 [8]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he emphasizes both the danger of nihilism and the possibilities it offers, as seen in his statement that "I praise, I do not reproach, [nihilism's] arrival. I believe it is one of the greatest crises, a moment of the deepest self-reflection of humanity. Whether man recovers from it, whether he becomes master of this crisis, is a question of his strength!"&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche, Complete Works Vol. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nietzsche, it is only when nihilism is ''overcome'' that a culture can have a true foundation on which to thrive. He wished to hasten its coming only so that he could also hasten its ultimate departure. Heidegger interprets the death of God with what he explains as the death of [[metaphysics]]. He concludes that metaphysics has reached its potential and that the ultimate fate and downfall of metaphysics was proclaimed with the statement "God is dead".

===Will to power===
{{Main|Will to power}}
A basic element in Nietzsche's philosophical outlook is the "[[will to power]]" (''der Wille zur Macht''), which he maintained provides a basis for understanding human behavior—more so than competing explanations, such as the ones based on pressure for adaptation or survival.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |p=13}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1882 |p=349}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1887 |p=II:12}} As such, according to Nietzsche, the drive for conservation appears as the major motivator of human or animal behavior only in exceptions, as the general condition of life is not one of emergency, of 'struggle for existence'.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888b |loc=Skirmishes of an untimely man, §14}} More often than not, self-conservation is but a consequence of a creature's will to exert its strength on the outside world.

In presenting his theory of human behavior, Nietzsche also addressed, and attacked, concepts from philosophies popularly embraced in his days, such as Schopenhauer's notion of an aimless will or that of [[utilitarianism]]. Utilitarians claim that what moves people is mainly the desire to be happy, to accumulate pleasure in their lives. But such a conception of happiness Nietzsche rejected as something limited to, and characteristic of, the bourgeois lifestyle of the English society,&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Leiter]], ''Routledge guide to Nietzsche on morality'', p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; and instead put forth the idea that happiness is not an aim ''per se''—it is instead a consequence of a successful pursuit of one's aims, of the overcoming of hurdles to one's actions—in other words, of the fulfillment of the will.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888c |loc=§2}}

Related to his theory of the will to power is his speculation, which he did not deem final,{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, §36}} regarding the reality of the physical world, including inorganic matter—that, like man's affections and impulses, the material world is also set by the dynamics of a form of the will to power. At the core of his theory is a rejection of [[atomism]]—the idea that matter is composed of stable, indivisible units (atoms). Instead, he seems to have accepted the conclusions of [[Ruđer Bošković]], who explained the qualities of matter as a result of an interplay of forces.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche comments in many notes about matter being a hypothesis drawn from the metaphysics of substance: G. Whitlock, "Roger Boscovich, Benedict de Spinoza and Friedrich Nietzsche: The Untold Story", ''Nietzsche-Studien'' 25, 1996, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, §12}} One study of Nietzsche defines his fully developed concept of the will to power as "the element from which derive both the quantitative difference of related forces and the quality that devolves into each force in this relation" revealing the will to power as "the principle of the synthesis of forces."{{Sfn |Deleuze |2006 |p=46}} Of such forces Nietzsche said they could perhaps be viewed as a primitive form of the will. Likewise he rejected as a mere interpretation the view that the movement of bodies is ruled by inexorable laws of nature, positing instead that movement was governed by the power relations between bodies and forces.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, §22}} Other scholars disagree that Nietzsche considered the material world to be a form of the will to power: Nietzsche thoroughly criticized metaphysics, and by including the will to power in the material world, he would simply be setting up a new metaphysics. Other than aphorism 36 in ''Beyond Good and Evil'', where he raised a question regarding will to power as being in the material world, it was only in his notes (unpublished by himself), where he wrote about a metaphysical will to power. Nietzsche directed his landlord to burn those notes in 1888 when he left Sils Maria for the last time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nie/summary/v031/31.1leddy.html |title=Project MUSE – Nietzsche's Mirror: The World as Will to Power (review) |journal=The Journal of Nietzsche Studies |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=66–68 |doi=10.1353/nie.2006.0006 |accessdate=22 August 2014|date=2006-06-14 |last1=Leddy |first1=Thomas }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eternal return===
{{Main|Eternal return}}

"Eternal return" (also known as "eternal recurrence") is a hypothetical concept that posits that the universe has been recurring, and will continue to recur, in a self-similar form for an infinite number of times across infinite time or space. It is a purely [[physics|physical]] concept, involving no supernatural [[reincarnation]], but the return of beings in the same bodies. Nietzsche first invokes the idea of eternal return in a parable in Section 341 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'', and also in the chapter "Of the Vision and the Riddle" in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', among other places.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1961 |pp=176–80}} Nietzsche contemplates the idea as potentially "horrifying and paralyzing," and says that its burden is the "heaviest weight" imaginable ("''das schwerste Gewicht''").&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kundera |first=Milan |title=The Unbearable Lightness of Being |year=1999 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wish for the eternal return of all events would mark the ultimate affirmation of life, a reaction to [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s praise of denying the will‐to‐live. To comprehend eternal recurrence in his thought, and to not merely come to peace with it but to embrace it, requires ''[[amor fati]]'', "love of fate".&lt;ref name=dudl&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dudley |first=Will |title=Hegel, Nietzsche, and Philosophy: Thinking Freedom |year=2002 |page=201 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4dLeWFK6qp0C&amp;pg=PA201|isbn=9780521812504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Heidegger]] points out in his lectures on Nietzsche, Nietzsche's first mention of eternal recurrence presents this concept as a [[Thought experiment|hypothetical ''question'']] rather than postulating it as a fact.  According to Heidegger, it is the burden imposed by the ''question'' of eternal recurrence—whether or not such a thing could possibly be true—that is so significant in modern thought: "The way Nietzsche here patterns the first communication of the thought of the 'greatest burden' [of eternal recurrence] makes it clear that this 'thought of thoughts' is at the same time 'the most burdensome thought.'"&lt;ref&gt;See Heidegger, ''Nietzsche. Volume II: The Eternal Recurrence of the Same'' trans. [[David Farrell Krell]]. New York: Harper and Row, 1984. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only does Nietzsche posit that the universe is recurring over infinite time and space, but that the different versions of events that have occurred in the past may at one point or another take place again, hence "all configurations that have previously existed on this earth must yet meet..."&lt;ref name="Vintage Books"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kaufmann |first=Friedrich Nietzsche. Transl., with comm., by Walter |title=The Gay Science with a Prelude in Rhymes and an Appendix of Songs |date=1974 |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0394719856 |page=16 |edition=[1st ed.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; And with each version of events is hoping that some knowledge or awareness is gained to better the individual, hence "And thus it will happen one day that a man will be born again, just like me and a woman will be born, just like Mary—only that it is hoped to be that the head of this man may contain a little less foolishness..."&lt;ref name="Vintage Books"/&gt;

[[Alexander Nehamas]] writes in ''Nietzsche: Life as Literature'' of three ways of seeing the eternal recurrence: "(A) My life will recur in exactly identical fashion." This expresses a totally fatalistic approach to the idea. "(B) My life may recur in exactly identical fashion." This second view conditionally asserts [[cosmology]], but fails to capture what Nietzsche refers to in ''The Gay Science'', 341. Finally, "(C) If my life were to recur, then it could recur only in identical fashion." Nehamas shows that this interpretation exists totally independently of physics and does not presuppose the truth of cosmology. Nehamas draws the conclusion that if individuals constitute themselves through their actions, then they can only maintain themselves in their current state by living in a recurrence of past actions (Nehamas 153). Nietzsche's thought is the negation of the idea of a history of salvation.&lt;ref name="Tongeren2000"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Paul Van Tongeren |title=Reinterpreting Modern Culture: An Introduction to Friedrich Nietzsche's Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TqxrlA9Qxg0C&amp;pg=PA295 |accessdate=18 April 2013 |year=2000 |publisher=Purdue University Press |isbn=978-1-55753-157-5 |page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Übermensch===
{{Main|Übermensch}}

Another concept important to an understanding of Nietzsche's thought is the ''Übermensch''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |title=The Portable Nietzsche |others=trans. Walter Kaufmann |location=New York |publisher=Penguin |year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |others=ed.

Zarathustra's gift of the overman is given to a mankind not aware of the problem to which the overman is the solution."{{Sfn |Lampert |1986 |p=18}} Zarathustra presents the overman as the creator of new values, and he appears as a solution to the problem of the death of God and nihilism. The overman does not follow morality of common people since that favors mediocrity but instead rises above the notion of [[good and evil]] and above the "[[Herd behavior|herd]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-nietzsche.html |title=Philosophy 302: Ethics Nietzsche, "Slave and Master Morality"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way Zarathustra proclaims his ultimate goal as the journey towards the state of overman. He wants a kind of spiritual evolution of self-awareness and overcoming of traditional views on morality and justice that stem from the [[superstition]] beliefs still deeply rooted or related to the notion of God and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.gradesaver.com/thus-spoke-zarathustra/study-guide/major-themes/ |title=Thus Spoke Zarathustra themes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=July 2018}}

While interpretations of Nietzsche's overman vary wildly, here is one of his quotations from ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' (Prologue, §§3–4):

{{quote|text=I teach you the overman. Man is something that shall be overcome. What have you done to overcome him?... All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood, and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is ape to man? A laughing stock or painful embarrassment. And man shall be that to overman: a laughing stock or painful embarrassment. You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm. Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape... The overman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: the overman shall be the meaning of the earth... Man is a rope, tied between beast and overman—a rope over an abyss ... what is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end.}}

Zarathustra contrasts the overman with the [[last man]] of egalitarian modernity (most obvious example being democracy), an alternative goal humanity might set for itself. The last man is possible only by mankind's having bred an [[Apathy|apathetic]] creature who has no great passion or commitment, who is unable to dream, who merely earns his living and keeps warm. This concept appears only in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', and is presented as a condition that would render the creation of the overman impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.nietzschespirit.com/files/The_Most_Despicable_Man_is_Coming...the_Last_Man.html |title=Nietzsche and Heidegger |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607060856/http://www.nietzschespirit.com/files/The_Most_Despicable_Man_is_Coming...the_Last_Man.html |archivedate=7 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have suggested that the notion of eternal return is related to the overman, since willing the eternal return of the same is a necessary step if the overman is to create new values, untainted by the spirit of gravity or [[asceticism]]. Values involve a rank-ordering of things, and so are inseparable from approval and disapproval; yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values. It could seem that the overman, in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism. Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognizing it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism. One must have the strength of the overman in order to will the eternal recurrence; that is, only the overman will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really are sick, not because of any choice they made.

The Nazis tried to incorporate the concept into their ideology. After his death, [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] became the curator and editor of her brother's manuscripts. She reworked Nietzsche's unpublished writings to fit her own [[German nationalism#1871 to World War I, 1914–1918|German nationalist]] ideology while often contradicting or obfuscating Nietzsche's stated opinions, which were explicitly [[philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche's criticism of anti-Semitism and nationalism|opposed to antisemitism and nationalism]]. Through her published editions, Nietzsche's work became associated with [[fascism]] and [[Nazism]];&lt;ref name="Golomb 2002"/&gt; 20th century scholars contested this interpretation of his work and corrected editions of his writings were soon made available.

Although Nietzsche has famously been misrepresented as a predecessor to Nazism, he criticized anti-Semitism, [[pan-Germanism]] and, to a lesser extent, [[nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Keith Ansell-Pearson, ''An Introduction to Nietzsche as Political Thinker: The Perfect Nihilist,'' Cambridge University Press, 1994, pp 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he broke with his editor in 1886 because of his opposition to his editor's anti-Semitic stances, and his rupture with [[Richard Wagner]], expressed in ''[[The Case of Wagner]]'' and ''[[Nietzsche contra Wagner]],'' both of which he wrote in 1888, had much to do with Wagner's endorsement of pan-Germanism and anti-Semitism — and also of his rallying to Christianity. In a March 29, 1887 letter to [[Theodor Fritsch]], Nietzsche mocked anti-Semites, Fritsch, [[Eugen Dühring]], Wagner, Ebrard&lt;!-- is it [[Johannes Heinrich August Ebrard]] ? --&gt;, [[Adolf Wahrmund|Wahrmund]], and the leading advocate of pan-Germanism, [[Paul de Lagarde]], who would become, along with Wagner and [[Houston Chamberlain]], the main official influences of [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name=Bataille/&gt; This 1887 letter to Fritsch ended by: "And finally, how do you think I feel when the name Zarathustra is mouthed by anti-Semites?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20150815060910/http://www.geocities.com/thenietzschechannel/nlett1887.htm March 29, 1887 letter] to [[Theodor Fritsch]] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critique of mass culture===
Friedrich Nietzsche held a pessimistic view on modern society and culture. His views stand against the concept of popular culture. He believed the press and mass culture led to conformity and brought about mediocrity. Nietzsche saw a lack of intellectual progress, leading to the decline of the human species. According to Nietzsche, individuals needed to overcome this form of mass culture. He believed some people were able to become superior individuals through the use of will power. By rising above mass culture, society would produce higher, brighter and healthier human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kellner |first=Douglas |title=Nietzsche's Critique of Mass Culture |journal=International Studies in Philosophy |year=1999 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=77–89 |doi=10.5840/intstudphil199931353 |url=http://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=intstudphil&amp;id=intstudphil_1999_0031_0003_0077_0089&amp;onlyautologin=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reading and influence==
[[File:Nietzsche Archives in Weimar.jpg|thumb|The residence of Nietzsche's last three years along with archive in [[Weimar]], Germany, which holds many of Nietzsche's papers]]
{{Main|Library of Friedrich Nietzsche}}
A trained philologist, Nietzsche had a thorough knowledge of [[Greek philosophy]]. He read [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Plato]], [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Afrikan Spir|Spir]],&lt;ref&gt;Brobjer, Thomas. "Nietzsche's Reading and Private Library, 1885–1889." Published in ''Journal of History of Ideas.''&lt;/ref&gt; who became his main opponents in his philosophy, and later [[Baruch Spinoza]], whom he saw as his "precursor" in many respects&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Franz Overbeck, 30 July 1881&lt;/ref&gt; but as a personification of the "ascetic ideal" in others. However, Nietzsche referred to Kant as a "moral fanatic", Plato as "boring", Mill as a "blockhead", and of Spinoza he said: "How much of personal timidity and vulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray?"{{Sfn|Russell|2004|pp=693–97}} He likewise expressed contempt for British author [[George Eliot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thomas J. |last=Joudrey |title=The Defects of Perfectionism: Nietzsche, Eliot, and the Irrevocability of Wrong |journal=[[Philological Quarterly]] |number=96.1 |year=2017 |pages=77–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche's philosophy, while innovative and revolutionary, was indebted to many predecessors. While at Basel, Nietzsche offered lecture courses on pre-Platonic philosophers for several years, and the text of this lecture series has been characterized as a "lost link" in the development of his thought. "In it concepts such as the will to power, the eternal return of the same, the overman, gay science, self-overcoming and so on receive rough, unnamed formulations and are linked to specific pre-Platonics, especially Heraclitus, who emerges as a pre-Platonic Nietzsche."{{Sfn|Nietzsche|2001|p=xxxvii}} The [[pre-Socratic]] thinker [[Heraclitus]] was known for the rejection of the concept of [[being]] as a constant and eternal principle of universe, and his embrace of "flux" and incessant change. His symbolism of the world as "child play" marked by amoral spontaneity and lack of definite rules was appreciated by Nietzsche.{{Sfn|Roochnik|2004|pp=37–39}} From his Heraclitean sympathy, Nietzsche was also a vociferous detractor of [[Parmenides]], who opposed Heraclitus and believed all world is a single Being with no change at all.{{Sfn|Roochnik|2004|p=48}}

In his ''Egotism in German Philosophy'', [[George Santayana|Santayana]] claimed that Nietzsche's whole philosophy was a reaction to Schopenhauer. Santayana wrote that Nietzsche's work was "an emendation of that of Schopenhauer. The will to live would become the will to dominate; pessimism founded on reflection would become optimism founded on courage; the suspense of the will in contemplation would yield to a more biological account of intelligence and taste; finally in the place of pity and asceticism (Schopenhauer's two principles of morals) Nietzsche would set up the duty of asserting the will at all costs and being cruelly but beautifully strong. These points of difference from Schopenhauer cover the whole philosophy of Nietzsche."{{Sfn|Santayana|1916|p=114}}

Nietzsche expressed admiration for 17th-century French moralists such as [[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|La Rochefoucauld]], [[Jean de La Bruyère|La Bruyère]] and [[Luc de Clapiers, marquis de Vauvenargues|Vauvenargues]],&lt;ref&gt;Brendan Donnellan, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/404869 "Nietzsche and La Rochefoucauld"] in ''[[The German Quarterly]]'', Vol. 52, No. 3 (May 1979), pp. 303–18&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for [[Stendhal]].{{Sfn|Nietzsche|1888d|loc="Why I am So Clever", §3}} The [[organicism]] of [[Paul Bourget]] influenced Nietzsche,&lt;ref&gt;Johan Grzelczyk, [http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=jgrzelczyk-4 "Féré et Nietzsche: au sujet de la décadence"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116213847/http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=jgrzelczyk-4 |date=16 November 2006 }}, ''HyperNietzsche'', 1 November 2005 {{fr icon}}.

Nietzsche's works did not reach a wide readership during his active writing career. However, in 1888 the influential Danish critic [[Georg Brandes]] aroused considerable excitement about Nietzsche through a series of lectures he gave at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. In the years after Nietzsche's death in 1900, his works became better known, and readers have responded to them in complex and sometimes controversial ways.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri19chisrich#page/672/mode/1up 1910 article from the Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; Many Germans eventually discovered his appeals for greater [[individualism]] and personality development in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', but responded to them divergently. He had some following among left-wing Germans in the 1890s; in 1894–1895 German conservatives wanted to ban his work as [[subversive]]. During the late 19th century [[Anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's ideas were commonly associated with anarchist movements]] and appear to have had influence within them, particularly in France and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;O.

Nietzsche's growing prominence suffered a severe setback when his works became closely associated with [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Nazi Germany]]. Many political leaders of the twentieth century were at least superficially familiar with Nietzsche's ideas, although it is not always possible to determine whether they actually read his work. It is debated among scholars whether Hitler read Nietzsche, although if he did his reading of him may not have been extensive.&lt;ref&gt;"We know, from his [Hitler's] secretary, that he could quote Schopenhauer by the page, and the other German philosopher of willpower, Nietzsche, whose works he afterwards presented to [[Mussolini]], was often on his lips." [[Hugh Trevor-Roper|Trevor Roper, H.]] ''[[The Mind of Adolf Hitler]]'', p. xxxvii. Introductory essay for ''Hitler's Table Talk 1941–1944 Secret Conversations''. Enigma Books (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"'Landsberg,' Hitler told [[Hans Frank]], was his 'university paid for by the state.' He read, he said, everything he could get hold of: Nietzsche, [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], [[Leopold von Ranke|Ranke]], [[Heinrich von Treitschke|Treitschke]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]'s Thoughts and Memories, and the war memoirs of German and allied generals and statesmen....But Hitler's reading and reflection were anything but academic, doubtless he did read much. However, as was noted in an earlier chapter, he made clear in [[Mein Kampf|My Struggle]] that reading for him had purely an instrumental purpose. He read not for knowledge or enlightenment, but for confirmation of his own preconceptions." Kershaw, Ian Hitler: ''Hubris 1889–1936''.

A decade after World War II, there was a revival of Nietzsche's philosophical writings thanks to exhaustive translations and analyses by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] and [[R. J. Hollingdale]]. Others, well known philosophers in their own right, wrote commentaries on Nietzsche's philosophy, including [[Martin Heidegger]], who produced a four-volume study, and [[Lev Shestov]], who wrote a book called ''Dostoyevski, Tolstoy and Nietzsche'' where he portrays Nietzsche and Dostoyevski as the "thinkers of tragedy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Nietzsche |first=Shestov |last=Lev|isbn=978-0821400531}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Simmel]] compares Nietzsche's importance to ethics to that of [[Copernicus]] for [[cosmology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.philosophynow.org/issues/29/Nietzsche_and_Germany |title=Nietzsche &amp; Germany |first=Sorgner |last=Stefan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] read Nietzsche avidly from his early life, and later frequently discussed many of his concepts in his own works.

The '''Green Room Club''' was a New York fraternal organization founded in December 20, 1902, for men involved in the dramatic arts.  Its members included actors, managers, singers, composers, librettists, dramatists, other members of the theatrical profession, journalists, and lay members. Its purpose was to bring actors and managers into close personal relations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/stageyearbo1909londuoft/stageyearbo1909londuoft_djvu.txt ''The Stage Year Book'' (1909)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Library ==
By 1908, the club claimed that its library held the most complete collection of dramatic materials in the country and had a goal of building it into the most complete in the world.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Room Club Dress Rehearsal,'' [[New York Times]], April 26, 1907&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Klaw &amp; Erlanger]] Aid Library,'' New York Times, February 14, 1908&lt;/ref&gt;  Aubrey Boucicault (son of [[Dion Boucicault]] and brother of [[Nina Boucicault]]) was the chairman of the library committee in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2010/New%20York%20NY%20Dramatic%20Mirror/New%20York%20NY%20Dramatic%20Mirror%201906%20May-Apr%201907%20Grayscale/New%20York%20NY%20Dramatic%20Mirror%201906%20May-Apr%201907%20Grayscale%20-%200184.pdf ''Green Room Club Library,'' New York Dramatic Mirror, June 23, 1906, pg. 8]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Club founding == 
The Green Room Club was founded in 1902.  Those signing the articles of incorporation were by [[William A. Brady]], Milton Nobles, [[Thomas McGrath (poet)|Thomas McGrath]], Walter Fessler, [[Frank Findley Mackay|F.F. MacKay]], and Charles Dickson.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2qEgAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA350&amp;dq ''The Green Room Club,'' The Green Book Album (magazine), Volume 2, July 1909, pg. 350]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of its founding members had been former members of the Actors Order of Friendship.  They founded the Green Room with the aim of attracting younger actors.  But later, the club became the primary social organization for managers and producers of theater, whose members included [[David Belasco]] and [[Daniel Frohman]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BNvz3mjz4YwC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq Joey A. Condon, ''An Examination Into the History and Present Interrelationship Between the Church and the Theater'' (masters thesis), University of Missouri—Kansas City (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Club dissolution ==
The Green Room Club disbanded on November 11, 1928, under financial duress.  Among other things, the organization was in arrears on rent for its clubhouse located at 19 West 48th Street.  Its landlord was [[Columbia University]], which, at the time, was located in that area.

'''The Ink Flag''' ({{lang-he-n|דֶּגֶל הַדְּיוֹ}}, ''Degel HaDyo'') was a handmade [[Flag of Israel|Israeli flag]] raised during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] to mark the capture of [[Eilat|Umm Rashrash]].

==History==
On March 5, 1949, Israel launched [[Operation Uvda]], the last military maneuver of the war. On March 10, the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] reached the shores of the [[Red Sea]] at Umm Rashrash, west of [[Aqaba]] in the area of biblical Elath, and captured it without a battle. The [[Negev Brigade]] and [[Golani Brigade]] took part in the operation. A makeshift flag created from a white sheet inscribed with ink was raised by [[Avraham Adan]], company commander of the 8th Battalion of the Negev Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/general-avraham-adan-soldier-who-raised-the-ink-flag-that-signalled-the-birth-of-israel-8198453.html General Avraham Adan: Soldier who raised the 'Ink Flag' that signaled the birth of Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

The improvised flag was made on the order of Negev Brigade commander Nahum Sarig, when it was discovered that the brigade did not have an [[Flag of Israel|Israeli flag]] on hand. The soldiers found a sheet, drew two ink stripes, and sewed on a [[Star of David]] torn off a first-aid kit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://israelity.com/2011/08/21/nostalgia-sunday-eilat/ Nostalgia Sunday – Eilat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203083942/http://israelity.com/2011/08/21/nostalgia-sunday-eilat/ |date=2013-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Eilat, a bronze sculpture by Israeli sculptor [[Bernard Reder]] commemorates the event.&lt;ref name="Bernard Reder sculpture"&gt;[http://www.jposttravel.com/center_tours/telaviv.html?x=27&amp;y=13 Bernard Reder sculpture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713122214/http://www.jposttravel.com/center_tours/telaviv.html?x=27&amp;y=13 |date=2011-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The photo of the raising of the Ink Flag, taken by the soldier Micha Perry, bears resemblance to the ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/former-idf-general-israeli-icon-avraham-adan-dies-at-86-1.467408 Former IDF general, Israeli icon Avraham Adan, dies at 86, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

October 28, the '''International Animation Day''' (IAD) was proclaimed in 2002 by the [[ASIFA]] as the main global event to celebrate the art of [[animation]].

This day commemorates the first public performance of [[Charles-Émile Reynaud]]'s [[Théâtre Optique]] at the Grevin Museum in Paris, 1892. In 1895, the [[Cinematograph]] of the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]] outshone Reynaud's invention, driving Émile to bankruptcy. However, his public performance of animation entered the history of optical entertainments as shortly predating the camera-made [[movies]].

In recent years, the event has been observed in more than 50 different countries with more than 1000 events, on every continent, all over the world. IAD was initiated by [[ASIFA]], [[International Animated Film Association]], a member of [[UNESCO]]. During International Animation Day cultural institutions are also invited to join in by screening animated films, organizing workshops, exhibiting artwork and stills, providing technical demonstrations, and organizing other events helping to promote the art of animation. Such a celebration is an outstanding opportunity of putting animated films in the limelight, making this art more accessible to the public.

ASIFA also commissions an artist to create an [[original poster|original art poster]] announcing the event each year.  It is then adapted for each country in order to guarantee a worldwide view of the event. Previous editions involved the work of animators such as Iouri Tcherenkov, [[Paul Driessen (animator)|Paul Driessen]], Abi Feijo, Eric Ledune, [[Noureddin Zarrinkelk]], [[Michel Ocelot]], [[Nina Paley]], [[Raoul Servais]], Ihab Shaker and Gianluigi Toccafondo.

Full length animation films, historical features, animated shorts, and student films, all variety of animation art are shown in the workshops. These films display an extraordinary range of techniques – drawing, painting, animating puppets and objects, using clay, sand, paper, and computer.  Because many animated films are non-verbal, it is a rich opportunity for cross cultural expression and [[cross-cultural communication|communication]].

{{nihongo|'''''Jigoku'''''|地獄||"Hell"}}, also titled '''''The Sinners of Hell''''', is a [[1960 in film|1960]] Shintoho [[J-Horror|Japanese horror film]], directed by [[Nobuo Nakagawa]] and starring [[Utako Mitsuya]] and [[Shigeru Amachi]]. The 1960 film was advertised as adult entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Galbraith,Stuart (1994). ''Japanese Fantasy, Science Fiction and Horror Films''. McFarland and Co., Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
''Jigoku'' is notable for separating itself from other [[J-horror|Japanese horror]] films of the era such as ''[[Kwaidan (film)|Kwaidan]]'' or ''[[Onibaba (film)|Onibaba]]'' due to its graphic imagery of torment in Hell.&lt;ref&gt;Galbraith,Stuart (1994). ''Japanese Fantasy, Science Fiction and Horror Films''. McFarland and Co., Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; It has gained a [[cult film]] status. Shintoho declared bankruptcy in 1961, its last production being ''Jigoku''.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1994|p=317}}

''Jigoku'' was re-made in 1969 by Toho Films (as ''[[Portrait of Hell]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Galbraith,Stuart (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;, again in 1979 by Toei Films (as simply ''Jigoku''), and later re-made once again in 1999 by Toei under the title of ''[[Jigoku: Japanese Hell]]'', directed by [[Teruo Ishii]].&lt;ref&gt;Galbraith,Stuart (1994).

==Plot==
A young Tokyo theology student, Shirō (Shigeru Amachi), is set to marry his girlfriend, Yukiko (Utako Mitsuya), the daughter of his professor, Mr. Yajima. After announcing the engagement, Shirō's dark and unsettling colleague, Tamura (Yôichi Numata), drives Shirō home, suggesting that Shirō had been sleeping with Yukiko for some time. Taking a side street at Shirō's request, Tamura hits and kills drunken yakuza gang leader, Kyōichi. Though Shirō wants to stop, Tamura keeps driving, stating that it does not concern him and that ultimately, the murder is Shirō's fault for asking him to drive down the street. Unbeknown to either of them, Kyōichi's mother (Kiyoko Tsuji) witnessed everything and resolves to find and kill them.

Though Tamura feels no guilt for the murder, Shirō does and attempts to go to the police. After telling Yukiko of what happened, Shirō insists that they take a taxi cab to the police station, despite Yukiko's pleas to walk instead. While in the cab, Shirō hallucinates that Tamura is driving the cab, and it crashes, killing Yukiko. After her funeral, Shirō seeks solace in the arms of strip bar worker and Kyōichi's grieving girlfriend Yoko (Akiko Ono), who discovers Shirō's culpability for the hit-and-run after sleeping with him and, with Kyōichi's mother, plots revenge.

Shirō receives a telegram that his mother, Ito, who lives in a country-side retirement community run by his father, Gōzō, is dying and rushes to see her. There, he meets the other residents including a disgraced painter, Ensai, who is painting a portrait of Hell, a former reporter, Akagawa, a corrupt detective, Hariya, and the community doctor, Dr. Kasuma. He meets Sachiko (also played by Mitsuya), a nurse and Ensai's daughter, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Yukiko, and is taking care of his mother. During his stay, Shirō and Sachiko become close while each of the residents' sordid activities is revealed: While Shirō's mother lies dying, his father carries on an open affair and also cheats the community of its money by cutting corners; the painter is wanted for a crime in another city; the detective threatens to turn the painter in unless he gives him Sachiko to marry; and the doctor knows his diagnoses are wrong, but feels that seeking a second opinion is too cumbersome. Both Mr. and Mrs. Yajima, both despondent after Yukiko's death, arrive by train to pay their respects to Shirō's mother. Ito dies, and Ensai blames Gōzō; decades ago, he and Ito were lovers before Gōzō came between them and married her leaving her unhappy. Inexplicably, Tamura appears and reveals that each of the residents has some complicity in a murder: Mr. Yajima killed his comrade during the war, stealing his water for himself; both the detective and reporter framed or slandered innocent men who then both committed suicide; and the doctor knew his diagnosis of Ito's condition was wrong, but chose not to tell anyone.

Yoko tracks Shirō down and meets with him on a rope bridge in the area. There she reveals her identity and attempts to shoot him while Kyōichi's mother watches from the trees, but she trips and falls to her death. Tamura appears, and the two struggle over the gun, and Tamura also falls into the gorge. Shirō stumbles back in time for the community's tenth anniversary party, where Gōzō has knowingly allowed cheap, rancid fish to be served to the residents. As the party descends into debauchery, Mr. and Mrs. Yajima both decide to leap in front of the train, killing themselves, and Gōzō's mistress falls to her death following an altercation. The residents die from consuming the tainted fish, and Kyōichi's mother sneaks into the party, poisoning the remaining residents' wine, killing them. Tamura, near death, stumbles into the party and shoots Sachiko, while Kyōichi's mother strangles Shirō to death and then commits suicide.

In Limbo, Shirō encounters Yukiko, who reveals that she was pregnant with his child, a baby girl named "Harumi", but has sent her floating away on the river of the underworld and begs Shirō to save her. Shirō enters Hell and is sentenced to punishment in the Eight Realms of Hell by Lord [[Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Enma]] for his sins. While running through Hell to find his daughter, he encounters each of his acquaintances, who suffer, in gruesome fashion, a variety of punishments for their sins, such as being boiled and burned alive, dismembered and flayed, or cut apart and beaten by ogres, only to be revived to suffer anew. Meanwhile, Tamura taunts Shirō, saying there is no escape from Hell, before being butchered for giving his soul over to evil. In a realm filled with glass shards jutting from the ground, Shirō finds Sachiko, but their reunion is interrupted by Shirō's mother, who shamefully reveals that Sachiko is his sister: Shirō is actually Ensai's son, and Sachiko is actually her daughter, also a product of her later affair with Ensai. Shirō is disgusted with his family, and continues searching for his daughter, determined to live and save her. While caught in a vortex of damned souls, he finds his baby daughter helplessly rotating on the Buddhist wheel of life. Lord Enma gives Shirō one chance to save his daughter, otherwise she too will suffer for all eternity in Hell. As Yukiko, Sachiko, and his mother call to him, Shirō leaps onto the wheel, but cannot reach his daughter.

The moment is frozen in time, revealed to be nine o'clock: the exact time that everyone at the party has finally died, including Ensai, who has hanged himself after completing his portrait of Hell and set it on fire. In a final scene, both Sachiko and Yukiko stand smiling in peaceful light, calling to Shirō as sister and lover, respectively, with lotus petals falling around them, symbolizing mental and moral purity.

==Production==
{{expand section|date=October 2015}}
[[Nobuo Nakagawa]] asked [[Ichirō Miyagawa]] to write the script, which was originally supposed to be called ''Heaven and Hell'', under order of [[Film producer|producer]] [[Mitsugu Okura]].&lt;ref name="Criterion Collection"&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Ichirō Miyagawa|Miyagawa, Ichirō]] (Writer) |date=2007-03-13 |title=Jigoku, DVD Extra: ''Building the Inferno |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Criterion Collection]] |time=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitsugu Okura read the [[Screenplay|script]] and angrily said to Miyagawa that "Heaven is nowhere to be seen in this script!", to which Miyagawa jokingly replied that he would write about Heaven in the sequel.&lt;ref name="Criterion Collection"/&gt; Actor [[Yoichi Numata]] played Tamura in the film, and expressed that he had tried to analyze the role, but couldn't find the best way to play it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Yoichi Numata|Numata, Yoichi]] (Actor) |date=2007-03-13 |title=Jigoku, DVD Extra: ''Building the Inferno |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Criterion Collection]] |time=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was not expected to be well received, as [[Shintoho]] [[Film studio|studio]] was considered to be a maker of low-budget, gory films. ''Jigoku'' was made in a hurry, and was the last Shintoho production. For the scenes which take place in [[hell]], the cast and crew used Shintoho's largest soundstage and put dirt over it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Mamoru Morita|Morita, Mamoru]] (Cinematographer) |date=2007-03-13 |title=Jigoku, DVD Extra: ''Building the Inferno |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Criterion Collection]] |time=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent documentary, a crew member said that normally it would be just the crew helping to build the sets, but because it was Shintoho's last production, all the [[Extra (actor)|extra]]s were helping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date=2007-03-13 |title=Jigoku, DVD Extra: ''Building the Inferno |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Criterion Collection]] |time=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mamoru Morita]] said that Nobuo Nakagawa tried in many ways to make ''Jigoku'' different from other [[Horror Film|horror]] films from the time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 1979, the acclaimed [[Nikkatsu]] Roman Porno director [[Tatsumi Kumashiro]] remade ''Jigoku'' for [[Toei Company|Toei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharp|first=Jasper|title=Behind the Pink Curtain: The Complete History of Japanese Sex Cinema|page= 137|year=2008|publisher=FAB Press|location=Guildford|isbn=978-1-903254-54-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}}
===Later reception===
Later reviews of the film have been more positive, with many critics now recognizing it as a cornerstone for Nakagawa’s career.
[[Dennis Schwartz]] from ''[[Ozus' World Movie Reviews]]'' awarded the film a grade "A", calling it "[a] disquieting morality tale based upon the Buddhist concept of an afterlife". Schwartz praised the film's performances, and visuals which he felt 'acted as a lurid study of sin without salvation'.&lt;ref name="schwartz06"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schwartz |first1=Dennis |title=jigoku |url=http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/jigoku.htm |website=Sover.net |publisher=Dennis Schwartz |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In an [[Film essay|essay]] for the Criterion Collection, Chuck Stephens wrote, "Overflowing with brackish ponds of bubbling pus, brain-rattling disjunctions of sound and image, and at times almost dauntingly incomprehensible plot twists and eye-assaulting bouts of brutish montage, ''Jigoku'' is more than merely a boundary-pummeling classic of the horror genre—it’s as lurid a study of sin without salvation as the silver screen has ever seen."&lt;ref name="stephens06"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stephens |first1=Chuck |title=The Criterion Collection - The Current - Jigoku: Hell on Earth |url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/448-jigoku-hell-on-earth |website=Criterion.com |publisher=Chuck Stephens |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Brett Gallman from ''Oh, the Horror!'' praised the film, calling it "a masterpiece in visual and abstract horror". Gallman praised the film's performances, eerie score, Nakagawa’s direction, and "vivid color palette".&lt;ref name="gallman10"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gallman |first1=Brett |title=Horror Reviews - Jigoku (1960) |url=http://www.oh-the-horror.com/page.php?id=713 |website=Oh the Horror.com |publisher=Brett Gallman |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''HorrorNews.net'' stated in their review of the film that, "Although this film contains effects that are outdated by modern standards, it is a very powerful story that is based upon the Buddhist belief that sins are atoned for in the afterlife."&lt;ref name="hnreview10"&gt;{{cite web |title=Film Review: Jigoku (1960) |url=http://horrornews.net/11385/film-review-jigoku-1960/ |website=HorrorNews.net |publisher=Scarlett OTerror |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film has developed a [[cult film|cult following]] over the years and is now considered a cult classic.&lt;ref name="schwartz06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cultfilm"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/explore/1-cult-movies|title=Cult Movies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5373">'''Joachim Ritter''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʁɪtɐ|lang}}; April 3, 1903 – August 3, 1974) was a German philosopher and founder of the so-called Ritter School ({{lang-de|Ritter-Schule}}).

==Biography==
Born in [[Geesthacht]], Ritter studied philosophy, theology, German literature, and history in [[Heidelberg]], [[Marburg]], [[Freiburg]] and [[Hamburg]]. A disciple of [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Ernst Cassirer]], he obtained his doctorate with a dissertation on [[Nicolas of Cusa]] in 1925. Ritter was Cassirer's assistant and a lecturer at the [[University of Hamburg]]. A [[Marxism|Marxist]] in the late 1920s and early 1930s, he became a member of the [[Nazi Party]] in 1937 and an officer of the German [[Wehrmacht]] in 1940. After [[World War II]], Ritter was appointed professor of philosophy at the [[University of Münster]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Schweda, ''Joachim Ritter und die Ritter-Schule zur Einführung'', Hamburg: Junius 2015, p. 14-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritter's philosophical work focuses on a theory of [[modernity]]. In a liberal interpretation of [[Hegel|Hegel's]] ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right|Philosophy of Right]]'', he developed the view that "bifurcation" is the constitutive structure of the modern world and a necessary precondition for the universal realization of individual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Comay, ''Mourning Sickness: Hegel and the French Revolution'', Stanford: Stanford University Press 2011, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ritter's theory of culture as compensation, arts and humanities have the function of balancing the [[Disenchantment|disenchanted]], ahistorical condition of modern society.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas E. Di Liberto, [http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1102&amp;context=edissertations ''Overcoming the Empty Years: the Role of Philosophy and the Humanities in West Germany after 1945''] (2009). Publicly accessible Penn Dissertations. Paper 89, p. 307-312.&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], his work on [[Aristotle]]'s ethics and political theory initiated the renewal of practical philosophy in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Kelvin Knight, ''Aristotelian Philosophy: Ethics and Politics from Aristotle to MacIntyre'', Cambridge: Polity 2007, p. 64-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Münster]].

==Legacy==
Ritter is considered one of the most influential philosophers in postwar [[West Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Jan Werner Müller, ''A Dangerous Mind: Carl Schmitt in Post-War European Thought'', Yale University Press 2003, p. 116-132&lt;/ref&gt; Among his disciples were scholars and public intellectuals like [[Ernst-Wolfgang Böckenförde]], [[Max Imdahl]], [[Hermann Lübbe]], [[Odo Marquard]], and [[Robert Spaemann]]. Together with them, Ritter started the „Historisches Wörterbuch der Philosophie“ and contributed to development of [[conceptual history]] in the field of philosophy. In the 1980s, [[Jürgen Habermas]] opposed the Ritter School for being leading representatives of German [[neo-conservatism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''Neoconservative Culture Criticism in the United States and West Germany: An Intellectual Movement in Two Political Cultures'', in: Télos 1983 (56), p. 75-89. &lt;/ref&gt; More recent scholarship in intellectual history points out Ritter's seminal role for the modernization of German political thought and the development of a modern [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[republicanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jens Hacke, ''Philosophie der Bürgerlichkeit. Die liberalkonservative Begründung der Bundesrepublik'', Göttingen: Wallstein 2006/2008. See also Jerry Z. Muller, ''German Neo-Conservatism ca. 1968–1985.

'''Karel Hašler''' (31 October 1879 in [[Prague]] – 22 December 1941 in [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]]) was a [[Czech people|Czech]] songwriter, actor, lyricist, film and theatre director, composer, writer, dramatist, screenwriter and cabaretier. He was murdered in the Mauthausen concentration camp.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web | title=Singer and songwriter Karel Hasler was born 125 years ago  | url=http://www.radio.cz/en/article/58960 | work= | publisher=Radio Prague |author=Horáková, Pavla | date=8 October 2004 | accessdate=27 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Hašler studied to be a glove-maker, but he became intererested in theatre at a young age and occasionally performed with amateur theatre ensembles. In 1897, following his debut at the ''Aréna Theatre'' he left home and successively joined various travelling theatre companies.&lt;ref name="Fikejz367"&gt;[[#Fikejz|Fikejz (2006)]], p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902 he became a member of the Slovenian theatre in [[Ljubljana]], but soon moved back to Prague, where he joined the [[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theatre]] ensemble.&lt;ref name="Fikejz367"/&gt; In the National Theatre, he asserted himself in conversational plays. In addition to that, he also attempted to apply his singing abilities. Around 1908, he started composing his own music, and at the same time he began to incline to cabaret activities.&lt;ref name="Fikejz367"/&gt; Gradually he became a director and head of various Prague cabarets, such as ''Lucerna'' (1910–1915, 1918–1923), ''Rokoko'' (1915–1918) and ''[[Karlín]] Variety Theatre'' (1924–1929). In 1908, he married a sister of pianist and composer [[Rudolf Friml]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Karel Hašler? Největší český hitmaker | url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/mfdnes.asp?r=vikendV&amp;v=255&amp;c=1281519 | work= | publisher=iDnes.cz | author=Homolová, Marie | date=31 October 2009 | accessdate=2 November 2009}} ''(Jednou tak zabrousil do hospody, kde se potkal s Rudolfem Frimlem, a byla to chvíle osudová, nejen proto, že se oženil s Frimlovou sestrou Zdenou.)'' {{cs icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deyl202"&gt;[[#Deyl|Deyl (2007)]], p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]] he also began to appear in [[silent film]]s, as an actor, director and author. In 1914, he made a comedy ''České hrady a zámky'' (Czech Castles), based on his own script. The film was intended as an introduction for the play ''Pán bez kvartýru'' (A Man Without Flat).&lt;ref name="Fikejz367"/&gt; He appeared also in the comedy 
''Ahasver'' and in other silent films.

Among his most successful film roles were the lawyer and deputy Uher in the drama film ''Batalion'' (The Battalion, 1927) by [[Přemysl Pražský]], and the organist in ''Varhaník u sv. Víta'' (Organist at [[St. Vitus Cathedral]], 1929) by [[Martin Frič]]. The coming era of the [[sound film]] in 1930s enabled Hašler to utilize his singing skills. In his first sound film role ''Písničkář'' (Balladeer, 1932) by [[Svatopluk Innemann]] he sang patriotic songs ''Svoboda'' (Freedom) and ''[[Ta naše písnička česká]]'' (Our Czech song), among others.&lt;ref name="Fikejz368"&gt;[[#Fikejz|Fikejz (2006)]], p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, in his last film role, he played himself in ''Za tichých nocí'' (In the Quiet Nights), made by his son Gina Hašler. From 1932 to 1941 Hašler played in more than 13 films. In September 1941, during production of the film ''Městečko na dlani'', based on the script by [[Jan Drda]], he was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] and sent to the Mauthausen [[concentration camp]]. The main reason for his arrest was his patriotic songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Scény z prezidentské kuchyně" uvidí v Hradci Králové | url=http://www.rozhlas.cz/hradec/zpravy/_zprava/555132 | work= | publisher=Czech Radio – [[Hradec Králové]] | date= | accessdate=30 August 2009|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deyl300–303"&gt;[[#Deyl|Deyl (2007)]], p. 300–303&lt;/ref&gt; In Mauthausen he was tortured to death.&lt;ref name="Fikejz368"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web | title=Music Against the War | url=http://www.musicology.upol.cz/articles/against.html | work= | publisher=[[Palacký University, Olomouc]] | date= |author=Vičar, Jan | accessdate=28 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-war [[Communist Czechoslovakia]] he was officially ignored for political reasons, because many of his songs hailed [[Tomáš Masaryk]] and [[Czechoslovak Legion]]naires, and mocked [[interbellum]] communists.&lt;ref&gt;"From Good King Wenceslas to the Good Soldier Švejk: A Dictionary of Czech Popular Culture", [https://books.google.com/books?id=6qlnrXT2yS0C&amp;pg=PA54 p. 54]&lt;/ref&gt;

''"Hašlerky"'' is a recognizable type of songs, written by Hašler and of similar character.

Czech astronomer [[Lenka Kotková]] (née L. Šarounová) named asteroid [[37939 Hašler]] after him.&lt;ref name="JP: Small-body Database Browser"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=37939 |  title = JPL Small-Body Database Browser | accessdate = 28 April 2008 | publisher = [[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Czech directors Marek Jícha and Josef Lustig made a documentary ''Písničkář, který nezemřel'' (The Immortal Balladeer of Prague) describing the fate of Hašler's illegitimate son Thomas Hasler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Immortal Balladeer of Prague | url=http://www.kviff.com/en/film-archive-detail/20082274-the-immortal-balladeer-of-prague/ | work= | publisher=[[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]] | date= | accessdate=28 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the occasion of Hašler's 130th anniversary (2009) a monument by sculptor Stanislav Hanzík was unveiled at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Old Castle Steps|cs|3=Staré zámecké schody}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazin.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/pri-odhalovani-pomniku-haslerovi-davy-lidi-ucpaly-zamecke-schody/405438 ''Při odhalování pomníku Hašlerovi davy lidí ucpaly zámecké schody''] – České noviny, 31.&amp;nbsp;10. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ct24.cz/domaci/spolecnost/71172-praha-oslavila-130-vyroci-karla-haslera-odhalenim-pomniku/ ''Praha oslavila 130.&amp;nbsp;výročí Karla Hašlera odhalením pomníku''] – ČT24, 31.&amp;nbsp;10. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the band [[Patrola Šlapeto]] recorded a CD and DVD with 23 Hašler's songs based on original recordings found in musical archives. While there have been plenty recordings of Hasler's songs, this was the first in 80 years recording of the original tunes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/kultura/hudba/patrola-slapeto-nahrala-zapomenute-haslerovy-slagry_283011.html#.Ut9XTPTTli1 "Patrola Šlapeto nahrála zapomenuté Hašlerovy šlágry"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Karel Hašlers artistic output consists mainly of songs. He created more than 300 compositions, many of which became popular "folk songs". With his engaged patriotic approach he helped to strengthen the national consciousness of Czech people during times of danger and oppression.&lt;ref name="Fikejz368"/&gt; Following his death in the concentration camp, his songs became a symbol of national resistance.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

{{other uses|Legend (disambiguation)|Legendary (disambiguation)}}[[File:Lady godiva full.jpg|thumb|In this 1891 painting of [[Lady Godiva]] by [[Jules Joseph Lefebvre]], the authentic historical person is fully submerged in the legend, presented in an [[anachronistic]] high [[mediaeval]] setting.]]

'''Legend''' is a [[Folklore genre|genre of folklore]] that consists of a [[narrative]] featuring human actions perceived or believed both by teller and listeners to have taken place within human history. Narratives in this genre may demonstrate human values, and possess certain qualities that give the tale [[verisimilitude (literature)|verisimilitude]]. Legend, for its active and passive participants, includes no happenings that are outside the realm of "possibility," but may include [[miracle]]s. Legends may be transformed over time, in order to keep them fresh, vital, and [[realism (arts)|realistic]]. Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Folkloristics |year=1995 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=United States of America |isbn=0-253-32934-5 |pages=7 |author=Georges, Robert; Owens, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brothers Grimm]] defined legend as [[Folklore|folktale]] historically grounded.&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Krapf, ''Beneath the Cherry Sapling: Legends from Franconia'' (New York: Fordham University Press) 1988, devotes his opening section to distinguishing the [[genre]] of legend from other narrative forms, such as [[fairy tale]]; he "reiterates the Grimms' definition of legend as a folktale historically grounded", according to Hans Sebald's review in ''German Studies Review'' '''13'''.2 (May 1990), p 312.&lt;/ref&gt; A modern [[folklore|folklorist]]'s professional definition of ''legend'' was proposed by Timothy R. Tangherlini in 1990:&lt;ref&gt;Tangherlini, "'It Happened Not Too Far from Here...': A Survey of Legend Theory and Characterization" ''Western Folklore'' '''49'''.4 (October 1990:371–390) p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Legend, typically, is a short (mono-) episodic, traditional, highly ecotypified&lt;ref&gt;That is to say, specifically located in place and time.&lt;/ref&gt; historicized narrative performed in a conversational mode, reflecting on a psychological level a symbolic representation of folk belief and collective experiences and serving as a reaffirmation of commonly held values of the group to whose tradition it belongs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Etymology and origin==
[[File:Holger danske.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Holger Danske]], a legendary character]]

''Legend'' is a [[loanword]] from [[Old French]] that entered English usage circa 1340. The Old French noun ''legende'' derives from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''legenda''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', s.v. "legend"&lt;/ref&gt; In its early English-language usage, the word indicated a narrative of an event. The word ''legendary'' was originally a noun (introduced in the 1510s) meaning a collection or corpus of legends.&lt;ref name="etymonline"&gt;{{OEtymD|legendary|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|legendry}}&lt;/ref&gt; This word changed to ''legendry'', and ''legendary'' became the adjectival form.&lt;ref name="etymonline" /&gt;

By 1613, English-speaking [[Protestant]]s began to use the word when they wished to imply that an event (especially the story of any [[saint]] not acknowledged in [[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Actes and Monuments]]'') was fictitious. Thus, ''legend'' gained its modern connotations of "undocumented" and "[[wikt:spurious|spurious]]", which distinguish it from the meaning of ''[[chronicle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Collinson. ''Elizabethans'', "Truth and Legend: The Veracity of John Foxe's Book of Martyrs" 2003:151–77, balances the authentic records and rhetorical presentation of Foxe's ''Acts and Monuments'', itself a mighty force of Protestant legend-making. Sherry L. Reames, ''The Legenda Aurea: a reexamination of its paradoxical history'', 1985, examines the "Renaissance verdict" on the Legenda, and its wider influence in skeptical approaches to Catholic [[hagiography]] in general.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, [[Jacob Grimm]] described the [[fairy tale]] as "poetic, legend historic."&lt;ref&gt;''Das Märchen ist poetischer, die Sage, historischer'', quoted at the commencement of Tangherlini's survey of legend scholarship (Tangherlini 1990:371)&lt;/ref&gt; Early scholars such as {{Interlanguage link multi|Karl Wehrhan|2=de|3=Karl Wehrhan|preserve=1}}&lt;ref&gt;Wehrhan ''Die Sage'' (Leipzig) 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Ranke]]&lt;ref&gt;Ranke, "Grundfragen der Volkssagen Forshung", in Leander Petzoldt (ed.), ''Vergleichende Sagenforschung'' 1971:1–20, noted by Tangherlini 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Will Erich Peuckert]]&lt;ref&gt;Peuckert , ''Sagen'' (Munich: E Schmidt) 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; followed Grimm's example in focussing solely on the literary narrative, an approach that was enriched particularly after the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;This was stimulated in part, Tangherlini suggests, by the 1962 congress of the International Society for Folk Narrative Research.&lt;/ref&gt; by addressing questions of performance and the anthropological and psychological insights provided in considering legends' social context. Questions of categorising legends, in hopes of compiling a content-based series of categories on the line of the [[Aarne–Thompson]] folktale index, provoked a search for a broader new synthesis.

In an early attempt at defining some basic questions operative in examining folk tales, {{Interlanguage link multi|Friedrich Ranke|2=de|3=Friedrich Ranke|preserve=1}} in 1925&lt;ref&gt;Ranke, "Grundfragen der Volkssagenforschung", ''Niederdeutsche Zeitschrift für Volkskunde'' '''3''' (1925, reprinted 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; characterised the folk legend as "a popular narrative with an objectively untrue imaginary content"  a dismissive position that was subsequently largely abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Charles L. Perdue Jt., reviewing [[Linda Dégh]] and Andrew Vászony's essay "The crack on the red goblet or truth and the modern legend" in Richard M. Dorson, ed. ''Folklore in the Modern World'', (The Hague: Mouton)1978, in ''The Journal of American Folklore'' '''93''' No. 369 (July–September 1980:367), remarked on Ranke's definition, criticised in the essay, as a "dead issue". A more recent examination of the balance between oral performance and literal truth at work in legends forms Gillian Bennett's chapter "Legend: Performance and Truth" in Gillian Bennett and Paul Smith, eds. ''Contemporary Legend'' (Garland) 1996:17–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to the highly structured folktale, legend is comparatively amorphous, [[Helmut de Boor]] noted in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;de Boor, "Märchenforschung", ''Zeitschrift für Deutschkunde'' '''42''' 1928:563–81.&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative content of legend is in realistic mode, rather than the wry [[irony]] of folktale;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lutz Röhrich]], ''Märchen und Wirklichkeit: Eine volkskundliche Untersuchung'' (Wiesbaden: Steiner Verlag) 1956:9–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilhelm Heiske&lt;ref&gt;Heiske, "Das Märchen ist poetischer, die Sage, historischer: Versuch einer Kritik", ''Deutschunterricht'''''14''' 1962:69–75..&lt;/ref&gt; remarked on the similarity of [[motif (folkloristics)|motifs]] in legend and folktale and concluded that, in spite of its realistic [[Literary mode|mode]], legend is not more historical than folktale.

In ''Einleitung in der Geschichtswissenschaft'' (1928), [[Ernst Bernheim]] asserted that a legend is simply a longstanding [[rumour]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernheim, ''Einleitung in der Geschichtswissenschaft''(Berlin: de Gruyter) 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Allport]] credited the staying-power of some rumours to the persistent cultural state-of-mind that they embody and capsulise;&lt;ref&gt;Allport, ''The Psychology of Rumor'' (New York: Holt, Rinehart) 1947:164.&lt;/ref&gt; thus "[[Urban legend]]s" are a feature of rumour.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bengt af Klintberg]], "Folksägner i dag" ''Fataburen'' 1976:269–96.&lt;/ref&gt; When Willian Jansen suggested that legends that disappear quickly were "short-term legends" and the persistent ones be termed "long-term legends", the distinction between legend and rumour was effectively obliterated, Tangherlini concluded.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, "Legend: oral tradition in the modern experience", ''Folklore Today, A Festschrift for William Dorson'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press) 1972:265–72, noted in Tangherlini 1990:375.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian ''legenda''==
{{main article|Legendary material in Christian hagiography}}

In the narrow Christian sense, ''legenda'' ("things to be read [on a certain day, in church]") were [[hagiographical]] accounts, often collected in a legendary. Because saints' lives are often included in many miracle stories, ''legend'', in a wider sense, came to refer to any story that is set in a historical context but that contains [[supernatural]], divine or fantastic elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09121a.htm ''Literary or Profane Legends'']. Catholic Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hübner Bürkner Genoveva.jpg|thumb|The mediaeval legend of [[Genevieve of Brabant]] connected her to [[Treves]].]]

[[Hippolyte Delehaye]] distinguished legend from [[mythology|myth]]: "The ''legend'', on the other hand, has, of necessity, some historical or topographical connection. It refers imaginary events to some real personage, or it localizes romantic stories in some definite spot."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/delehaye-legends.html Hippolyte Delehaye, ''The Legends of the Saints: An Introduction to Hagiography'' (1907)], Chapter I: Preliminary Definitions&lt;/ref&gt;

From the moment a legend is retold as fiction, its authentic legendary qualities begin to fade and recede: in ''[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]'',  [[Washington Irving]] transformed a local Hudson River Valley legend into a literary anecdote with [[Gothic novel|"Gothic" overtones]], which actually tended to diminish its character as genuine legend.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

Stories that exceed the boundaries of "[[Realism (arts)|realism]]" are called "[[fable]]s". For example, the [[talking animal]] formula of [[Aesop]] identifies his brief stories as fables, not legends. The parable of the [[Prodigal Son]] would be a legend if it were told as having actually happened to a specific son of a historical father. If it included a [[donkey]] that gave sage advice to the Prodigal Son it would be a fable.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

Legend may be transmitted orally, passed on person-to-person, or, in the original sense, through written text. [[Jacob de Voragine]]'s ''Legenda Aurea'' or "The Golden Legend" comprises a series of ''vitae'' or instructive  biographical narratives, tied to the [[liturgical calendar]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. They are presented as lives of the saints, but the profusion of miraculous happenings and above all their uncritical context are characteristics of [[hagiography]]. The ''Legenda'' was intended to inspire extemporized homilies and sermons appropriate to the [[saint]] of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy R. Tangherlini, "'It Happened Not Too Far from Here...': A Survey of Legend Theory and Characterization" ''Western Folklore'' '''49'''.4 (October 1990:371–390). A condensed survey with extensive bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban legend==
[[File:Union Graveyard II.jpg|thumb|The tale of the White Lady who haunts Union Cemetery is a variant of the [[Vanishing hitchhiker]] legend.]]
{{main|Urban legend}}

The [[vanishing hitchhiker]] is the best-known [[urban legend]] in America, traceable as far back as 1870, but it is found around the world including in Korea and Russia. In the legend, a young girl in a white dress picked up alongside of the road by a passerby. The unknown girl in white remains silent for the duration of her ride, thanks the driver, and quietly gets out at her destination. When the driver turns to look back, the girl has vanished.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Gillian. (1998). ''The Vanishing Hitchhiker at Fifty-Five''. ''[[Western Folklore]]''. Vol. 57, No. 1. pp. 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Langlois, Janet L."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Langlois|first1=Janet L. |title=The Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends and Their Meanings by Jan Harold Brunvand |journal=The Journal of American Folklore |date=July–September 1983 |volume=96 |issue=381 |pages=356–357 |jstor=540959  |doi=10.2307/540959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Georges&gt;{{cite book |last=Georges, Jones|first=Robert, Michael |title=Folkloristics |year=1995 |publisher=Indiana University Press |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fine, Gary Alan"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fine |first1=Gary Alan |title=The Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends and Their Meanings by Jan Harold Brunvand |journal=Western Folklore |date=April 1982 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=156–157 |jstor=1499791 |publisher=Western States Folklore Society |doi=10.2307/1499791}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, Beardsley and Hankey collected 79 written accounts of the legend.&lt;ref name="Beardsley 1942"&gt;Beardsley, Richard K; Hankey, Rosalie.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4146">{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of colossal sculpture ''in situ''}}
This is a list of '''colossal sculptures that were carved ''in situ'' ''' (or "in place"), sometimes referred to as "living rock". This list includes two colossal stones that were intended to be moved. However, they were never broken free of the quarry in which they were carved, and therefore they would be considered carved in situ. Most of these were carved in ancient times.

In most cases, especially in [[India]], the sculptures were carved out of "soft" rock like [[basalt]] or volcanic [[tuff]]. However, in some cases they were carved out of harder rock like [[sandstone]], or even [[granite]] in the case of the [[unfinished obelisk]]. The Egyptians may have been limited to using 10-pound [[dolerite]] balls to chip away at the granite.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Dr. I.E.S.: The Pyramids of Egypt 1986/1947 p. 269-273&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dynamite]] was used in the carving of Mount Rushmore, another of the few colossal sculptures that was carved out of granite.

The '''Ministry of Construction of Heavy Industry of the USSR''' ('''Mintyazhstroy'''; {{lang-ru|Министерство строительства предприятий тяжелой промышленности СССР}}) was a [[central government]] [[institution]] charged with leading the [[heavy industry]] of the [[Soviet Union]].  It was established in 1946 to replace the several successor Commissariats to the [[People's Commissariat of Heavy Industry]] of the USSR, dissolved in 1939.  After liquidation in 1953, it was reactivated from 1967 to 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://guides.rusarchives.ru/browse/gbfond.html?bid=102&amp;fund_id=268227 |title=Путеводитель |year=1994 |work=Краткий справочник фондов |publisher=Российский государственный архив экономики |accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ministry headquarters was one of the [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|Seven Sisters]] built during the last 10 years of Stalin's life, also known as the [[Red Gates Administrative Building|Red Gate building]] owing to its proximity to the [[Red Gate]] Square.

Founded in 1893, the '''National Sculpture Society''' ('''NSS''') was the first organization of professional [[sculptor]]s formed in the [[United States]].  The purpose of the organization was to promote the welfare of American sculptors, although its founding members included several renowned [[architect]]s.  The founding members included such well known figures of the day as [[Daniel Chester French]], [[Augustus St. Gaudens]], [[Richard Morris Hunt]], and [[Stanford White]] as well as sculptors less familiar today, such as [[Herbert Adams (sculptor)|Herbert Adams]], [[Paul W. Bartlett]], [[Karl Bitter]], [[J. Massey Rhind]], and [[John Quincy Adams Ward]]—who served as the first president for the society.

Since its founding in the nineteenth century, the National Sculpture Society (NSS) has remained dedicated to promoting figurative and realistic sculpture. During the years 1919 to 1924, four works commissioned from members of the National Sculpture Society were funded by philanthropist [[Paul Goodloe McIntire]], including ''[[George Rogers Clark (sculpture)|George Rogers Clark]]'' (1921) by [[Robert Ingersoll Aitken]] at [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=VAnom&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Cities/Charlottesville/104-0252_George_Rogers_Clark_Sculpture_1997_Final_Nomination.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: George Rogers Clark Sculpture |author=Betsy Gohdes-Baten |date=April 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership worldwide in 2006 was around 4,000 members, including sculptors, architects, art historians, and conservators. Its headquarters, library, and gallery are located on [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]] in [[Manhattan]], just north of [[Grand Central Terminal]]. There is an entrance to the building from [[Lexington Avenue]] also.

The NSS publishes ''[[Sculpture Review]]'', a quarterly magazine.

Past presidents of the society have included [[John Quincy Adams Ward]], [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Earle Fraser]], [[Chester Beach]], [[Wheeler Williams]], [[Leo Friedlander]] and [[Cecil de Blaquiere Howard]].

The first woman to gain admission into the NSS was [[Theo Alice Ruggles Kitson]], in 1895. She was followed a few years later by [[Enid Yandell]], in 1899 and [[Abastenia St. Leger Eberle]] in 1906. In 1946 [[Richmond Barthé]] was likely the first [[African-American]] to be admitted.

In 1994 the NSS held their first exhibition outside the United States at the Palazzo Mediceo Di Seravezza in Italy.  Titled “100 Years of the National Sculpture Society of the United States of America in Italy” it ran from the 16th of July through the 4th of September and was curated by Nicky and [[Stanley Bleifeld]] along with Costantino Paolicchi in collaboration with Lodovico Gierut and Paolo Giorgi.  Among the 60 notable American sculptors whose work was selected for the exhibition were [[Stanley Bleifeld]], [[Andrew DeVries]], Neil Estern, Leonda Finke, [[Bruno Lucchesi]], Barbara Lekberg, [[Richard MacDonald]] and Elliott Offner.&lt;ref&gt;National Sculpture Society, Finito di stampare nel mese di luglio 1994 dalle EDIZIONI ETS Pisa&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ocotlán de Morelos''' is a town and [[Municipalities of Mexico|municipality]] in the state of [[Oaxaca]], about 35&amp;nbsp;km south of the center of the city of [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]] along Highway 175.
It is part of the [[Ocotlán District, Oaxaca|Ocotlán District]] in the south of the [[Valles Centrales de Oaxaca|Valles Centrales Region]].&lt;ref name="MexDesOax"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Quintanar Hinojosa |first=Beatriz  |date=August 2007 |title=Ocotlán |journal=Guía México Desconocido: Oaxaca |volume= 137  |pages=30–31  |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ipn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cecoax.ipn.mx/Revista/2009/febrero/contenido/images/pdf/28.pdf |title=Ocotlan de Morelos Oax.

The name Ocotlan is from [[Nahuatl]] and means "among the [[ocote]] trees" with the appendage "de Morelos" added in honor of [[José María Morelos y Pavón]]. During the colonial period the area was known as Santo Domingo Ocotlán due to the Dominican friars who created a monastery here dedicated to [[Saint Dominic]]. The [[Zapotec languages|Zapotec]] name for the area is "Lachiroo" which means "large valley" although some Zapotecs in the [[Tlacolula de Matamoros|Tlacolula]] area called it "Guelache" which means "plaza of the valley".&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:HallOcotlanLibrary.JPG|thumb|left|Hall on upper level of the former monastery]]
The ethnicity of the first populations of this area is not known, but one of the earliest settlements is a site called Tortolita, located two km from the modern town center.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt; When the Spanish arrived, the settlement had about 2,000 inhabitants, which is why the monastery was eventually founded here.&lt;ref name="redes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://redesdelconocimiento.com/foro/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;catid=42:valles-centrales&amp;id=191:ocotlan-de-morelos&amp;Itemid=109&amp;lang=es |title= Ocotlan de Morelos |year=2008  |work= Redes del Conocimiento  |publisher= Redes del Conocimiento y Redes Educativas |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=April 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1538, the bishopric sent Dominicans to found a parish. The monastery was founded in 1555 and called Santo Domingo de Ocotlán. The official founding of the town by Diego Hernandez Domingo Luis and Juan Vazquez also occurred in 1555.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt; The complex was never finished because the local people also worked in the mines established nearby.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt;
By the 18th century, Octolan has eight small neighborhoods including one called Santa María Tocuela (the oldest) and San Juan Chilatece in which the market was founded.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="puso"/&gt;

During the Mexican War of Independence, Morelos camped here for three days on his way to Acapulco. Ocotlan was officially declared a town in 1875.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

In 1916, forces loyal to [[Venustiano Carranza]] successfully defended the town from an attack led by General Macario Hernandez.  Ocotlan was officially declared a city in 1926.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

Since the [[Mexican Revolution]], the city has been mostly quiet but the current construction of a superhighway linking the city of Oaxaca has been bringing changes to the area. The road called Camino Real a San Juan was recently paved, and event that drew the attendance of the governor of Oaxaca. Other newly paved roads include Calle Industria, Calle Francisco Villa and Calle Ayuntamiento. The new paving is meant to relieve traffic congestion on the roads to [[Ejutla de Crespo]] and the city of Oaxaca by providing alternate routes for current and future traffic.&lt;ref name="puso"/&gt;

[[2006 Oaxaca protests|In 2006, the social uprisings that affected much of Oaxaca]] affected Ocotlán. Much of the social unrest centered around the mines that are located in the municipality and consequences continue to this day. A mining labor leader from the area, Napolean Gomez Urrutia, living in Vancouver, is seeking asylum in Canada after the Mexican government asked for his extradition. He is accused of fraud, criminal associated and other offences associated with the social uprisings. Before he left for Canada, Gomez Urrutia was demanding an investigation into the deaths of 65 workers at a coal mine in the area.&lt;ref name="mines"&gt;{{cite news |title= Mexico seeks extradition of exiled labour leader |first=Marina |last=Jimenez |url= http://www.minesandcommunities.org/article.php?a=9061 |newspaper= Toronto Globe and Mail |location=Toronto |date=February 6, 2009 |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, protesters from several communities in the municipality blocked a highway to demand the cancellation of an arrest warrant against residents who opposed the operation of a mine and demand talks to close the La Trinidad mine. The mine belongs to a Mexican-Canadian company called Cuxcatlan. Protesters claim the mine is polluting their lands. The protesters were supported by Section 22 of the SNTE and [[APPO]].&lt;ref name="protestan"&gt;{{cite news |title= Protestan pobladores contra instalación de mina en Oaxaca |url= http://www.cminoticiasoaxaca.com/Desarrollo/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=1%3Anoticias&amp;id=3091%3Aprotestan-pobladores-contra-instalacion-de-mina-en-oaxaca&amp;option=com_content |agency=CMI Noticias |newspaper=CMI Noticias |location=Mexico |date=June 18, 2009 |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Residents protest against mine installation in Oaxaca }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cerrar"&gt;{{cite news |title= Demandan cerrar mina en Oaxaca |first= Octavio |last= Vélez Ascencio |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2009/06/18/index.php?section=estados&amp;article=031n2est |newspaper=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=June 19, 2009 |page=31 |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Demanding closure of mine in Oaxaca }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unrelated controversy in 2008 involved child pornography charges against the Colegio Guadalupe school. Implicated are several parents and photographer Norberto Dionisio Martinez. The photographs in question involved partially nude women, men and children in a classroom at the school. Angry parents have protested and sued the school although those involved claimed no pornographic acts were involved.&lt;ref name="demandan"&gt;{{cite news |title= Demandan a padres que denunciaron abusos contra sus hijos en escuela católica de Oaxaca |first= Octavio |last= Vélez Ascencio |url= http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2008/08/28/index.php?section=estados&amp;article=036n1est |newspaper=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=August 28, 2008 |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Parents demand prosecution of abuses against their children in a Catholic school in Oaxaca }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The city==
[[File:KioskOcotlan.JPG|thumb|left|Kiosk in the main plaza]]
The city can seem like an ordinary and even empty town at first glance.&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt; However, because of its geographic location on the south end of the Central Valleys region of Oaxaca, the city is a distribution center for local towns and smaller cities such as [[Santa Lucía Miahuatlán]]. It is also a point of transit for those traveling between the state capital and the coast, a role that will be enforced with the completion of the new modern highway.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; One reason the area is relatively quiet is that for many years, until recently, its churches, monastery, plazas and gardens lay unkempt against the effects of the sun and time, as well as vandalism. Most of the restoration work was sponsored by artist Rodolfo Morales, a native of Ocotlán.&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt;

The city's main attraction is the Temple and Ex-convent of Santo Domingo de Guzmán.  The complex was constructed in various stages between the 16th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="MexDesOax"/&gt;  The construction of the monastery was halted on several occasions due the lack of manpower, due to the discovery of mines nearby such as Santa Catarina.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;  The main vault, [[apse]], [[choir (architecture)|choir]] and [[sacristy]] of the church were not finished until 1669. The pillars of the cloister were begun at this time as well, but were never finished.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt;

[[File:CourtyardChurchOcotlan.JPG|thumb|Courtyard of monastery with church behind]]
From then until the early 19th century, much of the complex was poorly maintained and fell into ruins. Starting in 1804, the Dominicans worked to rehabilitate the building, with attempts continuing until the complex was appropriated by the federal government during the [[Reform War|Reform Laws]]. Ocotlan was one of the last towns in Oaxaca to still have friars in residence in the 19th century but by 1855, the last one had left.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;  By 1885, the monastery area was completely abandoned, but the church was still functioning and remaining in relatively good condition.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt;

[[File:OcotlanJuanEv.jpg|thumb|left|''Santo'' of Saint John, from the Chapel of the Señor de la Sacristia]]After it was no longer used as a monastery, the complex has several uses, including that of a prison, where inmates made crafts. In the latter 20th century, the Rodolfo Morales Foundation restored and converted the monastery space into a museum, which contains one room with works by Morales, one room with Oaxaca crafts and one room with artwork from the colonial period. There are also sound and book libraries. In the courtyard where the old pillory is, are held cultural events and photography shoots.&lt;ref name="MexDesOax"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt;   The church was also restored by the foundation, but maintains its religious function.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

The church is fronted by a very large [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] fenced by a stone wall. The main facade has two bodies and a crest with both [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] elements. The first body contains the door arch and the second is marked by the choir window. Both bodies are flanked by columns with [[Ionic order]] capitols. The columns extend up the facade and have profuse vegetative decoration. At the top, there is a shell. In the interior is the Chapel of the Senor de la Sacristia, which is decorated in Neoclassical style.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; In both the church and the chapel are found a large number of colonial-era ''santos'' (statues of saints), many executed in fine polychrome and well preserved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aug.edu/augusta/santos/ocotlan/index.html Santos in Oaxaca's Ancient Churches: Santo Domingo Ocotlán]. Retrieved 2012-04-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MuniPalExpoOctolan.JPG|thumb|left|Municipal palace]]
The municipal palace has a sober Neoclassic facade built with pink stone, with columns and pediments.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt; The main feature are the arches which rest on columns with rectangular bases, forming portals. It was designed to be a focus point for social interaction.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; The main feature of the interior is the mural work done in the council chambers by Rodolfo Morales in the 1950s, when he was a young man. The mural work depicts scenes from the history of Ocotlán as well as landscapes and representative scenes such as the [[Traditional fixed markets in Mexico|municipality markets]], mining and agriculture. Unfortunately, this work does not receive the care it deserves as the chambers have been used for storage as well as meetings.&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt;&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; This palace was constructed to commemorate the Centennial of Mexican Independence which occurred in 1910,&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt; and was completed in 1913.&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt;
[[File:PatioMoralesHouseOcotlan.JPG|thumb|Courtyard of the Morales house]]
The Rodolfo Morales house is a mansion from the 18th century which he rescued and lived in. Today, the building is a cultural center with an open-air theatre, which can seat 200 people, galleries of work by local artists and a computer center. All activities and resources here are offered free of charge.&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt;&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fundacion"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fcrom.org.mx/es/fundacion/fundacion.html |title= Fundación Cultural Rodolfo Morales A.C.  |publisher= Fundación Cultural Rodolfo Morales A.C.  |location=Ocotlan de Morelos, Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=April 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The house is located just north of the main square and preserves a number of Morales personal effects, including collages.&lt;ref name="MexDesOax"/&gt; The building is also home to the Fundación Cultural Rodolfo Morales, A. C (Rodolfo Morales Cultural Foundation), which  is a private, nonprofit organization which promotes education and culture in the Ocotlan District of the state of Oaxaca. The Foundation realizes restorations, the maintenance and conservation of architectural monuments, paintings and sculptures and trains young people in restoration work. The foundation was created in 1992 by Rodolfo Morales.&lt;ref name="fundacion"/&gt;
The Octolan railroad station was built along the old Ferrocarril San Jerónimo to San Pablo Huixtepec line in 1906. In 1909, a second platform was built.&lt;ref name="ferrocarril"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sic.gob.mx/ficha.php?table=fnme&amp;table_id=132&amp;estado_id=20 |first= |work=Ferrocarril de Mexico |title= Ocotlán |publisher=CONACULTA |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=April 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VirginOcotlan2.JPG|thumb|The Virgin of Ocotlán]]
A number of important traditions are maintained in the community. The feast of the Virgin of Ocotlán is celebrated on 15 May. Most of the festivities take place on the main square of the town with live music and regional food, especially [[tamale]]s and [[atole]]. The feast of the Señor de la Sacristia is celebrated on the third Sunday in May. One old tradition that is still maintained is a dancing procession to bring the bride and groom their wedding gifts to their new home.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;
However, the most important tradition is the weekly Friday market day ([[tianguis]]), which is one of the oldest and largest in the Central Valleys region of Oaxaca. Produce and products from surrounding towns are available as well as manufactured products.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt; Market day is not just buying and selling for rural and indigenous communities, it is a festive ritual which has been held regularly for thousands of years, attracting both locals and families from small outlying villages to both buy and sell. It is an opportunity for many to socialize with distant neighbors. Market day begins very early for both residents and those who travel to the town to sell.&lt;ref name="ipn"/&gt; Many products such as plants, flowers, fruit, [[lime (material)|lime]] for tortillas, live animals, fabric, ceramics, baskets, knives, saddles, hats, rope, [[alebrije]]s, traditional footwear and drinks such as [[mezcal]] and tejate.&lt;ref name="ipn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; Many of the products are the crafts produced by other towns in the Central Valleys region of Oaxaca, such as  textiles of [[Jalietza]], and [[San Antonino Castillo Velasco]] and the alebrijes of [[San Martín Tilcajete]].&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; Prepared regional specialties are also offered here and the adjacent permanent municipal market. Some of the traditional foods here include several types of [[mole (sauce)|mole]] (negro, rojo, Amarillo, coloradito and more), chichilo, [[tasajo]], tamales in banana leaves and tacos with [[chapulines]] (fried grasshoppers). Another favorite is ice cream in flavors such as nut, [[opuntia|cactus fruit]], [[guanabana]], [[horchata]] and others. Sweet breads such as "mamones" "rosquitas" "marquezotes" and coconut tortillas are popular as well.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt; Most of the food products are locally made, including chapulines, animal crackers made with piloncillo and ice cream.&lt;ref name="ipn"/&gt; 

The eighth campus of the Nova Universitas University, part of the SUNEO system, was inaugurated by Oaxaca governor [[Ulises Ruiz Ortiz]] in the city. The college focuses on providing educational opportunities to indigenous populations. Professors give classes both in person at the campus and provide distance learning through big screens in remote classrooms with special monitors to allow student-teacher dialogue. The distance learning scheme allows students in Ocotlan to study with professors from other parts of the state and even attend classes offered in foreign countries. The first degrees offered are Computer Science and Agricultural Science. The school also offered adult and remedial education.&lt;ref name="puso"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nova"&gt;{{cite press release |title= Inauguró Ulises Ruiz campus Nova Universitas de Ocotlán de Morelos |publisher=State of Oaxaca |date=February 10, 2010 |url= http://www.oaxacacomunicacionsocial.gob.mx/prensa/1-comunicados/215-inauguro-ulises-ruiz-campus-nova-universitas-de-ocotlan-de-morelos- |language=Spanish |trans-title=Ulises Ruiz inaugurates Nova Universitas campus of Ocotlan de Morelos |accessdate=April 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has a [[tuna (music)|tuna ensemble]] called the "Tuna Universitaria Santo Domingo de Guzman." This group organizes recitals such as the one in December 2009 for Christmas, inviting other tuna ensembles. The ensemble was founded in 1978 with the objective of preserving the music and traditions associated with the musical style and receives funding from Oaxaca state as well as from private sources.&lt;ref name="tuna"&gt;{{cite news |title= Recital navideño en Ocotlán de Morelos |first= Edgar |last= Leyva |url= http://www.diariodespertar.com.mx/cultura/25389-Recital-navideo-Ocotln-Morelos.html |newspaper= Diario Despertar |location=Oaxaca |date=December 24, 2009 |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Christmas recital in Ocotlan de Morelos }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts and handcrafts==

===Rodolfo Morales===
[[File:MorelosShrineOcotlanMonastery.JPG|thumb|150px|Shrine to Morales at entrance to museum/monastery]]
The town is intimately linked with the life of painter Rodolfo Morales. He has depicted it in his works and has worked to save many of its historic and architectural treasures.&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt; The artist's work is devoted to images from this hometown, including local churches, indigenous women, religious procession and others.&lt;ref name="inconforme"&gt;{{cite news |title= Grandes Maestros del Siglo 20 / Rodolfo Morales: De mirada inconforme |newspaper=El Norte |location=Monterrey, Mexico |date=May 11, 2003 |page=3 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Great Masters of the 20th Century/Rodolfo Morales:From a non-conformist's perspective }}&lt;/ref&gt; Art critic Julio Cesar Schara states that Ocotlan is a down without grace or major heroes but Morales reinvented the area with his own imagination, painting Neoclassic palaces, angels, fairies to express how he felt about the place.&lt;ref name="reinventa"&gt;{{cite news |title=Evocan 26 artistas el Ocotlan de Morales |first=Omar |last=Garcia |newspaper=Reforma |location= Mexico City |date=May 8, 2002 |page=4 |language=Spanish |trans-title=26 Artists evoke Ocotlan del Morales }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his last works called "Mercados" depicts market scenes from the town painted on columns.&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt;

Rodolfo Morales’ career as an artist developed in fits and starts.&lt;ref name="inconforme"/&gt; In the 1950s, Morales was commissioned to do the mural work in the municipal palace of Ocotlan, painting it with historical and current scenes related to the municipality. Much of this mural work shows similarities to mural work done by Diego Rivera.&lt;ref name="delcampo"&gt;{{cite news |title= ENTRE PARÉNTESIS / ¿Morelos o Morales? |first=David |last= Martin del Campo |newspaper=Reforma |location= Mexico City |date=April 15, 2008 |page=9 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Between parenthesis/Morelos or Morales? }}&lt;/ref&gt; From that time to the 1970s, Morales remained in obscurity, teaching art privately and for a [[UNAM]] affiliated preparatory school. In the 1970s, his work was discovered by Mexican painter [[Rufino Tamayo]], when Morales was in his 50s.&lt;ref name="inconforme"/&gt; This later work was more surreal than that of the mural he painted when he was younger.&lt;ref name="delcampo"/&gt;  From the time of his discovery by Tamayo until 1986, Morales continued to work at the preparatory school even though his work was being sold in Europe, Mexico and the United States.&lt;ref name="inconforme"/&gt;&lt;ref name="delcampo"/&gt; In 1986, Morales retired from teaching to paint full-time. The production from this time period brought him fame and fortune, allowing him to sponsor civic projects in his hometown.&lt;ref name="delcampo"/&gt; In 1992, he established the Rodolfo Morales Foundation dedicated to fomenting the culture of Oaxaca and supporting the youth of Ocotlan. The artist died in 2001.&lt;ref name="inconforme"/&gt; Much of the restoration work in the monastery and church were done by Morales himself, including feminizing the angels and making the faces more solemn.&lt;ref name="delcampo"/&gt;
While Morales is Ocotlán's best known creative mind, the town has been associated with crafts for generations. Some of the crafts still practiced here include basketry, textiles in the form of [[rebozo]]s and other traditional clothing embroidered in silk thread, blade making, saddlemaking and miniatures in lead. The town is known for its red clay pottery, which is often painted in various colors.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt; Octolan is part of a stretch of road on which are a number of crafts towns such as San Bartolo Coyotepec, San Martin Tilcajete, Santo Tomás Jlietza and Santa Ana Zegache.&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt;

[[File:MujerNiñoMEAPO.JPG|thumb|150px|"Mujer con Niño" by Guillermina Aguilar Alcantara at [[San Bartolo Coyotepec|the MEAPO Museum]].]]

===Crafts and artisans===
While the men dominate the rug-weaving and woodcarving industries in Oaxaca, the women reign with their pottery. This is true in Ocotlan as well.&lt;ref name="avazquez"&gt;{{cite news |title=Women in Oaxaca, Mexico, Find Strength through Pottery |first=A. |last=Vazquez |author2= Dai Huynh |newspaper=Knight Ridder Tribune Business New |location= Washington, D.C. |date=December 2, 2002 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The best known pottery family in Ocotlan is the Aguilar. The dynasty begins with potter Isaura Alcantara Diaz, a potter. Isaura learned the traditional pottery making techniques of the Oaxaca Valley, which was mostly limited to making utilitarian items. She began to experiment with figures and more decorative pieces, with some of her pieces making their way into the Rockefeller collection, but died prematurely at the age of 44. Before she died, she taught potting to her children Josefina, Guillermina, Irene, Concepción and Jesús. Due to their mother's death, the children began working early, with Josefina being only seven. Poverty prevented the children from attending school. Like their mother, they began and mostly made pots and other kitchen utensils but they also worked to develop clay figures.&lt;ref name="lcastillo"/&gt; Over time, these siblings became renowned for their fanciful painted clay figures that celebrate everyday life.&lt;ref name="avazquez"/&gt; Today, these siblings still work and much of the third generation are craftsmen as well. Some, such as Demetrio Garcia Aguilar, are making a name for themselves as well.&lt;ref name="lcastillo"/&gt;

[[Josefina Aguilar]] has been noted for her ceramic work since 1977 when she won the third Premio Nacional de Arte (National Art Prize) in 1977. Later, she would win statewide and other nationwide honors and would show her work internationally in places such as the United States and Europe, and her work can be found around the world.&lt;ref name="lcastillo"/&gt; Guillermina Aguilar Alcantara is known for her nativity scenes, wedding scenes, candle sticks and other works done in clay. She and her sister Irene have also won a number of awards and has exported her wears to over a dozen countries. Much of this exporting success was due to a grant by Fomento Cultural Banamex which allowed the family operation to purchase shipping equipment.&lt;ref name="cptm"&gt;{{cite news |title=Nombra el CPTM a los embajadores de la Marca México |first=Carlos |last=Velazquez Mayoral |newspaper=Economista |location= Mexico City |date=September 15, 2005 |page= |language=Spanish |trans-title=CPTM names ambassadors for the Mexico Brand }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EtchedBladeAguilar.JPG|thumb|125px|left|[[Apolinar Aguilar Velasco]] and one of his blades]]
Another known craftsman is Angel Aguilar, who is known for making knives, swords, machetes and the like using the same techniques as those used in the 16th century. Aguilar began making blades when he was ten, taught by his father and uncle. He is now teaching the craft to the next generation.&lt;ref name="palehorse"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://palehorsemex.blogspot.com/2006/12/ocotlan-de-morelos-mexico-steel-worked.html |title=Ocotlan de Morelos, Mexico: Steel worked as in 16th century Toledo, Spain |accessdate=April 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The municipality==
As municipal seat, the city of Ocotlán de Morelos is the government authorities for about forty other localities with the most populous outside the seat being Praxedis de Guerrero (1530), San Pedro Guegorexe (813) and Tejas de Morelos (688). However, over seventy percent of the municipality's population of 19,581 lives in the city proper.&lt;ref name="INEGI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ |title=INEGI Census 2005 |language=Spanish |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EjXaEdST?url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ |archivedate=February 27, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The municipality borders the municipalities of [[Santa Ana Zegache]], [[San Martín Tilcajete]], [[San Juan Chilateca]], [[San Antonino Castillo Velasco]], [[Santiago Apóstol]], [[Ejutla de Crespo]], [[Santa Catarina Minas]], [[San Dionisio Ocotlán]], [[San Pedro Mártir, Oaxaca|San Pedro Mártir]], [[Asunción Ocotlán]], [[San Pedro Apóstol]], [[Magdalena Ocotlán]], [[Santa Inés Yatzeche]] and [[Santa Gertrudis (municipality)|Santa Gertrudis]].&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

The territory's geography varies from mountains to flat valley area with some rolling hills. Principle elevations include Yavitise, and Guevexco which are part of the mountain region located to the east and Santa Catarina Minas and San Miguel Tilquiapam to the west. The main surface water is the Ocotlan River, which is a tributary of the [[Atoyac River (Oaxaca)|Atoyac.]] Other rivers include the Chilana, Santa Rosa, Rio Grande, Riod Chichicapan, San Pablo, Taviche, Atoyac, Guanibay, Rio Bravo, La Garzona, Del Panteon and Paraiso. In addition there are intermittent streams that principally flow during the rainy season. The climate is temperate with some variation in temperature during the year and a moderate rainy season in the summer and early autumn. Most of the municipality's flora and fauna has been disturbed by man, with flat areas converted into farmland or settlements. Forests of pine and ocote still exist in the higher elevations.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

There are deposits of gold, silver, iron, coal, lead, copper, zinc, [[antimony]], [[titanium]], [[asbestos]] and other minerals.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

Most of the population is involved in agriculture (23%), crafts and manufacturing (28%) and commerce (45%). One major crop is the [[castor oil plant]], along with corn, beans and various fruit trees. Livestock includes cattle, pigs, goats and domestic fowl. There is a processing plant which makes vegetable oil, with mezcal and dairy products produced in small workshops. Crafts include textiles and ceramics. Most working in commerce has small family businesses.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

The municipality of Ocotlan de Morelos has 8 municipal agencies of Buenavista, Praxedis de Guerrero, [[Texas De Morelos]], San Cristóbal Ixcatlán, San Felipe Apóstol, [[San Jacinto Chilateca]], San Jacinto Ocotlán, and San Pedro Guegorexe. also has 5 Police Agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/enciclopedia/EMM20oaxaca/municipios/20068a.html|title=OAXACA - Ocotlán de Morelos|website=www.inafed.gob.mx|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Student from UNY reading short story by Evi Idawati 2015-06-08 06.jpg|thumb|A student of [[Yogyakarta State University]] performing a dramatic reading of a short story]]
'''Oral Interpretation''' is a dramatic art, also commonly called "interpretive reading" and "dramatic reading", though these terms are more conservative and restrictive.  In certain applications, oral interpretation is also a theatre art – as in reader's theatre, in which a work of literature is performed with manuscripts in hand or, more traditionally, using stools and music stands; and especially chamber theatre, which dispenses with manuscripts and uses what may be described as essentialist costuming and stage lighting, and suggestive scenery.

The term is succinctly defined by [[Paul Campbel]]l (''The Speaking and Speakers of Literature''; Dickinson, 1967) as the "oralization of literature"; or more eloquently, if less intelligibly, by Charlotte Lee and Timothy Gura (''Oral Interpretation''; Houghton-Mifflin, 1997) as "the art of communicating to an audience a work of literary art in its intellectual, emotional, and aesthetic entirety".  Historically essential to Charlotte Lee's definition of oral interpretation is the fact the performer is "reading from a manuscript".  This perspective, once the majority view, has long since become the minority opinion on the question; so that whether one is or is not reading from a manuscript, the art retains the same name.

Voice and movement technique is ''opsis'' ("spectacle") while oral interpretation is, conceptually, ''melopoiia'' ("music technique").

Because oral interpretation is an essential dramatic element in all performance art (even dance, in which the oral element is most typically a silent element), all actors, singers, storytellers, etc., are ''interpreters'' – but not all interpreters are necessarily actors, or singers, or storytellers, and so on.  When, for example, the writer [[David Sedaris]] reads one of his stories on stage, or when [[Leonard Cohen]] performs one of his lyric poems, they are both engaged in the art of oral interpretation.  But Sedaris is no actor, and even Cohen himself would say that ''he'' is no singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cohencentric.com/2015/06/22/rarely-viewed-video-leonard-cohen-on-his-atrocious-voice-dylan-lead-belly-ice-t-songwriting-love-wheres-the-beef/|title=1992 Video: Leonard Cohen On His Atrocious Voice, Dylan, Ice-T, Songwriting, Love &amp; Where's The Beef|date=22 June 2015|work=cohencentric.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, there is a historic and purely academic argument as to whether oral interpretation and drama/theatre performance are different names for the same thing or whether they are completely different art forms.  This argument is almost exclusively found at colleges and universities whose theatre programs evolved in departments historically or currently called "English and Speech", "Speech and Dramatic Arts" or "Communication and Theatre Arts".  The argument is rarely heard in theatre programs that did not evolve out of English and/or Speech Communication departments, such as those associated with schools/colleges of music.

In high schools across the United States, Oral Interpretation is a very highly valued competition event, particularly in the mid-western states, such as Nebraska, Iowa, and South Dakota.  Students select a work of literature, make a cutting of the literature to fit a time limit of 10 minutes, and perform it in several rounds at tournaments across their state. The piece must be from a published, worthwhile piece of literature, with the exception of Readers Theatre. The categories of said event are as follows:
* Serious Prose—Interpretation of a work of prose literature with a serious basis. Single-person event.
* Humorous Interp—Interpretation of any published work of comedic literature. Single-person event
* Dramatic Interp—Interpretation of a dramatic play with a serious nature. Single-person event.
* Poetry—Interpretation of a published work of poetry. Single-person event.
* Non-Original Oratory—Interpretation of an oratorical speech that has been previously delivered. Single-person event.
* Duo Interpretation—Interpretation of a piece of literature where two Interpers are involved. The pair may not look at nor touch each other, and must deliver the piece in the direction of the audience. This category has the most stringent rules.
* Readers Theatre—A theatrical interpretation performance where 3-6 people participate. They may perform an original piece, or they may take a cutting from a work of literature. This category has the least amount of rules.

A '''''parti pris'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Stevens Curl|title="parti." |work=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=2000|accessdate=May 17, 2009|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O1-parti.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an organizing thought or decision behind an architect's [[design]],  presented in the form of a basic diagram or a simple statement.&lt;ref&gt;Ching, Francis D. K. (1995). A Visual Dictionary of Architecture. Van Nostrand Reinhold Company. p. 53. {{ISBN|0-442-02462-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It may be shortened to "parti". The term comes from 15th century French, in which "parti pris" meant "decision taken." Later, it took on the meaning of "bias" or "prejudice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arch100and110.blogspot.com/2012/11/parti.html|title=An Introduction to Architecture and Visual Communications: parti|first=Blue|last=One|date=21 November 2012|website=Arch100and110.blogspot.com|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term developed in a particularly Euro-centric context of the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France in which the proponents were predominantly white, male and well-to-do.

The development of the parti frequently precedes the development of [[Architectural plan|plan]], [[Architectural drawing#Cross section|section]], and [[Architectural drawing#Elevation|elevation]] diagrams.&lt;ref name=medium&gt;{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/applying-architecture-to-product-design/applying-architecture-to-product-design-parti-68b0b7345db9#.p0d87v6lc |title=Applying Architecture to Product Design: Parti |last1=Mandelbaum |first1=Melissa |website=Medium.com  |access-date=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the fact that it defines the organizing thought prior to research, exploration, collaboration and the development of intentions, the "parti" is a passé approach to architectural design. Critics argue that recent historical attempts to recover the term for contemporary times are conservative and nostalgic for a simpler time. They make the case that parti is a stand in for a formalist approach to architecture that abdicates responsibility and social engagement.

'''Rescue Pets''' are a plush toy series manufactured and marketed by [[MGA Entertainment]]. They are mainly dogs, but can be other animals such as a cat or penguin.  The series was released in 2006 with the first Rescue Pets and Rescue Pets Puppies. Their expressions often make them look sad or pitiful to enhance their cuteness. 

Many of the television spots are produced by Image Line Media.

Some Rescue Pets, known as "MyePets", include a secret code that can be entered online, enabling those who buy the toys to play games and take care of their pets online at the MyePets site [http://www.myepets.com]. You can visit several locations including the Spa, the Flea Market, the Vet, the Diner, the Arcade, the pet show, the park and the user's house. MyePets are very similar to [[Webkinz]] in many ways. There also is an amusement park in construction. It was said to reopen in September 2010, but the promise never came through.

There was also a Unity-programmed version of the game called Myepets 3D, which works similar to the EarthBound series, in which the player's pets can use physical and psychic attacks, buy weapons and armour and fight enemies and bosses.

Both virtual worlds were shut down in 2011-2012 so MGA could dedicate to its other active brands.

There is also a Rescue Pets "Swim To Me" puppy. It is made out of plastic, and comes complete with goggles and towel. It swims in water, and walks on land. It has received mixed reviews.[http://www.target.com/Rescue-Pets-Swim-Me-Puppy/dp/B0018QQQEO]

The '''Rolf Schock Prizes''' were established and endowed by bequest of philosopher and artist [[Rolf Schock]] (1933–1986). The prizes were first awarded in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, in 1993, and since 2005 are awarded every three years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rolfschockprizes.se/engelskasidor/home/theprize.9_en.html&lt;/ref&gt; Each recipient currently receives [[Swedish krona|SEK]] 400,000 (''ca.'' [[United States dollar|US$]] 60,000). A similar prize is the [[Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy]], established by the [[Inamori Foundation]].

The Prizes are awarded in four categories and decided by committees of three of the [[Swedish Royal Academies]]:

*[[Logic]] and [[Philosophy]] (decided by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]])
*[[Mathematics]] (decided by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]])
*[[Visual art|Visual Arts]] (decided by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Arts]])
*[[Music|Musical Arts]] (decided by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Music]])

The '''Royal Danish Theatre''' ('''RDT''', [[Danish language|Danish]]: '''''{{lang|da|Det Kongelige Teater}}''''') is both the national Danish performing arts institution and a name used to refer to its old purpose-built venue from 1874 located on [[Kongens Nytorv]] in [[Copenhagen]]. The theatre was founded in 1748, first serving as the theatre of the king, and then as the theatre of the country. The theatre presents [[opera]], the [[Royal Danish Ballet]], [[European classical music|classical music]] concerts (by the [[Royal Danish Orchestra]], which dates back to 1448), and [[drama]] in several locations.

The Royal Danish Theatre organization is under the control of the [[Danish Ministry of Culture]], and its objectives are to ensure the staging of outstanding performances that do justice to the various stages which it controls.

==Performing arts venues==
* The '''Old Stage''' is the original Royal Danish Theatre built in 1874.
* The '''[[Copenhagen Opera House]]''' '''''(Operaen)''''', built in 2004.
* '''[[Stærekassen]]''' is an [[Art Deco]] theatre adjacent to the main theatre. It is used for drama productions.
* [[Royal Danish Playhouse]] is a venue for "spoken theatre" with three stages, inaugurated in 2008.

==Cultural references==

'''Rybon Art Center''' is an international, independent and artist-led institute based in [[Tehran]]. It was established in 2008 in order to encourage artistic innovations and experimentations among local artists and also explore possible exchange of ideas and knowledge in the field of [[contemporary]] critical art of [[Iran]] beyond ethnic and regional boundaries. During these years Rybon has initiated and conducted numerous projects including [[Artist residency|art residencies]], local and international artist [[workshops]], art shares and artist talks, screenings, enhancing local art networks and facilitating international art exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rybonartcenter.com|title=Rybon Art Center Official Website|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.art21.org/newyorkcloseup/2015/07/11/if-you-happen-to-be-in-tehran|title=Screening of "New York Close Up" in  Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art|website=ART21 New York Close Up|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.honaronline.ir/pages/news-59161.aspx|title=هفته فیلم ˝نیویورک نمای نزدیک˝ در موزه هنرهای معاصر|website=www.honaronline.ir|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rybondoc.com/global/index/section/guest/module/news/lang/fa/catid/0/id/2268/page/19|title="From Experimental Film to Video Art" Workshop|last=|first=|website=www.rybondoc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the history of art residency in the world, in early years of Rybon’s activity this form of art exchange did not have a serious professional background in Iran. Therefore, Rybon from the very beginning concentrated on different forms of art residency which facilitated dialogue and exchange of ideas among artists in Iran.

Rybon started its first residency projects in collaboration with local artistic and cultural institutes, inviting established artists from neighboring countries. Holding Rybon International Artists’ Workshop based on [[Triangle Arts Trust|Triangle]] workshops in 2012 in collaboration with Mohsen Gallery and Darbast Platform in Tehran was another step toward establishing residency culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gasworks.org.uk/triangle-network/partners/rybon|title=Triangle Network {{!}} Gasworks|website=www.gasworks.org.uk|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://universes-in-universe.org/eng/nafas/articles/2012/rybon_workshop|title=a Review about 1st Rybon International Artists Workshop at Nafas Art Magazine|last=|first=|website=universes-in-universe.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.frieze.com/postcard-from-tehran|title="Postcard from Tehran" an Article by Daria Kirsanova at frieze blog|last=|first=|website=blog.frieze.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Impediments for holding international residencies lead to devising a new form of residency, namely exchange programs, by Rybon. The first of these exchange programs was held in 2013 in collaboration with Organhaus Art Space of [[China]] and Mohsen Gallery in Tehran and [[Chongqing]], China. At the present the “Exchange Program” is being successfully practiced as a pivotal part of [[Kooshk Residency]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.organhaus.com/20141.html|title=Exchange Program (Iran-China) {{!}} Organhaus Art Space|website=器 .

Rybon organised the Second Rybon International Artists's Workshop in 2016 based on Triangle workshops in collaboration with Kooshk Residency, deegar platform and Gasworks. This program aimed to gather artists from all around the world to discuss and look for the possibilities to exchange ideas and knowledge beyond the ethnic, regional and artistic boundaries. Five Asian, European and African artists as well as five Iranian artists participated in this program. The program started on November 10 and lasted until November 25th.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://engarmag.com/8468/|title=رای‌بُن، جشن بیکران|date=2016-12-13|newspaper=انگار|language=fa-IR|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arabculturefund.org/bulletin/article.php?genre=2&amp;id=834#.WE-AqrV4GEc|title=AFAC :: BULLETIN|website=www.arabculturefund.org|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gasworks.org.uk/triangle-network/blog/|title=Triangle Network Blog {{!}} Gasworks|website=www.gasworks.org.uk|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rybonartcenter.com/sn/workshop/pt/full/catId/2/id/18|title=Rybon Art Center {{!}} مرکز هنری رای ُبن {{!}} Workshop {{!}} International {{!}} Second Rybon International Artists' Workshop|last=http://www.persiantools.com|first=PersianTools. {{!}}|website=www.rybonartcenter.com|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kooshkresidency.com/program/second-rybon-international-artists-workshop/|title=The Second Rybon International Artists' Workshop - Kooshk Residency|newspaper=Kooshk Residency|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1153">'''Soros Realism''' is a term coined by [[Miško Šuvaković]] in "Ideologija izložbe: o ideologijama Manifeste" (2002) describing a type of [[post-socialist art]] financed by American Businessman of Hungarian origin [[George Soros]], who has financed number of Soros centers for contemporary art the Eastern Europe.

Although it was not originally used pejoratively by Šuvaković, because of its reverberation of the very name of [[Socialist Realism|Socialistic Realism]], a style of socialist propaganda in painting and sculpture, it has staid an irony of a renewed political funding of art, that censors by financing not forbidding.

[[File:Madonna di stalingrado 02.JPG|thumb|upright 1.32|''Stalingrad Madonna'', Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche, Berlin]]
The '''''Stalingrad Madonna''''' ({{lang-de|Stalingradmadonna}}) is an image of the [[Virgin Mary]] drawn by a German soldier, Kurt Reuber, in 1942 in [[Stalingrad]] (now [[Volgograd]]), [[Russia]], during the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. The original is displayed in the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]], Berlin, while copies now hang in the cathedrals of [[Berlin Cathedral|Berlin]], [[Coventry Cathedral|Coventry]] and {{ill|Kazan Cathedral, Volgograd|ru|Казанский собор (Волгоград)}} as a sign of the reconciliation between [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]] and Russia, which were enemies during the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref name="Perry7"&gt;Perry, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The piece is a simple [[charcoal]] sketch, measuring three feet by four feet {{nowrap|(900 mm × 1200 mm)}}. [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] is depicted wrapped in a large shawl, holding the infant [[Jesus]] close to her cheek. On the right border are the words ''Licht, Leben, Liebe'' ("Light, Life, Love"), from the [[Gospel of John]]. On the left, Reuber wrote ''Weihnachten im Kessel 1942'' ("[[Christmas]] at the Siege 1942") and at the bottom ''Festung Stalingrad'' ("Fortress Stalingrad"). ''Kessel'' ("Cauldron"), is the German term for an encircled military area, and Fortress Stalingrad was the label for the encircled army promoted in the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] press.&lt;ref name="Feldgrau"&gt;[http://www.feldgrau.com/articles.php?ID=74 Feldgrau.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The picture was drawn by Lieutenant Kurt Reuber, a German staff [[physician]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[pastor]], in December 1942 during the [[Battle of Stalingrad]].&lt;ref name="Perry7"/&gt; Reuber wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;I wondered for a long while what I should paint, and in the end I decided on a Madonna, or mother and child. I have turned my hole in the frozen mud into a studio. The space is too small for me to be able to see the picture properly, so I climb on to a stool and look down at it from above, to get the perspective right. Everything is repeatedly knocked over, and my pencils vanish into the mud. There is nothing to lean my big picture of the madonna against, except a sloping, home-made table past which I can just manage to squeeze. There are no proper materials and I have used a Russian map for paper. But I wish I could tell you how absorbed I have been painting my madonna, and how much it means to me."&lt;br&gt;"The picture looks like this: the mother's head and the child's lean toward each other, and a large cloak enfolds them both. It is intended to symbolize 'security' and 'mother love.' I remembered the words of St.John: light, life, and love. What more can I add? I wanted to suggest these three things in the homely and common vision of a mother with her child and the security that they represent.&lt;ref name="Feldgrau"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; He added that he:&lt;blockquote&gt;went to all the bunkers, brought my drawing to the men, and chatted with them.  How they sat there!  Like being in their dear homes with mother for the holiday.&lt;ref name="Feldgrau"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Later, Reuber hung the drawing in his [[bunker]] for his unit celebration, which he described as a moment of [[Christian]] devotion shared by all the soldiers in his command. &lt;blockquote&gt;When according to ancient custom I opened the Christmas door, the slatted door of our bunker, and the comrades went in, they stood as if entranced, devout and too moved to speak in front of the picture on the clay wall...The entire celebration took place under the influence of the picture, and they thoughtfully read the words: light, life, love...Whether commander or simple soldier, the Madonna was always an object of outward and inward contemplation.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Madonna'' was flown out of Stalingrad by Dr Wilhelm Grosse, his [[battalion]] commander of the [[16th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|16th Panzer Division]] on the last [[transport plane]] to leave the encircled German [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|6th Army]].&lt;ref name="Perry7"/&gt; Reuber was taken captive after the surrender of the 6th Army, and died in a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[prisoner of war]] camp in 1944.&lt;ref name="Feldgrau"/&gt; The ''Madonna'' and a number of letters from Reuber were delivered to his family. There they remained, until German Federal President [[Karl Carstens]] encouraged Reuber's surviving children to donate the work to the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] in [[Berlin]]. Springer, Reuber's three children and [[Louis Ferdinand, Prince of Prussia|Prince Louis Ferdinand]] (in his role as chair of the Memorial Church board of trustees) attended the dedication ceremony in August 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The drawing and Reuber's letters were published shortly after the war, and Navy chaplain Arno Pötzsch wrote an apologetic book of poetry entitled ''The Madonna of Stalingrad'' in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The work became a powerful symbol of peace in the [[Cold War]] era, as well as part of the mythologising of Stalingrad and the events of the Second World War in German society.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Copies were presented, and are displayed, in the cathedrals of [[Volgograd]] (formerly Stalingrad), Berlin, and [[Coventry]] as a symbol of reconciliation. Similarly a [[Coventry Cathedral#The Charred Cross and the Cross of Nails|Cross of Nails]] from Coventry is displayed with the ''Madonna'' in the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church.

==''The Prisoners' Madonna''==
Reuber painted a second similar picture in captivity around Christmas 1943. He was by this time in a prisoner of war camp in [[Yelabuga]], some 1,000 kilometres north-east of Stalingrad, and the painting was made for the prisoners' newspaper. He titled it ''The Prisoners' Madonna''. Reuber did not live to see another Christmas, dying of illness a few weeks later on 20 January 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''stone circles''' of the [[Iron Age]] (c. 500 BC &amp;ndash; c. 400 AD) were a characteristic burial custom of southern Scandinavia, especially on [[Gotland]] and in [[Götaland]] during the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]] and the [[Roman Iron Age]]. In Sweden, they are called '''Domarringar''' (judge circles), '''Domkretsar''' (judge circles) or '''Domarsäten''' (judge seats). They should not be confused with the [[Stone circle]]s of the [[Bronze Age]] and [[Prehistoric Britain|Britain]].

== History ==
[[Image:Wesiory.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A stone circle in the area of northern [[Poland]]  where the [[Goth]]s initially settled after emigration from [[Scandza]].]]

A tradition of making stone circles existed on the European continent in [[Wielbark culture]] near the mouth of the [[Vistula River]] in the first century. The practice suggests Norse influence but may have been established in the area before the arrival of the [[Goths]].

The stone circles were sometimes used as burial grounds.

== Shapes ==
The circles are usually round, or elongated [[ellipse]]s. The stones may be very large and they are usually between 9 and 12. Sometimes there are as few as 6&amp;ndash;8. One stone circle, the circle of Nässja (near [[Vadstena]]), comprises as many as 24 stones. Excavations have shown burnt coal in the centre of the circles and they are nowadays considered to be incineration graves.

==Things==
There is a widespread tradition that the circles were used for [[Thing (assembly)|thing]]s, or general assemblies. Similar circles were used for popular assemblies in Denmark until the 16th century, and in Vad parish in [[Västergötland]], the village assemblies were held in a stone circle until the 19th century.

==Snorri Sturluson==
Even if knowledge that the stone circles were graves was later lost, it was still fresh in the 13th century as testify these lines by [[Snorri Sturluson]] in the introduction of the [[Heimskringla]]:
{{quote|As to funeral rites, the earliest age is called the Age of Burning; because all the dead were consumed by fire, and over their ashes were raised standing stones.|[[Heimskringla]] by [[Snorri Sturluson]]}}

'''''Sunflowers''''' (original title, in French: '''''Tournesols''''') is the name of two [[serial imagery|series]] of [[still life]] paintings by the Dutch painter [[Vincent van Gogh]]. The first series, executed in Paris in 1887, depicts the flowers lying on the ground, while the second set, executed a year later in [[Arles]], shows a bouquet of sunflowers in a vase. In the artist's mind both sets were linked by the name of his friend [[Paul Gauguin]], who acquired two of the Paris versions. About eight months later van Gogh hoped to welcome and to impress Gauguin again with ''Sunflowers'', now part of the painted ''[[Décoration for the Yellow House]]'' that he prepared for the guestroom of his home in Arles, where Gauguin was supposed to stay. After Gauguin's departure, van Gogh imagined the two major versions as wings of the ''Berceuse Triptych'', and finally he included them in his [[Vincent van Gogh's display at Les XX, 1890|Les XX in Bruxelles exhibit]].

== The Paris ''Sunflowers'' ==
{{See also|Still life paintings by Vincent van Gogh (Paris)}}
Little is known of Van Gogh's activities during the two years he lived with his brother, Theo, in Paris, 1886–1888. The fact that he had painted ''Sunflowers'' already is only revealed in the spring of 1889, when Gauguin claimed one of the Arles versions in exchange for studies he had left behind after leaving Arles for Paris. Van Gogh was upset and replied that Gauguin had absolutely no right to make this request: "I am definitely keeping my sunflowers in question. He has two of them already, let that hold him. And if he is not satisfied with the exchange he has made with me, he can take back his little Martinique canvas, and his self-portrait sent me from Brittany,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Wildenstein&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time giving me back both my portrait&lt;ref&gt;Selfportrait ''à l'ami Gauguin''&lt;/ref&gt; and the two sunflower canvases which he has taken to Paris. So if he ever broaches this subject again, I've told you just how matters stand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/19/571.htm|title=Letter 571 - Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh : 17 January 1889|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two ''Sunflowers'' in question show two buttons each; one of them was preceded by a small study, and a fourth large canvas combines both compositions.

These were Van Gogh's first paintings with ''"nothing but sunflowers"''—yet, he had already included sunflowers in still life and landscape earlier.

== The Arles ''Sunflowers'' ==
In a letter to [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], dating from 21 or 22 August 1888, Vincent wrote: "I'm painting with the gusto of a Marseillais eating [[bouillabaisse]], which won’t surprise you when it's a question of painting large sunflowers." At this time he had three paintings on the go, and intended to do more; as he explained to his brother: "in the hope of living in a studio of our own with Gauguin, I'd like to do a decoration for the studio. Nothing but large sunflowers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let666/letter.html Letter 666] To Theo van Gogh. Arles, Tuesday, 21 or Wednesday, 22 August 1888.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaving aside the first two versions, all Arlesian ''Sunflowers'' are painted on [[French standard sizes for oil paintings|size 30 canvases]].

=== The initial versions, August 1888 ===
None meets the descriptions supplied by van Gogh himself in his announcement of the series in every detail. The first version differs in size, is painted on a size 20 canvas—not on a size 15 canvas as indicated&lt;ref&gt;Dorn 1990, pp. 336–337&lt;/ref&gt;—and all the others differ in the number of flowers depicted from van Gogh's announcement. The second was evidently enlarged and the initial composition altered by insertion of the two flowers lying in the foreground, center and right.&lt;ref&gt;Dorn 1990, pp. 344–348&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the third nor the fourth shows the dozen or 14 flowers indicated by the artist, but more—fifteen or sixteen.&lt;ref&gt;Dorn 1990, pp. 337–340; 340–343 and Van Tilborgh &amp; Hendricks, pp.&lt;/ref&gt;
These alterations are executed ''wet-in-wet'' and therefore considered genuine rework—even the more so as they are copied to the ''repetitions'' of January 1889; there is no longer a trace of later alterations, at least in this aspect.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== The ''Repetitions'', January 1889 ===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Both ''repetitions'' of the 4th version are no longer in their original state. In the Amsterdam version a strip of wood was added at the top—probably by van Gogh himself. The Tokyo version, however, was enlarged on all sides with strips of canvas, which were added at a later time—presumably by the first owner, [[Émile Schuffenecker]].&lt;ref&gt;See Dorn 1999, pp.&lt;/ref&gt; The series is perhaps van Gogh's best known and most widely reproduced.

[[File:Vincent van Gogh - Sunflowers Berceuse triptych - letter.jpg|thumb|Sketch of the triptych in a letter to Theo]]
In January 1889, when Vincent had just finished the first repetitions of the ''Berceuse'' and the ''Sunflowers'' pendants, he told Theo: "I picture to myself these same canvases between those of the sunflowers, which would thus form torches or candelabra beside them, the same size, and so the whole would be composed of seven or nine canvases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/19/574.htm|title=Letter 574 – Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh : 28 January 1889|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A definite hint for the arrangement of the triptych is supplied by Van Gogh's sketch in a letter of July 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/592.htm|title=Letter 592 – Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh : 22 May 1889|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Vincent selected both versions for his display at Les XX, 1890.

[[File:Paul Gauguin - Vincent van Gogh painting sunflowers - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Paul Gauguin: ''[[The Painter of Sunflowers]]'', 1888]]
Van Gogh began painting in late summer 1888 and continued into the following year. One went to decorate his friend [[Paul Gauguin]]'s bedroom. The paintings show sunflowers in all stages of life, from full bloom to withering. The paintings were considered innovative for their use of the yellow spectrum, partly because newly invented [[pigment]]s made new colours possible.

In a letter to Theo,&lt;ref&gt;Letter [http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/19/573.htm 573]&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"It's a type of painting that changes its aspect a little, which grows in richness the more you look at it. Besides, you know that Gauguin likes them extraordinarily. He said to me about them, among other things:
‘that — ... that's... the flower’. You know that [[Georges Jeannin|Jeannin]] has the peony, [[Ernest Quost|Quost]] has the hollyhock, but I have the sunflower, in a way."&lt;ref&gt;[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let741/letter.html Letter 741] To Theo van Gogh. Arles, Tuesday, 22 January 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Schiele - Welke Sonnenblume.jpg|thumb|upright|''Dried Sunflowers'' by [[Egon Schiele]].]]

On March 30, 1987, Japanese insurance magnate Yasuo Goto paid the equivalent of US $39,921,750 for van Gogh's ''Still Life: Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers'' at auction at [[Christie's]] London, at the time a [[List of most expensive paintings|record-setting amount for a work of art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Clines |first=Francis X. |title= Van Gogh Sets Auction Record: $39.9 million |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=1987-03-31 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DB1F3DF932A05750C0A961948260 |accessdate=2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The price was over four times the previous record of about $12{{nbsp}}million paid for [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Mantegna)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' in 1985. The record was broken a few months later with the purchase of another Van Gogh, ''[[Irises (painting)|Irises]]'', by [[Alan Bond (businessman)|Alan Bond]] for $53.9{{nbsp}}million at [[Sotheby's]], New York on November 11, 1987.

While it is uncertain whether Yasuo Goto bought the painting himself or on behalf of his company, the Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Company of Japan, the painting currently resides at Seiji Togo Yasuda Memorial Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo. After the purchase, a controversy arose whether this is a genuine van Gogh or an [[Émile Schuffenecker]] forgery.

=== Provenances ===
Two Paris versions van Gogh exchanged with Gauguin in December 1887 or January 1888, were both sold to [[Ambroise Vollard]]: one in January 1895 and the other in April 1896.  The first canvas resided for a short time with Félix Roux, but was reacquired by [[Vollard]] and sold to [[Degas]], then from his estate to Rosenberg, then to Hahnloser and bequested to the [[Kunstmuseum Bern]]. The second was acquired by the Dutch collector Hoogendijk at the sale of his collection by Kann, who ceded the painting to Richard Bühler and then via Thannhauser to the Metropolitan Museum in New York.

Two of van Gogh's ''Sunflowers'' paintings never left the artist's estate: the study for one of the Paris versions (F377) and the repetition of fourth version (F458). Both are in the possession of the Vincent van Gogh Foundation, established 1962 by Vincent Willem van Gogh, the artist's nephew, and on permanent loan to the [[Van Gogh Museum]], Amsterdam.

Five other versions are recorded in the Van Gogh estate papers:&lt;ref&gt;Dorn 1999 and Stolwijk &amp; Veenenbos 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
*the final Paris version (F.452) in the artist's estate was sold 1909 via C. M. van Gogh, [[The Hague]] (J. H. de Bois) to Kröller-Müller
*(F457) sold 1894 to [[Émile Schuffenecker]]. (Tokyo version).
*(F456) sold 1905 via [[Paul Cassirer]] to [[Hugo von Tschudi]]. (Munich version).
*(F459) sold 1908 C. M. van Gogh (J. H. de Bois), The Hague to Fritz Meyer-Fierz, Zürich (destroyed Japan 1945).
*(F454) sold 1924 via Ernest Brown &amp; Phillips (The [[Leicester Galleries]]) to the [[Tate Gallery]]; since on permanent loan to the [[National Gallery]], London. (London version).

Two Arles versions left the artist's estate unrecorded:
*(F453) (private collection). Sold 1891 to Octave Mirbeau, Paris, (via Tanguy, Paris) for £12 (about £1,300 in 2013 £). Sold 1996 to a private collector for an undisclosed sum.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, 2013, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;
*(F455) (Philadelphia version).

Since 1884, '''The Camera Club of New York''' has been a forum to explore [[photography]]. Though the Club was created by well-to-do 'gentlemen' photography enthusiasts seeking a refuge from the mass popularization of the medium in the 1880s, it accepted its first woman as a member, Miss Elizabeth A. Slade, in 1887, only four years after its inception, and later came to accept new ideas and new approaches to the medium.

Over the years the Club helped launch revolutionary new approaches to photography and nurture many photographers who later became giants in the field. [[Alfred Stieglitz]] used the Club as a forum and venue to convince a still skeptical public that photography was an art worthy of comparison to painting. Later, as the medium matured, the Club was again the place where the new "[[straight photography]]" approach would emerge. [[Paul Strand]], who joined the Camera Club at 17, was introduced to a camera at the Club that had a right-angle viewfinder, allowing one to photograph people unaware. Strand used this camera to produce some of his most memorable images on the streets of New York, including Blind Woman and Wall Street.

[[File:Take our picture please 0085.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Entrance]]
The Camera Club was also an important place to hear about new advances in photography. For instance, X-Ray photography was demonstrated there in 1898 and the [[Autochrome Lumière]] process, an early form of color photography, in 1909. In 1930 [[Willard D Morgan]] first introduced the new [[Leica Camera|Leica]] camera to Club members. Among the important lectures held at the Club were Aero Photography by [[Edward Steichen]] in 1921 and The Life and Work of [[Eugène Atget]] by [[Berenice Abbott]] in 1931. Later, [[Richard Avedon]] lectured on fashion Photography in 1949.

Today, the Camera Club continues to function as an important resource for photography. The club offers classes in basic camera and darkroom skills, which help nurture and create new pioneers of photography and workspaces for established and emerging photographers.  Lectures and exhibits are an important part of the club's program.  Since 1999 such important photographers as [[Eugene Richards]], [[Nigel Parry]], [[Duane Michals]], [[Oliver Weber]], [[Andres Serrano]], [[Eddie Adams (photographer)|Eddie Adams]], and [[Henry Horenstein]] have exhibited and lectured at the club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cameraclubny.org/lecture_series_past.html Past lecture series speakers.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828042926/http://www.cameraclubny.org/lecture_series_past.html |date=2008-08-28 }} Camera Club of New York, 2008. Retrieved August 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Camera Club of New York is located at 126 Baxter Street, New York, NY 10013.

'''''The Last Judgment''''' is a [[triptych]] of disputed authorship, either by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], his workshop, or a collaboration between artist and workshop. It was created after 1486.

The triptych currently resides at the [[Groeningemuseum]] in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]]. The outside of the shutters are painted in [[grisaille]], while the inside shutters and center are oil on panel.

==History==
The work belonged to E. Gravet's collection, and then to that of Seligman, in [[Paris]]. In 1907 it was acquired by  A. Bernaert, who donated it to the city of Bruges. In 1936 it was cleaned and was restored again in 1959. In that occasion, the [[grisaille]] painting of the external shutters were discovered, although damaged. The painting above the internal frames is lost.

The attribution of the work is dubious, due to its mediocre quality.  [[Dendrochronology|Dendrochronologic]] analysis dated it from not before 1486.&lt;ref name="Varallo"&gt;{{cite book |first=Franca |last=Varallo |title=Bosch |publisher=Skira |location=Milan |year=2004 |isbn=978-88-572-0615-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The painting's composition has similarities to [[The Last Judgment (Bosch triptych)|''The Last Judgment'' triptych]] in Vienna and the ''[[Garden of Earthly Delights]]'': both show the Garden of Eden in the left panel and the Hell at right.

Like in other contemporary [[Flemish art|Flemish]] triptychs, the shutters are externally painted in [[grisaille]] with an ''Coronation with Thorns''.

In the central panel is Christ as a judge within a celestial sphere, flanked by angels who are playing the Trumpets of Last Judgement, and by the apostles. Below him is the punishment of sinners which, like the ''Last Judgement'' of Vienna, continues in the Hell depiction at right. At left is the Paradise, where the blessed souls are being shipped to Eden on a boat with a pink tent. The tower is a symbol of the Fountain of Eternal Youth, a more articulate version of which appears in the ''Garden of Delights''.

The central panel is mostly occupied by insect-like demons who torture the men, punishments including burning, eating impure food (the gluttonous) etc., all inspired by [[Netherlandish Proverbs]]. The infernal city at right is under siege by demons, while a fire is visible in  the far background.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4325">'''The Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation''' was founded in 1918 by [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] to operate his estate, [[Laurelton Hall]], in [[Cold Spring Harbor, New York|Cold Spring Harbor]], [[Long Island]]. It was designed to be a summer retreat for artists and craftspeople. In 1946 the estate closed and the foundation changed its purpose from a retreat to the bestowing of grants to artists.

In closing down her father's residence after his death, [[George Frederick Kunz]]' daughter, Ruby Zinsser, donated two paintings by [[Louis C. Tiffany]] to the Tiffany Foundation. "In 1935, the family of George F. Kunz donated two Tiffany paintings to the picture gallery." In this, she was following her father's inclination, since he had previously donated a Syrian bracelet and mineral collection to the Foundation in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Frelinghuysen, Alice Cooney.

'''The Tale of the Shifty Lad, the Widow's Son''' is a Scottish [[fairy tale]] collected by [[John Francis Campbell]] in ''[[Popular Tales of the West Highlands]]''. [[Andrew Lang]] included it, as '''The Shifty Lad''' in ''[[The Lilac Fairy Book]]''.

==Synopsis==
{{plot|date=January 2013}}
A widow wanted her son to learn a trade. He insisted that he wanted to be a thief. She predicted he would end up hanging from a bridge.  One day he did not go to church, and told her that the first trade she heard when she came out would be his. He came to the path and shouted "Thievery" in a disguised voice. She again predicted he would hang from the bridge but gave him to the Black Gallows Bird to learn the trade. The man taught him, and then said they must rob a man who had sold his cattle. On Halloween, they hid in the loft. The shifty lad went down and stirred up the cattle, sending people out; while they were gone, he stole nuts and sewed a leather hide to the thief. He cracked nuts, though the thief warned him he would be heard. He was heard, and the people came, and the thief ran off with the hide still attached. The people said he was stealing the hide and chased him. The Shifty Lad stole the gold and silver while they were gone, and brought them to the thief; they split them.  

Soon, a tenant sent a man to get a wether to give as a wedding gift. The Shifty Lad bet his master that he could steal it from the man's back. When he was coming, the lad put a dirty shoe in his path; the man said that if he had the other one, he would clean this one and have a pair. The Shifty Lad ran ahead of his, and put the shoe in the way again. The man went back to get the other, and the lad took the wether and the shoes and won his bet.  The tenant sent the same man after a kid. The lad bleated like the wether, and when the man searched for it, thinking to come back with both, the lad stole the kid. The third time, the tenant directed him to never let the wether go, and so he brought it home.

The shifty lad had his master hang him, and let him down when he kicked his legs. He praised it, and his master let him hang him, but the lad killed him. His wife was angry, and the lad fled. He took service with a wright who lived next to the king's storehouse, and broke into it to steal. The gifts persuaded the wright and his wife to let him. At the advice of the Seanagal, the king set a hogshead of pitch to catch the thief, and it caught the wright. The lad cut off his head to prevent their learning who he was.

The king displayed the body to discover who grieved at the sight, but when the wright's wife cried out, he cut his foot and pretended she cried over that. Then the body was hung from a tree for the same reason. The lad took a horse with casks of whiskey by them, as if he were hiding from the soldiers. They chased him, and he fled, leaving the horse. They took it back, found the whiskey, and became drunk. The lad took the body. The king sent a black pig about to dig up the body. When it rooted about the wright's house, the lad sent the soldiers inside to eat and drink while it searched. He killed the pig and buried it while they ate. The king sent men to discover where people had pig's flesh they could not account for; the lad killed the soldiers sent to his house, and then started a rumor that the soldiers meant to massacre them, so all the people killed the soldiers.  

The Seanagal advised to give a ball, since the man would be the boldest and dance with the princess; when the lad did so, the Seanagal marked him with a black dot, but the lad saw it and marked the Seanagal himself with two and twenty other men with one. The king decided that he was beaten, and that he wanted so clever a man for his son-in-law. He had all the men with the black dots put in a room, and had a child give one an apple. The lad drew him with a shaving and a drone, and the child gave him the apple. They took the shaving and drone, but the child remembered them and still gave him the apple, so the shifty lad married the princess.  

One day, while they walked on the bridge, the lad told the princess that his mother said he would hang from that bridge. She said that if he wished to go over the wall, she would hold him by her handkerchief. He did, and hanged there, but a cry went up about a fire, startling the princess. She let go. The lad fell and died.

'''Truck art''' is a popular form of regional decoration in [[South Asia]], with [[Pakistan]]i and [[India]]n trucks featuring elaborate floral patterns and calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pakistaniat.com/2008/06/18/pakistans-indigenous-truck-art/ |title=Pakistan’s Indigenous Art of Truck Painting |last1=Mughal |first1=Owais |last2= |first2= |date=June 18, 2008 |website=All Things Pakistan |publisher= |access-date=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativeyatra.com/culture/tracing-truck-art-beyond-horn-ok-please-india-and-pakistans-truck-art-tradition/|title=Tracing Truck Art beyond 'Horn OK Please': India and Pakistan’s Truck Art tradition|date=16 November 2016|publisher=Creative Yatra|language=English|accessdate=31 July 2017|quote=Largely a domestic art in its early years especially in North India and Pakistan, the ideation of beautifying trucks, lorries, and rickshaws with multifaceted patterns and calligraphy was common.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McKenzie2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/india-truck-art-travel-design/index.html|title=Pimp my ride: The psychedelic world of Indian truck art|last=McKenzie|first=Sheena|date=5 August 2015|publisher=[[CNN]]|language=English|accessdate=31 July 2017|quote=For truckers in India, that means a kaleidoscope of colors, slogans, and intricately painted symbols that are as much about bling -- as shrewd business sense. ..."A better looking truck attracts more business," says Shantanu Suman, graphic designer and filmmaker behind 2013 documentary "Horn Please," which explores India's spectacular truck art tradition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistani decorated trucks servicing Afghanistan came to be known as '''jingle trucks''' by American troops and contractors.

=="Jingle truck" origin==
The term jingle truck comes from United States [[military slang]], coined by servicemen in [[Afghanistan]], although it may date to the British colonial period. The term came to be because of the "jingle" sound that the trucks make due to the chains hanging from the bumpers of the vehicles.&lt;ref name=definition&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/citations/jingle_truck_1/ |title=A Way With Words |last=Barrett  |first=Grant  |access-date=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
Many [[truck]]s and [[bus]]es are highly customized and decorated by their owners. External truck decoration can cost thousands of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.amherst.edu/magazine/issues/05spring/trucks/index.html |title=On Wings of Diesel: The Decorated Trucks of Pakistan |last1=Elias |first1=Jamal |last2= |first2= |date=2005 |website=Amherst Magazine |publisher= |access-date=February 10, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517232757/http://www3.amherst.edu/magazine/issues/05spring/trucks/index.html |archivedate=May 17, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decoration often contains elements that remind the truck drivers of home, since they may be away from home for months at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-19292392 |title=Pakistan's truck art inspires catwalk fashion range - BBC News |website=Bbc.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decoration may include structural changes, [[paintings]], [[calligraphy]], and ornamental decor like mirror work on the front and back of vehicles and wooden carvings on the truck doors. Depictions of various historical scenes and poetic verses are also common.&lt;ref name="saudiaramcoworld.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200502/masterpieces.to.go.the.trucks.of.pakistan.htm |title=Masterpieces to Go: The Trucks of Pakistan |last1=Covington |first1=Richard |last2= |first2= |date=Spring 2005 |website=Saudi Aramco World |publisher= |access-date=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outfitting is often completed at a coach workshop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/research/101906.html |title=The Painted Trucks of Pakistan |last1=Nyland |first1=Tim |last2= |first2= |date=October 19, 2006 |website=Penn Current |publisher=University of Pennsylvania |access-date=February 10, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113101127/http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/research/101906.html |archivedate=January 13, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chains and pendants often dangle off the front bumper.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rferl.org/a/truck-art-tradition-in-pakistan/28548217.html Pakistan's Dazzling 'Jingle Trucks'] [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (www.rferl.org).

===Artists===
One of the most prominent truck artists is [[Haider Ali (artist)|Haider Ali]]. Trained by his father from his youth, he first came to international attention in 2002 when he painted an authentic Pakistani truck as part of the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]].&lt;ref name=fastco&gt;{{cite news |last=Hart |first=Hugh |date=14 November 2014 |title=

===Regional styles===
[[File:A road leads to Sharda, Neelum Valley AJK.JPG|thumb|Many local buses in Pakistan are decorated with truck art.]]
In Pakistan, [[Karachi]] is a major city center for truck art, though there are other hubs in [[Rawalpindi]], [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat]], [[Peshawar]], [[Quetta]] and [[Lahore]]. Trucks from [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] and Peshawar are often heavily trimmed with wood, while trucks from Rawalpindi and [[Islamabad]] often feature plastic work. Camel bone ornamentation and predominance of red colours is commonly seen on trucks decorated in [[Sindh]].&lt;ref name="saudiaramcoworld.com"/&gt;

In India, the [[Delhi]]-based artist Tilak Raj Dhir states that the slogans he adds to his truck art, which is prevalent throughout the [[National Capital Region (India)|National Capital Region]], often change with the socio-political atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/meet-the-men-who-convert-trucks-into-colourful-canvases/story-mmF7FbEhGr2FUfpIwqTi1M.html|title=Meet the men who convert trucks into colourful canvases|last=Sharma|first=Manoj|date=20 April 2015|publisher=[[Hindustan Times]]|language=English|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Truck art in Urdu is sometime called Phool Patti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1403009/heritage-saying-it-with-flowers|title=HERITAGE: SAYING IT WITH FLOWERS|publisher=dawn.com|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:Naan_sense_peshawar.jpg|thumb|Truck art decorates the façade of a business in [[Peshawar]], [[Pakistan]].]]
Truck art has extended beyond the decoration and ornamentation of trucks into other forms and media.

=== Cars ===
Though cars are not traditionally decorated in South Asia, there are examples of cars embellished in a truck art style. In 2009, The Foxy Shahzadi, a 1974 VW Beetle decordated in a truck art style, traveled from Pakistan to France over a 25-day journey.&lt;ref name=dawn&gt;{{cite news|title=Foxy Shahzadi running away for good |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/880216/foxy-shahzadi-running-away-for-good|accessdate=13 June 2014|newspaper=The Dawn|date=24 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Walsh|first=Declan|title=From Pakistan to Paris, by VW Beetle |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/09/pakistan-paris-vw-beetle|accessdate=13 June 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=9 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Indian city of [[Mumbai]], some drivers decorate their taxis in a truck art style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/indian-truck-art-and-taxi-fabric-project-322688|title=Indian Truck Art and Taxi Design-artnet News|last=Kinsella|first=Eileen|date=5 August 2015|publisher=[[Artnet]]|language=English|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fashion===
The lively colors of Pakistani trucks have inspired multiple fashion designers.&lt;ref name=bbc.fashion&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan's truck art inspires catwalk fashion range |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-19292392|accessdate=13 June 2015|newspaper=BBC|date=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian fashion company [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]] used truck art-inspired displays in a 2015 campaign.&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheikh|first=Ibriz|title=Pakistani truck art takes over streets of Milan |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/894788/pakistani-truck-art-takes-over-streets-of-milan/|accessdate=13 September 2015|newspaper=The Express Tribune|date=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although used more often on women's fashion, some men's clothing have been inspired by South Asian truck art.&lt;ref name=fashion&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pakistantruckart.com/2010/03/06/truck-art-and-fashion/|title=Truck art and fashion |publisher=pakistantruckart.com|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
