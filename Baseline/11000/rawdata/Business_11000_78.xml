'''AZCA''', an acronym for '''''Asociación Mixta de Compensación de la Manzana A de la Zona Comercial de la Avenida del Generalísimo''''' ("Mixed Association for Compensation of the A Block of the Commercial Area of the Avenue of the [[Francisco Franco|Generalisimo]]", now called the Avenue of [[Paseo de la Castellana]]), is a [[Central business district|financial district]] in downtown [[Madrid]], Spain.

==History==
It is located between the streets Raimundo Fernández Villaverde, Orense, General Perón and Paseo de la Castellana. Its original conception (and its name) dates back to the ''Plan General de Ordenación Urbana de Madrid'' ([[PGOU]]), approved in 1946. The purpose of this plan was to create a huge block of modern office buildings with metro and railway connections in the expansion area of northern Madrid, just in front of Real Madrid stadium (currently named the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium]]) and beside the new government complex of [[Nuevos Ministerios]]. A botanical garden, a library and an opera house were also included in the plans, but these were never built.

The construction began in the 1970s after many delays. Nowadays some of the tallest and most beautiful modern Madrid skyscrapers are placed here. The most important are:

* [[Torre Picasso]] (157&amp;nbsp;m)
* [[Torre Europa (Madrid)|Torre Europa]] (121&amp;nbsp;m)
* [[Castellana 81|Banco de Bilbao Tower]] (107&amp;nbsp;m)
* [[Torre Titania]] (104&amp;nbsp;m)
* [[Torre Mahou]] (100&amp;nbsp;m)

In February 2005, [[Windsor Tower]] (106&amp;nbsp;m) was destroyed by a fire, and it was later replaced by Torre Titania.

During the weekend nights, the underground levels attract a Latino audience to the discos but they also have a reputation for gang violence.&lt;ref name="El Mundo"&gt;''[http://www.elmundo.es/papel/2006/02/07/madrid/1926910_impresora.html Que la violencia no vuelva a Azca]'', ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'', 7 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a [[Cuatro Torres Business Area|new skycraper area]] was built farther north along [[Paseo de la Castellana]].

'''Carl Adolf Engström''' (17 February 1855 — 19 June 1924) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[engineer]], [[businessman]] and [[vuorineuvos]].

Engström got familiar already at early age with large [[machinery]] and [[engineering]] [[workshop]] environment due to his stepfather's work as engineer in the [[VR Group|Finnish State Railways]]. After completing his [[mechanical engineering]] studies in [[Helsinki University of Technology|Helsinki Polytechnic School]] in 1877, Engström went to gain experience abroad in [[Sweden]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[United States]].

Upon his return in 1884, Engström got vacance in the State Railways. He took successfully part in [[steam locomotive]] designing, which was followed by railway projects in Savonia and Karelia. He worked as director for stone company Ab Granit in 1889–1895, after which he returned to State Railways for another five years.

Engström was appointed manager of [[Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstad|Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works]] in 1900. During his time the company developed rapidly and the sales increased significantly, largely due to [[Russo-Japanese War]] and the [[First World War]]. On the other hand, the time was difficult due to increased [[Strike action|strikes]] and confrontation between the workers and employers. Engström left his position as company manager in 1918; this was affected by the death of his son in the previous [[Finnish Civil War]].

== Early life ==
Adolf Engström was born in [[Vörå]], Ostrobothnia.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.141-151"/&gt; His parents were [[land surveyor]] Leonhard Engström and Adolfina née Taxell, who was daughter of [[Messukylä]] [[vicar]] Jonas Gabriel Taxell. The couple had two daughters and sons Adolf and Otto. Leonhard Engström died when Adolf was four years old, and the widow got married to her late husband's older brother Carl Petter Engström, who was [[Mechanical Engineer]]. The family moved to [[Helsinki]] in 1862, and the Ostrobothnian boy had to adopt to a new environment. The stepfather worked for the [[VR Group|Finnish State Railways]], and that way Adolf got familiar with [[engineering]] [[workshops]] and large [[machinery]] during his childhood. C. P. Engström became Chief Engineer in the State Railways in 1870 and during 1877–1890 he was board member in railway administration.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt;

== Studies and early career ==
Engström graduated from Helsinki Swedish Normal Lyceum in 1874 and continued his studies in [[Helsinki University of Technology|Helsinki Polytechnic School]] and graduated Mechanical Engineer in 1877.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.141-151"/&gt; He wanted to gain abroad useful practical experience abroad, which he could later use for developing his home country.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt; Engström first worked for [[Motala Verkstad|Motala Engineering Works]] in [[Sweden]] as [[draftsman]], and then in [[German Empire|Germany]] for [[Hannoversche Maschinenbau AG]] and [[Hohenzollern Locomotive Works]]. He went next to [[England]], where he worked for [[Beyer Peacock &amp; Co]] in [[Manchester]]. Engström's following step was the [[United States]]; he worked for [[Pennsylvania Railroad Company]] [[Altoona Works]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.141-151"/&gt;

== State Railways ==
In 1884 Engström returned to Finland, for State Railways, to take part in a locomotive project. The target was to design a locomotive suitable for [[Oulu]] railway; it should be firewood compatible and also stronger and more [[Fuel efficiency|fuel efficient]], than a type used on [[Vaasa|Nikolaistad]] railway. Engström redesigned the [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]] and made the structure more robust. This locomotive type was produced total 104 units.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt;

After the Oulu railway was built, Engström continued in Savonian and Karelian railway projects. He worked for State Railways until 1889.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt;

Engström returned to State Railways for 1895–1900 to work as engineering workshop manager's assistant.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt;

== Ab Granit ==
As there were no new railway development projects, Engström sought for new opportunities. In 1889 he was appointed director and technical manager of Ab Granit, which was a stone company in [[Hanko]]. The company had gained foothold in construction business in Helsinki and grown amongst 30 largest companies of Finland. At the turn of the 1890s the company employed 268 people. The 1894 erected [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]] statue in [[Helsinki Senate Square|Senate Square]], of which foundation was constructed by Granit, promoted the company's sales in [[Russian Empire|Russia]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt;

== Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works ==
Engström was appointed manager of [[Hietalahti shipyard|Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstads Ab]] ("Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works") in 1900. He followed engineer [[Edvin Bergroth]], who was the first manager of the company that was re-established after [[bankruptcy]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt; Bergroth had developed the operations through investments, and Engström received leadership of a financially solid company, which he continued developing determinedly.&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.58-77"&gt;Osakeyhtiö Hietalahden...: ''Toiminta uuden vuosisadan aikana. Vuodet 1901–1914.'' pp. 58–77.&lt;/ref&gt; Engström sometimes faced situations which needed quick decisions – he for example received repair work of a [[shipwreck]]ed vessel which was too large to the [[Dry dock|dock]]; the dock was extended during the salvage process.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt;

The [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1904–1905 led to increased order intake of [[torpedo boat]]s for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]]. During 1900–1914 the company built total about 60 steam and motor vessels. In addition to shipbuilding, the company produced large number of ship engines, [[Boiler (power generation)|steam boilers]] and also [[railway wagon]]s.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt; Engström's personal contribution was significant in the rolling stock production, and the wagon projects balanced the wintertime docking workload drop.&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.58-77"/&gt;

Engström developed and modernised the [[shipyard]]; this meant new methods, as electrical [[welding]] and [[pneumatic tool]]s. The dock was further extended in 1910 and 1912 and a new [[brass foundry]] was taken into use in 1914. Two years later a new main engineering workshop was opened. Prior to the [[First World War]], the company employed 597 people and the annual sales reached 2.4 million [[Finnish markka|marks]]. The First World War increased the business again; during 1915–1917 the company docked total 400 vessels. Engström had also further plans which did not actualise, such as a new dock layout, that would have enabled building many large ships simultaneously. All the investments were funded by company profit, and the company did not collect capital from outside during that. By 1919, when Engström left his position, the share capital had grown from half million to six million marks.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt;

Engström's era as shipyard leader was the time of organisation of labour and employers. The yard experienced some occasional [[Strike action|strikes]] at the late 19th century, and after the yard faced larger strikes and conflicts in 1902, Engström called other engineering industry employers to negotiate about forming an [[employers' association]]. The first general [[collective agreement]] between the [[Trade union|union]] and employers was signed in 1906. Already in 1908 the employers planned to end the agreements because they had not put an end to striking. At the beginning Engström supported collective agreements, but changed his mind in 1909. This led to a long-term strike, which eventually ended to defeat for the union – the engineering industry workers returned to work without having a collective agreement. Consequently, the relations between employers' association and trade unions suffered badly.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt;

== Organisational activities ==
Engström was founding member of the 1903 created Finnish Engineering Industry Employers' Association and deputy chairman until 1911, after which he served as chairman until 1919. He also took part in founding the Swedish Technical Science Academy of Finland &lt;!-- Svenska tekniska vetenskapsakademien i Finland --&gt; and he became honorary member of the Finnish Technical Association in 1920.&lt;!-- Suomen Teknillinen Yhdistys --&gt; During 1903−1911 he was member of Helsinki City Council.&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.141-151"/&gt;

== Committee memberships ==
*Railway Economy Investigation Committee, &lt;!-- Rautateiden talouden tutkimuskomitea --&gt; 1885–1895 and 1906
*Railway Committee, 1892–1893
*Committee for Railway Rolling Stock Construction Promotion, &lt;!-- Komitea rautateiden liikkuvan kaluston rakentamisen edistämiseksi --&gt; 1896
*Representative of Finland in International Railway Conference, 1895
*Vocational Education Committee, 1908
*Advisor member of Railway Administration, 1908–1916
*Domestic Shipbuilding Promotion Committee, &lt;!-- Kotimaisen laivanrakennuksen edistämiskomitea --&gt; 1912 and 1919
*Railway Administration Inspector General, 1919–1922&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Engström got married to Eva Alexandra Karolina née Jansson in 1885. Their only son died in the [[Finnish Civil War]] in 1918. This made Engström to leave his position as company manager. The couple donated a large sum to be shared as [[scholarship]]s to young technicians, who were orientated to [[shipbuilding]] and engineering industry.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Engström (1855-1924)"/&gt;

He was born in Oslo as a grandson of [[Alf Bjercke]].&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Alf Richard Bjercke|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://snl.no/Alf_Richard_Bjercke|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alf Bjercke (1851–1933) was a notable businessman, especially within paint and [[lacquer]], and politician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alf Bjercke|url=http://snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Alf_Bjercke/utdypning|website=snl.no|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are descendants of politician [[Lars Thorstensen Tønsager]].&lt;ref name=rb&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rb.no/lokal_kultur/article1765855.ece|title=Bondehæren som unngikk storkrig|last=Karlsson|first=Terje|date=2 October 2005|work=Romerikes Blad|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was initiated in 1989 at his chapter's centennial celebration.&lt;ref name="phigam"/&gt;

==Business career==
In 1950 he became co-owner of the family company, named [[Alf Bjercke (company)|Alf Bjercke]]. He served as CEO from 1966 to 1971. When Alf Bjercke (the company) was incorporated into [[Jotun (company)|Jotun]] in 1972, Bjercke served as chairman of the board until 1983 and then chaired the corporate council until 1988.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; He has also chaired the [[employers' association]] for paint and coating companies.&lt;ref name=ntb/&gt; He has also started other companies and brands, including Fjordplast&lt;ref name=ntb/&gt; and the first Norwegian bottled water brand Norwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nrk.no/programmer/tv/brennpunkt/1.5392467|title=Historien om Norwater|last=Andersen|first=Espen|author2=Norstrøm, Jørn|author3= Tønset|author4= Snorre|date=15 April 2008|publisher=Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1963 to 1993 he was the [[Consul (representative)|consul-general]] for [[Tunisia]] in Norway.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;

==Research==
At the age of 69, Bjercke took up private research on Norwegian [[dragoon]]s in [[Schleswig-Holstein]] from 1758 to 1762. These dragoons were border guards, but never saw military action.&lt;ref name=dr1999&gt;{{cite news|title=Malingfabrikanten og hans dragoner|last=Haugestad|first=Erik|date=29 July 1999|work=Aftenposten|page=8|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; His interest in the topic spawned when he discovered that a distant ancestor from the [[Eidsvoll]] area had been such a dragoon.&lt;ref name=rb/&gt; In 1999 the [[University of Kiel]] published a work by Bjercke, ''Norwegische Kätnersöhne als königliche Dragoner''. He would try to submit this work to the [[University of Oslo]] as a thesis, possibly earning the [[dr.philos.]] degree. An obstacle was his lack of a formal degree of [[higher education]].&lt;ref name=dr1999/&gt; The candidacy for the doctorate met opposition in the university, and the case was delayed for several years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Skjebnedag for Bjercke|last=Sandberg|first=Tor|date=25 February 2003|work=Dagsavisen|page=5|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the university finally rejected to take it up for doctoral assessment.&lt;ref name=rb/&gt;

Bjercke has also released an autobiography: ''Back-up av et rikt liv'' (2001),&lt;ref&gt;[http://ask.bibsys.no/ask/action/show?pid=012016705&amp;kid=biblio Entry] in [[BIBSYS]]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as many other books.

==Organizations==
Bjercke was among the founders of the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Anders Lange Party]], later known as the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]]. He later resigned his membership because he disagreed on a number of issues.&lt;ref name=siv&gt;{{cite news|title=Norske forbilder|last=Hansen|first=Lars Ditlev|date=1 August 2008|work=A-magasinet|page=6|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1974 to 1976 he was a board member of the [[Oslo]] [[Conservative Party of Norway|Conservative Party]].&lt;ref name=ntb/&gt; He also served one term in Oslo city council.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Some time around [[Siv Jensen]]'s takeover as party leader he rejoined the Progress Party.

Bjercke was also a founder of the [[Norwegian Organization for Asylum Seekers]], and has been a board member. He has also held board/council memberships in the [[Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation]], the [[World Wildlife Fund|World Wildlife Fund, Norway]] and the [[Norway-America Association]], and has been involved in [[Rotary International]].&lt;ref name=ntb/&gt; He has been an initiator for restoration of the world's oldest steamship ''[[Skibladner]]'' for traffic,&lt;ref name=aft80/&gt; and has vice-chaired the board that is responsible for the ship ''[[Christian Radich]]''.&lt;ref name=ntb/&gt; Representing the sports club [[IF Ready]], he was deputy chairman of the [[Norwegian Athletics Association]] in 1968, before being elected to chairman at the 1968 congress, serving from 1969 to 1972. He was a member of the [[Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports|Norwegian Olympic Committee]] during the leadership period.&lt;ref name=ntb/&gt; He led the athletic team at the 1972 Olympics in Munich.

Bjercke has been decorated with the [[Order of St. Olav]],&lt;ref name=ntb/&gt; and has also been decorated by the Tunisian state as a Commander, by the Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]] with an Off. of the Star of Ethiopia and by [[Rotary International]] with the Paul Harris Medal with 5 sapphires.

'''Amode Ibrahim Atchia''' (1868 – 17 September 1947), otherwise known as '''Major Atchia''', was an [[entrepreneur]] and technologist in the [[Indian Ocean Islands]] who pioneered the use of scientific concepts and invented structural and mechanical advances in technology for the nationbuilding of [[Mauritius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dukhira|first=Chit|title=The genuis &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93;: Amode Ibrahim Atchia, (1868-1947)|url=http://www.lexpress.mu/article/genuis-amode-ibrahim-atchia-1868-1947|publisher=lexpess.mu.online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Rose-Belle]], in [[Grand Port district]], AIA was the son of a [[Surti Muslims]] merchant called Ibrahim Sulleman Atchia who had arrived from [[Barbodhan]], a village 15&amp;nbsp;km from [[Surat]], in [[Gujarat]] state of [[India]] in the course of free trade. Despite little formal education, Amode Ibrahim Atchia, along with his three brothers, set about making unprecedented contributions to laying down the foundations of Mauritian society during the early [[1900s (decade)|1900s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Emrith|first=Moomtaz|title=The Muslims in Mauritius|year=1967|publisher=Emrith|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0uUPAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=amode+ibrahim+atchia&amp;dq=amode+ibrahim+atchia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j4lBUtagF8fZtQam1YDwAg&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enterprise==
AIA is credited with setting up the ''Société Atchia Frères'', reconstructing the first [[mosque]] at [[Beau-Bassin Rose-Hill|Rose Hill]] following the historic cyclone of 1892, and constructing the first ice factory and saw mill since the 1920s, with technological innovations in use of wind-energy and pre-fabricated concrete. The Atchias also opened the first Indian-run primary school near the mosque.

'''Armenian Street,''' locally known as '''Aranmanaikaran Street''', is one of the historical streets of the commercial centre of [[George Town, Chennai|George Town]] in [[Chennai]], [[India]]. The road runs north–south and connects Mannady Street in the north with the [[China Bazaar Road, Chennai|China Bazaar Road (NSC Bose Road)]] in the south. The street is dotted with several century-old historical structures.

The street is named for the [[Armenians]], who were some of the early settlers in the city of Madras. Several moved to the long street of the commercial neighbourhood of George Town in the 1750s, eventually making the street bear their name. The locals, however, corrupted the name to Aranmanaikaran Street, which means the 'street of the palace people'.&lt;ref name="IndiaToday_SomePastRecollections"/&gt;

==History==
The earliest existence of Armenians in India dates back to the late 8th century with the arrival of Thomas Cana along the [[Malabar Coast]] in AD 780. Although not much is known about his origin or mission, ''Portraits of Hope: Armenians in the Contemporary World'' by Huberta Von Voss indicates that he was lauded for his work for the rebirth of Christianity. However, it was not until the 1660s that the Armenian presence in Madras became eminent. According to ''Madras: The Land, The People and Their Governance'' by S. Muthiah, the earliest Armenian tombstone in the city is of Coja David Margar found near Little Mount, which dates back to 1663. The Armenians of Madras were believed to be the first to discover the sepulchre of [[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas]] upon the [[St. Thomas Mount|Mount]] and took the Portuguese there in the 16th century. Legend has it that the church atop the mount served as a lighthouse to guide Portuguese and Armenian ships around that time. Although the time when Armenians began settling down in the city remains obscure, records clearly suggest that the Armenians monopolised trade between India and West Asia on the one hand and Manila, a Spanish bastion then, on the other. Their main trades included silk, spices and gems. The last Armenian to live in the city was Michael Stephen, who too left the city.&lt;ref name="Hindu_MerchantsOnAMission"&gt;{{cite news

==Historical buildings along the street==
[[File:The Armenian Church of St. Mary, 1905.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.90|left|The Armenian Church of St. Mary, c. 1905]]
[[File:St.Mary's Anglo-Indian Higher Secondary School.jpg|thumb|upright=0.90|St. Mary's Anglo-Indian Higher Secondary School]]

The long and narrow street houses several historically important buildings, including several places of worship. The [[Armenian Church, Chennai|Armenian Church]] is perhaps the most visible Armenian monument in the city. It was first built in 1712 and later rebuilt after the French siege in 1772. The first church was built of timber in the present [[Madras High Court|High Court]] area after obtaining permission from the [[East India Company]]. The East India Company gave the Armenians 50 pounds towards managing the expenses of the church, which encouraged more traders to settle in and around the church. In ''Vestiges of Old Madras'', H. D. Love points out that the earliest Armenian church, situated in Old Black Town, as shown in Thomas Pitt's map, was probably built shortly after the Company entered into a covenant with the Armenian residents in India. The new church, however, was consecrated in Aga Shawmier's chapel grounds in George Town. It is the church that gave the street its name.&lt;ref name="Hindu_MerchantsOnAMission"/&gt; The church has the biggest bells in the city, each weighing 200&amp;nbsp;kg and the oldest two dating back to 1754 and 1778, and its altar belongs to an earlier Armenian church that was near the [[Madras High Court]].&lt;ref name="IndiaToday_SomePastRecollections"/&gt; Two other bells were gifted by Eliazar Shawmier and the remaining two are from 1837. The church complex also served as a cemetery for the Armenian population in the city. Reverend Haroutiun Shmavonian, the founder, publisher and editor of the world's first Armenian periodical 'Azdarar', is buried here. Today, the Armenian church complex is managed by an Armenian trust based in [[Kolkata]].

The [[St Mary's Co-Cathedral]] abutting the church dates from 1658, which became the Cathedral of Madras in 1886. The cathedral has several old oil paintings. The church's Parish Hall hosted several Tamil music concerts of the [[Tamil Isai Sangam]] in the 1940s, when orthodox groups opposed the move to propagate Tamil songs in [[Carnatic music]], which had several musical icons of the day such as [[M. S. Subbulakshmi]], [[K. B. Sundarambal]] and [[M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar]] singing in it.&lt;ref name="IndiaToday_SomePastRecollections"/&gt; The Tamil Isai Sangam functioned from Gokhale Hall from 1944 to 1953. [[St. Mary's Anglo-Indian Higher Secondary School]], one of the oldest schools in India and one of the first five schools to be set up during the British period, is located adjacent to St Mary's Co-Cathedral and is established in 1839.

The most visible Armenian monument in Chennai is the much-written about Armenian church, which was first built in 1712 and later rebuilt after the French siege in 1772. The first church was built of timber in the present High Court area with permission from the East India Company. The Armenians were given 50 pounds to manage the expenses of the church. This encouraged more traders to settle in and around the area. Vestiges of Old Madras by H.D. Love points out that the earliest Armenian church, situated in Old Black Town, as shown in Thomas Pitt’s map, was probably built shortly after the Company entered into a covenant with the Armenian residents in India. The new church, however, was consecrated in Aga Shawmier’s chapel grounds in George Town. The street on which the church is situated continues to be called the Armenian Street, where the settlers once lived.&lt;ref name="Hindu_MerchantsOnAMission"/&gt;

The street is also the headquarters of [[Binny and Co.|Binny's]], a leading business establishment of the city from 1799 till its closure in the 1990s, which moved the office to the area in 1812. The headquarters building is a classic structure with curved verandahs, huge halls and teak wood stairs. However, the fate of the building remains obscure since the closure of the organisation.&lt;ref name="IndiaToday_SomePastRecollections"/&gt;

The headquarters building of the Young Men's Indian Association (YMIA), built by [[Annie Besant]] in 1915, is located next to Binny's. The building also housed an oratory called the [[Gokhale Hall]], which, in time, became a venue for public meetings and performances by public artists. The age-old building is now expected to be demolished.&lt;ref name="IndiaToday_SomePastRecollections"&gt;{{cite news

The street is also home to the old Hindu temple of [[Kachchaleswarar Temple|Kachchaleswarar Koil]].

'''B Corporation''' certification (also known as '''B Lab''' certification or '''B Corp''' certification) is a private certification issued to [[For-profit corporation|for-profit companies]] by [[B Lab]], a global [[501(c) organization|nonprofit]] organization with offices in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and a partnership in Latin America with Sistema B. To be granted and to preserve certification, companies must receive a minimum score on an online assessment for "[[Social impact assessment|social and environmental performance]]", satisfy the requirement that the company integrate [[B Lab]] commitments to [[Stakeholder theory|stakeholders]] into [[By-law|company governing documents]],  and pay an annual fee ranging from $500 to $50,000.&lt;ref name="Make It Official"&gt;{{cite web |title=B Corporation: Welcome  |publisher=[[B Lab]] |url=http://www.bcorporation.net/become-a-b-corp/how-to-become-a-b-corp/make-it-official |accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2018, there are over 2,600 certified B Corporations across 150 industries in 60 countries.&lt;ref name="B Corporation: Welcome"&gt;{{cite web |title=B Corporation: Welcome  |publisher=[[B Lab]] |url=http://www.bcorporation.net/ |accessdate=August, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
[[File:Runa B Corp Label.jpg|thumb|Example of a B Corp certification label|193x193px]]
The B Lab certification is a third party standard requiring companies to meet [[social sustainability]] and environmental performance standards, meet accountability standards, and to be [[Sustainability reporting|transparent]] to the public according to the score they receive on the assessment. B Lab certification applies to the whole company across all product lines and issue areas. For-profits of all legal [[business entities|business structures]] are eligible for certification.

===Advantages===
* Similar to other [[Companies law|business associations]], certified B Corporations and their employees have access to a number of discounts from outside entities and fellow members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Save Money and Access Services |publisher=[[B Lab]] |url=http://www.bcorporation.net/become-a-b-corp/why-become-a-b-corp/save-money-and-access-services |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Academic contributions of loan forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Loan Assistance Program — Overview  |publisher=Columbia Business School |url=http://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/socialenterprise/careers/loanassistance |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Loan Assistance Program – Detailed Summary |publisher=New York University Stern School of Business |url=http://web-docs.stern.nyu.edu/admissions/financial-aid-loan-assistance-program-description-and-policies.pdf |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Loan Forgiveness Program |publisher=[[Yale School of Management]] |url=http://som.yale.edu/our-programs/full-time-mba/admissions/financing-your-mba/loan-forgiveness-program |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
* B Lab certification has no legal status.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Distinction from benefit corporation===
{{further|Benefit corporation}}
* Benefit corporation is a legal status conferred by state law in the US; B Lab certification is issued by a private organisation and has no legislative framework.&lt;ref name="What Are B Corps"&gt;{{cite web|title=What Are B Corps |publisher=[[B Lab]] |url=https://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps/legislation |accessdate=16 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517152828/https://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps/legislation |archivedate=17 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* B Lab certification is not needed to obtain benefit corporation status.&lt;ref name="What Are B Corps"/&gt;
* Legislation for the passage of this corporate legal status has been passed in 30 states, including [[Delaware corporation|Delaware]], whereas B Lab certification is privately issued by an organisation run by people principally issued from the business community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schwartz |first=Ariel |title=Delaware Just Made It A Whole Lot Easier For Socially Responsible Companies To Exist |publisher=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company &amp; Inc.]] |date=July 23, 2013 |url=http://www.fastcoexist.com/1682654/delaware-just-made-it-a-whole-lot-easier-for-socially-responsible-companies-to-exist |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification process==

===Online assessment===
To obtain a B Corporation certification, a company first completes an online assessment. Companies that earn a minimum score of 80 out of 200 points undergo an assessment review process, essentially a conference call verifying the claims made in their assessment. Companies are required to provide supporting documentation before they are certified.

The assessment covers the company’s entire operation and measures the positive impact of the company in areas of [[Corporate governance|governance]], [[Employee engagement|workers]], [[Community service#Personal benefits of serving|community]], the [[Environmental impact|environment]], as well as the product or service the company provides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Network for Business Innovation and Sustainability |title=B Corporations, Benefit Corporations and Social Purpose Corporations: Launching a New Era of Impact-Driven Companies |publisher=NBIS |date=October 2012 |url=http://nbis.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ImpactDrivenCompanies_NBIS_Whitepaper_Oct2012.pdf |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social business|Socially]] and environmentally-focused business model points ultimately are accrued in their relevant impact area (governance, workers, community or environment).&lt;ref name=giirs&gt;{{cite web |title=GIIRS Governance |publisher=[[B Lab]] |url=http://giirs.org/about-giirs/how-giirs-works/185 |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on a company's industry, geographic location, and number of employees, the online assessment adjusts the weightings of the question categories to increase its relevancy. For instance, companies with more employees will have a heavier weighting in the workers category, and companies in [[Manufacturing sector|manufacturing]] will have a heavier weighting in the environment category.

To maintain credibility, the B Corporation certification standard operates under principles that are independent, comprehensive, comparable, dynamic, and transparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AB 361 Assembly Bill - BILL ANALYSIS |publisher=[[California State Assembly]] |url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/asm/ab_0351-0400/ab_361_cfa_20110624_120507_sen_comm.html |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; B Lab has an established standards advisory council that can independently make decisions with or without the support of B Lab.&lt;ref name=giirs /&gt;  As of May 2014, 28 of 30 members were listed by their business affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Standards Advisory Council |publisher=[[B Lab]] |url=http://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps/the-non-profit-behind-b-corps/standards-advisory-council |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council recommends improvements to the B Corp assessment on a biennial basis. There is a 30-day public consultation period before releasing a new version of the B Corporation assessment.&lt;ref name="giirs"/&gt;

Currently the B Corp assessment is its fifth version, with the sixth version scheduled to be released in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Corporate Social Responsibility Comes In Many Flavors, Some Not So Tasty |publisher=NonProfit Times Publishing Group |url=http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/news-articles/corporate-social-responsibility-comes-in-many-flavors-some-not-so-tasty/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal requirements===
Certification also requires companies to integrate their stakeholder commitments into the company governing documents. In the United States, the avenue for corporations making the legal amendment to certify will depend on the state they are [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in. Some states known as "constituency" states will allow for this change in the articles of incorporation, other states, known as "non-constituency states", will not; and many states now have the option of adopting the [[benefit corporation]] legal structure, which also meets B Lab's requirements for B Corp certification.&lt;ref name=howto&gt;{{cite web |title=Corporation Legal Roadmap |publisher=[[B Lab]] |url=https://www.bcorporation.net/become-a-b-corp/how-to-become-a-b-corp/legal-roadmap/corporation-legal-roadmap |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the corporate model, other for-profit business entities make an amendment of the company by-laws or governing documents. These include:
* The establishment of clear wording to "consider stakeholder interests" in company [[Articles of Incorporation|articles of incorporation]] or [[By-law|company by-laws]].&lt;ref name=howto /&gt;
* Define "[[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]" as the employees, the community, the environment, suppliers, customers, and shareholders.&lt;ref name=howto /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Boatright (2006) and Johnstone and Lionais (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; 
* No prioritization of one stakeholder over another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= OLR Backgrounder: Social Enterprise and the Benefit Corporation |publisher=State of Connecticut, Office of Legislative Research |url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/2013/rpt/2013-R-0260.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Allowing for the company's values to exist under new management, investors, or ownership.&lt;ref name=howto /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Lencioni (July 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, B Lab certification allows the company bylaws to remain secret.

==International adoption==
In September 2018, there were over 2,000 certified B Corporations across 130 industries in 50 countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahsweeney/2018/09/13/how-b-corporations-change-the-way-entrepreneurs-think-about-profit-and-consumers/#405f3d5c3470|title=How B Corporations Change The Way Entrepreneurs Think About Profit And Consumers|last=Sweeney|first=Deborah|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Canada]] (78 companies), [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], and [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="B Corporation: Welcome"/&gt; The most active community outside of the United States is '''Sistema B'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The double bottom line: Profit and social benefit  |journal=Business Horizons |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681313001729 | doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2013.10.001 |volume=57 |pages=11–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2012, Sistema B has been the adaptation of the B Corps movement in [[Latin America]], including in [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Colombia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Camacho |first=Manuel Antonio |title=In Just a Few Months, Sistema B (AKA: B Corp) Finds Fertile Ground for Social Enterprises in Latin America |url=http://www.nextbillion.net/blogpost.aspx?blogid=2908 |date=August 15, 2012 |publisher=NextBillion.net |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This non-profit adapts proprietary certifications and evaluation metrics and modifies both to the context of each country.

==Organisation==

Benelux-China
The Benelux Chamber of Commerce - BenCham - is the most active business platform in China.  Its members, leading companies from Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, share an active interest in developing trade and business in China. It is the only Chamber of Commerce that is officially recognised and supported by the Embassy of the Kingdom of Belgium, the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Embassy of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg in China.

BenCham has been growing at a steady pace since it was established in 2001.  It currently contains 3 chapters; one in Beijing, one in Shanghai and one in Guangzhou (Pearl River Delta).  It is the prime platform for the Benelux business community to get together.

BenCham currently has over 320 members, aspiring to grow further every day.  Its base consists of Large Enterprises, Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) as well as individuals with an active interest in developing their business in China. As an independent, non-profit organisation, BenCham is managed by a full-time secretariat of both Benelux and Chinese staff.  All practises are guided by an active Board of Directors.  BenCham sustains itself through membership subscriptions, sponsorships and event fees.

On May 27, 2010, BenCham received the Accreditation Certificate from the BLCCA (Accreditation Programme for Belgian and Belgian-Luxembourg Chambers of Commerce Abroad)

==History==
The Benelux Chamber of Commerce originated in [[Shanghai]] in 2001.  The Benelux Business Association (BBA), as they were called then, was established through the merger of the Dutch Business Association and the Belgian-Luxembourg Business Association.  In 2005, the [[Beijing]] chapter was created. In March 2006 the BBA changed its name to the Benelux Chamber of Commerce in China (BenCham).
Recently, BenCham expanded its presence in China by founding a third chapter in [[Guangzhou]], representing the flourishing business in the Pearl River Delta (PRD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China IPR Helpdesk - BenCham|url=http://www.china-iprhelpdesk.eu/en/helpdesk-partners|publisher=China IPR helpdesk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331002938/http://www.china-iprhelpdesk.eu/en/helpdesk-partners|archivedate=2012-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3468">[[File:Hagemann.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Carl Hagemann]]
'''Carl Hagemann''' (April 9, 1867 in [[Essen]] &amp;ndash; November 20, 1940 in [[Frankfurt am Main]]) was a German chemist, industrial manager and one of the most important German art collectors and patrons in the first half of the 20th Century.

==Life==
[[File:Kirchner Berlin Street Scene 1913.jpg|thumb|''Berlin Street Scene'' (1913) by [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]]]] Hagemann grew up in a middle-class family in Essen, where he attended the humanist Gymnasium am Burgplatz. He studied philosophy and chemistry from 1886 to 1890 in [[Tübingen]], [[Hanover]] and [[Leipzig]], and obtained a Ph.D. from the [[University of Leipzig]] in [[Johannes Wislicenus]]'s team.  [[Hagemann's ester]], or ethyl-2-methyl-4-oxo-2-cyclohexenecarboxylate, is an organic compound that was first prepared and described by Hagemann in 1893. In 1894, he joined the [[Bayer AG|Bayer]] color factories and made a career there. In 1920 he became technical director of the [[Cassella Farbwerke Mainkur Aktiengesellschaft]] in Frankfurt. Following their incorporation into the newly formed [[IG Farben]] in 1925, he became a member of the board. By the age of 65, he retired in 1932. He also wrote a book called ''Spiele der Voelker'' (Schuster und Loeffler, 1921); in this book he shows examples of dance and play in Japan, Africa, India and China.

Around the turn of the century Hagemann started to collect art. His first collection objects were from popular graphics artists. In the second decade of the 20th Century, first under the influence of his friend [[Ernst Gosebruch]], the director of the Essen Museum of Art, Hagemann turned toward painters of ''[[Die Brücke]]'' and [[Emil Nolde]]. He was a friend of [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] until his death in 1938.

In the course of four decades Hagemann put together a very personal collection of paintings, prints and sculptures. A significant highlight of the  pictures was Kirchner's "Berlin Street Scene" ([[Neue Galerie New York]]). 

After his accidental death in 1940, he left a collection of about 1,900 art objects, including nearly a hundred paintings by [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]], [[Erich Heckel]], [[Otto Mueller]], [[Emil Nolde]] and others.

Since it was considered [[degenerate art]] during the time of the Nazi regime, [[Ernst Holzinger]], then director of the [[Städel Museum]] in Frankfurt, took a high personal risk, as he hid the entire collection in the Städel. In this way, the collection survived the war largely unscathed.

Today, pictures from Hagemann's collection are found in museums around the world and some of them are privately owned. The graphics and drawings were received as a gift by the [[Städel]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1645">In the [[United Kingdom]], the '''Comprehensive Performance Assessment''' ('''CPA'''), conducted by the '''[[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|Audit Commission]]''', assessed the performance of every [[local authority]] and the services that they provide for local people.

The Audit Commission first introduced CPA in 2002. It evolved in response to changes in the operational and regulatory environment, rising public expectations, and the performance of local government itself.

CPA measured how well councils delivered services for local people and communities. It looked at performance from a range of perspectives and combined a set of judgements to provide both a simply understood rating and a more complete picture of where to focus activity to secure improvement.

CPA was replaced by the [[Comprehensive Area Assessment]] in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/cpa/cpatransition.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: CPA should not be confused with the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports, or CAFR a practice started after World War II in the United States (replacing "off the books" practices such as "general fixed asset account group"); A CAFR is one of several standard Government financial reports.

'''David T. Beers''' is a financial analyst and until December 2011 was head of sovereign credit ratings for [[credit rating agency]] [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] (S&amp;P).&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;Hasan, Mehdi (August 5, 2011).[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/aug/05/us-credit-rating-downgraded-moodys "The US should let its credit rating be downgraded – and shrug"]. ''Guardian''. Retrieved August 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, Beers earned significant attention as the S&amp;P executive responsible for downgrading the [[credit rating]] of [[United States Treasury security|United States Treasury bonds]] to [[Bond credit rating|AA+]]. Prior to this, the United States had maintained a AAA credit rating since 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Paletta, Damian (July 22, 2011).

==Education and career==
Beers received a B.A. degree in international relations from the [[University of Virginia]] and an M.Sc. degree in economics from the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE). He has since set up a scholarship at LSE in his name.&lt;ref name=Younglai&gt;Younglai, Rachelle; da Costa, Ana (August 2, 2011). [https://news.yahoo.com/insight-ratings-agencies-judge-world-172752099.html "When ratings agencies judge the world"]. ''Reuters'' (Yahoo!). Retrieved August 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Beers joined S&amp;P in 1990 focused on rating sovereign debt of over 100 countries. Prior to that, Beers had been an economist at [[Salomon Brothers]] focused on analyzing the creditworthiness of [[sovereign debt]]. He also worked at Bankers Trust Company, evaluating the risks of lending to Asia-Pacific countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zask, Ezra |title=Global investment risk management: protecting international portfolios against currency, interest rate, equity, and commodity risk |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zJTjl3JhNr8C |accessdate=August 16, 2011 |year=2000 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |isbn=978-0-07-135315-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media perception==
Starting in the early 1970s, the "Big Three" ratings agencies (S&amp;P, Moody's, and Fitch) began to receive payment for their work by the securities issuers for whom they issue those ratings, which has led to charges that these ratings agencies can no longer always be impartial when issuing ratings for those securities issuers.&lt;ref name=Younglai/&gt;  Securities issuers have been accused of "shopping" for the best ratings from these three ratings agencies, in order to attract investors, until at least one of the agencies delivers favorable ratings. This arrangement has been cited as one of the primary causes of the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] which began in 2007.&lt;ref name=Younglai/&gt;

Although relatively unknown to the general public, Beers is one of the most influential people in the world: the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' newspaper wrote in August 2011 that, "In recent weeks, we have witnessed elected leaders in the world's most powerful nation dancing to the tune of David Beers. He's the mustachioed, chain-smoking head of sovereign credit ratings for S&amp;P, the largest and arguably most influential member of the big three." [[Reuters]], meanwhile, said: "You may have never heard of David Beers but every finance minister in the world knows of him".&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'' has said of Beers that he "might be the most powerful man in the world that you've never heard of."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

'''David Zeiger''' (February 21, 1918 - May 10, 1981) Brazilian industrialist in the area of clothing and fashion.

Zeiger's family immigrated from [[Ukraine]] (the part of Ukraine that was then part of [[Poland]]) to [[Brazil]] in the early 1920s. David, with his siblings and mother, met with his father Shaja Zeiger, who had left Poland a year earlier. Shaja Zeiger was a tailor, and in a few years founded Goomtex, a factory for raincoats and overcoats. As a young man, David Zeiger worked with his father, and soon became the manager of the business. After his marriage, David Zeiger began to run Pullsport—a women's fashion factory—along with his wife [[Mila Zeiger|Mila]].

David Zeiger also dedicated his energy to the areas of culture, philanthropy, and publicity.

==Early Years and Education==
[[Image:David Zeiger Diploma do clube portugues 1964.jpg|thumb|left]]
Zeiger was born in [[Kovel]], Poland, which is now part of [[Ukraine]]. Although raised and educated within the community of Jewish immigrants in the [[São Paulo]] neighborhood of [[Bom Retiro (District of São Paulo)|Bom Retiro]], the adolescent Zeiger already had a good command of Portuguese and a curiosity for Brazilian culture that led him to seek friendships outside the small European community where he lived.

He became a member of the Espéria club, and of the Tietê [[regatta]] club in which he participated as a rower in competitions. He joined the Portugália club, which published a newspaper with texts written by various members. His news stories and fiction began to be published under the guidance of the poet Mario Gallo. Zeiger finished his education at the São Paulo Technical School of Accounting.

==Community Activities==

[[Image:David Zeiger Carta de Scylla Medici 1972-01-27.jpg|thumb|right|180px]]
After [[World War II]], Zeiger began his philanthropic activities. He helped raise funds and contributed his own resources to the newly created state of [[Israel]].

Most of his efforts were for social causes focused on Brazil. He assisted Carmem Prudente in the establishment of the [[Institute of Cancer of São Paulo|Hospital do Câncer]], and in the charitable campaigns that followed. 

[[Image:Diploma de Benemérito - Hospital Albert Einstein.jpg|miniaturadaimagem|180x180px|right]]
He was an initial donor of the [[Albert Einstein Hospital|Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein]]. He gave medical access to his employees through the  network of SERMA clinics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sermasaude.org/rede-credenciada-da-serma.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citizenship and Politics==
[[Image:David Zeiger com Deputado Cunha Bueno.jpg|thumb|right|260px]]
[[Image:David Zeiger com Pele.jpg|thumb|left|120px]]
Zeiger believed in a Brazil based on the market economy of the United States—with a vast middle class, general access to education and medical services. During the [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] administration (1956 to 1961), he found a favorable climate for this view, which would help Brazil to move out of its agrarian economy to become an industrial giant. At that time Zeiger met congressman Antônio Sílvio Cunha Bueno, with whom he developed a long friendship, and through which he began to participate more actively in the political life of the country. Zeiger promoted Cunha Bueno within the Jewish community. The friendship with the Cunha Bueno family resulted in two homages: David Zeiger Public School, and David Zeiger Street, both in São Paulo.

==Career==
[[Image:Marca Pull Sport.jpg|thumb|left|150px]]
During the years of the "Economic Miracle" in the 1960s and 1970s, David Zeiger's business expanded quickly. His factory (Cia Pullsport of Malharia) grew to occupy two buildings of seven floors with 500 employees.

In 1967, [[Time Magazine]]&lt;ref&gt;TIME Magazine, ''Brazil's President Costa e Silva'', 1967/04/21&lt;/ref&gt; published a cover story with the photo of [[Artur da Costa e Silva|President Costa e Silva]]. The subject was the surge of progress in the economy of Brazil. It quoted examples of leaders in various fields of activity, and presented Zeiger as an example of an industrialist. Zeiger had an unpretentious and communicative character, which he demonstrated equally with both his company employees and important personalities.

==Other interests==

[[Image:David Zeiger Homenagem da Fundação Bienal de São Paulo 1981 Carta Luiz Villares.jpg|thumb|right]]
Zeiger participated from the beginning in the textile fairs established by Caio de Alcântara Machado (FENIT), the board of directors of the International Art Biennial of São Paulo&lt;ref&gt;''(In Portuguese)'' XVI Bienal de São Paulo, ''http://issuu.com/bienal/docs/nameafc024'', Homenagem da Fundação Bienal de São Paulo, 16 outubro a 20 de dezembro de 1981&lt;/ref&gt; , and sponsored a project aimed at integrating a cultural center with theaters and concert halls in the [[Ibirapuera Park]]. He was also an art collector. In his view, the city of São Paulo had the potential to become the most important metropolis in [[Latin America]].

'''Dublin Chamber of Commerce''' is the largest [[chamber of commerce]] in Ireland with over 1,300 member companies. Since its foundation in 1783, Dublin Chamber of Commerce has sought to bring business people together to share ideas, to form a single voice for the local business community and to ultimately connect and grow business. The membership of Dublin Chamber employs an estimated 350,000 employees from across more than 50 industry sectors, ranging from sole trader businesses to multinational corporations. This means that Dublin Chamber is the most representative and broadly-based business group in the Greater Dublin Area.

Dublin Chamber has its ‘home’ at 7 Clare Street, Dublin 2. The current Chief Executive of Dublin Chamber is Mary Rose Burke. The 2014 President is Martin Murphy, Managing Director of Hewlett-Packard Ireland, who was succeeded in 2015 by Greg Clarke, Managing Director of Digicom.

==Origins==
Dublin Chamber is one of the oldest such organisation in Europe. The Chamber was founded in 1783, having been preceded by other collective bodies including the Guild of Merchants, which dated from the mediaeval period, and the Ouzel Galley Society, established at the beginning of the 18th century. Dublin Chamber's formation followed a weakening of the merchant guild system which left an opening for bodies which advocated free trade. Much of the focus of the Chamber in its early years was on abolishing impositions and opposing restrictions on export trade.

The creation of Dublin Chamber led to the formation of other chambers of commerce around Ireland, including Waterford (1787), Londonderry (1790), Limerick (1807) and Cork (1814). By 1819 there were 19 chambers of commerce operating in Britain and Ireland - a figure which rose to more than 90 by 1900. The first British federation, the Association of Chambers of Commerce, began in 1860 and included the Irish chambers. Following independence, Chambers in Ireland became members of the Association of Irish Chambers of Commerce, a body now known as Chambers Ireland.

==Current Chamber Offering==
The Chamber helps members to network with other businesses, maximise and grow their business and help them to understand the driving forces behind the future shape of the Greater Dublin Area. The Chamber's range of business services include:

*'''Networking and learning events''': Dublin Chamber's events programme caters for businesses of all types and size. These include around 60 networking events each year. A highlight of the Chamber's events programme is the Annual Dinner, which is held each October and attracts more than 1,600 attendees. Previous keynote speakers at the Dublin Chamber Annual Dinner include Denis O'Brien, Bloomberg's Dan Doctoroff, Willie Walsh of International Airlines Group, newsreader Trevor McDonald OBE and Ken Livingstone, politician and former Mayor of London.
*'''Business advisory services''': Dublin Chamber holds regular training programmes on a wide range of topics, such as procurement, business growth, green economy and sustainable development. Several business missions are also held each year to San Jose, London and Brussels.
* '''International trade documentation''': The Export Services department in Dublin Chamber offers exporters a fully licensed certification service for ATA Carnets and Certificates of Origin, as well as visas for business, tourist or transit travel and legalisation of export documents. The department can also provide information on export regulations and customs requirements.
*'''Policy consultations''': Dublin Chamber's policy work focuses on developing the Dublin region’s infrastructure and transport, promoting competitiveness and improving local governance. The Chamber's policy team is active in the following strategic areas: access to finance for SMEs, commercial rates, water charges, labour costs, public procurement reform, enterprise development policy. Dublin Chamber is also involved in Activating Dublin, a joint initiative with Dublin City Council which aims to generate growth and employment in the Dublin region.

==Archival Material==
*In 1983 a book, entitled ''''Princes &amp; Pirates: the Dublin Chamber of Commerce 1783-1983'''' and written by L.M.Cullen, was published by Dublin Chamber of Commerce which chronicled the first 200 years of the Chamber.
*A new updated history of Dublin Chamber is currently being written by Enda McMahon and is due to be published in October 2014.

'''Eight disciplines''' ('''8Ds''') '''problem solving''' is a method developed at [[Ford Motor Company]] used to approach and to resolve problems, typically employed by engineers or other professionals. Focused on product and process improvement, its purpose is to identify, correct, and eliminate recurring problems. It establishes a permanent corrective action based on statistical analysis of the problem and on the origin of the problem by determining the [[root cause]]s. Although it originally comprised eight stages, or 'disciplines', it was later augmented by an initial planning stage. 8D follows the logic of the [[PDCA cycle]]. The disciplines are:
  
:D0: '''Preparation and Emergency Response Actions''': Plan for solving the problem and determine the prerequisites.  Provide Emergency response Actions
:D1: '''Use a Team''': Establish a team of people with product/process knowledge.
:D2: '''Describe the Problem''': Specify the problem by identifying in quantifiable terms the who, what, where, when, why, how, and how many (5W2H) for the problem.
:D3: '''Develop Interim Containment Plan''': Define and implement containment actions to isolate the problem from any customer.
:D4: '''Determine and Verify Root Causes and Escape Points''': Identify all applicable causes that could explain why the problem has occurred. Also identify why the problem was not noticed at the time it occurred. All causes shall be verified or proved. One can use [[five whys]] or [[Ishikawa diagram]]s to map causes against the effect or problem identified.
:D5: '''Verify Permanent Corrections (PCs) for Problem will resolve problem for the customer''': Using pre-production programs, quantitatively confirm that the selected correction will resolve the problem. (Verify that the correction will actually solve the problem.)
:D6: '''Define and Implement Corrective Actions''': Define and Implement the best corrective actions.
:D7: '''Prevent Recurrence / System Problems''': Modify the management systems, operation systems, practices, and procedures to prevent recurrence of this and similar problems.
:D8: '''Congratulate the Main Contributors to your Team''': Recognize the collective efforts of the team. The team needs to be formally thanked by the organization.
8Ds has become a standard in the automotive,&lt;ref&gt;[http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/eight-disciplines-8d/index.html Eight Disciplines (8D)]&lt;/ref&gt; assembly, and other industries that require a thorough structured problem-solving process using a team approach.

==Ford Motor Company's team-oriented problem solving==

The executives of the Powertrain Organization ([[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]s, [[chassis]], [[engine]]s) wanted a methodology where teams (design engineering, manufacturing engineering, and production) could work on recurring chronic problems. In 1986, the assignment was given to develop a manual and a subsequent course that would achieve a new approach to solving identified engineering design and manufacturing problems. The manual for this methodology was documented and defined in ''Team Oriented Problem Solving'' (TOPS), first published in 1987. The manual and subsequent course material were piloted at [[Ford World Headquarters]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]].  Ford refers to their current variant as G8D (Global 8D). The Ford 8Ds manual is extensive and covers chapter by chapter how to go about addressing, quantifying, and resolving engineering issues. It begins with a cross-functional team and concludes with a successful demonstrated resolution of the problem. Containment actions may or may not be needed based on where the problem occurred in the life cycle of the product.

==Usage==

Many disciplines are typically involved in the "8Ds" methodology.  The tools used can be found in textbooks and reference materials used by [[quality assurance]] professionals. For example, an "Is/Is Not" worksheet is a common tool employed at D2, and Ishikawa, or "fishbone," diagrams and "5-why analysis" are common tools employed at step D4.
In the late 1990s, Ford developed a revised version of the 8D process that they call "Global 8D" (G8D), which is the current global standard for Ford and many other companies in the automotive supply chain. The major revisions to the process are as follows:

* Addition of a D0 (D-Zero) step as a gateway to the process. At D0, the team documents the symptoms that initiated the effort along with any emergency response actions (ERAs) that were taken before formal initiation of the G8D. D0 also incorporates standard assessing questions meant to determine whether a full G8D is required. The assessing questions are meant to ensure that in a world of limited problem-solving resources, the efforts required for a full team-based problem-solving effort are limited to those problems that warrant these resources.
* Addition of the notion of escape points to D4 through D6. An 'escape point' is the earliest control point in the control system following the root cause of a problem that should have detected that problem but failed to do so. The idea here is to consider not only the root cause, but also what went wrong with the control system in allowing this problem to escape. Global 8D requires the team to identify and verify an escape point at D4. Then, through D5 and D6, the process requires the team to choose, verify, implement, and validate permanent corrective actions to address the escape point.

Recently, the 8D process has been employed significantly outside the auto industry. As part of lean initiatives and continuous-improvement processes it is employed extensively in the food manufacturing, health care, and high-tech manufacturing industries.

==Benefits==

The benefits of the 8D methodology include effective approaches to finding a [[root cause]], developing proper actions to eliminate root causes, and implementing the permanent corrective action. The system also helps to explore the [[control system]]s that allowed the problem to escape. The Escape Point is studied for the purpose of improving the ability of the Control System to detect the failure or cause when and if it should occur again.
Finally the Prevention Loop explores the systems that permitted the condition that allowed the Failure and Cause Mechanism to exist in the first place.

==Prerequisites==

Requires training in the 8D [[Problem solving|problem-solving]] process as well as appropriate data collection and analysis tools such as [[Pareto chart]]s, fishbone diagrams, and process maps.

==Problem solving tools==

The following tools can be used within 8D:
* [[Ishikawa diagram]]s also known as cause-and-effect or fishbone diagrams
* [[Pareto chart]]s or Pareto diagrams
* [[5 Whys]]
* 5W and 2H (who, what, where, when, why, how, how often)
* [[Statistical process control]]
* [[Scatter plot]]s
* [[Design of experiments]]
* [[Check sheet]]
* [[Histograms]]
* [[Failure mode and effects analysis|FMEA]]
* [[Flowchart]]s or [[process map]]s

==Background of common corrective actions to dispose of nonconforming items==

The 8D methodology was first described in a Ford manual in 1987. The manual describes the eight-step methodology to address chronic product and process problems.  The 8Ds included several concepts of effective problem solving, including taking corrective actions and containing nonconforming items. These two steps have been very common in most manufacturing facilities, including government and military installations. In 1974, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) released “MIL-STD 1520 Corrective Action and Disposition System for Nonconforming Material”. This 13 page standard defines establishing some corrective actions and then taking containment actions on nonconforming material or items. It is focused on inspection for defects and disposing of them. The basic idea of corrective actions and containment of defectives was officially abolished in 1995, but these concepts were also common to Ford Motor Company, a major supplier to the government in World War II. Corrective actions and containment of poor quality parts were part of the manual and course for the automotive industry and are well known to many companies. Ford's 60 page manual covers details associated with each step in their 8D problem solving manual and the actions to take to deal with identified problems.

===Military usage===

The exact history of the 8D method remains disputed as many publications and websites state that it originates from the US military. Indeed, MIL-STD-1520C &lt;ref&gt;http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-1500-1599/MIL-STD-1520C_NOTICE-2_23481/&lt;/ref&gt; outlines a set of requirements for their contractors on how they should organize themselves with respect to non-conforming materials. Developed in 1974 and cancelled  in February 1995 as part of the Perry memo,&lt;ref&gt;https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=32397&lt;/ref&gt; you can compare it best to the ISO 9001 standard that currently exists as it expresses the same philosophy. The aforementioned military standard does outline some aspects that are in the 8D method, however, it does not provide the same structure that the 8D methodology offers. Taking into account the fact that the Ford Motor Company played an instrumental role in producing army vehicles during the Second World War and in the decades after, it could very well be the case that the MIL-STD-1520C stood as a model for today’s 8D method.&lt;ref&gt;8D Problem solving explained – Turning operational failures into knowledge to drive your strategic and competitive advantages&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship between 8D and FMEA==

[[Failure mode and effects analysis|FMEA]] (failure mode and effect analysis) is a tool generally used in the planning of product or process design. The relationships between 8D and FMEA are outlined below:
# The problem statements and descriptions are sometimes linked between both documents. An 8D can utilize pre-brainstormed information from a FMEA to assist in looking for potential problems.
# Possible causes in a FMEA can immediately be used to jump start 8D Fishbone or [[Ishikawa diagrams]]. Brainstorming information that is already known is not a good use of time or resources.
# Data and brainstorming collected during an 8D can be placed into a FMEA for future planning of new product or process quality. This allows a FMEA to consider actual failures, occurring as failure modes and causes, becoming more effective and complete.
# The design or process controls in a FMEA can be used in verifying the root cause and Permanent Corrective Action in an 8D.
The FMEA and 8D should reconcile each failure and cause by cross documenting failure modes, problem statements and possible causes. Each FMEA can be used as a database of possible causes of failure as an 8D is developed.

'''Eric B. Dent''', Ph.D. holds the Uncommon Friends Endowed Chair in Ethics at Florida Gulf Coast University. Earlier in his career he served as the Dean of the School of Business at the [[University of North Carolina at Pembroke]] and has made important contributions to many topics, such as the resistance to change and [[Complexity theory and organizations|Complexity Theory]].

==Life==
Eric Dent was raised in [[Boca Raton, Florida]], where he attended [[Saint Andrew's School (Boca Raton, Florida)|St. Andrew's School]]. After graduating, he attended Emory University, receiving M.S. and B.S. degrees in Computer Science. Dent then moved to Gaithersburg, Maryland where he worked for IBM, designing satellite communication systems. For several years Dent worked as a management consultant with Macro International. As Technical Director, he managed over $10 million of training and development contracts with the federal government. He most frequently consulted with [[The Royal Bank of Canada]], The [[United States Navy]], and [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]]. Dent later served as Vice President, Operations and General Manager of the Washington, DC office of the [[Todd Organization]], a national executive compensation consulting firm.

In 1993, Dent founded Always Improvement, a management consulting firm dedicated to organizational improvement. His recent work has been in the areas of executive coaching, organizational change, team-building, conflict resolution, strategic planning, [[total quality management]], leadership, and business process assessment.

Dr. Dent holds an M.B.A with a major in Organizational Behavior and Development and a minor in Finance.  Mid-career, he began his doctoral work, receiving a Ph.D in Management and Organization from the School of Business and Public Management at George Washington University.  During this time, he taught as an adjunct professor at the [[University of Maryland University College]], where he would later become the Executive Director of the Doctoral Programs.

During 2002-2003 Dent co-hosted LeaderTalk, a radio talk show in which CEOs and other thought leaders were interviewed about their business wisdom.

He began his tenure as Dean of the School of Business at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke in 2003 and ended 2008. His tenure was marked by major strides in faculty diversity and credentials, a large increase in international students, the establishment of an entrepreneurial center, and many other accomplishments.

He left the University of North Carolina at Pembroke for [[Fayetteville State University]] in 2012, where he served as professor of leadership and chair of the faculty senate. In 2016 he moved to [[Florida Gulf Coast University]], where he now holds the Uncommon Friends Endowed Chair in Ethics.

Dr. Dent has twice visited [[Cuba]], lecturing at the Biennial Seminar on the Philosophical, [[Epistemological]] and Methodological Implications of Complexity Theory conference, the second time speaking on "The Challenges of Observation, Inquiry, and Measurement in Complexity Theory."

Dent is a lifelong Methodist, previously attending Chestnut Street [[United Methodist Church|UMC]] when he resided in [[Lumberton, NC]].  He was also active in various groups in [[Robeson County]], such as the Robeson Community Foundation, Robeson Economic Forum, and the Chamber of Commerce.

'''Firestone Natural Rubber Company, LLC''' is a subsidiary of the [[Bridgestone| Bridgestone Americas, Inc]]. Headquartered in [[Nashville, TN]], the company operates the largest contiguous rubber plantation in the world in [[Liberia]], which first opened in 1926.

==History==

===Creation and early history===
During the 1920s, the United States access to [[rubber]] was restricted by the European colonial powers (Britain and the Netherlands), which held a monopoly in rubber production.&lt;ref name="AfrDict"&gt;Robert Anthony Waters Jr, ''Historical Dictionary of United States-Africa Relations'', Scarecrow Press, 2009, {{ISBN|9780810862913}}, p. 103-104&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Hoover]], then Secretary of Commerce, considered rubber a vital resource due to its usage for car tires and began working with American rubber companies in order to find a rubber source that was controlled by US interests.&lt;ref name="AfrDict"/&gt; Part of a Department of Commerce-subsidised worldwide search for a place for rubber plantations, rubber magnate [[Harvey Samuel Firestone]] sent experts to Liberia in December 1923 to do a soil survey.&lt;ref name="AfrDict"/&gt;

In 1926, the Liberian government granted Firestone a 99-year lease for a million acres (to be chosen by the company wherever in Liberia) at a price of 6 cents per acre,&lt;ref name="dubois"&gt;W. E. Burghardt Du Bois, "[http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/69368/w-e-burghardt-du-bois/liberia-the-league-and-the-united-states Liberia, the League and the United States]", ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', July 1931&lt;/ref&gt; Firestone then set about establishing rubber tree plantations of the non-native South American rubber tree, [[Hevea brasiliensis]] in the country, eventually creating the world's largest rubber plantation.&lt;ref name="AfrDict"/&gt; Firestone also provided a $5 million loan at a 7% interest rate&lt;ref name="dubois"/&gt; to the government to pay the foreign debts it had &lt;ref name="AfrDict"/&gt; and to build a harbour needed by Firestone.&lt;ref name="dubois"/&gt; The loan was given in exchange for complete authority over the government's revenues until the loan was paid.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenau, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The loan took a larger and larger portion of the Liberian government's incomes: it grew from 20% of the total revenue of Liberia in 1929, to 32% in 1930, to 54.9% in 1931 and nearly the whole revenue in 1932.&lt;ref name="dubois"/&gt; An estimation made by a member of the American Legation in Liberia said that Liberia really paid a 17% interest rate for the loan.&lt;ref name="dubois"/&gt;

During the [[Great Depression]], as rubber price fell,&lt;ref name="dubois"/&gt; Firestone stopped its development of the plantation (using just 50,000 acres and cutting wages in half), and, depriving the Liberian government of tax incomes, the government missed a payment to the loans to the company. Firestone asked the US government to send a warship to [[Monrovia]] to enforce the debt payment, but President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] rejected the "gunboat diplomacy".&lt;ref name="AfrDict"/&gt; The loans to the company were finally paid in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenau, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===During the civil wars===
As rubber demand went down during the 1980s, Firestone dismissed a number of 5000 workers, leading to the local antipathy to the company.&lt;ref name="Rosenau20"&gt;Rosenau, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, 1990, during the [[First Liberian Civil War]], the resistance group [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] took over the Firestone plantation and evacuated US personnel.&lt;ref name="Rosenau20"/&gt; The exact nature of Firestone's activities in the plantation between 1990 and 1997 is unclear, the government's official stance was that they were able to take it back within a few months,&lt;ref name="Rosenau20"/&gt; while media reports say that it was not operational until late 1994.&lt;ref name="Rosenau21"&gt;Rosenau, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, after the violence was over, the company restarted the operations, at first at a third of capacity, with 3000 workers.&lt;ref name="Rosenau21"/&gt; The company soon faced a number of violent protests, as its employees wanted better working conditions, better pay and resettlement benefits.&lt;ref name="Rosenau21"/&gt; By October 2008, it was operating at half the capacity, withholding further investments until the government finally agreed to give the company a lenient tax status.&lt;ref name="Rosenau22"&gt;Rosenau, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current operations===

In 2005, the Firestone Company and the Liberian government signed a new 37-year deal raising the lease to 50 cents per acre.&lt;ref name="AfrDict"/&gt;

==Labor controversy==
The workers accuse the company of serious labor abuses, including exploitative [[child labor]], which they claim amount to modern-day [[slavery]].&lt;ref name="UNMIL Rubber, indicated pages"/&gt;  Workers specifically claim that Firestone's high daily quotas force them to employ their own children, subjecting them to grueling and dangerous work conditions.  In response to the claims, the president of Firestone Natural Rubber told a [[CNN]] interviewer that "each tapper will tap about 650 trees a day, where they spend perhaps a couple of minutes at each tree." As the network pointed out, this would add up to more than 21 hours of work per day.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web
| title =Is Bridgestone/Firestone Exploiting Liberian Workers? | publisher=CNN| url =http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0511/12/i_if.01.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, the [[United Nations Mission in Liberia]] (UNMIL) released a report detailing the state of [[human rights]] on Liberia's rubber plantations.&lt;ref name="UNMIL Rubber, indicated pages"/&gt; According to the report, Firestone managers in Liberia admitted that the company does not effectively monitor its own policy prohibiting child labor.  UNMIL found that several factors contribute to the occurrence of child labor on Firestone plantations: pressure to meet company quotas, incentive to support the family financially, and lack of access to basic education.&lt;ref name="UNMIL Rubber, indicated pages"/&gt;

===Alien Tort Claims Act===
In November 2005, the [[International Labor Rights Fund]], representing "tappers" (workers who extract [[latex]] from [[Hevea brasiliensis|rubber trees]]) on the Liberian plantation, filed an [[Alien Tort Statute|Alien Tort Claims Act]] (ATCA) case in US District Court in California against [[Bridgestone]] (parent company owning Firestone), alleging "forced labor, the modern equivalent of slavery", on the [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] Plantation in [[Harbel]], [[Liberia]].&lt;ref name="Claim against Firestone"&gt;{{cite web|title=Firestone Claim|work=socialfunds.com|url=http://www.socialfunds.com/news/article.cgi/1897.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawsuit stated: {{cquote|The Plantation workers allege, among other things, that they remain trapped by poverty and coercion on a frozen-in-time Plantation operated by Firestone in a manner identical to how the Plantation was operated when it was first opened by Firestone in 1926.}}

Firestone rejected these allegations, stating that the corporation has provided employment and pensions to thousands of Liberians as well as healthcare. The company also provides education and training opportunities to employees and their children.&lt;ref name = "Firestone Briefing"&gt;{{cite web|title =Firestone Briefing|work =lantos.house.org|url =http://lantos.house.gov/HoR/CA12/Human+Rights+Caucus/HRC+Hidden+Content/12-09-05+Liberia+and+Firestone+Briefing.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reply to the charge of exploitative [[child labor]], Management of the plantation claims that workers are bringing their own children to work to assist them and that this is not endorsed by the plantation management.

Workers claim that management's high daily quotas force them to employ their own children as their only means of meeting quotas.

Even though Liberia does have child labor laws and Firestone has banned children from tapping trees, workers say the ban is not enforced. The workers say the only way they can complete their daily quota is to bring their children along.

Firestone management says if children are found helping their parents, the employees are cancelled, and if necessary, disciplined. "We have very strict policies about our child labor. We do not hire anybody under 18 years of age, and we discourage parents from bringing their children to the fields with them."&lt;ref name = "CNNtranscript"&gt;{{cite web
| title =Liberian Controversy
| work =cnn.com
| url =http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0511/12/i_if.01.html
| accessdate=2006-07-30
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firestone requested to transfer the case to [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], from California and this request was granted in April 2006.

===UN report===
In May 2006, the [[United Nations Mission in Liberia]] (UNMIL) released a report: "Human Rights in Liberia’s Rubber Plantations: Tapping into the Future".&lt;ref name="UNMIL Rubber, indicated pages"&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights in Liberia's Rubber Plantations: Tapping into the Future|publisher=United Nations Mission in Liberia (2006)|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/473dade10.html|accessdate=2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the report, Firestone managers in Liberia admitted that the company does not effectively monitor its own policy prohibiting child labor. UNMIL found that several factors contribute to the occurrence of child labor on Firestone plantations: pressure to meet company quotas, incentive to support the family financially, and lack of access to basic education. The report also noted that workers' housing provided by Firestone has not been renovated since the houses were constructed in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name="UNMIL Rubber, indicated pages"/&gt;

In response to the accusations of [[child labor]] and poor housing in the UN report, Dan Adomitis, President of Firestone Natural Rubber Company Liberia, stated: 
{{cquote| Well, in addition to the devastation that 15 years of civil war has caused, I think you need to understand another point—during the 2003 fighting, we had thousands of refugees come to Harbel for the safety that it provided. When those people came, they occupied any open area of land that was available. They put up temporary housing made out of mud, out of bamboo, out of thatch, out of tarpaulin, out of corrugated steel. Anything that they could do to get shelter. And those conditions still exist. They are not Firestone housing, but they are on our property.&lt;ref name = "CNN"/&gt;...

We have very strict policies about child labor. We do not hire anybody under 18 years of age, and we discourage parents from bringing their children to the fields with them. We have a program with the Ministry of Labor in Liberia to - and also the union that represents our employees—to educate parents about why they should not bring children with them into the field. And if we see incidents of this, we will cancel those employees, and if necessary, ultimately discipline them over such issue.&lt;ref name="CNNtranscript"/&gt;}}

'''Fleet management''' is the management of:
* Commercial [[motor vehicle]]s such as [[car]]s, [[van]]s, [[truck]]s, specialist vehicles (such as mobile construction machinery), and trailers  
* Private vehicles used for work purposes (the 'grey fleet'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/grey-fleet/ What is the grey fleet]&lt;/ref&gt;) 
* Aviation machinery such as [[aircraft]] ([[Airplane|plane]]s and [[helicopter]]s) 
* Ships 
* [[railroad car|Rail cars]]. 
Fleet (vehicle) management can include a range of functions, such as vehicle financing, vehicle maintenance, vehicle [[telematics]] (tracking and diagnostics), driver management, speed management, fuel management and health and safety management. Fleet Management is a function which allows companies which rely on transportation in  business to remove or minimize the risks associated with vehicle investment, improving [[Business efficiency|efficiency]], [[productivity]] and reducing their overall transportation and staff costs, providing 100% compliance with government legislation (duty of care) and many more. These functions can be dealt with by either an in-house fleet-management department or an outsourced fleet-management provider. According to market research from the independent analyst firm Berg Insight, the number of fleet management units deployed in commercial fleets in [[Europe]] will grow from 3.05 million units at the end of 2012 to 6.40 million in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berginsight.com/reportpdf/productsheet/bi-fm8-ps.pdf Berg Insight, "Fleet Management in Europe]&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the overall penetration level is just a few percent, some segments such as road transport will attain adoption rates above 31 percent.

The most basic functions in all fleet management systems, is the [[Vehicle tracking system|vehicle tracking]] component. This component is usually [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]-based, but sometimes it can be based on [[GLONASS]] or a [[cellular network|cellular]] [[triangulation]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;About.com, [http://cartech.about.com/od/Safety/a/What-Is-Vehicle-Tracking.htm What is vehicle tracking?]&lt;/ref&gt;  Once vehicle location, direction and speed are determined from the GPS components, additional tracking capabilities transmit this information to a fleet management software application.  Methods for data transmission include both terrestrial and satellite.  [[GPS satellite|Satellite tracking]] communications, while more expensive, are critical if vehicle tracking is to work in remote environments without interruption. Users can see actual, real-time locations of their fleet on a map. This is often used to quickly respond on events in the field.

==Mechanical diagnostics==
An advanced fleet management systems ([[Fleet_Management_System|FMS]]) can connect to the vehicle's [[Horn Control Unit|onboard computer]], and gather data for the user. Data such as mileage and [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel consumption]] are gathered into a global statistics scheme.

==Driver behavior==
Highly developed fleet management and vehicle [[telematics]] systems collect a full range of data in real-time and for transport and fleet managers. By combining received data from the vehicle tracking system and the on-board computer, it is possible to form a profile for any given [[driver (person)|driver]] (average speed, frequency of detours, breaks, severity of manoeuvres, choice of gears, etc.). This data can be used to highlight drivers with dangerous habits and to suggest remedial training applicable to the issues, or to ensure that drivers are meeting [[Performance_indicator|KPI]]s.

==Fleet management software==
{{Details|Fleet management software}}

[[Fleet management software]] enables people to accomplish a series of specific tasks in the management of any or all aspects relating to a company's fleet of vehicles. These specific tasks encompass all operations from vehicle acquisition to disposal. Software, depending on its capabilities, allows functions such as recording driver and vehicle details, the tracking of procurement costs, scheduling of maintenance and servicing tasks, import of fuel transactions, and measuring of fleet performance via reports and charts.

==Management of ships==
Fleet management also refers to the management of ships while at sea. Shipping fleet management contracts are normally given to fleet management companies that handle aspects like crewing, maintenance, and day-to-day operations. This gives the ship owner time to concentrate on [[cargo]] booking.

==Fleet security and control==
Recent advances in fleet management allow for the addition of [[Wireless|over-the-air]] (OTA) security and control of fleet vehicles.  Fleet Security and Control includes security of the vehicle while stopped or not in operation and the ability to safely disable a vehicle while in operation.  This allows the fleet manager to recover stolen or rogue vehicles while reducing the chance of lost or stolen cargo. The additional of Fleet Security and Control to a fleet management system gives a [[fleet card]] manager preventative measures to address cargo damage and loss.

===Remote vehicle disabling systems===

Remote vehicle disabling systems provide  users at remote locations the ability to prevent an engine from starting, prevent movement of a vehicle, and to stop or slow an operating vehicle. Remote disabling allows a dispatcher or other authorized personnel to gradually decelerate a vehicle by downshifting, limiting the throttle capability, or bleeding air from the braking system from a remote location. Some of these systems provide advance notification to the driver that the vehicle disabling is about to occur. After stopping a vehicle, some systems will lock the vehicle's brakes or will not allow the vehicle's engine to be restarted within a certain time-frame.

Remote disabling systems can also be integrated into a remote panic and [[emergency notification system]]. In an emergency, a driver can send an emergency alert by pressing a panic button on the dashboard, or by using a key-fob panic button if the driver is within close proximity of the truck. Then, the carrier or other approved organization can be remotely alerted to allow a dispatcher or other authorized personnel to evaluate the situation, communicate with the driver, and/or potentially disable the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, [http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/facts-research/systems-technology/product-guides/vehicle-disabling.htm Vehicle Disabling Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221084256/http://@fmcsa.dot.gov/facts-research/systems-technology/product-guides/vehicle-disabling.htm |date=2013-02-21 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fleet replacement and lifecycle management==
The timely replacement of vehicles and equipment is a process that requires the ability to predict asset lifecycles based on costing information, utilization, and asset age. Organizations prefer to use new fleet as a strategy for cost reduction where the used fleet is sold so that a new fleet is maintained.

Funding requirements are also an issue, because many organizations, especially government, purchase vehicles with cash. The ad hoc nature and traditional low funding levels with cash has put many operations in an aged fleet. This lack of adequate funding for replacement can also result in higher maintenance costs due to aged vehicles.

==Duty of care==
In the UK, in April 2008, the Corporate [[Manslaughter]] Act was strengthened to target company directors as well as their drivers in cases of road deaths involving vehicles used on business. The Police have said they now treat every road death as ‘an unlawful killing’ and have the power to seize company records and computers during their investigations. They will bring prosecutions against company directors who fail to provide clear policies and guidance for their employees driving at work.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}Unfortunately, in the UK a number of businesses are failing to meet their duty of care.In particular prosecutions can be brought against company directors for failing to meet their duty of care and allowing HGV driver hours to exceed the legal limits. Failure to comply with EU rules can result in a fixed penalty of up to £300, a graduated deposit of up to £1500 or you could be summoned to court. 
Directors and business owners may not be aware that privately owned vehicles used for business journeys are treated exactly the same as company owned vehicles. Directors have an equal responsibility under the law to ensure these vehicles are also roadworthy and correctly insured.
It is vital that every company has a ‘Driving at Work’ policy in place covering every element of their business vehicle operation, no matter how few vehicles are involved and who owns them. Every employee driving for business is required to sign up to the policy.  In this way the directors can reduce the risk of being prosecuted and a possible custodial sentence.

The '''hype cycle''' is a branded graphical presentation developed and used by the American research, advisory and [[information technology]] firm [[Gartner]], for representing the maturity, adoption and social application of specific [[Technology|technologies]]. The hype cycle provides a graphical and conceptual presentation of the maturity of emerging technologies through five phases.

An example of a hype cycle is found in ''Amara's law''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://spotlessdata.com/blog/amaras-law|title=Amara's Law|publisher=|accessdate=April 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410135130/https://spotlessdata.com/blog/amaras-law|archive-date=April 10, 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; coined by [[Roy Amara]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2012/09/05/Four-Geeky-Laws-That-Rule-Our-World/ |title=Four Geeky Laws That Rule Our World |first1=Alex |last1=Santoso |date=September 5, 2012|publisher=Neatorama |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that &lt;blockquote&gt;We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.&lt;ref name=PC_Mag&gt;{{cite journal|title=Encyclopedia: Definition of: Amara's law|journal=PC Magazine|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/37701/amara-s-law|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isen.com/archives/011126.html|title=isen.com: Amara's Law -- SMART Letter #63|publisher=|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Five phases==
[[File:Hype-Cycle-General.png|thumb|right|320px|General hype cycle for technology]]

Each hype cycle drills down into the five key phases of a technology's life cycle.

{|class="wikitable"
!align=center|No.
!align=center width=180px|Phase
!align=center|Description
|-
!align=center|1
|Technology Trigger
|A potential technology breakthrough kicks things off. Early proof-of-concept stories and media interest trigger significant publicity. Often no usable products exist and commercial viability is unproven.
|-
!align=center|2
|Peak of Inflated Expectations
|Early publicity produces a number of success stories—often accompanied by scores of failures. Some companies take action; most don't.
|-
!align=center|3
|Trough of Disillusionment
|Interest wanes as experiments and implementations fail to deliver. Producers of the technology shake out or fail. Investment continues only if the surviving providers improve their products to the satisfaction of early adopters.
|-
!align=center|4
|Slope of Enlightenment
|More instances of how the technology can benefit the enterprise start to crystallize and become more widely understood. Second- and third-generation products appear from technology providers. More enterprises fund pilots; conservative companies remain cautious.
|-
!align=center|5
|Plateau of Productivity
|Mainstream adoption starts to take off. Criteria for assessing provider viability are more clearly defined. The technology's broad market applicability and relevance are clearly paying off. If the technology has more than a niche market then it will continue to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital marketing|last=1963-|first=Chaffey, Dave|publisher=Pearson|others=Ellis-Chadwick, Fiona|year=2016|isbn=9781292077611|edition= Sixth |location=Harlow|pages=140–141|oclc=942844494}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|}
The term "hype cycle" and each of the associated phases are now used more broadly in the [[marketing]] of new technologies.

==Hype in new media==
Hype (in the more general media sense of the term "hype"&lt;ref name=Flew_Newmedia /&gt;) plays a large part in the adoption of [[new media]] forms by society. [[Terry Flew]] states{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} that hype (generally the enthusiastic and strong feeling around new forms of media and technology in which people expect everything will be modified for the better{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}) surrounding [[new media]] technologies and their popularization, along with the development of the Internet, is a common characteristic. But following shortly after the period of 'inflated expectations', as per the diagram above, the new media technologies quickly fall into a period of disenchantment, which is the end of the primary, and strongest, phase of hype.

Many analyses of the Internet in the 1990s featured large amounts of hype,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Negroponte |first=Nicolas |title=Being Digital |publisher=Vintage |date=1996-01-03 |edition= 1st |isbn= 978-0-679-76290-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Kelly |first=Kevin |title=New Rules For The New Economy |journal=Wired |date=1997-09-01 |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.09/newrules.html |accessdate=2011-12-30 |volume=5.09 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Dyson |first=Esther |title=Release 2.0: A Design For Living In The Digital Age |publisher=Broadway Books |location=New York |year=1997 |edition= 1st}}
&lt;/ref&gt; which created "debunking" responses.&lt;ref name=Flew_Newmedia&gt;{{cite book |last=Flew |first=Terry |title=New Media: An Introduction |publisher=OUP Australia and New Zealand |location=South Melbourne |year=2008 |edition= 3rd |isbn=978-0-19-555149-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such hype and the negative and positive responses toward it have given way to research that looks empirically at new media and its impact.

A longer-term historical perspective on such cycles can be found in the research of the economist [[Carlota Perez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henton|first=Doug|last2=Held|first2=Kim|date=2013|title=The dynamics of Silicon Valley: Creative destruction and the evolution of the innovation habitat|journal=Social Science Information|language=en|volume=52|issue=4|pages=539–557|doi=10.1177/0539018413497542|issn=0539-0184}}&lt;/ref&gt; D R Laurence in clinical pharmacology described a similar process in drug development in the seventies.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Another is that it is limited in its application, as it prioritizes economic considerations in decision-making processes. It seems to assume that a business' performance is tied to the hype cycle, whereas this may actually have more to do with the way a company devises its branding strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rootbranded.com/mindshift-magazine/branding-strategy-cut-hype-cycles|title=RootBranded {{!}} Mindshift Magazine|website=RootBranded {{!}} Saving Great Ideas from Obscurity|language=en|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related criticism is that the "cycle" has no real benefits to the development or marketing of new technologies and merely comments on pre-existing trends. Specific disadvantages when compared to, for example, [[technology readiness level]] are:
* The cycle is not scientific in nature, and there is no data or analysis that would justify the cycle.
* With the (subjective) terms ''disillusionment'', ''enlightenment'' and ''expectations'' it can not be described objectively or clearly where technology now really is.
* The terms are misleading in the sense that one gets the wrong idea what he or she can use a technology for. The user does not want to be disappointed, so should he or she stay away from technology in the Trough of Disillusionment?
* No action perspective is offered to move technology to a next phase.
* This appears to be a very simplified impulse response of an elastic system representable by a differential equation.  Perhaps more telling would be to formulate a system model with solutions conforming to observable behavior.
An analysis of Gartner Hype Cycles since 2000&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; shows that few technologies actually travel through an identifiable hype cycle, and that in practice most of the important technologies adopted since 2000 were not identified early in their adoption cycles.

[[File:Woodchips for paper production.jpg|thumb|250px|Woodchips for paper production]]
The '''kraft process''' (also known as '''kraft pulping''' or '''sulfate process''')&lt;ref&gt;The process name is derived from German ''Kraft'',[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kraft] meaning "strength" in this context, due to the strength of the [[kraft paper]] produced using this process. Both capitalized and lowercase spelling ("Kraft process" and "kraft process") appear in the literature, but "kraft" is most commonly used in the [[pulp and paper industry]].&lt;/ref&gt; is a process for conversion of [[wood]] into [[wood pulp]], which consists of almost pure [[cellulose]] fibers, the main component of [[paper]]. The kraft process entails treatment of wood chips with a hot mixture of water, [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH), and [[sodium sulfide]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S), known as [[white liquor]], that breaks the bonds that link [[lignin]], [[hemicellulose]], and [[cellulose]].  The technology entails several steps, both mechanical and chemical.  It is the dominant method for producing paper.  In some situations, the process has been controversial because kraft plants can release odorous products and in some situations produce substantial liquid [[waste]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, E., Lyons, J., Boxall, J., Robertson, C., Lake, C. B., &amp; Walker, T. R. (2017). Spatiotemporal assessment (quarter century) of pulp mill metal (loid) contaminated sediment to inform remediation decisions. Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, 189(6), 257.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, E., Bernier, M., Blotnicky, B., Golden, P. G., Janes, J., Kader, A., ... &amp; Walker, T. R. (2015). Assessment of public perception and environmental compliance at a pulp and paper facility: a Canadian case study. Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, 187(12), 766.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Patt et al. "Paper and Pulp" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002 Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a18_545.pub4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The kraft process (so called because of the superior strength of the resulting paper, from the German word ''[[wikt:Kraft|Kraft]]'' for 'strength') was invented by [[Carl F. Dahl]] in 1879 in [[Gdańsk|Danzig]], [[Prussia]], [[German Empire|Germany]]. {{US patent|296935}} was issued in 1884, and a pulp mill using this technology started (in [[Sweden]]) in 1890.&lt;ref name="bier"&gt;{{cite book |last=Biermann |first=Christopher J. |authorlink= |title=Essentials of Pulping and Papermaking |year=1993 |publisher=Academic Press, Inc. |location=San Diego |isbn=0-12-097360-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of the [[recovery boiler]] by G. H. Tomlinson in the early 1930s was a milestone in the advancement of the kraft process.&lt;ref name="eero"&gt;{{cite book |author= E. Sjöström |title= Wood Chemistry: Fundamentals and Applications |publisher= [[Academic Press]]|year= 1993 |isbn= 0-12-647480-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It enabled the recovery and reuse of the inorganic pulping chemicals such that a kraft mill is a nearly closed-cycle process with respect to inorganic chemicals, apart from those used in the bleaching process. For this reason, in the 1940s, the kraft process superseded the [[sulfite process]] as the dominant method for producing wood pulp.&lt;ref name="bier"/&gt;

==The process==
[[Image:Pulp mill 2.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Continuous kraft pulp mill]]

===Impregnation===
Common [[wood chips]] used in pulp production are {{convert|12|-|25|mm|in}} long and {{convert|2|-|10|mm|in}} thick. The chips normally first enter the ''presteaming'' where they are wetted and preheated with [[steam]]. Cavities inside fresh wood chips are partly filled with liquid and partly with air. The steam treatment causes the air to expand and about 25% of the air to be expelled from the chips. The next step is to saturate the chips with [[Black liquor|black]] and [[white liquor]]. Air remaining in chips at the beginning of liquor impregnation is trapped within the chips. The impregnation can be done before or after the chips enters the digester and is normally done below {{convert|100|°C|°F}}. The cooking liquors consist of a mixture of white liquor, water in chips, condensed steam and weak black liquor. In the impregnation, cooking liquor penetrates into the capillary structure of the chips and low temperature chemical reactions with the wood begin. A good impregnation is important to get a homogeneous cook and low rejects. About 40–60% of all alkali consumption in the continuous process occurs in the impregnation zone.

===Cooking===
The wood chips are then cooked in pressurized vessels called digesters. Some digesters operate in a batch manner and some in a continuous process. There are several variations of the cooking processes both for the batch and the continuous digesters. Digesters producing 1,000 tonnes or more of pulp per day are common, with the largest producing more than 3,500 tonnes per day.&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.p2pays.org/ref%5C02%5C01128/01128.pdf |format=PDF|title=Pollution Prevention Technologies for the Bleached Kraft Segment of the U.S. Pulp and Paper Industry (see p 66) |accessdate=2007-09-11 |last=Woodman |first=Jocelyn |year=1993 |work= |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a continuous digester, the materials are fed at a rate that allows the pulping reaction to be complete by the time the materials exit the reactor. Typically, delignification requires several hours at {{convert|170|to|176|°C|°F}}. Under these conditions lignin and [[hemicellulose]] degrade to give fragments that are soluble in the strongly basic liquid. The solid pulp (about 50% by weight of the dry wood chips) is collected and washed. At this point the pulp is known as ''brown stock'' because of its color. The combined liquids, known as black liquor (because of its color), contain lignin fragments, [[carbohydrate]]s from the breakdown of hemicellulose, [[sodium carbonate]], [[sodium sulfate]] and other inorganic salts.

[[Image:KraftEq.png|250px|thumb|right|net reaction in depolymerization of lignin by SH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (Ar = [[aromaticity|aryl]], R = [[alkyl]] groups).]]
One of the main chemical reactions that underpin the kraft process is the scission of ether bonds by the [[nucleophilic]] [[sulfide]] (S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) or [[bisulfide]] (HS&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) ions.&lt;ref name="eero"/&gt;

===Recovery process===
The excess black liquor contains about 15% solids and is concentrated in a [[Multiple-effect evaporator|multiple effect evaporator]]. After the first step the black liquor has about 20–30% solids. At this concentration the [[rosin]] soap rises to the surface and is [[Skimmer (machine)|skimmed]] off. The collected soap is further processed to [[tall oil]]. Removal of the soap improves the evaporation operation of the later effects.

The weak black liquor is further evaporated to 65% or even 80% solids ("heavy black liquor"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sealspecialists.net/black%20liquor.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050420032421/http://www.sealspecialists.net/black%20liquor.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-04-20 |title=Equipment to handle heavy black liquor |accessdate=2007-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and burned in the [[recovery boiler]] to recover the inorganic chemicals for reuse in the pulping process. Higher solids in the concentrated black liquor increases the energy and chemical efficiency of the recovery cycle, but also gives higher viscosity and precipitation of solids (plugging and fouling of equipment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thor.lib.chalmers.se/inst_fack/kurser/keml/TK/materials/dc220.pdf |format=PDF |title=Second Critical Solids Black Liquor Scaling |accessdate=2007-10-09 |last=Hsieh |first=Jeffery S. |author2=Smith, Jason B. |work= |publisher=Pulp and Paper Engineering, School of Chemical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831033707/http://thor.lib.chalmers.se/inst_fack/kurser/keml/TK/materials/dc220.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent

:1. Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 C → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

This reaction is similar to [[thermochemical sulfate reduction]] in geochemistry.

The molten salts ("smelt") from the recovery boiler are dissolved in a process water known as "weak wash". This process water, also known as "weak white liquor" is composed of all liquors used to wash lime mud and [[green liquor]] precipitates. The resulting solution of sodium carbonate and sodium sulfide is known as "green liquor", although it is not known exactly what causes the liquor to be green. This liquid is mixed with [[calcium oxide]], which becomes [[calcium hydroxide]] in solution, to regenerate the white liquor used in the pulping process through an equilibrium reaction (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is shown since it is part of the green liquor, but does not participate in the reaction):

:2. Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ←→ Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 2 NaOH + CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Calcium carbonate]] precipitates from the white liquor and is recovered and heated in a [[lime kiln]] where it is converted to [[calcium oxide]] (lime).

:3. CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → CaO + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Calcium oxide (lime) is reacted with water to regenerate the calcium hydroxide used in Reaction 2:

:4. CaO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The combination of reactions 1 through 4 form a closed cycle with respect to sodium, sulfur and calcium and is the main concept of the so-called recausticizing process where [[sodium carbonate]] is reacted to regenerate [[sodium hydroxide]].

The recovery boiler also generates high pressure steam which is fed to turbogenerators, reducing the steam pressure for the mill use and generating [[electricity]]. A modern kraft pulp mill is more than self-sufficient in its electrical generation and normally will provide a net flow of energy which can be used by an associated paper mill or sold to neighboring industries or communities through to the local electrical grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, bark and wood residues are often burned in a separate power boiler to generate steam.

Although recovery boilers using G.H. Tomlinson's invention have been in general use since the early 1930s attempts have been made to find a more efficient process for the recovery of cooking chemicals. [[Weyerhaeuser]] has operated a [[Chemrec]] first generation [[black liquor]] [[gasification|entrained flow gasifier]] successfully at its [[New Bern]] plant in [[North Carolina]], while a second generation plant is run in pilot scale at [[Smurfit Kappa|Smurfit Kappa's]] plant in [[Piteå]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://chemrec.se/Chemrec-plants.aspx Chemrec web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blowing===
The finished cooked wood chips are blown to a collection tank called a blow tank that operates at atmospheric pressure. This releases a lot of steam and volatiles. The volatiles are condensed and collected; in the case of northern [[softwood]]s this consists mainly of raw [[turpentine]].

===Screening===
Screening of the pulp after pulping is a process whereby the pulp is separated from large [[Shives (papermaking)|shives]], [[Knots (papermaking)|knots]], dirt and other debris. The ''accept'' is the pulp. The material separated from the pulp is called ''reject''.

The screening section consists of different types of [[sieve]]s (screens) and centrifugal cleaning. The sieves are normally set up in a multistage cascade operation because considerable amounts of good fibres can go to the reject stream when trying to achieve maximum purity in the accept flow.

The fiber containing shives and knots are separated from the rest of the reject and reprocessed either in a refiner or is sent back to the digester. The content of knots is typically 0.5–3.0% of the digester output, while the shives content is about 0.1–1.0%.

===Washing===
The brownstock from the blowing goes to the washing stages where the used cooking liquors are separated from the cellulose fibers. Normally a pulp mill has 3-5 washing stages in series. Washing stages are also placed after oxygen delignification and between the bleaching stages as well. Pulp washers use counter current flow between the stages such that the pulp moves in the opposite direction to the flow of washing waters. Several processes are involved: [[thickening]] / [[Concentration|dilution]], [[displacement (fluid)|displacement]] and [[diffusion]]. The '''dilution factor''' is the measure of the amount of water used in washing compared with the theoretical amount required to displace the liquor from the thickened pulp. Lower dilution factor reduces energy consumption, while higher dilution factor normally gives cleaner pulp. Thorough washing of the pulp reduces the chemical oxygen demand ([[chemical oxygen demand|COD]]).

Several types of washing equipment are in use:
* Pressure diffusers
* Atmospheric diffusers
* Vacuum drum washers
* Drum displacers
* Wash presses

===Bleaching===
{{Main|Bleaching of wood pulp}}

In a modern mill, brownstock (cellulose fibers containing approximately 5% residual lignin) produced by the pulping is first washed to remove some of the dissolved organic material and then further delignified by a variety of [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleaching]] stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environmentaldefense.org/pdf.cfm?ContentID=1626&amp;FileName=WP5.pdf|format=PDF|title=Environmental Comparison of Bleached Kraft Pulp ManufacturingTechnologies|accessdate=2007-09-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041218171736/http://www.environmentaldefense.org/pdf.cfm?ContentID=1626&amp;FileName=WP5.pdf|archivedate=2004-12-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of a plant designed to produce pulp to make brown sack paper or linerboard for boxes and packaging, the pulp does not always need to be bleached to a high brightness. Bleaching decreases the mass of pulp produced by about 5%, decreases the strength of the fibers and adds to the cost of manufacture.

===Process chemicals===
Process chemicals are added to improve the production process:
* Impregnation aids. [[Surfactant]]s may be used to improve impregnation of the wood chips with the cooking liquors.
* [[Anthraquinone]] is used as a digester additive. It works as a [[redox]] [[catalyst]] by oxidizing [[cellulose]] and reducing [[lignin]]. This protects the cellulose from degradation and makes the lignin more water-soluble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goyal|first=Gopal C. |authorlink= |title=Anthraquinone Pulping. A TAPPI Press Anthology of Published Papers, 1977-1996 |year=1997 |publisher=TAPPI Press |location=Atlanta |isbn=0-89852-340-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An [[flocculant|emulsion breaker]] can be added in the soap separation to speed up and improve the separation of soap from the used cooking liquors by flocculation.&lt;ref&gt;http://wcm.paprican.ca/wcmpaprican/publishing.nsf/AttachmentsByTitle/BO_Tall_Oil_Soap_PDF_Eng/$FILE/0225-E-TallOilSoapRecovery.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Defoamer]]s remove foam and speed up the production process. Drainage of washing equipment is improved and gives cleaner pulp.
* [[Dispersing agent]]s, [[detackifier]]s and [[complexing agent]]s keep the system cleaner and reduce the need for maintenance stops.
* [[Fixation agent]]s are fixating finely [[disperse]]d potential deposits to the fibers and thereby transporting it out of the process.

==Comparison with other pulping processes==
Pulp produced by the kraft process is stronger than that made by other [[wood pulp#Manufacture of wood pulp|pulping processes]] and maintaining a high effective sulfur ratio or sulfidity is important for the highest possible strength. Acidic [[sulfite process]]es degrade cellulose more than the kraft process, which leads to weaker fibers. Kraft pulping removes most of the lignin present originally in the wood whereas mechanical pulping processes leave most of the lignin in the fibers. The [[hydrophobic]] nature of lignin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hubbe |first=Martin a. |authorlink=|author2=Lucian A. Lucia  |year=2007 |title=The "Love-Hate" Relationship Present in Lignocellulosic Materials |journal=BioResources |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=534–535 |id= |url=http://ojs.cnr.ncsu.edu/index.php/BioRes/article/view/BioRes_2_4_534_535_Hubbe_Lucia_Love_and_Hate_Lignocellulosics |accessdate= 2015-02-03 |quote=|format= }}&lt;/ref&gt; interferes with the formation of the [[hydrogen bonds]] between cellulose (and hemicellulose) in the fibers needed for the strength of paper&lt;ref name="bier"/&gt; (strength refers to [[tensile strength]] and resistance to tearing).

Kraft pulp is darker than other wood pulps, but it can be bleached to make very white pulp. Fully bleached kraft pulp is used to make high quality paper where strength, whiteness and resistance to yellowing are important.

The kraft process can use a wider range of fiber sources than most other pulping processes. All types of wood, including very resinous types like southern [[pine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/usda/amwood/256spine.pdf |format=PDF|title=The Southern Pines |accessdate=2007-09-13 |author= |year=1985 |work= |publisher=US Department of Agriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt; and non-wood species like [[bamboo]] and [[kenaf]] can be used in the kraft process.

==Byproducts and emissions==

The main byproducts of kraft pulping are crude sulfate [[turpentine]] and [[tall oil]] soap. The availability of these is strongly dependent on wood species, growth conditions, storage time of logs and chips, and the mill's process.&lt;ref name="woodchem"&gt;{{cite book |last1=|first1= |authorlink1= |editor1-first= Per |editor1-last= Stenius |editor1-link= |others= |title= Forest Products Chemistry |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume= 3|year= 2000 |origyear= |publisher= Fapet OY |location= Helsinki, Finland |isbn= 952-5216-03-9 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= 73–76|chapter= 2 |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pine]]s are the most extractive rich woods. The raw turpentine is [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] and is distilled off the digester, while the raw [[soap]] is separated from the spent [[black liquor]] by [[decantation]] of the soap layer formed on top of the liquor storage tanks. From pines the average yield of turpentine is 5–10&amp;nbsp;kg/t pulp and of crude tall oil is 30–50&amp;nbsp;kg/t pulp.&lt;ref name="woodchem" /&gt;

Various byproducts containing [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[methyl mercaptan]], [[dimethyl sulfide]], [[dimethyl disulfide]], and other volatile [[sulfur]] compounds are the cause of the malodorous air emissions characteristic for [[pulp mill]]s utilizing the kraft process.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, E., Guernsey, J. R., Walker, T. R., Kim, J. S., Sherren, K., &amp; Andreou, P. (2017). Pilot study investigating ambient air toxics emissions near a Canadian kraft pulp and paper facility in Pictou County, Nova Scotia. Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 24(25), 20685-20698.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the modern mills the odor is perceivable only during disturbance situations, for example when shutting the mill down for maintenance break. This is due to collection and burning of these odorous gases in the recovery boiler along with black liquor. The [[sulfur dioxide]] emissions of the kraft pulp mills are much lower than sulfur dioxide emissions from sulfite mills. In modern mills where high dry solids are burned in the recovery boiler hardly any [[sulfur dioxide]] leaves the boiler. This is mainly due to higher lower furnace temperature which leads to higher sodium release from the black liquor droplets that can react with sulfur dioxide forming [[sodium sulfate]].

Pulp mills are almost always located near large bodies of water due to their substantial demand for water. Delignification of chemical pulps releases considerable amounts of organic material into the environment, particularly into rivers or lakes. The wastewater effluent can also be a major source of pollution, containing lignins from the trees, high [[biochemical oxygen demand|biological oxygen demand]] (BOD) and [[dissolved organic carbon]] (DOC), along with [[alcohol]]s, [[chlorate]]s, heavy metals, and [[Chelation|chelating]] agents. The process effluents can be treated in a biological [[Industrial wastewater treatment|effluent treatment plant]], which can substantially reduce their toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, E., Bernier, M., Blotnicky, B., Golden, P.

'''Labor history''' or '''labour history''' is a sub-discipline of [[social history]] which specialises on the history of the [[working class]]es and the [[labor movement]]. The central concerns of labor historians include [[industrial relations]] and forms of labor protest (strikes, lock-outs), the rise of [[mass politics]] (especially the rise of [[socialism]]) and the social and cultural history of the [[Proletariat|industrial working classes]]. Labor historians may also concern themselves with issues of gender, race, ethnicity and other factors besides class but chiefly focus on urban or industrial societies which distinguishes it from [[rural history]].

==Working-class movement==
Labor history developed in tandem with the growth of a self-conscious working-class political movement in many Western countries in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Whilst early labor historians were drawn to protest movements such as [[Luddism]] and [[Chartism]], the focus of labor history was often on institutions: chiefly the labor unions and political parties. Exponents of this ''institutional'' approach included [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]]. The work of the Webbs, and other pioneers of the discipline, was marked by optimism about the capacity of the labor movement to effect fundamental social change and a tendency to see its development as a process of steady, inevitable and unstoppable progress. As two contemporary labor historians have noted, early work in the field was "designed to service and celebrate the Labour movement."&lt;ref&gt;Mike Savage and Andrew Miles, ''The Remaking of the British Working Class, 1840-1940,'' Routledge, 1994, p. 1. {{ISBN|0-415-07320-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marxist influence==
{{Further|Historiography of the United Kingdom#Marxist historians}}

In the 1950s to 1970s, labor history was redefined and expanded in focus by a number of historians, amongst whom the most prominent and influential figures were [[E. P. Thompson]] and [[Eric Hobsbawm]]. The motivation came from current left-wing politics in Britain and the United States and reached red-hot intensity. [[Kenneth O. Morgan]], a more traditional liberal historian, explains the dynamic:
:the ferocity of argument owed more to current politics, the unions’ [[winter of discontent]] [in 1979], and rise of a hard-left militant tendency within the world of academic history as well as within the [[History of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The new history was often strongly Marxist, which fed through the work of brilliant evangelists like [[Raphael Samuel]] into the [[New Left Review]], a famous journal like [[Past &amp; Present (journal)|Past and Present]], the Society of Labour History and the work of a large number of younger scholars engaged in the field. Non-scholars like [[Tony Benn]] joined in. The new influence of Marxism upon Labour studies came to affect the study of history as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth O. Morgan, ''My Histories'' (University of Wales Press, 2015) p 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan sees benefits: 
:In many ways, this was highly beneficial: it encouraged the study of the dynamics of social history rather than a narrow formal institutional view of labour and the history of the Labour Party; it sought to place the experience of working people within a wider technical and ideological context; it encouraged a more adventurous range of sources, [[People's history|‘history from below’ so-called,]] and rescued them from what Thompson memorably called the ‘condescension of posterity’; it brought the idea of class centre-stage in the treatment of working-class history, where I had always felt it belonged; it shed new light on the poor and dispossessed for whom the source materials were far more scrappy than those for the bourgeoisie, and made original use of popular evidence like oral history, not much used before.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''My Histories'' (2015) p 86.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Morgan tells of the downside as well:
: But the Marxist – or sometimes Trotskyist – emphasis in Labour studies was too often doctrinaire and intolerant of non-Marxist dissent–it was also too often plain wrong, distorting the evidence within a narrow doctrinaire framework. I felt it incumbent upon me to help rescue it. But this was not always fun. I recall addressing a history meeting in Cardiff...when, for the only time in my life, I was subjected to an incoherent series of attacks of a highly personal kind, playing the man not the ball, focusing on my accent, my being at Oxford and the supposedly reactionary tendencies of my empiricist colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''My Histories'' (2015) p 86. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/j.ctt17w8h53.9.pdf?_=1467168515247 online at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson and Hobsbawm were Marxists who were critical of the existing labour movement in Britain. They were concerned to approach history "from below" and to explore the agency and activity of working people at the workplace, in protest movements and in social and cultural activities. Thompson's seminal study ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]''&lt;ref&gt;E.P. Thompson, ''The Making of the English Working Class,'' Victor Gollancz Ltd., 1963. {{ISBN|0-14-013603-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; was particularly influential in setting a new agenda for labor historians and locating the importance of the study of labor for [[social history]] in general. Also in the 1950s and 1960s, historians began to give serious attention to groups who had previously been largely neglected, such as women and non-caucasian ethnic groups. Some historians situated their studies of gender and race within a class analysis: for example, [[C. L. R. James]], a [[Marxism|Marxist]] who wrote about the struggles of blacks in the [[Haitian Revolution]]. Others questioned whether class was a more important social category than gender or race and pointed to racism, patriarchy and other examples of division and oppression ''within'' the working class.

Labor history remains centered on two fundamental sets of interest: institutional histories of workers' organizations, and the "history from below" approach of the Marxist historians.

Despite the influence of the Marxists, many labor historians rejected the revolutionary implications implicit in the work of Thompson, Hobsbawm et al. In the 1980s, the importance of [[social class|class]] itself, as an historical social relationship and explanatory concept, began to be widely challenged. Some notable labor historians turned from Marxism to embrace a [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] approach, emphasizing the importance of language and questioning whether classes could be so considered if they did not use a "language of class". Other historians emphasized the weaknesses and moderation of the historic labor movement, arguing that social development had been characterized more by accommodation, acceptance of the social order and cross-class collaboration than by conflict and dramatic change.

==United States==
{{Main article|Labor history of the United States}}
Labor history in the United States is primarily based in history departments, with occasional representation inside labor unions. The scholarship  deals with the institutional history of labor unions and the social history of workers. In recent years there's been special attention to historically marginal groups, especially blacks, women, Hispanics and Asians.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Walkowitz and Donna T. Haverty-Stacke, eds. ''Rethinking U.S. Labor History: Essays on the Working-Class Experience, 1756-2009'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
The Study Group on International Labor and Working-Class History was established: 1971 and has a membership of 1000.  It publishes ''International Labor and Working-Class History''.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.newschool.edu/gf/history/ilwch/ Study Group on International Labor and Working-Class History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518111017/http://www.newschool.edu/gf/history/ilwch/ |date=2015-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; H-LABOR is a daily email-based discussion group formed in 1993 that reaches over a thousand scholars and advanced students.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.h-net.org/~labor/ H-LABOR website]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Labor and Working-Class History Association]] formed in 1988 and publishes ''[[Labor: Studies in Working-Class History of the Americas]]''.

==Historiography==
Kirk (2010) surveys labor historiography in Britain since the formation of the Society for the Study of Labour History in 1960. He reports that labor history has been mostly pragmatic, eclectic and empirical; it has played an important role in historiographical debates, such as those revolving around history from below, institutionalism versus the social history of labor, class, populism, gender, language, postmodernism and the turn to politics. Kirk rejects suggestions that the field is declining, and stresses its innovation, modification and renewal. Kirk also detects a move into conservative insularity and academicism. He recommends a more extensive and critical engagement with the kinds of comparative, transnational and global concerns increasingly popular among labor historians elsewhere, and calls for a revival of public and political interest in the topics.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Kirk, "Challenge, Crisis, and Renewal? Themes in the Labour History of Britain, 1960–2010," ''Labour History Review,'' Aug 2010, Vol. 75 Issue 2, pp 162-180&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Navickas, (2011) examines recent scholarship including the histories of collective action, environment and human ecology, and gender issues, with a focus on work by James Epstein, Malcolm Chase, and Peter Jones.&lt;ref&gt;Katrina Navickas, "What happened to class? New histories of labour and collective action in Britain," ''Social History,'' May 2011, Vol. 36 Issue 2, pp 192-204&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the Marxist orbit, social historians paid a good deal of attention to labour history as well.&lt;ref&gt;John McIlroy, "Asa Briggs and the Emergence of Labour History in Post-War Britain." ''Labour History Review'' 77.2 (2012): 211-242.&lt;/ref&gt;

Addison notes that in Britain by the 1990s, labour history was, "in sharp decline," because:
:there was no longer much interest in history of the white, male working-class.  Instead the 'cultural turn' encouraged historians to explore wartime constructions of gender, race, citizenship and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Addison and Harriet Jones, eds. '' A Companion to Contemporary Britain: 1939-2000'' (2005) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Military-Industrial Commission of the Russian Federation''' (Russian Военно-промышленная комиссия Российской Федерации (acronym VPK)) was established by a [[Decree of the President of Russia|presidential decree]] in March 2006. According to the decree, it is a permanently functioning body with vast responsibilities for supervising the distribution and implementation of the "State defense order". The commission answers directly to the [[President of Russia]]. It coordinates between the [[Defence Ministry of the Russian Federation]], the [[Armed Forces of the Russian Federation]], and the [[Defense industry of Russia|defense industry of Russia]]. Until then, the defense industry was supervised by Russia's [[Ministry of Energy (Russia)|Ministry of Industry and Energy]], as well as by the previous government consultative body with a similar name.

The VPK of the Russian Federation shares the name of the former [[Military-Industrial Commission of the USSR|Soviet Military Industrial Commission]], which served as a central management body for the Soviet defense industry. The VPK was an inner circle of the [[Council of Ministers of the USSR|Council of Ministers]], and the first deputy chairman of the Council headed it. The Soviet VPK's primary function was to facilitate plan fulfilment by easing bottlenecks, enforcing inter-ministerial cooperation, and overseeing the availability of resources.&lt;ref&gt;William E.

'''''Mugsy's Revenge''''' is a strategy and management [[computer game]] for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC that was released in 1986.  It is effectively a sequel to the earlier '[[Mugsy (video game)|Mugsy]]' by the same publisher, and has many of the same features, in both design, and setting.

== Gameplay ==

The player takes the role of 'Mugsy', a gangster who has just been released from prison.  The game begins in 1919, and the aim of the game is for Mugsy to make a fortune from the [[rum-running|bootleg]] smuggling business, which has been generated as a result of [[prohibition]].  In each 'turn' of the game, which represents one year, decisions must be made about how much illegal alcohol to buy, which staff to assign to which activity, and how much money to spend on bribing law enforcement.  Surviving for ten years means that the game ends, with the repeal of prohibition.

The game had a similar theme and visual style to 'Mugsy', in that it featured strong, colorful graphics in a similar style to [[comic books]], with information presented to the player in the form of dialogue between on-screen characters, such as Mugsy himself, and an un-named assistant.  At each decision point, the player enters text into a dialogue box.

There was also a [[mini-game]] arcade element.  This is triggered in the event that one of Mugsy's rivals orders a [[contract killing]] on him.  When this happens, the player controls Mugsy directly, and must shoot the assassins who are sent after him before he being shot too many times himself.

==Controls==

Only a keyboard could be used for the majority of the gameplay, since most of the user input was by text.  A joystick could be used for the arcade sequence. 

==Release==

The game was released at a price of £8.95 for the Commodore and Amstrad versions, and £7.95 for the Spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/games-adverts/m/MugsysRevenge.jpg|accessdate=25 June 2015|title=Mugsy's Revenge Advertisement|publisher=Melbourne House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

Reviews of the Spectrum edition were generally warm, and many compared it unfavourably to the original Mugsy.  While many reviews were positive about the graphics, gameplay was seen as repetitive.  Scores out of ten from magazines were 7 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/mugsysrevenge.htm|title=Mugsy's Revenge|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ([[Your Sinclair]]) 6 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zxspectrumreviews.co.uk/review.aspx?gid=3740&amp;rid=6142|title=Sinclair ZX Spectrum Reviews|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]) and 8 from [[Sinclair User]].

The Commodore reviews were less positive, ranging from 2 out of 10 from [[Your Commodore]], to 6 out of 10 in [[Computer and Video Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemon64.com/games/details.php%3FID%3D1747|title=Lemon - Commodore 64, C64 Games, Reviews &amp; Music!|work=Lemon64|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nova''' (formerly '''Nova Group''') is a large  [[eikaiwa school]] (private [[English (language)|English]] [[language education|teaching company]]) in Japan. It was by far the largest&lt;ref name=mktshare&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; company of this type until its widely publicized collapse in October 2007. Before its [[bankruptcy]], Nova employed approximately 15,000 people across a group of companies that supported the operations of and extended out from the "Intercultural Network" of its language schools. The scope of its business operations reached its peak in February 2007 following a rapid expansion of its chain to 924 Nova branches plus a Multimedia Center located in [[Osaka]].

&lt;/ref&gt; The impending financial crisis facing Nova related to a rapid increase in refund claims, significant drops in sales figures, and deterioration of its reputation, came to the fore in September 2007 when Nova began to delay payment of wages and [[Performance-related pay|bonuses]] to staff. The [[National Union of General Workers|NAMBU Foreign Workers Caucus]] in Tokyo estimated that up to 3,000 staff had not received their salaries on time.  A solution for Nova's failure to pay wages was promised by 19 October in a fax sent to branch schools. On 23 October the Osaka Labor Standards office accepted a demand by [[Trade union|unionized]] Nova instructors to investigate criminal charges against Nova President and founder, [[Nozomu Sahashi]], over delayed and unpaid [[wage]]s, but Sahashi was ultimately not charged.

It took roughly eight months for the company to reach the point where it filed for bankruptcy protection on 26 October 2007 whereupon the trading of its stock was suspended and was delisted on 27 November 2007. On 6 November 2007 court-appointed receivers announced that [[Nagoya]]-based [[G.Communication]] would sponsor Nova.  Initial plans by G.com were to start with reopening up to 30 schools in various locations including Tokyo and Osaka by the end of November 2007. G.com later sold off its 490 Nova and 167 GEOS English schools on 1 October 2010 to Inayoshi Holdings, with 50 of the GEOS schools slated to join the Nova group under the name "Nova x Geos"&lt;ref&gt;Retooled English school chains set to launch Nova x Geos brand http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/business/T101014003658.htm Retrieved 16 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; on 1 November 2010.

&lt;/ref&gt;
Each year, Nova hired between 2,500 and 2,600 foreign teachers to replace those who had left.&lt;ref name=NovaSite&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Although instructors were not required to have actual educational training, the company provided a salary bonus for teachers with an accredited [[TEFL]] certificate, any master's degree, or a degree in education. Teachers were admitted directly after university graduation with any degree that allowed them to obtain a work visa. Instructors from participating countries&lt;ref name=MOFA&gt;

Sahashi originally established the company with two high school graduates from Sweden and Canada whom he met via a friend who was studying abroad in Paris. They opened the first classroom in Shinsaibashi, Osaka. The name ''[[Nova]]'' (an astronomical term for a stellar explosion) was chosen by Sahashi as he felt it would appeal to prospective students.&lt;ref name=slippingsales&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 1996, Nova's [[initial public offering]]&lt;ref name="corpprofile"/&gt; was met with several demonstrations in front of [[Nomura Securities]] and the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]]. A complaint filed by The [[National Union of General Workers|Nova Union]] stated that the company was violating Japanese exchange laws by falsely stating that there were no unions at Nova, nor pending litigation, and that labor relations between the company and its employees were amicable and untroubled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novaunion.com/zet/UB8.html Media Critical of Nova in Wake of Public Stock Offering]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novaunion.com/zet/M6.html "Union, management speak two tongues"] The Japan Times (31 January 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novaunion.com/zet/M4.html "Nova is accused of lying in stock-listing prospectus"] The Japan Times, 19 December 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1997, Nova steadily expanded the number of its schools as its business grew, going from 239 schools to 623 in 2004.&lt;ref name="corpprofile"/&gt; By 2002, Nova had captured 50% of total market share by revenue (61.5 billion yen) and in 2003, Nova had gained a 66% market share by number of students, some 410,000 students in total. However 2005 saw Nova lose ground in total sales revenue.&lt;ref name=newsales&gt;

===Events after the collapse===
The announcement of court protection and the admission that operations at all Nova branches would be temporarily shut down shocked the estimated 420,000 Nova students as some of them had paid their tuition in advance and feared their money might not be refunded. The [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]] asked the [[Japan Association for the Promotion of Foreign Language Education]], an industry body, to call on its member schools to accept Nova students. METI also requested consumer credit companies not to seek loan repayments from the 20% of Nova students who paid their tuition with loans because Nova has ceased operations and they could not take lessons.&lt;ref name=kyodo11&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Nova President [[Nozomu Sahashi]], missing since before his dismissal, was officially replaced by three board members, including co-founder [[Anders Lundqvist]]. The Osaka Labor Bureau, a local branch of the [[Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare]], launched a consulting counter with five interpreters for foreign Nova instructors.&lt;ref name=desperate&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate effect of collapse of Nova was the sudden unemployment of approximately 4,500 foreign teaching staff and 2,000 Japanese workers. The desperate situation of many of the foreign teachers raised concerns over an apparent lack of an adequate safety net for foreign workers in Japan. Some teachers could not even afford a plane ticket home.&lt;ref name=desperate&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The collapse led to huge increases in union membership, particularly in [[National Union of General Workers|NUGW Tokyo Nambu]] (future Tozen Union) and in Osaka's [[General Union]].  The unions had a chance to appeal their case to the public thanks to extensive coverage on TV, radio and newspaper.
The unexpected influx of ex-Nova teachers on the job market led to immense numbers of applicants vying for a much smaller number of employment opportunities. Language education companies, even some outside Japan, attempted to tap into this labor force.&lt;ref name=vulch&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The publicity, generated by the collapse in Japan and in other countries, also threatened to damage the reputation of Japan's foreign language industry although the Japanese government attempted to minimize the damage by pledging non-specific support despite remaining essentially uninvolved in the chaotic collapse. The government did set up a special consultation booth briefly at the [[Hello Work]] public employment office in Shinjuku in Tokyo for Nova instructors seeking advice&lt;ref name=stranded/&gt; but maintained its distance as its position was that the bankruptcy of Japan's biggest foreign language school chain was a private sector matter.&lt;ref name=kyodo11/&gt;

Although Nova was unable to successfully attract a corporate partner to stave off the bankruptcy, twelve companies quickly applied for sponsorship to rebuild Nova Corp, some of which made specific proposals to turn around the company.&lt;ref name=vulch2&gt;

On 7 November 2007, [[G.Communication]], a Nagoya-based operator of cram schools, language schools and restaurant chains announced it had been unofficially selected to take over part of the operations of failed Nova Corp before any official decision by the board of trustees had been released. G.Education Co, a subsidiary of G.communication, would take over part of Nova's operations in addition to the  chain of [[EC Inc]] English conversation schools of Hokkaido it runs. Nova Corp assets not absorbed by G.communication would be liquidated by court appointed administrators. The administrators claimed they had to select a sponsor quickly even before the court approved Nova's reconstruction program as value of Nova corporate assets were eroding each day as employees and students left.&lt;ref name=restructure2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial plans by G.communication were to start with reopening the Nova Kurokawa school in Nagoya's Kita Ward with the intention to reopen up to 30 schools in various locations including Tokyo &amp; Osaka by the end of November 2007. G.communication held several briefing sessions for Nova employees and foreign teachers about their reemployment. Although many of the foreign teachers were not subsequently re-employed, G.communication has opened 465 schools as of January 2010.&lt;ref name=restructure1&gt;

G.communication Co. sold off the Nova and Geos chains of English schools on 1 October 2010.  An investment company led by Masaki Inayoshi, who formerly served as chairman of G.communication, purchased the subsidiary of the Nagoya-based firm that ran both GEOS and Nova.&lt;ref&gt;Geos, Nova English schools change ownership once again http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/business/T101005004522.htm Retrieved 16 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of sale, Nova had 490 locations and Geos 167.

Nova changed ownership again in 2012, being purchased by Jibun Mirai Associe Co. Ltd. However G.communication continues to operate some Nova schools through its subsidiaries G.networks and G.taste, under license from Jibun Mirai Associe.&lt;ref name="Jibun Mirai website"/&gt;

Many Nova branches were (and still are) located near [[train station]]s, and the company used the term ''ekimae ryūgaku'' ("study abroad near the train station": 駅前留学) in its promotional materials. The catch phrase helped Nova to become the nation's biggest chain of English language schools.&lt;ref name="zeal"&gt;{{cite web

Nova's success was also attributed to its promises of a foreign teacher, smaller class sizes than its rivals, and an appointment system that allowed students to schedule and attend class at their convenience.&lt;ref name="disappear"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1997, 18 students filed a [[grievance]] with the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government]] claiming they were unable to make lesson appointments when they wanted, despite the school's advertisements that its students could reserve classes "at any time". The students said they had purchased hundreds of tickets when joining the school, but found it impossible to use them all by the expiry date due to inflexible scheduling procedures. Nova agreed to a proposal by the Damage Relief Committee to repay a total of 3.8 million yen
and said the dispute had been the result of a misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novaunion.com/zet/M9.html "Nova to refund 3.8 million yen for students' unused lessons"] The Japan Times 13 June 1997. Reprinted with permission by Nova Union. Retrieved on 11 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug testing===
In 1994, after two instructors were arrested on drug charges in August and September, Nova asked all 3,100 instructors to sign an agreement to have a mandatory drug test, the results of which would be reported to the police. The drug test only applied to foreign staff.&lt;ref name="seeklegal"&gt;{{cite web

===Shakai hoken===
In March 2005, after NUGW Tokyo Nambu and the [[National Union of General Workers|General Union]] filed a complaint, Nova and other English schools in Japan were investigated by the [[Social Insurance Agency]] for not enrolling employees in {{nihongo |Social Insurance|[[:ja:社会保険|社会保険]],| Shakai Hoken }}. The law stipulates that companies with full-time workers who have been in Japan for more than two months must enroll them in the system. Payment is split between employer and employee, each paying about half the monthly premium amount.&lt;ref name="japantimesprobe"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005, Nova amended its working times for instructors and standardized lesson length to 40 minutes, with two minutes either side for lesson planning and student evaluation, resulting in a total lesson time of 44 minutes. Six to eleven minutes of unpaid time was left between classes. As a result of changes to working hours, regular non-titled teachers whose work weeks were reduced to slightly under 30 hours became ineligible for ''shakai hoken'', giving an estimated savings to the company of over one billion yen in annual premium payments. Such employees can register for [[National Health Insurance (Japan)|National Health Insurance]] (a different system to Shakai Hoken), although this system does not offer coverage for time taken off work due to illness. Nova also offered its own private insurance program.&lt;ref name=Japantimeshealth/&gt;

=== Anti-fraternization policy ===
After six employees were fired for violating a clause in their contracts that forbade interaction between students and instructors outside the classroom, a complaint was filed with the [[Attorney at law (Japan)|Osaka Bar Association]] by two employees who were members of the General Union, one of whom had been dismissed as a result of the policy. The two instructors claimed the policy violated their human rights and argued it was racial discrimination since it only applied to foreigners. The clause in Nova's labor contract stated that foreign teachers "should not have a relationship with customers outside the workplace."&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/member/member.html?nn20030301b8.htm Nova's ban on dating violates rights: teachers] The Japan Times (1 March 2003) retrieved 1 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The Osaka Bar Association subsequently issued a non-binding recommendation that the company drop the clause, saying that it restricted instructors' freedom of association and discriminated between foreign and Japanese staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20040226b4.html Nova, let teachers date students: bar] The Japan Times (26 February 2004).

=== Contested dismissals ===
In November 2004, union supporters gathered outside Nova's Shinjuku Honko school, protesting dismissals of five teachers, three of whom had been working at Nova for more than 10 years. All were members of the Nova union (a branch of the [[National Union of General Workers|NUGW]]). The union alleged they were dismissed due to their union activities.&lt;ref name=Classaction&gt;

Under Nova's system, students bought points in advance to pay for their lessons. The larger number of points they bought, the smaller the individual class fee became. The case taken to the top court involved a former student who had purchased 600 points at a rate of 1,200 yen per lesson. The student canceled the contract after using 386 points, Nova offered a refund based on a calculation that 300 points were bought, resulting in a price of 1,750 yen per lesson.&lt;ref name=asahildp&gt;[http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200706120415.html LDP lawmaker vouched for Nova] The Asahi Shimbun 13 June 2007.

The ''Asahi Shimbun'' cites an example of a contract for 100 lessons, which would cost 230,000 yen in advance, for a per-lesson fee of 2,300 yen. A contract for 600 lessons would require an advance payment of 720,000 yen, or 1,200 yen per class. But if a person with a contract for 600 lessons canceled after taking only 100 classes, Nova would apply the fee of 2,300 yen per lesson, and the student would receive a refund of 490,000 yen. Such students say the contract for 1,200 yen per lesson should have applied in these cases, which would result in a refund of 600,000 yen.&lt;ref name=asahicontract/&gt;

On 13 June 2007, LDP Lower House member [[Yasuhide Nakayama]] acknowledged he was accompanied by Sahashi and vouched for the company during a meeting  with Osaka Mayor Junichi Seki on the morning of 22 May 2006, during the court dispute over the company's refund system. Nakayama, who was elected from an Osaka constituency (of which Sahashi was a member of the lawmaker's support organization) recalled saying at the time that it was "not right by social norms that Nova's refund rule is unacceptable" and explained "it is a politician's job to help out when a supporter is in trouble." Nakayama stated it was not his intention to exert pressure and Mayor Seki said he did not think the judgment of city officials was swayed by the lawmaker's visit.&lt;ref name=asahildp/&gt;

Industry minister [[Akira Amari]] also admitted on 22 June 2007 that he met with Yasuhide Nakayama earlier that year in February shortly after his ministry began investigating the school. Nakayama sought a meeting with Amari to express concern that the ministry might discipline the school over its fee discount system. Amari stated that Nakayama did not try to sway him from punitive action.&lt;ref name=amari&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The six months suspension order did not affect those who had already signed up for lessons, meaning that Nova's students were able to continue taking classes.&lt;ref name=barred/&gt;

The ministry also said that Nova failed to comply with a "cooling-off" system provided for in the specified commercial transaction law. Under this system, consumers can cancel a contract without conditions if the cancellation is made within eight days from when the contract was signed. At Nova, potential students first registered their name, address and other data before finalizing their contracts. An official application to the school was made several days later, after the details of the contract are decided upon. Nova told students who wanted to quit that they could not use the cooling-off system, claiming that the day students registered their data was the first day of the contract.&lt;ref name=asahiministry/&gt;

On 15 June 2007, the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare]] said that Nova's English language courses would no longer qualify for government subsidies for those engaged in educational training authorized by the welfare ministry to improve the abilities of the unemployed and other people. In 1999, Nova's 32 courses were approved for the subsidies program. In fiscal 2006, about 4,700 people received a total of 560 million yen in subsidies under the program. Since 1999, around 71,000 Nova students received a total of about 16.1 billion yen in such subsidies.&lt;ref name=jtshares&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5Q0Q2xKsk?url=http://www.japantoday.com/jp/news/409644 Nova eyes new share issuance to dispel market concerns after gov't terminates subsidies] Kyodo News via Japan Today (16 June 2007) Retrieved on 16 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Nova submitted a business improvement plan to the Tokyo government in late June 2007 as required by the [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry|METI]] conditions. Originally instructed to submit the plan on 10 June, Nova postponed the submission until 24 June.&lt;ref name=postpone6&gt;

By 20 October there had been both union organized and wildcat strikes over the unpaid wages. The numerous delays of wages also led individual teachers also to boycott classes.&lt;ref name=strikes&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 October, the Osaka Labor Standards office accepted a demand by Nova instructors to investigate criminal charges against Sahashi over delayed and unpaid wages.&lt;ref name="Labor Standards-Oct23-Criminal_charges_sought"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/national/news/20071023p2a00m0na003000c.html |title=Labor standards office questions Nova staff |accessdate=24 October 2007 |publisher=Mainichi Daily News |date=24 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023182348/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/national/news/20071023p2a00m0na003000c.html |archivedate=23 October 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of the employment fallout after the collapse was the experience of small private school in Higashinari Ward of Osaka, which said 400 people applied in October for a single job opening. The collapse caught some former teachers in such dire financial straits that they had to rely on their former students to feed them.&lt;ref name=fallout&gt;

===Sahashi's removal===
On 26 October 2007, Nova's stock was delisted and all branches closed, following an emergency board meeting that removed Sahashi from his position as head of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In June 2008, after a volunteer questioning with Osaka Prefectural Police, a warrant was served and Sahashi was arrested on charges of [[embezzlement]]. Sahashi denied charges of wrongdoing and insisted that the 320 million yen reserve fund personally created through a firm affiliated with Nova effectively under Sahashi's control had been set up to refund tuition fees to students who had canceled their lessons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Former Nova chief arrested – Sahashi grilled over misuse of ¥320 million in worker benefits | publisher = The Japan Times| date = 25 June 2008| url = http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20080625a1.html | accessdate =30 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nonpayment of employee housing rent ===
Foreign staff risked losing company-sponsored housing after Nova stopped paying their rent, which they did well before the official announcements of impending bankruptcy. Paul Dorey, an official of the General Union, said: "Some teachers have already received eviction notices. It’s a total mess."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Lawsuits==
The parents of a Nova employee who committed [[suicide]] in 2004 filed a suit against the company on 31 August 2007. Their son, age 28 at the time, was employed by Nova to design and supervise the construction of new classrooms. During that period Nova was engaged in a rapid expansion meant to increase the number of Nova branches by 300 in an attempt to reach a total of 1,000. The parents' suit alleges that their son was required by Nova to work up to 80 hours of overtime in one month, and even through the night on seven occasions, despite his inexperience. At one point he had requested to be relieved but was persuaded to stay, which eventually led to overwhelming stress shortly before his suicide.&lt;ref name=suicide1&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 September 2007, an Osaka woman filed suit against Nova over a refund related issue. Unlike previous complaints about how Nova adjusted the value of unused lesson points on which the Supreme Court ruled in June 2007, this suit contested Nova's decision not to refund lesson points that were extended after the woman purchased additional points.&lt;ref name=HSsuit1&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The woman claims that while Nova explained that her unused points (worth approximately 400,000 yen) from the first contract would carry over after signing a new contract, she was not told that they could not be refunded if she chose to cancel.&lt;ref name=HSsuit2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, approximately a year after the collapse, 24 former students filed a class action lawsuit against accounting firms KPMG AZSA &amp; Co, former Nova president Sahashi, and five of the directors of the company claiming that the rapid expansion was pursued in a reckless manner, and that upfront lesson fees were being misappropriated.&lt;ref name=JT345&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The suit further claims that Sahashi and his directors were negligent in their duties to fulfill obligations to customers. It also accuses five directors and two accounting firms of participating in the bankruptcy of Nova by allowing it to continue to use illicit accounting practices. Those accused allegedly inflated profit reports by recording 45% of the paid-in-advance tuition fees as part of its sales. The suit seeks a total of 16 million yen in compensation.&lt;ref name=asahi778&gt;

Dr. '''Nthato Harrison Motlana''' (16 Feb 1925 – 1 December 2008) was a prominent [[South African]] businessman, physician and anti-apartheid activist.

==Life under Apartheid==
He was tried alongside [[Nelson Mandela]] by the [[Apartheid]] regime during the [[Defiance Campaign]] of 1951–52, and played a prominent role during the [[Soweto uprising]] as one of the members of the [[Soweto Committee of Ten]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southafrica.info/mandela/nthato-motlana.htm ''Mandela mourns Nthato Motlana'' Southafrica.info]&lt;/ref&gt; Motlana was a founding member of the [[Black Community Programme]], a group whose goal was to economically empower black South Africans, and he founded [[Phaphama Africa Commercial Enterprises]], [[Lesedi Clinic]] (the first black owned, private up-market hospital in the country), and [[Sizwe Medical Aid]] (the first black owned medical aid scheme in South Africa). &lt;ref&gt; Coetzee, C &amp; Pienaar, H.

==Life after Apartheid==
Following [[apartheid]], Motlana took a lead role in the formation of the [[New African Investments Limited]], or NAIL, which purchased many previously white run corporations at below market value. These included South Africa's largest newspaper ''[[The Sowetan]]''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sparks|first=Colin|date=2009-05-01|title=South African media in transition|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/jams/2009/00000001/00000002/art00002|journal=Journal of African Media Studies|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=195–220|doi=10.1386/jams.1.2.195_1|issn=2040-199X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his huge success in business Motalana earned the nickname "Father of Black Economic Empowerment." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2809%2960427-X/fulltext, The Lancet, Volume 373, Issue 9665, Page 716, 28 February 2009, Nthato Harrison Motlana]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Playbour''' (sometimes spelled '''playbor''') is a term used to describe a hybrid form of play and labour, specifically in the digital games industry. The term was coined by Julian Kücklich in 2005 in his article ''Precarious playbour: Modders and the digital games industry.'' Kücklich describes playbour as a type of free labour that fits neither traditional definitions of work nor the categories of play or leisure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue5/kucklich_print.html|title=Precarious Playbour: Modders and the Digital Games Industry|last=Kücklich|first=Julian|date=|website=journal.fibreculture.org|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, forms of playbour are often incorrectly perceived as being just an extension of play. Playbour is also sometimes categorized as a part of the [[gamification]] of society in general.

== History ==
While the term playbour itself is a relatively new invention, the phenomena it concerns – those of productive leisure and free labour in the digital games industry – have been around at least since the late 1990s. Kücklich states that since the early 1990s, the relationship between the players of digital games and the digital games industry has changed substantially. He attributes the alteration to the rise of computer [[game modification]], or "modding", as a widespread practice among players.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Modding ===
Creating [[Mod (video gaming)|mods]] for digital games is the perfect example of playbour: a growing number of consumers of digital games are not satisfied with just playing the game, but prefer to enhance their playing experience by creating content for the game themselves. In modding we can see the very essence of playbour, or free labour: while the work of creating a modification can be seen as playful and enjoyable, it is still work. In this respect modding can be fairly similar to another form of collaborative digital production; [[Open-source software|open-source]] software development. The first game to gain a modder base of considerable size is widely agreed to be [[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]] (1993).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sotamaa|first=Olli|date=3 September 2007|title=On modder labour, commodification of play, and mod competitions|url=http://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2006|journal=First Monday|language=en-US|volume=12|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of Doom mods is usually attributed to the fact that the game's code was deliberately designed to facilitate player-created content.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The most famous modder creation is probably [[Counter-Strike]], originally a team-based mod for [[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]] (1998). It later also became the first commercially released mod.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Controversy around playbour and modding ==
Not only is modding a big part of [[Video game culture|gaming culture]], but it is also an increasingly important source of value for the digital games industry. Game companies usually retain the [[Intellectual property|intellectual property rights]] of the modifications. Since players need to have a copy of the original game to run the modifications, mods may add to the shelf-life of the product.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition to that, mods may help with establishing [[brand]]s (e.g. Counter-Strike), thus saving companies a significant amount of money. Marketing costs often take up a large percentage of a game's budget, but successfully established brands require less marketing. Mods also increase customer loyalty and are an important source of innovation in the digital games industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another way that game companies can benefit from the modding culture is that they can recruit modders as employees who are already trained at no cost to the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ephemerajournal.org/contribution/playbour-farming-and-labour|title=Playbour, farming and labour|last=Goggin|first=Joyce|date=|website=www.ephemerajournal.org|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While game companies may benefit economically from playbour, the players doing the work are not entirely uncompensated: they may obtain virtual in-game rewards or social capital such as followers on [[social media]]. The experience of play also has value in itself.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2012/10/15/gamification-playbor-exploitation-2/|title=Gamification, Playbor &amp; Exploitation|last=Patella-Rey|first=PJ|date=16 October 2012|work=The Society Pages|access-date=2018-02-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playbour is a voluntary activity and players don't usually view modding as labour. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that playboures are exploited by the games industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''''Property Report''''' is an [[English language]] [[magazine]] and [[website]] brand started in [[Thailand]] in April 2004 by the company Ensign Media from its offices in [[Bangkok]] and [[Phuket (city)|Phuket]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.property-report.com/site/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226080233/http://www.property-report.com/site/ |archivedate=2011-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The magazine originally launched as ''Asia Property Report'', a bi-monthly 16-page staple bound publication with a newspaper style layout aimed at the real estate industry throughout [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.property-report.com/site/about]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within two issues, the title changed to ''Thailand Property Report'' and the readership focus shifted to investors as the company’s expatriate British founders, Terry Blackburn and Duncan Worthington, sought to capitalize on interest in the booming resort and luxury condominium real estate market in Thailand at the time. The local property market had remained stagnant since the [[Asian Financial Crisis of 1998|Asian financial crisis]] in 1998, but went through a period of unprecedented growth between 2004-2008.  During this time, the magazine grew to be a 126-page, perfect bound publication, became the best selling real estate magazine in the country and expanded its distribution to [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]], to take advantage of local interest in luxury Thai property. Due to local publication licensing laws the magazine was renamed ''Property Report Thailand'' in 2006.

In 2007, Ensign Media opened an office in Singapore in order to launch a sister magazine to ''Property Report Thailand'', ''Property Report Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia''. The publication’s primary areas of focus were Singapore, [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Bali]], [[Penang]] and [[Jakarta]]. Whilst the publisher reported strong subscriber numbers and newsstand sales, the magazine never attracted the same number of advertising pages as ''Property Report Thailand'', meaning its page count was always around 50% of its more established sibling publication. Plans to launch a Singapore Property Awards were announced but then shelved during the [[financial crisis of 2008]].

In June 2010, Ensign merged ''Property Report Thailand'' and ''Property Report Singapore, Malaysia Indonesia'' into a single publication, ''Property Report South East Asia''.  The magazine was distributed in five countries: Singapore, [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], Thailand and Hong Kong with a claimed circulation of 25,000 copies and was [[South East Asia]]’s only monthly [[real estate]] publication.  Its [[editor in chief]] was UK national Andrew Batt, who was previously managing editor of ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.property-report.com/site/editorial-team-6705 Editorial Team] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715123038/http://www.property-report.com/site/editorial-team-6705 |date=2011-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Property Report.com==
In 2005, propertyreport.com was launched under the original magazine branding of Asia Property Report Online and widened the editorial reach of the magazine to cover residential real estate throughout Asia, as well as carrying property and business listings. The website’s most recent redesign was in July 2010, when it scrapped many of its superfluous sections and features to become more opinion, analysis and feature focused, and debuted a new property [[search engine]] and villa rental section.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://property-report.com site/editorial-team-6705|title=Property Report|accessdate=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thailand Property Awards==
In 2006, Ensign held the inaugural Thailand Property Awards, to recognize achievements in residential real estate.  In order to avoid accusations of favoritism towards advertisers, the organizers used a panel of independent judges and monitoring of the process&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnngo.com/bangkok/life/desire-live-dream-keeps-thai-property-market-afloat-917007 CNN Go]&lt;/ref&gt; by auditing firm BDO Advisory&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bdo-thaitax.com/bdo/tpa2010-intro BDO Thai Tax]&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst this occasionally produced controversial results, the awards continued to grow over the years and attracted over 500 attendees to the November 2010 gala dinner and considerable local and international [[News media|media]] coverage for winners&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkokpost.com/business/economics/205272/golden-land-wins-award Bangkok Post]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, Ensign Media announced plans for the South East Asia Property Awards to be held in Singapore in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ensign-media.com/south-east-asia-property-awards.html Ensign Media] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710193619/http://www.ensign-media.com/south-east-asia-property-awards.html |date=2011-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
''Property Report'' is available for sale in major English language bookstores throughout Thailand, including [[Asia Books]], [[Kinokuniya]] and [[Bookazine]]. Complimentary copies can also be found in five star hotels, airport business lounges and at the [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] gate service at [[Suvarnabhumi Airport|Bangkok International Airport]].  Property Report is also available by subscription&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.property-report.com/site/about|title = Property Report|accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raymond Rubicam''' (June 16, 1892 – May 8, 1978) was an American advertising pioneer who co-established the [[Young &amp; Rubicam]] (Y&amp;R) [[advertising agency]] with [[John Orr Young]]. He retired from Y&amp;R in 1944 at age 52.

Raymond Rubicam's innovative leadership and creativity led many to recognize him as "advertising's statesman." Because his creative concepts and innovations have continued to play an important role in advertising as we know it today many people consider him the "father of modern advertising".

==Biography==
As a young copywriter for N.W. Ayer and Son, Rubicam was responsible for some of advertising's most memorable pieces. Steinway's "The Instrument of the Immortals," Squibb's "The Priceless Ingredient," and Rolls-Royce's "No Rolls-Royce has ever worn out," were highly successful slogans which made him one of the industry's leading copywriters. While he enjoyed considerable success at N.W. Ayer, he felt that the agency failed to emphasize the importance of the creative artist in advertising. Rubicam, seeking to create an agency that valued artistic and creative talent over business, joined with James Orr Young to found Young &amp; Rubicam in 1923.

Rubicam's skills and his recruitment of the industry's most talented specialists propelled Young &amp; Rubicam into the forefront of advertising. David Ogilvy credited Rubicam with assembling "the best team of copywriters and art directors in the history of advertising," whose advertisements "were read by more people than any other agency's." The agency represented many of America's leading companies, such as Gulf Oil, General Electric, Johnson and Johnson, Fortune, Life and others.

While Raymond Rubicam's emphasis on creativity was innovative in itself, his philosophy and copywriting approach revolutionized the industry. He believed that an advertisement should "mirror the reader." Knowledge and understanding of the customer was a critical component of effective advertising. With the help of Dr. George Gallup, Rubicam pioneered new methods of consumer and media research. Young &amp; Rubicam was the first agency to use scientific telephone sampling and to test audiences to measure the success of commercials and advertisements. The agency was also one of the first to produce their own programs, often integrating commercials into radio shows. The development of the "sequence-picture copy" was another Rubicam innovation. His was the first agency to use comic strips as a medium for advertising, creating "Mr. Coffee Nerves" for Postum and "Little Alby" for Grape-Nuts.

Under his direction, Young &amp; Rubicam made significant contributions to the war effort during World War II. The agency donated its time and resources to the War Advertising Council, the Treasury Department on War Loan Drives and to the Department of Agriculture for farm labor recruitment campaigns. Independently, Rubicam served as a special assistant to the War Manpower Commission, director of United China Relief, and later as a member of the Committee for Economic Development. The CED worked to support the United States during the war and significantly influenced policy following its conclusion.

Rubicam also occupied several positions in the business world and contributed to the development of his community. He served as the director of the New York Life Insurance Company, Bates Manufacturing and Valley National Bank.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1922">In [[economics]], '''saving-investment balance''' or '''I-S balance''' is a balance of [[national savings]] and national investment, which is equal to [[current account]]. This relationship is obtained from the national income identity.

==Description==
This is the national income identity:&lt;ref&gt;Christiano, 2003, [http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~lchrist/362/w2003/lect1.pdf Rough Notes on National Income Accounting and the Balance of Payments], Northwestern University, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Y=C+I+G+(EX-IM)&lt;/math&gt;
where
*Y: [[GDP]],
*C: national [[consumption (economics)|consumption]],
*I: national investment,
*G: [[government spending]],
*EX: [[export]],
*IM: [[import]],
*EX－IM: current account.

The national income identity can be rewritten as following:&lt;ref name="nothwestern3"&gt;Christiano, 2003, [http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~lchrist/362/w2003/lect1.pdf Rough Notes on National Income Accounting and the Balance of Payments], Northwestern University, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(Y-T-C)+(T-G)-I=EX-IM&lt;/math&gt;
where T is defined as [[tax]]. (Y-T-C) is savings of [[private sector]] and (T-G) is savings of government. Here, we define S as  National savings (= savings of private sector + savings of government) and rewrite the identity as following:
:&lt;math&gt;S-I=EX-IM&lt;/math&gt;
This identity implies that the difference of national savings and national investment is equal to current account.&lt;ref name="nothwestern3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IMF publishment, 2006, [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2006/12/basics.htm Do Current Account Deficits Matter?], accessed 3rd February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tejvan Pettinger, 2012, [http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/6411/economics/current-account-savings-investment/ Current Account = Savings – Investment], EconomicsHelp.org, accessed 3rd February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life==
Tan was born in [[Puchong|Puchong New Village]] in [[Selangor]] on 24 September 1940 to a poor family.&lt;ref name=mca&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mca.org.my/en/about-us/about-mca/history-zone/former-presidents/tan-koon-swan/ |title=Tan Koon Swan |work=Malaysian Chinese Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402152102/http://www.mca.org.my/en/about-us/about-mca/history-zone/former-presidents/tan-koon-swan/ |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped out at his parent's hawker stall while still in school.&lt;ref name=biography&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=v9QEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1082&amp;lpg=PA1082#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Southeast Asian Personalities of Chinese Descent: A Biographical Dictionary |editor= Leo Suryadinata |author=Ho Khai Leong |pages=1081–1083 |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |year= 2012 |isbn=978-9814345217 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied in a missionary school, and after leaving school, he worked as a clerk with [[Tenaga Nasional#Lembaga Letrik Negara (1965-1990)|Lembaga Lektrik Negara]] (LLN) while studying part-time to finish his High School Certificate (HSC). He also worked as a laboratory technician with LLN, then moved on to be an investigator of Inland Revenue Board and a tax consultant with [[Esso]].&lt;ref name=mca /&gt;

Tan married his first wife, Catherine Chong, who is a [[paraplegic]] and they have two children meanwhile he together with his second wife, Penny Chang, have another three daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2009/08/01/duo-show-its-possible-to-overcome-failure/ | title =Duo show it’s possible to overcome failure |author= CHEONG SUK-WAI |work=Singapore ST | publisher = [[The Star (Malaysia)]] |date=1 August 2009| accessdate = 30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tan after much hiccups in life still a respected member of society, is a born-again [[Christian]] who likes to maintain a low profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The Sunday Interview With: Former MCA President Tan Koon Swan | date = 2 October 2005 | newspaper = [[New Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and business career==
In 1970, Tan became the General Manager of Genting Highlands Berhad, helping [[Lim Goh Tong]] to establish [[Genting Highlands Resort]] as a successful tourist destination. In 1976, he attended a senior management course at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name=mca /&gt;

In 1977, he was invited by the then MCA president [[Lee San Choon]] to head the Koperatif Sebaguna Malaysia (KSM) and Multi-Purpose Holdings Berhad (MPHB), the corporate structure through which the MCA hoped to encourage Chinese participation in all areas of economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Portrait of Success | date = 1 December 1985 | newspaper = Malaysian Business | pages = 8, 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the party and became involved in politics.

In [[Malaysian general election, 1978|1978 general election]], Tan made his political debut, winning a parliamentary seat in [[Raub]], Pahang. The following year, he was elected to the party's Central Committee and appointed Chairman of MCA [[Federal Territory (Malaysia)|Wilayah Persekutuan]] State Liaison Committee. In [[Malaysian general election, 1982|1982 general election]], he cinched a landslide victory for the parliamentary seat in the opposition stronghold of [[Damansara, Selangor|Damansara]], Selangor.&lt;ref name="Past Presidents: Tan Koon Swan"&gt;[http://www.mca.org.my/English/PastPresidents/Pages/TanKoonSwan.aspx Past Presidents: Tan Koon Swan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712044805/http://www.mca.org.my/English/PastPresidents/Pages/TanKoonSwan.aspx |date=12 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1984 saw him appointed as vice-president of the MCA.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In March 1984, Tan was sacked as vice-president from the MCA along with [[Lee Kim Sai]] as well as other members for urging the party to investigate its member records for the presence of non-existent people, an issue that had sparked off factionalism and crisis within the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The Malaysian Chinese Association has expelled 14 leading members including vice president, Tan Koon Swan | date = 29 March 1984 | newspaper = [[The Wall Street Journal Asia]] | pages = 1, 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he and the other 13 were all reinstated two months later with the support of 1,600 MCA members in an extraordinary general meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = An EGM of 1,615 "dissident" members of the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) in Kuala Lumpur yesterday (6 May) voted to reinstate the 14 expelled leaders led by Tan Koon Swan | date = 7 May 1984 | newspaper = [[The Wall Street Journal Asia]] | pages = 1, 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1985, he was voted to be president of the MCA winning 76.9% of the votes cast, the largest majority in the party's history, and the first challenger since 1954 to win national leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Mr Tan Koon Swan was yesterday elected president of the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) by a landslide | date = 25 November 1985 | newspaper = [[The Wall Street Journal Asia]] | page = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = MCA: New Beginning | date = 1 December 1985 | newspaper = Malaysian Business | page = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a memoir published by Robert Kuok, it was revealed that the MCA leadership approached Kuok to provide a bail payment for Tan in 1986. The amount paid by Kuok was S$20 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017/12/10/robert-kuoks-memoir-stirs-debate-the-tycoons-tellall-with-its-many-political-insights-and-revelation/|title=Robert Kuok’s memoir stirs debate - Nation {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pan-El crisis===
Tan remained a highly prominent member of the corporate sector, controlling numerous companies, including Sigma International, which had a 22.6% stake in [[Pan-Electric Industries]] (Pan-El),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Prospects Improve For Pan Electric Rescue / Attempts to save debt-ridden Singaporean company | author = Chris Sherwell | date = 25 November 1985 | newspaper = [[Financial Times]] | page = 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Singaporean-based company. Pan-Electric entering receivership forced the closure of the Singapore and Kuala Lumpur stock exchanges between December 2nd and 4th 1985, to try to contain the fallout on leveraged stockbroking firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/ec498103-8fda-4fe1-b85d-0bf4235e6253|title=The Pan-Electric crisis hits the stock market - Singapore History|website=eresources.nlb.gov.sg|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 December 1985, Tan signed an agreement that gave the troubled company [[SGD|S$]] 20 million of funds through an [[interest]]-free loan and allowed it to resume trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Singapore Pact to Aid Troubled Firm | date = 12 December 1985 | newspaper = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | page = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = An interim agreement has been signed by parties concerned to save Pan Electric Industries of Singapore and pave the way for a rescue and reconstruction of the debt-ridden concern | date = 12 December 1985 | newspaper = [[The Wall Street Journal Asia]] | pages = 1, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 he was charged in Singapore with abetting criminal breach of trust relating to the collapse of Pan-El. He was sentenced to two years imprisonment by Singapore High Court Justice [[Lai Kew Chai]]. In Lai's judgement, Lai said Tan's offences had "struck at the very heart, integrity, reputation and confidence of Singapore as a commercial city and financial centre".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/in_memoriam/former_singapore_high_court_judge_lai_kew_chai_dies.html|title=The Malaysian Bar - Former Singapore High Court judge Lai Kew Chai dies|website=www.malaysianbar.org.my|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his sentencing, Tan resigned in 1987 as MCA President&lt;ref name="Past Presidents: Tan Koon Swan"/&gt;  and Member of Parliament for [[Gopeng (federal constituency)|Gopeng]], Perak that he won in [[Malaysian general election, 1986|1986 general election]] earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://malaysiansmustknowthetruth.blogspot.com/2012/09/koon-swan-saga-will-truth-emerge.html | title = Koon Swan saga: Will the truth emerge? | date = 12 September 2012| publisher = Malaysians Must Know the Truth. | accessdate = 7 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 Tan was also sentenced and imprisoned in Malaysia, declared a bankrupt, and reportedly owed over [[Ringgit Malaysia|RM]] 400 million, at the time roughly equivalent to more than 100 million US dollars. He was ordered to pay RM1000 a month to the Official Assignee and the New Straits Times estimated it would take him 35,316 years to pay off his outstanding claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Unknown | date = 4 May 1989 |newspaper = [[New Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1990s, after full repayment, Tan was discharged from bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Tan Koon Swan no longer a bankrupt | date = 20 September 1995 | newspaper = [[New Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a book by the former chief prosecutor [[Glenn Knight]] revealed that Chief Justice [[Yong Pung How]] stated in a 1996 hearing that Tan Koon Swan had been wrongfully charged in the Pan-El case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Glenn |title=Glenn Knight, The Prosecutor|location=Singapore|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Editions|year=2012|isbn=978-981-4302-33-3|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Koon Swan wrongfully jailed | url = http://www.theedgemalaysia.com/highlights/220201-koon-swan-wrongfully-jailed.html | publisher = [[The Edge (Malaysia)]] | accessdate = 11 September 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130203203619/http://www.theedgemalaysia.com/highlights/220201-koon-swan-wrongfully-jailed.html | archivedate = 3 February 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Koon Swan case 'a mistake' | url = http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2012/9/11/nation/12002560&amp;sec=nation | newspaper = [[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] | accessdate = 11 September 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120912010629/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2012%2F9%2F11%2Fnation%2F12002560&amp;sec=nation | archivedate = 12 September 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the book has been heavily criticised as containing factual errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = A-G Chambers: Errors in Glenn Knight's book | url = http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?sec=nation&amp;file=/2012/9/14/nation/20120914222153 | newspaper = [[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] | accessdate = 14 September 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120915032856/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2012%2F9%2F14%2Fnation%2F20120914222153&amp;sec=nation | archivedate = 15 September 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Of pleading guilty and going topless | url = http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2012/9/30/focus/12085322&amp;sec=focus | newspaper = [[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] | accessdate = 30 September 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121022060522/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2012%2F9%2F30%2Ffocus%2F12085322&amp;sec=focus | archivedate = 22 October 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background, early life and education==
De Jong was born in [[Arnhem]], [[The Netherlands]], to her Dutch father and Austrian mother; and the family moved to [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]], Australia, when de Jong was one year-old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dutchaustralian.com/meet-tania-de-jong/|title=Meet Tania de Jong|work=Dutch Australian |author=Veldman-Tentori, Renee|date=20 April 2012|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her grandfather, Karl Duldig, a Polish refugee who escaped the Holocaust, was a Vienna-trained sculptor. Her grandmother, [[Slawa Duldig]] also trained as a sculptor in Vienna and invented the world's first modern folding umbrella.&lt;ref name="SMH2014"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/soprano-on-a-mission-20140313-34o35.html|title=Soprano on a mission|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|author=Evans, Kathy|date=15 March 2014|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their home in Melbourne's {{VICcity|Malvern East}} now operates as a museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duldig.org.au/|title=The Duldig Studio|publisher=|work=|date=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Jong's mother was a Dutch national tennis champion, a [[Fed Cup|Federation Cup]] player for Australia and a quarter-finalist at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]].&lt;ref name="SMH2014"/&gt;

'''''The Law of Success''''' is a 1925 book – actually in the form of a set of 15 separate booklets –  by [[Napoleon Hill]]. It was released as a limited edition of 118 copies and was given to many of Americas most successful individuals, all of whom had contributed to the book's content. One of those copies was used by Orne Publishing to reprint it in 2010.

'''''The Law of Success in 16 Lessons''''' is an edited version of Napoleon Hill’s first manuscripts which was reworked under advisement of some the contributors and first published in 1928. This version was initially published as a multi-volume correspondence course. Later editions consolidated the material into a single hardcover book. The most current version available is through Wilder Publishing.

According to Hill, the work was commissioned at the request of [[Andrew Carnegie]] at the conclusion of a multi-day interview with Hill, and was allegedly based upon interviews of over 100 American millionaires across nearly 20 years, including such self-made industrial giants as [[Henry Ford]], [[J. P. Morgan]], [[John D. Rockefeller]], [[Alexander Graham Bell]], and [[Thomas Edison]]. The Law of Success was first presented as a lecture, and was delivered by its author in practically every major city and in many smaller localities throughout the United States over a period of more than seven years.

The author frequently refers to 'The Temple of Success' and cites the laws and their collective understanding to be the door to the Temple of Success. It is his stance that thought is the most organised form of energy.

The following outline is from the original 1925 edition.

== A Definite Purpose ==

'''Lesson 1''' A Definite Purpose will teach you how to save the wasted effort which the majority of people expend in trying to find their life-work. This lesson will show you how to do away forever with aimlessness and fix your heart and hand upon some definite, well-conceived purpose as a life-work.

== [[Self-confidence|Self-Confidence]] ==

'''Lesson 2'''  Self-Confidence will help you master the six basic fears with which every person is (cursed): the fear of Poverty, the fear of Ill Health, the fear of Old Age, the fear of (Criticism), the fear of Loss of Love of Someone, and the fear of Death. It will teach you the difference between (egotism) and real self-confidence which is based upon definite, usable knowledge.

== [[Initiative (enterprise)|Initiative]] and [[Leadership]] ==

'''Lesson 3.''' Initiative and leadership will show you how to become a leader instead of a follower in your chosen field of endeavor. It will develop in you the instinct for leadership which will cause you gradually to gravitate to the top in all undertakings in which you participate.

== [[Imagination]] ==

'''Lesson 4'''  Imagination will stimulate your mind so that you will conceive new ideas and develop new plans which will help you in attaining the object of your Definite Chief Aim. This lesson will teach you how to "build new homes out of old stones", so to speak. It will show you how to create new ideas out of old, well known concepts, and how to put old ideas to new uses. This one lesson, alone, is the equivalent of a very practical course in salesmanship, and it is sure to prove a veritable gold mine of knowledge to the person who is in earnest.

== Action ==

'''Lesson 5''' Action - As a matter of facts imaginations and purposes cannot yield anything unless action is taken to realize the purpose. Actions prove the practicability of our imaginations. When powered with clear purpose and strong leadership it yields desired results [requires further contribution and reference]

== [[Enthusiasm]] ==

'''Lesson 6'''  Enthusiasm will enable you to "saturate" all with whom you come in contact with interest in you and in your ideas. Enthusiasm is the foundation of a Pleasing Personality, and you must have such a personality in order to influence others to co-operate with you.

== [[Self-control|Self-Control]] ==

'''Lesson 7'''  Self-control is the "balance wheel" with which you control your enthusiasm and direct it where you wish it to carry you. This lesson will teach you, in a most practical manner, to become "the master of your fate, the Captain of your Soul.

== Habit Of Performing More Service Than Paid For ==

'''Lesson 8'''  The Habit Of Performing More Service Than Paid For is one of the most important lessons of the Law of Success course. It will teach you how to take advantage of the Law of Increasing Returns, which will eventually ensure you a return in money far out of proportion to the service you render. No one may become a real leader in any walk of life without practicing the habit of doing more work and better work than that for which he is paid.

== Attractive Personality ==

'''Lesson 9'''  Attractive Personality is the "fulcrum" on which you must place the "crow-bar" of your efforts, and when so placed, with intelligence, it will enable you to remove mountains of obstacles. This one lesson, alone, has made scores of Master Salesmen. It has developed leaders over night. It will teach you how to transform your personality so that you may adapt yourself to any environment, or to any other personality, in such a manner that you may easily dominate.

== Accurate Thought ==

'''Lesson 10''' Accurate Thought is one of the important foundation stones of all enduring success. This lesson teaches you how to separate "facts" from mere "information." It teaches you how to organize known facts into two classes: the "important" and the "unimportant." It teaches you how to determine what is an "important" fact. It teaches you how to build definite working plans, in the pursuit of any calling, out of FACTS. It illustrates how the eyes of an accurate thinker sees only facts and not [[delusion]]s of [[prejudice]], hate and envy. It explains how accurate thought depends on deductive reasoning and creative thought.

== [[Concentration]] ==

'''Lesson 11''' Concentration teaches you how to focus your attention upon one subject at a time until you have found a way to master that subject and have put that knowledge into operation. He gives you techniques on how to ensure that your goal is concentrated on until you have completed that goal.

== [[Toleration|Tolerance]] ==

'''Lesson 12''' Toleration will teach you how to avoid the disastrous effects of racial and religious prejudices which mean defeat for millions of people who permit themselves to become entangled in foolish argument over these subjects, thereby poisoning their own minds and closing the door to reason and investigation. This lesson is the twin sister of the one on ACCURATE THOUGHT, for the reason that no one may become an Accurate Thinker without practicing tolerance. Intolerance closes the book of knowledge and writes on the cover, "Finished, I have learned it all!" Intolerance makes enemies of those who should be friends. It destroys opportunity and fills the mind with doubt, mistrust and prejudice.
