'''Ableism in Canada''' refers to a set of discourses, behaviours and structures which express feelings of anxiety, fear, hostility and antipathy towards [[disabled people]] in [[Canada]]. 

==Overview==
The specific types of discrimination that have occurred or are still occurring in Canada include the ability to access to important facilities such as infrastructure within the transport network, restrictive immigration policies, involuntary sterilization to stop the disabled from having offspring, barriers to employment opportunities, a wage that is high enough to maintain a minimal standard of living, and institutionalization of the disabled in substandard conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Policy on ableism and discrimination based on disability |url=http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-ableism-and-discrimination-based-disability |publisher=Ontario Human Rights Commission |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austerity decisions made by the government of Canada have also at time been referred to as ableist, such as funding cuts that put disabled people at risk of living in abusive arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/austerity-left-people-with-disabilities-without-housing-n-s-inquiry-told|title=‘Ableist’ bias left people with disabilities without housing, N.S. inquiry told|date=4 June 2018|work=National Post|accessdate=26 August 2018|first=Michael|last=Tutton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Strang - Adoration (1913).jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Adoration'', 1913, by [[William Strang]]]]
'''Adoration''' ([[Latin]]) is respect, reverence, strong admiration or devotion in a certain person, place, or thing. The term comes from the Latin ''adōrātiō'', meaning "to give [[Homage (arts)|homage]] or [[worship]] to someone or something".

==Ancient Rome==
In classical Rome, adoration was primarily an act of homage or worship, which, among the Romans, was performed by raising the hand to the mouth, kissing it and then waving it in the direction of the adored object. The devotee had his head covered, and after the act turned himself round from left to right. Sometimes he kissed the feet or knees of the images of the gods themselves, and Saturn and Hercules were adored with the head bare. By a natural transition the homage, at first paid to divine beings alone, came to be paid to monarchs. Thus the Greek and Roman emperors were adored by bowing or kneeling, laying hold of the imperial robe, and presently withdrawing the hand and pressing it to the lips, or by putting the royal robe itself to the lips.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Adoration |volume=1|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Middle East==
In Eastern countries, adoration has been performed in an attitude still more lowly. The [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] method, introduced by [[Cyrus the Great]], was to kiss the knee and fall on the face at the prince's feet, striking the earth with the forehead and kissing the ground. This striking of the earth with the forehead, usually a fixed number of times, was a form of adoration sometimes paid to Eastern potentates.

The Jews kissed in homage, as did other groups mentioned in the Old Testament. Thus in 1&amp;nbsp;Kings 19:18, God is made to say, "Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him." And in Psalms 2:12, "Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way". (See also Hosea 13:2.)&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Western Europe==
In Western Europe, the ceremony of [[Kissing Hands|kissing the sovereign's hand]], and some other acts which are performed while kneeling, may be described as forms of adoration.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Catholic Church==
The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that "Adoration is the acknowledgement of God as God, creator and savior, the Lord and master of everything that exists, as infinite and merciful love."&lt;ref&gt;CCC §2096&lt;/ref&gt; "Adoration is homage of the spirit to the King of glory, respectful silence in the presence of the ever greater God."&lt;ref&gt;CCC §2628&lt;/ref&gt; Adoration is prompted by the Holy Spirit.
 
In the strict sense, adoration is an act of religion offered to God in acknowledgment of His supreme perfection and dominion, and of the creature's dependence upon Him. "The rational creature, looking up to God, whom reason and revelation show to be infinitely perfect, cannot in right and justice maintain an attitude of indifference. That perfection which is infinite in itself and the source and fulfilment of all the good that we possess or shall possess, we must worship, acknowledging its immensity, and submitting to its supremacy."&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01151a.htm Sullivan, William L. "Adoration". The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 20 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In Luke 4:7-8, Jesus tells the tempter, "Scripture has it, 'You shall do homage to the Lord your God, Him alone shall you adore.'" The worship called forth by God, and given exclusively to Him as God, is designated by the Greek name ''latreia'' (Latinized, ''latria''), which is usually translated "Adoration". Adoration differs from other acts of worship, such as supplication, confession of sin, etc., inasmuch as it formally consists in self-abasement before the Infinite, and in devout recognition of His transcendent excellence. The primary and fundamental element in adoration is an interior act of mind and will; the mind perceiving that God's perfection is infinite, the will bidding one to extol and worship this perfection.&lt;ref name=Sullivan/&gt;

Adoration is a willing submission of self to God expressed interiorly as well as exteriorly by one's actions. It is an interior act of mind and will where the mind humbly admits that God's perfection is infinite, and the will moves one us to worship this perfection. An acknowledge of God's right as God to be Lord of one's life and in control of it involves a voluntarily offer of submission. [[Thomas Aquinas]] says: "Adoration is primarily an interior reverence for God expressing itself secondarily in bodily signs of humility: bending our knee (to express our weakness compared to God) and prostrating ourselves (to show that of ourselves we are nothing)."&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas, ''Summa'', 84.2&lt;/ref&gt;  Genuflecting is an outward gesture of an inward attitude of adoration towards God, as is the praying of the [[Pater Noster]]. "The first phrase of the Our Father is a blessing of adoration before it is a supplication. For it is the glory of God that we should recognize Him as "Father", the true God".&lt;ref&gt;CCC §2781&lt;/ref&gt;

Adoration is reflected in the prayer of praise which acknowledges God for who he is in comparison to the prayer of thanksgiving which acknowledges God for what he has done. Rev. Raniero Cantalamesa observed that "the greatest danger with God is for us to become accustomed to him, to fall from awe into routine."&lt;ref&gt;Cantalamesa, Raniero. ''Praise Him'', January 2003, Vol. XXIX, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Adoration also takes the form of [[Eucharistic adoration]]. The Catholic belief in [[transubstantiation]] is that the [[Real Presence|bread and wine]] literally become the body and blood of Jesus Christ, through which Catholics adore Jesus Christ. The [[sacramental bread|host]] is usually placed in a [[monstrance]], and reverently viewed at [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament|Benedictions]] and during adoration. Some churches contain "adoration chapels" in which the [[Eucharist]] is continuously on display that the faithful may observe their faith through it. "The [[John Vianney|Cure of Ars]] would spend hours in front of the Blessed Sacrament. When people would ask him what he would do or say during those hours, he would say: 'He looks at me, and I look at him.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=6558 Grutsch, Paul. "Adoration", Ignatius Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4120">[[File:Mehmed II ferman.jpg|thumb|A transcript kept in the Franciscan monastery in Fojnica]]
The '''Ahdname of Milodraž''' ({{lang-sh|Milodraška ahdnama}}/Милодрашка ахднама), also called the '''Ahdname of Fojnica''' (Фојничка ахднама/''Fojnička ahdnama''), was the ''[[ahdname]]'' issued on 28 May 1463 (or 1464) by the Ottoman sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] to [[Bosnian Franciscans]], represented by [[Anđeo Zvizdović]].

== Tradition and history ==
According to Bosnian Franciscan tradition, Mehmed was preparing to depart following the [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia]] when Anđeo Zvizdović came to meet him in the Ottoman military camp in [[Milodraž]].&lt;ref name="Andrić"/&gt; Led in by Mehmed's soldiers,&lt;ref name="Andrić"/&gt; Zvizdović drew the Sultan's attention to the exodus of Catholics from the newly conquered country.&lt;ref name="Džaja"/&gt; The friar specifically pointed to the necessity of maintaining the merchants, craftsmen and miners, and so succeeded in receiving Mehmed's solemn promise of [[religious tolerance]].&lt;ref name="Džaja"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Džaja|first=Srećko|title=Katoličanstvo u Bosni i Hercegovini od Kulina bana do austro-ugarske okupacije|work=Croatica Christiana Periodica|volume=16|date=30 November 1992|pages=167–168|isbn=|ref=harv|language=Serbo-Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Franciscans of [[Bosna Argentina]] recognized Mehmed as their sovereign, and in return he promised that "the Bosnian priests shall have freedom and protection, and may return to and settle the lands in the Empire in their monasteries without consternation. No-one is to attack them, nor threaten their lives, property or churches."&lt;ref name=Velikonja&gt;{{Cite book|last=Velikonja|first=Mitija|title=Religious Separation and Political Intolerance in Bosnia-Herzegovina|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|year=2003|pages=79|isbn=1603447245|ref=harv|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its form and content, as well as Mehmed's personal oath, resemble that of an [[international treaty]].&lt;ref name="Krleža"/&gt;

The rights expressed in the Ahdname of Milodraž were reiterated by all subsequent [[Ottoman sultans]], but the Franciscans were nevertheless in a difficult position with the local authorities. Although they were loyal to the Ottoman regime, the local government often suspected them of aiding the Catholic [[Habsburg Empire]], the Ottoman Empire's greatest enemy.&lt;ref name=Velikonja/&gt; Bosnian Franciscans used the Ahdname of Milodraž not only in relations with the Muslim authorities, but also to protect themselves from the ambitions of [[Eastern Orthodox]] clergy when the latter claimed the right to collect tax from them too on the basis of an earlier ''[[firman]]''.&lt;ref name="Andrić"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Andrić|first=Ivo|author-link=Ivo Andrić|title=The Development of Spiritual Life in Bosnia under the Influence of Turkish Rule|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1990|pages=42|isbn=0822382555|ref=harv|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ahdname of Milodraž is often said to have enabled the survival of [[Roman Catholicism in Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref name="Krleža"/&gt;

== Historicity ==
The Ahdname of Milodraž has been preserved in transcripts; an ''ahdname'' was likely also issued to the Franciscans of [[Srebrenica]] in 1462, but it has been entirely lost.&lt;ref name="Džaja"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Krleža"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|last=|first=|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/Natuknica.aspx?ID=924|title=Ahdnama|work=Croatian Encyclopaedia|publisher=Miroslav Krleža Institute of Lexicography|year=|isbn=|ref=harv|language=Serbo-Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of the original document led some historians to describe the Ahdname of Milodraž as a forgery. Its historicity was only confirmed in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name="Džaja"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2526">'''Amodal perception''' is the [[perception]] of the whole of a physical structure when only parts of it affect the sensory receptors. For example, a table will be perceived as a complete volumetric structure even if only part of it—the facing surface—projects to the retina; it is perceived as possessing internal volume and hidden rear surfaces despite the fact that only the near surfaces are exposed to view. Similarly, the world around us is perceived as a surrounding plenum, even though only part of it is in view at any time. Another much quoted example is that of the "dog behind a picket fence" in which a long narrow object (the dog) is partially occluded by fence-posts in front of it, but is nevertheless perceived as a single continuous object. Albert Bregman noted an auditory analogue of this phenomenon: when a melody is interrupted by bursts of white noise, it is nonetheless heard as a single melody continuing "behind" the bursts of noise.

Formulation of the theory is credited to the [[Belgian]] psychologist [[Albert Michotte]] and [[Fabio Metelli]], an [[Italian people|Italian]] psychologist, with their work developed in recent years by [[E.S. Reed]] and the [[Gestalt psychology|Gestaltists]].

Modal completion is a similar phenomenon in which a shape is perceived to be occluding other shapes even when the shape itself is not drawn. Examples include the triangle that appears to be occluding three disks and an outlined triangle in the [[Kanizsa triangle]] and the circles and squares that appear in different versions of the [[Koffka cross]].

{{for|the concept in trademark law|trademark distinctiveness}}
'''Arbitrariness''' is the quality of being "determined by chance, whim, or impulse, and not by necessity, reason, or principle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/arbitrariness|title=arbitrariness|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=21 April 2018|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arbitrary decisions are not necessarily the same as [[random]] decisions.  For example, during the [[1973 oil crisis]], Americans were allowed to purchase gasoline only on odd-numbered days if their license plate was odd, and on even-numbered days if their license plate was even.  The system was well-defined and not random in its restrictions; however, since license plate numbers are completely unrelated to a person's fitness to purchase gasoline, it was still an arbitrary division of people.  Similarly, schoolchildren are often organized by their [[surname]] in alphabetical order, a non-random yet still arbitrary method, at least in cases where surnames are irrelevant.

==Law== 
''Arbitrary'' comes from the Latin ''arbitrarius'', the source of ''arbiter''; someone who is tasked to judge some matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=arbitrary Online Etymology Dictionary]: "'deciding by one's own discretion,' from L. arbitrarius, from arbiter (see arbiter). The original meaning gradually to mean ‘capricious’ (1646) and ‘despotic’ (1642).”&lt;/ref&gt;  An arbitrary legal judgment is a decision made at the discretion of the judge, not one that is fixed by  law.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Thomas.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=p31MAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA565&amp;lpg=PA565&amp;dq=%22discretion+of+the+judge%22+and+arbitrary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tl9MMK-av4&amp;sig=Zd8y_5GB9g8c-GX0qg87BHllhqo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ShbJSZylDcrJtgeM-IyUAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result#PPA565,M1 The London Encyclopaedia]'', page 565 (1829): “Arbitrary, and the words more immediately connected with it, signify that the decision of the arbiter is made in consequence of his own uncontrolled will, or in consequence of reasons which do not appear.”&lt;/ref&gt;  In some countries, a prohibition of arbitrariness is enshrined into the [[constitution]].  Article 9 of the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] theoretically overrides even democratic decisions in prohibiting arbitrary government action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/rs/1/101.en.pdf Federal Constitution of the Swiss Federation]. The Federal Authorities
of the Swiss Confederation.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] has overturned laws for having "[[Rational basis review|no rational basis]]."  A recent study of the U.S. asylum system suggests that arbitrariness in decision-making might be the cause of large disparities in outcomes between different adjudicators, a phenomenon described as [[refugee roulette]].

Article 330 of the Russian penal code defines 'Arbitrariness' as a specific crime, but with a very broad definition encompassing any 'actions contrary to the order presented by a law'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  |work=The Criminal Code Of The Russian Federation
  |title=Article 330. Arbitrariness
  |url=http://www.russian-criminal-code.com/PartII/SectionX/Chapter32.html
  |quote=Arbitrariness, that is the unauthorized commission of actions contrary to the order presented by a law or any other normative legal act, 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Arbitrary actions are closely related to [[teleology]], the study of purpose.  Actions lacking a ''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]'', a goal, are necessarily arbitrary.  With no end to measure against, there can be no standard applied to choices, so all decisions are alike.  Note that arbitrary or random methods in the standard sense of ''arbitrary'' may not qualify as arbitrary choices philosophically, if they were done in furtherance of a larger purpose; in the examples above, discipline in school and avoiding overcrowding at gas stations.

[[Nihilism]] is the philosophy that believes that there is no purpose in the universe, and that ''every'' choice is arbitrary.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, Bernd (1971). "Nihilism, Reason, and "The Good"." ''The Review of Metaphysics.'' '''25''' (2):292&amp;ndash;310.&lt;/ref&gt; According to nihilism, the universe contains no value and is essentially meaningless. Because the universe and all of its constituents contain no higher goal for us to make subgoals from, all aspects of human life and experiences are completely arbitrary. There is no right or wrong decision, thought or practice, and whatever choice a human being makes is just as meaningless and empty as any other choice he or she could have made.

Many brands of [[theism]], the belief in a [[deity]] or deities, believe that everything has a purpose and that ''nothing'' is arbitrary.  In these philosophies, God created the universe for a reason, and every event flows from that.  Even seemingly random events cannot escape God's hand and purpose.  This is somewhat related to the [[argument from design]], the argument for God's existence because a purpose can be found in the universe.

Arbitrariness is also related to [[ethics]], the philosophy of decision-making.  Even if a person has a goal, they may choose to attempt to achieve it in ways that may be considered arbitrary.  [[Rationalism]] holds that knowledge comes about through intellectual calculation and deduction; many rationalists (though not all) apply this to ethics as well.  All decisions should be made through reason and logic, not via whim or how one "feels" what is right.  Randomness may occasionally be acceptable as part of a subtask in furtherance of a larger goal, but not in general.

In [[semiotics]], the general theory of signs, sign systems, and sign processes, [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] introduced the notion of [[Course in General Linguistics#Arbitrariness|arbitrariness]] according to which there is no necessary connection between the material sign (or ''signifier'') and the entity it refers to or denotes as its meaning (or ''signified'') as a mental concept or real object.

==Mathematics==
In mathematics, arbitrary normally means "any;" for instance, an arbitrary division of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] or an arbitrary [[permutation]] of a sequence.  Its use implies generality and that a statement does not only apply to special cases &amp;ndash; "you may select any choice possible, and this statement will still hold."  A simple example would be "Given an arbitrary integer, multiplying it by two will result in an [[Even and odd numbers|even number]]."

Even further, the implication is that generality will hold even if you have an opponent choose the item in question.  In some ways ''arbitrary'' is here synonymous with ''worst-case''.&lt;ref&gt;Tel, Gérard (2000). ''Introduction to distributed algorithms.'' Cambridge University Press. p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research background ==
The behavioural synchrony model universe relies on two key sets of assumptions. The first set of assumptions concerns the structure of the network: it is assumed that (a) the agents form a [[social network]] in a way that the network is connected, i.e., all agents have some direct or indirect connection to every other agent, and [[Sparse network|sparse]], i.e., the network the agents form is not fully connected; and (b) all agents have the same [[Degree (graph theory)|network degree]], i.e., every agent is connected to the same number of other agents. In network science terms, the assumption is that the agents form a ''k''-regular ''n''-sized connected graph, where ''k'' is the degree of the agents, and ''n'' is the number of agents. The second set of assumptions concern the nature of coordination: it is assumed that the content of the coordination is not important (independent of whether it is a linguistic cue, cultural identity, or simple compass direction), but is set up in a way that the agents cannot guess the location of the final convergence point of the group from any individual information exchange. These assumptions cause coordination to slow, where the speed is dependent on the network structure, and the agents need to think hard during the coordination process.

The behavioural synchrony approach introduced behavioural realism into social network coordination, via assuming that the network structure is similar to actual human groups, and by making the coordination process not-trivial, and thus making the modelled group processes reflect [[Human behavior|human behaviour]]. The behavioural synchrony approach has led to a range of human application, especially concerning the human evolutionary past:
* Synchronisation of physical activity, especially of exertion, contributes to group bonding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Social hierarchy can be beneficial for collective action,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; but can lead to stratification and elite delineation that is harmful for collective action.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Dávid-Barrett|first = Tamás|last2 = Dunbar|first2 = R.

'''Constant conjunction''' is a phrase used in philosophy as a variant or near synonym for [[causality]] and [[inductive reasoning|induction]]. It can be construed to contradict a more common phrase: [[correlation is not causation]]. 

==Overview==
The philosopher [[David Hume]] used the phrase frequently in his discussion of the limits of [[empiricism]] to explain our ideas of causation and [[inference]]. In ''[[An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding]]'' and ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' Hume proposed that the origin of our knowledge of necessary connections arises out of observation of the ''constant conjunction'' of certain impressions across many instances. A more modern conception would argue that [[scientific law]] is distinguishable from a principle that arises merely accidentally because of the constant conjunction of one thing and another, but there is considerable controversy over what this distinguishing feature might be.

Although [[British empiricism]] and [[associationist]] philosophers elaborated on Hume's fundamental idea in many diverse ways, and metaphysicians like [[Immanuel Kant]] tried to dissipate the position,{{verification needed|date=October 2014}} the force of his arguments has remained remarkably robust, and they have found unexpected support in three scientific discoveries of the 20th century: [[Ivan Pavlov]]'s laws of conditioning; [[Donald O. Hebb|Hebbian]] [[biological neural network|neural network]]s; and spike-timing-dependent plasticity ([[STDP]]).

In Pavlov's framework, an [[unconditioned stimulus]] can follow in constant conjunction a conditioning/conditioned stimulus within a timeframe of milliseconds to several seconds, and result in the [[conditioned stimulus]] having many of the properties of the unconditioned stimulus. [[Donald O. Hebb|Donald Hebb]] explained this as an intrinsic property of [[cell assemblies]] within the nervous system to form connections within large cliques of cells whenever those cells fire together within a reasonably short period of time. (A modern shorthand for his ideas states: "Cells that fire together, wire together".) Modern [[neuroscience]] has confirmed this insight as a product of the activity of synapses and STDP, so structured to strengthen connections between cells that fire within very short periods (10s of milliseconds) of each other. The longer time periods of classical conditioning are presumably a large-number effect of cliques of these synapses and cells.

When two particles interact, their mutual '''cross section''' is the area [[transversality (mathematics)|transverse]] to their relative motion within which they must meet in order to [[scattering|scatter]] from each other. If the particles are hard [[Elasticity (physics)|inelastic]] [[spheres]] that interact only upon contact, their scattering cross section is related to their geometric size. If the particles interact through some action-at-a-distance force, such as [[electromagnetism]] or [[gravity]], their scattering cross section is generally larger than their geometric size. When a cross section is specified as a function of some final-state variable, such as particle angle or energy, it is called a '''differential cross section'''. When a cross section is integrated over all scattering angles (and possibly other variables), it is called a '''total cross section'''. Cross sections are typically denoted {{math|''σ''}} ([[sigma]]) and measured in units of area.

Scattering cross sections may be defined in [[nuclear physics|nuclear]], [[atomic physics|atomic]], and [[particle physics]] for collisions of accelerated beams of one type of particle with targets (either stationary or moving) of a second type of particle. The probability for any given reaction to occur is in proportion to its cross section. Thus, specifying the cross section for a given reaction is a proxy for stating the probability that a given scattering process will occur.

The measured [[reaction rate]] of a given process depends strongly on experimental variables such as the density of the target material, the intensity of the beam, the detection efficiency of the apparatus, or the angle setting of the detection apparatus. However, these quantities can be factored away, allowing measurement of the underlying two-particle collisional cross section.

Differential and total scattering cross sections are among the most important measurable quantities in [[nuclear physics|nuclear]], [[atomic physics|atomic]], and [[particle physics]].

== Collision among gas particles ==
[[File:CrossSectionFig1.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|'''Figure 1.''' In a gas of particles of individual diameter {{math|2''r''}}, the cross section {{math|''σ''}}, for collisions is related to the particle number density {{math|''n''}}, and mean free path between collisions {{math|''λ''}}.]]

In a [[gas]] of finite-sized particles there are collisions among particles that depend on their cross-sectional size. The average distance that a particle travels between collisions depends on the density of gas particles. These quantities are related by

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \frac{1}{n \lambda},&lt;/math&gt;

where
: {{math|''σ''}} is the cross section of a two-particle collision ([[SI]] units: m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;),
: {{math|''λ''}} is the [[mean free path]] between collisions (SI units: m),
: {{math|''n''}} is the [[number density]] of the target particles (SI units: m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;).

If the particles in the gas can be treated as hard spheres of radius {{math|''r''}} that interact by direct contact, as illustrated in Figure 1, then the effective cross section for the collision of a pair is

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \pi \left(2r\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

If the particles in the gas interact by a force with a larger range than their physical size, then the cross section is a larger effective area that may depend on a variety of variables such as the energy of the particles.

Cross sections can be computed for atomic collisions but also are used in the subatomic realm. For example, in [[nuclear physics]] a "gas" of low-energy [[neutrons]] collides with nuclei in a reactor or other nuclear device, with a [[Neutron cross section|cross section that is energy-dependent]] and hence also with well-defined [[mean free path]] between collisions.

== Attenuation of a beam of particles ==

If a beam of particles enters a thin layer of material of thickness {{math|d''z''}}, the flux {{math|''Φ''}} of the beam will decrease by {{math|d''Φ''}} according to

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm d \Phi}{\mathrm d z} = -n \sigma \Phi,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''σ''}} is the total cross section of ''all'' events, including [[scattering]], [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], or transformation to another species. The number density of scattering centers is designated by {{math|''n''}}. Solving this equation exhibits the exponential attenuation of the beam intensity:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi = \Phi_0 e^{-n \sigma z},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''Φ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the initial flux, and {{math|''z''}} is the total thickness of the material. For light, this is called the [[Beer–Lambert law]].

== Differential cross section ==

Consider a [[classical mechanics|classical]] measurement where a single particle is scattered off a single stationary target particle. Conventionally, a [[Spherical coordinate system]] is used, with the target placed at the origin and the {{math|''z''}} axis of this coordinate system aligned with the incident beam. The angle {{math|''θ''}} is the '''scattering angle''', measured between the incident beam and the scattered beam, and the {{math|''φ''}} is the [[azimuthal angle]].

:[[Image:Differential cross section.svg|none|600px]]

The [[impact parameter]] {{math|''b''}} is the perpendicular offset of the trajectory of the incoming particle, and the outgoing particle emerges at an angle {{math|''θ''}}. For a given interaction ([[Coulomb's law|Coulombic]], [[magnetism|magnetic]], [[gravitation]]al, contact, etc.), the impact parameter and the scattering angle have a definite one-to-one functional dependence on each other. Generally the impact parameter can neither be controlled nor measured from event to event and is assumed to take all possible values when averaging over many scattering events. The differential size of the cross section is the area element in the plane of the impact parameter, i.e. {{math|d''σ'' {{=}} ''b'' d''φ'' d''b''}}. The differential angular range of the scattered particle at angle {{math|''θ''}} is the solid angle element {{math|d''Ω'' {{=}} sin ''θ'' d''θ'' d''φ''}}. The differential cross section is the quotient of these quantities, {{math|{{sfrac|d''σ''|d''Ω''}}}}.

It is a function of the scattering angle (and therefore also the impact parameter), plus other observables such as the momentum of the incoming particle. The differential cross section is always taken to be positive, even though larger impact parameters generally produce less deflection. In cylindrically symmetric situations (about the beam axis), the [[azimuthal angle]] {{math|''φ''}} is not changed by the scattering process, and the differential cross section can be written as

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d} \sigma}{\mathrm{d}(\cos \theta)} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\mathrm{d} \sigma}{\mathrm{d} \Omega} \,\mathrm{d}\varphi &lt;/math&gt;.

In situations where the scattering process is not azimuthally symmetric, such as when the beam or target particles possess magnetic moments oriented perpendicular to the beam axis, the differential cross section must also be expressed as a function of the azimuthal angle.

For scattering of particles of incident flux {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;inc&lt;/sub&gt;}} off a stationary target consisting of many particles, the differential cross section {{math|{{sfrac|d''σ''|d''Ω''}}}} at an angle {{math|(''θ'',''φ'')}} is related to the flux of scattered particle detection {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;(''θ'',''φ'')}} in particles per unit time by

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d \Omega}(\theta,\varphi) = \frac{1}{n t \Delta\Omega} \frac{F_\text{out}(\theta,\varphi)}{F_\text{inc}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here {{math|Δ''Ω''}} is the finite angular size of the detector (SI unit: [[steradian|sr]]), {{math|''n''}} is the [[number density]] of the target particles (SI units: m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;), and {{math|''t''}} is the thickness of the stationary target (SI units: m). This formula assumes that the target is thin enough that each beam particle will interact with at most one target particle.

The total cross section {{math|''σ''}} may be recovered by integrating the differential cross section {{math|{{sfrac|d''σ''|d''Ω''}}}} over the full [[solid angle]] ({{math|4π}} steradians):

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \oint_{4\pi} \frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d \Omega} \, \mathrm d \Omega = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi \frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d \Omega} \sin \theta \, \mathrm d \theta \, \mathrm d \varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

It is common to omit the “differential” [[qualifier]] when the type of cross section can be inferred from context. In this case, {{math|''σ''}} may be referred to as the ''integral cross section'' or ''total cross section''. The latter term may be confusing in contexts where multiple events are involved, since “total” can also refer to the sum of cross sections over all events.

The differential cross section is extremely useful quantity in many fields of physics, as measuring it can reveal a great amount of information about the internal structure of the target particles. For example, the differential cross section of [[Rutherford scattering]] provided strong evidence for the existence of the atomic nucleus.

Instead of the solid angle, the [[momentum transfer]] may be used as the independent variable of differential cross sections.

Differential cross sections in inelastic scattering contain [[Resonance (particle physics)|resonance peaks]] that indicate the creation of metastable states and contain information about their energy and lifetime.

== Quantum scattering ==

In the [[stationary state|time-independent]] formalism of [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] scattering, the initial [[wave function]] (before scattering) is taken to be a plane wave with definite [[momentum]] {{math|''k''}}:

: &lt;math&gt;\phi_-(\mathbf r) \;\stackrel{r \to \infty}{\longrightarrow}\; e^{i k z},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''z''}} and {{math|''r''}} are the ''relative'' coordinates between the projectile and the target. The arrow indicates that this only describes the ''asymptotic behavior'' of the wave function when the projectile and target are too far apart for the interaction to have any effect.

After the scattering takes place, it is expected that the wave function takes on the following asymptotic form:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_+(\mathbf r) \;\stackrel{r \to \infty}{\longrightarrow}\; f(\theta,\phi) \frac{e^{i k r}}{r},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''f''}} is some function of the angular coordinates known as the [[scattering amplitude]]. This general form is valid for any short-ranged, energy-conserving interaction. It is not true for long-ranged interactions, so there are additional complications when dealing with electromagnetic interactions.

The full wave function of the system behaves asymptotically as the sum

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(\mathbf r) \;\stackrel{r \to \infty}{\longrightarrow}\; \phi_-(\mathbf r) + \phi_+(\mathbf r).&lt;/math&gt;

The differential cross section is related to the scattering amplitude:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d \Omega}(\theta, \phi) = \bigl|f(\theta, \phi)\bigr|^2.&lt;/math&gt;

This has the simple interpretation as the probability density for finding the scattered projectile at a given angle.

A cross section is therefore a measure of the effective surface area seen by the impinging particles, and as such is expressed in units of area. The cross section of two [[elementary particle|particles]] (i.e. observed when the two particles are [[collision|colliding]] with each other) is a measure of the interaction event between the two particles. The cross section is proportional to the probability that an interaction will occur; for example in a simple scattering experiment the number of particles scattered per unit of time (current of scattered particles {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}}) depends only on the number of incident particles per unit of time (current of incident particles {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), the characteristics of target (for example the number of particles per unit of surface {{math|''N''}}), and the type of interaction. For {{math|''Nσ'' ≪ 1}} we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
I_\text{r} &amp;= I_\text{i}N\sigma, \\
\sigma &amp;= \frac{I_\text{r}}{I_\text{i}} \frac{1}{N} \\
&amp;= \text{probability of interaction} \times \frac{1}{N}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Relation to the S-matrix ===

If the [[reduced mass]]es and [[momentum|momenta]] of the colliding system are {{math|''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''m&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;}} before and after the collision respectively, the differential cross section is given by{{clarify|reason=This section is an uncontextualized leap. We have jumped, without announcement, from the Schrödinger PDE for a wave in a potential to the language of QFT for two particles colliding.|date=September 2016}}
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm d\sigma}{\mathrm d\Omega} = \left(2\pi\right)^4 m_i m_f \frac{p_f}{p_i} \bigl|T_{fi}\bigr|^2,&lt;/math&gt;

where the on-shell {{math|''T''}} matrix is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;S_{fi} = \delta_{fi} - 2\pi i \delta\left(E_f - E_i\right) \delta\left(\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{p}_f\right) T_{fi}&lt;/math&gt;

in terms of the [[S-matrix]]. Here {{math|''δ''}} is the [[Dirac delta function]]. The computation of the S-matrix is the main goal of the [[scattering theory]].

== Units ==

Although the [[SI unit]] of total cross sections is [[square meter|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], smaller units are usually used in practice.

In nuclear and particle physics, the conventional unit is the barn [[barn (unit)|b]], where 1&amp;nbsp;b = 10&lt;sup&gt;−28&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 100&amp;nbsp;[[femtometre|fm]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th|pages=127–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller [[metric prefix|prefixed]] units such as [[milli-|mb]] and [[micro-|μb]] are also widely used. Correspondingly, the differential cross section can be measured in units such as mb/sr.

When the scattered radiation is visible light, it is conventional to measure the path length in [[centimetre]]s. To avoid the need for conversion factors, the scattering cross section is expressed in cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the number concentration in cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;. The measurement of the scattering of visible light is known as [[nephelometry]], and is effective for particles of 2–50&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]] in diameter: as such, it is widely used in [[meteorology]] and in the measurement of [[atmospheric pollution]].

The scattering of [[X-ray]]s can also be described in terms of scattering cross sections, in which case the square [[ångström]] is a convenient unit: 1&amp;nbsp;Å&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;−20&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = {{val|10000|u=[[picometre|pm]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} = 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;b.

== Scattering of light ==

For light, as in other settings, the scattering cross section is generally different from the [[cross sectional area|geometrical cross section]] of a particle, and it depends upon the [[wavelength]] of light and the [[permittivity]], shape and size of the particle. The total amount of scattering in a sparse medium is proportional to the product of the scattering cross section and the number of particles present.

In terms of area, the ''total cross section'' ({{mvar|σ}}) is the sum of the cross sections due to [[absorption cross section|absorption]], [[scattering]] and [[luminescence]]{{clarify|reason=Is scattering "removal of light from a beam"? Then this characterization should be stated explicitly. Also, it should be explained that luminescence removes light from the direct beam (if this is true), even though one normally associates luminescence with adding light.|date=September 2016}}. The sum of the absorption and scattering cross sections is sometimes referred to as the extinction cross section.
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \sigma_\text{a} + \sigma_\text{s} + \sigma_\text{l}.&lt;/math&gt;
The total cross section is related to the [[absorbance]] of the light intensity through the [[Beer–Lambert law]], which says that absorbance is proportional to particle concentration:
:&lt;math&gt;A_\lambda = C l \sigma,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the absorbance at a given [[wavelength]] {{math|''λ''}}, {{math|''C''}} is the particle concentration as a number density, and {{math|''l''}} is the [[path length]]. The absorbance of the radiation is the [[logarithm]] ([[Decadic logarithm|decadic]] or, more usually, [[Natural logarithm|natural]]) of the reciprocal of the [[transmittance]] {{mathcal|T}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=2. Spectrophotometry|isbn=81-219-2633-5|first=P. K.|last=Bajpai|title=Biological Instrumentation and Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=THq-cOPO8RQC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=%22extinction+coefficient%22+transmittance+length+concentration}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A_\lambda = -\log \mathcal{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Scattering of light on extended bodies ==

In the context of scattering light on extended bodies, the scattering cross section, {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;scat&lt;/sub&gt;}}, describes the likelihood of light being [[scattering|scattered]] by a macroscopic particle. In general, the scattering cross section is different from the [[cross sectional area|geometrical cross section]] of a particle, as it depends upon the [[wavelength]] of light and the [[permittivity]] in addition to the shape and size of the particle. The total amount of scattering in a sparse medium is determined by the product of the scattering cross section and the number of particles present. In terms of area, the ''total cross section'' ({{math|''σ''}}) is the sum of the cross sections due to [[absorption cross section|absorption]], [[scattering]] and [[luminescence]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \sigma_\text{a} + \sigma_\text{s} + \sigma_\text{l}.&lt;/math&gt;

The total cross section is related to the [[absorbance]] of the light intensity through the [[Beer–Lambert law]], which says that absorbance is proportional to concentration: {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''Clσ''}}, where {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the absorbance at a given [[wavelength]] {{math|''λ''}}, {{math|''C''}} is the concentration as a [[number density]], and {{math|''l''}} is the [[path length]]. The extinction or [[absorbance]] of the radiation is the [[logarithm]] ([[Decadic logarithm|decadic]] or, more usually, [[Natural logarithm|natural]]) of the reciprocal of the [[transmittance]] {{mathcal|T}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=2. Spectrophotometry|isbn=81-219-2633-5|first=P. K.|last=Bajpai|title=Biological Instrumentation and Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=THq-cOPO8RQC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=%22extinction+coefficient%22+transmittance+length+concentration}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A_\lambda = - \log \mathcal{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Relation to physical size ===
There is no simple relationship between the scattering cross section and the physical size of the particles, as the scattering cross section depends on the wavelength of radiation used. This can be seen when driving in [[fog]]gy weather: the droplets of water (which form the fog) scatter red light less than they scatter the shorter wavelengths present in white light, and the red rear fog light can be distinguished more clearly than the white headlights of an approaching vehicle. That is to say that the scattering cross section of the water droplets is smaller for red light than for light of shorter wavelengths, even though the physical size of the particles is the same.

=== Meteorological range ===

The scattering cross section is related to the [[visibility|meteorological range]] {{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;}}:

:&lt;math&gt;L_\text{V} = \frac{3.9}{C \sigma_\text{scat}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The quantity {{math|''Cσ''&lt;sub&gt;scat&lt;/sub&gt;}} is sometimes denoted {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;scat&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the scattering coefficient per unit length.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Scattering cross section, {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;scat&lt;/sub&gt;}}|file=S05490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Example 1: elastic collision of two hard spheres ===

The elastic collision of two hard spheres is an instructive example that demonstrates the sense of calling this quantity a cross section. {{math|''R''}} and {{math|''r''}} are respectively the radii of the scattering center and scattered sphere.
The total cross section is

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_\text{tot} = \pi \left(r + R\right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

So in this case the total scattering cross section is equal to the area of the circle (with radius {{math|''r'' + ''R''}}) within which the center of mass of the incoming sphere has to arrive for it to be deflected, and outside which it passes by the stationary scattering center.

=== Example 2: scattering light from a 2D circular mirror ===

Another example illustrates the details of the calculation of a simple [[light]] scattering model obtained by a reduction of the dimension. For simplicity, we will consider the scattering of a beam of light on a plane treated as a uniform density of parallel rays and within the framework of [[geometrical optics]] from a circle with radius {{math|''r''}} with a perfectly reflecting boundary. Its three-dimensional equivalent is therefore the more difficult problem of a laser or flashlight light scattering from the mirror sphere, for example, from the mechanical bearing ball.&lt;ref&gt;

|bibcode = 2003OptCo.226....1X}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The unit of cross section in one dimension is the unit of length, for example 1&amp;nbsp;m. Let {{math|''α''}} be the angle between the [[ray (optics)|light ray]] and the [[radius]] joining the reflection point of the light ray with the center point of the circle mirror. Then the increase of the length element perpendicular to the light beam is expressed by this angle as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm dx = r \cos \alpha \,\mathrm d \alpha,&lt;/math&gt;
the reflection angle of this ray with respect to the incoming ray is then {{math|2''α''}}, and the scattering angle is
:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \pi - 2 \alpha.&lt;/math&gt;
The energy or the number of photons reflected from the light beam with the intensity or density of photons {{math|''I''}} on the length {{math|d''x''}} is 
:&lt;math&gt;I \,\mathrm d \sigma = I \,\mathrm dx(x) = I r \cos \alpha \,\mathrm d \alpha = I \frac{r}{2} \sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \,\mathrm d \theta = I \frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d \theta} \,\mathrm d \theta.&lt;/math&gt;
The differential cross section is therefore ({{math|d''Ω'' {{=}} d''θ''}})
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d \theta} = \frac{r}{2} \sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).&lt;/math&gt; 
As it is seen from the behaviour of the [[sine]] function, this quantity has the maximum for the backward scattering ({{math|''θ'' {{=}} π}}; the light is reflected perpendicularly and returns), and the zero minimum for the scattering from the edge of the circle directly forward ({{math|''θ'' {{=}} 0}}). It confirms the intuitive expectations that the mirror circle acts like a diverging [[lens (optics)|lens]], and a thin beam is more diluted the closer it is from the edge defined with respect to the incoming direction. The total cross section can be obtained by summing (integrating) the differential section of the entire range of angles:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \int_0^{2 \pi} \frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d \theta} \,\mathrm d \theta = \int_0^{2 \pi} \frac{r}{2} \sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \,\mathrm d \theta = \left. -r \cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \right|_0^{2 \pi} = 2 r,&lt;/math&gt; 
so it is equal as much as the circular mirror is totally screening the two-dimensional space for the beam of light. In three dimensions for the mirror ball with the radius {{math|''r''}} it is therefore equal {{math|''σ'' {{=}} π''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

=== Example 3: scattering light from a 3D spherical mirror ===

We can now use the result from the Example 2 to calculate the differential cross section for the light scattering from the perfectly reflecting sphere in three dimensions. Let us denote now the radius of the sphere as {{math|''a''}}. Let us parametrize the plane perpendicular to the incoming light beam by the cylindrical coordinates {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''φ''}}. In any plane of the incoming and the reflected ray we can write now from the previous example:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
r &amp;= a \sin \alpha,\\
\mathrm dr &amp;= a \cos \alpha \,\mathrm d \alpha,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
while the impact area element is 
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm d \sigma = \mathrm d r(r) \times r \,\mathrm d \varphi = \frac{a^2}{2} \sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \,\mathrm d \theta \,\mathrm d \varphi.&lt;/math&gt;
Using the relation for the solid angle in the spherical coordinates:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm d\Omega = \sin \theta \,\mathrm d \theta \,\mathrm d \varphi&lt;/math&gt;
and the trigonometric identity
:&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta = 2 \sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d \Omega} = \frac{a^2}{4},&lt;/math&gt; 
while the total cross section as we expected is
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \oint_{4 \pi} \frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d \Omega} \,\mathrm d \Omega = \pi a^2.&lt;/math&gt;
As one can see, it also agrees with the result from the Example 1 if the photon is assumed to be a rigid sphere of zero radius.

The '''doctrine of indivisibility''' (or '''indivisibility doctrine''') was a [[legal doctrine]] in [[United States copyright law]], which held that a [[copyright]] was a single, indivisible right that its owner could only [[Assignment (law)|assign]] as a whole.  The doctrine was founded upon the policy concern that a [[defendant]] alleged to have infringed a single work might find himself facing claims from multiple [[plaintiff]]s, all claiming copyright in that same work.  Despite the indivisibility doctrine, a copyright holder could still effectively assign certain rights.  The assignees of those rights were held to be "mere licensees."

This doctrine could yield a harsh result for an exclusive licensee in a work.  If a third party [[Copyright infringement|infringed]] the work, the copyright holder had no motivation to file suit---the work was no longer marketable.  So courts allowed exclusive licensees to compulsively join the copyright holder as a plaintiff in such suits.  Non-exclusive licensees could not forcefully join copyright holders, on the theory that in those cases, the work was still marketable and the copyright holder therefore had an interest in protecting his rights.

In the case ''[[Dark Passage|Goodis v. United Artists Television, Inc.]]'', 425 [[Federal Reporter|F.2d]] 397, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] held that the doctrine of indivisibility could not operate to wholly deprive an author of his copyright when a "mere licensee" secured a copyright in a [[Collective work (US)|collective work]] but the author never secured a separate copyright on his own.

The doctrine of indivisibility was expressly eliminated in the [[Copyright Act of 1976]]. Assignees of rights in a copyrighted work now have standing to directly file suit against infringers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10010">In [[mathematics]], particularly [[differential topology]], the '''double tangent bundle''' or the '''second tangent bundle''' refers to the [[tangent bundle]] {{nowrap|(''TTM'',''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TTM''&lt;/sub&gt;,''TM'')}} of the total space ''TM'' of the [[tangent bundle]] {{nowrap|(''TM'',''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;,''M'')}} of a [[differentiable manifold|smooth manifold]] ''M''
.&lt;ref&gt;J.M.Lee, ''Introduction to Smooth Manifolds'', Springer-Verlag, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; A note on notation: in this article, we denote projection maps by their domains, e.g., ''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TTM''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''TTM'' → ''TM''. Some authors index these maps by their ranges instead, so for them, that map would be written ''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The second tangent bundle arises in the study of [[Connection (vector bundle)|connections]] and second order ordinary differential equations, i.e., [[spray (mathematics)|(semi)spray structures]] on smooth manifolds, and it is not to be confused with the [[jet bundle|second order jet bundle]].

== Secondary vector bundle structure and canonical flip ==

Since {{nowrap|(''TM'',''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;,''M'')}} is a vector bundle on its own right, its tangent bundle has the [[secondary vector bundle structure]] {{nowrap|(''TTM'',(''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;,''TM''),}} where {{nowrap|(''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;:''TTM''&amp;rarr;''TM''}} is the push-forward of the canonical projection {{nowrap|''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;:''TM''&amp;rarr;''M''.}}
In the following we denote

:&lt;math&gt;
\xi = \xi^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Big|_x\in T_xM, \qquad X = X^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Big|_x\in T_xM
&lt;/math&gt;

and apply the associated coordinate system

:&lt;math&gt;
\xi \mapsto (x^1,\ldots,x^n,\xi^1,\ldots,\xi^n)
&lt;/math&gt;

on ''TM''. Then the fibre of the secondary vector bundle structure at ''X''&amp;isin;''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' takes the form

:&lt;math&gt;
(\pi_{TM})^{-1}_*(X) = \Big\{ \ X^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Big|_\xi + Y^k\frac{\partial}{\partial\xi^k}\Big|_\xi
\ \Big| \ \xi\in T_xM \ , \ Y^1,\ldots,Y^n\in\R \ \Big\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The double tangent bundle is a [[double vector bundle]].

The '''canonical flip'''&lt;ref&gt;P.Michor. ''Topics in Differential Geometry,'' American Mathematical Society, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; is a smooth involution ''j'':''TTM''&amp;rarr;''TTM'' that exchanges these vector space structures
in the sense that it is a vector bundle isomorphism between {{nowrap|(''TTM'',''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TTM''&lt;/sub&gt;,''TM'')}} and {{nowrap|(''TTM'',(''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;,''TM'').}} In the associated coordinates on ''TM'' it reads as

:&lt;math&gt;
j\Big(X^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Big|_\xi + Y^k\frac{\partial}{\partial \xi^k}\Big|_\xi\Big)
= \xi^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\Big|_X + Y^k\frac{\partial}{\partial \xi^k}\Big|_X.
&lt;/math&gt;

The canonical flip has the property that for any ''f'': '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; ''M'', 
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac {\partial f} {{\partial t} {\partial s}} = j \circ \frac {\partial f} {{\partial s} {\partial t}}
&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''s'' and ''t'' are coordinates of the standard basis of '''R''' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Note that both partial derivatives are functions from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to ''TTM''.

This property can, in fact, be used to give an intrinsic definition of the canonical flip.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Fisher and H. Turner Laquer, Second Order Tangent Vectors in Riemannian Geometry, J. Korean Math. Soc. 36 (1999), No. 5, pp. 959-1008&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, there is a submersion
''p'': J&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,M) &amp;rarr; ''TTM'' given by 
:&lt;math&gt;
p([f])=\frac {\partial f} {{\partial t} {\partial s}} (0,0)
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''p'' can be defined in the space of two-jets at zero because only depends on ''f'' up to order two at zero. We consider the application:
:&lt;math&gt;
J: J^2_0(\mathbb{R}^2,M) \to J^2_0(\mathbb{R}^2,M) \quad / \quad J([f])=[f \circ \alpha]
&lt;/math&gt;
where &amp;alpha;(''s'',''t'')= (''t'',''s''). Then ''J'' is compatible with the projection ''p'' and induces the canonical flip on the quotient ''TTM''.

== Canonical tensor fields on the tangent bundle==

As for any [[vector bundle]], the tangent spaces {{nowrap|''T''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;xi;&lt;/sub&gt;(''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'')}} of the fibres ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' of the tangent bundle {{nowrap|(''TM'',''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;,''M'')}} can be identified with the fibres ''T''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' themselves. Formally this is achieved though the '''vertical lift''', which is a natural vector space isomorphism
{{nowrap|vl&lt;sub&gt;&amp;xi;&lt;/sub&gt;:''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''&amp;rarr;''V''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;xi;&lt;/sub&gt;(''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'')}} defined as

:&lt;math&gt;
(\operatorname{vl}_\xi X)[f]:=\frac{d}{dt}\Big|_{t=0}f(x,\xi+tX), \qquad f\in C^\infty(TM).
&lt;/math&gt;

The vertical lift can also be seen as a natural vector bundle isomorphism
{{nowrap|vl:(&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''TM''&amp;rarr;''VTM''}}
from the pullback bundle of {{nowrap|(''TM'',''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;,''M'')}} over {{nowrap|''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;:''TM''&amp;rarr;''M''}} onto the vertical tangent bundle

:&lt;math&gt;
VTM:=\operatorname{Ker}(\pi_{TM})_* \subset TTM.
&lt;/math&gt;

The vertical lift lets us define the '''canonical vector field'''

:&lt;math&gt;
V:TM\to TTM; \qquad V_\xi := \operatorname{vl}_\xi\xi,
&lt;/math&gt;

which is smooth in the slit tangent bundle ''TM''\0. The canonical vector field can be also defined as the infinitesimal generator of the Lie-group action

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb R\times (TM\setminus 0) \to TM\setminus 0; \qquad (t,\xi) \mapsto e^t\xi.
&lt;/math&gt;

Unlike the canonical vector field, which can be defined for any vector bundle, the '''canonical endomorphism'''

:&lt;math&gt;
J:TTM\to TTM; \qquad J_\xi X := \operatorname{vl}_\xi(\pi_{TM})_*X, \qquad X\in T_\xi TM
&lt;/math&gt;

is special to the tangent bundle. The canonical endomorphism ''J'' satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{Ran}(J)=\operatorname{Ker}(J)=VTM, \qquad \mathcal L_VJ= -J, \qquad J[X,Y]=J[JX,Y]+J[X,JY],
&lt;/math&gt;

and it is also known as the '''tangent structure''' for the following reason. If (''E'',''p'',''M'') is any vector bundle
with the canonical vector field ''V'' and a (1,1)-tensor field ''J'' that satisfies the properties listed above, with ''VE'' in place of ''VTM'', then the vector bundle (''E'',''p'',''M'') is isomorphic to the tangent bundle {{nowrap|(''TM'',''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;''TM''&lt;/sub&gt;,''M'')}} of the base manifold, and ''J'' corresponds to the tangent structure of ''TM'' in this isomorphism.

There is also a stronger result of this kind &lt;ref&gt;D.S.Goel, ''Almost Tangent Structures'', Kodai Math.Sem.Rep. '''26''' (1975), 187-193.&lt;/ref&gt; which states that if ''N'' is a 2''n''-dimensional manifold and if there exists a (1,1)-tensor field ''J'' on ''N'' that satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{Ran}(J)=\operatorname{Ker}(J), \qquad J[X,Y]=J[JX,Y]+J[X,JY],
&lt;/math&gt;

then ''N'' is diffeomorphic to an open set of the total space of a tangent bundle of some ''n''-dimensional manifold ''M'', and ''J'' corresponds to the tangent structure of ''TM'' in this diffeomorphism.

In any associated coordinate system on ''TM'' the canonical vector field and the canonical endomorphism have the coordinate representations

:&lt;math&gt;
V = \xi^k\frac{\partial}{\partial \xi^k}, \qquad J = dx^k\otimes\frac{\partial}{\partial \xi^k}.
&lt;/math&gt;

== (Semi)spray structures ==

A [[Spray (mathematics)|Semispray structure]] on a smooth manifold ''M'' is by definition a smooth vector field ''H'' on ''TM''&amp;nbsp;\0 such that ''JH''=''V''. An equivalent definition is that ''j''(''H'')=''H'', where ''j'':''TTM''&amp;rarr;''TTM'' is the canonical flip. A semispray ''H'' is a [[Spray (mathematics)|spray]], if in addition, [''V'',''H'']=''H''.

Spray and semispray structures are invariant versions of second order ordinary differential equations on ''M''. The difference between spray and semispray structures is that the solution curves of sprays are invariant in positive [[Parametrization|reparametrizations]]{{jargon-inline|reason=What makes a reparametrization positive?|date=September 2015}} as point sets on ''M'', whereas solution curves of semisprays typically are not.

== Nonlinear covariant derivatives on smooth manifolds ==

The canonical flip makes it possible to define nonlinear covariant derivatives on smooth manifolds as follows. Let
:&lt;math&gt;
T(TM\setminus 0) = H(TM\setminus 0) \oplus V(TM\setminus 0)
&lt;/math&gt;
be an [[Ehresmann connection]] on the slit tangent bundle ''TM''/0 and consider the mapping
:&lt;math&gt;
D:(TM\setminus 0)\times \Gamma(TM) \to TM; \quad D_XY :=  (\kappa\circ j)(Y_*X),
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;:''TM''&amp;rarr;''TTM'' is the push-forward, ''j'':''TTM''&amp;rarr;''TTM'' is the canonical flip and &amp;kappa;:''T''(''TM''/0)&amp;rarr;''TM''/0 is the connector map. The mapping ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; is a derivation in the module &amp;Gamma;&amp;nbsp;(''TM'') of smooth vector fields on ''M'' in the sense that

* &lt;math&gt;D_X(\alpha Y + \beta Z) = \alpha D_XY + \beta D_XZ, \qquad \alpha,\beta\in\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;D_X(fY) = X[f]Y + f D_XY, \qquad \qquad \qquad f\in C^\infty(M)&lt;/math&gt;.

Any mapping ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; with these properties is called a '''(nonlinear) covariant derivative'''
&lt;ref&gt;I.Bucataru, R.Miron, ''Finsler-Lagrange Geometry'', Editura Academiei Române, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; on ''M''.
The term ''nonlinear'' refers to the fact that this kind of covariant derivative ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; on is not necessarily linear with respect to the direction ''X''&amp;isin;''TM''/0 of the differentiation.

Looking at the local representations one can confirm that the Ehresmann connections on (''TM''/0,&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;''TM''/0&lt;/sub&gt;,''M'') and nonlinear covariant derivatives on ''M'' are in one-to-one correspondence. Furthermore, if ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; is linear in ''X'', then the Ehresmann connection is linear in the [[secondary vector bundle structure]], and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; coincides with its linear covariant derivative.

'''Downrange''' is the horizontal distance traveled by a [[spacecraft]], or the spacecraft's horizontal distance from the [[launch pad|launch site]].  More often, it is used as an adverb or adjective specifying the direction of that travel being measured in a horizontal direction.

In military slang, ''downrange'' is a term for being deployed overseas, usually in a war zone. It is also the name of a comic strip published in the newspaper [[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]].{{cn|date=March 2014}} It can also refer to the direction of fire: away from the source and in the direction of the target.

Research concerning the relationship between the [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] quantity [[entropy]] and the [[evolution]] of [[life]] began around the turn of the 20th century.  In 1910, American historian [[Henry Brooks Adams|Henry Adams]] printed and distributed to university libraries and history professors the small volume ''A Letter to American Teachers of History'' proposing a theory of [[history]] based on the [[second law of thermodynamics]] and on the principle of entropy.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Henry. (1986). History of the United States of America During the Administration of Thomas Jefferson (pg. 1299). Library of America.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Henry. (1910). A Letter to American Teachers of History.
[https://books.google.com/books?id=gaLdOOzuiKAC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=A+Letter+to+American+Teachers+of+History#PPA10,M1 Google Books], [https://archive.org/details/alettertoamerica00adamuoft Scanned PDF]. Washington.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1944 book ''[[What is Life? (Schrödinger)|What is Life?]]'' by [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]]-laureate [[physicist]] [[Erwin Schrödinger]] stimulated research in the field.  In his book, Schrödinger originally stated that life feeds on negative entropy, or [[negentropy]] as it is sometimes called, but in a later edition corrected himself in response to complaints and stated the true source is [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]].  More recent work has restricted the discussion to [[Gibbs free energy]] because biological processes on Earth normally occur at a constant temperature and pressure, such as in the atmosphere or at the bottom of an ocean, but not across both over short periods of time for individual organisms.

==Origin==
In 1863, [[Rudolf Clausius]] published his noted memoir "On the Concentration of Rays of Heat and Light, and on the Limits of Its Action" wherein he outlined a preliminary relationship, as based on his own work and that of [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]], between his newly developed concept of entropy and life.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}  Building on this, one of the first to speculate on a possible thermodynamic perspective of [[evolution]] was the Austrian physicist [[Ludwig Boltzmann]].  In 1875, building on the works of Clausius and Kelvin, Boltzmann reasoned:

{{quote|The general struggle for existence of animate beings is not a struggle for raw materials – these, for organisms, are air, water and soil, all abundantly available – nor for energy which exists in plenty in any body in the form of heat, but a ''struggle for [negative] entropy'', which becomes available through the transition of energy from the ''hot sun'' to the ''cold earth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Boltzmann | first = Ludwig  | title = The second law of thermodynamics (Theoretical physics and philosophical problems)| publisher = Springer-Verlag New York, LLC | year = 1974 | isbn = 978-90-277-0250-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;!--Anyone know what this image is supposed to be illustrating?--&gt;
&lt;!--[[File:Solar-gradient.jpg|650px|center|thumb|The [[solar system]] from a [[System (thermodynamics)|thermodynamic systems]] perspective.]]--&gt;

==Early views==
In 1876, American civil engineer [[Richard Sears McCulloh]], in his ''Treatise on the Mechanical Theory of Heat and its Application to the Steam-Engine'', which was an early thermodynamics textbook, states, after speaking about the laws of the physical world, that "there are none that are established on a firmer basis than the two general propositions of [[James Prescott Joule|Joule]] and [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Carnot]]; which constitute the fundamental laws of our subject."  McCulloch then goes on to show that these two laws may be combined in a single expression as follows:

::&lt;math&gt; S = \int { dQ \over \tau } &lt;/math&gt;

where

::&lt;math&gt; S = &lt;/math&gt; entropy
::&lt;math&gt; dQ = &lt;/math&gt; a differential amount of [[heat]] passed into a [[System (thermodynamics)|thermodynamic system]]
::&lt;math&gt; \tau = &lt;/math&gt; [[thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]]

McCulloch then declares that the applications of these two laws, i.e. what are currently known as the [[first law of thermodynamics]] and the [[second law of thermodynamics]], are innumerable.  He then states:

{{quote|When we reflect how generally physical phenomena are connected with thermal changes and relations, it at once becomes obvious that there are few, if any, branches of [[natural science]]  which are not more or less dependent upon the great truths under consideration.  Nor should it, therefore, be a matter of surprise that already, in the short space of time, not yet one generation, elapsed since the [[Theory of heat|mechanical theory of heat]] has been freely adopted, whole branches of physical science have been revolutionized by it.&lt;ref name="McCulloch1876"&gt;{{cite book|last=McCulloch|first=Richard Sears|title=Treatise on the mechanical theory of heat and its applications to the steam-engine, etc.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=96AAAAAAMAAJ|location=New York|publisher=D. Van Nostrand|year=1876}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p. 267}}}}

McCulloch then gives a few of what he calls the “more interesting examples” of the application of these laws in extent and utility.  The first example he gives is [[physiology]], wherein he states that “the body of an animal, not less than a steamer, or a locomotive, is truly a [[heat engine]], and the consumption of food in the one is precisely analogous to the burning of fuel in the other; in both, the [[chemical reaction|chemical process]] is the same: that called [[combustion]].”  He then incorporates a discussion of [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier]]’s theory of respiration with cycles of digestion and excretion, perspiration, but then contradicts Lavoisier with recent findings, such as internal heat generated by friction, according to the new [[theory of heat]], which, according to McCulloch, states that the “heat of the body generally and uniformly is diffused instead of being concentrated in the chest”.  McCulloch then gives an example of the second law, where he states that [[friction]], especially in the smaller blooded-vessels, must develop heat.  Without doubt, animal heat is thus in part produced. He then asks: “but whence the expenditure of energy causing that friction, and which must be itself accounted for?"

To answer this question he turns to the mechanical theory of heat and goes on to loosely outline how the heart is what he calls a “force-pump”, which receives blood and sends it to every part of the body, as discovered by [[William Harvey]], that “acts like the piston of an engine and is dependent upon and consequently due to the cycle of nutrition and excretion which sustains physical or organic life.”  It is likely, here, that McCulloch was modeling parts of this argument on that of the famous [[Carnot cycle]].  In conclusion, he summarizes his first and second law argument as such:

{{quote|Everything physical being subject to the [[conservation of energy|law of conservation of energy]], it follows that no physiological action can take place except with expenditure of [[energy]] derived from food; also, that an animal performing [[mechanical work]] must from the same quantity of food generate less heat than one abstaining from exertion, the difference being precisely the [[Mechanical equivalent of heat|heat equivalent]] of that of work.&lt;ref name="McCulloch1876"/&gt;{{Rp|p. 270}}}}

==Negative entropy==
In the 1944 book ''[[What is Life? (Schrödinger)|What is Life?]]'', [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]]-laureate [[physicist]] [[Erwin Schrödinger]] theorizes that [[life]], contrary to the general tendency dictated by the [[Second law of thermodynamics]], decreases or maintains its entropy by feeding on negative entropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Schrödinger | first = Erwin  | title = [[What is Life – the Physical Aspect of the Living Cell]] | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1944 | isbn = 0-521-42708-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his note to Chapter 6 of ''What is Life?'', however, Schrödinger remarks on his usage of the term negative entropy:

{{quote|Let me say first, that if I had been catering for them [physicists] alone I should have let the discussion turn on ''[[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]'' instead. It is the more familiar notion in this context. But this highly technical term seemed linguistically too near to ''[[energy]]'' for making the average reader alive to the contrast between the two things.}}

This is what is argued to differentiate life from other forms of [[matter]] organization.  In this direction, although life's dynamics may be argued to go against the tendency of second law, which states that the entropy of an isolated system tends to increase, it does not in any way conflict or invalidate this law, because the principle that entropy can only increase or remain constant applies only to a [[closed system]] which is adiabatically isolated, meaning no [[heat]] can enter or leave.  Whenever a system can exchange either heat or matter with its environment, an entropy decrease of that system is entirely compatible with the second law.&lt;ref name="Denbigh"&gt;The common justification for this argument, for example, according to renowned chemical engineer Kenneth Denbigh, from his 1955 book ''The Principles of Chemical Equilibrium'', is that "living organisms are [[open system (systems theory)|open]] to their environment and can build up at the expense of foodstuffs which they take in and degrade."&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of organization in living systems increasing despite the second law is known as the Schrödinger paradox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schneider|first1=Eric D.|last2=Sagan|first2=Dorion|title=Into the Cool: Energy Flow Thermodynamics and Life|year=2005|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, United States|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, [[James Lovelock]] was among a group of scientists who were requested by [[NASA]] to make a theoretical life detection system to look for [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]] during the upcoming space mission.  When thinking about this problem, Lovelock wondered “how can we be sure that Martian life, if any, will reveal itself to tests based on Earth’s lifestyle?”&lt;ref name="gaia"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Lovelock | first = James | title = GAIA – A New Look at Life on Earth | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1979 | isbn = 0-19-286218-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To Lovelock, the basic question was “What is life, and how should it be recognized?”  When speaking about this issue with some of his colleagues at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], he was asked what he would do to look for life on Mars. To this, Lovelock replied "I’d look for an entropy reduction, since this must be a general characteristic of life."&lt;ref name="gaia" /&gt;

==Gibbs free energy and biological evolution==
In recent years, the thermodynamic interpretation of evolution in relation to entropy has begun to utilize the concept of the [[Gibbs free energy]], rather than entropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last= Moroz |first= Adam |title= The Common Extremalities in Biology and Physics |publisher= Elsevier |year= 2012 |isbn= 978-0-12-385187-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because biological processes on earth take place at roughly constant temperature and pressure, a situation in which the Gibbs free energy is an especially useful way to express the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. The Gibbs free energy is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta G \equiv \Delta H-T \, \Delta S &lt;/math&gt;

The minimization of the Gibbs free energy is a form of the [[principle of minimum energy]], which follows from the [[entropy maximization principle]] for closed systems.  Moreover, the Gibbs free energy equation, in modified form, can be utilized for [[open system (systems theory)|open systems]] when [[chemical potential]] terms are included in the energy balance equation. In a popular 1982 textbook, ''Principles of Biochemistry'', noted American biochemist [[Albert L. Lehninger|Albert Lehninger]] argues that the order produced within cells as they grow and divide is more than compensated for by the disorder they create in their surroundings in the course of growth and division.  In short, according to Lehninger, "living organisms preserve their internal order by taking from their surroundings [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]], in the form of nutrients or sunlight, and returning to their surroundings an equal amount of energy as heat and entropy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Lehninger | first = Albert  | title = Principles of Biochemistry, 2nd Ed. | publisher = Worth Publishers | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-87901-711-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, according to the chemist [[John Scales Avery|John Avery]], from his 2003 book ''Information Theory and Evolution'', we find a presentation in which the phenomenon of life, including its origin and evolution, as well as human cultural evolution, has its basis in the background of [[thermodynamics]], [[statistical mechanics]], and [[information theory]].  The (apparent) paradox between the [[second law of thermodynamics]] and the high degree of order and complexity produced by living systems, according to Avery, has its resolution "in the information content of the [[Gibbs free energy]] that enters the biosphere from outside sources."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Avery | first = John  | title = Information Theory and Evolution | publisher = World Scientific | year = 2003 | isbn = 981-238-399-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of natural selection responsible for such local increase in order may be mathematically derived directly from the expression of the second law equation for connected non-equilibrium open systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.2008.0178 |title=Natural selection for least action |author1=Kaila, V. R.  |author2=Annila, A.|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A |date=8 November 2008 |volume=464 |issue=2099 |pages=3055–3070|bibcode = 2008RSPSA.464.3055K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entropy and the origin of life==
The second law of thermodynamics applied on the [[origin of life]] is a far more complicated issue than the further development of life, since there is no "standard model" of how the first biological lifeforms emerged; only a number of competing hypotheses. The problem is discussed within the area of [[abiogenesis]], implying gradual pre-Darwinian ''chemical evolution''. In 1924, [[Alexander Oparin]] suggested that sufficient energy was provided in a ''primordial soup''. The Belgian scientist [[Ilya Prigogine]] was awarded with a Nobel prize in 1977 for an analysis in this area. A related topic is the probability that life would emerge, which has been discussed in several studies, for example by [[Russell Doolittle]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell Doolittle, "The Probability and Origin of Life" in ''Scientists Confront Creationism'' (1984) Ed. Laurie R. Godfrey, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entropy and the search for life elsewhere in the Universe==
In 2013 Azua-Bustos and Vega argued that disregarding the type of lifeform that could be envisioned both on Earth and elsewhere in the Universe, all should share in common the attribute of being entities that decrease their internal entropy at the expense of free energy obtained from its surroundings. As entropy allows the quantification of the degree of disorder in a system, any envisioned lifeform must have a higher degree of order than its supporting environment. These authors showed that by using fractal mathematics analysis alone, they could readily quantify the degree of structural complexity difference (and thus entropy) of living processes as distinct entities separate from their similar abiotic surroundings. This approach may allow the future detection of unknown forms of life both in the Solar System and on recently discovered exoplanets based on nothing more than entropy differentials of complementary datasets (morphology, coloration, temperature, pH, isotopic composition, etc.).

==Entropy in psychology==

The notion of entropy as disorder has been transferred from thermodynamics to [[psychology]] by [[Poland|Polish]] [[psychiatrist]] [[Antoni Kępiński]], who admitted being inspired by [[Erwin Schrödinger]].&lt;ref name="kepinski1972c"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kępiński|first1=Antoni|title=Rhythm of life (in Polish)|date=1972|publisher=Wydawnictwo Literackie|location=Kraków}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his theoretical framework devised to explain [[mental disorder]]s (the [[information metabolism]] theory), the difference between living organisms and other systems was explained as the ability to maintain order. Contrary to inanimate matter, organisms maintain the particular order of their bodily structures and inner worlds which they impose onto their surroundings and forward to new generations. The life of an organism or the [[species]] ceases as soon as it loses that ability.&lt;ref name="pietrak2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pietrak|first1=Karol|title=The foundations of socionics - a review.|journal=Cognitive Systems Research|volume=47|year=2018|pages=1–11|doi=10.1016/J.COGSYS.2017.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining of that order requires continual exchange of information between the organism and its surroundings. In higher organisms, [[information]] is acquired mainly through [[Sensory neuron|receptors]] and metabolised in the [[nervous system]]. The result is action - some form of [[motion (physics)|motion]], for example [[animal locomotion|locomotion]], [[speech]], internal motion of organs, [[secretion]] of hormones etc. The reaction of organism becomes an informational signal to other organisms. [[Information metabolism]], which allows to maintain the order, is possible only if a hierarchy of value exists, as the signals coming to the organism must be structured. In humans that hierarchy has three levels i.e. biological, emotional and sociocultural.&lt;ref name="schochow2016"&gt; {{cite journal|last1=Schochow|first1=Maximilian|last2=Steger|first2=Florian|title=Antoni Kepiński (1918–1972), pioneer of post-traumatic stress disorder|journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry|volume=208|issue=6|year=2016|pages=590|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/antoni-kepinski-19181972-pioneer-of-posttraumatic-stress-disorder/CD3EE07A09F7EEABC49DE0D927804F6E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kępiński explained how various mental disorders are caused by distortions of that hierarchy and the return to mental health is possible through its restoration.&lt;ref name="bulaczek2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bulaczek|first1=Aleksandra|title=Relations patient – doctor in axiological psychiatry of Antoni Kępiński (in Polish)|journal=Studia Ecologiae et Bioethicae UKSW|date=2013|volume=11|issue=2|pages=9–28|url=http://cejsh.icm.edu.pl/cejsh/element/bwmeta1.element.desklight-37c5d3a1-9ee9-49e4-b9d1-287df1ef3a58/c/tom_11_2_1_aleksandra_bulaczek_relacje_pacjent_lekarz_w_psychiatrii_aksjologicznej_antoniego_kepinskiego.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The idea was continued by Struzik who proposed that Kępiński's information metabolism theory may be seen as an extension of [[Léon Brillouin|Brilluoin]]'s [[Negentropy#Brillouin's_negentropy_principle_of_information|negentropy principle of information]].&lt;ref name="struzik1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Struzik|first1=Tadeusz|title=Kepiński's Information Metabolism, Carnot's Principle and Information Theory|journal=International Journal of Neuroscience|date=1987|volume=36|issue=1-2|pages=105–111|doi=10.3109/00207458709002144}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the notion of ''psychological entropy'' has been reintroduced to psychologists by Hirsh et al.&lt;ref name="hirsh2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hirsh|first1=Jacob B.|last2=Mar|first2=Raymond A.|last3=Peterson|first3=Jordan B.|title=Psychological Entropy: A Framework for Understanding Uncertainty-Related Anxiety|journal=Psychological Review|date=2012|issue=Advance online publication|doi=10.1037/a0026767|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jordan_Peterson2/publication/221752816_Psychological_Entropy_A_Framework_for_Understanding_Uncertainty-Related_Anxiety/links/0912f50e6ba7e533b1000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simiraly to Kępiński, these authors noted that [[uncertainty]] management is a critical ability for any organism. Uncertainty, arising due to the conflict between competing [[perception|perceptual]] and [[behavior|behavioral]] [[affordance|affordances]], is experienced subjectively as [[anxiety]]. Hirsh and his collaborators proposed that both the perceptual and behavioral domains may be conceptualized as [[probability distribution|probability distributions]] and that the amount of uncertainty associated with a given perceptual or behavioral experience can be quantified in terms of [[Entropy (information theory)|Claude Shannon’s entropy formula]].

==Other terms==
For nearly a century and a half, beginning with Clausius' 1863 memoir "On the Concentration of Rays of Heat and Light, and on the Limits of its Action", much writing and research has been devoted to the relationship between thermodynamic entropy and the [[evolution]] of [[life]]. The argument that life feeds on negative entropy or [[negentropy]] was asserted by physicist [[Erwin Schrödinger]] in a 1944 book ''[[What is Life? (Schrödinger)|What is Life?]]''.  He posed, "How does the living organism avoid decay?" The obvious answer is: "By eating, drinking, breathing and (in the case of plants) assimilating." Recent writings have used the concept of [[Gibbs free energy]] to elaborate on this issue.&lt;ref name="Higgs.P"&gt;Higgs, P. G., &amp; Pudritz, R. E. (2009).

While energy from nutrients is necessary to sustain an organism's order, there is also the Schrödinger prescience: "An organism's astonishing gift of concentrating a stream of order on itself and thus escaping the decay into atomic chaos – of drinking orderliness from a suitable environment – seems to be connected with the presence of the aperiodic solids..."  We now know that the 'aperiodic' crystal is DNA and that the irregular arrangement is a form of information. "The DNA in the cell nucleus contains the master copy of the software, in duplicate.  This software seems to control by "specifying an algorithm, or set of instructions, for creating and maintaining the entire organism containing the cell."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, P. (2004). Biological Physics, Energy, Information, Life. W.H. Freeman and Company. {{ISBN|0-7167-4372-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA and other macromolecules determine an organism's life cycle: birth, growth, maturity, decline, and death.  Nutrition is necessary but not sufficient to account for growth in size as genetics is the governing factor.  At some point, organisms normally decline and die even while remaining in environments that contain sufficient nutrients to sustain life. The controlling factor must be internal and not nutrients or sunlight acting as causal exogenous variables.  Organisms inherit the ability to create unique and complex biological structures; it is unlikely for those capabilities to be reinvented or be taught each generation. Therefore, DNA must be operative as the prime cause in this characteristic as well.  Applying Boltzmann's perspective of the second law, the change of state from a more probable, less ordered and high entropy arrangement to one of less probability, more order, and lower entropy seen in biological ordering calls for a function like that known of DNA.  DNA's apparent information processing function provides a resolution of the paradox posed by life and the entropy requirement of the second law.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Jacob,  Understanding the Thermodynamics of Biological Order, The American Biology Teacher,  74, Number 1, January 2012, pp. 22–24&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, American biochemist [[Albert Lehninger]] argued that the "order" produced within cells as they grow and divide is more than compensated for by the "disorder" they create in their surroundings in the course of growth and division. "Living organisms preserve their internal order by taking from their surroundings [[thermodynamic free energy|free energy]], in the form of nutrients or sunlight, and returning to their surroundings an equal amount of energy as [[heat]] and entropy."&lt;ref name="Lehninger"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lehninger|first=Albert|title=Principles of Biochemistry, 2nd Ed.|publisher=Worth Publishers|year=1993|isbn=0-87901-711-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study titled "Natural selection for least action" published in the ''Proceedings of the Royal Society A.'', Ville Kaila and Arto Annila of the [[University of Helsinki]] describe how the second law of thermodynamics can be written as an equation of motion to describe evolution, showing how natural selection and the principle of least action can be connected by expressing natural selection in terms of chemical thermodynamics. In this view, evolution explores possible paths to level differences in energy densities and so increase entropy most rapidly. Thus, an organism serves as an energy transfer mechanism, and beneficial mutations allow successive organisms to transfer more energy within their environment.&lt;ref name="evo2lot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news137679868.html|title=Evolution as Described by the Second Law of Thermodynamics|author=Lisa Zyga|date=11 August 2008|publisher=Physorg.com|accessdate=2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objections ==
{{expand section|date=December 2015}}
Entropy is defined for equilibrium systems,&lt;ref&gt;Callen, Herbert B (1985). Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Statistical Thermodynamics. John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; so objections to the extension of the second law and entropy to biological systems, especially as it pertains to its use to support or discredit the theory of evolution, have been stated.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Naim, Arieh (2012). Entropy and the Second Law. World Scientific Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Live systems and indeed much of the systems and processes in the universe operate far from equilibrium, whereas the second law succinctly states that isolated systems evolve toward thermodynamic equilibrium — the state of maximum entropy.

However, entropy is well defined much more broadly based on the [[Entropy (information theory)|probabilities]] of a system's states, whether or not the system is a dynamical one (for which equilibrium could be relevant).  Even in those physical systems where equilibrium could be relevant, (1) live systems cannot persist in isolation and (2) the second principle of thermodynamics does not require that free energy be transformed into entropy along the shortest path: live organisms absorb energy from sunlight or from energy-rich chemical compounds and finally return part of such energy to the environment as entropy (heat and low free-energy compounds such as water and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

{{Tort law}}
'''''{{lang|la|Ex turpi causa non oritur actio}}''''' ([[Latin]] "from a dishonorable cause an action does not arise") is a [[legal doctrine]] which states that a [[plaintiff]] will be unable to pursue [[legal remedy]] if it arises in connection with his own illegal act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legal-glossary.org/ex-turpi-causa-non-oritur-actio/ |title=Legal Definition of Ex turpi causa non oritur actio |publisher=legal-glossary.org |date= |accessdate=2014-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly relevant in the law of [[contract]], [[tort]] and [[trusts]],&lt;ref&gt;Winfield &amp; Jolowicz on Tort, 15th edition, 866, suggest that the doctrine should be purely confined to contract&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{lang|la|ex turpi causa}}'' is also known as the '''illegality defence''', since a defendant may plead that even though, for instance, he broke a contract, conducted himself negligently or broke an equitable duty, nevertheless a claimant by reason of his own illegality cannot sue.
The UK Supreme Court provided a thorough reconsideration of the doctrine in 2016 in [[ Patel v Mirza]].&lt;ref&gt;[2016] UKSC 42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
In the early case of ''[[Holman v Johnson]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1775) 1 Cowp 341, 343&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Mansfield]] CJ set out the rationale for the illegality doctrine.

{{quote|The objection, that a contract is immoral or illegal as between plaintiff and defendant, sounds at all times very ill in the mouth of the defendant. It is not for his sake, however, that the objection is ever allowed; but it is founded in general principles of policy, which the defendant has the advantage of, contrary to the real justice, as between him and the plaintiff, by accident, if I may say so. The principle of public policy is this; ''{{lang|la|ex dolo malo non oritur actio}}'' ["no action arises from deceit"]. No court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action upon an immoral or an illegal act. If, from the plaintiff's own standing or otherwise, the cause of action appears to arise ''{{lang|la|ex turpi causa}}'' ["from an immoral cause"], or the transgression of a positive law of this country, there the court says he has no right to be assisted. It is upon that ground the court goes; not for the sake of the defendant, but because they will not lend their aid to such a plaintiff. So if the plaintiff and defendant were to change sides, and the defendant was to bring his action against the plaintiff, the latter would then have the advantage of it; for where both were equally in fault, ''{{lang|la|[[potior est conditio defendentis]]}}'' ["stronger is the position of the defendant"].}}

==English law==
{{main article|Illegality in English law}}

===Tort===
{{see also|English tort law}}
In the law of [[tort]], the principle would prevent a criminal from bringing a claim against (for example) a fellow criminal. In ''[[National Coal Board v England]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1954] AC 403&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyril Asquith, Baron Asquith of Bishopstone|Lord Asquith]] said,

{{quote|If two burglars, A and B, agree to open a safe by means of explosives, and A so negligently handles the explosive charge as to injure B, B might find some difficulty in maintaining an action for negligence against A.}}

In ''[[Hewison v Meridian Shipping Services Pte Ltd]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hewison v Meridian Shipping Services Pte Ltd]]'' [2002] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/1821.html EWCA Civ 1821]&lt;/ref&gt; an employee who had obtained his position by concealing his epilepsy was held not to be entitled to claim compensation for future loss of earnings as a result of his employer's negligence, since his deception (resulting in a pecuniary advantage contrary to the Theft Act 1968) would prevent him from obtaining similar employment in future.

It is not absolute in effect. For example, in ''[[Revill v Newbery]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1996] 1 All ER 291&lt;/ref&gt; an elderly [[allotment (gardening)|allotment]] holder was sleeping in his shed with a [[shotgun]], to deter [[burglar]]s.  On hearing the plaintiff trying to break in, he shot his gun through a hole in the shed, injuring the plaintiff.  At first instance, the judge awarded damages on the basis that the defendant had used violence in excess of the reasonable limits allowed by lawful self-defence and was negligent to the standard of care expected of a reasonable man who found himself in such a situation. On appeal the defendant raised the defence of ''{{lang|la|ex turpi causa}}'', but the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] held that while public interest required that someone should not benefit from his illegal conduct, different considerations applied in cases arising in tort as opposed to those in a property or contract context. Old common law authorities and the Law Commission report (Liability for Damage or Injury to Trespassers) acknowledged the existence of some duty towards trespassers and the defendant could not rely on the doctrine to relieve himself of liability.

The precise scope of the doctrine is not certain. In some cases, it seems that the illegality prevents a [[duty of care]] arising in the first place. For example, in ''[[Ashton v Turner]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1981] QB 137&lt;/ref&gt; the defendant injured the plaintiff by crashing the car they sat in together in the course of fleeing the scene of a burglary they had committed together. Ewbank J held that the court may not recognise a duty of care in such cases as a matter of [[public policy]]. Similarly, in ''[[Pitts v Hunt]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1990] 3 All ER 344&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal rationalised this approach, saying that it was impossible to decide the appropriate standard of care in cases where the parties were involved in illegality.

If the illegality vanishes by result of legislative action (such as if the law that made the act that caused the injury was a crime is repealed) or some subsequent court case (where the law is declared invalid), the tort action will stand. In the case of ''[[Martin v. Ziherl]]'', the two parties were [[girlfriend]] and [[boyfriend]] until Martin discovered Ziherl had given her herpes. Martin sued Ziherl for damages in Virginia Circuit Court, and Ziherl argued that because of the case of ''Zyzk v. Zysk'' since having sex with someone they were not married to was technically the crime of fornication, Martin could not sue Ziherl because she got herpes as result of the illegal act. Martin argued the act was unconstitutional. The court agreed with Ziherl and against Martin. Martin appealed, and the Supreme Court of Virginia reversed, agreeing with Martin's argument that because the United States Supreme Court had decided in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' that noncommercial, private intimacy was a protected right, the law making fornication a crime was unconstitutional, thus Martin could now sue since the law that made having sex with someone they were not married to was struck down as void.

===Trusts===
{{see also|English trusts law}}
In other cases, the courts view ''{{lang|la|ex turpi}}'' as a [[defense (legal)|defence]] where otherwise a claim would lie, again on grounds of public policy.  In ''[[Tinsley v Milligan]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1992] Ch 310&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Nicholls|Nicholls LJ]] in the Court of Appeal spoke of the court having to "weigh or balance the adverse consequences of granting relief against the adverse consequences of refusing relief". The plaintiff was ultimately successful in ''Tinsley v Milligan'' in the [[House of Lords]], which allowed the claim on the grounds that the plaintiff did not need to rely on the illegality.

A later case, ''[[Gray v Thames Trains]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2009] 3 WLR 167&lt;/ref&gt;, upheld the basic rule of public policy that disallowed recovery of anything stemming from Plaintiff's own wrongdoing. 

*''[[Moore Stephens v Stone Rolls Ltd]]'' [2009] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/39.html UKHL 39]

===Contract===
The doctrine in the aspect of contract essentially does the same thing as one of the vitiating contractual elements known as 'Illegality' .Here contractual remedies can not be enforced by a court on a defendant if it 
is manifest that the subject matter of the contract is in anyway whether directly or by implication, contrary to public policy or in contradiction with any existing law or custom.
{{see also|English contract law}}

==Major reconsideration of the doctrine by the Supreme Court==

In 2016 the Supreme Court provided a major reconsideration of this doctrine, in [[ Patel v Mirza]] &lt;ref&gt;[2016] UKSC 42&lt;/ref&gt;, over-ruling the test in [[Tinsley v Milligan]] and replacing it with a new set of principles. 
The changes were described as 'revolutionary' by a dissenting judge on the case, Lord Sumption (at [261] in the judgement).

{{Refimprove|date=September 2009}}
{{Writing systems sidebar}}
In a '''featural [[writing system]]''', the shapes of the symbols (such as letters) are not arbitrary but encode [[distinctive feature|phonological feature]]s of the phonemes that they represent.  The term '''featural''' was introduced by [[Geoffrey Sampson]] to describe the [[Hangul|Korean alphabet]]&lt;ref name="Sampson"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-8047-1756-4|title=Writing Systems|first=Geoffrey|last=Sampson|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1990|ref=Sampson}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|120}} and [[Pitman shorthand]].&lt;ref name="Sampson" /&gt;{{rp|40}}

Joe Martin introduced the term '''featural notation''' to describe writing systems that include symbols to represent individual features rather than phonemes. He asserts that "alphabets have no symbols for anything smaller than a [[phoneme]]".&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite thesis|url=http://www.signwriting.org/archive/docs1/sw0032-Stokoe-Sutton.pdf|title=A  Linguistic  Comparison:  Two  Notation  Systems  for  Signed  Languages|first=Joe|last=Martin|year=2000|ref=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

A ''featural'' script represents finer detail than an [[alphabet]]. Here symbols do not represent whole phonemes, but rather the elements (features) that make up the phonemes, such as [[voice (phonetics)|voicing]] or its [[place of articulation]]. Theoretically, each feature could be written with a separate letter; and [[abjad]]s or [[abugida]]s, or indeed [[syllabary|syllabaries]], could be featural, but the only prominent system of this sort is the Korean alphabet, also known as hangul or chosŏn'gŭl. In the Korean alphabet, the featural symbols are combined into alphabetic letters, and these letters are in turn joined into syllabic blocks, so that the system combines three levels of phonological representation.

Many scholars, e.g. [[John DeFrancis]], reject this class or at least labeling the Korean alphabet as such.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The Korean script is a conscious script creation by literate experts, which Daniels calls a "sophisticated [[grammatogeny]]".{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} These include [[stenography|stenographies]] and [[constructed script]]s of hobbyists and fiction writers (such as [[Tengwar]]), many of which feature advanced graphic designs corresponding to phonologic properties. The basic unit of writing in these systems can map to anything from phonemes to words. It has been shown that even the Latin script has sub-character "features".&lt;ref&gt;See {{citation |first=Beatrice |last=Primus |title=A featural analysis of the Modern Roman Alphabet |journal=Written Language and Literacy |volume=7 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=235–274 |url=http://idsl1.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/fileadmin/IDSLI/dozentenseiten/artikel_primus/Primus_Featural_Analysis_2004.pdf |accessdate=2015-12-05}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of featural systems==
This is a small list of examples of featural writing systems by date of creation. The languages for which each system was developed are also shown.

===15th century===
*'''[[Korean alphabet|Chosŏn'gŭl/Hangul]]''' — [[Korean language|Korean]]

===19th century===
*'''[[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]]''' — several [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]], [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo-Aleut]] and [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan]] languages 
*'''[[Gregg shorthand]]''' — many languages from different families
*'''[[Duployan shorthand]]''' — originally French, later English, German, Spanish, Romanian, [[Chinook Jargon]] and others
*'''[[Visible Speech]]''' (a phonetic script) — no specific language; developed to aid the deaf and teach them to speak properly

===20th century===
*'''[[Shavian alphabet]]''', '''[[Quikscript]]''' — English
*'''[[Tengwar]]''' (an artificial script invented by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]) — fictional languages from Tolkien's novels; English
*'''[[SignWriting]]''' —  sign languages; featural notation&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;{{rp|5}}
*'''[[Physioalphabet]]''' —  featural international phonetic alphabet based on and depicting the human physiology of speech production

===21st century===
*'''Isibheqe Sohlamvu/[[Ditema tsa Dinoko]]''' — [[Southern Bantu languages]]
&lt;!-- Please do not add these unless there is already a correspondent article or citation 
*'''[[Physioalphabet]]''' (an alphabet based on human physiology)
*'''[[SpeechWriting]]''' (Mundbildschrift: a script for writing mouth movements of voiced words)
*'''[[IsiBheqe SoHlamvu]]''' (an script for writing [[Southern Bantu languages]], also called ''Ditema tsa Dinoko'') --&gt;

==Semi-featural systems==
Other scripts may have limited featural elements. Many languages written in the [[Latin alphabet]] make use of [[diacritic]]s, and those letters using diacritics are sometimes considered separate letters within the language's alphabet. The [[Polish alphabet]], for example, indicates a [[Palatal consonant|palatal]] articulation of some consonants with an acute accent. The [[Turkish alphabet]] uses the presence of one or two dots above a vowel to indicate that it is a [[front vowel]]. The Japanese [[kana]] syllabaries indicate [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] consonants with marks known as [[dakuten]]. The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) also has some featural elements, for example in the hooks and tails that are characteristic of implosives, {{IPA|ɓ ɗ ʄ ɠ ʛ}}, and retroflex consonants, {{IPA|ʈ ɖ ʂ ʐ ɳ ɻ ɽ ɭ}}. The IPA [[diacritic]]s are also featural. The [[Fraser alphabet]] used for [[Lisu language|Lisu]] rotates the letters for the [[tenuis consonant]]s ꓑ {{IPA|/p/}}, ꓔ {{IPA|/t/}}, ꓝ {{IPA|/ts/}}, ꓚ {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, and ꓗ {{IPA|/k/}} 180° to indicate [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]].

Freedom of religion in [[Australia]] is allowed in practice and protected to varying degrees through the constitution and legislation at the [[Government of Australia|Federal]], [[States and territories of Australia|State and Territory]] level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Completed_Inquiries/jfadt/Religion/issues|title=Australia's Efforts to Promote and Protect Freedom of Religion and Belief|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/submissions/religious-freedom-review-2018|title=Religious Freedom Review (2018)|last=ahrc.admin|first=|date=2018-02-14|website=www.humanrights.gov.au|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia is a [[Secular state|secular country]] with legislated [[separation of church and state]] and with no [[state religion]]. The nation has over 13.5 million people who identify as religious and 7.1 million who identify as [[Irreligion in Australia|irreligious]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1266.02016?OpenDocument#Data|title=2016 Census - Cultural Diversity|last=Australian Bureau of Statistics|first=|date=|website=www.abs.gov.au|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relevant legislation protecting religious freedoms include sections of the [[Constitution of Australia]], Federal anti-[[discrimination]] laws and State/Territory-based human rights acts and anti-discrimination laws. As these freedoms are not protected in a single piece of legislation, but rather appear as sections, clauses and exemptions in other acts or laws, legal religious freedom protections are often a source of great debate and difficult to discern in Australia.

== Religious freedom laws ==

=== Federal level ===
The [[Constitution of Australia]] prohibits the Commonwealth from establishing laws which create, force or prohibit any religion. It also restricts the Commonwealth from using religion as a qualifier or test in order to hold public office. [[Section 116 of the Constitution of Australia|Section 116]] of ''Chapter V. The States'' in the [[Australian Constitution]] reads: &lt;blockquote&gt;''The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Constitution/chapter5|title=Chapter V. The States.|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The section is based on the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. The article does not prohibit the [[States and territories of Australia|States of Australia]] from implementing such laws, meaning legislation at the state level could provide for restriction or enforcement of religion.

=== State and Territory level ===
Two [[referendum]]s were held on whether to restrict the ability of states to legislate laws that may impede religious freedoms: the [[Australian Post-War Reconstruction and Democratic Rights referendum, 1944]] and [[Australian referendum, 1988]]. Both failed to achieve a majority of support amongst the states and therefore did not pass into law. In theory, Australian State and Territory Governments can therefore pass laws impeding religious freedoms.

Some states and territories have implemented a bill or charter of rights which include freedom and protection for religion, such as ''Section 14: Freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief'' in:

* ''[[Human Rights Act 2004]]'' ([[Australian Capital Territory]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www6.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdb/au/legis/act/consol_act/hra2004148/|title=HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 2004|website=www6.austlii.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities|''Charter of Human Rights &amp; Responsibilities Act 2006'']] ([[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www6.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdb/au/legis/vic/consol_act/cohrara2006433/|title=CHARTER OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES ACT 2006|website=www6.austlii.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These legislated acts are based on the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], to which Australia was a signatory in 1966 despite no direct legislation to permit these freedoms. These acts do not prevent the passing of laws that impede any rights mentioned (including religious freedoms), but they do create a process by which all legislation must be scrutinised for human rights implications, and must be accompanied by a statement of compatibility with human rights before they can be passed by the relevant Parliament. In cases where the legislation is not compatible, it may still be passed despite contradicting these human rights acts.

== Anti-discrimination laws ==
Anti-discrimination laws addressing unfair treatment on the basis of a range of attributes, including religion, also apply at the state and federal level. These laws contribute to religious freedoms by allowing Australians to practice religion without fear of consequence from the executive, organisations or individuals. This is achieved by prohibiting detrimental treatment as a result of an individual's religious appearance, beliefs or observances. Some argue these laws are inconsistent at the state level and may be limited at the federal level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Federal level ===
The ''[[Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986]]'' defines discrimination as:&lt;blockquote&gt;''(a)  any distinction, exclusion or preference made on the basis of race, colour, sex, '''religion''', political opinion, national extraction or social origin that has the effect of nullifying or impairing equality of opportunity or treatment in employment or occupation;''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017C00143|title=Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986|last=AG|website=www.legislation.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== State and Territory level ===
State and Territory legislation prohibits unfavourable treatment on the basis of an individual's personal characteristics, but to varying degrees and with varying detail.

Personal characteristics includes religious beliefs or activities in anti-discrimination legislation for the majority of states, and as such these laws may be seen to support religious freedom by prohibiting unfair treatment using religion as a basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/act/religious-freedom-should-be-protected-for-all-australians-20180519-p4zgc7.html|title=Religious freedom should be protected for all Australians|website=Canberra Times|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, anti-discrimination acts States where religious beliefs and activities are protected include:

*''Equal Opportunity Act 1984'' ([[Western Australia]])
*''Discrimination Act 1991'' (Australian Capital Territory)
*''[[Anti-Discrimination Act 1991]]'' ([[Queensland]])
*''Anti-Discrimination Act 1996'' ([[Northern Territory]])
*''Anti-Discrimination Act 1998'' ([[Tasmania]])
*''[[Equal Opportunity Act 2010]]'' (Victoria)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/employers/good-practice-good-business-factsheets/quick-guide-australian-discrimination-laws|title=A quick guide to Australian discrimination laws|last=Kwan|first=Connie|date=2015-02-11|website=www.humanrights.gov.au|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other state acts apply narrower protection to '[[Religious clothing|religious appearance or dress]]' (''Equal Opportunity Act 1984'', [[South Australia]]) and '[[Ethnoreligious group|Ethno-religious]] or [[Nationality|national origin]]' (''[[Anti-Discrimination Act 1977]]'', [[New South Wales]]). It has been suggested that both states update their laws in order to align to the rest of the States and Territories.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vac.org.au/site/assets/uploaded/9dcc87b5-vac_religious_freedom_review_final.pdf|title=Submission to the Religious Freedom Review|last=Victorian Aids Council|first=|date=|website=vac.org.au|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious exemptions ===
General religious exception or exemption clauses exist within the various federal and state human rights acts with the aim to ensuring religious activities or observances are not impacted or inhibited by the protections provided by each act. These exemptions therefore protect freedom of religion by permitting what would otherwise be considered discrimination if it is in the context of "an act or practice of a body established for religious purposes that conforms to the doctrines, tenets or beliefs of that religion or is necessary to avoid injury to the religious sensitivities of adherents of that religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/FOI/Documents/Commonwealth%20Anti-Discrimination%20Legislation.pdf|title=List of Exemptions in Commonwealth Anti-Discrimination Legislation|last=|first=|date=|website=Attorney General of Australia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the ''Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986'', for example, an exemption is provided:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Discrimination ... does not include any distinction, exclusion or preference:''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; ''(d)  in connection with employment as a member of the staff of an institution that is conducted in accordance with the doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teachings of a particular religion or creed, being a distinction, exclusion or preference made in good faith '''in order to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents of that religion or that creed.'''''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Varying groups have argued that existing religious exceptions and exemptions go too far and impede the rights of individuals,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/yes-victors-seek-abolition-of-all-church-exemptions-to-anti-discrimination-laws-20180214-p4z0aj.html|title='Yes' victors seek abolition of all church exemptions to anti-discrimination laws|last=Koziol|first=Michael|date=2018-02-14|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst others argue the correct balance has been struck,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/07/labor-has-no-plans-to-change-law-allowing-religious-schools-to-fire-gay-teachers|title=Labor has 'no plans' to change law allowing religious schools to fire gay teachers|last=Karp|first=Paul|date=2018-01-07|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and yet others petition for wider-reaching religious exemption clauses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.acl.org.au/acl-contributes-to-the-australian-human-rights-commissions-religious-freedom-roundtable|title=ACL contributes to the Australian Human Rights Commission’s Religious Freedom Roundtable|work=Australian Christian Lobby|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judgements and interpretations ==
{{See also|Section 116 of the Constitution of Australia}}
[[File:Court 2 at the High Court of Australia.jpg|thumb|Court 2 of the High Court of Australia, [[Canberra]]. The High Court has issued few judgements in direct relation to freedom of religion]]
There have been few tests involving religious freedom put before the [[High Court of Australia]]. Judgements from the Court are generally considered to interpret the primary piece of legislation relating to religious freedom, Section 116, narrowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Treading on Sacred Grounds: Places of Worship, Local Planning and Religious Freedom in Australia|last=Villaroman|first=Noel|publisher=Brill Nijhoff|year=2015|isbn=978-90-04-28933-8|edition=12|location=Boston|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Church of the New Faith v Commissioner for Pay-Roll Tax (Vic) ===
In the 1983 judgment of the High Court in ''Church of the New Faith v Commissioner for Pay-Roll Tax (Vic)'', the court was primarily concerned with whether [[Scientology]] was a religion (and therefore deserved [[tax exemption]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t status). In judgement, the Court found that [[Scientology]] was a religion and argued that the definition of religion must be flexible, but also remain sceptical of false claims. Justices [[Ronald Wilson]] and [[William Deane]] set out five "[[wikt:indicia|indicia]]" of a religion:&lt;blockquote&gt;(i) That the collection of ideas and practices involved a belief in the supernatural (being something that could not be perceived by the senses); (ii) That 'the ideas relate to man's nature and place in the universe and his relation to things supernatural' ; (iii) That the adherents accept certain ideas as requiring them or encouraging them to observe particular codes of conduct or specific practices having some supernatural significance; (iv) The adherents themselves form an identifiable group or groups; (v) The adherents themselves see the collection of ideas, beliefs and practices as constituting a religion.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jade.io/article/67076|title=CHURCH OF THE NEW FAITH v. COMMISSIONER OF PAY-ROLL TAX (VICT.) 1983, 154 CLR 120|last=HIGH COURT OF AUSTRALIA|first=|date=27 October 1983|website=Jade|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In this judgement Section 116 was interpreted more broadly than in previous cases. The justices argued that Section 116 provides fundamental guarantees to freedom of religion:&lt;blockquote&gt;The development of the law towards complete religious liberty and religious equality... would be subverted and the guarantees in s. 116 of the Constitution would lose their character as a bastion of freedom if religion were so defined as to exclude from its ambit minority religions out of the main streams of religious thought.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Adelaide Co of Jehovah's Witnesses Inc v Commonwealth ===
{{See also|Adelaide Co of Jehovah's Witnesses Inc v Commonwealth}}
In the 1941 the Commonwealth Government declared [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] to be a risk to national security, indicating they were believed to be "prejudicial to the defence of the Commonwealth" and the "efficient prosecution of the [[World War II|war]]" due to their following ideals of another Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/legislating-religious-freedom-will-be-a-minefield-for-morrison-20181002-p50798.html|title=Legislating religious freedom will be a minefield for Morrison|last=Hull|first=Crispin|date=2018-10-05|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police occupied premises of the religious group, prompting a lawsuit heard by the High Court in which Jehovah's Witnesses argued their rights granted under Section 116 of the Constitution were infringed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lawandreligionaustralia.blog/tag/jehovahs-witness-case/|title=Jehovah’s Witness case – Law and Religion Australia|website=lawandreligionaustralia.blog|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court held that the ''National Security (Subversive Organisations) Regulations'' 1940, under which the Government had taken action, did not infringe against Section 116, but that the government had exceeded their "defence power" in [[Section 51(vi) of the Australian Constitution|section 51(vi)]] of the Constitution. Jehovah's Witnesses have since continued to practice in Australia unabated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McLeish|first=Stephen|date=1992|title=MAKING SENSE OF RELIGION AND THE CONSTITUTION: A FRESH START FOR SECTION 116|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MonashULawRw/1992/10.pdf|journal=Monash University Law Review|volume=|pages=207-236|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and status quo ==

The absence of a Federal [[Bill of rights|Bill of Rights]] (or Human Rights Act) which provide a guarantee of religious and other freedoms in almost all other western democracies, has been noted as a primary failure to solidify the current ''de facto'' and ''de jure'' rights to freedom of religion in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/comment-australia-needs-a-bill-of-rights|title=Comment: Australia needs a Bill of Rights|work=SBS News|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Human Rights Commission]] has criticised the lack of protections for religious freedom alongside other ''de facto'' freedoms and has recommended the introduction of a Bill of Rights to formally protect the rights of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/freedom-thought-conscience-and-religion-or-belief|title=Freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief|last=David.Mason|date=2013-05-01|website=www.humanrights.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have highlighted that religion and religious freedoms are already well-protected, including with exemptions to anti-discrimination legislation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Frequently highlighted examples include [[religious school]]s having rights not extended to other institutions, including the ability to fire teachers who do not align with the institution's religious beliefs for any reason. This occurred in the case of the Perth South Coast Baptist College and teacher Craig Campbell who was sacked for coming out as homosexual in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news.com.au/national/western-australia/mocked-in-class-this-teacher-revealed-he-was-gay-he-lost-his-job/news-story/c1209c28127019613da5cc7ddfe4d700|title=Perth teacher loses his job after telling school he is gay|work=NewsComAu|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ruddock Review ==
[[File:Philip Ruddock.jpg|left|thumb|Philip Ruddock, chair of the Religious Freedom Review]]

=== Report commission ===
Following the passage of [[same-sex marriage]] [[Same-sex marriage in Australia|legislation in Australia]] in 2017, a federal review was commissioned by the [[Second Turnbull Ministry|Turnbull Government]] to examine the suitability of current religious freedom protections, specifically within the context of the new [[Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pmc.gov.au/domestic-policy/religious-freedom-review|title=Religious Freedom Review|last=Cabinet|first=Prime Minister and|date=2017-12-12|website=www.pmc.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Religious Freedom Review was chaired by [[Philip Ruddock]], the former [[Attorney-General for Australia]] at the time same-sex marriage was [[Marriage Amendment Act 2004|banned]] by the [[Third Howard Ministry|Howard Government]] in 2004, and had no associated terms of reference.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/act/ruddock-review-next-big-battle-for-gay-community-lgbtiq-council-chair-says-20171208-h01e6t.html|title=Ruddock review next big battle for gay community, LGBTIQ council chair says|last=Burgess|first=Katie|website=Canberra Times|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The review panel was composed of Ruddock alongside [[Jesuit]] priest [[Frank Brennan (priest)|Frank Brennan]], former judge [[Annabelle Bennett]], Human Rights Commission president [[Ros Croucher]] and constitutional lawyer Nicholas Aroney. The expert review panel first met on 10 January 2018, and on 18 May the final review was handed to the Turnbull Government. The Government has declined to release the review in full pending cabinet discussion on its recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://junkee.com/ruddock-religious-freedom-review/159126|title=The Government Has Received The "Religious Freedom" Report, But We Can't See It|date=2018-05-18|work=Junkee|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ruddock review has been interpreted as a way to allow the speedy passage of Dean Smith's marriage bill and to postpone discussions of religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Koziol|first1=Michael|title=Philip Ruddock review into religious freedom fails to deter conservative MPs from attack on marriage bill|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/philip-ruddock-review-into-religious-freedom-fails-to-deter-conservative-mps-from-attack-on-marriage-bill-20171122-gzqbt2.html|accessdate=11 March 2018|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=22 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the Ruddock Review argue it is necessary to ensure that religious freedoms are upheld in the wake of religious objection to same-sex marriage, whilst opponents highlight that further protections for religion are not necessary and will occur at the expense of an individual's right to be free from discrimination (particularly in the case of same-sex marriages).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/don-t-change-discrimination-laws-architect-tells-religious-freedom-review-20180330-p4z74c.html|title=Don't change discrimination laws, architect tells religious freedom review|last=Koziol|first=Michael|date=2018-03-30|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups such as the [[Victorian Aids Council]] and Australian Human Rights Commission have argued that a comprehensive Bill of Rights -rather than an exclusive religious freedoms law- should be implemented as this would also give full effect to Australia's obligations and commitments under the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] by enshrining all fundamental rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Government response ===
Turnbull's government indicated it would not release the report received in May 2018 until it had been considered in full by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://junkee.com/ruddock-religious-freedom-review/159126|title=The Government Has Received The "Religious Freedom" Report, But We Can't See It|date=2018-05-18|work=Junkee|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the deposition of Malcolm Turnbull as Prime Minister, his replacement [[Scott Morrison]] indicated his government would not release the report or form a full response to it before the end of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/11/morrison-eyes-law-to-protect-religion-as-greens-call-for-exemption-rollback|title=Morrison eyes law to protect religion as Greens call for exemption rollback|last=Karp|first=Paul|date=2018-10-11|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This drew criticism from [[Michael Kirby (judge)|Michael Kirby]] and [[Kerryn Phelps]] given the timing of the [[Wentworth by-election, 2018|Wentworth by-election]], as voters would not have an understanding of any changes to religious law potentially instituted by Australia's first [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/04/michael-kirby-attacks-coalition-for-failure-to-release-ruddock-religious-freedom-report|title=Michael Kirby attacks Coalition for failure to release Ruddock religious freedom report|last=Karp|first=Paul|date=2018-10-04|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/26/kerryn-phelps-urges-pm-to-release-ruddock-religious-freedom-review-before-byelection|title=Kerryn Phelps urges PM to release Ruddock religious freedom review before byelection|last=Murphy|first=Katharine|date=2018-09-25|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite a senate motion ordering its release ahead of the by-election, the government refused to comply, claiming that a release would "harm the public interest" and interfere in cabinet consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/release-religious-freedom-report-senators|title=Release religious freedom report: senators|work=SBS News|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.outinperth.com/morrison-government-refuses-release-religious-freedom-report/|title=Morrison government refuses to release religious freedom report {{!}} OUTInPerth – LGBTIQ News and Culture|website=www.outinperth.com|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister [[Scott Morrison]] suggested in an [[ABC Radio National|ABC Radio]] interview that the Ruddock review had recommended that people of different religions have the same protections as other attributes such as gender and race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/11/morrison-eyes-law-to-protect-religion-as-greens-call-for-exemption-rollback|title=Morrison eyes law to protect religion as Greens call for exemption rollback|last=Karp|first=Paul|date=2018-10-11|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leaks and media coverage ===
On 9 October 2018, extracts of the review were leaked to [[Fairfax Media]], which reported that schools affiliated with a religion "would be guaranteed the right to turn away gay students and teachers under changes to federal anti-discrimination laws" recommended by the review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Topsfield |first1=Jewel |title=Religious freedom review enshrines right of schools to turn away gay children and teachers |url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/religious-freedom-review-enshrines-right-of-schools-to-turn-away-gay-children-and-teachers-20181009-p508o7.html |accessdate=12 October 2018 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=9 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister initially defended this, but stated that the media coverage of the leaked report was "confused".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/10/gay-students-could-be-rejected-by-religious-schools-under-new-laws-report-claims|title=Gay students could be rejected by religious schools under new laws, report claims|last1=Karp|first1=Paul|date=9 October 2018|work=the Guardian|accessdate=12 October 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious schools have held the right to discriminate against teachers and students on the basis of their gender or sexual orientation since 2013, however the Ruddock report recommended that schools additionally be required to hold a publicly-available policy and put the best interests of the child first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/ruddock-report-constrains-not-expands-federal-religious-exemptions-96347|title=Ruddock report constrains, not expands, federal religious exemptions|last1=Elphick|first1=Liam|last2=Maguire|first2=Amy|date=11 October 2018|website=The Conversation|language=en|accessdate=12 October 2018|last3=Hilkemeijer|first3=Anja}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following further media coverage and public pressure, the Labor opposition announced their support would be lent to the government should it seek to repeal the discrimination law exemptions already in existence which allow religious schools to ban students based on their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/12/labor-offers-support-if-morrison-acts-to-stop-schools-from-expelling-gay-students|title=Labor offers support if Morrison acts to stop schools from expelling gay students|last=Karp|first=Paul|date=2018-10-12|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Morrison Government]] subsequently agreed to introduce a bill to parliament with that aim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/13/morrison-caves-to-labor-on-gay-students-in-discrimination-law-reform-push|title=Scott Morrison will change the law to ban religious schools expelling gay students|last=Karp|first=Paul|date=2018-10-12|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/bipartisan-backflip-on-queer-bigotry-20181013-p509hr.html|title=Bipartisan backflip on queer bigotry|date=2018-10-13|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Greens]] and Labor opposition have further committed to revoking discrimination exemptions that also allow discrimination against teachers based on their sexual orientation, however the government has so far not indicated its position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/protect-gay-teachers-now-labor|title=Protect gay teachers now: Labor|work=SBS News|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[orbital mechanics]], a '''frozen orbit''' is an [[orbit]] for an artificial [[satellite]] in which natural drifting due to the [[central body]]'s shape has been minimized by careful selection of the [[orbital parameters]]. Typically, this is an orbit in which, over a long period of time, the satellite's [[altitude]] remains constant at the same point in each orbit.&lt;ref name=cdeagle&gt;{{cite web|last=Eagle |first=C.

==Background and motivation==
For most spacecraft, changes to orbits are caused by the [[Geopotential model|oblateness of the Earth]], gravitational attraction from the sun and moon, [[solar radiation pressure]], and [[air drag]]. These are called "perturbing forces". They must be counteracted by maneuvers to keep the spacecraft in the desired orbit. For a [[Geostationary orbit|geostationary spacecraft]], correction maneuvers on the order of 40–50&amp;nbsp;m/s per year are required to counteract the gravitational forces from the sun and moon which move the orbital plane away from the equatorial plane of the Earth.

For [[Sun-synchronous orbit|sun-synchronous spacecraft]], intentional shifting of the orbit plane (called "precession") can be used for the benefit of the mission. For these missions, a near-circular orbit with an altitude of 600–900&amp;nbsp;km is used. An appropriate inclination (97.8-99.0 degrees) is selected so that the precession of the orbital plane is equal to the rate of movement of the Earth around the sun, about 1 degree per day.

As a result, the spacecraft will pass over points on the Earth that have the same time of day during every orbit. For instance, if the orbit is "square to the sun", the vehicle will always pass over points at which it is 6 a.m. on the north-bound portion, and 6 p.m. on the south-bound portion (or vice versa). This is called a "Dawn-Dusk" orbit. Alternatively, if the sun lies in the orbital plane, the vehicle will always pass over places where it is midday on the north-bound leg, and places where it is midnight on the south-bound leg (or vice versa). These are called "Noon-Midnight" orbits. Such orbits are desirable for many Earth observation missions such as weather, imagery, and mapping.

The perturbing force caused by the oblateness of the Earth will in general perturb not only the orbital plane but also the [[eccentricity vector]] of the orbit. There exists, however, an almost-circular orbit for which there are no secular/long periodic perturbations of the eccentricity vector, only periodic perturbations with period equal to the orbital period.  Such an orbit is then perfectly periodic (except for the orbital plane precession) and it is therefore called a "frozen orbit". Such an orbit is often the preferred choice for an Earth observation mission where repeated observations of the same area of the Earth should be made under as constant observation conditions as possible.

The [[Earth observation satellite]]s [[European Remote-Sensing Satellite|ERS-1, ERS-2]] and [[Envisat]] are operated in sun-synchronous frozen orbits.

===Lunar frozen orbits===
Through a study of many [[lunar orbit]]ing satellites, scientists have discovered that most [[Lunar orbit|low lunar orbit]]s (LLO) are unstable.&lt;ref name=Elipe2003&gt;[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/2.5064?journalCode=jgcd Frozen Orbits About the Moon. 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; Four ''frozen lunar orbits'' have been identified at 27°, 50°, 76°, and 86° inclination. NASA expounded on this in 2006:&lt;ref name=nasa20061106&gt;{{cite web |title=Bizarre Lunar Orbits |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2006/06nov_loworbit/ |last=Bell |first=Trudy E. |date=November 6, 2006 |editor-last=Phillips |editor-first=Tony |work=Science@NASA |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Mass concentration (astronomy)|Lunar mascons]] make most low lunar orbits unstable ... As a satellite passes 50 or 60 miles overhead, the mascons pull it forward, back, left, right, or down, the exact direction and magnitude of the tugging depends on the satellite's trajectory. Absent any periodic boosts from onboard rockets to correct the orbit, most satellites released into low lunar orbits (under about 60 miles or 100 km) will eventually crash into the Moon. ... [There are] a number of 'frozen orbits' where a spacecraft can stay in a low lunar orbit indefinitely. They occur at four inclinations: 27°, 50°, 76°, and 86°"—the last one being nearly over the lunar poles. The orbit of the relatively long-lived Apollo 15 subsatellite [[PFS-1]] had an inclination of 28°, which turned out to be close to the inclination of one of the frozen orbits—but poor [[PFS-2]] was cursed with an inclination of only 11°.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Classical theory==
{{cleanup

The classical theory of frozen orbits is essentially based on the analytical [[Orbital perturbation analysis|perturbation analysis]] for artificial satellites of [[Dirk Brouwer]] made under contract with [[NASA]] and published in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Dirk Brouwer: "Solution of the Problem of the Artificial Satellite Without Drag", ''Astronomical Journal'', 64 (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

This analysis can be carried out as follows:

In the article [[orbital perturbation analysis]] the secular perturbation of the orbital pole &lt;math&gt;\Delta \hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt; from the &lt;math&gt;J_2\,&lt;/math&gt; term of the [[geopotential model]] is shown to be
: {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \hat{z}\ =\ -2\pi\ \frac{J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos i\ \sin i \quad \hat{g}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

which can be expressed in terms of orbital elements thusly:

:    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta i\ =\ 0
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
:    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \Omega\ =\ -2\pi\ \frac{J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos i
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

Making a similar analysis for the &lt;math&gt;J_3\,&lt;/math&gt; term (corresponding to the fact that the earth is [[Figure of the Earth|slightly pear shaped]]), one gets
:   {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \hat{z}\ =\ 2\pi\ \frac{J_3}{\mu\ p^3}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos i\ \left(\ e_h\ \left(1 - \frac{15}{4}\ \sin^2 i\right)\ \hat{g}\ -\ e_g\ \left(1 - \frac{5}{4}\ \sin^2 i\right)\ \hat{h}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

which can be expressed in terms of orbital elements as

:    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta i\ =\ -2\pi\ \frac{J_3}{\mu\ p^3}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos i\ e_g\ \left(1 - \frac{5}{4}\ \sin^2 i\right)
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}
:    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \Omega\ =\ 2\pi\ \frac{J_3}{\mu\ p^3}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \frac{\cos i}{\sin i}\ \ e_h\ \left(1 - \frac{15}{4}\ \sin^2 i\right)
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

In the same article the secular perturbation of the components of the [[Kepler orbit|eccentricity vector]] caused by the &lt;math&gt;J_2\,&lt;/math&gt; is shown to be:

:    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  \left(\Delta e_g, \Delta e_h\right)\ =\ 
    &amp; -2\pi\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2} \left(\frac{3}{2}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right)\ (-e_h ,e_g)\ + \ 2\pi\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos^2 i \left(-e_h, e_g\right)\ = \\
    &amp; -2\pi\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ 3 \left(\frac{5}{4}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right)\ \left(-e_h, e_g\right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

where:

* The first term is the in-plane perturbation of the eccentricity vector caused by the in-plane component of the perturbing force
* The second term is the effect of the new position of the ascending node in the new orbital plane, the orbital plane being perturbed by the out-of-plane force component

Making the analysis for the &lt;math&gt;J_3\,&lt;/math&gt; term one gets for the first term, i.e. for the perturbation of the eccentricity vector from the in-plane force component

:  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
2\pi\ \frac{J_3}{\mu\ p^3}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \sin i\ \left(\frac{5}{4}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right) 
\left(\left(1 - {e_g}^2 + 4\ {e_h}^2\right)\ \hat{g}\ -\ 5\ e_g\ e_h\ \hat{h}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|8}}}}

For inclinations in the range 97.8–99.0 deg, the &lt;math&gt;\Delta\Omega\,&lt;/math&gt; value given by ({{EquationNote|6}}) is much smaller than the value given by ({{EquationNote|3}}) and can be ignored. Similarly the quadratic terms of the eccentricity vector components in ({{EquationNote|8}}) can be ignored for almost circular orbits, i.e. ({{EquationNote|8}}) can be approximated with

:  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
2\pi\ \frac{J_3}{\mu\ p^3}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \sin i\ \left(\frac{5}{4}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right) \ \hat{g}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|9}}}}

Adding the &lt;math&gt;J_3\,&lt;/math&gt; contribution 
&lt;math&gt;
2\pi\ \frac{J_3}{\mu\ p^3}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \sin i\ \left(\frac{5}{4}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right) \ (1,\ 0)
&lt;/math&gt;

to ({{EquationNote|7}}) one gets
:    {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\left(\Delta e_g, \Delta e_h\right)\ =\ -2\pi\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ 3 \left(\frac{5}{4}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right)\ \left(-\left(e_h+\frac{J_3\ \sin i}{J_2\ 2\ p}\right),\ e_g \right) 
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|10}}}}

Now the difference equation shows that the eccentricity vector will describe a circle centered at the point &lt;math&gt;\left(\ 0,\ -\frac{J_3\ \sin i}{J_2\ 2\ p}\ \right)\,&lt;/math&gt;; the polar argument of the eccentricity vector increases with &lt;math&gt; -2\pi\ \frac {J_2}{\mu\ p^2}\ 3 \left(\frac{5}{4}\ \sin^2 i\ -\ 1\right)\,&lt;/math&gt; radians between consecutive orbits.

As
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = 398600.440\text{ km}^3/s^2 \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J_2 = 1.7555\ 10^{10}\text{ km}^5/s^2 \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J_3 = -2.619\ 10^{11}\text{ km}^6/s^2 \, &lt;/math&gt;

one gets for a polar orbit (&lt;math&gt; i = 90^\circ\,&lt;/math&gt;) with &lt;math&gt; p = 7200\text{ km}\,&lt;/math&gt; that the centre of the circle is at &lt;math&gt;(0,\ 0.001036)\,&lt;/math&gt; and the change of polar argument is 0.00400 radians per orbit.

The latter figure means that the eccentricity vector will have described a full circle in 1569 orbits.
Selecting the initial mean eccentricity vector as &lt;math&gt; (0,\ 0.001036)\,&lt;/math&gt; the mean eccentricity vector will stay constant for successive orbits, i.e. the orbit is frozen because the secular perturbations of the &lt;math&gt;J_2\,&lt;/math&gt; term given by ({{EquationNote|7}}) and of the &lt;math&gt;J_3\,&lt;/math&gt; term given by ({{EquationNote|9}}) cancel out.

In terms of classical orbital elements, this means that a frozen orbit should have the following (mean!) elements:
:&lt;math&gt;e = -\frac{J_3\ \sin i}{J_2\ 2\ p}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega =\ 90^\circ\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Modern theory==
The modern theory of frozen orbits is based on the algorithm given in a 1989 article by Mats Rosengren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |bibcode=1989ommd.proc...49R |author=Mats Rosengren |title=Improved technique for Passive Eccentricity Control (AAS 89-155) |volume=69 |publisher=AAS/NASA |book-title=Advances in the Astronautical Sciences|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For this the analytical expression ({{EquationNote|7}}) is used to iteratively update the initial (mean) eccentricity vector to obtain that the (mean) eccentricity vector several orbits later computed by the precise numerical propagation takes precisely the same value. In this way the secular perturbation of the eccentricity vector caused by the &lt;math&gt;J_2\,&lt;/math&gt; term is used to counteract all secular perturbations, not only those (dominating) caused by the &lt;math&gt;J_3\,&lt;/math&gt; term. One such additional secular perturbation that in this way can be compensated for is the one caused by the [[solar radiation pressure]], this perturbation is discussed in the article "[[Orbital perturbation analysis (spacecraft)]]".

Applying this algorithm for the case discussed above, i.e. a polar orbit (&lt;math&gt; i=90^\circ\,&lt;/math&gt;) with &lt;math&gt; p=7200\text{ km}\,&lt;/math&gt; ignoring all perturbing forces other than the &lt;math&gt;J_2\,&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;J_3\,&lt;/math&gt; forces for the numerical propagation one gets exactly the same optimal average eccentricity vector as with the "classical theory", i.e. &lt;math&gt; (0,\ 0.001036)\,&lt;/math&gt;.

When we also include the forces due to the higher zonal terms the optimal value changes to &lt;math&gt; (0,\ 0.001285)\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Assuming in addition a reasonable solar pressure (a "cross-sectional-area" of {{nowrap|0.05 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/kg}}, the direction to the sun in the direction towards the ascending node) the optimal value for the average eccentricity vector becomes &lt;math&gt; (0.000069,\ 0.001285)\,&lt;/math&gt; which corresponds to :&lt;math&gt;\omega =\ 87^\circ\,&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the optimal value is '''not''' &lt;math&gt;\omega =\ 90^\circ&lt;/math&gt; anymore.

This algorithm is implemented in the orbit control software used for the [[Earth observation satellite]]s [[European Remote-Sensing Satellite|ERS-1, ERS-2]] and [[Envisat]]

==Derivation of the closed form expressions for the ''J''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perturbation==
{{cleanup
 |1=section
 |reason=[[Wikipedia:NOTTEXTBOOK|Wikipedia Is Not A Textbook]]. The provided derivation is lacking context for why it would be useful to readers.
|date=September 2013}}

The main perturbing force to be counter-acted to have a frozen orbit is the "&lt;math&gt;J_3\,&lt;/math&gt; force", i.e. the gravitational force caused by an imperfect symmetry north/south of the Earth, and the "classical theory" is based on the closed form expression for this "&lt;math&gt;J_3\,&lt;/math&gt; perturbation".  With the "modern theory" this explicit closed form expression is not directly used but it is certainly still worthwhile to derive it.

The derivation of this expression can be done as follows:

The potential from a zonal term is rotational symmetric around the  polar axis of the Earth and corresponding force is entirely in a longitudial plane with one component &lt;math&gt;F_r\ \hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; in the radial direction and one component &lt;math&gt;F_\lambda\ \hat{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt;  with the unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt; orthogonal to the radial direction towards north. These directions &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt; are illustrated in Figure 1.

[[File:Spherical coordinates unit vectors.svg|thumb|right|Figure 1: The unit vectors &lt;math&gt;\hat{\phi},\ \hat{\lambda},\ \hat{r}&lt;/math&gt;]]

In the article [[Geopotential model]] it is shown that these force components caused by the &lt;math&gt;J_3\,&lt;/math&gt; term are

:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;F_r = J_3\ \frac{1}{r^5}\ 2\ \sin\lambda\ \left(5\sin^2\lambda\ -\ 3\right) \\
&amp;F_\lambda = -J_3\ \frac{1}{r^5}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos\lambda\ \left(5\ \sin^2\lambda\ -1\right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|11}}}}

To be able to apply relations derived in the article [[Orbital perturbation analysis (spacecraft)]] the force component &lt;math&gt;F_\lambda\ \hat{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt; must be split into two orthogonal components &lt;math&gt;F_t\ \hat{t}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_z\ \hat{z}&lt;/math&gt; as illustrated in figure 2

[[File:Zonal term force components.svg|thumb|right|Figure 2: The unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{t}\,&lt;/math&gt; orthogonal to &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; in the direction of motion and the orbital pole &lt;math&gt;\hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt;. The force component &lt;math&gt;F_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is marked as "F"]]
Let &lt;math&gt;\hat{a},\ \hat{b},\ \hat{n}\,&lt;/math&gt; make up a rectangular coordinate system with origin in the center of the Earth (in the center of the [[Reference ellipsoid]])  such that &lt;math&gt;\hat{n}\,&lt;/math&gt; points in the direction north and such that &lt;math&gt;\hat{a},\ \hat{b}\,&lt;/math&gt; are in the equatorial plane of the Earth with &lt;math&gt;\hat{a}\,&lt;/math&gt; pointing towards the [[Orbital node|ascending node]], i.e. towards the blue point of Figure 2.

The components of the unit vectors
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{r},\ \hat{t},\ \hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt;

making up the local coordinate system (of which &lt;math&gt;\hat{t},\ \hat{z},&lt;/math&gt; are illustrated in figure 2), and expressing their relation with &lt;math&gt;\hat{a},\ \hat{b},\ \hat{n}\,&lt;/math&gt;, are as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;r_a= \cos u\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_b= \cos i \ \sin u\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_n= \sin i \ \sin u\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t_a=-\sin u\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t_b= \cos i \ \cos u\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t_n= \sin i \ \cos u\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_a= 0\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_b=-\sin i\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_n= \cos i\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u\,&lt;/math&gt; is the polar argument of &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; relative the orthogonal unit vectors &lt;math&gt;\hat{g}=\hat{a}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{h}=\cos i\ \hat{b}\ +\ \sin i\ \hat{n}\,&lt;/math&gt; in the orbital plane

Firstly

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \lambda =\ r_n\ =\ \sin i \ \sin u\,&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt;\lambda\,&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the equator plane and &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; (between the green points of figure 2) and from equation (12) of the article [[Geopotential model]] one therefore obtains
:  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
F_r = J_3\ \frac{1}{r^5}\ 2\ \sin i \ \sin u\,\ \left(5\sin^2 i \ \sin^2 u\ -\ 3\right)
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|12}}}}

Secondly the projection of direction north, &lt;math&gt;\hat{n}\,&lt;/math&gt;, on the plane spanned by &lt;math&gt;\hat{t},\ \hat{z},&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\sin i \ \cos u \ \hat{t}\ +\ \cos i \ \hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt;

and this projection is 
:&lt;math&gt;\cos \lambda \ \hat{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; orthogonal to the radial direction towards north illustrated in figure 1.

From equation ({{EquationNote|11}}) we see that

:&lt;math&gt;F_\lambda \ \hat{\lambda}\ = -J_3\ \frac{1}{r^5}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \left(5\ \sin^2\lambda\ -1\right)\ \cos\lambda\ \hat{\lambda}\ =\ -J_3\ \frac{1}{r^5}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \left(5\ \sin^2\lambda\ -1\right)\ (\sin i \ \cos u \ \hat{t}\ +\ \cos i \ \hat{z})\,&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore:
:   {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
F_t  =\ -J_3\ \frac{1}{r^5}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \left(5\ \sin^2 i \ \sin^2 u\ -1\right)\ \sin i \ \cos u
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|13}}}}
:  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
F_z =\ -J_3\ \frac{1}{r^5}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \left(5\ \sin^2 i \ \sin^2 u\ -1\right)\ \cos i
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|14}}}}

In the article [[Orbital perturbation analysis (spacecraft)]] it is further shown that the secular perturbation of the orbital pole &lt;math&gt;\hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt; is

:   {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \hat{z}\ =\ \frac{1}{\mu p}\left[\hat{g}\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}F_z r^3 \cos u \ du
+\ \hat{h}\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}F_z r^3 \sin u \ du \right]\quad \times \ \hat{z}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|15}}}}

Introducing the expression for &lt;math&gt;F_z\,&lt;/math&gt; of ({{EquationNote|14}}) in ({{EquationNote|15}}) one gets
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;\Delta \hat{z}\ = -\frac{J_3}{\mu\ p^3}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos i\ \cdot \\
&amp;\left[ \hat{g}\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}{\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^2\left(5\ \sin^2 i \ \sin^2 u\ -1\right) \cos u \ du\ + 
\hat{h}\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}{\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^2\left(5\ \sin^2 i \ \sin^2 u\ -1\right) \sin u \ du \right]\quad \times \ \hat{z} 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|16}}}}

The fraction &lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {p}{r}\ =\ 1 + e \cdot \cos \theta\ =\ 1 + e_g \cdot \cos u + e_h \cdot \sin u&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;e_g =\ e\ \cos \omega&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e_h =\ e\ \sin \omega&lt;/math&gt;

are the components of the eccentricity vector in the &lt;math&gt;\hat{g},\ \hat{h}\,&lt;/math&gt; coordinate system.

As all integrals of type
:&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \cos^m u \ \sin^n u\ du\,&lt;/math&gt;
are zero if not both &lt;math&gt;n\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m\,&lt;/math&gt; are even, we see that

: {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}{\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^2\left(5\ \sin^2 i \ \sin^2 u\ -1\right) \cos u \ du 
&amp;=\ 2\ e_g\ \left(5\ \sin^2 i \ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \sin^2 u \cos^2 u \ du \ -
\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \cos^2 u \ du \right) \\
&amp;=\ 2\pi\ e_g \ (\frac{5}{4} \sin^2 i-1)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|17}}}}

and

:  {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}{\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^2\left(5\ \sin^2 i \ \sin^2 u\ -1\right) \sin u \ du
&amp;=\ 2\ e_h\ \left(5\ \sin^2 i \ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \sin^4 u \ du \ -
\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \sin^2 u \ du \right) \\
&amp;=\ 2\pi\ e_h \ (\frac{15}{4} \sin^2 i-1)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|18}}}}

It follows that

: {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Delta \hat{z}\ &amp;=\  2\pi\ \frac{J_3}{\mu\ p^3}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos i\ \left[e_g \ (1-\frac{5}{4} \sin^2 i)\ \hat{g}
+\ e_h \ (1-\frac{15}{4} \sin^2 i)\ \hat{h}\right]\quad \times \ \hat{z} \\
&amp;=\ 2\pi\ \frac{J_3}{\mu\ p^3}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \cos i\ \left[

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|19}}}}

where

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{g}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{h}\,&lt;/math&gt; are the base vectors of the rectangular coordinate system in the plane of the reference Kepler orbit with &lt;math&gt;\hat{g}\,&lt;/math&gt; in the equatorial plane towards the ascending node and &lt;math&gt;u\,&lt;/math&gt; is the polar argument relative this equatorial coordinate system

:&lt;math&gt;f_z\,&lt;/math&gt; is the force component (per unit mass) in the direction of the orbit pole &lt;math&gt;\hat{z}\,&lt;/math&gt;

In the article [[Orbital perturbation analysis (spacecraft)]] it is shown that the secular perturbation of the eccentricity vector is

: {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \bar{e}\ =\frac {1}{\mu}\ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\left(-\hat{t}\ f_r\ + \ \left(2\ \hat{r}-\frac{V_r}{V_t}\ \hat{t}\right)\ f_t\right)\ r^2\ du
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|20}}}}

where

*&lt;math&gt;\hat{r},\hat{t}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the usual local coordinate system with unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt; directed away from the Earth
*&lt;math&gt;V_r = \sqrt{\frac {\mu}{p}} \cdot e \cdot \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt; - the velocity component in direction &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}\,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;V_t = \sqrt{\frac {\mu}{p}} \cdot (1 + e \cdot \cos \theta)&lt;/math&gt; - the velocity component in direction &lt;math&gt;\hat{t}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Introducing the expression for &lt;math&gt;F_r,\ F_t\,&lt;/math&gt; of ({{EquationNote|12}}) and ({{EquationNote|13}}) in ({{EquationNote|20}}) one gets
: {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;\Delta \bar{e}\ =\frac {J_3}{\mu\ p^3}\ \sin i\  \cdot \\ 
&amp;\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\left(-\hat{t}\ {\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^3\ 2 \ \sin u\,\ \left(5\sin^2 i \ \sin^2 u\ -\ 3\right)\ - \ \left(2\ \hat{r}-\frac{V_r}{V_t}\ \hat{t}\right)\ {\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^3\ \frac{3}{2}\ \left(5\ \sin^2 i \ \sin^2 u\ -1\right) \ \cos u\right)du
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|21}}}}

Using that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {V_r}{V_t} = \frac {e_g \cdot \sin u\ -\ e_h \cdot \cos u}{\frac {p}{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

the integral above can be split in 8 terms:

: {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\left(-\hat{t}\ {\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^3\ 2 \ \sin u\,\ \left(5\sin^2 i \ \sin^2 u\ -\ 3\right)\ - \ \left(2\ \hat{r}-\frac{V_r}{V_t}\ \hat{t}\right)\ {\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^3\ \frac{3}{2}\ \left(5\ \sin^2 i \ \sin^2 u\ -1\right) \ \cos u\right)\ du\ = \\
&amp;-10\sin^2 i \ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \hat{t}\ {\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^3\ \sin^3 u\ du \\
&amp;+6\ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\hat{t}\ {\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^3\ \sin u\ du \\
&amp;-15\ \sin^2 i \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \hat{r}\ {\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^3\ \sin^2 u  \ \cos u\ du \\
&amp;+3\ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \hat{r}\ {\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^3\ \cos u\ du  \\
&amp;+\frac{15}{2}\sin^2 i\ e_g\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \hat{t}\ {\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^2\ \ \ \sin^3 u \ \cos u\ du \\
&amp;-\frac{15}{2}\sin^2 i\ e_h \ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \hat{t}\ {\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^2\ \ \ \sin^2 u \ \cos^2 u\ du \\
&amp;-\frac{3}{2}\ e_g \ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \ \hat{t}\ {\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^2\ \ \sin u \ \cos u\ du \\
&amp;+\frac{3}{2}\ e_h \ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \hat{t}\ {\left(\frac{p}{r}\right)}^2\ \ \cos^2 u\ du
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|22}}}}

Given that
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{r}=\cos u\ \hat{g}\ +\ \sin u\ \hat{h}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{t}=-\sin u\ \hat{g}\ +\ \cos u\ \hat{h}&lt;/math&gt;

we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {p}{r}\ =\ 1 + e \cdot \cos \theta\ =\ 1 + e_g \cdot \cos u + e_h \cdot \sin u&lt;/math&gt;

and that all integrals of type

:&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi} \cos^m u \ \sin^n u\ du\,&lt;/math&gt;
are zero if not both &lt;math&gt;n\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m\,&lt;/math&gt; are even:

'''Global Youth Service Day''' ('''GYSD'''), originally launched and known as '''National Youth Service Day''' in the United States, is a coordinated annual event which gathers [[youth|young people]] around the world in conducting [[community service]], [[service learning]], and [[youth voice]] activities that benefit their communities, their countries, and the world. Activities are organized in more than 100 countries each April to help mark the celebrations, and engage millions, making it the largest annual celebration of young volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmayors.org/usmayornewspaper/documents/01_14_02/natl_youth.asp "National Youth Service Day"], U.S. Conference of Mayors.

Speaking about Global Youth Service Day, [[Jane Goodall]] commented, "I have often said that every individual counts, every individual has a role to play, and every individual makes a difference. Global Youth Service Day proves it." [[Kofi Annan]] said that, "Volunteers are some of our most valued partners, and Global Youth Service Day celebrates the efforts of the youngest of them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gysd.org/press/ Press Room], Global Youth Service Day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15468">'''Hiraṇyagarbha''' ([[Sanskrit]]: हिरण्यगर्भः ; literally the 'golden womb' or 'golden egg', poetically translated as 'universal germ') is the source of the creation of [[universe]] or the manifested [[cosmos]] in [[Vedic philosophy]], as well as an avatar of Vishnu in the [[Bhagavata Purana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/266775/Hiranyagarbha Hiranyagarbha] [[britannica.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; It finds mention in one hymn of the [[Rigveda]] ([[Mandala 10|RV 10]].121), known as the '''Hiraṇyagarbha Sūkta''', suggesting a single creator deity (verse 8: ''{{IAST|yo deveṣv ādhi devā eka āsīt}}'', Griffith: "He is the God of gods, and none beside him."), identified in the hymn as [[Prajapati|Prajāpati]]. The concept of the "golden womb" is again mentioned in the [[Vishvakarman]] Sūkta (RV 10.82).

The [[Upanishads|Upanishad]] calls it the Soul of the Universe or [[Brahman]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Philosophy of the Upanishads'', by Paul Deussen, Alfred Shenington Geden. Published by T. &amp; T. Clark, 1906. ''Page 198''.&lt;/ref&gt; and elaborates that Hiraṇyagarbha floated around in emptiness and the darkness of the non-existence for about a year, and then broke into two halves which formed the ''[[Svarga]]'' and the ''[[Prithvi|Pṛthvi]]''.

In classical [[Puranic|Purāṇic]] Hinduism, Hiraṇyagarbha is the term used in the Vedanta for the "creator". Hiraṇyagarbha is also [[Brahma|Brahmā]], so called because he was born from a golden egg ([[Manusmrti|Manu Smṛti]] 1.9), while the [[Mahabharata|Mahābhārata]] calls it the Manifest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12c002.htm The Mahābhārata, Book 12: Santi Parva. Kisari Mohan Ganguli, tr. ''Section CCCIII''] ''[[The Mahabharata]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hiraṇyagarbha is also a sacrifice, where it is known as Hiraṇyagarbha Yagna. This sacrifice was performed by the founder of the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty]], [[Dantidurga]], to confer Kshatriyahood on himself, as he was not born a [[Kshatriya]] but wanted to overthrow his [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukya]] overlord to set up the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakuta]] empire, and in olden days, the [[Caste System in India]] was very prevalent and he was not accepted by the people as their King, until he conferred Kshatriyahood upon himself.

Some classical yoga traditions consider Hiraṇyagarbha as the originator of [[yoga]], though this may also be a name for Rishi [[Kapila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Feuerstein |first= Georg |title= The Yoga Tradition: Its History, Literature, Philosophy and Practice |year= 2001 |publisher=  Hohm Press|location= Arizona, USA |isbn= 978-1890772185 |page= Kindle Locations 7299–7300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Aranya |first= Swami Hariharananda |authorlink= Swami Hariharananda Aranya |title= Yoga Philosophy of Patanjali with Bhasvati |year= 2000 |publisher= University of Calcutta |location= Calcutta, India |isbn= 81-87594-00-4|page=xxiii-xxiv | chapter = Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
{{Hindu philosophy}}
[[Matsya Purana|Matsya Purāṇa]] (2.25-30) gives an account of initial creation. After [[Mahapralaya|Mahāprālaya]], the great dissolution of the Universe, there was darkness everywhere. Everything was in a state of sleep. There was nothing, either moving or static. Then [[Svayambhu]], self-manifested Being arose, which is a form beyond senses. It created the primordial waters first and established the seed of creation into it. The seed turned into a golden womb, Hiraṇyagarbha. Then [[Svayambhu]] entered in the egg.

The [[Narayana sukta|Nārāyaṇa Sūkta]] exclaims that everything that is, visible or invisible, all this is pervaded by [[Narayana|Nārāyaṇa]] within and without.

The [[Ishavasya Upanishad|Īśvara Upaniṣad]] says that the universe is pervaded by [[Ishvara|Īśvara]] (God), who is both within and without it. He is the moving and the unmoving, He is far and near, He is within all these and without all these.

The [[Vedanta Sutra|Vedānta Sūtra]] further states that Brahman is That from Whom this Universe proceeds, in Whom it subsists, and to Whom, in the end, it returns.

The [[Samkhya|Saṃkhya]] school holds that there are only two primary principles, [[Purusha|Puruṣa]] and [[Prakriti|Prākṛti]], and creation is only a manifestation or evolution of the constituents of [[Prakriti|Prākṛti]] due to the action of [[Purusha|Puruṣa]]'s Consciousness.

The [[Bhagavata]] states that [[Narayana|Nārāyaṇa]] alone was in the beginning, who was the pious of principles of creation, sustenance, and dissolution (also known as the Hindu Trinity of [[Brahma|Brahmā]], [[Vishnu|Viṣṇu]] and [[Shiva]]) - the Supreme [[Hari]], multi-headed, multi-eyed, multi-footed, multi-armed, multi-limbed. This was the Supreme Seed of all creation, subtler than the subtlest, greater than the greatest, larger than the largest, and more magnificent than even the best of all things, more powerful, than even the wind and all the gods, more resplendent than the Sun and the Moon, and more internal than even the mind and the intellect. He is the Creator, the Supreme. The term can also mean as He who, having become first the Creator, has come to be considered as the womb of all objects.

==Hiraṇyagarbha Sūkta==

The Hiraṇyagarbha Sūkta of the [[Rigveda]] declares that God manifested Himself in the beginning as the Creator of the Universe, encompassing all things, including everything within Himself, the collective totality, as it were, of the whole of creation, animating it as the Supreme Intelligence.

===Translation in English===
In the beginning was the Divinity in his [[:wikt:splendour|splendour]], manifested as the sole Lord of land, skies, water, space and that beneath and He upheld the earth and the heavens.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offerings?

It is that who bestows soul-force and vigor, whose guidance all men invoke, the Devas invoke whose shadow is immortal life and death.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offerings?

It is that who by His greatness became the One King of the breathing and the seeing, who is the Lord of man and bird and beast.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offerings?

It is that through whose glory the snow-clad mountains rose, and the ocean spread with the river, they say. His arms are the quarters of the sky.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offerings ?

It is that through whom the heaven is strong and the earth firm, who has steadied the light and the sky's vault, and measured out the sphere of clouds in the mid-region.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offering?

It is that to whom heaven and earth, placed in the light by his grace, look up, radiant with the mind while over them the sun, rising, brightly shines.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offerings?

When the mighty waters came, carrying the universal germ, producing the flame of life, then dwelt there in harmony the One Spirit of the Devas.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offerings?

It is that who in its might surveyed the waters, conferring skill and creating worship - That, the God of gods, the One and only One.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offerings?

Mother of the world - may that not destroy us who with Truth as his Law made the heavens and produced waters, vast and beautiful.

Who is the deity we shall worship with our offerings?

Lord of creation! No one other than thee pervades all these that have come into being.

May that be ours, for which our prayers rise, may we be masters of many treasures!

-- ([[Mandala 10|RV 10]]:121)   '''[[Ralph T. H. Griffith]]
'''


1. HIRANYAGARBHA was present at the beginning ;
when born, he was the sole lord of created beings; he
upheld this earth and heaven,

-let us offer worship with
an oblation to the divine KA.

2. (To him) who is the giver of soul, the giver of strength,
Whose commands all (beings), even the gods obey, Whose
shadow is immortality, whose (shadow) is death,

-let us offer worship with an oblation to the divine KA.

3. (To him) who, by his greatness, has verily become
the sole king of the breathing and seeing world, who rules
over this aggregate of two-footed and four-footed beings,-

let us offer Worship with an oblation to the divine KA.

4. Through whose greatness these snow-clad (moun-
tains exist), whose property men call the ocean with the
rivers, whose are these quarters of space, whose are the
two arms,

--let us offer worship with an oblation to the
divine KA.

5. By whom the sky was made profound and the earth
solid, by Whom heaven and the solar sphere were fixed,
who was the measure of the water in the firmament,-

let us offer worship with an oblation to the divine KA.

6. Whom heaven and earth established by his pro-
tection, and, shining brightly, regarded with their mind,
in whom the risen sun shines forth,

-let us offer worship
with an oblation to the divine KA.

7. When the vast waters overspread the universe
containing the germ and giving birth to AGNI, then was
produced the one breath of the gods,

-let us offer worship
with an oblation to the divine KA.

8. He who by his might beheld the waters all around
containing the creative power and giving birth to sacrifice,
he who among the gods was the one supreme god,-

let us offer worship with an oblation to the divine KA.

9. May he do us no harm who is the parent of the
-earth, or who the unerring support (of the world) begat
the heaven, and who generated the vast and delightful
waters,

-let us offer worship with an oblation to the
divine KA.

10. No other than thou, PRAJAPATI, hast given existence to all these beings ; may that object of our desires
for which we sacrifice to thee be ours, may we be the
possessors of riches.

'''Kancha Ilaiah''', who now refers to himself symbolically as '''Kancha Ilaiah Shepherd''', (born 5 October 1952) is an Indian [[political theorist]], writer and activist for [[Dalit]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/rahul-writes-to-kancha-ilaiah-to-express-support/article25373576.ece|title=Rahul writes to Kancha Ilaiah to express support}}&lt;/ref&gt; He writes in both English and [[Telugu language|Telugu]].

Kancha Ilaiah Shepherd released his autobigraphy 'From a Shepherd boy to Intellectual' which is a first autobiography by any shudra in english language in India.
==Early life==
{{Criticism of religion sidebar}}
Kancha Ilaiah was born in the village of Papaiahpet, [[Warangal district]] in erstwhile [[Hyderabad State]].&lt;ref name=rediff&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2000/may/24ap.htm |work=Rediff |title=The attempt to censor my writings is part of a larger game plan |date=24 May 2000 |accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family belonged to the sheep-grazing [[Kuruba|Kuruma]] [[Golla (caste)|Golla]] caste, a community designated by the Government of India as an [[Other Backward Class]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-a-caste-reference-in-his-2009-book-has-come-back-to-haunt-kancha-ilaiah/story-q7EbiFUWXbW902JDn5u1MI.html|title=How a caste reference in his 2009 book has come back to haunt Kancha Ilaiah}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ilaiah credited his mother, Kancha Kattamma, as pivotal in shaping his political thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/how-cow-protection-laws-brutalise-our-culture/articleshow/53691544.cms|title=How cow protection laws brutalise our culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ilaiah, she was at the forefront of the Kurumas' struggle against the [[forest range officer|forest guards']] discriminatory behaviour. Kancha Kattamma was killed during a violent confrontation while protesting against police brutality.&lt;ref name="Kancha Ilaiah"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ambedkar.org/reformers/KanchaIlaiah.htm |title=Kancha Ilaiah |publisher=Ambedkar.org |date=16 November 2000 |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Dalit activist,&lt;ref name=rediff/&gt; Ilaiah is often identified as being a Dalit himself in news reports,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/07/india-president-ram-nath-kovind-takes-oath-170725074458219.html  India's President Ram Nath Kovind takes oath, Aljazeera]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/we-need-a-new-god-says-dalit-thinker-kancha-ilaiah/story-ooWKO6iUKLAXv7qFqEW4ML.html  Good Shepherd: Dalit thinker Kancha Ilaiah on name, caste,  May 27, 2016, Sudipto Mondal , Hindustan Times]&lt;/ref&gt; although he was in fact born into an Other Backward Class community.

==Professional life==
Ilaiah received an M.A. degree in [[political science]] and an M.Phil., awarded for his study of [[land reform in India|land reform]] in the south Indian state of [[Andhra Pradesh]].&lt;ref name=rediff/&gt; He has been a recipient of the [[Mahatma Jyotirao Phule]] Award and was a [[Jawarharlal Nehru Fellowship|Nehru Fellow]] between 1994-97.&lt;ref name=rediff/&gt;

Ilaiah earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] on the basis of his work exploring the political dimension of [[Buddhism in India|Buddhism]], culminating in ''God as Political Philosopher - Buddha Challenge to Brahminism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/modi-should-ask-sadhus-to-clean-the-streets/article8830075.ece|title=Modi should ask sadhus to clean the streets}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Ilaiah has encouraged proficiency in the English language for Dalits, arguing that it would allow Dalits in India to intellectually engage the world outside India without non-Dalits speaking "for them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/telangana/Introduce-English-in-all-schools-says-Kancha-Ilaiah/2016/08/08/article3568906.ece|title=Introduce English in all schools, says Dalit scholar Kancha Ilaiah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/interviews/Kancha-Ilaiah-Even-if-10-dalit-children-got-English-education-India-would-change/articleshow/18503625.cms&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/808852/in-defense-of-english-blame-the-education-system-not-the-language|title=In defence of English: Blame the Indian education system, not the language}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, in protest against "Brahmanic hegemony" he claims continues to persist in India, Ilaiah appended "Shepherd" to his name. Ilaiah identified in this choice recognition and reaffirmation of his family origins. As an English-language proper noun rather than its equivalent in an Indian language, "Shepherd" is meant to demonstrate a symbolic break with the cultural norms Ilaiah believed "Brahmins" sought to "impose" on Indian society. Ilaiah characterises his name change as a tool for the upliftment of Dalits.&lt;ref name="hindustantimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/we-need-a-new-god-says-dalit-thinker-kancha-ilaiah/story-ooWKO6iUKLAXv7qFqEW4ML.html |title=Good Shepherd: Dalit thinker Kancha Ilaiah on name, caste |work=Hindustan Times |date=2016-05-27 |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Ilaiah is serving as director of the Centre for Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy at [[Maulana Azad National Urdu University]] (MANUU) in [[Hyderabad]].

==Criticism==
While working as an associate professor in the Department of Political Science at [[Osmania University]], several of Ilaiah's colleagues as well as academics affiliated with the university expressed, in an open-letter, their concern with respect to certain articles and opinions Ilaiah had contributed to a local newspaper and advised him against writing material that could inflame sectarian discontent or prejudice.&lt;ref name=rediff/&gt;

In February 2013, at the [[Jaipur Literary Festival]], Ilaiah and [[Javed Akhtar]] engaged in a heated discussion over the implications of religion in Indian social life.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jaipur-literature-festival-ends-but-controversy-lingers/article4354622.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

Ilaiah has also been criticised for believing in the [[Indo-Aryan migration#"Aryan_invasion"|Aryan invasion theory]].&lt;ref name="hindustantimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2005/oct/18franc.htm|title=Who are real Dalits of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, Ilaiah stated that if [[Vallabhbhai Patel]], the first Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of India credited with forging national unity amidst the intense violence and bloodletting that followed the creation of Pakistan, had been Prime Minister of India, India "would have become Pakistan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/if-sardar-patel-was-pm-india-would-ve-become-pakistan-kancha-ilaiah/story-l3SqCY5Dqta6uu0TeLIYHJ.html |title=If Sardar Patel was PM, India would’ve become Pakistan: Kancha Ilaiah |work=Hindustan Times |date=2015-11-30 |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Ilaiah gave a controversial remark that vegetarianism is anti-nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/politics/vegetarians-are-anti-national-kancha-ilaiahs-hyperbole-illustrating-ambedkars-food-democracy-2728650.html|title=Vegetarianism is anti-nationalism: Kancha Ilaiah on Ambedkar's food democracy}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 September 2017, [[T. G. Venkatesh]], a member of [[Indian Parliament]] representing the [[Telugu Desam Party]] and a prominent leader of [[Arya Vysya]] said at a press conference that Ilaiah was a traitor and should be hanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TD MP TG Venkatesh says ‘Hang ilaiah’ for his book|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/180917/td-mp-tg-venkatesh-says-hang-ilaiah-for-his-book.html|publisher=The Deccan Chronicle|accessdate=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{why|date=March 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3790">'''[[Immanuel Kant]]'s antinomies''', from the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', are contradictions which he believed follow necessarily from our attempts to conceive the nature of transcendent reality.

Kant thought that certain of his antinomies (God and Freedom) could be resolved as "Postulates of Practical Reason". He used them to describe the equally rational-but-contradictory results of applying the universe of pure thought to the categories or criteria, i.e. applying reason proper to the universe of sensible perception or [[experience]] (phenomena). [[Empirical]] reason cannot here play the role of establishing rational truths because it goes beyond possible experience and is applied to the sphere of that which [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcends]] it.

==Overview==
Kant's antinomies are four: two "mathematical" and two "dynamical". They are connected with (1) the limitation of the universe in respect of space and time, (2) the theory that the whole consists of indivisible atoms (whereas, in fact, none such exist), (3) the problem of free will in relation to universal causality, and (4) the existence of a necessary being.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 11th ed. (1911), Vol. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first two antinomies are dubbed "mathematical" antinomies, presumably because in each case we are concerned with the relation between what are alleged to be sensible objects (either the world itself, or objects in it) and space and time. The second two are dubbed "dynamical" antinomies, presumably because the proponents of the thesis are not committing themselves solely to claims about spatio-temporal objects.&lt;ref&gt;S. Al-Azm, ''The Origins of Kant's Argument in the Antinomies'', Oxford University Press 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Grier, ''Kant's Doctrine of Transcendental Illusion'', Cambridge University Press 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Grier, "The Logic of Illusion and the Antinomies," in Bird (ed.), Blackwell, Oxford 2006, pp. 192-207.&lt;/ref&gt;

NOTE:  Kant himself did not use the plural term, "antinomies," but only the singular term, "Antinomy," as the logical status of a species of metaphysical argument.   There is Antinomy, and Kant argued in detail regarding four cases of Antinomy in his [[Critique of Pure Reason]] (1780).

==The mathematical antinomies==
===The first antinomy (of space and time)===
*Thesis:
**The world has a beginning in time, and is also limited as regards space.
*Anti-thesis:
**The world has no beginning, and no limits in space; it is infinite as regards both time and space.

===The second antinomy (of atomism)===
*Thesis:
**Every composite substance in the world is made up of simple parts, and nothing anywhere exists save the simple or what is composed of the simple.
*Anti-thesis:
**No composite thing in the world is made up of simple parts, and there nowhere exists in the world anything simple.

==The dynamical antinomies==
===The third antinomy (of spontaneity and causal determinism)===
*Thesis:
**Causality in accordance with laws of nature is not the only causality from which the appearances of the world can one and all be derived. To explain these appearances it is necessary to assume that there is also another causality, that of Spontaneity.
*Anti-thesis:
**There is no Spontaneity; everything in the world takes place solely in accordance with laws of nature.

===The fourth antinomy (of necessary being or not)===
*Thesis:
**There belongs to the world, either as its part or as its cause, a being that is absolutely necessary.
*Anti-thesis:
**An absolutely necessary being nowhere exists in the world, nor does it exist outside the world as its cause.

'''''Lambert v. California''''', 355 U.S. 225 (1957), was a [[United States Supreme Court]] case regarding the defense of [[ignorance of the law]] when there is no legal [[notice]].&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Law, 7th edition, 2012; [[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], [[Guyora Binder]]&lt;/ref&gt; The court held that, when one is required to register one's presence, failure to register may only be punished when there is a probability that the accused party had knowledge of the law before committing the crime of failing to register.

==Circumstances==
Lambert had previously been convicted of [[forgery]], a felony in [[California]]. She was unaware that a [[Los Angeles]] [[city ordinance]] required that she, being a felon, register if she remained in the city for more than five days. The ordinance stipulated that she, as a convicted criminal, could be fined $500 and sentenced to up to six months in jail for every day she remained in the city after the five-day limit. When she was arrested on suspicion of committing another offense she was convicted for failure to register. As Lambert was not allowed to use her lack of knowledge as a defense, she was convicted, fined $250 and sentenced to three years probation. Lambert appealed her case,  arguing that she had no knowledge that she had to register her name and  that convicting her would deprive her of [[due process]] under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref name="crimlaw"&gt;{{cite book |title=Criminal Law |last=Bonnie |first=Richard J. |authorlink= |author2=Coughlin, Anne M.  |year=1997 |publisher=The Foundation Press |location=Westbury, NY |isbn=978-1-56662-448-0 |pages=159&amp;ndash;161 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
The Supreme Court reversed Lambert's conviction,  holding that knowledge or probability of knowledge of a statute is required to convict someone of a notice offense. [[William O. Douglas|Justice William Douglas]], who delivered the majority opinion for the court, wrote:
{{Quote|Where a person did not know of the duty to register and where there was no proof of the probability of such knowledge, he may not be convicted consistently with due process.&lt;ref name="crimlaw"/&gt;}}

However, the court did not overturn the right of states and municipalities to force occupants to register for a given purpose. The court held that because the ordinance that forced convicted felons to register was not accompanied by any action, nor were there circumstances that would lead a felon to be aware of his or her duty to register, the ordinance was unconstitutional. The Justice continued:
{{Quote|Registration laws are common, and their range is wide. Many such laws are akin to licensing statutes in that they pertain to the regulation of business activities. But the present ordinance is entirely different. Violation of its provisions is unaccompanied by any activity whatever, mere presence in the city being the test. Moreover, circumstances which might move one to inquire as to the necessity of registration are completely lacking. At most, the ordinance is but a law enforcement technique designed for the convenience of law enforcement agencies through which a list of the names and addresses of felons then residing in a given community is compiled. The disclosure is merely a compilation of former convictions already publicly recorded in the jurisdiction where obtained. Nevertheless, this appellant, on first becoming aware of her duty to register, was given no opportunity to comply with the law and avoid its penalty, even though her default was entirely innocent. She could but suffer the consequences of the ordinance, namely, conviction with the imposition of heavy criminal penalties thereunder. We believe that actual knowledge of the duty to register or proof of the probability of such knowledge and subsequent failure to comply are necessary before a conviction under the ordinance can stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/355/225/case.html | title=Lambert v. California, 355 U.S. 225 (1957)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Significance==
This case is an exception to the legal principle ''[[ignorantia legis non excusat]]''—that the ignorance of the law is not a suitable excuse for breaking it. Because it deals with the motives (or lack thereof) for committing a crime, it addresses ''[[mens rea]]'', the degree of legal culpability that arises from the motivation of a criminal.

'''Merit''' (''{{lang-sa|puṇya}}'', ''{{lang-pi|puñña}}'') is a concept considered fundamental to [[Buddhist ethics]]. It is a beneficial and protective force which accumulates as a result of good deeds, acts, or thoughts. '''Merit-making''' is important to Buddhist practice: merit brings good and agreeable results, determines the quality of the [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|next life]] and contributes to a person's growth towards [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]]. In addition, merit is also shared with a deceased loved one, in order to help the deceased in their new existence. Despite [[Buddhist modernism|modernization]], merit-making remains essential in traditional Buddhist countries and has had a significant impact on the rural economies in these countries.

Merit is connected with the notions of purity and goodness. Before Buddhism, merit was used with regard to [[ancestor worship]], but in Buddhism it gained a more general ethical meaning. Merit is a force that results from good deeds done; it is capable of attracting good circumstances in a person's life, as well as improving the person's mind and inner well-being. Moreover, it affects the next lives to come, as well as [[Buddhist cosmology|the destination a person is reborn.]] The opposite of merit is [[Buddhist views on sin|demerit]] (''papa''), and it is believed that merit is able to weaken demerit. Indeed, merit has even been connected to the path to [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]] itself, but many scholars say that this refers only to some types of merit.

Merit can be gained in a number of ways, such as [[Dana (Buddhism)|giving]], [[Śīla|virtue]] and [[Bhavana|mental development]]. In addition, there are many forms of merit-making described in [[Buddhist texts|ancient Buddhist texts]]. A similar concept of ''kusala'' (''Sanskrit: kusala'') is also known, which is different from merit in some details. The most fruitful form of merit-making is those good deeds done with regard to the [[Triple Gem]], that is, the [[Buddha]], his teachings, the [[Dharma|Dhamma]] (''Sanskrit: Dharma''), and the [[Sangha]]. In Buddhist societies, a great variety of practices involving merit-making has grown throughout the centuries, sometimes involving great self-sacrifice. Merit has become part of [[Buddhist liturgy|rituals]], [[Buddhist practice|daily and weekly practice]], and [[Culture of Buddhism|festivals]]. In addition, there is a widespread custom of [[Pariṇāmanā|transferring merit]] to one's deceased relatives, of which the origin is still a matter of scholarly debate. Merit has been that important in Buddhist societies, that [[Buddhist kingship|kingship]] was often [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimated]] through it, and still is.

In modern society, merit-making has been criticized as materialist, but merit-making is still ubiquitous in many societies. Examples of the impact of beliefs about merit-making can be seen in the ''Phu Mi Bun'' rebellions which took place in the last centuries, as well as in the revival of certain forms of merit-making, such as the much discussed [[Life release|merit release]].

{{dfn|''Puñña''}} literally translates as 'merit, meritorious action, virtue'.{{sfn|Rhys Davids|Stede|1921|p=86}} It is glossed by the [[Theravāda]] Commentator [[Dhammapala|Dhammapāla]] as "''santanaṃ punāti visodheti''", meaning 'it cleans or purifies the life-continuity'.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=461}}{{sfn|Harvey|2012|p=44}} Its opposites are [[Buddhist views on sin|''apuñña'' (demerit) or ''pāpa'']] ('infertile, barren, harmful, bringing ill fortune'),{{sfn|Rhys Davids|Stede|1921|p=86}}{{sfn|Harvey|2012|p=44}}{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980b}} of which the term ''pāpa'' has become most common.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=461}} The term {{dfn|''merit''}}, originally [[Merit (Catholic Church)|a Judeo-Christian term]], has in the latter part of the twentieth century gradually been used as a translation of the Buddhist term ''puṇya'' or ''puñña''.{{sfn|Pye|Strong|1987|pp=5870, 5873}} The Buddhist term has, however, more of an impermanent character than the English translation implies,{{sfn|Hanks|1962|p=1247}} and the Buddhist term does not imply a sense of ''deserving''.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=18}}{{sfn|Cousins|1996|p=155}}

Before the arising of Buddhism, merit was commonly used in the context of [[Brahmanical]] sacrifice, and it was believed that merit accrued through such sacrifice would bring the devotee to an eternal heaven of the [[pitṛs|'fathers']] {{dfn|(''{{lang-sa|pitṛ, pitara}}'')}}.&lt;ref name="Holt 1981"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1 January 1981|title=Assisting the Dead by Venerating the Living: Merit Transfer in the Early Buddhist Tradition|journal=Numen|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1–28|doi=10.2307/3269794|jstor=3269794|last1=Holt|first1=John C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|pp=457–8}}{{sfn|Premasiri|1976|p=66}} Later, in the period of the [[Upanishads]], a concept of rebirth was established and it was believed that life in heaven was determined by the merit accumulated in previous lives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2010|encyclopedia=New Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Institute of Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Sciences, National public and Science Foundation|url=http://iphras.ru/elib/2256.html#|last=Shohin|first=V.K.|language=ru|trans-title=pāpa–puñña|script-title=ПАПА–ПУНЬЯ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|pp=457–8}}{{sfn|Premasiri|1976|p=66}} but the focus on the ''pitṛ'' did not really change.&lt;ref name="Holt 1981" /&gt; In Buddhism, the idea of an eternal heaven was rejected, but it was believed that merit could help achieve a rebirth in a temporary heaven.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|pp=457–8}} Merit was no longer merely a product of ritual, but was invested with an ethical meaning and role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.academia.edu/15728091|url-access=registration|last1=Norman|first1=K.R.|author-link=K.

In the [[Tipiṭaka]] (''{{lang-sa|Tripitaka}}''; the Buddhist scriptures), the importance of merit is often stressed. Merit is generally considered fundamental to Buddhist ethics, in nearly all Buddhist traditions.{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980b}}{{sfn|Tanabe|2004|p=532}}{{sfn|McFarlane|1997|p=409}} Merit-making is very important to Buddhist practice in Buddhist societies.&lt;ref name="Fuller 2016" /&gt;{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003}}{{sfn|Basham|1989|p=126}}

Merit is a "beneficial and protective force which extends over a long period of time" (B.J. Terwiel)—and is the effect of good deeds (''{{lang-pi|kamma}}'', ''{{lang-sa|karma}}'') done through physical action, words, or thought.&lt;ref name="Terwiel 1976"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1 January 1976|title=A Model for the Study of Thai Buddhism|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|volume=35|issue=3|pages=391–403|doi=10.2307/2053271|jstor=2053271|last1=Terwiel|first1=B.

A mixture of the two generates mixed results in a person's life. This {{dfn|[[Karma (buddhism)|karmic correspondence]]}} (''{{lang-pi|kamma-sarikkhatā}}'') or "automatic cosmic reaction" (Brokaw) is a common idea found in [[Buddhist texts]] and Buddhist societies,{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003}}{{sfn|Brokaw|2014|p=28}} and explains why people are different and lead different lives in many ways.&lt;ref name="Fuller 2016" /&gt;{{sfn|Keyes|1973|p=96}} Karma is self-regulatory and natural: it operates without divine intervention and human intention is fundamental to it.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=18}}{{sfn|Pye|Strong|1987|pp=5870, 5873}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1971|pp=204–5}} Internally, merit makes the mind happy and virtuous.&lt;ref name="KRC 2005"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.kasikornresearch.com/en/k-econanalysis/pages/ViewSummary.aspx?docid=2092|title=Thai Merit-Making: Bt3.3 Billion Cashflow for Merchants|date=22 February 2005|publisher=Kasikorn Research Center|accessdate=13 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018200510/https://www.kasikornresearch.com/en/k-econanalysis/pages/ViewSummary.aspx?docid=2092|archive-date=18 October 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Keyes|1983|p=268}}{{sfn|Cate|Lefferts|2006|p=589}} Externally, present good circumstances, such as a long life, health and wealth, as well as the character and abilities someone is born with, arise from merits done in the past and vice versa, with demerits.&lt;ref name="Terwiel 1976" /&gt;{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=29}}{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=158}} The merits and demerits a person has done may take a while to bear fruit.&lt;ref name="Rao Paranjpe 2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rao|first1=K.

== Discussion in traditional texts ==
=== General ===
Merit is not only a concept, but also a way of living.{{sfn|Mulder|1969|p=109}} The [[Pāli canon]] identifies three bases of merit (''{{IAST|puññakiriyā-vatthu}}''),{{sfn|Rhys Davids|Stede|1921|p=86}}{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=460}}{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=19}} in order of difficulty:{{sfn|Mulder|1969|pp=109–10}}{{Refn|group=note|In the Sangīti Sutta ("Chanting together discourse," [[Digha Nikaya]] 33), verse 38, [[Sariputra|the leading disciple Sāriputta]] is described as teaching the same triad: ''dāna'', ''sīla'', ''bhāvanā''.{{sfn|Walshe|1995|p=485}}}}
* giving (''{{IAST|dāna-maya}}'')
* {{dfn|virtue}} (''{{IAST|sīla-maya}}'')
* mental development (''{{IAST|bhāvanā-maya}}'')
In Buddhist texts and practice, giving is considered the easiest of the three bases of merit.{{sfn|Findly|2003|pp=185, 250}} It helps to overcome selfishness and stills the mind; it prepares the mind for the practice of virtue.{{sfn|McFarlane|1997|p=409}} It is also considered a form of saving, considering there is a rebirth in which people receive back what they have given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1 January 1972|title=Doctrine, Practice, and Belief in Theravada Buddhism (Review of Buddhism and Society: A Great Tradition and its Burmese Vicissitudes by Melford E. Spiro)|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|volume=31|issue=2|pages=373–380|doi=10.2307/2052605|jstor=2052605|last1=Lehman|first1=F. K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for virtue, this comprises three out of eight aspects of the [[eight-fold path]], the path central in the Buddhist teaching: [[right speech]], right action and [[right livelihood]]. Being the main criterion for moral behavior in Buddhism, virtue is mostly about the undertaking of [[five precepts]],{{sfn|McFarlane|1997|p=409}}{{sfn|Jones|1979|p=372}} although the [[eight precepts]] may be kept now and then.{{sfn|Namchoom|Lalhmingpuii|2016|p=47}} The five precepts are part of many Buddhist ceremonies, and are also considered a merit itself, helping the practitioner to become strong and healthy.{{sfn|McFarlane|1997|p=409}}{{sfn|Jones|1979|p=374}}{{sfn|Salguero|2013|p=344}} The benefits of practicing the three bases of merits are also summarized as three forms of happiness (''{{lang-pi|sampatti}}'')—happiness as a human being, happiness in heaven, and happiness in Nirvana.{{sfn|Skilling|2005|p=9832}} When people die, what world they will be reborn into depends on how intense they practice these three bases of merit. It is, however, only mental development that can take someone to the highest heavenly worlds, or to Nirvana.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|pp=460, 462}}
[[File:Monks doing Pindapatta before Vessak Day 2010 in Magelang.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|alt=Monk on almsround|Giving helps to overcome selfishness and stills the mind; it prepares the mind for the practice of virtue.{{sfn|McFarlane|1997|p=409}}]]
[[Pali literature#List of post-canonical Pali texts|Post-canonical texts]] and [[atthakatha|commentaries]]{{Refn|group=note|See [[Digha Nikaya|Digha Nikāya]] iii.218}} such as the [[Dhammasangani|Dhammasaṅganī]] and [[Atthasalini|Atthasālinī]],{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=470}}{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980c|p=275}} elaborating on the three bases of merit, state that [[upasaka|lay devotees]] can make merit by performing ten deeds. Seven items are then added to the previous three:
* Giving (''Dāna-maya'')
* Virtue (''Sīla-maya'')
* Mental development (''Bhāvanā-maya'')
* Honoring others (''Apacāyana-maya'')
* Offering service (''Veyyāvaca-maya'')
* Dedicating (or transferring) merit to others (Pāli:''Pattidāna-maya''; Sanskrit: ''puṇyapariṇāmanā'')
* Rejoicing in others' merit (''Pattānumodanā-maya'')
* Listening to teachings (''Dhammassavana-maya'')
* Instructing others in the teachings (''Dhammadesanā-maya'')
* Straightening one's own views in accordance with the Teachings (''Diṭṭhujukamma''){{sfn|Rhys Davids|Stede|1921|p=86}}{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=470}}{{sfn|Pye|Strong|1987|p=5873}}

These ten, the Commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] says, all fit within the three first bases of merit: 'Giving' includes 'Transferring merit to others' and 'Rejoicing in others' merit' by extension, whereas 'Virtue' includes 'Honoring others' and 'Offering service'. The remaining items 'Listening to Teachings', 'Instructing others in the Teachings' and 'Straightening one's own views' are part of 'Mental development'.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=470}} Thus, in Theravāda Buddhism, merit is always accrued through morally (good) actions. Such good deeds are also highly valued in the other two Buddhist schools, that is Mahāyāna (China, Japan, etc.) and [[Vajrayāna]] (Tibet, Nepal, etc.). In some forms of Mahāyāna or [[Vajrayāna]] it is believed, however, that even more merit will accrue from certain ritual actions, sometimes called the 'power of blessed substances' ''({{lang-bo|rdzas}})''. These are considered an addition to the traditional list and can help protect against calamities or other negative events caused by bad karma.{{sfn|Tanabe|2004|p=532}}{{sfn|Gutschow|2004|pp=14–5}}

A number of scholars have criticized the concepts of merit and karma as amoral, egoist and calculative, citing its quantitative nature and emphasis on personal benefits in observing morality.&lt;ref name="Jory 1996" /&gt;{{sfn|Spiro|1982|pp=105–7}}{{sfn|Keown|1992|p=13}} Other scholars have pointed out that in Buddhist ethics egoism and altruism may not be as strictly separated as in western thought, personal benefit and that of the other becoming one as the practitioner progresses on the spiritual path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3ISBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117|title=The golden rule: the ethics of reciprocity in world religions|last2=Chilton|first2=Bruce|date=2008|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-1-4411-9012-3|location=London|page=117|last1=Neusner|first1=Jacob}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2015|title=On the Classification of Śāntideva's Ethics in the Bodhicaryāvatāra|journal=Philosophy East and West|volume=65|issue=1|pages=249–275|doi=10.1353/pew.2015.0008|last1=Harris|first1=Stephen E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perret 1987"&gt;{{cite journal|date=March 1987|title=Egoism, altruism and intentionalism in Buddhist ethics|journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy|volume=15|issue=1|pages=71–85|doi=10.1007/BF00213993|last1=Perrett|first1=Roy W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist ethics is informed by Buddhist metaphysics, notably, the [[Anatta|not-self doctrine]], and therefore some western ethical concepts may not apply.&lt;ref name="Perret 1987" /&gt; Besides, as Keown notices, moral action would not be possible if it was not preceded by moral concern for others, as is illustrated by the example of the Buddha himself. Such moral concern is also part of the Buddhist path, cultivated through [[brahmavihara|loving-kindness and the other sublime attitudes]] (''{{lang-pi|brahamavihāra}}'').{{sfn|Keown|1992|pp=74–6}}

=== Accumulation and fruition ===
In post-canonical and vernacular Pāli literature, such as the [[Jātaka]] stories of the Buddha's previous lives, the [[Avadana|Avadānas]] and Anisaṃsa texts, as well as in many Mahāyāna texts, merit is the main concept. It is regarded as something which can be accumulated throughout different lifetimes in the process of attaining [[Buddhahood]], and is also instrumental in attaining it. The ''Bodhisatta'' intent on accomplishing Buddhahood and bringing other beings across the ocean of suffering, must do so by accumulating all sorts of merits, in this context also called [[Pāramitā|perfections]] (''{{lang-pi|pāramī}}''; ''{{lang-sa|pāramitā}}''). This form of merit-making is always led by a [[Praṇidhāna|vow for enlightenment]] (''{{lang-pi|panidhāna}}''; ''{{lang-sa|praṇidhāna}}''), and an intention to enlighten others as well, as well as the transferring of merits to all living beings to that effect.{{sfn|Pye|Strong|1987|p=5874}}{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=45, 57, 59}}{{sfn|Skilling|2005|pp=9833, 9839}} Another aspect of meritorious acts, emphasized more in later literature, is the idea that a single meritorious act done will reap many fruits, as, for example, expressed in the [[Vimanavatthu|Vimānavatthu]]. Not only is the quality of people's next rebirth affected by their merits, but also the circumstances in which they are reborn; not only in the next life, but also in adjacent lives after that. Wealth, lifespan, and position are all contingent on merit.{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=29}}{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=158}}

In Buddhist texts further details are given in what way and to what extent a meritorious deed will bring results: this depends on the spiritual quality of the recipient, the spiritual attitude of the giver, the manner in which one gives and the object given.&lt;ref name="Heim 2004" /&gt;{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=20}}{{sfn|Pye|Strong|1987|p=5873}} If the recipient is a human, the gift yields more fruits than if the recipient is an animal, but a gift to a {{dfn|[[samanera|sāmaṇera]]}} (a young monk), a monk, many monks, and the Buddha yield even more fruits, in ascending order.{{sfn|Brekke|1998|p=301}}{{sfn|Spiro|1982|pp=108–9}} If the giver is motivated by greed or other [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|defilements of the mind]], the merit gained will be much less than if the giver is motivated by loving-kindness or other noble intentions.{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=94}} Even the intention of going to heaven, though in itself not considered wrong, is not seen as lofty as the intention to want to develop and purify the mind. If the recipient is spiritually "not worthy of the gift", the gift will still be meritorious provided the giver's intention is good, and this is also valid the other way around.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|pp=19, 21–2}}{{sfn|Brekke|1998|pp=301, 309–10}} Good thoughts must also be maintained after the good deed is done, as regretting the gift will also decrease the merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JOxDp7SRYNUC&amp;dq|title=The way to Nirvana: Six lectures on ancient Buddhism as a discipline of salvation|date=1917|publisher=Library of Alexandria|isbn=978-1-4655-7944-7|series=Hibbert lectures|last1=de La Vallée Poussin|first1=Louis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the giver pronounces a certain wish or intention also affects the meritorious deed, as the power of the merits can be channeled toward a certain purpose.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=468}}{{sfn|Walters|2003|pp=23–4}}{{sfn|Gómez|2002|pp=30–1}}{{Refn|group=note|[[Sacca-kiriya|The announcing of a certain intention in reference to the actions someone has done]] (''{{lang-pi|saccakiriya}}'') is a common theme in all Indian religion {{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=468}}}} The manner in which people give is also important: whether someone gives respectfully or not, and whether by giving someone is harming anyone. With regard to the size of the gift, a larger gift is usually more meritorious than a smaller one, but purity of mind affects merit more than the gift's size.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|pp=20–1, 192}} It is therefore recommended to give as much as you can afford, no more and no less.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=110}} Such care in choosing who to give to and how to give, is called being 'skilled in merit' (''{{lang-pi|puññassa kovidā}}'').{{sfn|Findly|2003|p=260}}

A teaching that exists in both Mahāyāna ''sūtras'' and Theravādin ''suttas'' is the teaching on the Ten Wholesome Ways of Action (''{{lang-pi|kusaladhamma}}''). In Mahāyāna, this teaching is described as the way in which a ''[[Bodhisattva]]'' prevents "suffering in all [[Niraya|evil destinies]]".&lt;!-- I am not mentioning the translator specifically, because both translations linked translate in the same way as "evil destinies". It doesn't seem to be creative content. --&gt; These ten wholesome ways are:
* In giving up the taking of life, the practitioner will accomplish freedom from vexations;
* In giving up stealing, the practitioner will find security in life, economically, socially and spiritually;
* In giving up wrongful (sexual) conduct, the practitioner will find inner peace and peace in the family life;
* In giving up lying, the practitioner will attain purity of speech and mind;
* In giving up slander, the practitioner will be protected socially and spiritually;
* In giving up harsh language, the practitioner's words will be more effective;
* In giving up frivolous speech, the practitioner will become wise and dignified;
* In giving up lust, the practitioner finds freedom in life through contentment and simplicity;
* In giving up hatred, the practitioner will develop kindness and gentleness;
* In giving up wrong views, the practitioner will not falter in the good and spiritual path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Saddhaloka|title=The Discourse on the Ten Wholesome Ways of Action|url=http://www.buddhistdoor.com/OldWeb/resources/sutras/wholesome_sutra.htm|website=Buddhistdoor|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The discourse on the ten wholesome ways of action|journal=Undumbara Garden|date=23 September 2009|url=http://undumbara.wordpress.com/2009/09/23/the-discourse-on-the-ten-wholesome-ways-of-action/|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ten actions are described as {{dfn|''akusala''}} ('unwholesome'; ''{{lang-sa|akuśala}}''), and when abstaining from them it is called {{dfn|''kusala''}} ('wholesome'; ''{{lang-sa|kuśala}}'').{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|pp=459, 464}}{{refn|group=note|There is some discussion as to the best translation of ''kusala'', some preferring 'skilful' or 'intelligent' instead.{{sfn|Cousins|1996|pp=137–8}}}} Moreover, ''kusala'' and ''akusala'' are depicted as having 'roots' (''mūla''). ''Akusalamūla'' are the roots of evil in the mind (the [[Kilesa|defilements]]), whereas the ''kusalamūla'' are roots connected with good qualities of the mind. Both of them are called ''roots'' because they are qualities that can be cultivated and grown in the mind.{{sfn|Gómez|2002|pp=324–5}}{{sfn|Thomas|1953|p=120}}

''Puñña'' and ''pāpa'' are close in meaning to ''kusala'' and ''akusala''. Both pairs are used for distinguishing between ethically right and wrong. However, even though the negatives ''akusala'' and ''pāpa'' have almost the same meaning, there are some differences between the positives, ''kusala'' and ''puñña''. According to [[P. D. Premasiri]], ''Kusala'' is used to describe a more direct path to [[Nirvana]] than ''puñña''.{{sfn|Premasiri|1976}}{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|pp=463–5}} [[Damien Keown]], however, believes they are merely different angles of the same concept: ''kusala'' refers to the moral status of an action, whereas ''puñña'' refers to the experience of the consequences of the action.{{sfn|Keown|1992|p=123}} He further points out that in the Pāli {{dfn|''[[suttas]]''}} (discourses) mental development (''bhāvanā'') practices such as meditation are also included in the path of merit. It is unlikely that in the Tipiṭaka meditation would be regarded as an indirect path or obstacle to Nirvana,{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=467}}{{sfn|Keown|1992|p=90}} and there are passages that directly relate merit to Nirvana.{{sfn|Egge|2013|pp=55–6}}{{sfn|Collins|1997|p=290}} Sometimes a distinction is made between worldly (''{{lang-pi|lokīya}}'') and transcendental (''{{lang-pi|lokuttara}}'') merit, in which only transcendental merit leads to liberation.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=95}}{{sfn|Collins|1997|p=482}} The Thai scholar and monastic [[Prayudh Payutto|Phra Payutto]] believes that ''merit'' and ''kusala'' are both used to describe the 'cleanliness of the mind' ({{RTGS|Khwam sa-at mot jot}}). But whereas ''merit'' aims for the 'beautiful and praiseworthy' ({{RTGS|Suai-ngam na chuenchom}}) aspect of such cleanliness, with worldly benefits such as wealth, praise and happiness; ''kusala'' aims for the 'purity' ({{RTGS|borisut}}) aspect of cleanliness, with enlightenment as its benefit. Phra Payutto does add that both need to be accumulated on the Buddhist path. In making this comparison, he says this only holds for worldly merit, not for transcendental merit. Collins equates transcendental merit with ''kusala''.{{sfn|Collins|1997|p=495}}&lt;ref name="Payutto 1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Payutto|first1=Phra|title=พจนานุกรมพุทธศาสน์ ฉบับประมวลศัพท์|script-title=พจนานุกรมพุทธศาสตร์ ฉบับประมาลศัพท์|trans-title=Dictionary of Buddhism, Vocabulary|date=1993|language=th|publisher=[[Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya University]]|location=Bangkok|isbn=978-974-575-029-6|pages=25–6,179|edition=7|url=http://www.watnyanaves.net/uploads/File/books/pdf/dictionary_of_buddhism_vocabulary_version.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the earlier Pāli texts, ''kusala'' was much more commonly used than ''puñña'', ''puñña'' mostly being used in the context of the practice of giving.{{sfn|Cousins|1996|pp=154–5}}

In a widely quoted theory, [[Melford Spiro]] and Winston King have distinguished two forms of Buddhism found in traditional Buddhist societies, "kammatic Buddhism" focused on activities such as merit-making, and "nibbanic Buddhism" which focuses on the liberation from suffering and rebirth.{{sfn|Spiro|1982}} In this theory, called the "transcendency thesis" (Keown), Buddhism has two quite separate aims, which are pursued by separate groups, that is, laypeople (kammatic) and monks (nibbanic). This view has, however, been downplayed or criticized by many other scholars, who believe that kammatic practices are in many ways connected to nibbanic practices, and the aims of monks and laypeople cannot be that easily separated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1 January 1979|title=The Relationship of the Karmic to the Nirvanic in Theravāda Buddhism|journal=The Journal of Religious Ethics|volume=7|issue=1|pages=28–36|jstor=40018241|last1=Aronson|first1=Harvey B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Swearer|1995|p=10}}{{sfn|Keown|1992|pp=85–105}}

This transcendency thesis has also been applied to scriptural interpretation. When discussing the path to the attainment of Nirvana, in some passages in the Tipiṭaka merit is rejected. For example, in the Padhāna Sutta, the [[Bodhisatta#Theravāda Buddhism|''Bodhisatta'' (the Buddha Gotama to be)]] is tempted by [[Mara (demon)|''Māra'']] to give up his [[Self-mortification|self-torture]] practices to do meritorious acts instead. The ''Bodhisatta'' replies that even a bit of merit is no use to him (''{{lang-pi|"anumattenāpi puññena attho mayhaṃ na vijjati"}}''). Some scholars, supporting the transcendency thesis, have interpreted this to mean that merit can only lead to happiness and progress within ''Saṃsāra'', but does not lead to Nirvana, and must in fact be discarded before attaining Nirvana.{{sfn|Premasiri|1976|p=68}}{{sfn|Keown|1992|p=89}}{{sfn|Egge|2013|p=23}} Marasinghe believes, however, that the word ''merit'' in this passage refers to merit in the pre-Buddhist Brahmanical sense, connected with rituals and sacrifice, and the lay life.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=462–3}} Another example often quoted in this context is the [[Yana (Buddhism)#Teaching story and metaphor|simile of the raft]], which states that both ''dhamma'' and ''adhamma'' should be let go of in order to attain liberation. Whereas the term ''adhamma'' in the text clearly refers to evil views, the meaning of ''dhamma'' is subject to different interpretations. Considering that no other similar passage can be found in the Tipiṭaka, Keown believes that only this passage is not enough to base the transcendency thesis on.{{sfn|Keown|1992|pp=94–105}}

In the Pāli Canon, an [[arahat|enlightened person]] is said to be neutral in terms of karma, that is, the person no longer generates karma, merit, or demerit.{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980b}}{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|pp=466,471}}{{sfn|McDermott|1975|pp=431–2}} Some scholars have interpreted this to mean that an enlightened person attains a state where distinctions between good and evil no longer exist. Other scholars have criticized this as making little sense, considering how the Buddha would normally emphasize ethics. The fact that an enlightened person is neutral in terms of karma, does not mean he is {{em|ethically}} neutral.{{sfn|Premasiri|1976|p=73}}{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|pp=465–6}} Indeed, the Buddha is quoted in the Tipiṭaka as saying he is foremost in 'higher morality' (''adhisīla'').{{sfn|Keown|1992|p=113}} Keown attempts to overcome this problem by proposing that enlightened people are beyond the accumulative experience of good deeds (merit, ''puñña''), since they are already perfected. They therefore do not need to accumulate goodness and the resulting happiness anymore. They no longer need to strive for a happy rebirth in the next life, because they have gone beyond rebirth. Their enlightenment is, however, an {{em|ethical}} perfection as well, though this is solely described as ''kusala'', not as ''puñña''.&lt;ref name="Goodman 2009"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0a32BJT4ZM8C|title=Consequences of Compassion: An Interpretation and Defense of Buddhist Ethics|date=2009|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-988845-0|last1=Goodman|first1=Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Keown|1992|pp=90,124,127–8}}{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=43}}

== Field of merit ==
[[File:Terenuri cultivate în lângă Orheiul Vechi.JPG|thumb|upright=1|right|alt=a farming field|The main concept of the field of merit is that good deeds done towards some recipients accrue more merit than good deeds to other recipients. This is compared with a seed planted in fertile ground, which reaps more and better fruits than in infertile ground.{{sfn|Salguero|2013|p=342}}{{sfn|Brekke|1998|pp=299–300}}]] In pre-Buddhist Brahmanism, Brahmin priests used to perform {{dfn|''[[yajna|yajña]]''}}''s'' (sacrifices) and thereby generating merit for the donors who provided gifts for the sacrifice. In Buddhism, it was the Buddhist monk who assumed this role, considered qualified to receive generosity from devotees and thereby generating merit for them. He came to be described as ''āhuneyyo'' ('worthy of offering'), by analogy with the Brahmanical term ''āhavanīya'' ('worthy of sacrifice', used in offerings to the ritual fire); and as ''dakkhiṇeyyo'' ('qualified to accept the offering'), by analogy with the Brahmanical ''[[Dakshina|dakśiṇā]]'', the sacrificial offering itself.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=459}}{{sfn|Egge|2013|pp=19–20}}{{sfn|Findly|2003|pp=217–8, 222}} The Sangha (monastic community) was also described as {{dfn|'field of merit'}} (''{{lang-pi|puññakkhetta}}''; ''{{lang-sa|puṇyakṣetra}}'').{{sfn|Rhys Davids|Stede|1921|p=87}}{{sfn|Brekke|1998|p=299}}{{sfn|Egge|2013|p=20}} The difference with the Brahmanical tradition was, according to Marasinghe, that Buddhism did recognize {{em|other}} ways of generating merit apart from offerings to the monk, whereas the Brahmanical ''yajña'' {{em|only}} emphasized offerings to the Brahmin priest. That is not to say that such offerings were not important in [[Pre-sectarian Buddhism|early Buddhism]]: giving to the Sangha was the first Buddhist activity which allowed for community participation, and preceded the first rituals in Buddhism.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=459}}

The main concept of the field of merit is that good deeds done towards some recipients accrue more merit than good deeds to other recipients. This is compared with a seed planted in fertile ground which reaps more and better fruits than in infertile ground.{{sfn|Salguero|2013|p=342}}{{sfn|Brekke|1998|pp=299–300}}{{sfn|Adamek|2005|p=141}} The Sangha is described as a field of merit, mostly because the members of the Sangha follow the eight-fold path. But in many texts, the Buddha and the Dhamma, and their representations, are also described as fields of merit. For example, Mahāyāna tradition considers production and reverence of Dharma texts very meritorious—this tradition, sometimes referred to as the "cult of the book" ([[Gregory Schopen]]), stimulated [[Buddhist influences on print technology|the development of print technology in China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%202.pdf|title=Buddhist Books and Texts: Ritual Uses of Books|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion|publisher=Thomson Gale|location=Detroit|date=2005|edition=2|volume=2|pages=1261–4|isbn=978-0-02-865735-6|last1=Gummer|first1=Nathalie|editor1-last=Jones|editor1-first=Lindsay|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302073830/https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%202.pdf|archivedate=2 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Williams|2008|pp=45, 145, 149}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kieschnick|first1=John|title=The impact of Buddhism on Chinese material culture|date=2003|publisher=University Presses of California, [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] and [[Princeton University Press|Princeton]]|location=New Jersey|isbn=978-0-691-09676-6|pages=180–1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sgkKbE-9EhAC&amp;pg=PA180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other traditions a Buddha image is also considered a field of merit, and any good deed involving a Buddha image is considered very meritorious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%2014.pdf|last1=Morgan|first1=David|editor1-last=Jones|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion|volume=14|editor1-first=Lindsay|title=Buddhism: Buddhism in Tibet|date=2005|publisher=[[Thomson Gale]]|location=Detroit|isbn=978-0-02-865983-1|page=9623|edition=2|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302052223/http://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%2014.pdf|archivedate=2 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Skilling|2005|p=9829}} A meritorious deed will also be very valuable (and sometimes viewed in terms of a field of merit) if performed to repay gratitude to someone (such as parents), or performed out of compassion for those who suffer.{{sfn|Tanabe|2004|p=532}}{{sfn|Salguero|2013|p=345}}{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=23}} Deeds of merit done towards the Sangha as a whole {{dfn|(''{{lang-pi|saṅghadāna}}'')}} yield greater fruits than deeds done towards one particular recipient (''{{lang-pi|pāṭipuggalikā dakkhiṇā}}'') or deeds done with favoritism.&lt;ref name="Heim 2004"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|title=Dāna|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA, [[Thomson Gale]]|location=New York (u.a.)|last=Heim|first=Maria|date=2004|volume=2|isbn=978-0-02-865720-2|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pye|Strong|1987|p=5873}}{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=22}} Indeed, ''saṅghadāna'' yields even more fruits than deeds of merit to the person of the Buddha himself.{{sfn|Brekke|1998|p=301}}{{sfn|Adamek|2005|p=140}}

== Practice in Buddhist societies ==
{{Quote box |tstyle = text-align: left; |quote  = Thus the Buddhist's view of his present activities has a wider basis, they being but one group of incidents in an indefinitely prolonged past, present and future series. They are, as has been said, no mere train of witnesses for or against him, but a stage in a cumulative force of tremendous power. He and his works stand in a mutual relation, somewhat like that of child to parent in the case of past works, of parent to child in the case of future works. Now no normal mother is indifferent as to whether or how she is carrying out her creative potency. Nor can any normal Buddhist not care whether his acts, wrought up hourly in their effect into his present and future character, are making a happy or a miserable successor.
And so, without any definite belief as to how, or in what realm of the universe he will re-arise as that successor to his present self, the pious Buddhist, no less than his pious brethren of other creeds, goes on giving money and effort, time and thought to good works, cheerfully believing that nothing of it can possibly forgo its effect, but that it is all a piling up of merit or creative potency, to result, somewhere, somewhere, somehow, in future happiness—happiness which, though he be altruistic the while, is yet more a future asset of his, than of some one in whom he naturally is less interested than in his present self. He believes that, because of what he is now doing, some one now in process of mental creation by him, and to all intents and purposes his future " self," will one day taste less or more of life's trials. To that embryonic character he is inextricably bound ever making or marring it, and for it he is therefore and thus far responsible. |author = [[C. A. F.

=== Merit-making ===

In Pāli texts several of such terms were used.{{sfn|Findly|2003|pp=256–7}}}} In Buddhist societies, such merit-making is common, especially those meritorious deeds which are connected to monks and temples. In this regard, there is a saying in Burma, "Your hands are always close to offering donations".&lt;ref name="Fuller 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Seeger" /&gt;{{sfn|Marston|2006|p=171}} Contrary to popular conceptions, merit-making is done by both monastics and laypeople alike.{{sfn|Egge|2013|p=61}}{{sfn|Mulder|1969|p=115}}{{sfn|Schopen|1997|pp=ix–x, 31}} Buddhist monks or lay Buddhists earn merit through [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]], meditation, chanting and other rituals. Giving is the fundamental way of making merit for many laypeople, as monks are not allowed to cook by themselves.{{sfn|Cate|Lefferts|2006|p=589}} Monastics in their turn practice themselves to be a good field of merit and make merit by teaching the donors. Merit-making has thus created a [[symbiotic]] relationship between laypeople and Sangha,&lt;ref name="Heim 2004" /&gt;{{sfn|Pye|Strong|1987|p=5873}}{{sfn|Namchoom|Lalhmingpuii|2016|p=52}} and the Sangha is obligated to be accessible to laypeople, for them to make merit.{{sfn|Findly|2003|p=226}}

Giving can be done in several ways. Some laypeople offer food, others offer robes and supplies, and others fund ceremonies, build monasteries or persuade a relative to ordain as a monk. Young people often temporary ordain as monks, because they believe this will not only yield fruits of merit for themselves, but also for their parents who have allowed them to ordain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/Encyclopedia%20of%20Religious%20Practices%20Vol1.pdf|year=2006|title=Buddhism|encyclopedia=Worldmark Encyclopedia of Religious Practices|publisher=[[Thomson Gale]]|location=Farmington Hills|volume=1|page=68|isbn=978-0-7876-6612-5|author=Kinnard, Jacob|editor=Riggs, Thomas|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302030021/http://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/Encyclopedia%20of%20Religious%20Practices%20Vol1.pdf|archivedate=2 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%202.pdf|title=Buddhism: Buddhism in Tibet|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion|publisher=Thomson Gale|location=Detroit|date=2005|edition=2|volume=2|page=1155|isbn=978-0-02-865735-6|last1=Kapstein|first1=Maththew T.|editor1-last=Jones|editor1-first=Lindsay|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302073830/https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%202.pdf|archivedate=2 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=95}} In China, Thailand and India, it used to be common to offer land or the first harvest to a monastery.{{sfn|Walsh|2007|pp=362–6}}{{sfn|Namchoom|Lalhmingpuii|2016|p=52}}{{sfn|Fuengfusakul|1998|pp=53-4}} Also, more socially oriented activities such as building a hospital or bridge, or giving to the poor are included in the Tipiṭaka, and by many Buddhists considered meritorious.{{sfn|Premasiri|1976|p=68}}{{sfn|Mulder|1969|p=115}}{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=126}} In fieldwork studies done by researchers, devotees appreciated the merits of becoming ordained and supporting the building of a temple the most.{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=95}}{{sfn|Mulder|1969}} Fisher found that building a temple was considered a great merit by devotees, because they believed they would in that way have part in all the wisdom which would be taught at that temple.{{sfn|Fisher|2008|p=148}} People may pursue merit-making for different reasons, as Buddhist orthodoxy allows for various ideals, this-worldly or ultimate.{{sfn|Swearer|1995|p=6}} Although many scholars have pointed out that devotees often aim for this-worldly benefits in merit-making,{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=101}}{{sfn|Mulder|1979|p=127}} it has also been pointed out that in old age, people tend to make merit with a view on the next life and liberation.{{sfn|Mulder|1979|p=127}}{{sfn|Swearer|1995|p=22}} Among lay people, women tend to engage in merit-making more than men, and this may be a way for them to enhance [[empowerment]].{{sfn|Cate|Lefferts|2006|p=589}}{{sfn|Bao|2005|p=124}}{{sfn|Marston|2006|p=172}} Very often, merit-making is done as a group, and it is believed that such shared merit-making will cause people to be born together in next lives.

=== Recording ===
In several Buddhist countries, it has been common to record merits done. In China, it was common for many centuries to keep record of someone's meritorious deeds in 'merit ledgers' ({{zh|p=gōngguò gé}}). Although a belief in merit and retribution had preceded the merit ledgers by many centuries,&lt;!--only Brokaw--&gt; during the [[Ming dynasty]], through the ledgers a practice of systematic merit accumulation was established for the first time. The merit ledgers were lists of good deeds and bad deeds, organized in the form of a calendar for users to calculate to what extent they had been practicing good deeds and avoiding bad deeds every day. The ledgers also listed the exact retributions of every number of deeds done, to the detail.&lt;!--both--&gt; Through these ledgers it was believed someone could offset bad karma.&lt;!--only Brokaw--&gt;{{sfn|Brokaw|2014|pp=3–4, 31–2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=Richard H.|last2=Johnson|first2=Willard L.|title=The Buddhist religion: a historical introduction|date=1977|publisher=[[Cengage]]|location=Belmont, California|isbn=978-0-534-20718-2|page=215|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourth century [[Common Era|CE]], the ''[[Baopuzi]]'', and in the twelfth century the ''[[Treatise On the Response of the Tao]]'' and the ''[[Ledger of Merit and Demerit of the Taiwei Immortal]]'' introduced the basics of the system of merit ledgers. In the fourteenth century CE, the [[Tao]] master Zhao Yizhen recommended the use of the ledgers to examine oneself, to bring emotion in harmony with reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%202.pdf|title=Daoism: An overview|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion|publisher=Thomson Gale|location=Detroit|date=2005|edition=2|volume=4|page=2187|isbn=978-0-02-865737-0|last1=Bokenkamp|first1=Stephen R.|editor1-last=Jones|editor1-first=Lindsay|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302073830/https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%202.pdf|archivedate=2 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Brokaw|2014|pp=31–2}} From the fourth to the sixteenth centuries, many types of ledgers were produced by Buddhist and Tao schools, and the usage of the ledgers grew widespread.{{sfn|Brokaw|2014|pp=3–4}} The practice of recording merits has survived in China and Japan until the present day.{{sfn|Tanabe|2004|p=533}} In Theravāda countries, for example in Burma and Sri Lanka, similar customs have been observed.{{sfn|Rotman|2008}}{{sfn|Spiro|1982|pp=111–2, 454}} In Sri Lanka, a {{dfn|'book of merit'}} (''{{lang-pi|puñña-potthaka}}'', ''{{lang-sa|puṇyapustaka}}'') was sometimes kept by someone for years and read in the last moments of life.

=== Merit and wealth ===
The association of wealth with merits done has deeply affected many Buddhist countries. The relation between giving and wealth is ubiquitous in vernacular Pāli literature, and many stories of exemplary donors exist, such as the stories of [[Anathapindika|Anāthapiṇḍika]] and Jōtika.{{sfn|Scott|2009|pp=30–2, 97}} In Buddhism, by emphasizing the usage of wealth for generosity, accumulating wealth for giving purposes thus became a spiritual practice.{{sfn|Findly|2003|p=2}} But using wealth in unrighteous ways, or hoarding it instead of sharing and giving it, is condemned extensively. Greed is what keeps a person wandering in [[Saṃsāra|''Saṃsāra'' (the cycle of rebirth)]], instead of becoming liberated. It is the attachment to wealth that is an obstacle on the spiritual path, not wealth per se. Stories illustrating these themes in vernacular Buddhist literature, have profoundly influenced [[popular culture]] in Buddhist countries.&lt;ref name="Goodman 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%202.pdf|title=Wealth|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion|publisher=[[Thomson Gale]]|location=Detroit|date=1987|edition=2|volume=14|page=9708|isbn=978-0-02-865983-1|last1=Davis|first1=Winston|editor1-last=Jones|editor1-first=Lindsay|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302073830/https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%202.pdf|archivedate=2 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Scott|2009|pp=30–2, 97}} Several scholars have described merit as a sort of spiritual currency or bookkeeping system.&lt;ref name="Langer 2007" /&gt;{{sfn|Rotman|2008}}{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=111}} Though objections have been made against this metaphor,&lt;ref name="Schlieter 2013" /&gt;{{sfn|Keyes|1983|pp=18–9}} it is not new. Similar comparisons have been made in the Milinda Pañhā, and in seventeenth-century China. Moreover, Schopen has shown that Buddhism has had strong connections with the mercantile class, and Rotman thinks that a mercantile ethos may have informed Buddhist texts such as the [[Divyavadana|Divyāvadāna]].{{sfn|Collins|1997|p=290}}{{sfn|Rotman|2008}} Gombrich objects to calling merit-making "dry metaphysical mercantilism", but he does speculate on a historical relation between the concept of merit and the [[monetization]] of ancient India's economy.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|pp=127–8}}

=== Description and origins ===
Two practices mentioned in the list of meritorious acts have been studied quite extensively by scholars: dedicating (or transferring) merit to others, and rejoicing in others' merits.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=109–10}} Transferring merit is a widespread custom in all Buddhist countries, Mahāyāna, Vajrayāna and Theravāda.&lt;ref name="Schumann 1973"&gt;''Buddhism. An Outline of its Teachings and Schools'' by Schumann, Hans Wolfgang, trans. by Georg Fenerstein, Rider: 1973, p. 92. Cited in "The Notion of Merit in Indian Religions," by Tommi Lehtonen, ''Asian Philosophy'', Vol. 10, No. 3, 2000 pg 193&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=203}}{{sfn|Keyes|1977|p=287}} In the Pāli tradition, the word ''pattidāna'' is used, meaning 'giving of the acquired'.{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980a}} And in the Sanskrit tradition, the word ''pariṇāmanā'' is used for transferring merit, meaning 'bending round or towards, transfer, dedication'.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=472}} Of these translations, 'transfer of merit' has become commonplace, though objected to by some scholars.&lt;ref name="Masefield 2004"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|last=Masefield|first=Peter|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|volume=2|title=Ghosts and spirits|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA, [[Thomson Gale]]|location=New York (u.a.)|isbn=978-0-02-865720-2|pp=309–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=126}}

Buddhist traditions provide detailed descriptions of how this transfer proceeds. Transferring merit to another person, usually deceased relatives, is simply done by a mental wish. Despite the word ''transfer'', the merit of the giver is in no way decreased during such an act, just like a candle used to light another candle does not diminish.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=470}}{{sfn|Pye|Strong|1987|p=5874}}{{sfn|Malalasekera|1967|p=85}} The merit transferred cannot always be received, however. The dead relatives must also be able to sympathize with the meritorious act. If the relatives do not receive the merit, the act of transferring merit will still be beneficial for the giver himself. The transfer of merit is thus connected with the idea of rejoicing.{{sfn|Gombrich|1971|pp=209–10}} The other person who rejoices in one's meritorious deeds, in that way also receives merit, if he approves of the merit done. Thus, rejoicing in others' merits, apart from being one of the ten meritorious acts mentioned, is also a prerequisite for the transferring of merit to occur.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=20}}{{sfn|Malalasekera|1967|p=85}}{{sfn|Harvey|2012|p=45}} The purposes for merit transfer differ. In many Buddhist countries, transferring merit is connected to the notion of an [[intermediate state]]. The merit that is transferred to the deceased will help them to cross over safely to the next rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|last=Cuevas|first=Brian J.|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|volume=2|title=Intermediate state|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA, Thomson Gale|location=New York (u.a.)|isbn=978-0-02-865720-2|p=379}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Mahāyāna traditions believe that it can help deceased relatives to attain the [[Pure Land]].{{sfn|Tanabe|2004|p=532}} Another way of transferring merit, apart from helping the deceased, is to dedicate it to the ''[[deva (Buddhism)|devas]]'' (deities), since it is believed that these are not able to make merits themselves. In this way it is believed their favor can be obtained.&lt;ref name="Langer 2007" /&gt;{{sfn|Harvey|2012|p=45}}{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=36}} Finally, many Buddhists transfer merits to resolve a bond of revenge that may exist between people, as it is believed that someone else's vengefulness may create harm in one's life.{{sfn|Tanabe|2004|p=533}}{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=335}}

Initially in the Western study of Buddhism, some scholars believed that the transfer of merit was a uniquely Mahāyāna practice and that it was developed only at a late period after the historical Buddha. For example, Heinz Bechert dated the Buddhist doctrine of transfer of merit in its fully developed form to the period between the fifth and seventh centuries CE.{{sfn|Bechert|1992|loc=note 34, pp. 99–100}} Scholars perceived that it was discordant with early Buddhist understandings of karma,{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=203}}{{sfn|Bechert|1992|loc=note 34, pp. 99–100}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1971|p=204}} and noticed that in the [[Kathāvatthu]] the idea is partly refuted by Theravādins.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=469}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1971|p=216}} Other scholars have pointed out that the doctrine of the transfer of merit can be found early in the Theravāda tradition.{{sfn|Keyes|1977|p=287}}{{sfn|Egge|2013|p=96}}{{sfn|Malalasekera|1967|p=89}} Then there also scholars who propose that, although the transfer of merit did not exist {{em|as such}} in early Buddhism, early doctrines did form a basis for it, the transfer of merit being an "inherent consequence" (Bechert) of these early doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author-link=Bhikkhu Analayo|date=2010|title=Saccaka's Challenge–A Study of the Saṃyukta-āgama Parallel to the Cūḷasaccaka-sutta in Relation to the Notion of Merit Transfer|url=http://www.chibs.edu.tw/ch_html/chbj/23/Analayo%2039-70.pdf|journal=Chung-Hwa Buddhist Journal|volume=23|pages=60–2|issn=1017-7132|last1=Anālayo|first1=Bhikkhu}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gombrich|1971|p=210}}{{sfn|Bechert|1992|p=105}}

The idea that a certain power could be transferred from one to another was known before the arising of Buddhism. In religious texts such as the [[Mahābhārata]], it is described that ''devas'' can transfer certain powers (''{{lang-sa|tejas}}''). A similar belief existed with regard to the energy gained by [[Asceticism#Indian religions|performing austerities]] (''{{lang-sa|tapas}}''). Apart from these transfers of power, a second origin is found in [[Veneration of the dead#India|Brahamanical ancestor worship]].{{sfn|Pye|Strong|1987|p=5874}} In the period preceding the arising of Buddhism, it was believed that after a person's death he had to be transformed from a wandering ''preta'' to reach the blissful world of the ''pitṛs.'' This was done through the complex ''[[Śrāddha]]'' ceremonies, which would secure the destiny of the deceased as a ''pitṛ''. In Buddhism, however, ancestor worship was discontinued, as it was believed that the dead would not reach heavenly bliss through rituals or worship, but only through the law of karma. Nevertheless, the practice of transfer of merit arose by using the ethical and psychological principles of karma and merit, and connect these with the sense of responsibility towards one's parents. This sense of responsibility was typical for pre-Buddhist practices of ancestor worship. As for the veneration of dead ancestors, this was replaced by veneration of the Sangha.{{sfn|Holt|1981|pp=5–10, 17, 19–20}}{{sfn|Bechert|1992|pp=99–100}}

In South and South-East Asia, merit-making was not only a practice for the mass, but was also practiced by the higher echelons of society. Kingship and merit-making went together.{{sfn|Aung-Thwin|Aung-Thwin|2013|p=84}}{{sfn|Scott|2009|pp=98–102}} In the Tipiṭaka, ideas about good governance were framed in terms of the ideal of the '[[Cakravartin|wheel-turning monarch]]' (''{{lang-pi|Cakkavatti}}''; ''{{lang-sa|Cakravartin}}''), the king who rules righteously and non-violently according to [[Dharma#Eusebeia and dharma|Dharma]].{{sfn|Harvey|2000|pp=114–5}} His roles and duties are discussed extensively in Buddhist texts. The ''Cakkavatti'' is a moral example to the people and possesses enough spiritual merit. It is through this that he earns his sovereignty, as opposed to merely inheriting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.khamkoo.com/uploads/9/0/0/4/9004485/constituting_communities_-_theravada_buddhism_and_the_religious_cultures_of_south_and_southeast_asia.pdf|title=Toward a Theory of Buddhist Queenship|last=Strong|first=John S.|date=2003|encyclopedia=Constituting communities Theravada Buddhism and the religious cultures of South and Southeast Asia|publisher=[[State University of New York Press]]|isbn=978-0-7914-5691-0|location=Albany|page=47|editor1-last=Holt|editor1-first=John Clifford|editor2-last=Kinnard,|editor2-first=Jacob N.|editor3-last=Walters|editor3-first=Jonathan S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=115}}  Also, the Buddha himself was born as a prince, and was also a king (Vessantara) in a previous life.{{sfn|Keyes|1977|p=287}}{{sfn|Rāhula|1966|p=256}}{{sfn|Jory|2002}} Apart from the models in the ''suttas'', Pāli chronicles such as the Mahāvaṃsa and the [[Jinakalamali|Jinakālamālī]] may have contributed to the ideals of Buddhist kingship. In these vernacular Pāli works, examples are given of royalty performing meritorious acts, sometimes as a form of [[repentance]] for previously committed wrongdoings. The emperor [[Ashoka|Asoka]] ({{lang-sa|Aśoka}}) is featured as an important patron supporting the Sangha.{{sfn|Salguero|2013|p=346}}

Because of these traditions, kings have had an important role in maintaining the Sangha, and publicly performed grand acts of merit, as is testified by [[epigraphic]] evidence from South and South-East Asia.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=472}}{{sfn|Scott|2009|pp=98–102}} In Sri Lanka, from the tenth century CE onward, kings have assumed the role of a lay protector of the Sangha, and so have Thai kings, during the [[Sukhothai period|periods of Sukhothai]] and [[Ayutthaya period|Ayutthaya]] (fourteenth until eighteenth centuries). In fact, a number of kings in Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Burma have described themselves as ''Bodhisattas'', and [[epithets]] and [[Thai honorifics#Honorific registers|royal language]] were established accordingly.{{sfn|Aung-Thwin|Aung-Thwin|2013|p=84}}{{sfn|Keyes|1977|p=288}}{{sfn|Jory|2002|p=52}} In short, kingship in traditional Buddhist societies was connected with the Sangha as a field of merit: the king assumed an exemplary role as a donor to the Sangha, and the Sangha legitimated the king as a leader of the state. Both facilitated one another, and both needed each other.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=117}} In times of famine or other hardship, it was traditionally believed that the king was failing, and the king would typically perform meritorious activities on a grand scale.{{sfn|Rotman|2008}}{{sfn|Jory|2002|p=53}}{{sfn|Aung-Thwin|Aung-Thwin|2013|p=183}} In this way the king would be able to improve the kingdom's conditions, through his "overflow karma" (Walters).{{sfn|Walters|2003|p=19}} A similar role was played by queens.&lt;ref name="Holt 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holt|first1=John Clifford|last2=Kinnard,|first2=Jacob N.|last3=Walters|first3=Jonathan S.|title=Constituting communities Theravada Buddhism and the religious cultures of South and Southeast Asia|date=2003|publisher=[[State University of New York Press]]|location=Albany|isbn=978-0-7914-5691-0|page=3|url=http://www.khamkoo.com/uploads/9/0/0/4/9004485/constituting_communities_-_theravada_buddhism_and_the_religious_cultures_of_south_and_southeast_asia.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last seven centuries in Thailand, the Vessantara Jātaka has played a significant role in legitimating kingship in Thailand, through a yearly festival known as the 'Preaching of the Great Life' ({{RTGS|Thet Mahachat}}). Merit-making and ''[[pāramī]]s'' (doing good deeds, developing good habits to become a Buddha) were greatly emphasized in this festival, through the story about Prince Vessantara's generosity. During the reform period of Rama IV, as Thai Buddhism was [[Buddhist modernism|being modernized]], the festival was dismissed as not reflecting true Buddhism. Its popularity has greatly diminished ever since. Nevertheless, the use of merit-making by the Thai monarchy and government, to solidify their position and create unity in society, has continued until the late twentieth century.{{sfn|Jory|2016|pp=20, 181-2}}

=== 19th–early 20th century ===
Buddhists are not in agreement with regard to the interpretation, role, and importance of merit. The role of merit-making in Buddhism has been discussed throughout Buddhist history, but much more so in the last centuries. In the nineteenth century, during the rise of Buddhist modernism and the Communist regimes, Buddhists in South and Southeast Asia became more critical about merit-making when it became associated with magical practices, privileging, [[Ritualization|ritualism]] and waste of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Kleinod|first1=Michael|editor1-last=Athyal|editor1-first=Jesudas M.|encyclopedia=Religion in Southeast Asia: An Encyclopedia of Faiths and Cultures|title=Laos|date=2015|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-61069-250-2|page=152|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-RfYBgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Scott|2009|pp=90–1}}{{sfn|Cate|Lefferts|2006|p=588}}{{Refn|group=note|From the 1980s onward, the communist regimes in Laos and Cambodia no longer viewed Buddhism as an obstacle to the development of the state, and many of the restrictions with regard to Buddhist practice were lifted. {{sfn|Cate|Lefferts|2006|p=590}}{{sfn|Marston|2006|p=169}} In Burma, the former military government approached merit-making practices differently: they justified their [[forced labor camp]]s by citing that the labor there yielded merit. At the same time, [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] referred to the struggle for democracy as ''meritorious''.{{sfn|Calkowski|2006|pp=106–7}}}} In  pre-modern Thailand, a great deal of the funds of temples were derived from the profits of land that were offered to temples by royalty and nobility. During the period of religious reform and administrative centralization in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, however, Thai temples were no longer supported in this manner and had to find other ways to maintain themselves.{{sfn|Fuengfusakul|1998|pp=53-4}}

At the beginning of the twentieth century, perspectives of merit-making had changed again, as merit-making was being associated with [[capitalism]] and [[consumerism]], which had been rising in South and Southeast Asia.{{sfn|Scott|2009|pp=90–1, 126}}{{sfn|Skilling|2005|p=9833}} Furthermore, in some Buddhist countries, such as Thailand, there is a tendency among teachers and practitioners to dismiss and even revile merit-making in favor of teachings about detachment and attaining Nirvana, for which [[L.

=== From 1960s onward ===
Studies done in the 1960s and 1970s in Thailand, Sri Lanka and Burma showed that a great deal of time, effort and money was invested by people in merit-making, e.g. Spiro described Burma's rural economy as "geared to the overriding goal of the accumulation of wealth as a means of acquiring merit". In some studies done in rural Burma, up to thirty percent of people's income was spent on merit-making.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=192}} In 2014, when Burma ranked highest on the [[World Giving Index]] (tied with the United States, and followed by many other Buddhist countries), scholars attributed this to the Burmese habit of merit-making.&lt;ref name="Fuller 2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fuller|first1=Paul|title=The act of giving: what makes Myanmar so charitable?|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/lifestyle/16317-the-act-of-giving-what-makes-myanmar-so-charitable.html|accessdate=13 October 2016|work=[[Myanmar Times]]|date=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cole|first1=Diane|title=You'll Never Guess The Most Charitable Nation In The World|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/11/28/457101304/youll-never-guess-the-most-charitable-nation-in-the-world|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies done in Thailand, however, showed that in the 1980s merit-making was declining, and a significant group did no longer believe in karma—though this was not a majority.{{sfn|Basham|1989|pp=128–9, 133}} Some scholars disagree with these findings, however, saying that Buddhist practices such as merit-making  are still very widespread.{{sfn|Skilling|2005|p=9833}} Similar observations have been made about Cambodia and even about Thai people in the United States.{{sfn|Kent|Chandler|2008|p=13}}{{sfn|Bao|2005}} As for Buddhist "converts" in the west, for example [[Buddhism in the United Kingdom|from the United Kingdom]], the interest in merit is less than among Asian Buddhists, but they strongly appreciate the generosity and reverence as exhibited by Asian Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bell|first1=Sandra|title=British theravada Buddhism: Otherworldly theories, and the theory of exchange|journal=Journal of Contemporary Religion|date=25 June 2008|volume=13|issue=2|page=156|doi=10.1080/13537909808580828}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heine|first1=Steven|last2=Wright|first2=Dale S.|title=Zen ritual : studies of Zen theory in practice|date=2008|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-530467-1|page=64|url=http://terebess.hu/zen/ZenRitual.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discussion by scholars ===
Some scholars have suggested that merit-making may have affected the economies of Buddhist countries in a negative way, because spending savings on the local temple would prevent consumption and investment and therefore stunt economic growth. Other researchers have disagreed, pointing out that spending resources on a Buddhist temple does stimulate economic growth through the investment in goods for the temple.&lt;ref name="KRC 2005" /&gt;{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=193}}{{refn|group=note|Since the 2000s, studies in China have shown a growing interest among local government officials to promote merit-making activities, believing it to stimulate local economy.{{sfn|Fisher|2008|p=152}}}} It has also been suggested that even if the economy of Buddhist countries would be better off without merit-making, it would result in an economy that the majority of the population would not prefer. Another criticism often leveled at merit-making in modern times is that it prevents people from using their resources to help the poor and needy. Very often, however, temples do have many social roles in society, and offer help to many groups in society—resources are therefore redistributed widely.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|pp=193–4}}{{sfn|Fisher|2008|loc=passim.}} Moreover, since merit-making is often done as a community, merit-making may strengthen [[social ties]], which Walters calls "sociokarma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.cubs.chula.ac.th/images/research/58_2/Dhammakaya_Full.pdf|last =Fuengfusakul|first=Apinya|year= 1998| script-title=ศาสนาทัศน์ของชุมชนเมืองสมัยใหม่: ศึกษากรณีวัดพระธรรมกาย|trans-title=Religious Propensity of Urban Communities: A Case Study of Phra Dhammakaya Temple|language=th|publisher=Buddhist Studies Center, [[Chulalongkorn University]]|pages=53, 57}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Harvey|2000|pp=193–4}}{{sfn|Walters|2003|p=3}}

Scholars have often connected the notion of karma to the [[determinism]] in the [[caste system in India]].{{sfn|Hanks|1962|p=1248}} Just like in the case of karma, some scholars believe that a belief in merit can cause social differences to stay unchanged. This would be the case when the poor, who cannot make much merit, resign to their fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:857291/FULLTEXT01.pdf|title=Buddhist Practice in Rural Kandal Province, 1960 and 2003|last=Nissen|first=Christine J.|date=2008|encyclopedia=People of virtue: Reconfiguring religion, power and moral order in Cambodia today|publisher=[[Nordic Centre in Shanghai|NIAS]]|isbn=978-87-7694-036-2|edition=Reprint|location=Copenhagen|page=276|editor1-last=Kent|editor1-first=Alexandra|editor2-last=Chandler|editor2-first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gutschow|2004|p=18}} Other scholars point out that merit can be used to improve social status in the present, as in the case of someone ordaining as a monk for a few years.{{sfn|Keyes|1977|p=287}} And vice versa, if someone's social status quickly deteriorates, for example, due to quick changes in the bureaucratic structure, these changes might be justified in Buddhist societies because someone's store of merit is believed to have run out.{{sfn|Basham|1989|pp=127–8}} Someone's position in society, even in the cosmos, is always subject to the impermanent workings of merit and demerit. In traditional Buddhist societies, quick changes in position, status, or roles are therefore considered part of life, and this insecurity is a motivator in trying to improve the situation through merit-making.{{sfn|Hanks|1962|pp=1247–8, 1252}}{{sfn|Keyes|1973|p=97}} Findly points out that in Buddhist ideals of merit-making, the earned value gained by doing good deeds is more important than the assigned value gained by social status at birth.{{sfn|Findly|2003|pp=261–2}}

&lt;!--"Faith in Buddhism#Millenarianism" links here. Please adjust wikilink over there if this section is (re)moved.--&gt;
The idea of merit is also at the basis of the {{dfn|''Phu Mi Bun''}} movements as has been studied in Thailand and other Buddhist societies. ''Phu Mi Bun'' are people who are considered to have much merit from past lives, whose influence morally affects society at large.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|pp=261–2}}{{sfn|Keyes|1983|p=269}}{{sfn|Mulder|1979|p=117}} ''Phu Mi Bun'' are in many ways similar to people declared ''Bodhisattvas'' in Buddhist societies, and in fact, the word ''Phu Mi Bun'' is often used in traditional Thai texts about the previous lives of the Buddha. Besides the example of the king himself, certain monks and ''[[shamans]]'' have assumed this role throughout history. In Thailand, around the turn of the twentieth century, a [[millennialist]] movement arose regarding the coming of a ''Phu Mi Bun'', to the extent of becoming an insurgency which was suppressed by the government.{{sfn|Keyes|1977|pp=288–90}}{{sfn|Keyes|1973|pp=101–2}}{{sfn|Jory|2002|pp=45-6}} This insurgency became known to Thai historians as the "rebellion of the ''Phu Mi Bun''" ({{RTGS|Kabot Phu Mi bun}}), commonly known in English as the [[Holy Man's Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murdoch|first1=John B.|title=The 1901–1902" Holy Man's" Rebellion|journal=[[Journal of the Siam Society]]|date=1967|volume=5|pages=78–86|url=http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/1971/JSS_062_1e_Murdoch_1901to1902HolyMansRebellion.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of such rebellions involving ''Phu Mi Bun'' have taken place in the history of Thai, Laos, Cambodia and Burma. For example, in Cambodia, there were ''Phu Mi Bun''–led revolts against the [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|French control of Cambodia]].{{sfn|Kent|Chandler|2008|p=5}} Lucien Hanks has shown that beliefs pertaining to ''Phu Mi Bun'' have profoundly affected the way Thai people relate to authority.{{sfn|Hanks|1962}} [[Arthur Llewellyn Basham|Indologist Arthur Basham]], however, believed that in contemporary Thai society the ''Phu Mi Bun'' is more of a label, and ''merit'' more of a secular term than a deeply-rooted belief.{{sfn|Basham|1989|loc=pp. 134–5 n.1}}

=== Merit release ===
{{Main|Life release}}
One merit-making practice that has received more scholarly attention since the 1990s is the practice of "merit release". Merit release is a ritual of releasing animals from captivity, as a way to make merit. Merit release is a practice common in many Buddhist societies, and has since the 2010s made a comeback in some societies.&lt;ref name="Economist 2015" /&gt; Its origins are unclear, but traditionally it is said to originate from the Mahāyāna ''[[Humane King Sutra]]'', among other sources.&lt;ref name="Nuwer 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|date=8 January 2012|title=Buddhist Ceremonial Release of Captive Birds May Harm Wildlife|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/buddhist-ceremonial-release-captive-birds-may-harm-wildlife|journal=[[Scientific American]]|last1=Nuwer|first1=Rachel|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Shiu|Stokes|2008|p=184}} It often involves a large number of animals which are released simultaneously, as well as [[Buddhist chant|chanting]], making a resolution, and transfer of merits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Severinghaus|first1=Lucia Liu|last2=Chi|first2=Li|title=Prayer animal release in Taiwan|journal=Biological Conservation|date=1999|volume=89|issue=3|page=301|doi=10.1016/S0006-3207(98)00155-4|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320798001554}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Shiu|Stokes|2008|p=186}} Though the most common practice is the releasing of fish and birds back in nature, there are also other forms: in Tibet, animals are bought from the slaughterhouse to release.{{sfn|Darlington|2016|time=25}} However, the practice has come under criticism by wildlife [[conservationists]] and scholars. Studies done in Cambodia, Hong Kong and Taiwan have shown that the practice may not only be fatal for a high percentage of the released animals, but may also affect the survival of [[threatened species]], create a black market for wildlife, as well as pose a threat for public hygiene.&lt;ref name="Nuwer 2012" /&gt;{{sfn|Darlington|2016|time=30}} Some Buddhist organizations have responded to this by adjusting their practices, by working together with conservationist organizations to educate people, and even by pushing for new laws controlling the practice.{{sfn|Darlington|2016|time=29,32–33}} {{as of|2016|alt=In 2016}}, the [[Society for Conservation Biology]] (SCB) started discussing possible solutions with religious communities on how the practice could be adapted. According to the SCB, the communities have generally responded positively.&lt;ref name="Nuwer 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religion and Conservation Biology|url=http://conbio.org/groups/working-groups/religion-and-conservation-biology|website=conbio.org|publisher=Society for Conservation Biology|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, in some countries, laws have been issued to control the practice. In Singapore, to limit merit release on [[Vesak]] celebrations, people were fined.{{sfn|Shiu|Stokes|2008|p=184}}

Despite its critics, merit release continues to grow, and has also developed new forms in western countries. In 2016, it was widely reported that the Canada-based Great Enlightenment Buddhist Institute Society (GEBIS) had released {{convert|600|lbs|kg}} of lobsters in the ocean. The release was planned in agreement with local lobster-men.&lt;ref name="Ross 2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ross|first1=Shane|title=P.E.I. monks buy 600&amp;nbsp;lbs of lobster to release them into ocean|url=http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-monks-free-lobsters-1.3672032|accessdate=17 October 2016|work=[[CBC News]]|agency=[[CBC/Radio-Canada]]|date=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Wendy Cook from Lincoln, United States, bought fourteen rabbits from a farm to raise them under better conditions. The costly release, advertised on Facebook as ''The Great Rabbit Liberation of 2016'', was supported by Buddhist monastics from Singapore and the Tibetan tradition, and was based on the idea of merit-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wangsness|first1=Lisa|title=The great rabbit pardon of 2016|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/09/17/the-great-rabbit-pardon/O4cv6vYM9ssmB3o0BRQRxK/story.html|accessdate=17 October 2016|work=[[Boston Globe]]|date=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a less successful attempt, two Taiwanese Buddhists released crab and lobsters in the sea at [[Brighton]], United Kingdom, to make merit. They were fined by the authorities for £15,000 for a wildlife offense that could have significant impact on native species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two Buddhists fined £15,000 for releasing crustaceans into sea|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/23/two-buddhists-fined-15000-releasing-non-native-crustaceans-sea-brighton|accessdate=20 November 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Modus vivendi''''' is a [[Latin]] phrase that means "mode of living" or “way of life”.  It often is used to mean an arrangement or agreement that allows conflicting parties to coexist in peace. In science it is used to describe [[Habit_(biology)#Behavior|lifestyles]].&lt;ref name="Stevenson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angus Stevenson|title=Oxford Dictionary of English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=anecAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1139|date=19 August 2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-957112-3|pages=1139–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Modus'' means "mode", "way", "method", or "manner". ''Vivendi'' means "of living". The phrase is often used to describe informal and temporary arrangements in political affairs. For example, if two sides reach a ''modus vivendi'' regarding disputed territories, despite political, historical or cultural incompatibilities, an accommodation of their respective differences is established for the sake of contingency.

In diplomacy, a ''modus vivendi'' is an instrument for establishing an international accord of a temporary or provisional nature, intended to be replaced by a more substantial and thorough agreement, such as a [[treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/Overview.aspx?path=overview/definition/page1_en.xml#modus | title=United Nations Treaty Collection: Definitions | accessdate=19 May 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520185430/https://treaties.un.org/Pages/Overview.aspx?path=overview%2Fdefinition%2Fpage1_en.xml#modus | archivedate=20 May 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Armistice]]s and instruments of [[surrender (military)|surrender]] are intended to achieve a ''modus vivendi''.

==Examples==
In Season 1, Episode 25, of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'', entitled "[[The Devil in the Dark]]", Captain [[James T. Kirk]] used the term to describe a possible relationship between miners on a Federation planet and a rock tunneling indigenous species called '[[The Horta]]'. He said, "Seems to me we could make an agreement, reach a ''modus vivendi''. They tunnel, you collect and process, and your processing operation would be a thousand times more profitable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NBC Nightly News With Lester Holt |publisher=NBC |date=November 21, 2016 |url=https://archive.org/details/WRAL_20161121_233000_NBC_Nightly_News_With_Lester_Holt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27686">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Mount Laurel'' doctrine}}
The '''''[[Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey|Mount Laurel]]'' doctrine''' is a controversial judicial interpretation of the [[New Jersey State Constitution]]. The doctrine requires that municipalities use their [[zoning]] powers in an affirmative manner to provide a realistic opportunity for the production of housing affordable to low and moderate income households.

The doctrine takes its name from the lead case in which it was first pronounced by the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] in 1975: ''Southern Burlington County N.A.A.C.P. v. Mount Laurel Township'' (commonly called ''Mount Laurel I''), in which the plaintiffs challenged the zoning ordinance of [[Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey]], on the grounds that it operated to exclude low and moderate income persons from obtaining housing in the municipality.

==History==

===Initial development===

After the decision in ''Mount Laurel I'', suits were filed against numerous municipalities. The plaintiffs in such suits fell into three classes: lower income persons who actually sought housing and advocacy organizations on their behalf; the New Jersey Public Advocate; and builders who sought to construct developments containing affordable housing.

These early exclusionary zoning suits were beset by numerous difficulties and little, if any, affordable housing resulted. In 1983 appeals in several of these cases (of which ''Southern Burlington County N.A.A.C.P. v. Mount Laurel Township'' was again the lead case), gave the New Jersey Supreme Court the opportunity to reaffirm and tweak the ''Mount Laurel'' Doctrine and provide several mechanisms and remedies to make the doctrine more effective.

===1980s legislative reaction===

The New Jersey Supreme Court was aware that the ''Mount Laurel II'' decision would be controversial and would engender debate about the proper role of the courts. The opinion invited legislative action to implement what the court defined as the constitutional obligation.

In 1985 the [[New Jersey Legislature]] responded by passing the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060824154325/http://www.state.nj.us/dca/coah/fha.shtml Fair Housing Act]. Accepting the premise that there was some constitutional obligation for municipalities to foster some degree of affordable housing, this legislation created an administrative agency, the [[Council on Affordable Housing]] (COAH), to establish regulations whereby the obligation of each municipality in terms of the number of units and how the obligation could be satisfied.

A municipality which elected to participate in COAH's administrative process prior to being sued was provided with protection from litigation and especially the builder's remedy. As a transitional provision, the act provided that municipalities involved in litigation when the act was passed were to be able to transfer the litigation to COAH unless manifest injustice would result.

COAH developed regulations under which the specific number of affordable units that each municipality would be required to provide (its "pre-credited need") could be determined. Participating municipalities developed compliance plans to address this need by such means as the application of credits (''e.g.'' filtering, spontaneous rehabilitation, extra credit for rental units), the use of regional contribution agreements (transferring part of the obligation to a willing municipality, usually an urban center, in the same region along with payment in an amount agreed by the municipalities) and zoning for affordable housing (usually involving increased density and mandatory set-asides). When COAH approved a municipality's compliance plan it would grant "substantive certification" which was designed to provide the municipality with protection from exclusionary zoning litigation.

From the municipal point of view, the advantages of COAH's administrative process included the use of a formula to calculate fair share that might produce a lower obligation than the court would impose, the availability of the regional contribution agreement to reduce the number of units and the ability to determine where in the municipality that affordable housing ought to be developed rather than being forced to permit a development as a reward to a successful builder-plaintiff. Those municipalities that chose not to participate in COAH's administrative process remained vulnerable to exclusionary zoning lawsuits and the prospect of the builder's remedy. The disadvantage would be that a participating municipality might be required to zone some land in a manner that extra housing would be produced. Some municipalities, believing that the likelihood of facing an actual exclusionary zoning lawsuit was low enough, took their chances in not participating.

===Criticism of the decision===
While the Mount Laurel decision mandates a state constitutional obligation for every municipality in a "growth area" to provide a fair share of its region's present and prospective housing needs for low and moderate income families, there is no funding source specified for low or very-low income families, in a state that already has some of the nation's highest property taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicsnj.com/mchose-says-fair-housing-bill-misses-mark-doesnt-address-why-housing-unaffordable-new-jersey-9290 "McHose Says 'Fair Housing' Bill Misses the Mark; Doesn't Address Why Housing is Unaffordable in New Jersey"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027212202/http://www.politicsnj.com/mchose-says-fair-housing-bill-misses-mark-doesnt-address-why-housing-unaffordable-new-jersey-9290 |date=2007-10-27 }}, [[Alison Littell McHose]] press release dated June 11, 2007 on PoliticsNJ.com. Accessed June 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some have accused the decision for being an example of [[judicial activism]].&lt;ref&gt;Editorial. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE2DF123AF937A15751C0A960948260 "Judicial Duty in New Jersey"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 24, 1986. Accessed June 22, 2007. "For 11 years, New Jersey's Supreme Court has struggled with the constitutional issues implicit in the desire of Mount Laurel, a Burlington County township, to zone out low-income housing. For its labor the court earned its share of criticism for ''judicial activism.'' Last week, it yielded supervision of housing to a new state agency, the [[Council on Affordable Housing]]. That was no defeat for judicial activism but a handsome vindication of it."&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s judicial response to the Fair Housing Act===

The New Jersey Supreme Court welcomed the Legislature's adoption of the Fair Housing Act. A number of trial court decisions had denied transfer of pending cases to COAH under the manifest injustice standard, but the Supreme Court read that term very narrowly and ordered the cases transferred. The trial courts were directed to conform their rulings with regard to calculation of each municipality's obligation and how to meet it to COAH's regulations and the statute was found facially constitutional and interpreted to grant COAH ample authority, such as restraining the use of scarce resources (sewer capacity, potable water, land) for other than providing affordable housing, to assure that affordable housing might actually be built.

==The Council on Affordable Housing (COAH)==

COAH is a currently defunct government agency created in the 1980s to administer Mt. Laurel requirements. Some have argued it needs reinvigoration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/15/07/21/explainer-coming-to-terms-with-the-intricacies-of-fair-housing-after-coah/&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Fair Share Housing Center==
The Fair Share Housing Center, or FSHC, is a Cherry Hill-based nonprofit organization founded in 1975 that litigates against towns in enforcement of fair housing development.&lt;ref&gt;Behind the Fund for New Jersey's Support of a Housing Rights Group https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/housing/2014/10/7/behind-the-fund-for-new-jerseys-support-of-a-housing-rights.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Some have alleged that the FSHC has "ties to developers."&lt;ref&gt;We must stop the affordable housing crisis https://njersy.co/2qut45a via @northjersey&lt;/ref&gt;

==Builder's remedy lawsuits==
A "builder's remedy lawsuit" is a New Jersey lawsuit filed by a real estate developer in an attempt to force a New Jersey town to allow the construction of a large, multi-family housing complex that includes some affordable housing alongside ordinary apartments.

Usually, the developer's court papers will make specific mention of the Mt. Laurel doctrine, which holds municipalities responsible for providing affordable housing to low and moderate income households. Some have argued that developers exploit the Mount Laurel doctrine with the builder's remedy and prevent town efforts to combat overdevelopment and sprawl.&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey's Housing Law Works Too Well, Some Say https://nyti.ms/2uKoAZx&lt;/ref&gt; Some recent "builder's remedy" lawsuits or related concerns include:

*Bridgewater.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tapinto.net/articles/k-hovnanian-proposes-townhome-development-off-ro&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cranford.

Hekemian Group, a Paramus-based builder of apartment complexes. And there is nothing anyone can do about it. It is a court order based on what they refer to as builder remedy litigation. Apparently, progress is only found in concrete."&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.nj.com/njv_brian_campbell/2013/03/cranford_-_a_town_is_citified.html&lt;/ref&gt;

*Millburn.

*Montvale. The S. Hekemian Group filed to intervene in Montvale's affordable-housing litigation to build 1,000 units, arguing the borough "is in violation of its constitutional duty to create sufficient realistic opportunities" for affordable housing. In June 2017, Mayor Mike Ghassali stated, "Now we are on a path to spend untold amounts of time, money and borough resources to defend our town from a monstrous development that would change our community forever" regarding the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/montvale/2017/06/30/developer-seeks-build-1-000-housing-units-montvale-property/442753001/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/montvale/2017/04/20/montvale-seeks-best-outcome-affordable-housing-plan/100616524/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the Fair Housing Act created the now-repealed Regional Contribution Agreement system.  The RCAs meant that towns could pay to get out of up to half of their affordable housing obligation by funding affordable housing elsewhere as required by the New Jersey Supreme Court's Mt. Laurel decision.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.njfuture.org/2007/01/31/rcas-regional-contribution-agreements/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, at the behest of the Fair Share Housing Center's Peter O' Connor and over the objections of some suburban Democrats, Governor Corzine signed a law barring RCAs. A500. He signed A-500 into law during a ceremony at Fair Share Housing Development's Ethel R. Lawrence Homes.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.nj.com/njv_john_atlas/2008/07/new_jersey_regional_coalition.html&lt;  ftp://www.njleg.state.nj.us/20082009/A0500/500_U1.HTM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.app.com/story/opinion/columnists/2017/05/26/nj-gubernatorial-primary-guadagno-ciattarelli/102188626/&lt;/ref&gt;  Some have demanded that RCAs be returned to cut down on sprawl.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northjersey.com/story/opinion/readers/2017/05/23/letter-bring-back-rcas-affordable-housing/337819001/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newjerseyconferenceofmayors.com/magazine/winter_2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental concerns==

In 1983, the NJ Supreme Court cautioned that, in requiring affordable housing, our State Constitution "does not require bad planning.  It does not require suburban spread.  It does not require rural municipalities to encourage large scale housing developments.  It does not require wasteful extension of roads and needless construction of sewer and water facilities for the out-migration of people from the cities and the suburbs.  There is nothing in our Constitution that says that we cannot satisfy our constitutional obligation to provide lower income housing and, at the same time, plan the future of the state intelligently."&lt;ref&gt;Southern Burlington County, et al. v. Township of Mount Laurel, et al., 92 N.J. 158, 238 (1983) (Mt Laurel II).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Some commentators have denounced the environmental impact of the current regime. As the result of one successful builder's remedy lawsuit brought by S. Hekemian Group, developers may construct a 360-unit, high density housing development in [[Cranford, New Jersey]] next to a flood plain. Some assert such developments could worsen flooding in an already flood-prone area that was ravaged by [[Hurricane Irene]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Mulshine, State Wants to Flood Cranford with High-Density Housing, THE STAR-LEDGER, September 7, 2011, http://blog.nj.com/njv_paul_mulshine/2011/09/state_wants_to_flood_cranford.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Other New Jersey residents assert they fear sprawl, the destruction of historic New Jersey small town architecture, and crowding: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;As an environmental scientist, I am concerned with the question of how many residents can be sustained before we reach an environmental tipping point. When do our water systems fail to provide the supply needed (remember the Bergen County dire drought warning last October?); when does the volume of traffic finally overwhelm our existing roadways and extend commuting times to impossible limits (remember the last time you sat in local traffic?); when does the air quality become too unhealthy to breath (remember the ozone and poor air-quality alerts just last month?); how many people can actually be sustained with a reasonable quality of life within our municipalities, counties and state?&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northjersey.com/story/opinion/readers/2017/06/22/letter-schepisi-leads-important-discussion-housing/417571001/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One Parsippany resident stated, "I'm very frustrated that this significant tract of undeveloped land is being razed for development when so much property in Parsippany lies vacant," said Dave Kaplan, of the Stop the Overdevelopment at Waterview opposition group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailyrecord.com/story/news/2017/07/06/controversial-whole-foods-project-breaks-ground-parsippany/455311001/&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club applauded Christie's efforts to reform affordable housing law in 2010: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The current COAH law has had a bigger impact on land use and development than any other law in New Jersey's history. The Sierra Club strongly supports a requirement for affordable housing. As towns grow, they must provide a fair share of it. But the need for affordable housing should not undermine the environmental protections given to wetlands, flood plains, steep slopes, stream buffers that protect water supplies, ocean-fronts, and endangered species habitat. And no homes should be built where water supply is at critically low levels. Furthermore, new housing should be located where jobs are, to reduce the carbon footprints and pollution associated with automobile commuting.&lt;ref&gt;Environment Essential in Affordable Housing Review.http://www.sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/sce/new-jersey-chapter/njs_sierran/Sierran_10B.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Present-day demands for legislative reform==
Some believe the NJ Supreme Court seeks legislative action to implement the Mount Laurel doctrine based on recent rulings, as of mid-2017:

=== January 2017 NJ Supreme Court decision ===
In January 2017, the NJ Supreme Court issued a ruling stating that towns had to consider any historic failure to provide affordable housing.  As one commentator put it, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;This case resolved affordable housing regulation debates that have been ongoing since 1999. However, the Court provided no guidance on the method of implementation of affordable housing accommodations that it now requires of municipalities. This decision leaves numerous unanswered questions and it will depend heavily on the Legislature to issue reform of affordable housing requirements. This decision requires implementation of affordable housing accommodations into township plans that have not otherwise considered them since 1999. It is likely that the open spaces in towns will now be filled with affordable housing units, which will bring an influx of population to municipalities. ...We will need to watch the Legislature to see how and if it will alter the current affordable housing regulations to comply with the Court's recent ruling.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawgapc.com/blog/affordable-housing-in-new-jersey/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MaryAnn Spoto, N.J. on the hook for thousands more affordable housing units, Supreme Court says http://s.nj.com/SHt7UaT&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jay Cook, Two River Times, http://tworivertimes.com/holmdel-talks-affordable-housing-with-residents/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Katzban, Archive: Confusion over COAH spreads https://njersy.co/2t98Tyn via @northjersey&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Symons, NJ Supreme Court says towns must catch up on affordable housing http://nj1015.com/nj-supreme-court-says-towns-must-catch-up-on-affordable-housing/?trackback=twitter_top @nj1015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In its January 2017 opinion, the NJ Supreme Court welcomed the Legislature to re-approach the affordable housing issue: "We recognize, as we have before, that the Legislature is not foreclosed from considering alternative methods for calculating and assigning a municipal fair share of affordable housing, and to that end, we welcome legislative attention to this important social and economic constitutional matter," Justice LaVecchia wrote.&lt;ref&gt;In re Declaratory Judgment Actions Filed by Various Muns., 446 N.J.Super. 259, 281 (App. Div. 2016), aff'd as modified on other grounds, 227 N.J. 508 (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salvador Rizzo, N.J. Supreme Court: Towns must have affordable housing http://northjersy.news/2k05wks via @northjersey&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislator outcry===
A Morris County Freeholder candidate,  Harding Committeeman Nicolas Platt, proposed in May 2017 that all mayors state-wide conduct a sit-in in Trenton and refuse to leave the statehouse until legislators acted to reduce the overdevelopment impact of the builder's remedy issue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailyrecord.com/story/news/2017/05/30/freeholder-candidate-rallying-mayors-housing-issue/355671001/&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergen and Passaic County Assemblywoman [[Holly Schepisi]] argued in a July 2017 opinion piece that reform was urgently needed: "If built, the number of new homes alone would far exceed all the homes in the entire borough of Manhattan," she stated, calling the issue one of overdevelopment "madness."

In the summer of 2017, Schepisi held the first of several planned public hearing in Paramus with various civic leaders on mandated affordable housing with local mayors and other state assembly members.&lt;ref&gt;Assemblywoman hears mayors concerns on court-mandated affordable housing https://njersy.co/2syG9yI&lt;/ref&gt;

"It is long past time for the Legislature to act, and block [the nonprofit group Fair Share Housing Center] from their objective of destroying our suburban communities," said one mayor at the hearing according to the press. "We really need action. Nobody has done what they need to do."

Schepisi stated she invited the Fair Share Housing Center to attend but received a letter declining an appearance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/2017/06/16/assemblywoman-hears-mayors-concerns-court-mandated-affordable-housing/401538001/;
http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/2017/06/17/affordable-housing-advocates-takes-aim-assemblywoman-over-forum/404679001/&lt;/ref&gt;

In Somerset County, Montgomery Township Mayor Ed Trzaska said the influx of apartment complex development would ruin the rural character of the area, "overwhelm the township's infrastructure, greatly increase property taxes and burden the school system and negatively impact the quality of life in the township."
.&lt;ref&gt;Affordable housing mandate threatens quality of life, mayor says http://s.nj.com/UYpPrLP&lt;/ref&gt;

In Union County, in the summer of 2017, the Clark town council issued a unanimous resolution demanding for the state legislature to take action to reform the affordable housing issue; the mayor stated that otherwise, "Union County will look like Queens in 25 years."&lt;ref&gt;State Legislators: 'Lead or Get Out of the Way' https://www.tapinto.net/towns/clark/articles/clarks-mayor-bonaccorso-to-state-legislators-l&lt;/ref&gt;

In Berkeley Heights in Union County in June 2017, Council President Marc Faecher said he considered the Legislature's failure to act on overdevelopment to be an "abject failure by our state government."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tapinto.net/towns/berkeley-heights/articles/affordable-housing-the-who-what-when-and-why-e&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public outcry==

In June 2018, NJ 101.5 radio host [[Bill Spadea]] advocated for a constitutional amendment to revoke the doctrine, arguing the imposition of unnecessary development increased tax burdens unfairly.&lt;ref&gt;Affordable housing law making NJ un-affordable (Opinion) http://nj1015.com/affordable-house-making-nj-un-affordable-opinion @nj1015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional town partnership approaches==
In the summer of 2017, the mayors of five Bergen County towns announced they were "teaming up to take a regional perspective on affordable housing, in an effort to find reasonable solutions that will protect the integrity of their communities."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/new-jersey/articles/2017-07-08/5-towns-team-up-to-make-progress-on-affordable-housing&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vacant and abandoned properties==

"Owing to its ongoing high rate of residential foreclosures, New Jersey has become known the Land of the Zombie Houses."&lt;ref&gt;https://articles.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2017/07/dont_give_nj_zombie_homes_the_upper_hand_editorial.amp&lt;/ref&gt;
Some have argued that the deluge of abandoned and vacant properties in New Jersey should be taken into account before forced building occurs in less crowded areas.  They have also suggested that the state step up funding for code enforcement to reduce burdens of urban blight on attractive home development, including enforcement on absentee landlords.  The City of Newark is "working with the Urban League to identify vacant or abandoned properties that can be sold to small developers to then sell at cost to residents. About 16 percent of Newark's housing is vacant and the city has a high eviction and foreclosure rate according to a Rutgers report. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2016/02/a_year_later_newark_sweetheart_land_deals_harbor_m.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://urbanomnibus.net/2016/02/why-hasnt-anyone-built-on-newarks-1000-love-lots/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tapinto.net/towns/newark/articles/new-quality-of-life-initiative-will-ramp-up-code&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2018/04/can_newark_be_a_model_city_to_curb_against_gentrif.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Brunswick Picks Committee, Law Firm to Move on Abandoned Houses https://www.tapinto.net/towns/paterson/articles/new-brunswick-picks-committee-law-firm-to-move-o-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayoral Musings: Vacant and Abandoned http://www.snjtoday.com/story/38565358/mayoral-musings-vacant-and-abandoned#.W0d-k2SYxc8.twitter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ever Since The Great Recession, Zombie Houses Have Haunted New Jersey https://n.pr/1UQY1tn&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ever Since The Great Recession, Zombie Houses Have Haunted New Jersey https://n.pr/1UQY1tn&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vacant and afraid: Getting a grip on abandoned homes | Opinion http://s.nj.com/gCDW8TI&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''murder of the Grimes sisters''' is a currently unsolved [[double murder]] dating from December 1956 when two sisters named Barbara and Patricia Grimes—aged 15 and 12 respectively—disappeared while traveling from a [[Brighton Park, Chicago|Brighton Park]] movie theater to their [[McKinley Park, Chicago|McKinley Park]] home. Their disappearance initiated one of the biggest [[missing person]]s investigations in the history of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sixty Years Later, the Case of the Elvis Presley-loving Grimes Sisters' Murders Remains Cold |date=December 24, 2016 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/elvis-presley-loving-grimes-sisters-found-dead-60-years-article-1.2922567 |publisher=New York Daily News |accessdate=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The girls' nude bodies were discovered alongside a deserted road in [[Willow Springs, Illinois|Willow Springs]] on January 22, 1957.

Although the sisters' [[autopsy|autopsy reports]] concluded the two girls had been murdered within five hours of their last confirmed sighting, and that both girls had died of [[Shock (circulatory)|secondary shock]], numerous individuals attested to having seen the girls alive in the weeks between the night of December 28 and the subsequent discovery of their bodies.&lt;ref name=mapquest&gt;{{cite web |title=3634 South Damen Avenue to 4223 South Archer Avenue, Chicago, Illinois |url=http://mapq.st/ZUjCCw |publisher=[[MapQuest]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The murder of the Grimes sisters has been described by authors as a crime which "shattered the innocence" of Chicago.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; This case is also acknowledged as one of the most labor-intensive missing person and murder investigations in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]],&lt;ref name="NBC News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chicago Grimes Sisters' Murders Hit 59 Years Without Answers |date=January 7, 2016 |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/cold-case-spotlight/chicago-grimes-sisters-murders-hit-59-years-without-answers-n486401 |publisher=NBC News |accessdate=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remains one of Chicago's most infamous [[cold case]]s.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-history-cop/2012/12/new-information-on-disappearance-of-grimes-sisters-chicagos-most-infamous-cold-case/|title=New Information on Disappearance of Grimes Sisters: Chicago's Most Infamous Cold Case|first=Ray|last=Johnson|date=December 27, 2012|publisher=|via=chicagonow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
On December 28, 1956, two of the seven&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; children born to Joseph and Lorretta Grimes—sisters Barbara, 15, and Patricia, 12—opted to view a screening of the [[Elvis Presley]] film ''[[Love Me Tender (1956 film)|Love Me Tender]]'' at a [[Brighton Park, Chicago|Brighton]] theater.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;''Crimes of the Centuries: Notorious Crimes, Criminals, and Criminal Trials in American History'' {{ISBN|978-1-610-69594-7}} p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; Both girls have been described as being inseparable sisters,&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; and attentive students at the [[Thomas Kelly High School]] and [[List of schools of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago#Former K-8 schools in Chicago|St. Maurice]] high schools they respectively attended. They are also known to have been devoted fans of Elvis Presley. This particular occasion was the eleventh time the girls had viewed this particular film of Presley's,&lt;ref name="Death and the Maidens"&gt;{{cite news|title=Death and the Maidens |date=March 20, 1997 |url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/death-and-the-maidens/Content?oid=892961 |publisher=Chicago Reader |accessdate=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sisters are known to have left their residence at approximately 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/death-and-the-maidens/Content?oid=892961|title=Death and the Maidens |first=Tamara|last=Shaffer|date=March 20, 1997|publisher=|via=chicagoreader.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; having promised their mother they would be home before midnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sixty Years Later, the Case of the Elvis Presley-loving Grimes Sisters' Murders Remains Cold |date=December 24, 2016 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/elvis-presley-loving-grimes-sisters-found-dead-60-years-article-1.2922567 |publisher=New York Daily News |accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Joseph and Lorretta Grimes had divorced in December 1951. The divorce had been on amicable terms, with all the Grimes children maintaining regular contact with their father.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Brighton Theater was located approximately one-and-a-half miles from the girls' [[McKinley Park, Chicago|McKinley Park]] home,&lt;ref name=mapquest/&gt; and Barbara and Patricia are presumed to have had approximately $2.50 in their possession at the time they left their home, with Barbara having been instructed to keep 50 [[Penny (United States coin)|cents]] of this money in the zipper of her wallet should the two girls opt to view the second screening of this film scheduled to be broadcast at the theater that evening.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown how the sisters actually traveled to the  Brighton Theater on this particular date, although they had invariably either walked or traveled by bus to this destination on previous occasions.

A school friend of Patricia Grimes named Dorothy Weinert would later inform investigators she had been seated behind the girls with her own younger sister during the film, although Weinert and her sister had left the theater at the intermission of the double feature screened at the Brighton Theater that night, at approximately 9:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. As they had done so, Dorothy saw the Grimes sisters queueing to purchase popcorn.{{refn|group=n|Of the $2.50 in the sisters' possession on the night of their disappearance, $1.50 had been intended for the admission fee to the Brighton Theater for both girls; 50 cents had been given for two boxes of popcorn, and the final 50 [[Penny (United States coin)|cents]] had been intended as the fare for the bus ride home for both girls.&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;}} The two had seemed in good spirits, and neither Weinert sister noticed anything untoward in their demeanor.&lt;ref name=CR97/&gt;

Both sisters stayed to view the second screening of ''Love Me Tender'', thus meaning they would be expected to return home at approximately 11:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. When the girls had not arrived home by midnight, their mother, Lorretta, sent their older sister, Theresa (aged 17), and brother Joey (aged 14) to wait by the bus stop located closest to the family home for their arrival.&lt;ref name="Death and the Maidens"/&gt; After three successive buses had driven by without either girl alighting at the designated stop, both siblings returned home. Having by this stage already unsuccessfully contacted the girls' friends in the hope her daughters may be at one of these addresses,&lt;ref name="Chicago Now"&gt;{{cite news|title=Unsolved Chicago Grimes Sisters' Murder is 59 Years Old |date=December 26, 2015 |url=http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-history-cop/2015/12/unsolved-chicago-grimes-sisters-murder-is-59-years-old/ |publisher=Chicago Now |accessdate=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and upon seeing the return of Theresa and Joey to the family home without their sisters, Lorretta Grimes filed missing person reports on her daughters with the [[Chicago Police Department]] at 2:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. on December 29.&lt;ref name=CR97/&gt;

===Investigation===

Police conducted door-to-door canvassing throughout the neighborhood where Barbara and Patricia were last seen, and numerous canals and rivers were [[Dredging|dragged]]. In addition, more than 15,000 flyers were distributed to local homes, and parishioners of the church the sisters attended offered a $1,000 reward for information leading to their whereabouts.&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this co-ordinated investigation into the sisters' disappearance, 300,000 people would be [[Interrogation|interrogated]],&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Haunts: Ghostlore of the Windy City'' {{ISBN|978-0-964-24267-8}} p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; with some 2,000 individuals subjected to serious interrogation pertaining to their potential culpability, although the two arrests and charges brought against individuals who [[confession|confessed]] to the crime subsequently collapsed, with one individual, Edward Benwell, asserting he had been [[coercion|coerced]] into providing a confession due to his being subjected to a prolonged interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chicago Grimes Sisters' Murders Hit 59 Years Without Answers |date=January 7, 2016 |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/cold-case-spotlight/chicago-grimes-sisters-murders-hit-59-years-without-answers-n486401 |publisher=NBC News |accessdate=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these interrogations, confessions, and extensive media appeals producing many reported sightings of the girls, little in the way of hard evidence was yielded, although several teenagers who had been at the Brighton Theater on December 28 did inform investigators they had seen the two girls conversing with, then entering a car driven by a young man whose physical appearance had been similar to that of Elvis Presley.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt; The vehicle described by these eyewitnesses was consistently described as being a [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] model.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Prior to the implementation of this task force, and against vehement protestations to the contrary from the girls' parents, several investigators initially assigned to the case theorized the sisters may either have run away from home&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two Chicago Girls Found Cruelly Slain.

Resultingly, numerous [[allegation|alleged]] sightings of the sisters would be reported to police as late as January 9, and these reports often described either or both of the girls as having been seen in various business establishments.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; These sightings supported several investigators' initial theories the girls had opted to leave home of their own accord.

Theories also abounded that the sisters may possibly have traveled to [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]], to see Elvis Presley in concert,{{refn|group=n|One of many eyewitness reports received by the Chicago Police Department in January 1957 came from an individual who claimed to have seen the girls at a bus station in Elvis Presley's home town; thus leading to the possibility the girls had traveled to [[Tennessee]] to visit their idol.&lt;ref name="Chicago Now"&gt;{{cite news|title=Unsolved Chicago Grimes Sisters' Murder is 59 Years Old |date=December 26, 2015 |url=http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-history-cop/2015/12/unsolved-chicago-grimes-sisters-murder-is-59-years-old/ |publisher=Chicago Now |accessdate=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} or that the sisters had simply left their home of their own volition as a means of emulating Presley's lifestyle.&lt;ref name=elvis/&gt; In the event her daughters had actually been [[kidnapping|kidnapped]], Lorretta Grimes publicly pleaded: "If someone is holding them, please let the girls call me",&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"&gt;{{cite news|title=Grimes Sisters' Deaths, Still Snsolved, Part of Series that Shook City in 1950s |date=January 22, 2012 |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-per-flash-grimes-0122-20120123-story.html |publisher=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding: "I'll forgive them from the bottom of my heart."&lt;ref name="chicagoreader.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Death and the Maidens |date=March 20, 1997 |url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/death-and-the-maidens/Content?oid=892961 |publisher=Chicago Reader |accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Joseph Grimes' initial positive identification of the bodies, over 160 police officers from several [[Chicago metropolitan area|suburban Chicago]] police departments—assisted by numerous local volunteers—&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a search of the crime scene with the additional assistance of the [[Nature reserve|Forest Preserves]].

===Autopsies===
The decedents' autopsies were performed the day following their discovery. These autopsies would be performed by three experienced [[forensic pathology|forensic pathologist]]s who, following a five-hour examination of each body,&lt;ref&gt;''Unsolved Child Murders: Eighteen American Cases, 1956–1998'' {{ISBN|978-1-476-67000-3}} p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; were unable to reach agreement on either a date or a cause of death. These experts did determine via an examination of the sisters' stomach contents (which contained the approximate proportions of the last known meal and subsequent snack the sisters had eaten on the evening of December 28&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} pp. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;) that both sisters had most likely died within approximately five hours of the time they had last been seen alive at the Brighton Theater, thus affixing the most likely time of death in each instance to have been either the late evening of December 28 or  the early morning of December 29.&lt;ref name=CR97/&gt; The cause of death in each case was ruled as being a combination of [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] and [[Hypothermia|exposure]], although each pathologist reached this conclusion via a process of eliminating other causes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceG"/&gt; In addition, these experts concluded that many of the wounds discovered upon the girls' bodies had most likely been inflicted by rodents,&lt;ref name=SPT/&gt; with the actual puncture wounds having most likely been inflicted after death.&lt;ref name="ReferenceI"&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Barbara Grimes autopsy report.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Death certificate]] of Barbara Grimes.]]

No obviously fatal wounds were discovered upon either girl's body, and [[toxicology]] reports revealed that neither girl had been drunk, drugged, or poisoned prior to her death. No items of the sisters' clothing were ever found, although their bodies were described by the pathologists as being markedly clean.&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The autopsies would also discover that Barbara Grimes had likely engaged in sexual intercourse—either [[Consent|consensually]] or [[rape|unconsensually]]—around the time of her death, although no evidence of forcible molestation was found.&lt;ref name="MJ257"/&gt; The official [[death certificate]]s of both Barbara and Patricia would list their [[cause of death]] as being [[murder]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Grimes Sisters Murders - 60 Years Ago |date=December 27, 2016 |url=http://viplocal.com.au/2016/09/20/grimes-sisters-murder/ |publisher=The Local |accessdate=March 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the specific means of which, in both cases, was listed as being "secondary shock" resulting from exposure to low temperatures, which had reduced each girl's [[Thermoregulation|body temperature]] "below the critical level compatible with life."&lt;ref name=SPT&gt;{{cite news|title=Doctors Say Exposure Killed Grimes Sisters|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ISVSAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1751,3632936|accessdate= March 21, 2013|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=February 9, 1957|author=UP}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Although the official [[forensic pathology|pathological]] report attributed the girls' deaths to exposure, in an interview given to the ''News and Courier,'' one of the doctors referred to the deaths as "brutal homicides", adding: "Those girls could not have died [[Death by natural causes|naturally]]."&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Grimes Sisters' Murder: Ray Johnson Wants to Solve Unsolved Deaths of Barbara and Patricia Grimes |date=May 31, 2013 |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/31/grimes-sisters-murder-ray-johnson-solve_n_3366069.html |accessdate=March 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of the coroners to perform the autopsies, Walter McCarron, surmised the sisters' bodies had lain undiscovered behind the guard rail on German Church Road for many days before their eventual discovery, stating that the bodies' markedly preserved condition given the time interval between their disappearance and discovery had been due the frigid temperatures in the weeks prior to January 22, adding that this had been due to recent snowfalls and the frigid climate. McCarron also concluded the girls' bodies had lain undiscovered for more than three weeks because a layer of snow had blanketed the area on January 9, and that this snowfall had rapidly melted in the days immediately prior to their discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two Chicago Girls Found Cruelly Slain: Boys' Murders Similarly Cited |date=January 23, 1957 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=19570123&amp;id=rjVQAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6556,2060691 |accessdate=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these official conclusions, the Chief Investigator for the Cook County Coroner's Office, Harry Glos,&lt;ref name=CT9251&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Brien|first=John|title=Window To Past Crimes - Files Of Ex-coroner Aide May Help Solve Murders|page=1|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-09-25/news/9409250312_1_murder-case-peterson-case-kenneth-hansen|accessdate=March 20, 2013|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=September 25, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; disagreed with the official time of death, later stating to the media there had been numerous "marks of violence on those girls' faces" strongly indicative of their being the recipients of violence as opposed to [[postmortem]] rodent infestation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Glos also contended that a thin layer of ice found encrusted upon the sisters' bodies indicated they had most likely been alive until at least January 7, since only after that date would there have been sufficient snowfall to react with the girls' natural body heat in such a climate and thus create the layer of ice discovered upon their nude bodies in this location. Glos contended this fact proved their bodies had been warm when their bodies had been deposited beside German Church Road, since only after January 7 had there been sufficient snow to create such an ice layer upon and around their bodies.&lt;ref name=CR97/&gt;

In addition to these facts, Glos also stated that both girls had been subjected to sexual assaults throughout their period of captivity, adding that the autopsy conducted upon Patricia Grimes had discovered [[semen]] within the [[Vaginal discharge|vaginal fluid]] swathed from her body, and that curdled milk had also been found in Barbara Grimes' stomach, when she is not known to have drunk milk either at her home or at the cinema on the evening of December 28.&lt;ref name="ReferenceJ"&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official controversies==
The chief investigator of the Cook County coroner's office, Harry Glos, strongly believed an official suspect in the case named Edward Bedwell had been the individual who had committed the sisters' murder. Glos asserted the wound marks noted upon the girls' bodies in their autopsies had neither been adequately investigated or considered. Glos would also further assert his opinion the wounding and assault marks had been evidence that the sisters had been beaten prior to their murder and, in tandem with the evidence of sexual activity, were thus in line with the claims Edward Bedwell provided to investigators in his January 1957 interrogations.{{refn|group=n|Glos would also assert the autopsy reports, in conjunction with circumstantial evidence, unequivocally revealed that both sisters had been held captive for a minimum of 10 days prior to their murder, adding that throughout the period of their captivity, both girls had been subjected to repeated beatings, torture, and sexual assaults.&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;}} Harry Glos would also claim that official investigators had been refusing to disclose these and potentially other lurid details of the case&lt;ref name="ReferenceK"&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; due to a possible desire to protect the girls' reputations and/or spare their mother's feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Grimes Sisters' Deaths, Still Unsolved, Part of Series that Shook City in 1950s |date=January 22, 2012 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-01-22/site/ct-per-flash-grimes-0122-20120123_1_cold-cases-bodies-grimes-sisters |publisher=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=September 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar allegations would be repeated in later years by others, some of whom claimed to have both seen the original case files, and to have interviewed numerous McKinley Park residents who alleged both girls had been in the habit of spending free time outside bars on 36th Street and Archer Avenue, where they regularly persuaded older men to purchase alcoholic drinks inside these premises and deliver the beverages to them outside the premises.&lt;ref name=CR97/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Grimes Sisters' Deaths, Still Unsolved, Part of Series that Shook City in 1950s |date=January 22, 2012 |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-per-flash-grimes-0122-20120123-story.html |publisher=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Glos's insistence that the pathologists had "[taken] the girls off Madison Street and put them into respectability",&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"/&gt; investigators connected to the case continued to insist that there had been no evidence of either girl being disreputable, or the recipient of extreme violence or sexual molestation prior to her death.&lt;ref name="MJ257"&gt;{{cite news|author=UP|title=Grimes Case Tiff Costs Job - Coroner's Aide Backed by Detective Chief, but Is Fired|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19570216&amp;id=IDEaAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7201,15952|accessdate=March 20, 2013|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=February 16, 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After refusing to retract his statements, Glos was fired by Coroner Walter E.

==Sightings==
Between the last confirmed sighting of the sisters at the Brighton Theater on December 28, 1956, and the subsequent discovery of their bodies 25 days later, several unconfirmed sightings of the girls both in and outside the City of Chicago were reported to the Chicago Police Department.&lt;ref name=CR97/&gt; The most widely reported sightings include the following:

* Numerous people stated to investigators they had seen the girls boarding a [[Chicago Transit Authority]] bus on Archer Avenue heading east into the city after the screening. Those to report this sighting to police included the bus driver. The sisters [[allegation|allegedly]] alighted this bus at Western Avenue, approximately halfway between the theater and their home, at approximately 11:05&amp;nbsp;p.m. Why the sisters would alight the bus at Western Avenue is unknown.&lt;ref name="https"&gt;{{cite news|title=Death and the Maidens |date=February 20, 1997 |url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/death-and-the-maidens/Content?oid=892961 |publisher=Chicago Reader |accessdate=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Investigators would question the accuracy of at least part of this sighting due to the fact the bus driver would state he believed he had heard the sisters mentioning their intention to board an oncoming northbound Western Avenue trolley, which traveled in the direction opposite their home.&lt;ref name="ReferenceL"&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* A young man named Roger Menard informed investigators he had also attended the screening of ''Love me Tender'' on the evening of December 28, having sat behind Barbara and Patricia Grimes and close to Dorothy Weinert. According to Menard, he had left the theater approximately one minute before the Grimes sisters, and the two girls had walked down Archer Avenue a short distance behind him before a "late model, green [[Buick]]" had stopped alongside them. The two girls hesitated, before continuing walking. Just past 42nd Street, with the sisters by this stage walking ahead of him, a black [[Mercury Eight#1949–1951|1949 Mercury]] occupied by two teenage boys pulled alongside the girls, although the sisters simply giggled before continuing walking in the direction of their home.&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} pp. 77-79&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two teenage boys named Ed Lorden and Earl Zastro informed investigators that while they had been driving through McKinley Park at approximately 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on December 28, they had seen the sisters on 35th Street. Reportedly, the two had been "giggling and jumping out of doorways at each other" near Seely and Damen Avenues, with one youth exclaiming to the other the two were "those two Grimes sisters" as they passed them. At this point the girls would have been approximately two blocks from their home.
* A security guard named Jack Franklin later informed investigators he had offered directions to two girls on the morning of December 29, approximately 12 hours after they had left the theater. This verbal exchange had allegedly occurred near Lawrence and Central Park Avenues, and Franklin later concluded the girls had been the Grimes sisters, adding the sole reason he had recalled this conversation was that both girls had been both rude and abrupt to him.
* On the same date of Franklin's alleged sighting of Barbara and Patricia, a friend of Barbara's named Judy Burrow reported to investigators she had seen the sisters at approximately 2:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., walking westward on Archer Avenue (two blocks from Damen Avenue).&lt;ref name="ReferenceL"&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Patricia_Grimes_Autopsy_report.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Death certificate of Patricia Grimes.]]

* A classmate of Patricia Grimes named Catherine Borak was adamant she had seen Patricia walking past a restaurant she (Borak) had been inside in the early evening of December 29. According to Borak, Patricia had been in the company of two unidentified young girls. This sighting was followed by another, six hours later, by a cashier at the Clark Theater in downtown Chicago, who claimed she had seen both girls at 12:45&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name="https"/&gt;
* A railroad conductor named Bernard Norton reported seeing the two girls aboard a train near the Great Lakes Naval Training Center in north suburban [[Glenview, Cook County, Illinois|Glenview]]. According to Norton, the two girls had been searching for two sailors named "Terry" and "Larry."&lt;ref name="ReferenceL"&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;
* On December 30 at 5:40 am, the owner of the D&amp;L Restaurant at 1340 West Madison said he had seen both girls, with Patricia apparently too drunk or sick to walk without staggering, accompanied by an official suspect named Edward Bedwell. This location was over five-and-a-half miles from the Brighton Theater.&lt;ref name=MQDL&gt;{{cite web|title=4223 South Archer Avenue to 1340 West Madison, Chicago, IL|url=http://mapq.st/ZLsagy|publisher=mapquest}}&lt;/ref&gt; A clerk at the Claremont Hotel, after viewing the bodies at a mortuary, likewise identified the sisters as having checked into the hotel on this date.&lt;ref name=MDN126&gt;{{cite news|title=Suspect In Chicago Murders Admits, Then Denies Crime|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gJpCAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5268,1111939|accessdate=March 21, 2013|newspaper=Middlesboro Daily News|date=January 26, 1957|author=UP}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On January 1, 1957, the girls were reported as having been seen aboard a Chicago Transit Authority bus on Damen Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;''True Crime: Illinois: The State's Most Notorious Criminal Cases'' {{ISBN|978-0-811-73562-9}} p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;
* The following week, a night clerk at the Unity Hotel on West 61st street refused two girls a room because of their age. This clerk believed the girls in question had been the Grimes sisters.
* On January 3, three employees at an [[Englewood, Chicago|Englewood]]&lt;ref name="chicagoreader.com"/&gt; Kresge department store claimed to have seen both girls listening to music at the store's record counter. Each employee stated the sisters had been listening to music by Elvis Presley.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;
* Adding credence to the theory that both sisters had run away to Nashville, on January 17, a woman named Pearl Neville contacted investigators to state she had met both girls in a restroom in this location on January 9, and that she had accompanied them to a state employment agency to search for work. According to Neville, both girls had been in what she described as being a "tired, bedraggled" condition. A clerk at this agency would later identify the sisters from photographs, also recalling that both girls had used the surname "Grimes" in the application forms they had populated.&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the early hours of January 14, the parents of a classmate of Patricia Grimes named Sandra Tollstan received two separate, anonymous telephone calls. During the first call, nobody at the other end spoke. Picking up the second phone call approximately 15 minutes later, Sandra's mother, Ann, heard a "frightened and depressed" young female voice asking, "Is that you, Sandra? Is Sandra there?" Before Ann could bring her daughter to the phone, the call had been terminated. Mrs. Tollstan informed investigators of her conviction that the caller had been Patricia Grimes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Bedwell was a tall individual who allegedly bore a strong resemblance to Elvis Presley.&lt;ref name="SPT12857" /&gt; According to John and Minnie Duros (the owners of the restaurant where Bedwell had been employed), he and another young male had been at her premises in the company of two girls who physically resembled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Unsolved Chicago Grimes Sisters' Murder is 59 Years Old |date=December 26, 2015 |url=http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-history-cop/2015/12/unsolved-chicago-grimes-sisters-murder-is-59-years-old/ |publisher=Chicago Now |accessdate=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Grimes sisters in the early morning of December 30.&lt;ref&gt;''True Crime: Illinois: The State's Most Notorious Criminal Cases'' {{ISBN|978-0-811-73562-9}} p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; Duros conveyed this information to police on January 24.

Initially, Bedwell was insistent that John and Minnie Duros and a patron named Rene Echols (who had [[corroborating evidence|corroborated]] the Duros's eyewitness statements) were mistaken in their identification of the girls he had been in the company of on December 30, although he was formally charged with the sisters' murders on January 27, 1957, having signed a 14-page confession in which he claimed that he (Bedwell) and a 28-year-old acquaintance of his named William Cole Willingham&lt;ref name="ReferenceH"&gt;''Crimes of the Centuries: Notorious Crimes, Criminals, and Criminal Trials in American History'' {{ISBN|978-1-610-69594-7}} p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; had indeed been in the company of the Grimes sisters on December 30, having also retained their company until January 7—typically drinking in various West Madison Street skid row saloons.&lt;ref name=MJ12857&gt;{{cite news|title=Bedwell Charged in Sister Slayings|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xyMoAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6699,3570982|accessdate=March 21, 2013|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=January 28, 1957|author=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bedwell, after several days in the girls' willing company, shortly after he and his companion had fed the sisters hot dogs,&lt;ref name=SPT12857p1&gt;{{cite news|title=Skid Row Drifter Says He and Crony Tossed 2 Sisters Out of Car (page 1)|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FRxSAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3776,5896143|accessdate=April 28, 2013|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=January 28, 1957|author=AP}}&lt;/ref&gt; they had extensively beaten both girls, before throwing their nude bodies into a snow-filled ditch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Grimes Case: Another Chapter to Grim Story |date=January 28, 1957 |url=http://www.pantagraph.com/the-grimes-sisters-dec/article_6d693a7a-52bd-11e5-a1b3-3fd833c3ae00.html|publisher=pantagraph.com |accessdate=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; when both sisters had refused their sexual advances.&lt;ref name="nbcnews.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chicago Grimes Sisters' Murders Hit 59 Years Without Answers |date=January 7, 2016 |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/cold-case-spotlight/chicago-grimes-sisters-murders-hit-59-years-without-answers-n486401 |publisher=NBC News |accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon reading Bedwell's confession, Lorretta Grimes was quoted upon as stating: "It's a lie.

The autopsy reports upon both girls also supported Bedwell's recantation, as no alcohol or hot dogs were found in either victim's blood or digestive systems,&lt;ref name=NAC2957&gt;{{cite news|last=Gavzer|first=Bernard|title=Pathology Report Says Grimes Girls Died Of Exposure|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WZxJAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1837,1390404|accessdate=April 2, 2013|newspaper=The News and Courier|date=February 9, 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor had the girls been beaten to death.&lt;ref name=SPT /&gt; Furthermore, Bedwell is also known to have clocked in at Ajax Consolidated Company, his place of employment, from 4:19&amp;nbsp;p.m. on December 28, 1956, to 12:30 am on December 29, covering the time period of the sisters' most likely abduction,&lt;ref name=MGC55/&gt; with further records confirming Bedwell had been working in [[Cicero, Illinois|Cicero]] on the date he claimed to have murdered them. On February 6, Bedwell was freed on a $20,000 bond paid for by an individual from [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]].{{refn|group=n|All charges filed against Bedwell would be officially dropped on March 4&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; due to the numerous inconsistencies in his confession in relation to the [[real evidence|physical]] and [[circumstantial evidence]] obtained and determined. Furthermore, Bedwell was officially classified as being a mentally retarded individual.&lt;ref name="ReferenceH"&gt;''Crimes of the Centuries: Notorious Crimes, Criminals, and Criminal Trials in American History'' {{ISBN|978-1-610-69594-7}} p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Max Fleig===
Max Fleig was a 17-year-old suspect in the sisters' murders. Initially considered one of the prime suspects, due to his age, Fleig was protected by contemporary [[Law of Illinois|Illinois law]]s which prevented juveniles from subjection to [[polygraph|polygraph test]]s. Nonetheless, Chicago Police Captain Ralph Petacque persuaded the teenager to submit to an unofficial polygraph test,&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt; which Fleig voluntarily undertook.&lt;ref name="ReferenceO"&gt;''True Crime: Illinois: The State's Most Notorious Criminal Cases'' {{ISBN|978-0-811-73562-9}} pp. 106-107&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of this unofficial polygraph test, Fleig allegedly confessed to the murders.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Haunts: Ghostlore of the Windy City'' {{ISBN|0-96424-269-9}} p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; With no legal means of using this test as evidence against Fleig,&lt;ref name="ReferenceP"&gt;''True Crime: Illinois: The State's Most Notorious Criminal Cases'' {{ISBN|978-0-811-73562-9}} p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; police were forced to release him without charge.&lt;ref name="ReferenceO"/&gt;

In addition, police were unable to charge Fleig with the murders due to there being a lack of [[real evidence|physical evidence]] corroborating his unofficial polygraph confession that he had kidnapped and subsequently killed the sisters.{{refn|group=n|When Lorretta Grimes was informed that [[Law of Illinois|Illinois law]] prohibited juveniles from subjection to [[polygraph|polygraph test]]ing, she praised police efforts to persuade Fleig to submit to an unofficial polygraph test, but publicly slated the Law of Illinois which protected an alleged murderer simply due to his age.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Haunts: Ghostlore of the Windy City'' {{ISBN|0-96424-269-9}} pp. 141-142&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fleig was later jailed for the unrelated murder of a young woman.&lt;ref name="ReferenceP"/&gt;

===Walter Kranz===
Walter Kranz, a 53-year-old [[pipefitter|steamfitter]] and self-proclaimed [[psychic]], phoned a switchboard operator at Chicago's central police complaint room on January 15 to inform the operator of his conviction that both sisters were deceased and that their bodies could be found in an unincorporated area of [[Lyons Township, Cook County, Illinois|Lyons Township]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceP"/&gt; Kranz refused to disclose his name to the operator in this phone call, simply stating that he had experienced this [[revelation]] in a dream, before terminating the call. Nonetheless, the operator was able to trace the call to a location close to his home.&lt;ref name="chicagoreader.com"/&gt;

The park described by Kranz in his telephone call would prove to be approximately one mile from the true location where the girls' bodies would be just found one week later.&lt;ref name=MN12367&gt;{{cite news|title=Wide Hunt Opened For Girls' Slayers|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=J7YyAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1863,3081816|accessdate=March 21, 2013|newspaper=The Miami News|date=January 23, 1957|author=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned, Kranz informed police that several members of his family and ancestors possessed psychic powers,&lt;ref name=MGC55/&gt; and that he had experienced this particular vision after a night of heavy drinking.&lt;ref name="ReferenceI"/&gt;

Although initially considered by police to be their "number one suspect" in the murders,&lt;ref name="The Cincinnati Enquirer"/&gt; and with handwriting experts also determining he may have written a [[ransom note]] received by the girls' mother prior to the discovery of her daughters' bodies, Kranz denied any involvement in the sisters' abduction and murder. After being subjected to multiple interrogations, he was released.

==Aftermath==
In the weeks between the disappearance and subsequent discovery of her daughters' bodies, Lorretta Grimes was unable to work and thus earn money to raise her children and pay the mortgage upon her home. Friends and neighbors of the Grimes family—plus classmates and teachers of the sisters—organized various initiatives to raise funds for the family. Additional funds would be  raised via the local press and council, with the donations raised via all various methods ranging from 50 cents to $500. Consequently, all funds raised would enable the Grimes family to both pay the remaining mortgage on their home and bury Barbara and Patricia's bodies.&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} pp. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] held in the girls' memory on January 25,&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Mass (liturgy)|Holy Mass]] conducted at St. Maurice Church, Barbara and Patricia Grimes were laid to rest at the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in [[Worth, Illinois]], on January 28. All fees for the service were waived by the Wollschlager Funeral Home,&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt; and the sisters are buried side by side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unsolved Chicago Grimes Sisters' Murder is 59 Years Old|url=http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-history-cop/2015/12/unsolved-chicago-grimes-sisters-murder-is-59-years-old/ |website=chicagonow.com|accessdate=March 2, 2018|date=December 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those to serve [[pallbearer]]s at this service were classmates of Barbara's.&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1957, Lorretta Grimes received an anonymous telephone call from an individual who claimed to have undressed and killed her daughters. Although the Grimes family had received numerous hoax phone calls following the girls' disappearance,&lt;ref name="thetalkto.com"/&gt; this particular caller, having ridiculed police efforts to affix blame upon suspects such as Edward Bedwell, ended his phone call with information indicating he may indeed have been the perpetrator: "I know something about your little girl that no one else knows, not even the police. The smallest girl's toes were crossed at the feet!" This caller then laughed before terminating the call.&lt;ref name="ReferenceQ"&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

One year after the murder of her daughters, Lorretta Grimes publicly stated her conviction her daughters had been murdered by an individual they had known, stating that although the weather had been bitterly cold on the night of their abduction, Barbara and Patricia would never have entered a vehicle driven by an individual unknown to them, regardless of any discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Haunts: Ghostlore of the Windy City'' {{ISBN|0-96424-269-9}} p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Lohman, the Cook County Sheriff who strongly believed the Grimes sisters had been beaten, tortured and murdered by a sexual predator who had lured them into a vehicle on the evening of their disappearance, died of natural causes in 1969. At the time of his death, Lohman was the [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the School of Criminology in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 18th anniversary of the disappearance of the Grimes sisters, Ernest Spiotto, the sole detective who had been involved in the investigation of the girls' murders from the very beginning and who remained assigned to the investigation, again announced to the media the police had no credible [[suspect]]s in the case.&lt;ref name="ReferenceH"&gt;''Crimes of the Centuries: Notorious Crimes, Criminals, and Criminal Trials in American History'' {{ISBN|978-1-610-69594-7}} p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, the murders of the Grimes sisters remain unsolved, although this is an open case.

The Grimes sisters' younger brother, James Grimes, who was just 11 at the time of his sisters' murder, stated in 2013 that he welcomed what he saw as a public "reopening of the case," stating: "I just assumed it was never going to be solved. [But] maybe there's hope."&lt;ref name=naomi&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-05-30/news/ct-talk-grimes-cold-case-20130530_1_2-sisters-west-chicago-police-officer "Murders of 2 sisters in 1956 getting new look"] by Naomi Nix, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', May 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unofficial investigation ===
In 2013, a retired [[West Chicago]] police officer named Raymond Johnson began a personal investigation into the case.

Melquist had been convicted of the September 1958 murder of a 15-year-old girl named Bonnie Leigh Scott, whom he had known prior to her murder,&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; and whose [[decapitation|decapitated]] body had been found two months after her disappearance less than 10 miles from where the Grimes sisters' bodies had been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Lost Girls: The Mystery of the Grimes Sisters'' {{ISBN|978-1-892-52398-3}} p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Following the discovery of Scott's body, investigators had noted similarities in this murder and body disposal, and that of the Grimes sisters. Nonetheless, Melquist was never questioned as to his potential [[culpability]] in the Grimes sisters' murders, as his attorney had forbade him to be subject to questioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-history-cop/2017/09/59th-anniversary-of-the-murder-of-bonnie-leigh-scott-of-addison-could-lead-to-closure-in-the-1956-grimes-sisters-murder/|title=59th Anniversary of the Murder of Bonnie Leigh Scott of Addison Could Lead to Closure in the 1956 Grimes Sisters' Murder |first=Raymond|last=Johnson|date=September 21, 1997|publisher=|via=chicagonow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after the body of Bonnie Leigh Scott was discovered, Lorretta Grimes received a phone call from an individual who, on this occasion, claimed responsibility for Scott's murder. On this occasion, the caller had stated: "I've committed another perfect crime ... This is another one those cops won't solve and they're not going [to affix blame onto] Bedwell or Barry Cook."&lt;ref name="ReferenceQ"/&gt;{{refn|group=n|Cook was a criminal incarcerated at the [[Joliet Correctional Center]] who had admitted then denied his involvement in two murders dating from 1957.}} Lorretta Grimes would remain adamant until her death this caller had been the same individual who had contacted her in May 1957 and had revealed the [[deformity]] upon one of her daughters' feet which had never been released to the press or the public, stating: "I will never forget that voice."&lt;ref name="ReferenceQ"/&gt;

Charles Melquist was never charged with his alleged involvement in the deaths of the Grimes sisters. He died in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2 Investigators: The Unsolved 1956 Murder Of The Grimes Sisters |date=December 24, 2016 |url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2018/01/22/grimes-sisters-murder/ |publisher=CBS Chicago |accessdate=March 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Great Britain]], the term '''North–South divide''' refers to the economic and cultural differences between [[Southern England]] and the rest of Great Britain ([[Northern England]], [[The Midlands]], [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]]). The divide cuts through the [[English Midlands]].  Sometimes, the term is widened to include the whole [[United Kingdom]], with [[Northern Ireland]] included as part of "the North".

In political terms, the South, and particularly the [[South East England]] (outside [[inner London]]) and [[East of England]], is largely centre-right, and supportive of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], while the Greater North (particularly the towns and cities) is generally more supportive of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] as well as, in Scotland, the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]]. Support for the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], and for many of the smaller parties, is generally more equally spread out. There is some criticism of this analysis in the [[West Country]] which, until the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|May 2015 UK general election]], had consistently provided a solid base for the Liberal Democrats, and also in places (particularly parts of [[Bristol]], [[Devon]], and [[Cornwall]]) which suffer from many of the same economic problems as the North.

==Existence==
The North-South divide is not an exact line, but one that can involve many stereotypes, presumptions and other impressions of the surrounding region relative to other regions.

The existence of the North-South divide is fiercely contested. Some sources claim it exists but also that it is even expanding. For example, a report in 2001 found that North East England, [[North West England]] and Scotland had poorer health levels than South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Doran, Tim |author2=Drever, Frances |author3=Whitehead, Margaret | date = 1 May 2004 | url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/abstract/328/7447/1043?ijkey=76a2ead76e6828d38e96cd46ded8f235930215ca&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha |format = | title=Is there a north-south divide in social class inequalities in health in Great Britain? Cross sectional study using data from the 2001 census | publisher = | accessdate = 2006-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same data have been interpreted otherwise to indicate only a very small difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = J Martin | last = Bland | authorlink = Martin Bland | url = http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/329/7456/52 | title = North-south divide in social inequalities in Great Britain | publisher = British Medical Journal | date = 3 July 2004 | accessdate = 2006-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, results are highly dependent on the categories chosen for evaluation. As a generalisation, the following tend to indicate that there is some sort of north-south divide:

*Health conditions, which are generally seen as being worse in the north,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = John | last = Carvel | url = https://www.theguardian.com/northsouth/article/0,,1640082,00.html | title = Wide life expectancy gap between rich and poor | publisher = The Guardian | date = 11 November 2005 | accessdate = 2006-07-16 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = James | last = Meikle | url = https://www.theguardian.com/britain/article/0,,1522036,00.html | title = Cancer atlas reveals north-south divide | publisher = The Guardian | date = 6 July 2005 | accessdate = 2006-07-16 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; though spending on health care is higher &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reform.co.uk/Research/ResearchArticles/tabid/82/smid/378/ArticleID/1217/reftab/161/Default.aspx|title=Public sector finances: views from the inside|last=|first=|date=|work=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622033100/http://www.reform.co.uk/Research/ResearchArticles/tabid/82/smid/378/ArticleID/1217/reftab/161/Default.aspx|archive-date=22 June 2011|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*House prices, which are higher in the south, particularly the South-East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

*Earnings, which are higher in the south and east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = John | last = Carvel | url = https://www.theguardian.com/northsouth/article/0,,1638884,00.html | title = North-south, east-west wealth divides in survey | publisher = The Guardian | date = 10 November 2005 | accessdate = 2006-07-16 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Government spending per person on drivers of growth such as transport, infrastructure and R&amp;D, which is far higher in the South-East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.ippr.org/press-releases/111/8456/transport-spend-per-head-is-p2700-for-london-but-p5-per-head-in-north-east | title = Transport spend per head is £2,700 for London but £5 per head in North East | publisher = IPPR North | date = 19 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.ippr.org/publication/55/9949/northern-prosperity-is-national-prosperity-a-strategy-for-revitalising-the-uk-economy | title = Northern prosperity is national prosperity: A strategy for revitalising the UK economy | publisher = IPPR North, NEFC | date = 29 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Government expenditure per person, which is higher (both in gross terms and relative to tax revenues), in the North than the South; largely to fund universal benefits as a result of higher unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-487058/The-REAL-north-south-divide-How-South-East-bankrolling-Britain.html | title = The REAL north-south divide How South East bankrolling Britain | publisher = The Daily Mail | date = 12 October 2007 | location=London | first=Steve | last=Doughty}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Political influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Larry | last = Elliott | url = https://www.theguardian.com/northsouth/article/0,,1638884,00.html | title = The United Kingdom of London | publisher = The Guardian | date = 5 July 2004 | accessdate = 2006-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Devolution of powers to local government. London has a directly elected mayor with control over public transport whilst most Northern cities do not have mayors and have transport policies decided by the UK government.

However, many [[middle-class]] and affluent areas are located near most major cities north of the divide, and conversely there are pockets of large deprivation in the south. A report into wealth by [[Barclays Bank]] also highlighted the anomaly that the wealthiest parliamentary constituency outside London is actually [[Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Hallam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3871857.stm | work=BBC News | title=Wealth hotspots 'outside London' | date=7 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 survey by [[Halifax Building Society|Halifax]] stated that whilst nine of the top ten most expensive places to live in Britain were in the south of England, [[Edinburgh]] was ninth on the list, ahead of [[Salisbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/uk/the-10-most-expensive-and-least-expensive-cities-in-britain/bagpipers-stroll-down-the-road-in-edinburgh/ | work=Daily Telegraph | title=The 10 most expensive and least expensive cities in Britain | date=14 October 2012 | accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has led some commentators to suggest that other divisions, such as class&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Kamal | last = Ahmed | url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/education/story/0,12554,837171,00.html | title = Britain's class divide starts even before nursery school | publisher = The Observer | date = 10 November 2002 | accessdate = 2006-07-16 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ethnicity might be more important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dwp.gov.uk/publications/dwp/2006/poverty/tackling-poverty.pdf | title = Making a difference: Tackling poverty - a progress report | accessdate = 2006-07-16 | date = March 2006 | format = PDF | publisher = Department for Work and Pensions | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060725160232/http://www.dwp.gov.uk/publications/dwp/2006/poverty/tackling-poverty.pdf | archivedate = 25 July 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also controversy as to what constitutes the South given that it extends much farther longitudinally than the North of the country; some commentators have placed the [[West Country]] (in this case, Bristol,&lt;ref name="Bristol: State of the City" group=""&gt;{{cite news|last=Clark|first=Dave|title=Mr|url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/ccm/cms-service/stream/asset/?asset_id=36498092|accessdate=15 July 2011|date=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somerset, Devon and Cornwall) into a region of its own because the poverty in some of these areas is often as widespread as it is in the North, and political support is also focused on the usually widespread Liberal Democrats, until the 2015 general election when the Conservatives took virtually all the seats west of Bristol.

==Politics==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}
The North has been generally perceived as being supportive of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] as well as in Scotland the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] and the South being generally supportive of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]. During the 1980s, Labour councils in the North were often openly dismissive of any orders from the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] government.  Examples include [[Liverpool]] under the [[Militant tendency]] and [[Sheffield]] under [[David Blunkett]]. Furthermore, after the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General election]], the Conservatives held only one seat in Scotland and none in the major cities of [[Manchester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and [[Sheffield]] all of which were dominated by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]. The Conservatives hold two seats in [[Leeds]]. It can also be noted that major city councils in southern England tend to swing politically between Labour and Conservative control, despite being located in a wider region dominated singularly by the Conservatives. Examples of this include the cities of [[Southampton]] and [[Plymouth]].

'''Ohno's law''' was proposed by a Japanese-American biologist [[Susumu Ohno]], saying that the [[gene]] content of the [[mammal]]ian [[species]] has been conserved over species not only in the [[DNA]] content but also in the genes themselves. That is, nearly all mammalian species have conserved the [[X chromosome]] from their primordial X chromosome of a common ancestor.&lt;ref name=Ohno67&gt;Ohno S (1967). ''Sex Chromosomes and sex-linked genes.'' Berlin:Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence ==
As a [[Cell biology|cytological]] evidence, in first, mammalian X chromosomes in various species, including [[human]] and [[mouse]], have nearly the same size, with the content of about 5% of the genome. Second, for individual [[Locus (genetics)|gene loci]], a number of X-linked genes are common through mammalian species.  Examples are found in [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] (G6PD), a gene for polypeptide of [[antihemophilic globulin]] (AHG or [[Factor VIII]]) in [[Haemophilia A|hemophilia A]] and [[Haemophilia B|B]], and plasma thromboplastin component gene (PTC or [[Factor IX]]). Moreover, no instances were found where an [[Sex linkage|X-linked]] gene in one species was located on an [[autosome]] in the other species.&lt;ref name=Ohno67 /&gt;

== Conservation mechanisms ==
The content of a chromosome would be changed mainly by mutation after duplication of the chromosome and translocation with other chromosomes. However, in mammals, since the chromosomal [[Sex-determination system|sex-determination]] mechanism would have been established in their earlier stages of [[evolution]], [[polyploidy]] would have not occurred due to its incompatibility with the sex-determining mechanism. Moreover, X-autosome [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]] would have been prohibited because it might have resulted in detrimental effects for survival to the organism. Thus in mammals, the content of X chromosomes has been conserved after typical 2 round duplication events at early ancestral stages of evolution, at the fish or amphibia ([[2R hypothesis]]).&lt;ref name=Ohno67 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ohno70&gt;Ohno S (1970). ''Evolution by Gene Duplication.'' London: Allen and Unwin, {{ISBN|0-04-575015-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contradicting and supportive evidence ==
Genes on the long arm of the human X are contained in the monotreme X and genes on the short arm of the human X are distributed on the autosomes of marsupials.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;Watson JM, Riggs A, Graves JA (1992). "Gene mapping studies confirm the homology between the platypus X and echidna X1 chromosomes and identify a conserved ancestral monotreme X chromosome". ''Chromosoma'' 101(10): 596–601, {{PMID|1424984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ohno commented to the result that [[monotreme]]s and [[marsupial]]s were not considered to be ancestors of true mammals, but they have diverged very early from the main line of mammals.&lt;ref name=Ohno93&gt;Ohno S (1993). "Patterns in genome evolution". ''Curr Opin Genet Dev'' 3(6): 911–914, {{PMID|8118217}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chloride channel]] gene (''CLCN4'') was mapped to the human X but on chromosome 7 of C57BL/6 mice, species of [[House Mouse|''Mus musculus'']], though the gene is located on X of [[Algerian Mouse|''Mus spretus'']] and [[rat]].&lt;ref name=Palmer&gt;Palmer S, Perry J, Ashworth A (1995).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28072">'''Panopticism''' is a [[social theory]] named after the [[Panopticon]], originally developed by French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] in his book ''[[Discipline and Punish]].'' The "panopticon" refers to an experimental laboratory of power in which behaviour could be modified, and Foucault viewed the panopticon as a symbol of the disciplinary society of surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foucault|first1=Michel|title=Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison|date=1985|publisher=Penguin|location=Harmondsworth|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

[[Jeremy Bentham]] proposed the [[panopticon]] as a circular building with an observation tower in the centre of an open space surrounded by an outer wall.  This wall would contain cells for occupants.  This design would increase security by facilitating more effective [[surveillance]].  Residing within cells flooded with light, occupants would be readily distinguishable and visible to an official invisibly positioned in the central tower.  Conversely, occupants would be invisible to each other, with concrete walls dividing their cells. Due to the bright lighting emitted from the watch tower, occupants would not be able to tell if and when they are being watched, making discipline a passive rather than an active action. Strangely, the cell-mates act in matters as if they are being watched, though they cannot be certain eyes are actually on them. There is a type of invisible discipline that reigns through the prison, for each prisoner self-regulates, in fear that someone is watching their every move. Although usually associated with [[prison]]s, the panoptic style of architecture might be used in other institutions with surveillance needs, such as schools, factories, or hospitals.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

== Foucault's ''Discipline and Punish'' ==

In ''Discipline and Punish'', Michel Foucault builds on Bentham's conceptualization of the panopticon as he elaborates upon the function of disciplinary mechanisms in such a prison and illustrates the function of discipline as an apparatus of power.  The ever-visible inmate, Foucault suggests, is always "the object of information, never a subject in communication".&lt;ref name = cartome&gt;{{cite web |title = Part Three: Discipline 3. Panopticism |publisher= Cartome |url= http://www.cartome.org/foucault.htm |accessdate= 2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He adds that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"He who is subjected to a field of visibility, and who knows it, assumes responsibility for the constraints of power; he makes them play spontaneously upon himself; he inscribes in himself the power relation in which he simultaneously plays both roles; he becomes the principle of his own subjection" (202-203).&lt;ref name="Foucault, Michel 1995"&gt;Foucault, Michel. Discipline and Punishment. Vintage Books, New York: 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Foucault offers still another explanation for the type of "anonymous power" held by the operator of the central tower, suggesting that, "We have seen that anyone may come and exercise in the central tower the functions of surveillance, and that this being the case, he can gain a clear idea of the way the surveillance is practiced".&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. Discipline and Punishment. Vintage Books, New York: 1995., p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;  By including the anonymous "public servant," as part of the built-in "architecture" of surveillance, the disciplinary mechanism of observation is decentered and its efficacy improved.

As hinted at by the architecture, this panoptic design can be used for any "population" that needs to be kept under observation or control, such as: prisoners, schoolchildren, medical patients, or workers: &lt;blockquote&gt;"If the inmates are convicts, there is no danger of a plot, an attempt at collective escape, the planning of new crimes for the future, bad reciprocal influences; if they are patients, there is no danger of contagion; if they are madmen there is no risk of their committing violence upon one another; if they are schoolchildren, there is no copying, no noise, no chatter, no waste of time; if they are workers, there are no disorders, no theft, no coalitions, none of those distractions that slow down the rate of work, make it less perfect or cause accidents".&lt;ref name = cartome/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; By individualizing the subjects and placing them in a state of constant visibility, the efficiency of the institution is maximized. Furthermore, it guarantees the function of power, even when there is no one actually asserting it. It is in this respect that the Panopticon functions automatically. Foucault goes on to explain that this design is also applicable for a laboratory. Its mechanisms of individualization and observation give it the capacity to run many experiments simultaneously. These qualities also give an authoritative figure the "ability to penetrate men’s behavior" without difficulty.&lt;ref name = cartome/&gt; This is all made possible through the ingenuity of the geometric architecture.  In light of this fact Foucault compares jails, schools, and factories in their structural similarities.

== Examples in the late 20th and early 21st centuries ==

A central idea of Foucault’s panopticism concerns the systematic ordering and controlling of human populations through subtle and often unseen forces.  Such ordering is apparent in many parts of the modernized and now, increasingly digitalized, world of information.  Contemporary advancements in technology and surveillance techniques have perhaps made Foucault’s theories more pertinent to any scrutiny of the relationship between the state and its population.

However, while on one hand, new technologies, such as CCTV or other surveillance cameras, have shown the continued utility of panoptic mechanisms in liberal democracies, it could also be argued that electronic surveillance technologies are unnecessary in the original "organic" or "geometric" disciplinary mechanisms as illustrated by Foucault.  Foucault argues, for instance, that [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s Panopticon provides us with a model in which a self-disciplined society has been able to develop. These apparatuses of behavior control are essential if we are to govern ourselves, without the constant surveillance and intervention by an "agency" in every aspect of our lives. The Canadian historian [[Robert Gellately]] has observed, for instance, that because of the widespread willingness of Germans to inform on each other to the [[Gestapo]] that Germany between 1933-45 was a prime example of Panopticism.&lt;ref&gt;Gellately, Robert ''The Gestapo and German Society'', Clarendon Press: Oxford, 1990 pages 11-12 &amp; 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Panoptic theory has other wide-ranging impacts for surveillance in the digital era as well.  Kevin Haggerty and Richard Ericson, for instance, have hinted that technological surveillance "solutions" have a particularly "strong cultural allure" in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Richard V. Ericson and Kevin D. Haggerty, "The new politics of surveillance and visibility," University of Toronto Press, 2006., p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  Increasingly visible data, made accessible to organizations and individuals from new [[Data mining|data-mining]] technologies, has led to the proliferation of “[[dataveillance]],” which may be described as a mode of surveillance that aims to single out particular transactions through routine [[algorithm]]ic production.  In some cases, however, particularly in the case of mined credit card information, dataveillance has been documented to have led to a greater incidence of errors than past surveillance techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Richard V. Ericson and Kevin D. Haggerty, "The new politics of surveillance and visibility," University of Toronto Press, 2006., p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the tenets of Foucault's panopticism, if discursive mechanisms can be effectively employed to control and/or modify the body of discussion within a particular space (usually to the benefit of a particular governing class or organization), then there is no longer any need for an "active agent" to display a more overtly coercive power (i.e., the threat of violence).  Since the beginning of the [[Information Age]], there exists a debate over whether these mechanisms are being refined or accelerated, or on the other hand, becoming increasingly redundant, due to new and rapid technological advancements.

== Panopticism and capitalism ==

Foucault also relates panopticism to capitalism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[The] peculiarity of the disciplines [elements of Panopticism] is that they try to define in relation to the multiplicities a tactics of power that fulfils three criteria: firstly, to obtain the exercise of power at the lowest possible cost (economically, by the low expenditure it involves; politically, by its discretion, its low exteriorization, its relative invisibility, the little resistance it arouses); secondly, to bring the effects of this social power to their maximum intensity and to extend them as far as possible, without either failure or interval; thirdly, to link this 'economic' growth of power with the output of the apparatuses (educational, military, industrial or medical) within which it is exercised; in short, to increase both the docility and the utility of all elements of the system" (218).&lt;ref name="Foucault, Michel 1995"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If the economic take-off of the West began with the techniques that made possible the accumulation of capital, it might perhaps be said that the methods for administering the accumulation of men made possible a political take-off in relation to the traditional, ritual, costly, violent forms of power [i.e. torture, public executions, corporal punishment, etc. of the middle ages], which soon fell into disuse and were superseded by a subtle, calculated technology of subjection. In fact, the two processes - the accumulation of men and the accumulation of capital - cannot be separated; it would not be possible to solve the problem of the accumulation of men without the growth of an apparatus of production capable of both sustaining them and using them; conversely, the techniques that made the cumulative multiplicity of men useful accelerated the accumulation of capital ... The growth of the capitalist economy gave rise to the specific modality of disciplinary power, whose general formulas, techniques of submitting forces and bodies, in short, 'political anatomy', could be operated in the most diverse political régimes, apparatuses or institutions" (220-221).&lt;ref name="Foucault, Michel 1995"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Panopticism and information technology ==

Building onto Foucault's Panopticism and Bentham's original Panopticon, [[Shoshana Zuboff]] applies the Panoptical theory in a technological context in her book, "In the Age of the Smart Machine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|pages=315–361|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter nine, Zuboff provides a very vivid portrayal of the Information Panopticon as a means of surveillance, discipline and, in some cases, punishment in a work environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=326|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Information Panopticon embodies Bentham's idea in a very different way. Information Panopticons do not rely on physical arrangements, such as building structures and direct human supervision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=322|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, a computer keeps track of a worker’s every move by assigning him or her specific tasks to perform during their shift. Everything, from the time a task is started to the time it is completed, is recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=331|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workers are given a certain amount of time to complete the task based on its complexity. All this is monitored by supervision from a computer. Based on the data, the supervisor can monitor a worker’s performance and take any necessary action when needed.

The Information Panopticon can be defined as a form of centralized power that uses information and communication technology as observational tools and control mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kolar|first=Jeff|title=Business as Usual: The Information Panopticon and the Workplace|url=http://www.hastac.org/blogs/jeffkolar/business-usual-information-panopticon-and-workplace|work=Humanities, Arts, Science and Technology Alliance and Collaboratory|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Panopticon envisioned by Bentham and Foucault, in which those under surveillance were unwilling subjects, Zuboff’s work suggests that the Information Panopticon is facilitated by the benefits it offers to willing participants.

In chapter ten of “In the Age of the Smart Machine,” Zuboff provides the example of DIALOG, a computer conferencing system used at a pharmaceutical corporation in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Zuboff 1988 364"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=364|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conferencing system, originally intended to facilitate communication among the corporation’s many branches, quickly became popular with employees. Users of DIALOG found that the system facilitated not only innovation and collaboration, but also relaxation, as many employees began to use the system to joke with one another and discuss non-work related topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=377|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employees widely reported that using the system was a positive experience because it created a culture of shared information and discussion, which transcended the corporation’s norms of formality and hierarchy that limited the spread of information between divisions and employees of different ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=368|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This positive culture was enabled by the privacy seemingly offered by the conferencing system, as discussion boards could be made to allow access only to those who were invited to participate.&lt;ref name="Zuboff 1988 364"/&gt; The Panoptic function of the conferencing system was revealed, however, when managers were able to gain access to the informal discussion boards where employees posted off-color jokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=378|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Messages from the discussion were posted around the office to shame contributors, and many of DIALOG’s users, now knowing there was a possibility that their contributions could be read by managers and fearing they would face disciplinary action, stopped using the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=380|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some users, however, kept using the system, raising the question of whether remaining users modified their behavior under the threat of surveillance, as prisoners in Bentham’s Panopticon would, or whether they believed that the benefits offered by the system outweighed the possibility of punishment.

Zuboff’s work shows the dual nature of the Information Panopticon – participants may be under surveillance, but they may also use the system to conduct surveillance of others by monitoring or reporting other users’ contributions. This is true of many other information and communication technologies with Panoptic functions – cellphone owners may be tracked without their knowledge through the phones’ GPS capabilities, but they may also use the device to conduct surveillance of others. Thus, compared to Bentham’s Panopticon, the Information Panopticon is one in which everyone has the potential to be both a prisoner and a guard.

It is argued by Foucault that [[industrial management]] has paved the way for a very disciplinary society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=319|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A society that values objectivity over everything else. The point of this is to get as much productivity from the workers as possible. Contrasting with Bentham's model prison, workers within the Information Panopticon know they are being monitored at all times. Even if a supervisor is not physically there, the computer records their every move and all this data is at the supervisor's finger tips at all times. The system's objectivity can have a psychological impact on the workers. Workers feel the need to conform and satisfy the system rather than doing their best work or expressing concerns they might have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=342|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Information Panopticon diverts from [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s model prison by adding more levels of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|pages=337–341|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the Bentham's model prison system is made up of inmates at the lowest level monitored by a guard, the Information Panopticon can have various levels. A company or firm can have various satellite locations, each monitored by a supervisor, and then a regional supervisor monitoring the supervisors below him or her. Depending on the structure and size of a firm, information Panopticons can have several levels, each monitoring all the levels beneath it.

Now, the efficiency of the Information Panopticon is in question. Does it really lead to a better work place and higher productivity, or does it simply put unnecessary stress on the people being monitored? A major criticism of the system is its objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=360|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is solely based on numbers, therefore not allowing for human error. According to Zuboff, some people find the system to be highly advantageous, while others think it is very flawed because it does not account for the effort a worker puts into a task or things outside of a worker's control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|pages=351–353|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the lack of direct supervision only adds to a potentially precarious situation.

== Post-panopticism ==

Theoretical arguments in favor of rejecting the Foucauldian model of Panopticism may be considered under five general headings:&lt;ref name=Boyne&gt;Boyne, Roy (2000). Post-Panopticism, Economy and Society, 29:2, 285-307.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Displacement of the Panoptical ideal by mechanisms of seduction,
# Redundancy of the Panoptical impulse brought about by the evident durability of the self-surveillance functions which partly constitute the normal, socialized, ‘Western’ subject,
# Reduction in the number of occasions of any conceivable need for Panoptical surveillance on account of simulation, prediction and action before the fact,
# Supplementation of the Panopticon by the Synopticon,
# Failure of Panoptical control to produce reliably docile subjects.

The first point concerns [[Zygmunt Bauman]]’s argument that the leading principle of social order has moved from Panopticism to seduction.  This argument is elaborated in his 1998 essay ‘On postmodern uses of sex’.&lt;ref name= Bauman&gt;Bauman, Z. (1998) Globalization: The Human Consequences, Cambridge: Polity.—— 1999 ‘On postmodern uses of sex’, in Mike Featherstone (ed.) Love and Eroticism, London: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second argument concerns surveillance redundance, and it is increasingly relevant in the age of [[Facebook]] and online self-disclosure.  Is the metaphor of a panopticon appropriate for voluntary surrender of privacy?{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The third argument for post-Panopticism, concerning action before the fact, is articulated by William Bogard:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The figure of the Panopticon is already haunted by a parallel figure of simulation.  Surveillance, we are told, is discreet, unobtrusive, camouflaged, unverifiable – all elements of artifice designed into an architectural arrangement of spaces to produce real effects of discipline. Eventually this will lead, by its means of perfection, to the elimination of the Panopticon itself . . . surveillance as its own simulation. Now it is no longer a matter of the speed at which information is gained to defeat an enemy. . . . Now, one can simulate a space of control, project an indefinite number of courses of action, train for each possibility, and react immediately with pre-programmed responses to the actual course of events . . . with simulation, sight and foresight, actual and virtual begin to merge. . . . Increasingly the technological enlargement of the field of perceptual control, the erasure of distance in the speed of electronic information has pushed surveillance beyond the very limits of speed toward the purest forms of anticipation.&lt;ref name=Bogard&gt;Bogard, W. (1996). The Simulation of Surveillance, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This kind of anticipation is particularly evident in emergent surveillance technologies such as [[social network analysis]].

The ‘Synopticon’ concerns the surveillance of the few by the many.&lt;ref name=Mathiesen&gt;Mathiesen, T. (1997) ‘The viewer society’, Theoretical Criminology 1(2).&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of this kind of surveillance may include the theatre, the Coliseum, and celebrity tabloid reporting.  This “reversal of the Panoptical polarity may have become so marked that it finally deconstructs the Panoptical metaphor altogether”.&lt;ref name=Boyne /&gt;

Finally, the fifth point concerns the self-defeating nature of Panoptical regimes.  The failure of surveillance states is illustrated by examples such as “prison riots, asylum sub-cultures, ego survival in Gulag or concentration camp, [and] retribalization in the Balkans.”&lt;ref name=Boyne /&gt;

In their 2007 article, Dobson and Fisher&lt;ref name=Dobson_Fisher&gt;Dobson, J. E., and P. F. Fisher. 2007. The Panopticon's changing geography. Geographical Review 97 (3): 307-323.&lt;/ref&gt; lay out an alternative model of post-panopticism as they identify three panoptic models.  Panopticism I refers to [[Jeremy Bentham]]’s original conceptualization of the panopticon, and is it the model of panopticism that Foucault responds to in his 1975 [[Discipline and Punish]].  Panopticism II refers to an [[Orwellian]] ‘Big Brother’ ideal of surveillance.  Panopticism III, the final model of panopticism, refers to the high-technology human tracking systems that are emergent in this 21st century.  These [[geographical information systems]] (GIS) include technologies such as cellphone GPS, [[RFID]]s (radio-frequency identification tags), and [[geo-fence]]s.  Panopticism III is also distinguished by its costs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Panopticon III is affordable, effective, and available to anyone who wants to use it. Initial purchase prices and monthly service fees are equivalent to cell-phone costs. In less than five years, the cost of continuous surveillance of a single individual has dropped from several hundred thousand dollars per year to less than $500 per year. Surveillance formerly justified solely for national security and high-stakes commerce is readily available to track a spouse, child, parent, employee, neighbor, or stranger.&lt;ref name=Dobson_Fisher /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Cornell University]] professor and information theorist Branden Hookway introduced the concept of a Panspectrons in 2000: an evolution of the panopticon to the effect that it does not define an object of surveillance more, but everyone and everything is monitored. The object is defined only in relation to a specific issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://uncommonculture.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1363/1282 | title=Tactical memory: The politics of openness in the construction of memory| journal=First Monday| volume=11| issue=7| date=2006-07-03| last1=Braman| first1=Sandra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paris School (Security Studies)|Paris School]] academic [[Didier Bigo]] coined the term [[Banopticon|'Banopticon']] to describe a situation where profiling technologies are used to determine who to place under surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;Bigo, Didier (2006), "Security, Exception, Ban and Surveillance.", in Lyon, David, ''Theorizing Surveillance. The panopticon and beyond.'', Wilan Publishing, pp. 46–47, {{ISBN|978-1843921912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bill was sponsored by the Home Office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/about-us/legislation/protection-freedoms-bill/ Protection of Freedoms Bill] Home Office&lt;/ref&gt; On Tuesday, 1 May 2012 the Protection of Freedoms bill completed its passage through Parliament and received Royal Assent.

The programme was later changed to refer to a '''Freedom Bill'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archivedate=19 September 2010 |url=http://programmeforgovernment.hmg.gov.uk/civil-liberties/index.html|title=Civil Liberties|work=The Coalition: our Programme for Government|quote=We will introduce a Freedom Bill|accessdate=21 May 2015|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100919110641/http://programmeforgovernment.hmg.gov.uk/civil-liberties/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Protection of Freedoms Bill was introduced in 2011, critics claimed it was piecemeal, incoherent, and too focused on protection from public-sector intrusion without sufficient focus on private-sector intrusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newlawjournal.co.uk/nlj/content/rollback-state-surveillance|title=Rollback of state surveillance |last=Cran|first=Donald|date=25 March 2011|work=New Law Journal|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nick Clegg]] said, "There may even be a great repeal act down the road that would look at some of the laws not addressed in this bill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/feb/13/nick-clegg-protection-freedoms-bill|title=Why we should believe Nick Clegg when he promises to restore liberties stolen by Labour|last=Porter|first=Henry|date=13 February 2011|work=[[The Observer]]|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Jonathan Djanogly]] said in answer to a [[UK Parliamentary questions|parliamentary question]] that a Repeals Bill would be a separate civil liberties measure from "the [[Identity Documents Act 2010|abolition of ID cards]]; the Protection of Freedoms Bill; and the Your Freedom public engagement exercise which took place over the summer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110405/text/110405w0003.htm|title=Law: Repealed|date=5 Apr 2011|work=House of Commons Hansard|publisher=UK Parliament|pages=c.795W Q.51332|accessdate=21 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Part 1: Regulation of biometric data==

Chapter 1 makes provision in respect of the destruction, retention, and use of fingerprints, footwear impressions and DNA samples. In addition it covers profiles taken in the course of a criminal investigation. Under the new scheme provided for in this Chapter, the fingerprints and DNA profiles taken from persons arrested for or charged with a minor offence will be destroyed following either acquittal or a decision not to charge.

This Part amends or omits Sections from the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]] and [[Crime and Security Act 2010]] relating to the retention of fingerprints.

*Section 20 of Chapter 1 instructs the Secretary of State to appoint a Commissioner, to be known as the [[Commissioner for the Retention and Use of Biometric Material]], to review the use and retention of biometrics by the government
*Section 24 of Chapter 1 instructs the Secretary of State to make arrangements for a "National DNA Database Strategy Board" to oversee the operation of a DNA database.
* Chapter 2 requires schools and colleges to obtain consent of one parent of a child under 18 for acquiring and processing the child's biometric information and gives the child rights to stop the processing of their biometric information regardless of any parental consent. It also states that processing of biometric information it must be discontinued if any parent of the child objects.

==Part 2: Regulation of surveillance==
{{See also|Automatic number plate recognition in the United Kingdom}}

Chapter 1 creates new regulation for, and instructs the Secretary of State to prepare a code of practice towards [[closed-circuit television]] and [[automatic number plate recognition]]. Chapter 2 amends the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]].

==Part 3: Protection of property from disproportionate enforcement action==

Chapter 1 reforms and repeals aspects of the powers to enter land and to review existing powers of entry legislation. It would implement restrictions as to the premises over which the power may be exercised, who can exercise them, and which conditions can be satisfied for them to be exercised.

Chapter 2 makes it a criminal offence for a private person on private or public land to immobilise a vehicle (e.g. by [[wheel clamp|clamping]] or obstructing), or to move a vehicle, with a view to denying the owner access to it. Section 99 of the [[Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984]] is amended to extend and amend the powers of public authorities to move vehicles parked obstructively, illegally, or dangerously, including on private land. However, clamping is still permitted where an Act of Parliament or byelaw permits the practice, such as the Railway Byelaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/railway-byelaws/railway-byelaws.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816202559/http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/railway-byelaws/railway-byelaws.pdf |archivedate=16 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clamping of vehicles and provisions relating to charging registered keepers of vehicles where a contract has been entered into with landowners or their agents is dealt with by Clauses 54-56 and Schedule 4 of the Act. These would have the effect of making it possible for private landowners and their agents to attempt to recover unpaid parking charges on private land (providing certain conditions are met) from the registered keeper of a vehicle in cases where it is not known who was driving at the time of the parking charge notice being issued. Paragraph 3 defines "relevant land" as excluding highways maintainable at the public expense (within the meaning of section 329(1) of the Highways Act 1980). Under the original wording of the Bill as introduced, clamping would be unlawful on private car-parks unless entrances are barriered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://obiterj.blogspot.com/2011/02/vehicle-immobilisation-clamping.html Vehicle immobilisation (clamping) ... The Protection of Freedoms Bill No. 4] Law and Lawyers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ofinteresttolwayers.blogspot.com/2011/02/goodbye-clamping.html Goodbye Clamping] Of Interest to Lawyers&lt;/ref&gt; However, Clause 54 was amended at Report stage in the House of Commons such that clamping would be unlawful regardless of the existence of a barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111010/debtext/111010-0004.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 10 Oct 2011  (pt 0004)|first=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons,|last=Westminster|website=www.publications.parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Part 4: Counter-terrorism powers==

Clause 57 reduces the pre-detention of terrorist suspects to a maximum of 14 days.

This Part removes the 'stop and search' regulations of the [[Terrorism Act 2000]] and reforms the operation of the power to search people and vehicles, in addition to creating new Code of Practice rules in respect of these powers.

==Part 5: Safeguarding vulnerable groups, criminal records etc.==
{{outdated section|reason= Seems to have been written before Royal Assent, refers to the Bill rather than the Act.|date=September 2015}}
*Chapters 1 and 2 amend the [[Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006]] and [[Police Act 1997]] with regards to carers and criminal record checks. The Bill also proposes removing the Controlled Activity and Monitoring sections from the Safeguarding of Vulnerable Groups Act.
* Chapter 3 creates a new [[body corporate]] to be known as the [[Disclosure and Barring Service]], which merges the functions of the [[Independent Safeguarding Authority]] and [[Criminal Records Bureau]].
* Chapter 4 allows people to apply for the Secretary of State to disregard criminal convictions for homosexual acts by consenting adults under section 12 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956]], or the "gross indecency between men" section of that Act. Clause 96 confirms that the effect of a successful application would ensure the person is considered as having not committed, nor been charged, prosecuted or convicted of a homosexual act.

==Part 6: Freedom of information and data protection==

* This part extends the existing [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]], extending the scope of the Act and amending the role of the [[Information Commissioner]]. This includes widening the rules on applying for and receiving datasets from public authorities for re-use.

==Part 7: Miscellaneous and general==

* Section 113 repealed section 43 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] which makes provision for trials on indictment to be conducted without a jury in certain fraud cases. Sections 44-50 of that Act, which make provision for trials on indictment to be conducted without a jury where there is a danger of jury tampering, were not affected.
* Section 114 repealed the restrictions that prohibit solemnizing marriages and civil partnerships during evenings and at night. Since the [[Marriage Act 1836]] it had been forbidden to marry between the hours of six in the evening and eight in the morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12439232 |title=Night-time weddings to be allowed |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]] |date=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Psychological pain''', '''mental pain''', or '''emotional pain''' is an unpleasant feeling (a [[suffering]]) of a psychological, non-physical origin.

==Cause==
The adjective 'psychological' is thought to encompass  the functions of beliefs, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors,&lt;ref name="Covington_2000"&gt;{{vcite journal | author = Covington EC| title = Psychogenic pain--What it means, why it does not exist, and how to diagnose it| journal = Pain Medicine| volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 287-94 | year = 2000 | pmid = | pmc = | doi = 10.1046/j.1526-4637.2000.00049.x | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1526-4637.2000.00049.x/abstract | issn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which may be seen as an indication for the many sources of psychological pain. One way of grouping these different sources of pain was offered by Shneidman, who stated that psychological pain is caused by frustrated psychological needs.&lt;ref name="Shneidman_1996" /&gt;  For example, the need for love, autonomy, affiliation, and achievement, or the need to avoid harm, shame, and embarrassment. [[Psychological needs]] were originally described by [[Henry Murray]] in 1938 as needs that motivate human behavior.&lt;ref name="Murray_2008"&gt;{{ cite book  | author= Murray HA | title= Explorations in personality | edition = 70 | year= 2008 | publisher= Oxford University Press | location= New York, NY | isbn= 978-0-19-530506-7 | chapter= | chapterurl = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shneidman maintained that people rate the importance of each need differently, which explains why people's level of psychological pain differs when confronted with the same frustrated need. This needs perspective coincides with [[Patrick David Wall]]'s description of physical pain that says that physical pain indicates a need state much more than a sensory experience.&lt;ref name="wall_1979"&gt;{{vcite journal | author = Wall PD. | title = On the relation of injury to pain| journal = Pain| volume = 6 | issue =  | pages = 253-64 | year = 1979 | pmid = | pmc = | doi = 10.1016/0304-3959(79)90047-2 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304395979900472| issn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fields of [[social psychology]] and [[personality psychology]], the term social pain is used to denote psychological pain caused by harm or threat to social connection; bereavement, embarrassment, shame and hurt feelings are subtypes of social pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= MacDonald |first1= Geoff |editor1-first= Philip J. |editor1-last= Corr |editor2-first= Gerald |editor2-last= Matthews |title= Cambridge Handbook of Personality Psychology |year= 2009 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge UK |isbn= 9780521680516 |chapter= Social Pain and Hurt Feelings  |chapterurl=http://web.psych.utoronto.ca/gmacdonald/macdonald_social_pain_chapter.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From an evolutionary perspective, psychological pain forces the assessment of actual or potential social problems that might reduce the individual's fitness for survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Thornhill R, Wilmsen Thornhill N. |editor1-first= RW |editor1-last= Bell |editor2-first= NJ |editor2-last= Bell |title= Sociobiology and the Social Sciences |year= 1989 |publisher= Texas Tech University Press |location= Lubbock, Texas |isbn= 0-89672-161-2 |chapter= The Evolution of Psychological Pain  |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The way we display our psychological pain socially (for example, crying, shouting, moaning) serves the purpose of indicating that we are in need.

==Emotional agony in borderline personality disorder==
{{Main|Borderline personality disorder}}
Borderline personality disorder (BPD) has long been believed to be the one psychiatric disorder that produced the most intense emotional pain, agony, and distress in those who suffer with this condition. Studies have shown that borderline patients experience chronic and significant emotional [[suffering]] and mental agony.&lt;ref name=PM&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fertuck|first1=EA.|last2=Jekal|first2=A.|last3=Song|first3=I.|last4=Wyman|first4=B.|last5=Morris|first5=MC.|last6=Wilson|first6=ST.|last7=Brodsky|first7=BS.|last8=Stanley|first8=B.|title=Enhanced 'Reading the Mind in the Eyes' in borderline personality disorder compared to healthy controls|journal=Psychological Medicine|date=December 2009|volume=39|issue=12|pages=1979–1988|doi=10.1017/S003329170900600X|pmc=3427787|pmid=19460187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DSM-IV&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)|date=1994|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-89-042061-4|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borderline patients may feel overwhelmed by negative emotions, experiencing intense [[grief]] instead of sadness, shame and humiliation instead of mild embarrassment, rage instead of annoyance and panic instead of nervousness.&lt;ref name = Linehan_44&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with BPD are especially sensitive to feelings of rejection, isolation and perceived failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stiglmayr CE, Grathwol T, Linehan MM, Ihorst G, Fahrenberg J, Bohus M |title=Aversive tension in patients with borderline personality disorder: a computer-based controlled field study |journal= [[Acta Psychiatr Scand]] |volume=111 |issue=5 |pages=372–9 |date=May 2005 |pmid=15819731 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2004.00466.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both clinicians and laymen alike have witnessed the desperate attempts to escape these subjective inner experiences of these patients. Borderline patients are severely impulsive and their attempts to alleviate the agony are often very destructive or self-destructive. Suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, eating disorders ([[anorexia nervosa]] and [[bulimia nervosa]]), self-harm (cutting, overdosing, etc.), compulsive spending, gambling, sex addiction, violent and aggressive behaviour, sexual promiscuity and deviant sexual behaviours, are desperate attempts to escape. The intrapsychic pain experienced by those diagnosed with BPD has been studied and compared to normal healthy controls and to others suffering from [[major depression]], bipolar disorder, [[substance use disorder]], schizophrenia, other [[personality disorder]]s, and a range of other conditions. The excruciatingly painful inner experience of the borderline patient is both unique and perplexing. In clinical populations, the rate of suicide of patients with borderline personality disorder is estimated to be 10%, a rate far greater than that in the general population and still considerably greater than for patients with [[schizophrenia]] and [[bipolar disorder]]. However, since 60–70% of patients with borderline personality disorder make suicide attempts; suicide attempts are far more frequent than completed suicides in patients with borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref name=Oldham&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oldham|first1=JM|title=Borderline Personality Disorder and Suicidality|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|date=2006|volume=163|issue=1|pages=20–26|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.1.20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intense [[dysphoria|dysphoric]] states which patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) endure on a regular basis distinguishes them from those suffering from other personality disorders, [[major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], and virtually all known Axis I and Axis II conditions. In a study, twenty-five dysphoric states (mostly affects) were found to be significantly more common among borderline patients than controls. Twenty-five other dysphoric states (mostly cognitions) were found to be both significantly more common among borderline patients than controls and highly specific to borderline personality disorder. These states tended to fall into one of four clusters: (1) extreme feelings, (2) destructiveness or self-destructiveness, (3) fragmentation or "identitylessness", and (4) victimization. In addition, three of the 25 more-specific states (feeling betrayed, like hurting myself, and completely out of control), when occurring together, were particularly strongly associated with the borderline diagnosis. Equally important, overall mean Dysphoric Affect Scale scores correctly distinguished borderline personality disorder from other personality disorders and mood disorders such as bipolar disorder, major depression, and anxiety disorders in 84% of the subjects. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that the subjective pain of borderline patients may be both more pervasive and more multifaceted than previously recognized, and that the overall “amplitude” (or intensity) of this pain may be a particularly good marker for the borderline diagnosis.&lt;ref name=BPDPain&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zanarini|first1=MC|last2=Gunderson|first2=JG|authorlink2=John G.

==Neural mechanisms==

Research suggests that physical pain and psychological pain may share some underlying neurological mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The neural bases of social pain: Evidence for shared representations with physical pain|pmid=22286852|doi=10.1097/PSY.0b013e3182464dd1|volume=74|pages=126–35|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|year=2012 | last1 = Eisenberger | first1 = NI|pmc=3273616}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mee_2006"&gt;{{vcite journal | author = Mee, S, Bunney, BG, Reist, C, Potkin, SG, &amp; Bunney, WE.| title = Psychological pain: a review of evidence| journal = Journal of Psychiatric Research| volume = 40 | issue = 8 | pages = 680-90 | year = 2006 | pmid = | pmc = | doi = 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2006.03.003 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395606000586| issn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eisenberger | first1 = Naomi I. | last2 = Lieberman | first2 = Matthew D. |date=Jul 2004 | title = Why rejection hurts: a common neural alarm system for physical and social pain | url = | journal = Trends Cogn Sci | volume = 8 | issue = 7| pages = 294–300 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2004.05.010 | pmid=15242688}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="meerwijk_2012"&gt;{{vcite journal | author = Meerwijk, EL, Ford, JM, &amp; Weiss, SJ.| title = Brain regions associated with psychological pain: implications for a neural network and its relationship to physical pain| journal = Brain Imaging Behav| volume =  | issue =  | pages =  | year = 2012 | pmid = | pmc = | doi = 10.1007/s11682-012-9179-y | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/l144550600565934/| issn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brain regions that were consistently found to be implicated in both types of pain are the anterior [[cingulate cortex]] and [[prefrontal cortex]] (some subregions more than others), and may extend to other regions as well. Brain regions that were also found to be involved in psychological pain include the [[insular cortex]], posterior cingulate cortex, [[thalamus]], [[parahippocampal gyrus]], [[basal ganglia]], and [[cerebellum]]. Some advocate that, because similar brain regions are involved in both physical pain and psychological pain, we should see pain as a continuum that ranges from purely physical to purely psychological.&lt;ref name="biro_2010"&gt;{{vcite journal | author = Biro D. | title = Is there such a thing as psychological pain? and why It matters| journal =Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry | volume = 34 | issue = 4 | pages = 658-67 | year = 2010 | pmid = | pmc = | doi = 10.1007/s11013-010-9190-y | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/n22t0n2427qh5612/| issn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, many sources mention the fact that we use metaphors of physical pain to refer to psychological pain experiences.&lt;ref name="macdonald_2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="meerwijk_2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="flaskerud_2011"&gt;{{vcite journal | author = Flaskerud JH.| title = Heartbreak and physical pain linked in brain| journal = Issues in Mental Health Nursing| volume = 32 | issue =  | pages = 789-91 | year = 2011 | pmid = | pmc = | doi = 10.3109/01612840.2011.583714 | url = | issn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further connection between physical and psychological pain has been supported through proof that [[acetaminophen]], an analgesic, can suppress activity in the anterior cingulate cortex and the insular cortex when experiencing social exclusion, the same way that it suppresses activity when experiencing physical pain.&lt;ref&gt;Dewall, C.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Research has shown that use of analgesic [[paracetamol]] for several weeks reduces neural response to meaning threats, such as thinking about death,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/04/11/0956797612464786.abstract|title=The Common Pain of Surrealism and Death|work=sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reduces the agitation of people with dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4065|title=Efficacy of treating pain to reduce behavioural disturbances in residents of nursing homes with dementia: cluster randomised clinical trial|work=bmj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=1713&amp;pageNumber=3|title=Reducing agitation through pain relief - Living with dementia magazine October 2011 - Alzheimer's Society|work=alzheimers.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; However use of paracetamol for more general psychological pain remains disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/news/2013/04April/Pages/paracetamol-not-recommended-for-painful-emotions.aspx|title=Don't take paracetamol for painful emotions|work=www.nhs.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many religious traditions, such as the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] in Buddhism, have attempted or managed to provide treatment of psychological suffering. [[Meditation]] has mental health benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/news/2010/08August/Pages/Meditation-and-brain-changes.aspx|title=Meditation changes the brain|work=www.nhs.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/tag/mindfulness-meditation/|title=Mindfulness Meditation|website=Harvard Gazette|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common form of meditative practice as therapy is mindfulness, but breath focused exercises are also used for dealing with the stresses and anxiety related to emotional pain, reducing physiological symptoms.

A '''puzzle''' is a [[game]], [[problem]], or [[toy]] that tests a person's [[ingenuity]] or [[knowledge]]. In a puzzle, the solver is expected to put pieces together in a logical way, in order to arrive at the correct or fun solution of the puzzle. There are different genres of puzzles, such as crossword puzzles, word-search puzzles, number puzzles, relational puzzles, or logic puzzles.

Puzzles are often created to be a form of entertainment but they can also arise from serious [[Mathematical problem|mathematical]] or [[logistics|logistical]] problems. In such cases, their solution may be a significant contribution to mathematical research.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall G.; Parkes A.; and Spoerer K. (2008) ''A Survey of NP-Complete Puzzles'', International Computer Games Association Journal, 31(1), pp 13–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The 1989 edition of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' dates the word ''puzzle'' (as a [[verb]]) to the end of the 16th century. Its first documented use (to describe a new type of game) was in a book titled ''The Voyage of [[Robert Dudley (explorer)|Robert Dudley]]...to the West Indies, 1594–95, narrated by Capt. Wyatt, by himself, and by Abram Kendall, master'' (published circa 1595). The word later came to be used as a [[noun]].

The word puzzle comes from ''pusle'', meaning "bewilder, confound", which is a [[frequentive]] of the obsolete verb ''pose'' (from Medieval French ''aposer'') in the sense of "perplex". The use of the word to mean "a toy contrived to test one's ingenuity" is relatively recent (within mid-19th century).

==Genres==

==Puzzle solving==
{{Original research section|date=November 2018}}
Solutions of puzzles often require the recognition of [[pattern]]s and the adherence to a particular kind of ordering. People with a high level of [[inductive reasoning aptitude]] may be better at solving such puzzles than others. But puzzles based upon [[inquiry]] and [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]] may be solved more easily by those with good [[Deductive reasoning|deduction skills]]. Deductive reasoning improves with practice. Mathematical puzzles often involves BODMAS. [[BODMAS]] is an acronym and it stands for Bracket, Of, Division, Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction. In certain regions, PEDMAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Division, Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction) is the synonym of BODMAS. It explains the order of operations to solve an expression. Some mathematical puzzle requires Top to Bottom convention to avoid the [[ambiguity]] in the order of operations. It is an elegantly simple idea that relies, as [[sudoku]] does, on the requirement that numbers appear only once starting from top to bottom as coming along.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==History of jigsaw puzzles==
{{Main article | Jigsaw puzzles}}
[[Jigsaw puzzles]] are perhaps the most popular form of puzzle. Jigsaw puzzles were invented around 1760, when [[John Spilsbury (cartographer)|John Spilsbury]], a British engraver and [[cartographer]], mounted a map on a sheet of wood, which he then sawed around the outline of each individual country on the map. He then used the resulting pieces as an aid for the teaching of geography.

After becoming popular among the public, this kind of teaching aid remained the primary use of jigsaw puzzles until about 1820.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jigsaw-puzzle.org/jigsaw-puzzle-history.html History of Jigsaw Puzzles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] The American Jigsaw Puzzle Society&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest puzzle (40,320 pieces) is made by German game company [[Ravensburger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ravensburger.us/discover/40-320-pieces-disney-puzzle/index.html|title=The worlds biggest Puzzle {{!}} Ravensburger|website=www.ravensburger.us|language=en|access-date=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smallest puzzle ever made was created at LaserZentrum Hannover. It is only five square millimetres, the size of a sand grain.

==History of other puzzles==

By the early 20th century, magazines and newspapers had found that they could increase their readership by publishing [[puzzle contest]]s, beginning with [[crosswords]] and in modern days [[sudoku]].

==Organizations and events==

There are organizations and events that cater to puzzle enthusiasts, such as:

* [[World Puzzle Championship]]
* [[National Puzzlers' League]]
* [[Puzzlehunt]]s such as the [[Maze of Games]]

'''Quantum topology''' is a branch of mathematics that connects [[quantum mechanics]] with [[low-dimensional topology]].

[[Dirac notation]] provides a viewpoint of quantum mechanics which becomes amplified into a framework that can embrace the amplitudes associated with [[topological space]]s and the related embedding of one space within another such as knots and links in three-dimensional space. This [[bra–ket notation]] of kets and bras can be generalised, becoming maps of [[vector space]]s associated with [[topological space]]s that allow [[tensor product]]s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Quantum  Topology and Quantum Computing by Louis H. Kauffman&lt;/ref&gt;

Topological [[Tangle (mathematics)|entanglement]] involving [[Link (knot theory)|linking]] and [[Braid theory|braiding]] can be intuitively related to [[quantum entanglement]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

A '''round''', in the [[esoteric cosmology]] of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], [[Anthroposophy]] and [[Rosicrucianism]], is a cosmic cycle or sequence by which an evolving reincarnating being passes through the various stages of existence as the [[Earth]], the [[Solar System]] or the [[Cosmos]] comes into and passes out of [[wikt:manifestation|manifestation]].

==Theosophy==
In Theosophy, the whole process is very simple. A round is a process in a [[planetary chain]], according to which a life cycle or [[life-wave]] of [[souls]] or [[Monad (Theosophy)|monads]] begins its evolutionary journey on the first and most subtle or spiritual of the series of seven globes; then finishing its evolution there, proceeds to the next, and so on, to the densest or most manifest globe (usually called globe D), which in our case is the gross, physical [[Earth]]. From there it proceeds on the [[ascending arc]], through increasingly more ethereal globes. Each of these globes are in coadunition with the physical earth, though they are not in consubstantiation with it. Each of these stages is called a ''round'', and during this time the reincarnating life wave has passed through seven [[Root Race]]s.

When the life wave has gone through all seven globes of the planetary chain, it has completed one ''planetary round'' or ''globe manvantara''. This is followed by the dissolution of the planetary chain in a nirvana (which is not the same as what [[Buddhism]] calls [[Nirvana (concept)|nirvana]] because it is not permanent); this period between physical manifestation is called [[pralaya]] in [[Hinduism]].  Finally, a new round begins, in which consciousness is now more developed than in the preceding round.

Seven such planetary rounds (or forty-nine globe rounds) represents one [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]] or ''manvantara'' or ''day of Brahma''. This is followed by a higher "nirvana" or pralaya, which is the pralaya of that planetary chain. This lasts until a new planetary chain forms with its various life waves.

Seven such planetary chains and their pralayas constitute a solar manvantara, after which the solar system is dissolved in a cosmic pralaya, before the cycle begins anew.

This elaborate cosmology, first formulated by [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky|Blavatsky]], was also taught by [[Gottfried de Purucker|de Purucker]], [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|Leadbeater]], and [[Alice Bailey]].

==Anthroposophy==
[[Rudolf Steiner]] retained the basic concept of root races and sevenfold cycles within cycles, but his description is considerably simpler, concentrating only on the seven cycles of the present [[Solar System]]. Each of these cycles constitutes a coming into being and passing out of being of the solar system, and each is divided into seven rounds, upon which [[Human|man]] passes through seven root races. Each of Steiner's seven rounds is related to a metamorphosis of the Earth:
* Ancient Saturn
:During the Ancient Saturn round, the life wave of human beings underwent the mineral stage, endowed only with a physical vehicle.
* Ancient Sun
:During the Ancient Sun round, human beings underwent the plant stage, being endowed with a physical and an etheric vehicle.
* Ancient Moon
:During the Ancient Moon round, human beings underwent the animal stage, endowed with a physical, an etheric, and an astral vehicle. Meanwhile, the present Angels were undergoing the human stage, while the present Archangels were undergoing the Angel stage, and so on.
* Earth
:During the Earth round, human beings undergo the man stage.
* Jupiter
:During the Jupiter round, human beings will undergo the soul man stage.
* Venus
:During the Venus round, human beings will undergo the higher soul man stage.
* Vulcan
:During the Vulcan round, human beings will undergo the spiritual man stage.
For Steiner, the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms represent "cast off" elements of the human entity from previous rounds. These teachings have been incorporated into the [[Anthroposophical Society]] that Steiner founded.

==Rosicrucian==
According to [[Max Heindel]]'s [[Rosicrucian]] writings about the scheme of evolution, in the beginning of a ''Day of Manifestation'' a certain collective Great Being, [[God]], limits Himself to a certain portion of space, in which He elects to create a [[Solar System]] for the evolution of added [[self-consciousness]]. In God there are contained hosts of glorious Hierarchies and lesser beings of every grade of intelligence and stage of [[consciousness]], from [[omniscience]] to an [[unconsciousness]] deeper than that of the deepest [[altered state of consciousness|trance condition]].
During the current period of manifestation these various grades of beings are working to acquire more experience than they possessed at the beginning of this period of existence. Those who, in previous manifestations, have attained to the highest degree of development work on those who have not yet evolved any consciousness.

The period of time devoted to the attainment of self-consciousness and to the building of the vehicles through which the spirit in man manifests, is called "[[Involution (esoterism)|Involution]]". The succeeding period of existence, during which the individual human being develops self-consciousness into divine [[omniscience]], is called "[[Spiritual evolution|Evolution]]". Every evolving being has within him a "force" within which makes evolution not to be a mere unfoldment of latent germinal possibilities but a process where each individual differ from that of every other. This force, called "Epigenesis" provides the element of [[originality]] and gives scope to the creative ability which the evolving being is to cultivate that he may become a [[God]].

Heindel states that in the [[Solar system]], God's Habitation, there are [[Rosicrucian Fellowship#The Seven Worlds &amp; the Seven Cosmic Planes|seven Worlds]] differentiated by [[God]], within Himself, one after another. These Worlds have each a different "measure" and rate of [[oscillation|vibration]] and are not separated by [[space]] or [[distance]], as is the earth from the other planets. They are states of [[matter]], of varying [[density]] and vibration (as are the [[solids]], [[liquids]] and [[gases]] of the [[Earth|physical Earth]]). These Worlds are not instantaneously created at the beginning of a day of Manifestation, nor do they last until the end. The evolutionary scheme is carried through five of these Worlds in seven great Periods of manifestation, during which the evolving virgin [[spirit]] becomes first [[human]] and, then, a [[God]].
The highest Worlds are created first, and as [[Involution (metaphysics)|involution]] is to slowly carry the life into denser and denser matter for the building of forms, the finer Worlds gradually [[condense]] and new Worlds are differentiated within [[God]] to furnish the necessary links between Himself and the Worlds which have consolidated. In due time the point of greatest density, the [[nadir]] of materiality, is reached. From that point the life begins to ascend into higher Worlds, as [[Spiritual evolution|evolution]] proceeds. That leaves the denser Worlds depopulated, one by one. When the purpose has been served for which a particular World was created, [[God]] ends its existence, which has become superfluous, by ceasing within Himself the particular activity which brought into being and sustained that World.

[[Image:Serial position.png|thumb|250px|Graph showing the U-shaped serial-position curve, created by the serial-position effect.]]
'''Serial-position effect''' is the tendency of a person to recall the first and last items in a series best, and the middle items worst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Dictionary of Psychology (Second Edition) | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Coleman, Andrew | year=2006 | pages=688}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] through studies he performed on himself, and refers to the finding that [[Precision and recall|recall]] accuracy varies as a function of an item's position within a study list.&lt;ref name=Ebbinghaus&gt;{{cite book|last=Ebbinghaus|first=Hermann|title=On memory: A contribution to experimental psychology|year=1913|publisher=Teachers College|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked to recall a list of items in any order ([[free recall]]), people tend to begin recall with the end of the list, recalling those items best (the '''recency effect'''). Among earlier list items, the first few items are recalled more frequently than the middle items (the '''primacy effect''').&lt;ref&gt;Deese and Kaufman (1957) ''Serial effects in recall of unorganized and sequentially organized verbal material'', J Exp Psychol. 1957 Sep;54(3):180-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Murdock /&gt;

One suggested reason for the primacy effect is that the initial items presented are most effectively stored in [[long-term memory|dormant memory]] because of the greater amount of processing devoted to them. (The first list item can be rehearsed by itself; the second must be rehearsed along with the first, the third along with the first and second, and so on.) The primacy effect is reduced when items are presented quickly and is enhanced when presented slowly (factors that reduce and enhance processing of each item and thus permanent storage). Longer presentation lists have been found to reduce the primacy effect.&lt;ref name="Murdock"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murdock|first=Bennet|date=|year=1962|title=Serial Position Effect of Free Recall|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f518/20619ca42c5799f3c5acc3855671b905419c.pdf|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=64|issue=5|pages=482–488|doi=10.1037/h0045106|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One theorised reason for the recency effect is that these items are still present in [[working memory|activated memory]] when recall is solicited. Items that benefit from neither (the middle items) are recalled most poorly. An additional explanation for the recency effect is related to temporal context: if tested immediately after rehearsal, the current temporal context can serve as a retrieval cue, which would predict more recent items to have a higher likelihood of recall than items that were studied in a different temporal context (earlier in the list).&lt;ref name="Howard and Kahana 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howard|first=Marc W.|author2=Michael J. Kahana |title=A Distributed Representation of Temporal Context|journal=Journal of Mathematical Psychology|year=2002|doi=10.1006/jmps.2001.1388|volume=46|pages=269–299}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recency effect is reduced when an interfering task is given. Intervening tasks involve working memory, as the distractor activity, if exceeding 15 to 30 seconds in duration, can cancel out the recency effect.&lt;ref name="Bjork and Whitten"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bjork|first=Robert A.|author2=William B. Whitten |title=Recency-Sensitive Retrieval Processes in Long-Term Free Recall|journal=Cognitive Psychology|year=1974|volume=6|pages=173–189|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(74)90009-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, if recall comes immediately after test, the recency effect is consistent regardless of the length of the studied list,&lt;ref name="Murdock"/&gt; or presentation rate.&lt;ref name="Murdock and Metcalf"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murdock|first=Bennet|author2=Janet Metcalf |title=Controlled Rehearsal in Single-Trial Free Recall|journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior|year=1978|volume=17|pages=309–324|doi=10.1016/s0022-5371(78)90201-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amnesiacs]] with poor ability to form permanent long-term memories do not show a primacy effect, but do show a recency effect if recall comes immediately after study.&lt;ref name="Carlesimo et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carlesimo|first=Giovanni |author2=G.A. Marfia |author3=A. Loasses |author4=C.

==Primacy effect==
The primacy effect, in [[psychology]] and [[sociology]], is a [[cognitive bias]] that results in a subject recalling primary information presented better than information presented later on. For example, a subject who reads a sufficiently long list of words is more likely to remember words toward the beginning than words in the middle.

Many researchers tried to explain this phenomenon through [[free recall]] [null tests]. Coluccia, Gamboz, and Brandimonte (2011) explain free recall as participants try to remember information without any prompting. In some experiments in the late 20th century it was noted that participants who knew that they were going to be tested on a list presented to them would rehearse items: as items were presented, the participants would repeat those items to themselves and as new items were presented, the participants would continue to rehearse previous items along with the newer items. It was demonstrated that the primacy effect had a greater influence on recall when there was more time between presentation of items so that participants would have a greater chance to rehearse previous (prime) items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glenberg|first=A.M|author2=M.M.

Gretz|title=A two-process account of long-term serial position effects|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory|year=1980|volume=6|pages=355–369|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.6.4.355}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marshall|first=P.H.|author2=P.R.

Overt rehearsal was a technique that was meant to test participants' rehearsal patterns. In an experiment using this technique, participants were asked to recite out loud the items that come to mind. In this way, the experimenter was able to see that participants would repeat earlier items more than items in the middle of the list, thus rehearsing them more frequently and having a better recall of the prime items than the middle items later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rundus|first=D|title=An analysis of rehearsal processes in free recall|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=1971|volume=89|pages=63–77|doi=10.1037/h0031185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another experiment, by Brodie and Murdock, the [[#Recency effect|recency effect]] was found to be partially responsible for the primacy effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brodie|first=D.A.|author2=B.B. Murdock |title=Effects of presentation time on nominal and functional serial-position curves in free recall|journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior|volume=16|pages=185–200|doi=10.1016/s0022-5371(77)80046-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their experiment, they also used the overt-rehearsal technique and found that in addition to rehearsing earlier items more than later items, participants were rehearsing earlier items later on in the list. In this way, earlier items were closer to the test period by way of rehearsal and could be partially explained by the recency effect.

In 2013, a study showed that primacy effect is also prominent in [[decision making]] based on experience in a repeated-choice paradigm, a learning process also known as [[operant conditioning]]. The authors showed that importance attached to the value of the first reward on subsequent behaviour, a phenomenon they denoted as [[Outcome Primacy|outcome primacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shteingart|first=Hanan|author2=Tal Neiman |author3=Yonatan Loewenstein |title=The Role of First Impression in Operant Learning|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|issue=2|pages=476–488|url = http://elsc.huji.ac.il/sites/default/files/476.pdf|doi = 10.1037/a0029550|year = 2013|volume = 142|pmid=22924882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study, participants received one of two sentences. For example, one may be given "Steve is smart, diligent, critical, impulsive, and jealous." and the other "Steve is jealous, impulsive, critical, diligent, and smart." These two sentences contain the same information. The first one suggests positive trait at the beginning while the second one has negative traits. Researchers found that the subjects evaluated Steve more positively when given the first sentence, compared with the second one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Asch | first1 = S | year = 1946 | title = Forming impressions of personality | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 258–290 | doi=10.1037/h0055756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recency effect==
Two traditional classes of theories explain the recency effect.

===Dual-store models===
These models postulate that later study list items are retrieved from a highly accessible short-term buffer, i.e. the [[Short-term memory|short-term store]] (STS) in human [[memory]]. This allows items that are recently studied to have an advantage over those that were studied earlier, as earlier study items have to be retrieved with greater effort from one’s [[Long-term memory|long-term memory store]] (LTS).

An important prediction of such models is that the presentation of a distractor, for example solving [[Arithmetic|arithmetic problems]] for 10–30 seconds, during the retention period (the time between list presentation and test) attenuates the recency effect. Since the STS has limited capacity, the distractor displaces later study list items from the STS so that at test, these items can only be retrieved from the LTS, and have lost their earlier advantage of being more easily retrieved from the short-term buffer. As such, dual-store models successfully account for both the recency effect in immediate recall tasks, and the attenuation of such an effect in the delayed free recall task.

A major problem with this model, however, is that it cannot predict the long-term recency effect observed in delayed recall, when a distractor intervenes between each study item during the [[interstimulus interval]] (continuous distractor task).&lt;ref name="Bjork 1974"&gt;Bjork &amp; Whitten (1974). ''Recency sensitive retrieval processes in long-term free recall'', Cognitive Psychology, 6, 173–189.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the distractor is still present after the last study item, it should displace the study item from STS such that the recency effect is attenuated. The existence of this long-term recency effect thus raises the possibility that immediate and long-term recency effects share a common mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greene | first1 = R. L. | year = 1986 | title = Sources of recency effects in free recall | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 99 | issue = 12| pages = 221–228 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.99.2.221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Single-store models===

According to single-store theories, a single mechanism is responsible for serial-position effects. A first type of model is based on relative temporal distinctiveness, in which the time lag between the study of each list item and the test determines the relative competitiveness of an item’s memory trace at retrieval.&lt;ref name="Bjork 1974"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neath | first1 = I. | last2 = Knoedler | first2 = A. J. | year = 1994 | title = Distinctiveness and serial position effects in recognition and sentence processing | url = | journal = Journal of Memory and Language | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 776–795 | doi=10.1006/jmla.1994.1037}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, end-of-list items are thought to be more distinct, and hence more easily retrieved.

Another type of model is based on contextual variability, which postulates that retrieval of items from memory is cued not only based on one’s mental representation of the study item itself, but also of the study context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Howard | first1 = M. W. | last2 = Kahana | first2 = M. | year = 1999 | title = Contextual variability and serial position effects in free recall | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 923–941 | doi=10.1037/0278-7393.25.4.923}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Howard | first1 = M. W. | last2 = Kahana | first2 = M. J. | year = 2002 | title = A distributed representation of temporal context | url = | journal = Journal of Mathematical Psychology | volume = 46 | issue = 3| pages = 269–299 | doi=10.1006/jmps.2001.1388}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since context varies and increasingly changes with time, on an immediate free-recall test, when memory items compete for retrieval, more recently studied items will have more similar encoding contexts to the test context, and are more likely to be recalled.

Outside immediate free recall, these models can also predict the presence or absence of the recency effect in delayed free recall and continual-distractor free-recall conditions. Under delayed recall conditions, the test context would have drifted away with increasing retention interval, leading to attenuated recency effect. Under continual distractor recall conditions, while increased interpresentation intervals reduce the similarities between study context and test context, the relative similarities among items remains unchanged. As long as the recall process is competitive, recent items will win out, so a recency effect is observed.

===Ratio rule===

Overall, an important [[Empirical research|empirical]] observation regarding the recency effect is that it is not the absolute duration of retention intervals (RI, the time between end of study and test period) or of inter-presentation intervals (IPI, the time between different study items) that matters. Rather, the amount of recency is determined by the [[Rational choice theory|ratio]] of RI to IPI (the ratio rule). As a result, as long as this ratio is fixed, recency will be observed regardless of the absolute values of intervals, so that recency can be observed at all time scales, a phenomenon known as''' time-scale invariance'''. This contradicts dual-store models, which assume that recency depends on the size of STS, and the rule governing the displacement of items in the STS.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Potential explanations either then explain the recency effect as occurring through a single, same mechanism, or re-explain it through a different type of model that postulates two different mechanisms for immediate and long-term recency effects. One such explanation is provided by Davelaar et al. (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davelaar | first1 = E. K. | last2 = Goshen-Gottstein | first2 = Y. | last3 = Ashkenazi | first3 = A. | last4 = Haarmann | first4 = H.

==Related effects==
In 1977, [[William Crano]] decided to outline a study to further the previous conclusions on the nature of order effects, in particular those of primacy vs. recency, which were said to be unambiguous and opposed in their predictions. The specifics tested by Crano were:

;Change of meaning hypothesis: The items on the beginning of a list establish a theme that the participants expect the rest of the list to fall into. The participant modified the meaning of some of the words on the list to fit with the expectation he or she established. Watkins and Peynicioglu (1984) explain this as participants changing the meaning of words, deviating from the established theme, to reduce the amount of deviation in the information presented. 
;Inconsistency discounting: Participants would disregard information that was not consistent with previous items presented to them.  In other words, discounting involves thinking of inconsistent information as having less value than information that is consistent with other information presented (Devine &amp; Ostrom, 1985).
;Attention decrement hypothesis: Information presented first has a greater influence on participants than information that is presented later, causing a primacy effect to occur, even if the information is consistent. Steiner and Rain (1989) explain people pay more attention to information presented at the beginning, but progressively pay less attention to the information presented to them. The primacy effect occurs because participants pay attention to the beginning information and ignore the information presented later. On the other hand, if participants are in a situation where they have to continuously pay attention to information, a recency effect may occur.

The '''continuity effect''' or lag-recency effect predicts that having made a successful recall, the next recalled item is less likely to come from a remote serial position, rather than a nearby serial position (Kahana, Howard, Zaromb &amp; Wingfiend, 2002). The difference between the two items' serial position is referred to as serial-position lag. Another factor, called the conditional-response probability, is the likelihood of recalling a certain serial-position lag. A graph of serial-position lag versus conditional response probability reveals that the next item recalled minimizes absolute lag, with a higher likelihood for the adjacent than the previous one.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2619">In [[mathematics]], a '''shelling''' of a [[simplicial complex]] is a way of gluing it together from its maximal simplices (simplices that are not a face of another simplex) in a well-behaved way. A complex admitting a shelling is called '''shellable'''.

==Definition==
A ''d''-dimensional simplicial complex is called '''pure''' if its maximal simplices all have dimension ''d''. Let &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; be a finite or countably infinite simplicial complex. An ordering &lt;math&gt;C_1,C_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of the maximal simplices of &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is a '''shelling''' if the complex &lt;math&gt;B_k:=\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{k-1}C_i\right)\cap C_k&lt;/math&gt; is pure and &lt;math&gt;(\dim C_k-1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional for all &lt;math&gt;k=2,3,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the "new" simplex &lt;math&gt;C_k&lt;/math&gt; meets the previous simplices along some union &lt;math&gt;B_k&lt;/math&gt; of top-dimensional simplices of the boundary of &lt;math&gt;C_k&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;B_k&lt;/math&gt; is the entire boundary of &lt;math&gt;C_k&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;C_k&lt;/math&gt; is called '''spanning'''.

For &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; not necessarily countable, one can define a shelling as a well-ordering of the maximal simplices of &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; having analogous properties.

==Properties==
* A shellable complex is [[homotopy|homotopy equivalent]] to a [[wedge sum]] of [[n-sphere|spheres]], one for each spanning simplex and of corresponding dimension.
* A shellable complex may admit many different shellings, but the number of spanning simplices, and their dimensions, do not depend on the choice of shelling. This follows from the previous property.

==Examples==
* Every [[Coxeter complex]], and more generally every [[building (mathematics)|building]], is shellable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[File:Sky-3.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The sky above the [[cloud]]s]]

The '''sky''' (or '''celestial dome''') is everything that lies above the surface of the [[Earth]], including the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] and [[outer space]].

In the field of [[astronomy]], the sky is also called the [[celestial sphere]]. This is viewed from Earth's surface as an abstract dome on which the [[Sun]], [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, and [[Moon]] appear to be [[diurnal motion|traveling]]. The celestial sphere is conventionally divided into designated areas called [[constellation]]s. Usually, the term ''sky'' is used informally as the point of view from the Earth's surface; however, the meaning and usage can vary. In some cases, such as in discussing the [[weather]], the sky refers to only the lower, more dense portions of the atmosphere.

During [[daylight]], the sky appears to be [[blue]] because [[air]] [[Rayleigh scattering|scatters]] more blue [[sunlight]] than red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=John Tyndall | date=December 1868 |title=On the Blue Colour of the Sky, the Polarization of Skylight, and on the Polarization of Light by Cloudy Matter Generally |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society]] |volume=17 |pages=223–233 |doi=10.1098/rspl.1868.0033 |jstor=112380|url=http://rspl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/17/223.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lord Rayleigh | date=June 1871 |title=On the scattering of light by small particles |journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]] |volume=41, 275 |pages=447–451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=J.G.

During the day, the Sun can be seen in the sky unless obscured by [[cloud]]s. In the [[night sky]] (and to some extent during the day) the Moon, planets and stars are visible in the sky. Some of the natural phenomena seen in the sky are [[cloud]]s, [[rainbow]]s, and [[Polar Aurora|aurorae]]. [[Lightning]] and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] can also be seen in the sky during [[storm]]s. [[Bird]]s, [[insect]]s, [[aircraft]], and [[kite flying|kites]] are often considered to [[Flight|fly]] in the sky. Due to human activities, [[smog]] during the day and [[light pollution]] during the night are often seen above large [[city|cities]].

Except for [[sunlight|light]] that comes directly from the sun, most of the light in the day sky is caused by [[diffuse sky radiation|scattering]], which is dominated by a small-particle limit called [[Rayleigh Scattering]]. The scattering due to [[molecule]] sized particles (as in air) is greater in the forward and backward directions than it is in the lateral direction.{{clarify|date=October 2014|reason=For the non-expert, the relationship between "forward and backward directions" and "the lateral direction" and the spectrum should be made clear.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2x4CAQMEKigC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=molecular+scattering+aerosol+in+atmosphere&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WfVGT-LlFMre0gGpyvH5DQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=molecular%20scattering%20aerosol%20in%20atmosphere&amp;f=false|title=Theoretical Fundamentals of Atmospheric Optics|author=Yu Timofeev|author2=A.

The remaining sunlight,{{clarify|date=October 2014|reason=What's this? Where? And what is the point of mentioning it}} having lost some of its short wavelength components, appears slightly less blue.&lt;ref name="bluesky" /&gt;

Scattering also occurs even more strongly in [[cloud]]s. Individual water droplets exposed to white light will create a set of colored rings.  If a cloud is thick enough, scattering from multiple water droplets will wash out the set of colored rings and create a washed-out white color.{{clarify|date=October 2014|reason=What in the world is "a washed-out white color"?}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Yi8r4qgMV4C&amp;pg=PA427&amp;dq=water+droplet+scattering+light+atmosphere&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2f5GT_zMNaiZ0QGX_MiPDg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=water%20droplet%20scattering%20light%20atmosphere&amp;f=false|title=Fundamentals of atmospheric radiation: an introduction with 400 problems|author=Craig F.

The sky can turn a multitude of colors such as red, orange, purple and yellow (especially near [[sunset]] or [[sunrise]]) when the light must pass through a much longer path (or [[optical depth]]) through the atmosphere.  Scattering effects also partially [[Polarization (waves)|polarize]] light from the sky and are most pronounced at an angle 90° from the sun.  Scattered light from the [[horizon]] travels through as much as 38 times the atmosphere as does light from the [[zenith]], causing a blue [[Image gradient|gradient]]: vivid at the zenith, and pale near the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/science/wonderquest/2001-04-11-bluer-sky.htm|title=Bluer on top|work=[[USA Today]]|date=11 April 2001|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because red light also scatters if there is enough air between the source and the observer causing parts of the sky to change color during a sunset.

The sun is not the only object that may appear less blue in the atmosphere. Far away clouds or snowy mountaintops may appear yellowish. The effect is not very obvious on clear days but is very pronounced when clouds cover the line of sight, reducing the blue hue from scattered sunlight.&lt;ref name="Lynch"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Abp5FdhskAC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=distant+clouds+snow+covered+mountains+appear+yellow+book#v=onepage&amp;q=distant%20clouds%20snow%20covered%20mountains%20appear%20yellow%20book&amp;f=false|title=Color and light in nature|author=David K.

The intensity of the sky varies greatly over the day, and the primary cause of that intensity differs as well. When the sun is well above the horizon, direct scattering of sunlight (Rayleigh scattering) is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. However, in twilight, the period of time between sunset and night and between night and sunrise, the situation is more complicated. [[Green flash]]es and green rays are [[optical phenomenon|optical phenomena]] that occur shortly after [[sunset]] or before [[sunrise]], when a [[green]] spot is visible above the sun, usually for no more than a second or two, or it may resemble a green ray shooting up from the sunset point. Green flashes are a group of phenomena that stem from different causes,&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{cite news | author=Young, A. | url=http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/papers/Zenit/glance.html | title=Green flashes at a glance | date=2006 | work=San Diego State University page | accessdate=5 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of which occur when there is a temperature inversion (when the temperature increases with altitude rather than the normal decrease in temperature with altitude). Green flashes may be observed from any [[altitude]] (even from an aircraft). They are usually seen at an unobstructed [[horizon]], such as over the [[ocean]], but are also seen over cloud tops and mountain tops. Green flashes may also be observed at the horizon in association with the [[Moon]] and bright planets, including [[Venus]] and [[Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nave|first=C.R.|title=Red Sunset, Green Flash|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/redsun.html|work=Georgia State University|publisher=HyperPhysics|accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Connell|first=D.J.K.|title=The green flash and other low sun phenomena|journal=Castel Gandolfo: Vatican Observatory, Ricerche Astronomiche|date=1958|volume=4|page=7|publisher=Harvard|bibcode=1958RA......4.....O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Earth's shadow]] is the [[shadow]] that the [[Earth]] casts on its [[atmosphere]]. This [[atmospheric phenomenon]] is sometimes seen twice a day, around the times of sunset and sunrise.  When the weather conditions and the observer's viewing point permit a clear sight of the horizon, the shadow can be seen as a dark blue or greyish-blue band. Assuming the sky is clear, the Earth's shadow is visible in the half of the sky opposite to the sunset or sunrise, and is seen as a dark blue band right above the [[horizon]]. A related phenomenon is the "[[Belt of Venus]]" or "anti-twilight arch", a pink band that is visible above the dark blue band of the Earth's shadow in the same part of the sky. There is no clear dividing line between the Earth's shadow and the Belt of Venus: one colored band shades into the other in the sky.&lt;ref name=AO&gt;{{cite web|title=Earth's shadow|publisher = Les Cowley |author =Les Cowley|date=2 August 2009|accessdate=15 February 2012|url = http://www.atoptics.co.uk/atoptics/earshad.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=earth-shadow&gt;{{cite book|title=Color and light in nature|author= David K.

Twilight is divided into three segments according to how far the sun is below the horizon, measured in segments of 6°. After sunset the [[civil twilight]] sets in; it ends when the sun drops more than 6° below the horizon. This is followed by the [[nautical twilight]], when the sun is 6° and 12° below the horizon (heights of between −6° and −12°), after which comes the [[astronomical twilight]], defined as the period from −12° to −18°. When the sun drops more than 18° below the horizon, the sky generally attains its minimum brightness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/twilight/index.htm|publisher=[[University of Toronto]]|author=Dr. Irv Bromberg|date=4 April 2011|accessdate=15 February 2012|title=The Duration of Twilight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several sources can be identified as the source of the intrinsic brightness of the sky, namely [[airglow]], indirect scattering of sunlight, scattering of starlight, and artificial [[light pollution]].

== During the night ==
{{Main|Night sky}}
[[File:Polarlicht 2.jpg|thumb|Aurora borealis over Bear Lake, Alaska]]
[[File:Deathvalleysky nps big.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Milky Way]] can be seen as a large band across the night sky, and is distorted into an arch in this 360° [[panorama]].]]

The term night sky refers to the sky as seen at [[night]]. The term is usually associated with [[skygazing]] and [[astronomy]], with reference to views of [[celestial bodies]] such as stars, the Moon, and planets that become visible on a clear night after the Sun has set. Natural light sources in a night sky include [[moonlight]], [[starlight]], and airglow, depending on location and timing.  The fact that the sky is not completely dark at night can be easily observed. Were the sky (in the absence of moon and city lights) absolutely dark, one would not be able to see the silhouette of an object against the sky.

The night sky and studies of it have a historical place in both ancient and modern [[cultures]].  In the past, for instance, [[farmers]] have used the state of the night sky as a [[calendar]] to determine when to plant [[agriculture|crops]].  The [[history of astrology|ancient belief]] in [[astrology]] is generally based on the belief that relationships between heavenly bodies influence or convey information about events on [[Earth]].  The ''scientific'' study of the night sky and bodies observed within it, meanwhile, takes place in the science of astronomy.

Within [[visible-light astronomy]], the visibility of celestial objects in the night sky is affected by light pollution. The presence of the Moon in the night sky has historically hindered astronomical observation by increasing the amount of ambient lighting. With the advent of artificial light sources, however, light pollution has been a growing problem for viewing the night sky. Special filters and modifications to light fixtures can help to alleviate this problem, but for the best views, both professional and amateur optical astronomers seek viewing sites located far from major urban areas.

Within 36&amp;nbsp;hours of the passage of a [[tropical cyclone]]'s center, the pressure begins to fall and a veil of white cirrus clouds approaches from the [[cyclone]]'s direction.  Within 24&amp;nbsp;hours of the closest approach to the center, low clouds begin to move in, also known as the [[bar (tropical cyclone)|bar]] of a tropical cyclone, as the barometric pressure begins to fall more rapidly and the winds begin to increase. Within 18&amp;nbsp;hours of the center's approach, [[squall]]y weather is common, with sudden increases in wind accompanied by rain showers or thunderstorms. Within six hours of the center's arrival, rain becomes continuous. Within an hour of the center, the rain becomes very heavy and the highest winds within the tropical cyclone are experienced. When the center arrives with a strong tropical cyclone, weather conditions improve and the sun becomes visible as the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] moves overhead. Once the system departs, winds reverse and, along with the rain, suddenly increase. One day after the center's passage, the low overcast is replaced with a higher overcast, and the rain becomes intermittent.

Many mythologies have deities especially associated with the sky.

[[Dyeus]] is reconstructed as the god of the sky, or the sky personified, in [[Proto-Indo-European religion]], whence [[Zeus]], the god of the sky and [[thunder]] in [[Greek mythology]] and the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] god of sky and thunder [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].

In [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]], [[Altjira]] (or Arrernte) is the main sky god and also the creator god. In [[Iroquois mythology]], [[Atahensic]] was a sky goddess who fell down to the ground during the creation of the Earth. Many cultures have drawn [[constellation]]s between [[star]]s in the sky, using them in association with [[legend]]s and [[mythology]] about their [[deities]].

{{discrimination sidebar}}

'''''Snob''''' is a pejorative term for a person that believes there is a correlation between [[social status]] and human worth.&lt;ref name=debotton&gt;De Botton, A. (2004), ''Status Anxiety''. London: Hamish Hamilton&lt;/ref&gt; ''Snob'' also refers to a person that feels superiority over those from lower social classes, education levels, or other social areas. The word ''snobbery'' came into use for the first time in England during the 1820s.

A snob is also a tool (an anvil) used by cobblers in the manufacture of footwear.

== Examples ==
Snobs can through time be found ingratiating themselves with a range of prominent groups – soldiers ([[Sparta]], 400 BC), bishops (Rome, 1500), poets (Weimar, 1815), farmers (China, 1967) – for the primary interests of snobs is distinction, and as its definition changes, so, naturally and immediately, will the objects of the snob's admiration.&lt;ref name="debotton" /&gt;

Snobbery existed also in mediaeval feudal aristocratic Europe, when the clothing, manners, language and tastes of every class were strictly codified by customs or law.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} [[Chaucer]], a poet moving in the court circles, noted the provincial French spoken by the Prioress among the [[Canterbury Tales|Canterbury pilgrims]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And French she spoke full fair and fetisly&lt;br&gt;
After the school of Stratford atte Bowe,&lt;br&gt;
For French of Paris was to her unknowe.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

William Rothwell notes "the simplistic contrast between the 'pure' French of Paris and her 'defective' French of Stratford atte Bowe that would invite disparagement".&lt;ref&gt;Rothwell, "Stratford Atte Bowe re-visited" ''The Chaucer Review'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Snobbery surfaced more strongly as the structure of the society changed, and the [[bourgeoisie]] had the possibility to ''imitate'' [[aristocracy]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Snobbery appears when elements of culture are perceived as belonging to an aristocracy or elite, and some people (the snobs) feel that the mere adoption of the fashion and tastes of the elite or aristocracy is sufficient to include someone in the elites, upper classes or aristocracy.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

However, a form of snobbery can be adopted by someone not a part of that group; a [[pseudointellectual|pseudo-intellectual]], a celebrity worshipper, and a poor person idolizing money and the rich are types of snobs who do not base their snobbery on their personal attributes. {{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}Such a snob idolizes and imitates, if possible, the manners, worldview, and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] of a classification of people to which they aspire, but do not belong, and to which they may never belong (wealthy, famous, intellectual, beautiful, etc.).{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Snob victim==
The term "snob" is often misused when describing a "gold-tap owner",&lt;ref name="debotton" /&gt; i.e. a person who insists on displaying (sometimes non-existent) wealth through [[conspicuous consumption]] of luxury goods such as clothes, jewelry, cars etc. Displaying awards or talents in a rude manner, boasting, is a form of snobbery. A popular example of a "snob victim" is the television character [[Hyacinth Bucket]] of the BBC comedy series ''[[Keeping Up Appearances]]''.

== Analysis ==
[[William Hazlitt]] observed, in a culture where deference to class was accepted as a positive and unifying principle,&lt;ref&gt;The social historian [[G.M. Trevelyan]] referred to the deferential principle in British society as "beneficent snobbery", according to Ray 1955:24.&lt;/ref&gt; "Fashion is gentility running away from vulgarity, and afraid of being overtaken by it," adding subversively, "It is a sign the two things are not very far apart."&lt;ref&gt;Hazlitt, ''Conversations with Northcote'', quoted in Gordon N. Ray, "Thackeray's 'Book of Snobs'", ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'' '''10'''.1 (June 1955:22-33) p. 25; Ray examines the context of snobbery in contemporaneous society.&lt;/ref&gt; The English novelist [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Bulwer-Lytton]] remarked in passing, "Ideas travel upwards, ''manners'' downwards."&lt;!--italics in original--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bulwer-Lytton, ''England and the English'', noted in Ray 1955:24.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not the deeply ingrained and fundamentally accepted idea of "one's betters" that has marked snobbery in traditional European and American culture, but "aping one's betters".

Snobbery is a defensive expression of [[Emotional insecurity|social insecurity]], flourishing most where an [[The Establishment|Establishment]] has become less than secure in the exercise of its traditional prerogatives, and thus it was more an organizing principle for Thackeray's glimpses of British society in the threatening atmosphere of the 1840s than it was of Hazlitt, writing in the comparative social stability of the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;See: Ray 1955:25f.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7144">'''Spam poetry''', sometimes called '''spoetry''', is poetic verse composed primarily from the subject lines or content of [[E-mail spam|spam]] e-mail messages.

==History==
Several writers have claimed to have created spam poetry, and consensus has not emerged about a single origin. Some early examples come from a spam poetry competition held in 2000 by the website ''Satire Wire''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://heatherhaley.com/hh2/?tag=spoetry|title=spoetry {{!}} Heather Haley|website=heatherhaley.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satirewire.com/features/poetry_spam/spam_winner.shtml|title=SatireWire - Strictly Spam Category Winner|website=www.satirewire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animator [[Don Hertzfeldt]] began writing spam poems in his production journal in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bitterfilms.com/forum.html|title=don hertzfeldt :: alone in a taxicab in a snowing foreign country at 3 in the morning|website=www.bitterfilms.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translator Jorge Candeias wrote Portuguese "spoems" daily, between 5 May 2003 and 5 May 2004, using spam subject lines as title and inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lampadamagica.blogspot.com/2007/05/spamesia-aqui-est-uma-das-tais-postas.html|title=A Lâmpada Mágica: Spamesia|first=Jorge|last=Candeias|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A book entitled ''Machine Language'' by [[endwar (concrete poet)|endwar]] was published in 2005 by IZEN and was followed by ''Machine Language, Version 2.1'' also by endwar in 2006. The latter edition includes a CD of spoetry read by [[Microsoft Sam]] and set to ambient musical sounds by Michael Truman who also tweaked the automated readings.  Each edition indicates endwar as editor, but in the second edition he has admitted to using [[cut-up technique]] and having combined shorter pieces from the first edition, which lends more authorship to him in his creation.  These pieces were also read at the opening of ''Blends &amp; Bridges'', a concrete and visual poetry show at Gallery 324 in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 1, 2006, by endwar with the sounds by Truman backing.  The experimental poet, endwar, cites his own collaboration with Ficus Strangulensis, the experimental poet, in 1995, ''The Further Last Words of Dutch Schultz'' published by IZEN as an earlier experiment in generating random text poetry, in this case, the software altered text of the bizarre last words of [[Dutch Schultz]] as published in [[The New York Times]] in 1935, as well as the cut-up influences of [[Brion Gysin]] and [[William S. Burroughs]] and even the musicians [[Throbbing Gristle]] and [[David Bowie]].&lt;ref&gt;[intro to ''Machine Language, Version 2.1'', endwar, IZEN, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;  The useful bits of spam for purposes of endwar's variation of spoetry, i.e., the part that is not the advertisement, but the random words assigned to trick spam filters, endwar calls "paratext".  Endwar indicates that, in his view, "the effect of the evolution of paratext is that computers are learning to talk to each other by in some sense imitating human texts."  &lt;ref&gt;[intro to ''Machine Language'', endwar, IZEN, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;  The advertisements are the human-to-human conversation in the same email sources.

A book entitled 'Spam: E-mail Inspired Poems' by [[Ben Myers]] was published in 2008 by Blackheath Books [http://www.blackheathbooks.org.uk/2.html] Myers claims to have been writing spam poems since 1999.

The creation of spoetry is similar to Gysin and Burroughs's cut-up technique in that individual subject lines of messages are pieced together in poetic form; making the creation of spoetry an exercise not in creativity as much as in having an eye for the unexpected.

The end result can be crafted into any literary form the author desires: [[haiku]], [[concrete poetry]], [[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]], [[dada]], and so on.  Thus, spoetry is not a literary form but rather a means of creating poetry.

A related concept is spam lit, where snippets of nonsensical verse and prose are embedded in [[spam (electronic)|spam]] e-mail messages. Some of the snippets are original content, others are passages or conglomerations from [[public domain|public-domain]] works. The term was coined by a member of the Poetics [[listserv]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0209&amp;L=poetics&amp;D=1&amp;H=1&amp;O=D&amp;P=60037|title=Listserv 16.0 - Archives - Error|website=listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2006, [[David Kestenbaum]] of NPR's ''[[Morning Edition]]'' broadcast a story on "Literary Spam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5624749|title=Spam Goes Literary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kestenbaum notes that [[Paul Graham (computer programmer)|Paul Graham]], a programmer, "wrote a program to find out how to best separate spam from real e-mail. To train it, he fed it a good helping of spam and a separate sample of real e-mail." Soon, spammers discovered the works of long-dead poets and writers as one way to circumvent Graham's [[anti-spam]] code.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23139">In [[cognitive psychology]], the '''telescoping effect''' (or '''telescoping bias''') refers to the temporal displacement of an event whereby people perceive recent events as being more remote than they are and distant events as being more recent than they are.&lt;ref name=Janssen&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Janssen |first1=Steve M. J. |last2=Chessa |first2=Antonio G. |last3=Murre |first3=Jaap M. J. |date=2006 |title=Memory for time: How people date events |journal=Memory &amp; Cognition  |doi=10.3758/BF03193393 |volume=34 |pages=138–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former is known as '''backward telescoping''' or '''time expansion''', and the latter as is known as '''forward telescoping'''.&lt;ref name=Janssen/&gt; Three years is approximately the time frame in which events switch from being displaced backward in time to forward in time, with events occurring three years in the past being equally likely to be reported with forward telescoping bias as with backward telescoping bias.&lt;ref name= "Janssen"/&gt; Although telescoping occurs in both the forward and backward directions, in general the effect is to increase the number of events reported too recently.&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;{{cite book |author=National Research Council |title=Cognitive Aspects of Survey Methodology: Building A Bridge Between Disciplines |date=1984 |location=Washington, DC |isbn=0-309-07784-2 |pages=119–125 |url=https://cart.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=930&amp;page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; This net effect in the forward direction is because of forces that impair memory, such as lack of [[Salience (language)|salience]], also impair [[time perception]].&lt;ref name="NRC" /&gt; Telescoping leads to an over reporting of the frequency of events.&lt;ref name=Draa&gt;{{cite book |last1=Draaisma |first1=Douwe |last2=Pomerans |first2=Erica |title=Why life speeds up as you get older: on autobiographical memory |date=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-521-83424-4 |pages=201–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; This over reporting is because participants include events beyond the period, either events that are too recent for the target time period (backward telescoping) or events that are too old for the target time period (forward telescoping).&lt;ref name=Draa/&gt;

[[File:Telescopingmodel.jpg|thumb|Events that occurred more recently than 3 years ago are subject to backward telescoping, and events that occurred more than 3 years in the past are subject to forward telescoping. Events that occurred around the 3 year mark are equally subject to forward as backward telescoping.]]

==Origin of the term==
The original work on telescoping is usually attributed to a 1964 article by Neter and Waksberg in the ''[[Journal of the American Statistical Association]]''.&lt;ref name=Rubin&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rubin |first1=David C. |last2=Baddeley |first2=Alan D. |date=1989 |title=Telescoping is not time compression: A model |journal=Memory &amp; Cognition |doi=10.3758/BF03202626 |volume=17 |issue=6|pages=653–661}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term telescoping comes from the idea that time seems to shrink toward the present in the way that the distance to objects seems to shrink when they are viewed through a telescope.&lt;ref name=Rubin/&gt;

==Real-world example==
A real-world example of the telescoping effect is the case of [[:nl:Ferdi Elsas|Ferdi Elsas]], an infamous kidnapper and murderer in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=Draa2&gt;{{cite book |last1=Draaisma |first1=Douwe |last2=Pomerans |first2=Erica |date=2004 |title=Why life speeds up as you get older: on autobiographical memory |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-521-83424-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was let out of prison, most of the general population did not believe he had been in prison long enough.&lt;ref name=Draa2/&gt; Due to forward telescoping, people thought Ferdi Elsas' sentence started more recently than it actually did.&lt;ref name=Draa2/&gt; Telescoping has important real world applications, especially in survey research. Marketing firms often use surveys to ask when consumers last bought a product, and government agencies often use surveys to discover information about [[drug abuse]] or about [[victimology]].&lt;ref name=Mor&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morwitz |first=Vicki G. |date=1997 |title=It Seems Like Only Yesterday: The Nature and Consequences of Telescoping Errors in Marketing Research |journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology |doi=10.1207/s15327663jcp0601_01 |volume=6 |pages=1–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telescoping may bias answers to these questions.&lt;ref name=Mor/&gt;

==Methods for studying==
Telescoping is studied in psychology by asking participants to recall dates or to estimate the recency of a personal event.&lt;ref name=Mor/&gt; Another procedure that is often used is called the diary procedure, in which participants record personal events in a diary each day for several months.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=Charles P. |last2=Skowronski |first2=John J. |last3=Larsen |first3=Steen F. |last4=Betz |first4=Andrew L. |title=Autobiographical memory: remembering what and remembering when |date=1996 |publisher=Erlbaum |location=Mahwah, NJ |isbn=978-0-8058-1514-6 |pages=131–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the diary is completed, participants are asked to date events and assess how well they remember those events.&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;  Their recollections are then compared to the actual dates and details of the events in order to determine if telescoping has occurred.&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;

==Models and other explanations==
Researchers have examined possible reasons that the telescoping effect occurs.  They have proposed the following hypotheses and models.  The two models that are currently favored are the associative and boundary models.&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt;

===Accessibility hypothesis===
Brown, Rips, and Shevell created the accessibility hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Crawley&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crawley |first1=Susan E. |last2=Pring |first2=Linda |date=2000 |title=When did Mrs Thatcher resign? The effects of ageing on the dating of public events |journal=Memory |doi=10.1080/096582100387650 |pmid=10829127 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=111–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis states that dates are estimated, not recalled, and these estimates are based on what is remembered about the event.&lt;ref name=Crawley/&gt; People use how much detail they recall about an event to infer how long ago the event occurred.&lt;ref name=Mor/&gt; Therefore, memorable events should be recalled as occurring recently.&lt;ref name=Crawley/&gt; Since these memorable events are recalled as occurring more recently, in general people overestimate the recency of events and forward telescoping occurs.&lt;ref name=Crawley/&gt; For example, when people are asked to estimate the dates of the shooting of Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II, which occurred in the same year, they typically estimate that Ronald Reagan's shooting occurred more recently.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Norman R. |last2=Rips |first2=Lance J. |last3=Shevell |first3=Steven K. |date=1985 |title=The subjective dates of natural events in very-long-term memory |journal=Cognitive Psychology  |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(85)90006-4 |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=139–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronald Reagan's shooting is usually a more memorable event and was more heavily publicized, so the memory of this event was more accessible to participants, indicating that accessibility plays a role in the dating of events.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; However, these results are not always replicated, and sometimes the reverse is found.&lt;ref name=Crawley/&gt; For this reason, other explanations have been presented to explain telescoping.

===Conveyor belt model===
Thompson et al. used the conveyor belt model of memory to explain forward telescoping.&lt;ref name=Mor/&gt; It assumes that events are stored in the order that they occur.&lt;ref name=Mor/&gt; When individuals try to remember the date of an event, they scan serially backward through memory.&lt;ref name=Mor/&gt; Since events are only remembered by order or time between events in this model, if an event is forgotten, previous events are recalled as if they occurred more recently and forward telescoping occurs.&lt;ref name=Mor/&gt; Another way of interpreting this theory is that people estimate the dates of events based on the number of personal events that have occurred since the target event.&lt;ref name=Crawley/&gt; Since people underestimate memory loss over long periods of time, target events are moved closer to the present.&lt;ref name=Crawley/&gt; Although this model explains forward telescoping, it does not explain backward telescoping. [[File:Telescoping effect Conveyor Belt Model.jpg|thumb|right| This image portrays the conveyor belt model of the telescoping effect, which assumes that when an event is forgotten, earlier events are recalled as occurring more recently.]]

===Guessing===
Some psychologists have suggested that telescoping occurs because people are guessing the date of an event. According to this theory, if a person is unsure of a date, they minimize their chance of erring by placing events toward the middle of the period.&lt;ref name=Crawley/&gt; However, telescoping occurs at the same frequency if events are remembered well or if events are not remembered well.&lt;ref name=Thompson2&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thompson |first1=Charles P. |last2=Skowronski |first2=John J. |last3=Lee |first3=D. John |date=1988 |title=Telescoping in dating naturally occurring events |journal=Memory &amp; Cognition  |doi=10.3758/BF03214227 |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=461–468}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, guessing is not a complete explanation for telescoping, and another one of these models is likely responsible.

===Boundary model===
Rubin and Baddley created the boundary model to explain telescoping. When people date events, they often get information from a bounded period, such as a year or a vacation.&lt;ref name="Th book"&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Charles P. |editor-last=Thompson |title=Autobiographical memory: theoretical and applied perspectives |date=1998 |publisher=Erlbaum |location=Mahwah |isbn=978-0-8058-2795-8 |edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model assumes events are not assigned outside of the boundaries of this period, so dating errors can only move toward the middle of a boundary and that since recent events are dated more accurately, forward telescoping has a stronger effect.&lt;ref name=Thompson2/&gt; It postulates that, without boundaries, an estimation would be unbiased.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=Peter James |last2=Brown |first2=Norman R. |date=2004 |title=The role of guessing and boundaries on date estimation biases |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review |doi=10.3758/BF03196630 |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=748–754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Boundarymodeltelescoping.jpg|thumb|left| This image explains the boundary model of the telescoping effect. The boundary model states that telescoping is the result of dating errors moving toward the middle of a bounded period]]

There is some evidence against the boundary model. A study by Lee and Brown in 2004 looked at how four different groups dated news events under different conditions.&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Cohen |editor1-first=Gillian |editor-last2=Conway |editor-first2=Martin|title=Memory in the real world |edition=Updated |date=2008 |publisher=Psychology Press |location=Hove |isbn=1-84169-641-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that the different boundaries had no effect on date estimation, and the existence of a boundary had no effect on date estimation.&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt; This study suggests that telescoping is not due solely to boundaries.

===Associative model===
Simon Kemp proposed the associative model to explain telescoping without using boundaries.&lt;ref name= "Friedman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=William J.|author2=Janssen, Steve M.J. |title=Aging and the speed of time|journal=Acta Psychologica |date=2010|volume=134|pages=130–141|doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2010.01.004|issue=2|pmid=20163781}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kemp argued that people use an association strategy that links target events to other events for which dating information is available.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; According to Kemp, this association leads to a [[Regression toward the mean|regression to the mean]] of known dates.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; This approach assumes that the date of an event is determined by using memories from other similar events, that ability to recall relevant information decreases overtime, and that the associated event is more likely to be more recent than the actual event because the ability to retrieve information decreases overtime.&lt;ref name= "Lee"/&gt;

A variation of this theory is the [[prototype]] model. This model states that prototypes can aid the process of dating events.&lt;ref name= "Kemp"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kemp|first=Simon|title=Association as a Cause of Dating Bias|journal=Memory|date=1996 |volume=4|issue=2|pages=131–1431|doi= 10.1080/096582196389004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prototype event is a general event.&lt;ref name= "Kemp"/&gt; For example, a specific event could be the assassination of John F. Kennedy and a prototype event could be the assassination of a world leader.&lt;ref name= "Kemp"/&gt; People can use associated prototype events to help them recall events in the same way they use normal events.

Although the prototype model is based on general events and the associative model is based on actual events, both have been supported in experiments.&lt;ref name= "Kemp"/&gt; Participants are worse at estimating the dates of events if they have to date events spontaneously, without using context or associated events, and prototype event estimates resemble spontaneously estimated events.&lt;ref name= "Kemp"/&gt; The associative model does not predict what occurs if a person has never heard of an event and cannot predict what sort of biasing will occur for these responses.&lt;ref name= "Lee"/&gt; Therefore, the associative model, like the boundary effect model, cannot explain all aspects of telescoping but can explain new aspects of telescoping.

===Other explanations===
'''Heuristics'''
{{main|Heuristics}}

Some psychologists suggest telescoping errors are due to the heuristics used to answer dating and frequency questions. When asked questions about frequency, people often answer using phrases like "all the time" and "everyday" and therefore don't account for exceptions.&lt;ref name="Mor"/&gt; Depending on the events in question, this could lead to an over or under estimation of the occurrence of an event, and be perceived as telescoping.&lt;ref name="Mor"/&gt; This over reporting is a result of telescoping because telescoping causes participants include events beyond the period.&lt;ref name= "Draa"/&gt; Therefore, heuristics may be responsible for some of the telescoping errors.

'''Demand characteristics'''
{{main|Demand characteristics}}
Other psychologists believe that the telescoping errors that have been reported in studies are not due to a phenomenon of memory, but demand characteristics.&lt;ref name="Mor"/&gt; Responses to questions about the frequency of behavior can be biased because of demand characteristics.&lt;ref name="Mor"/&gt; Respondents may provide too much information, rather than too little, because they are trying to provide as much useful information as possible, and therefore over-report the frequency of events.&lt;ref name="Mor"/&gt; Some researchers perceive this over reporting as telescoping because people are including events beyond the given period, but the over reporting could be due to the demand characteristics of the study.&lt;ref name="Mor"/&gt;  Demand characteristics can explain the appearance of forward telescoping, but cannot explain backwards telescoping and can not explain the inaccurate recall of dates when respondents are not led to believe that a certain answer is desirable.&lt;ref name="Mor"/&gt;

==Modifiers of effect==

===Development===

Psychologists have studied the telescoping effect in children because a person's development can have a significant impact on his or her memory.  Telescoping occurs at all ages, but to different degrees.&lt;ref name= "Wang"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Qi|author2=Peterson, Carole |author3=Hou, Yubo |title=Children dating childhood memories|journal=Memory|date=1 October 2010|volume=18|pages=754–762|doi=10.1080/09658211.2010.508749|issue=7|pmid=20818575}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Older children have a greater tendency to telescope earlier memories and a weaker tendency to telescope recent memories than younger children.&lt;ref name= "Wang"/&gt;  Children's telescoping errors occur for their earliest memories.&lt;ref name= "Wang"/&gt; This finding is significant because it probably occurs for adults as well, and therefore people's earliest memories are reported as more recent than they actually are. This finding indicates that the earliest memories reported in [[childhood amnesia]] literature should be questioned because they may have occurred earlier than they are reported.&lt;ref name= "Wang"/&gt;

Many older adults claim time speeds up as they get older, which can be explained by forward telescoping.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt;  Since forward telescoping leads people to underestimate the amount of time that has occurred since an event, people may feel as if time has passed quickly when they discover the true amount of time since that event.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt;  This explanation is one reason for why people perceive time as moving faster as they age, but it does not take into account changes in the amount of telescoping that occurs with age.  People are best at accurately identifying dates when they are ages 35–50.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt;  Participants age 60 and older show a decrease in the degree of forward telescoping and tend to date events too remotely instead of too recently.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; The sensation of time speeding up may be derived from the fact that time is subjectively longer and therefore people assume that the time must be going by more quickly.&lt;ref name= "Draa2"/&gt;

===Minimizing the effect===
The way a question is phrased is an important factor in minimizing the telescoping effect. If a question clearly defines the time period of interest, telescoping errors will be reduced.&lt;ref name="Mor"/&gt; Also, if a question is more specific or difficult, it requires more [[reconstructive memory|reconstructive processes]]; therefore, the answers to these questions will include less telescoping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prohaska|first=Vincent|author2=Brown, Norman R. |author3=Belli, Robert F. |title=Forward Telescoping: The Question Matters|journal=Memory|year=1998|volume=6|pages=455–465|doi=10.1080/741942604|issue=4|pmid=9829101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neter and Waksberg also developed a procedure called bounded recall to help decrease the effect of telescoping.&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt; In preliminary interviews, participants are asked about events, and then, in later interviews, participants are reminded of these events and then asked about additional occurrences.&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt; One limitation of this process is that it requires information from preliminary interviews be correct.&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt;

A person's temporal framework is also related to the amount of telescoping errors that they make.&lt;ref name= "Janssen"/&gt; As a person's temporal framework becomes more elaborate, they have more reference points from which to date events and commit fewer telescoping errors.&lt;ref name= "Janssen"/&gt;

==Implications==

===Substance use===
The telescoping effect is pertinent for behaviors such as smoking and alcohol usage, especially when they are early onset behaviors.  Studies of the telescoping effect have examined the reported age of onset of [[smoking]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], and drug use.  Forward telescoping has been found in reported age of initial use of cigarettes and in reported age of beginning daily smoking.&lt;ref name= "Johnson3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Eric O.|author2=Schultz, Lonni |title=Forward telescoping bias in reported age of onset: an example from cigarette smoking|journal=International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research|date=2005|volume=14|pages=119–129|doi=10.1002/mpr.2|issue=3|pmid=16389888}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, people may be misclassified as having late onset of drug use, when in reality, they had early onset.&lt;ref name="Johnson3" /&gt;  Forward telescoping of risky behaviors can be problematic in monitoring patients for issues associated with early onset drug use because if they are misclassified, they may not be correctly monitored.&lt;ref name="Johnson3" /&gt;  The same effect of forward telescoping is found for [[marijuana]], alcohol, and hard drug usage.&lt;ref name=Golub&gt;{{cite journal|last=Golub|first=Andrew|author2=Johnson, Bruce D. |author3=Labouvie, Eric |journal=Journal of Quantitative Criminology|date=2000|volume=16|pages=45–68|doi=10.1023/A:1007573411129|pmid=21544259|title=On Correcting Biases in Self-Reports of Age at First Substance Use with Repeated Cross-Section Analysis|issue=1|pmc=3085261}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implications of forward telescoping on these behaviors are similar to those of smoking.&lt;ref name=Golub/&gt;

In the [[United States]], in the 1950s, a telescoping effect was observed with women entering alcohol abuse treatment programs with shorter histories than their male counterparts, but with symptoms of equivalent severity.&lt;ref name="M.D.Seeman2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Romans|first1=Sarah E. |last2=Seeman|first2=Mary V.|title=Women's Mental Health: A Life-Cycle Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=azXsnaRdDRQC&amp;pg=PA182|accessdate=23 March 2013|year=2006|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-5129-2|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forward telescoping of alcohol histories is still prevalent today and has since been observed in opiate abuse and [[pathological gambling]].&lt;ref name="M.D.Seeman2006"/&gt; Several theories have been suggested to explain the effect, though the exact mechanism remains unclear.&lt;ref name="BradyBack2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brady|first1=Kathleen T.|last2=Back|first2=Sudie E.|last3=Greenfield|first3=Shelly F.|title=Women and Addiction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=euKt9az2tUIC&amp;pg=PA345|accessdate=23 March 2013|date=2 April 2009|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-60623-403-7|pages=344–345}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--expand with theories--&gt;

===Marketing===
{{main|Marketing}}

Marketing firms often use survey data to estimate when consumers will next buy a product. Telescoping errors may bias these estimates and cause faulty marketing campaigns. Respondents on marketing research surveys are often inaccurate when recalling the time period of their last purchase, and forward telescoping is common.&lt;ref name="Mor"/&gt; Backward telescoping is also common and leads to respondents overstating their intention to buy a replacement product as they underestimate the likelihood of their product breaking down.&lt;ref name="Mor"/&gt; Telescoping has a significant effect on market research and therefore should be taken into account in marketing strategies.

In [[argumentation theory]], a '''term''' is that part of a statement in an argument which refers to a specific thing. Usually, but not always expressed as a [[noun]], one of the requirements to informally prove a conclusion with a [[deductive argument]] is for all its terms to be used [[unambiguous]]ly. The ambiguous use of a term in a deductive argument may be an instance of the [[fallacy of four terms]].

==Plot==
Tom Sherbourne, a [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|traumatised and withdrawn]] hero of [[World War I]], is hired as a [[lighthouse keeper|lightkeeper]] at Janus Rock, a lighthouse off the coast of [[Western Australia]]. He falls in love with a local girl, Isabel Graysmark, and they marry in 1921. Isabel loses two pregnancies in three years and fears she may never become a mother.

Shortly after Isabel's second [[miscarriage]], a rowboat containing a dead man and a newborn baby girl washes ashore near the lighthouse. Tom knows that regulations require him to report the discovery. However, Isabel fears that the baby will almost certainly be sent to an [[orphanage]] and persuades Tom to pass the baby off as their own. Tom grudgingly agrees. He buries the man on the island, and the couple names the girl Lucy.

As Tom and Isabel are about to have Lucy [[Infant baptism|christened]] on the mainland, Tom sees a woman, Hannah Roennfeldt, kneeling in front of a grave bearing the names of Frank Roennfeldt and his baby daughter Grace Ellen, who were lost at sea on the day they found Lucy, 26 April 1923. Tom fears that Lucy might very well be Hannah's missing daughter. He writes anonymously to Hannah to tell her that her husband is dead but that her baby is safe and well cared-for.

Four years later, Tom, Isabel, and Lucy, who have enjoyed an idyllic life together, attend a ceremony for the anniversary of Tom's lighthouse, and they strike up a conversation with Hannah and her sister, Gwen Potts. They learn that Frank was a German, that Hannah's marrying him so soon after the First World War was controversial, and that he had been accosted in the street by a drunken crowd. He jumped into a rowboat and fled with his baby daughter. 

Tormented by his conscience, Tom sends Hannah a small rattle that was found with Lucy on the boat. One of Tom's co-workers recognizes the rattle on a reward poster and reports him to the police.

Tom takes full responsibility, claiming he bullied Isabel into complying. Isabel is enraged that Tom is willing to give Lucy away and breaks off contact with him after his arrest.  Lucy is returned to her birth family but initially rejects and hates them, having no memory of them. She refuses to answer to "Grace" and even runs away in an effort to return to the lighthouse.

The police accuse Tom of murdering Frank and are unable to draw an answer from the distraught Isabel as to whether or not Frank was dead when they discovered him. Lucy runs away to look for the lighthouse, and a search team is sent to rescue her. She is found and returned to Hannah, but the events lead Hannah to realize that Lucy now belongs to Isabel. 

Hannah promises to return Lucy to Isabel as soon as Isabel testifies against Tom. Just as Tom is about to be taken by boat to [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] for trial, Isabel reads a letter which Tom had sent her, confiding he had not deserved his happiness with Lucy and how carrying the blame will assuage his [[survivor guilt|guilt for surviving the war]]. 

Isabel jumps on the boat and confesses everything. Moved by their gesture and reminded by Frank's words to always forgive others, Hannah offers to speak on their behalf at trial. Lucy has at last begun to bond with her biological mother and grandfather, who agrees to call her "Lucy-Grace" as a compromise.

In 1950, an adult Lucy-Grace Rutherford, accompanied by her baby son Christopher, tracks Tom down. She has not been in contact with the Sherbournes for over twenty years, as they had agreed not to contact her for the rest of her childhood. Isabel has recently died, still tormented with guilt for her actions, and Tom gives Lucy-Grace a letter that Isabel had written in case Lucy ever made contact. An emotional Lucy-Grace thanks Tom, the only father she knew, for rescuing and raising her for the few years on Janus, and she asks if she can visit again. She and Tom embrace before she leaves.

*This article contains a section '''flagged for [[WP:MERGE|merge]]''' (See [[#Knockout tournaments|below]]). &lt;small&gt;(October 2015)&lt;/small&gt;
}}

A '''tournament''' is a [[competition]] involving a relatively large number of competitors, all participating in a [[sport]] or [[game]]. More specifically, the term may be used in either of two overlapping senses:
# One or more competitions held at a single venue and concentrated into a relatively short time interval.
# A competition involving a number of matches, each involving a subset of the competitors, with the overall tournament winner determined based on the combined results of these individual matches. These are common in those sports and games where each match must involve a small number of competitors: often precisely two, as in most [[team sport]]s, [[racket sport]]s and [[combat sport]]s, many [[card game]]s and [[board game]]s, and many forms of [[debate|competitive debating]]. Such tournaments allow large numbers to compete against each other in spite of the restriction on numbers in a single match.

These two senses are distinct. All [[golf tournament]]s meet the first definition, but while [[match play]] tournaments meet the second, [[stroke play]] tournaments do not, since there are no distinct matches within the tournament. In contrast, [[football (soccer)|association football]] leagues like the [[Premier League]] are tournaments in the second sense, but not the first, having matches spread across many stadia over a period of up to a season. Many tournaments meet both definitions; for example, the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon tennis championship]]. Tournaments "are temporally demarcated events, participation in which confers levels of status and prestige amongst all participating members"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Alex|last2=Stringfellow|first2=Lindsay|last3=Maclean|first3=Mairi|last4=MacLaren|first4=Andrew|last5=O’Gorman|first5=Kevin|date=2015-03-24|title=Puppets of necessity? Celebritisation in structured reality television|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0267257X.2014.988282|journal=Journal of Marketing Management|volume=31|issue=5–6|pages=478–501|doi=10.1080/0267257X.2014.988282|issn=0267-257X}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A '''tournament-match''' (or '''''tie''''' or '''''fixture''''' or '''''heat''''') may involve multiple game-matches (or '''''rubbers''''' or '''''legs''''') between the competitors. For example, in the [[Davis Cup]] [[tennis]] tournament, a tie between two nations involves five rubbers between the nations' players. The team that wins the most rubbers wins the tie. In the later rounds of [[UEFA Champions League]] , each fixture is [[two-legged tie|played over two legs]]. The scores of each leg are added, and the team with the higher aggregate score wins the fixture, with [[away goals rule|away goals]] used as a tiebreaker and a [[Penalty shootout (football)|penalty shoot out]] if away goals cannot determine a winner of the game.

=={{anchor|Knockout}}&lt;!-- [[Knockout tournament]] [[elimination tournament]] redirect here--&gt;Knockout tournaments==
A '''knockout tournament''' or '''elimination tournament''' is divided into successive rounds; each competitor plays in at least one fixture per round. The top-ranked competitors in each fixture progress to the next round. As rounds progress, the number of competitors and fixtures decreases. The final round, usually known as the final or cup final, consists of just one fixture; the winner of which is the overall champion.

In a [[single-elimination tournament]], only the top-ranked competitors in a fixture progress; in 2-competitor games, only the winner progresses. All other competitors are eliminated. This ensures a winner is decided with the minimum number of fixtures. However, most competitors will be eliminated after relatively few matches; a single bad or unlucky performance can nullify many preceding excellent ones.

A [[double-elimination tournament]] may be used in 2-competitor games to allow each competitor a single loss without being eliminated from the tournament. All losers from the main [[bracket (tournament)|bracket]] enter a losers' bracket, the winner of which plays off against the main bracket's winner.

A triple elimination tournament allows a competitor to lose two games, and creates a third bracket or fourth bracket, and are usually followed by a playoff. It is usually used in [[curling]] tournaments. 

Some elimination tournaments are in a [[Playoff format#Best-of formats|best-of-''x'' series]], allowing a competitor to lose at most four times (to the same competitor) before being eliminated.

Some formats use a [[repechage]], allowing losers to play extra rounds before re-entering the main competition in a later round. [[Sport rowing|Rowing]] [[regatta]]s often have repechage rounds for the "fastest losers" from the heats. The winners of these progress, but are at a disadvantage in later rounds owing to the extra effort expended during the repechage.

A [[McIntyre System|family of tournament systems]] that grew from a system devised for the Victorian Football League, the historic predecessor to the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL), allow the teams with the best record before the playoffs to lose a game without being eliminated, whereas lesser qualifiers are not. Several of the most prominent leagues in Australia use such a system, such as the AFL and the [[National Rugby League]] in rugby league. The [[A-League]] of association football also used such a system through its 2011–12 season, but now uses a pure knockout playoff. Similar systems are used in cricket's [[Indian Premier League]] and most [[curling]] tournaments, and were also used by the [[Super League]] of European rugby league before being scrapped after the 2014 season.

In [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] meetings, fastest losers may progress in a running event held over several rounds; e.g. the qualifiers for a later round might be the first 4 from each of 6 heats, plus the 8 fastest losers from among the remaining runners.

An extreme form of the knockout tournament is the stepladder format where the strongest team (or individual, depending on the sport) is assured of a berth at the final round while the next strongest teams are given byes according to their strength/seeds; for example, in a four team tournament, the fourth and third seed figure in the first round, then the winner goes to the semifinals against the second seed, while the survivor faces the first seed at the final. Four American sports organizations either currently use this format, or have in the past:
* Since the mid-1960s, most [[ten-pin bowling]] events use a stepladder final, usually involving five bowlers.
* Two U.S. college conferences operate a tournament format in basketball that combines two stepladder tournaments into one—that is, both halves of the bracket are organized as stepladder tournaments. When eight teams are involved in the tournament, the bottom four teams play in the first round; the survivors will face the #3 and #4 seeds, and the winners of those matches take on the top two seeds in the semifinals. This format was used by the [[West Coast Conference]] (WCC) for its men's and women's tournaments from 2003 through 2013, and has been used by the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] (OVC) for both sexes since 2011. From 2019 forward, the WCC tournaments will return to the aforementioned format, but add an extra round so that all 10 current conference members will participate (note that the OVC tournament does not involve all of the league's members, currently 12).
* In the Philippines, the [[UAAP Basketball Championship]] and the [[NCAA Basketball Championship (Philippines)|NCAA Basketball Championship]] both use the stepladder format if a team wins all elimination round (regular season) games. This format has been adopted to other sports in both leagues. If no team wins all elimination round games, the playoffs remains in the usual two-round playoff format.
* The now-defunct [[Women's Professional Soccer]] used this format in all of its three seasons of existence. For an example of its playoff system, see [[2009 Women's Professional Soccer Playoffs]].

==Group tournaments==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Division (sport)]] --&gt;
A group tournament, [[League system|league]], [[Division (sport)|division]] or [[conference (sports)|conference]] involves all competitors playing a number of ''fixtures'' (again, a fixture is one name for a tournament-match that determines who, out of two or three or more, will advance; a fixture may consist of one or more game-matches between competitors). Points are awarded for each fixture, with competitors ranked based either on total number of points or average points per fixture. Usually each competitor plays an equal number of fixtures, in which case rankings by total points and by average points are equivalent. The English [[County Championship]] in cricket did not require an equal number of matches prior to 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.cricinfo.com/db/NATIONAL/ENG/CHAMPIONSHIP/CC_HISTORY.html County Championship history] [[Cricinfo]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[round-robin tournament]], each competitor plays all the others an equal number of times, once in a single round-robin tournament and twice in a double round-robin tournament. This is often seen as producing the most reliable rankings. However, for large numbers of competitors it may require an unfeasibly large number of rounds. A [[Swiss system tournament]] attempts to determine a winner reliably, based on a smaller number of fixtures. Fixtures are scheduled one round at a time; a competitor will play another who has a similar record in previous rounds of the tournament. This allows the top (and bottom) competitors to be determined with fewer rounds than a round-robin, though the middle rankings are unreliable.

There may be other considerations besides reliability of rankings. In some [[professional sport|professional]] team sports, weaker teams are given an easier slate of fixtures as a form of [[handicapping]]. Sometimes schedules are weighted in favour of [[local derby|local derbies]] or other [[sports rivalry|traditional rivalries]]. For example, NFL teams play two games against each of the other three teams in their division, one game against half of the other twelve teams in their conference, and one game against a quarter of the sixteen teams in the other conference.

American sports are also unusual in providing fixtures between competitors who are, for ranking purposes, in different groups.  Another, systematic, example of this was the [[2006 Women's Rugby World Cup]]: each of the teams in Group A played each of the teams in Group B, with the groups ranked separately based on the results. (Groups C and D intertwined similarly.)  An elaboration of this system is the Mitchell movement in duplicate bridge, discussed [[#Bridge tournaments|below]], where North-South pairs play East-West pairs.

{{main|Group tournament ranking system}}
In 2-competitor games where [[tie (draw)|tie]]s are rare or impossible, competitors are typically ranked by number of wins, with ties counting half; each competitors' listings are usually ordered Wins–Losses(–Ties). Where ties are more common, this may be 2 points for a win and 1 for a tie, which is mathematically equivalent but avoids having too many half-points in the listings. These are usually ordered Wins–Ties–Losses. If there are more than two competitors per fixture, points may be ordinal (for example, 3 for first, 2 for second, 1 for third).

==Multi-stage tournaments==
{{anchor|Group stage}}&lt;!--[[Group stage]] redirects here--&gt;
Many tournaments are held in multiple stages, with the top teams in one stage progressing to the next. American professional team sports have a "regular season" (group tournament) acting as qualification for the "post season" or "[[playoffs]]" (single-elimination tournament). A '''group stage''' (also known as '''pool play''' or the '''pool stage''') is a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] stage in a multi-stage tournament. The competitors are divided into multiple groups, which play separate round-robins in parallel. Measured by a [[Group tournament ranking system|points-based ranking system]], the top competitors in each group qualify for the next stage.  In most editions of the [[FIFA World Cup]] finals tournament, the first round has been a group stage with groups of four teams, the top two qualifying for the "knockout stage" played as a [[single-elimination tournament]]. This format is common in many international team events, such as [[World cup competition|World Cup]]s or [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] tournaments. Some tournaments have two group stages, for example the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] or the [[1999–2000 UEFA Champions League]]. As well as a fixed number of qualifiers from each group, some may be determined by comparing between different groups: at the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] the best four of six third-place sides qualified; at the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]] the best one of five third-place sides did so.

Sometimes, results from an earlier phase are carried over into a later phase. In the [[Cricket World Cup]], the second stage, known as the Super Eight since [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007]] and before that the Super Six, features two teams from each of four preliminary groups (previously three teams from two preliminary groups), who do not replay the teams they have already played, but instead reuse the original results in the new league table. Formerly in the [[Swiss Football League]], teams played a double round-robin, at which point they were split into a top "championship" group and a bottom "relegation" group; each played a separate double round-robin, with results of all 32 matches counting for ranking each group. A similar system is also used by the [[Scottish Premiership]] and its historic predecessor, the [[Scottish Premier League]], since 2000. After 33 games, when every club has played every other club three times, the division is split into two halves. Clubs play a further 5 matches, against the teams in their half of the division. This can (and often does) result in the team placed 7th having a higher points total than the team placed 6th (because their final 5 games are considerably easier), nevertheless, a team in the bottom half never receives a higher final ranking than a team which qualified for the top half.

A multi-stage pool system was implemented by [[Curling Canada]] for the Canadian championship curling tournaments (the [[Scotties Tournament of Hearts]] for women and the [[Tim Hortons Brier]] for men) starting in 2018. The change was intended to allow the expansion of the main stage of the tournament from twelve to sixteen teams while keeping the round robin at eleven games. The teams are seeded using [[CTRS standings|a ranking system]] in which points are calculated based on the teams' results in all competitive [[bonspiel]]s using a complicated formula. Seeds 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13 and 16 and placed in Pool A while seeds 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14 and 15 are placed in Pool B. After each team has played seven games, the top four teams from each pool advance to the "Championship Pool." Carrying over their entire round robin records with them, Championship Pool teams play one game against each of the four teams in the opposite pool, with the top four teams qualifying for the [[page playoffs]]. In contrast, teams that fail to qualify for the Championship Pool play only one additional "Placement Round" game against the team that finished in the same position in the opposite pool for the purposes of determining final tournament ranking. For these teams, there is little else to play for since there is no form of relegation (and, with the expansion of the field to sixteen teams, no "Pre-Qualifying Tournament") and seeding is based solely on the performances of the participating teams and not the past results of the provinces and territories they represent.

The [[Premier A Slovenian Basketball League|top Slovenian basketball league]] has a unique system. In its first phase, 12 of the league's 13 clubs compete in a full home-and-away season, with the country's representative in the [[Euroleague]] (an elite pan-European club competition) exempt. The league then splits. The top seven teams are joined by the Euroleague representative for a second home-and-away season, with no results carrying over from the first phase. These eight teams compete for four spots in a final playoff. The bottom five teams play their own home-and-away league, but their previous results ''do'' carry over. These teams are competing to avoid relegation, with the bottom team automatically relegated and the second-from-bottom team forced to play a mini-league with the second- and third-place teams from the second level for a place in the top league.

==Promotion and relegation==
{{main|Promotion and relegation}}
Where the number of competitors is larger than a tournament format permits, there may be multiple tournaments held in parallel, with competitors assigned to a particular tournament based on their ranking. In [[chess]], [[Scrabble]], and many other individual games, many tournaments over one or more years contribute to a player's ranking. However, many team sports involve teams in only one major tournament per year. In European sport, including football, this constitutes the sole ranking for the following season; the top teams from each division of the league are promoted to a higher division, while the bottom teams from a higher division are relegated to a lower one.

This promotion and relegation occurs mainly in league tournaments, but also features in Davis Cup and Fed Cup tennis:
* In the Davis Cup:
** The first-round losers in the top-level World Group compete in playoff ties against the winners of the second-round ties in Group I of the competition's three regional zones, with the winners of each playoff tie remaining in or promoted to the World Group.
** In the three regional zones, Group II is conducted in a knockout format. The winner of the knockout tournament is promoted to Group I of its zone. The first-round losers then play relegation ties, with the losers relegated to Group III.
** Groups III and IV in each zone are contested in a round-robin format. The top two teams in each group are promoted, while the bottom two teams are relegated (assuming there is a lower group in their zone).
* In the Fed Cup:
** The four first-round losers in World Group I compete in playoff ties against the four winners in World Group II, with the winners remaining in or promoted to World Group I.
** The losers in World Group II play ties against the four zonal Group I winners (two from Europe/Africa and one each from Asia/Oceania and Americas), with the winners playing in World Group II the following season.
** Groups I and II in all zones, plus Group III in the Europe/Africa Zone only, are conducted in a round-robin format. The bottom two teams in each group are relegated to the next group down, assuming one exists, while the top two teams in Groups II and III are promoted to the next-higher group.

The hierarchy of divisions may be linear, or tree-like, as with the [[English football league system#Structure|English football league pyramid]].

==Bridge tournaments==
{{main|Duplicate bridge}}
In [[contract bridge]] a "tournament" is a tournament in the first sense above, composed of multiple "events", which are tournaments in the second sense. Some events may be single-elimination, double-elimination, or Swiss style. However, "[[Duplicate bridge#Pairs game|Pair events]]" are the most widespread. In these events, a number of deals (or ''[[board (bridge)|board]]s'') are each played several times by different players. For each such board the score achieved by each North-South (NS) pair is then measured against all the other NS pairs playing the same board. Thus pairs are rewarded for playing the same cards better than others have played them. There is a predetermined schedule of fixtures depending on the number of pairs and boards to be played, to ensure a good mix of opponents, and that no pair plays the same board or the same opponents twice (see [[duplicate bridge movements]]).

==Poker tournaments==
In [[poker tournament]]s, as players are eliminated, the number of tables is gradually reduced, with the remaining players redistributed among the remaining tables. Play continues until one player has won all of the chips in play. Finishing order is determined by the order in which players are eliminated: last player remaining gets 1st place, last player eliminated gets 2nd, previous player eliminated gets 3rd, etc.

In a "shootout" tournament, players do not change tables until every table has been reduced to one player.

==Alternatives to tournament systems==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=October 2015}}

While tournament structures attempt to provide an objective format for determining the best competitor in a game or sport, other methods exist.

;[[Challenge (competition)|Challenge]]{{anchor|Challenge}}: In this format, champions retain their title until they are defeated by an opponent, known as the ''challenger''. This system is used in [[Boxing#Professional boxing|professional boxing]] (see [[lineal championship]]), and the [[World Chess Championship]]. The right to become a contender may be awarded through a tournament, as in chess, or through a ranking system: the ranking systems used by boxing's governing bodies are controversial and opaque. If the champion retires or dies, then the current top challenger may be declared champion or the title may be vacant until a match between two challengers is held. Prior to 1920, the reigning Wimbledon champion received a bye to the final; the official name of the [[FA Cup|FA Challenge Cup]] reflects a similar arrangement which applied only in that tournament's very early years. The [[America's Cup]] is decided between the winners of separate champion and challenger tournaments, respectively for yachts from the country of the reigning champion, and of all other countries. The [[Ranfurly Shield]] in New Zealand rugby union is a challenge trophy between provincial teams, in which the holders of the Shield retain it until they are beaten by a challenging province.

;[[Ladder tournament]]: The ladder is an extension of the challenge system. All competitors are ranked on a "ladder". New contestants join the bottom of the ladder. Any contestant can challenge a competitor ranked slightly higher; if the challenger wins the match (or the challenge is refused) they swap places on the ladder. Ladders are common in internal club competitions in individual sports, like [[Squash (sport)|squash]] and [[Billiards|pool]]. Another ladder system is to give competitors a certain number of ranking points at the start. If two competitors play each other, then the winner will gain a percentage of the loser's ranking points. In this way competitors that join later will generally start in the middle, since top competitors already have won ranking points and bottom competitors have lost them.

;Selection: A champion may be selected by an authorised or self-appointed group, often after a [[voting|vote]]. While common in non-competitive activities, ranging from [[science fair]]s to [[Film|cinema]]'s [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], this is rarely significant in sports and games. Though unofficial, the polls run by the [[Associated Press]] and others were prestigious titles in [[College football|American college football]] prior to the creation in [[1998 NCAA Division I-A football season|1998]] of the [[Bowl Championship Series]], a quasi-official national championship (to this day, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] does not officially award [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|a championship]] in [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|the top division]] of college football). From [[2005 NCAA Division I-A football season|2005]] until the final season of the BCS in [[2013 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2013]], the [[AP Poll]] operated independently from the BCS, and two other polls were part of the BCS formula. The BCS was replaced by the [[College Football Playoff]], a four-team tournament whose participants are chosen by a selection committee, in [[2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2014]]; since then, all polls have operated independently from the CFP.

==Tournaments of value==

'''Unconscious cognition''' is the processing of perception, memory, learning, thought, and language without being aware of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://baars-gage.com/furtherreadinginstructors/Chapter08/Chapter8_Cognitive_Unconscious.pdf | title=Cognition, unconscious processes - section 7 | publisher=Elsevier | date=2007 | accessdate=2013-04-23 | author=John F. Kihlstrom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the [[unconscious mind]] on decision making is a topic greatly debated by [[neuroscientist]]s, [[linguist]]s and [[psychologist]]s around the world. Though the actual level of involvement of the unconscious brain during a [[cognitive]] process might still be a matter of differential opinion, the fact that the unconscious brain does play a role in cognitive activity is undeniable. Several experiments and well recorded phenomena attest to this fact, for example the [[illusory truth effect|illusion-of-truth effect]]. There have also been several experiments suggesting that the unconscious mind might actually be better at decision making than the conscious mind when there are multiple variables to take into consideration.

== History ==

The attitude of the scientific community towards the unconscious mind has undergone a drastic change from being viewed as a lazy reservoir of memories and non-task oriented behavior to being regarded as an active and essential component in the processes of decision making.

Historically, the unconscious mind has been viewed as the source of dreams, [[implicit memory]] (which allows people to walk or ride a bicycle without consciously thinking about the activity), and the storing place for memories. But new insight revealing that the unconscious brain might also be an active player in decision making, problem solving, creative writing and critical thinking have revolutionized the predominant view of the importance of the unconscious on cognitive processes. One familiar example of the operation of the unconscious in problem solving is a well-known phenomenon of having a "Eureka!" moment when a solution to a problem in the past presents itself without the involvement of active thinking.

Currently, several experiments are being performed to measure the extent of unconscious' influence on conscious thought.

== Types of unconscious ==

===Freud's unconscious===
[[Sigmund Freud]] is perhaps the most well-known psychologist and his theories laid the foundation for the serious scientific investigation of the unconscious brain. Consciousness, according to Freud, was the center for perception whereas the unconscious was the storehouse of memories, desires, and needs. According to Freud past thoughts and memories which are deleted from conscious thought are stored by the unconscious and these thoughts help direct the thoughts and feelings of an individual and influence their decision making processes. Freud believed that the Unconscious' influence on thoughts can be accessed by training one’s mind through meditation, or by random association, dream analysis and paying attention to [[Freudian slips]].

===Jung's unconscious===
[[Carl Jung]] further expounded Freud’s view of the unconscious and categorized the unconscious into the personal unconscious and the collective unconscious. He believed that the personal unconscious held memories and experiences specific to every individual and the collective unconscious held memories, predispositions and experiences of a species which are passed on from generation to generation and are shared among all the individuals of a species.

===Lacan's linguistic unconscious===

[[Jacques Lacan]] in his psychoanalytical theory compared the structuring of the unconscious to the way a language is structured. According to his theory there is no reference to self thus making the unconscious a dynamic structure. This suggests that unconscious influence on thought processes could be altered after [[traumatic brain injury]]. This theory could explain the cases of altered personality, like [[Phineas Gage]], due to trauma or traumatic brain injury.

== Measurement ==

To establish unconscious perception a demonstration of the absence of some critical stimulus is established and the effect of the same stimulus on behavior is tested. To establish the absence of the stimulus, the degree to which a critical stimulus reaches conscious awareness is assessed, by testing whether a subject can acknowledge or perceive the presence of the stimulus. This is called a direct measure (D) of processing, as the task requires some type of direct report on the perception of the critical stimulus from the subject. Also, one must assess the degree to which the stimulus affects a certain behavior. This process is the indirect measure (I) as responses of something other than the critical stimulus is measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schmidt T, Vorberg D |title=Criteria for unconscious cognition: three types of dissociation |journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=489–504 |date=April 2006  |pmid=16900839 |doi=10.3758/bf03193692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These measurements are associated to the dissociation logic, a foundational assumption that has dictated research into unconscious cognition for over a century now, according to which a cognitive phenomenon is strictly either conscious or unconscious. In fact, it has now the status of a [[scientific paradigm]], but criticism has started to fall upon it, with calls for a [[paradigm shift]] in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Augusto, L. M. (2018). Transitions versus dissociations: A paradigm shift in unconscious cognition. ''Axiomathes'', 28, 269-291. {{doi|10.1007/s10516-017-9366-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of the unconscious during data gathering ==

It has been well established that the unconscious plays a vital role in [[perception]] and data analysis. The numerous examples of [[optical illusions]], [[hallucinations]] and other tricks that the unconscious brain plays on the conscious brain provide ample evidence of the active role of the unconscious mind during data gathering and analysis. Several experiments have been performed to show that the unconscious brain is able to gather data at a much faster rate than the conscious brain and also that the unconscious brain filters out a great amount of information and can use this information to influence cognitive decision making processes.

===Artificially induced scotomas===
[[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran]] in his research proved that the unconscious brain not only  screens certain data from the conscious brain, rendering visual data inaccurate, but also is responsible for filling in false data in place of missing data in certain circumstances. In his paper on "Perceptual filling in of artificially induced [[scotomas]] in human vision"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ramachandran VS, Gregory RL |title=Perceptual filling in of artificially induced scotomas in human vision |journal=Nature |volume=350 |issue=6320 |pages=699–702 |date=April 1991  |pmid=2023631 |doi=10.1038/350699a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; he records the effect of the unconscious brain filling in the blind spots in the human visual field.

===Subliminal Messages===
[[Subliminal messages]] also utilize the phenomenon of the unconscious brain processing messages faster than the conscious brain and also noticing data in a visual or auditory field that remain below the threshold of the conscious brain.  come in various forms. They can be quick clips inserted within another video or barely perceptible text inscribed in a picture.
These messages flutter on the edge of perception and are almost impossible to notice unless and until one's conscious brain is called to pay attention to these minute details. Modern day ads, posters and even shows and movies which are broadcast around the world use subliminal messages to unconsciously attract an individual or manipulate an individual to unconscious like a product or a show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vokey JR, Read JD |title=Subliminal messages. Between the devil and the media |journal=The American Psychologist |volume=40 |issue=11 |pages=1231–9 |date=November 1985  |pmid=4083611 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.40.11.1231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect on learning, thinking and decision making ==

===Artificial grammar learning===
Studies that test the way in which humans acquire language skills and learn how to apply the rules of [[grammar]] show that a large amount of language and grammar learning takes place unconsciously. Experiments were performed in which participants were asked to identify whether certain  nonsensical and made up words belong to a group of words which they had been previously shown. Some participants were not informed that the word sets were based on  rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Scott RB, Dienes Z |title=The conscious, the unconscious, and familiarity |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=1264–88 |date=September 2008  |pmid=18763904 |doi=10.1037/a0012943}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of their responses showed that the participants were more likely to associate words which were not shown previously as a part of the group if they followed the preset grammatical rules. This shows that it might not be necessary to be consciously aware of grammatical rules to know proper grammar. This theory might explain the feeling we undergo when we feel that a certain sentence structure is awkward or wrong even though we might not be able to clearly define the reason why the sentence is incorrect.

===Implicit egotism===
Implicit egotism refers to the unconscious tendency of people to prefer things that resemble the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Brett W. |last1=Pelham |first2=Mauricio |last2=Carvallo |first3=John T. |last3=Jones |date=April 2005 |title=Current Directions in Psychological Science |journal=Implicit Egotism |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=106–10 |jstor=20182998 |doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00344.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In studies performed to test the effect of implicit egotism it has been shown that implicit egotism does in fact play a significant role in processes that influence major life decisions. Studies show that inexplicably people choose partners whose name is phonetically or structurally similar to their own names. This effect of implicit egotism is not only limited to relationship decisions but can also be seen in decisions regarding place or city of residence and arguable in almost every other aspect of life.

===Unconscious association===
The unconscious mind's tendency to make associations can have a significant effect on decision making processes. For example, we generally associate a green traffic light as a sign to keep proceeding while we associate a red traffic light as a sign to come to a halt. If in an experimental setting a person attuned to these associations was asked to come to a halt when shown a green light and keep moving when shown a red light, the individual would have to make a conscious effort to follow these new set of rules.The associations of the unconscious mind lead to the creation of implicit attitudes. An [[implicit attitude]] manifests itself as an action or judgment that is under the control of automatically activated evaluation, without the performer's awareness of that causation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenwald AG, Banaji MR |title=Implicit social cognition: attitudes, self-esteem, and stereotypes |journal=Psychological Review |volume=102 |issue=1 |pages=4–27 |date=January 1995  |pmid=7878162 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/rev/102/1/4 |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.102.1.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implicit attitudes can have a profound effect on decision making when automatic implicit associations are made in socially significant ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenwald AG, McGhee DE, Schwartz JL |title=Measuring individual differences in implicit cognition: the implicit association test |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=74 |issue=6 |pages=1464–80 |date=June 1998  |pmid=9654756 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/74/6/1464 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.6.1464}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on unconscious racial prejudice, sexist attitudes and [[nepotism]] might have a huge bearing in the real world as one might unconsciously show favoritism due to implicit attitudes.

== Unconscious thought theory ==
{{Main|Unconscious thought theory}}
Experiments were performed to measure the decision making prowess of the unconscious mind and they showed that when there are multiple variables to be considered in a given decision making situation, the unconscious mind can actually be a better decision maker than the conscious mind.&lt;ref&gt;González-Vallejo, C., Lassiter, G. D., Bellezza, F. S., &amp; Lindberg, M. J. (2008). "Save angels perhaps": A critical examination of  and the deliberation-without-attention effect. Review of General Psychology, 12(3), 282-296. {{doi|10.1037/a0013134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ap Dijksterhuis]] in his experiments to measure the effectiveness of the unconscious brain in its decision making abilities performed 3 experiments that involved choosing or evaluating different alternatives based on positive and negative attributes. Participants were divided in 3 groups and different groups were allowed come to a conclusion about the alternatives in different ways. The first group was asked to come up with instantaneous evaluations, the second group was asked to come up with an evaluation after careful consideration (consciously) and the third group was asked to come with an evaluation after a period of time in which they were distracted by another task, which occupied their consciousness, unconsciously. It was proven in all three experiments that the group which was allowed to think about the different alternatives unconsciously stumbled upon the right evaluations and picked the alternatives with the most positive attributes more often than the other 2 groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dijksterhuis A |title=Think different: the merits of unconscious thought in preference development and decision making |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=87 |issue=5 |pages=586–98 |date=November 2004  |pmid=15535773 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.87.5.586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The "radical plasticity" thesis ==

[[Axel Cleeremans]], a professor of cognitive science with the Department of Psychology of the Université Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, in his paper "The radical plasticity thesis: how the brain learns to be conscious", proposed the idea that conscious brain is a product of  unconscious brain's attempts at predicting the consequences of its actions on the external world. The paper also states that the activity of one cerebral region and its effect on the other regions of the brain. According to "radical plasticity" thesis, thinking and reasoning are the products of the unconscious mind's ability to decipher and process countless possibilities and predict the consequences of taking a certain course of action. In contrast, the conscious mind is only able to process the outcomes of no more than a couple of courses of action during decision making.&lt;ref name=pmid21687455&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cleeremans A |title=The Radical Plasticity Thesis: How the Brain Learns to be Conscious |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=2 |issue= |pages=86 |year=2011 |pmid=21687455 |pmc=3110382 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brain unconsciously learns to re-describe its own activity to itself in terms of possibilities and probabilities and generates a method to allow activate certain parts of its anatomy to help engender the most profitable outcome. These learned re-descriptions, enriched by the emotional value associated with them, form the basis of conscious experience.&lt;ref name=pmid21687455/&gt;

'''Self and Identity''' is a subfield of [[psychology]]. As the name implies, it deals with topics pertaining to both [[self (psychology)|self]] and [[identity (social science)|identity]]. Key areas of investigation include [[self-concept]], [[self-esteem]], and [[self-control]].

What distinguishes self and identity as a discipline is its [[science|scientific]] character. Emphasis is placed on the empirical testing of systematic theories about relevant phenomena. Hence, its methodological approach differs from both [[philosophy]] and [[sociology]].
 
Self and Identity incorporates elements from different areas of psychology. However, it owes particularly large debt to [[personality psychology]] and [[social psychology]].

==Individual level analysis of the self==
There are levels of analysis that one can look at self and identity. One level of analysis is the self on the individual level, for example, self-states, self-motives, [[self-esteem]], [[self-efficacy]], etc. Self-states are self-process that include unbiased self-awareness. However, self-motives are more serious impulses to action, something that is innate and Societal or cultural analysis of the self.
The other level of analysis is on the societal or cultural level, for example, the cultural conception of a person, cultural arrangements that make the person who they are and the cultural concept of self. &lt;ref&gt;Ashmore, R. D., &amp; Jussim, L. (Eds.). (1997). Self and Identity: Fundamental Issues. Cary, NC, USA: Oxford University Press. Retrieved from http://www.ebrary.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Self and identity are highly contingent upon culture. In industrialized Western cultures, the concept of self is based solely on independence.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, D. G. (2015). Exploring Social Psychology, 7th Edition. New York: McGraw Hill Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Waste hierarchy rect-en.svg|right|thumbnail|300px|Waste hierarchy. Refusing, reducing, reusing, recycling and composting allow to reduce waste.]]

'''Waste minimisation''' is a set of processes and practices intended to reduce the amount of [[waste]] produced.  By reducing or eliminating the generation of harmful and persistent wastes, waste minimisation supports efforts to promote a more [[sustainable]] society.&lt;ref name=USEPA&gt;{{cite web|author=United States Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/ref&gt;  Waste minimisation involves redesigning products and processes and/or changing societal patterns of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] and production.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{cite web|author=Davidson, G.|date=2011|title=Waste Management Practices: Literature Review.|publisher=Retrieved from https://www.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/sustainability/Waste%20Management%20Literature%20Review%20Final%20June%202011%20(1.49%20MB).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most environmentally resourceful, [[economic efficiency|economically efficient]], and [[cost effective]] way to manage waste often is to not have to address the problem in the first place. Managers see waste minimisation as a primary focus for most [[waste management]] strategies. Proper waste treatment and disposal can require a significant amount of time and resources; therefore, the benefits of waste minimisation can be considerable if carried out in an effective, safe and sustainable manner.

Traditional waste management focuses on processing waste after it is created, concentrating on [[re-use]], [[recycling]],  and [[waste-to-energy]] conversion.&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt; Waste minimisation involves efforts to avoid creating the waste during manufacturing.  To effectively implement waste minimisation the manager requires knowledge of the production process, [[life cycle assessment#Cradle-to-grave|cradle-to-grave analysis]] (the tracking of materials from their extraction to their return to earth) and details of the composition of the waste.

The main sources of waste [[Waste by country|vary from country to country]]. In the [[UK]], most waste comes from the construction and [[demolition]] of buildings, followed by [[mining]] and quarrying, industry and commerce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm70/7009/7009.pdf ROYAL COMMISSION ON ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION: Urban Environment] 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Household waste constitutes a relatively small proportion of all waste.  Industrial waste is often tied to requirements in the [[supply chain]].  For example, a company handling a product may insist that it should be shipped using particular packing because it fits downstream needs.

==Benefits==
Waste minimisation can [[environment protection|protect the environment]] and often turns out to have positive economic benefits.  Waste minimisation can improve:&lt;ref name=USEPA/&gt;
*Efficient production practices.  Waste minimisation can achieve more output of product per unit of input of [[raw material]]s.
*Economic returns.  More efficient use of products means reduced costs of purchasing new materials improving the financial performance of a company.
*[[Reputation|Public image]].  The environmental profile of a company is an important part of its overall reputation and waste minimisation reflects a proactive movement towards [[environmental protection]].
*Quality of products produced.  New innovation and technological practices can reduce waste generation and improve the quality of the inputs in the production phase.
*[[Environmental responsibility]].  Minimising or eliminating waste generation makes it easier to meet targets of environmental regulations, policies, and standards. The environmental impact of waste will be reduced.

==Industries==
In industry, using more efficient manufacturing processes and better materials generally reduces the production of waste. The application of waste minimisation techniques has led to the development of innovative and commercially successful replacement products.

Waste minimisation efforts often require investment, which is usually compensated by the savings. However, waste reduction in one part of the production process may create waste production in another part.

There are government incentives for waste minimisation, which focus on the environmental benefits of adopting waste minimisation strategies. In the [[UK]], several pilot schemes such as The Catalyst Project and the Dee Waste Minimisation Project, have shown the efficacy of such policies. Fourteen companies in [[Merseyside]] took part in the Catalyst Project; the project generated overall savings of £9 million and landfill waste was reduced by 12,000 tonnes per year. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Processes==

: 
* [[Reuse]] of scrap material
: Scraps can be immediately re-incorporated at the beginning of the manufacturing line so that they do not become a waste product. Many industries routinely do this; for example, [[paper mill]]s return any damaged rolls to the beginning of the production line, and in the manufacture of plastic items, off-cuts and scrap are re-incorporated into new products.
* Improved [[quality control]] and [[process monitoring]]
: Steps can be taken to ensure that the number of reject batches is kept to a minimum.  This is achieved by increasing the frequency of inspection and the number of points of inspection. For example, installing automated continuous monitoring equipment can help to identify production problems at an early stage.
* Waste exchanges
: This is where the waste product of one process becomes the raw material for a second process. Waste exchanges represent another way of reducing waste disposal volumes for waste that cannot be eliminated.
* Ship to [[point of use]]
: This involves making deliveries of incoming [[raw material]]s or components direct to the point where they are assembled or used in the manufacturing process to minimise handling and the use of [[protective wrapping]]s or enclosures.
* [[Zero waste]]
: This is a whole systems approach that aims to eliminate waste at the source and at all points down the supply chain, with the intention of producing no waste. It is a design philosophy which emphasizes waste prevention as opposed to end of pipe waste management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dickinson, J.|author2=Snow, W.K.|date=2001|last-author-amp=yes|title=The end of waste: Zero Waste by 2020.|url=http://www.zerowaste.co.nz/assets/Reports/TheEndofWaste.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Product design===

Waste minimisation and resource maximisation for [[Manufacturing|manufactured products]] can most easily be done at the design stage. Reducing the number of [[wikt:component|component]]s used in a product or making the product easier to take apart can make it easier to be repaired or recycled at the end of its useful life.

In some cases, it may be best not to minimise the volume of [[raw material]]s used to make a product, but instead reduce the volume or [[toxicity]] of the waste created at the end of a product's life, or the environmental impact of the product's use.  (See section [[Waste minimisation#Durability|Durability]]).

====Fitting the intended use====
In this strategy, products and packages are optimally designed to meet their intended use.  This applies especially to packaging materials, which should only be as durable as necessary to serve their intended purpose. On the other hand, it could be more wasteful if food, which has consumed resources and energy in its production, is damaged and spoiled because of extreme measures to reduce the use of [[paper]], [[metal]]s, [[glass]] and [[plastic]]s in its packaging.

====Durability====
Improving [[durable goods|product durability]], such as extending a [[vacuum cleaner]]'s useful life to 15 years instead of 12, can reduce waste and usually much improves resource optimisation.

But in some cases it has a negative [[environmental impact]].  If a product is too durable, its replacement with more efficient technology is likely to be delayed.  For example, a washing machine produced 10 years ago may use twice as much water, detergent and energy as one produced today. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  Therefore, extending an older machine's useful life may place a heavier burden on the environment than scrapping it, recycling its metal and buying a new model.  Similarly, older vehicles consume more fuel and produce more emissions than their modern counterparts.

Most proponents of waste minimisation consider that the way forward may be to view any manufactured product at the end of its useful life as a resource for recycling and reuse rather than waste.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}  Recycling a product is easier if it is constructed of fewer materials.  Car manufacturers have recently reduced the number of plastics used in their cars from twenty or more to three or four, {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} hence simplifying the recovery of plastics from scrapped cars. However, exceptions (like having a combination of paper and plastic or plastic coating on glass) do exist, and might enable a product to fulfill its role with the minimum of resources.

Making refillable glass [[bottle]]s strong enough to withstand several journeys between the [[consumer]] and the [[bottling plant]] requires making them thicker and so heavier, which increases the resources required to transport them. Since transport has a large environmental impact, careful evaluation is required of the number of return journeys bottles make.  If a refillable bottle is thrown away after being refilled only several times, the resources wasted may be greater than if the bottle had been designed for a single journey..

Many choices involve trade-offs of environmental impact, and often there is insufficient information to make informed decisions.

==Retail==
Various aspects of business practices affect waste, such as the use of [[disposable tableware]] in restaurants.
===Reusable shopping bags===
Reusable bags are a visible form of re-use, and some stores offer a "bag credit" for re-usable shopping bags, although at least [[Kroger|one chain]] reversed its policy, claiming "it was just a temporary bonus".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wcpo.com/money/consumer/dont-waste-your-money/kroger-ends-reusable-bag-discount Kroger ends reusable bag discount], WCPO TV, Cincinnati&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, one study suggests that a bag tax is a more effective incentive than a similar discount.&lt;ref name="brookingsbag"&gt;[https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/why-a-bag-tax-works-better-than-a-reusable-bag-bonus/ Why a Bag Tax Works Better Than a Reusable Bag Bonus], Brookings Inst., 8-Jan-2014&lt;/ref&gt;.  (Of note, the before/after study compared a circumstance in which some stores offered a discount vs. a circumstance in which all stores applying the tax.)  While there is a minor inconvenience involved, this may remedy itself, as reusable bags are generally more convenient for carrying groceries.

==Households==
This section details some waste minimisation techniques for [[household]]ers.

Appropriate amounts and sizes can be chosen when purchasing goods; buying large containers of paint for a small decorating job or buying larger amounts of food than can be consumed create unnecessary waste. Also, if a pack or [[can (disambiguation)#Container|can]] is to be thrown away, any remaining contents must be removed before the container can be recycled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recycling-guide.org.uk/etiquette.html Removing food remains to reduce waste]&lt;/ref&gt;

Home [[composting]], the practice of turning kitchen and garden waste into compost can be considered waste minimisation.

The resources that households use can be reduced considerably by [[electricity consumption|using electricity]] thoughtfully (e.g. turning off lights and equipment when it is not needed) and by reducing the number of car journeys made. Individuals can reduce the amount of waste they create by buying fewer products and by buying products which last longer. Mending broken or worn items of clothing or equipment also contributes to minimising household waste. Individuals can minimise their water usage, and walk or cycle to their destination rather than using their car to save fuel and cut down emissions.

In a domestic situation, the potential for minimisation is often dictated by [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].  Some people may view it as wasteful to purchase new products solely to follow [[fashion trend]]s when the older products are still usable.  Adults working full-time have little free time, and so may have to purchase more [[convenience food|convenient foods]] that require little preparation, or prefer disposable nappies if there is a baby in the family.

The amount of waste an individual produces is a small portion of all waste produced by society, and personal waste reduction can only make a small impact on overall waste volumes.  Yet, influence on policy can be exerted in other areas. Increased consumer awareness of the impact and power of certain purchasing decisions allows industry and individuals to change the total [[resource consumption]].  Consumers can influence manufacturers and distributors by avoiding buying products that do not have [[eco-labelling]], which is currently not mandatory, or choosing products that minimise the use of packaging. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Pullapart|PullApart]] combines both [[Natural environment|environmental]] and [[consumer]] packaging [[Statistical survey|surveys]], in a [[Curbside collection|curbside]] packaging [[recycling]] classification system to minimise waste. Where reuse schemes are available, consumers can be proactive and use them.

==Health-care facilities==

Health-care establishments are massive producers of waste.&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|date=2011|title=Waste from Health Care facilities Fact Sheet No 253|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs253/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major sources of health-care waste are:  hospitals, laboratories and research centres, mortuary and autopsy centres, animal research and testing laboratories, blood banks and collection services, and nursing homes for the elderly.&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt;

Waste minimisation can offer many opportunities to these establishments to use fewer resources, be less wasteful and generate less hazardous waste.  Good management and control practices among health-care facilities can have a significant effect on the reduction of waste generated each day.

===Practices===

There are many examples of more efficient practices that can encourage waste minimization in healthcare establishments and research facilities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|date=2014|title=Waste minimization, recycling and reuse.|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/medicalwaste/058to060.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Source reduction'''
*Purchasing reductions which ensures the selection of supplies that are less wasteful or less hazardous.
*The use of physical rather than chemical cleaning methods such as steam disinfection instead of chemical disinfection.
*Preventing the unnecessary wastage of products in nursing and cleaning activities.

'''Management and control measures at hospital level'''
*Centralized purchasing of hazardous chemicals.
*Monitoring the flow of chemicals within the health care facility from receipt as a raw material to disposal as a hazardous waste.
*The careful separation of waste matter to help minimize the quantities of hazardous waste and disposal.

'''Stock management of chemical and pharmaceutical products'''
*Frequent ordering of relatively small quantities rather than large quantities at one time.
*Using the oldest batch of a product first to avoid expiration dates and unnecessary waste.
*Using all the contents of a container containing hazardous waste.
*Checking the expiry date of all products at the time of delivery.

The summit was created in response to the United Nations' inclusion of countries that commit particularly atrocious human rights abuses, especially in the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council]], such as [[China]], [[Syria]], [[Sudan]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[North Korea]], and [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="We Have a Dream" Global Summit against Discrimination and Persecution|url=http://uhrp.org/featured-articles/we-have-dream-global-summit-against-discrimination-and-persecution|work=Uyghur Human Rights Project|accessdate=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=25 rights groups to hold victim summit in parallel to Durban III|url=http://blog.unwatch.org/index.php/2011/06/13/25-rights-groups-to-hold-victim-summit-in-parallel-to-durban-iii/|work=UN Watch|accessdate=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim has been supported by the [[Human Rights Foundation]], a partner of the summit, whose President, [[Thor Halvorssen (human rights activist)|Thor Halvorssen]], refers to Durban III as “the last act in a tragicomedy” that underscores the UN’s complacency with “despotic regimes which speak pretty words about human rights while they kill, torture, or jail their opponents”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HRF’s Response to Durban III: Partnership with "We Have A Dream" Global Summit|url=http://www.humanrightsfoundation.org/media/HRFResponsetoDurbanIII09212011.html|work=The Human Rights Foundation|accessdate=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
