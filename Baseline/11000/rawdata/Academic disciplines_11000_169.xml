'''Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles''' (also called '''AP CSP''') is an [[AP Computer Science]] course and examination offered by the [[College Board]] to [[high school]] students as an opportunity to earn college credit for a [[college]]-level [[computer science]] course. '''AP Computer Science Principles'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-principles AP Computer Science Principles Home Page], The College Board&lt;/ref&gt; is meant to be the equivalent of a first-semester course in computer science. Assessment for AP Computer Science Principles is divided into two parts, both an end of course exam as well as the creation of artifacts throughout the course.&lt;ref name="apstudent.collegeboard.org"&gt;[https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-principles/about-the-exam AP Computer Science Principles About The Exam Page], The College Board&lt;/ref&gt;

The AP Computer Science Principles Exam was administered for the first time on May 5, 2017.

==Topic Outline==
'''Curriculum Overview'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-curriculum-framework.pdf |title=AP Computer Science Principles: Curriculum Framework 2016-2017 |format=PDF |pages=2–3 |publisher=College Board |date=Fall 2010 |accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The framework focuses on computational thinking practices which are applied throughout the curriculum. The concept outline included in the curriculum is divided into seven units called "Big Ideas". Each unit contains a series of "Learning Objectives". Each "Learning Objective" is a general benchmark of student performance or understanding which has an associated "Enduring Understanding". An "Enduring Understanding" is a core comprehension which students should retain well after completing the course. Each "Learning Objective" is split into multiple "Essential Knowledge" standards, which are specific facts or content which the student must know to demonstrate mastery of the  learning objective when assessed.

'''Abbreviations''' in music are of two kinds, namely, [[Glossary_of_musical_terminology|abbreviations of terms]] related to [[musical expression]], and the true musical abbreviations by the help of which certain passages, chords, etc., may be notated in a shortened form, to the greater convenience of both composer and performer. Abbreviations of the first kind are like most [[abbreviation]]s in language; they consist for the most part of the initial letter or first syllable of the word employed—as for instance, {{serif|'''''p'''''}} or {{serif|'''''f'''''}} for the [[dynamics (music)|dynamic markings]] piano and forte, ''cresc.'' for [[crescendo]], ''Ob.'' for [[oboe]], ''Fag.'' for [[bassoon]] ({{lang-it|fagotto}}). This article is about abbreviations used in [[music notation]]. For abbreviations of terms related to musical expression and music in general, see [[Glossary of musical terminology]].

==Repetition of a single note or chord==
The continued repetition of a note or chord is expressed by a stroke or strokes across the [[stem (music)|stem]], or above or below the note if it be a [[whole note]] or [[double whole note]]. The number of strokes denotes the subdivision of the written note into [[eighth note]]s, [[sixteenth note]]s, etc., unless the word [[tremolo]] or tremolando is added, in which case the repetition is as rapid as possible, without regard to the exact number of notes played. (When strokes are added to notes shorter than a quarter note, each beam counts as a stroke.) In the first bar of the example below, the half note with the single stroke across the stem in the ''written'' staff becomes 4 eighth notes in the ''played'' staff. Through the use of 2 strokes across the stem in the second bar, the next full note is expressed as a phrase of 16 sixteenth notes.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c'' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \new staff { c2:8^\markup { Written: } &lt;e c g&gt;: | c1:16 | \time 2/4 f,2:32 | \time 4/4 f4:8 a:8 c:16 f:16 | b,8:16 d:16 b:16 g:16 a:32 b:32 c:32 d:32 \bar "|." } \new staff { c8^\markup { Played: } c c c &lt;e c g&gt; &lt;e c g&gt; &lt;e c g&gt; &lt;e c g&gt; | c16 c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c | f,32 f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f | f8 f a a c16 c c c f f f f | b, b d d b b g g a32 a a a b b b b c c c c d d d d } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

On [[bowed instruments]] the rapid reiteration of a single note is easy, but in [[piano]] music an octave or chord becomes necessary to produce a tremolo, the manner of writing and performing of which is seen below.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c'' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 2/4 \new staff { &lt;g g'&gt;4:16 ^\markup { \italic tremolo } &lt;e' c g&gt;:16 | \repeat tremolo 4 { &lt;c e&gt;16^\markup { \italic tremolo } g } | s4 } \new staff { g'32*8/12 g, g' g, g' g, g' g, g' g, g' g, &lt;c e&gt;32*8/12 g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g | &lt;c e&gt;32 g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g | s4 } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

In the abbreviation expressed by strokes, as above, the passage to be abbreviated can contain no note of greater length than an eighth note, but it is possible also to divide a long note into quarter notes, by means of dots (sometimes known as ''divisi'' dots) placed over it, as below.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c'' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 4/4 \new staff { c2^\markup { .. } c2^\markup { .. } | c1^\markup { .... } | s2 } \new staff { c4 c c c | c c c c | s2 } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

This is however seldom done, as only a small amount of space is saved. When a long note has to be repeated in the form of [[tuplet|triplets or sextuplets]], the figure 3 or 6 is usually placed over it in addition to the stroke across the stem, and the note is sometimes, though not necessarily, written dotted.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c'' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 4/4 \new staff { c4:8^\markup { \smaller { \italic 3 } } c4:8^\markup { \smaller { \italic 3 } } c2:8^\markup { \smaller { \italic 6 } } \bar "||" \time 4/4 \omit TupletNumber \tuplet 3/2 { c4.:8^\markup { \smaller { \italic 3 } } } \tuplet 3/2 { c4.:8^\markup { \smaller { \italic 3 } } } \tuplet 6/4 { c4.:16^\markup { \smaller { \italic 6 } } } \tuplet 6/4 { c4.:16^\markup { \smaller { \italic 6 } } } \bar "||" } \new staff { \tuplet 3/2 4 {c8 c c c c c c c c c c c} | \tuplet 3/2 4 {c8 c c c c c} \tuplet 6/4 4 {c16 c c c c c c c c c c c} } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

==Alternation of two notes==

The repetition of a group of two notes is abbreviated by two notes (most often [[half note]]s or [[whole note]]s) connected by the number of strokes ordinarily used to express eighth notes, sixteenth notes, etc., according to the rate of movement intended, as below. It will be observed that a passage lasting for the value of one half note requires two half notes to express it, on account of the group consisting of two notes.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 4/4 \new staff { \repeat tremolo 2 { f8 a } \repeat tremolo 4 { f16 a} | \repeat tremolo 4 { f8 a } | s4 } \new staff { f8 a f a f16 a f a f a f a | f8 a f a f a f a | s4 } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

As seen above, half notes are often written with the strokes beaming the notes together (which is unambiguous as white notes with beams are not otherwise used in music), but with quarter notes and shorter the strokes must be separated from the stems to prevent them being misread as a shorter note value.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c'' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 2/4 \new staff { \repeat tremolo 4 { c32 a } \repeat tremolo 4 { g64 c } \repeat tremolo 4 { g64 b } | s4 } \new staff { c32 a c a c a c a g64 [c g c g c g c] g [b g b g b g b] | s4 } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

==Patterns of groups of three or more notes==

A group of three, four, or more notes is abbreviated by the repetition of the cross strokes without the notes as many times as the group has to be repeated.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 4/4 \new staff { \repeat percent 2 { e8[ g c g] } | \repeat percent 4 { e16 g c g } \bar "||" } \new staff { e8 g c g e g c g | e16 g c g e g c g e g c g e g c g } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

This can also be written with the notes forming the group are written as a chord, with the necessary number of strokes across the stem. In this case the word ''simili'' or ''segue'' is added, to show that the order of notes in the first group (which must be written out in full) is to be repeated, and to prevent the possibility of mistaking the effect intended for the repetition of the chord as a whole.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 4/4 \new staff { d16 f a f &lt;d f a&gt;2.:16^\markup { \italic simili } | s4 } \new staff { d16 f a f d f a f d f a f d f a f | s4 } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

==Repetition marks==

Another sign of abbreviation of a group consists of an oblique line with two dots, one on each side; this serves to indicate the repetition of a group of any number of notes of any length. This can even apply to a passage composed of several groups, provided such passage is not more than two bars in length.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 4/4 \new staff { \repeat percent 2 { e16 g f e f g a b c g a b c d e f g a g f e d c b a g c b a g a f } \bar "||" } \new staff { e16 g f e f g a b c g a b c d e f g a g f e d c b a g c b a g a f | e g f e f g a b c g a b c d e f g a g f e d c b a g c b a g a f } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

A more usual method of abbreviating the repetition of a passage of the length of the above is to write over it the word ''bis'' (twice), or in some cases ''ter'' (three times), or to enclose it between the dots of an ordinary [[repeat sign]].

==Passages in octaves==
{{main|Octave}}
Passages intended to be played in octaves are often written as single notes with the words ''coll' ottava'' or ''coll' 8va'' placed above or below them, according as the upper or lower octave is to be added.

:&lt;score&gt;
&lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 2/4 \new Staff { c''8^\markup { \smaller { \italic "coll' 8" \super \italic "va" } } d'' e'' f'' \bar "||" \clef bass g_\markup { \smaller { \italic "coll' 8" \super \italic "va" } } e c4 \bar "||" s4 } \new Staff { &lt;c'' c'''&gt;8 &lt;d'' d'''&gt; &lt;e'' e'''&gt; &lt;f'' f'''&gt; | \clef bass &lt;g g,&gt; &lt;e e,&gt; &lt;c c,&gt;4 | s4 } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

The word ''8&lt;sup&gt;va&lt;/sup&gt;'' (or sometimes ''8&lt;sup&gt;va&lt;/sup&gt; alta'' or ''8&lt;sup&gt;va&lt;/sup&gt; bassa'') written above or below a passage does not add octaves, but merely transposes the passage an octave higher or lower. In [[clarinet]] music the word ''[[chalumeau]]'' is used to signify that the passage is to be played an octave lower than written.

:&lt;score&gt;
&lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 4/4 \new Staff { \ottava #1 f'''8 e''' d''' c''' \ottava #0 b''^\markup { \smaller \italic loco } a'' g''4 \bar "||" \clef bass \ottava #-1 a,,8 b,, c, d, \ottava #0 e_\markup { \smaller \italic loco } f g4 \bar "||" \clef treble \ottava #-1 \set Staff.ottavation = #"chalumeau" e8 g c' g f a c' a | g \ottava #0 e'_\markup { \smaller \italic clar. } g' c'' e''2 \bar "||" } \new Staff { f'''8 e''' d''' c''' b'' a'' g''4 | \clef bass a,,8 b,, c, d, e, f, g,4 | \clef treble e8 g c' g f a c' a | g e' g' c'' e''2 } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

All these alterations (which can scarcely be considered abbreviations except that they spare the use of [[ledger line]]s) are counteracted, and the passage restored to its usual position, by the ending of the enclosing bracket, the word ''loco'', or in clarinet music ''clarinette''.

==Abbreviations in scores==

In [[orchestra]]l music it often happens that certain of the instruments play in [[unison]]; when this is the case the parts are sometimes not all written in the score, but the lines belonging to one or more of the instruments are left blank, and the words ''coi violini'' or ''col basso'', etc., are added, to indicate that the instruments in question have to play in unison with the violins or basses, as the case may be, or when two instruments of the same kind, such as first and second violins, have to play in unison, the word ''unisono'' or ''col primo'' is placed instead of the notes in the line belonging to the second. Where two parts are written on one staff in a score the sign ''[[a due|a 2]]'' denotes that both play the same notes; and ''a 1'' that the second of the two is resting. The indication ''a 3'' or ''a 4'' at the head of [[fugue]]s indicates the number of parts or voices in which the fugue is written.

An abbreviation which is often very troublesome to the conductor occurs in [[manuscript]] scores, when a considerable part of the composition is repeated without alteration, and the corresponding number of bars are left vacant, with the remark ''come sopra'' (as above). This is not met with in printed scores.

==Chord abbreviations used in music theory==
[[Image:Scale degree numbers.png|thumb|350px|Root position triads of the C major scale indicated using [[Roman numeral analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Oswald Jonas|Jonas, Oswald]] (1982). ''Introduction to the Theory of Heinrich Schenker'' (1934: ''Das Wesen des musikalischen Kunstwerks: Eine Einführung in Die Lehre Heinrich Schenkers''), p.22. Trans. John Rothgeb. {{ISBN|0-582-28227-6}}. Shown all uppercase.&lt;/ref&gt; {{audio|Root position triads from C major scale.mid|Play}}]]

There are also abbreviations relating to [[music analysis]], some of which are of great value. In [[figured bass]], for instance, the various chords are expressed by figures, and the several authors in the nineteenth century invented or availed themselves of various methods of shortly expressing the different chords and intervals, particularly using [[Roman numeral analysis]].

[[Gottfried Weber]] represents an interval by a number with one or two dots before it to express [[minor chord|minor]] or [[Diminished triad|diminished]], and one or two after it for [[major chord|major]] or [[augmented chord|augmented]].

[[Johann Anton André]] makes use of a [[right triangle]] to express a [[triad (music)|triad]], and a [[square]], for a [[seventh chord]], the inversions being indicated by one, two, or three small vertical lines across their base, and the classification into major, minor, diminished, or augmented by the numbers 1, 2, 3, or 4, placed in the centre.

Al-Qalaṣādī is known for being one of the most influential voices in [[Mathematical notation|algebraic notation]] since antiquity and for taking "the first steps toward the introduction of [[algebra]]ic symbolism&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;. He wrote numerous books on [[arithmetic]] and algebra, including ''al-Tabsira fi'lm al-hisab'' ({{lang-ar|التبصير في علم الحساب}} "''Clarification of the science of arithmetic''").&lt;ref name=MacTutor&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Al-Qalasadi|title= Abu'l Hasan ibn Ali al Qalasadi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Al-Qalaṣādī was born in [[Baza, Granada|Baza]], an outpost of the [[Emirate of Granada]]. He received education in [[Granada]], but continued to support his family in Baza. He published many works and eventually retired to his native Baza. He spent seven years living in [[Tlemcen]], where he studied under the local [[Berbers|Berber]] scholars, the most important of which was a man named Ibn Zaghu. 

[[File:Granada by Piri Reis.jpg|350px|thumb|right|Map of the coasts of the kingdom of Granada by [[Piri Reis]] (16th century).]]

His works dealt with Algebra and contained the precise mathematical answers to problems in everyday life, such as the composition of medicaments, the calculation of the drop of irrigation canals and the explanation of frauds linked to instruments of measurement. The second part belongs to the already ancient tradition of judicial and cultural mathematics and joins a collection of little arithmetical problems presented in the form of poetical riddles

In 1480 the [[Christian]] forces of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]], "The Catholic Monarchs", raided and often pillaged the city, al-Qalasādī himself served in the mountain citadels which were erected in the vicinity of Baza. al-Qalasādī eventually left his homeland and took refuge with his family in [[Béja]], [[Tunisia]], where he died in 1486. Baza was eventually besieged by the forces of Ferdinand and Isabella and its inhabitants sacked.

==Symbolic algebra==
Like his predecessors al-Qalaṣādī made attempts at creating an [[Mathematical notation|algebraic notation]]. However, these symbols were not the invention of al-Qalaṣādī. The same ones had been used by other mathematicians in North Africa 100 years earlier.&lt;ref name=MacTutor/&gt; Al-Qalaṣādī represented [[Table of mathematical symbols|mathematical symbols]] using characters from the [[Arabic alphabet]], where:&lt;ref name=MacTutor/&gt;

*ﻭ (''[[Waw (letter)|wa]]'') means "and" for [[addition]] (+)
*ﻻ (''[[Illa (Arabic)|illa]]'') means "less" for [[subtraction]] (-)
*ف (''[[Fāʾ|fi]]'') means "times" for [[multiplication]] (*)
*ة (''ala'') means "over" for [[Division (mathematics)|division]] (/)
*ﺝ (''[[Ǧīm|j]]'') represents ''jadah'' meaning "[[Root of a function|root]]"
*ﺵ (''[[Shin (letter)|sh]]'') represents ''shay'' meaning "thing" for a [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] (x)
*ﻡ (''[[Mīm|m]]'') represents ''moraba'a'' for a [[Square (algebra)|square]] (x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
*ﻙ (''[[Kāf|k]]'') represents ''moka'ab'' for a [[Cube (algebra)|cube]] (x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
*ﻝ (''[[Lām|l]]'') represents ''ya'adilu'' for [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]] (=)

As an example, the equation &lt;math&gt;2x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x + 5 = 0&lt;/math&gt; would have been written using his notation as:

&lt;span style="font-size:125%;"&gt; 2&lt;SPAN dir="ltr"&gt;ﻙ&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN dir="ltr"&gt;ﻭ &lt;/SPAN&gt; 3&lt;SPAN dir="ltr"&gt;ﻡ&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN dir="ltr"&gt;ﻻ&lt;/SPAN&gt; 4&lt;SPAN dir="ltr"&gt;ﺵ&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN dir="ltr"&gt;ﻭ&lt;/SPAN&gt; 5 &lt;SPAN dir="ltr"&gt;ﻝ&lt;/SPAN&gt; 0 &lt;/span&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1307">The '''American Posture League''' of the [[United States]] was established and initially funded by educator [[Jessie H. Bancroft]], Henry Ling Taylor, an orthopedic surgeon, and Dr. [[Eliza Mosher]]. The idea of the league was to combine scientific research with business: based on research in posture, they gave recommendations to businesses (manufacturers of footwear, furniture, etc.) and charging fees for contractual use the League labels. To the latter end, the '''Posture Standards Company''' was formed, to keep business separate from science, since the commercialization of science was one of the criticisms of the League. The enterprise was not a commercial success, but [[George J. Fisher]] (a former President of the League) notes that the founder trio were repaid all their investments, with the exception of the founding free gifts. &lt;ref&gt;[[George J. Fisher]], "The American Posture League", "The Journal of Health and Physical Education", Volume 6, Issue 8, 1935, {{doi|10.1080/23267240.1935.10625699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This field is very important in medicine, studied together with [[parasitology]]. Medical arthropodology is the study of the parasitic effect of arthropods, not only as parasites but also as vectors. The first annual '' Conference on Medical Arthropodology'' was held in [[Madurai]] ([[Tamil Nadu]]) in 2007.

'''Biological bet hedging''' occurs when organisms suffer decreased fitness in their typical conditions in exchange for increased fitness in stressful conditions.

== Overview ==

=== Categories ===
There are three categories (strategies) of bet-hedging: "conservative" bet-hedging, "diversified" bet-hedging, and "adaptive coin flipping."

====Conservative bet hedging====
In conservative bet hedging, individuals lower their expected fitness in exchange for a lower variance in fitness.  The idea of this strategy is for an organism to "always play it safe" by using the same successful low-risk strategy regardless of environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="strategies"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olofsson|first1=H.|last2=Ripa|first2=J.|last3=Jonzen|first3=N.|title=Bet-hedging as an evolutionary game: the trade-off between egg size and number|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=27 May 2009|volume=276|issue=1669|pages=2963–2969|doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.0500|pmc=2817213}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this would be an organism producing [[Clutch (eggs)|clutches]] with a constant egg size that may not be optimal for any environmental condition, but result in the lowest overall variance.&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt;

====Diversified bet hedging====
In contrast to conservative bet hedging, diversified bet hedging occurs when individuals lower their expected fitness in a given year while also increasing the variance of survival between offspring.  This strategy uses the idea of not "putting all of your eggs in a basket."&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt; Individuals implementing this strategy actually invest in several different strategies at once, resulting in low variation in long-term success.  This could be demonstrated by a clutch of eggs of different sizes, each optimal for one potential environment of the offspring.  While this means that offspring specialized for another environment are less likely to survive to adulthood, it also protects against the possibility of no offspring surviving to the next year.&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt;

====Adaptive coin flipping====
An individual using this type of bet hedging chooses what strategy to use based on a prediction of what the environment will be like. Organisms using this form of bet hedging make these predictions and select strategies annually.  For example, an organism may produce clutches of different egg sizes from year to year, increasing variation in offspring success between clutches.&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt;  Unlike conservative and diversified bet hedging strategies, adaptive coin flipping isn't concerned with minimizing the variation in fitness between years.

== Evolution ==
To determine if a bet hedging allele is favored, the long-term fitness of each allele must be compared.  Particularly in highly variable environments where bet hedging is likely to evolve, long-term fitness is best measured using the [[geometric mean]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dempster|first=Everett R.|date=1955-01-01|title=MAINTENANCE OF GENETIC HETEROGENEITY|url=http://symposium.cshlp.org/content/20/25|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology|language=en|volume=20|pages=25–32|doi=10.1101/SQB.1955.020.01.005|issn=0091-7451|pmid=13433552}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is multiplicative instead of additive like the [[arithmetic mean]].  The geometric mean is highly sensitive to small values.  Even rare occurrences of zero fitness for a [[genotype]] result in it having an expected geometric mean of zero. This makes it appropriate for circumstances where a single genotype may have variable fitness depending on environmental circumstances.

Bet hedging is understood to be a mode of response to environmental change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simons|first=Andrew M.|date=2011-06-07|title=Modes of response to environmental change and the elusive empirical evidence for bet hedging|journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences|volume=278|issue=1712|pages=1601–1609|doi=10.1098/rspb.2011.0176|issn=1471-2954|pmc=3081777|pmid=21411456}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptations that allow organisms to survive in fluctuating environmental conditions provide an evolutionary advantage.  While a bet hedging trait may not be optimal for any one environment, this is outweighed by the benefits of higher fitness across a variety of environments.  Therefore, bet hedging [[allele]]s tend to be favored in more variable environments.  In order for a bet hedging allele to spread, it must persist in the typical environment through [[genetic drift]] long enough for the alternative environment, in which the bet hedger has an advantage, to occur. At that point, selection may [[Selective sweep|sweep]] the allele to fixation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=King|first=Oliver D.|last2=Masel|first2=Joanna|date=2007-12-01|title=The evolution of bet-hedging adaptations to rare scenarios|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040580907000925|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|volume=72|issue=4|pages=560–575|doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2007.08.006|pmc=2118055|pmid=17915273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common example used when describing bet hedging is comparing the arithmetic and geometric fitness between specialist and bet hedging genotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Philippi|first=Tom|last2=Seger|first2=Jon|title=Hedging one's evolutionary bets, revisited|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0169534789901389|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|pages=41–44|doi=10.1016/0169-5347(89)90138-9|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxford surveys in evolutionary biology|last=Seger|first=Jon|last2=Brockmann|first2=H.

The good year specialist has the highest fitness during a good year but does very poorly during a bad year, while the reverse is true for a bad year specialist. The conservative bet hedger does equally well in all years and the diversified bet hedger in this example uses the two specialist strategies each 50% of the time; they perform better than the conservative bet hedger in good years, but worse during a bad year.

In this example, fitness is approximately equal within the specialist and bet hedger strategies, with the bet hedgers having a significantly higher fitness than the specialists. While the good year specialist' has the highest arithmetic mean, the bet hedging strategies are still preferred due to their higher geometric mean.

It is also important to realize that the fitness of any strategy is dependent on a large number of factors, such as the ratio of good to bad years and its relative fitness between good and bad years. Small changes in the strategies or environment having a large impact on which is optimal.  In the above example, the diversified bet hedger outweighs the conservative bet hedger if it uses the good year specialist strategy more often. In contrast, if the relative fitness of the good year specialist was 0.35 in a bad year, it becomes the optimal strategy.

== In organisms ==

=== Prokarya ===
Experiments in bet hedging using prokaryotic model organisms provide some of the most simplified views of the evolution of bet hedging. As bet hedging involves a stochastic switching between [[phenotype]]s across generations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beaumont | first1 = H. J. E. | last2 = Kost | first2 = C. | last3 = Rainey | first3 = P. B. | last4 = Gallie | first4 = J. | last5 = Ferguson | first5 = G. C. | year = 2009 | title = Experimental evolution of bet hedging | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 462 | issue = 7269| pages = 90–93 | doi = 10.1038/nature08504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[prokaryote]]s are able to display this phenomenon quite nicely due to their ability to reproduce quickly enough to track evolution in a single population over a short period of time. This rapid rate of reproduction has allowed for the study of bet hedging in labs through experimental evolution models. These models have been used to deduce the evolutionary origins of bet hedging.

Within prokarya, there are a multitude of bet hedging examples. In one example, the bacterium ''[[Sinorhizobium meliloti]]'' stores carbon and energy in a compound known as poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) in order to withstand carbon-deficient environments. When starved, ''S. meliloti'' populations begin to display bet hedging by forming two non-identical [[Cell division|daughter cells]] during [[Fission (biology)|binary fission]]. The daughter cells display either low PHB levels or high PHB levels, which are better suited to short and long-term starvation, respectively. It has been reported that the low-PHB must compete effectively for resources in order to survive, whereas the high-PHB cells can survive for over a year without food. In this example, the PHB phenotype is being ‘bet-hedged’, as the survivability of the offspring largely depends on their environment, where only one phenotype is likely to survive under specific conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ratcliff | first1 = W. C. | last2 = Denison | first2 = R. F. | year = 2010 | title = Individual-level bet hedging in the bacterium sinorhizobium meliloti | url = | journal = Current Biology | volume = 20 | issue = 19| pages = 1740–1744 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2010.08.036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of bet hedging arises in ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''. In a given population of this bacteria, persister cells exist with the ability to arrest their growth, which leaves them unaffected by dramatic changes to the environment. Once the persister cells grow to form another population of its species, which may or may not be [[Antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistant]], they will produce both cells with normal cell growth and another population of persisters to continue this cycle as the case may be. The ability to switch between the persister and normal phenotype is a form of bet-hedging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Veening | first1 = J. | last2 = Smits | first2 = W. K. | last3 = Kuipers | first3 = O. P. | year = 2008 | title = Bistability, epigenetics, and bet-hedging in bacteria | url = | journal = Annual Review of Microbiology | volume = 62 | issue = 1| pages = 193–210 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.62.081307.163002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prokaryotic persistence as a method of bet hedging is thus of importance to the field of medicine due to bacterial persistence. Because bet hedging is designed to produce genetically diverse offspring randomly in order to survive catastrophe, it is difficult to develop treatments for bacterial infections, as bet hedging may ensure the survival of its species within its host, heedless to the antibiotic.

=== Eukarya ===
Eukaryotic bet hedging models, unlike prokaryotic models, tend to be used to study more complex evolutionary proceces. In the context of eukaryotes, bet hedging is best used as a way to analyze complex environmental influences  affecting the selective pressures underlying the principle  of bet hedging. However, because Eukarya is a broad category, this section has been subdivided into kingdoms [[Animal]]ia, [[Plant]]ae, and [[Fungus|Fungi]].

==== Vertebrates ====
In example, West [[Atlantic salmon]] ([[Atlantic salmon|''Salmo salar'']]) have been hypothesized to have [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC)-dependent mating systems, which have been shown in other species to be important for determining disease resistance among offspring. Namely, there is evidence that selection for increased MHC diversity is a strong influence on mate choice, where it is thought that individuals are more likely to mate with individuals whose MHC is less similar to their own in order to produce variable offspring. In accordance with the bet hedging model, it has been found that the reproductive success of mating pairs of Atlantic salmon is environmentally dependent, where certain MHC constructs are only advantageous under specific environmental circumstances. Thus, this supports the evidence that MHC diversity is crucial for the long-term reproductive success of the parents, as the tradeoff for an initial decrease in short-term reproductive fitness is mediated by the survival of a few of their offspring in a variable environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Evans | first1 = M. L. | last2 = Dionne | first2 = M. | last3 = Miller | first3 = K. M. | last4 = Bernatchez | first4 = L. | year = 2012 | title = Mate choice for major histocompatibility complex genetic divergence as a bet-hedging strategy in the atlantic salmon (salmo salar) | url = | journal = Proceedings: Biological Sciences | volume = 279 | issue = | pages = 379–386 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2011.0909 | pmc = 3223684 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second example among vertebrates is the marsupial species [[Stripe-faced dunnart|''Sminthopsis macrour'']], which use a [[torpor]] strategy in order to reduce their metabolic rate to survive environmental changes. Reproductive [[hormone]] cycles have been shown to mediate the timing of torpor and reproduction, and in mice have been shown to mediate this process entirely, heedless to the environment. In the marsupial species, however, an adaptive coin flipping mechanism is employed where neither torpor nor reproduction are affected by manipulation of hormones, suggesting that this [[marsupial]] species makes a more active decision about when to use torpor that is better-suited to the uncertain environment in which it lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McAllan | first1 = B. M. | last2 = Feay | first2 = N. | last3 = Bradley | first3 = A. J. | last4 = Geiser | first4 = F. | year = 2012| title = The influence of reproductive hormones on the torpor patterns of the marsupial sminthopsis macroura: Bet-hedging in an unpredictable environment | url = | journal = General and Comparative Endocrinology | volume = 179 | issue = 2| pages = 265–276 | doi = 10.1016/j.ygcen.2012.08.024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Invertebrates ====
Many invertebrate species are known to exhibit various forms of bet hedging. ''Diaptomus sanguineus,'' an aquatic crustacean species found in many ponds of the Northeast United States, is one of the most well-studied examples of bet hedging. This species uses a form of diversified bet hedging called germ banking, in which emergence timing among offspring from a single clutch is highly variable. This reduces the potential costs of a catastrophic event during a particularly vulnerable time in offspring development. In ''Diaptomus sanguineus'', germ banking occurs when parents produce dormant eggs prior to annual environmental shifts that yield increased risk for developing offspring. For example, in temporary ponds, ''Diaptomus sanguineus'' production of dormant eggs peaks just before the annual dry season in June when ponds levels decrease. In permanent ponds, dormant egg production increases in March, just before an annual increase in feeding activity of sunfish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Margaret E K|last2=Dennehy|first2=John J|date=2005-12-01|title=Germ Banking: Bet‐Hedging and Variable Release from Egg and Seed Dormancy|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/498282|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=80|issue=4|pages=431–451|doi=10.1086/498282|issn=0033-5770}}&lt;/ref&gt; This example demonstrates that germ banking may take different forms within a species depending on the environmental risk presented. Bet hedging through variable egg hatching patterns are seen in other crustaceans as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Radzikowski|first=J.|date=2013-07-01|title=Resistance of dormant stages of planktonic invertebrates to adverse environmental conditions|url=https://academic.oup.com/plankt/article/35/4/707/1528340/Resistance-of-dormant-stages-of-planktonic|journal=Journal of Plankton Research|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=707–723|doi=10.1093/plankt/fbt032|issn=0142-7873}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hakalahti|first=Teija|last2=Häkkinen|first2=Heli|last3=Valtonen|first3=E.

Invertebrate bet-hedging has also been observed in the mating systems of some species of spider. Female sierra dome spiders (''Linyphia litigiosa)'' are polyandrous, mating with secondary males in order to compensate for uncertainty regarding the quality of the primary mate. Primary male mates are considered to be of higher fitness than secondary males, as primary mates must overcome intrasexual fighting prior to mating with a female, while secondary male mates are chosen through female choice. Scientists believe multiple paternity has evolved in response to virgin insemination by low quality secondary male mates who have not undergone selection through intrasexual fighting. Females have developed a mechanism for sperm precedence to retain control over offspring paternity and increase offspring fitness. Further examination of female genitalia has supported this hypothesis. The sierra dome spider exhibits this behavior as a form of genetic bet hedging, reducing the risk of producing low quality offspring and contracting venereal disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Paul J.|date=1991-02-01|title=Multiple paternity as genetic bet-hedging in female sierra dome spiders, Linyphia litigiosa (Linyphiidae)|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347205804865|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=41|issue=2|pages=343–360|doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(05)80486-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of bet hedging is notably different than most other forms of bet hedging, as it has not arisen in response to environmental conditions, but rather it has arisen as a result of the species mating system.

===== Fungi =====

Bet hedging is employed in fungi similarly to bacteria, but in fungi, it is more complex. This phenomenon is beneficial to fungi, but in some cases, it has harmful effects on humans, illustrating that bet hedging has clinical importance. One study suggests that bet hedging may even contribute to the failure of chemotherapy in cancer due to mechanisms similar to that of bet hedging used in fungi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meadows|first1=Robin|title=Yeast Survive by Hedging Their Bets|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001327|website=PLOS Biology|pages=e1001327|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001327|date=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way fungi use bet hedging is by displaying different colony morphologies when grown on agar plates.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levy|first1=Sasha F.|last2=Ziv|first2=Naomi|last3=Siegal|first3=Mark L.|title=Bet Hedging in Yeast by Heterogeneous, Age-Correlated Expression of a Stress Protectant|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001325|website=PLOS Biology|pages=e1001325|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001325|date=8 May 2012|volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This variation allows for colonies with different morphologies, including resistances that allow them to survive, to thrive and reproduce in different conditions or environments. As a result, fungal infections may be more difficult to treat if bet hedging is involved. For example, pathogenic strains of yeast like ''[[Candida albicans]]'' or ''[[Candida glabrata]]'' using this strategy will resist treatments. These fungi are known to cause an infection known as [[candidiasis]].

While bet hedging in fungi is important, not much is known about the mechanisms for the different strategies employed by different species. Researchers have studied ''[[S. cerevisiae]]'' to determine the mechanism of bet hedging in this species.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It was determined that in ''S. cerevisiae'', variation exists in the distribution of growth rates among yeast micro-colonies and that slow growth is a predictor of resistance to heat. Tsl1 is one gene that was determined as a factor in this resistance. The abundance of this gene was shown to correlate with heat and stress resistance, and thus survival of the yeast micro-colonies under harsh conditions by using bet hedging. This illustrates that by using bet hedging, pathogenic strains of this yeast that are harmful to humans are more difficult to treat.

A group of researchers studied another way bet hedging is used by looking at the ascomycete fungus ''[[Neurospora crassa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Graham|first1=Jeffrey K.|last2=Smith|first2=Myron L.|last3=Simons|first3=Andrew M.|title=Experimental evolution of bet hedging under manipulated environmental uncertainty in Neurospora crassa|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1787/20140706|website=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|pages=20140706|language=en|doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.0706|date=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was observed that this species produces [[ascospores]] with variation in their dormancy because non-dormant ascospores can be killed by heat, but dormant ascospores will survive. The only con is that it will take longer for the dormant ascopores to be germinated.

==== Plantae ====
Plants provide simple examples for studying bet hedging in wildlife, allowing for field studies but without as many confounding factors as animals.  Studying closely related plant species can help us understand more about the circumstances under which bet hedging evolves.

The classic example of bet hedging, delayed seed germination,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; has been extensively studied in desert annuals.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clauss|first=M. J.|last2=Venable|first2=D. L.|date=2000-02-01|title=Seed Germination in Desert Annuals: An Empirical Test of Adaptive Bet Hedging.|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/303314|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=155|issue=2|pages=168–186|doi=10.1086/303314|issn=0003-0147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Philippi|first=Thomas|date=1993-09-01|title=Bet-Hedging Germination of Desert Annuals: Variation Among Populations and Maternal Effects in Lepidium lasiocarpum|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/285551|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=142|issue=3|pages=488–507|doi=10.1086/285551|issn=0003-0147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gremer|first=Jennifer R.|last2=Venable|first2=D. Lawrence|date=2014-03-01|title=Bet hedging in desert winter annual plants: optimal germination strategies in a variable environment|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12241/abstract|journal=Ecology Letters|language=en|volume=17|issue=3|pages=380–387|doi=10.1111/ele.12241|issn=1461-0248}}&lt;/ref&gt; One four-year field study&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; found that populations in historically worse (drier) environments had lower germination rates. They also found a large range of germination dates and flexibility in germination for drier populations when exposed to rain, a phenomenon known as [[phenotypic plasticity]]. Other studies of desert annuals&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; have also found a relationship between temporal variation and lower germination rates. One of these  studies&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; also found the density of seeds in the seed bank to affect germination rates.

Bet hedging through a seed bank has also been implicated in the persistence of weeds. One study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=H. A.|last2=Feast|first2=Patricia M.|date=1972-12-01|title=Fate of Seeds of Some Annual Weeds in Different Depths of Cultivated and Undisturbed Soil|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3180.1972.tb01226.x/abstract|journal=Weed Research|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=316–324|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3180.1972.tb01226.x|issn=1365-3180}}&lt;/ref&gt; of twenty weed species showed that the percentage of viable seeds after 5 years increased with soil depth, and germination rates decreased with soil depth (although specific numbers varied between species). This indicates that weeds will engage in bet hedging at higher rates in circumstances where the costs of bet hedging are lower.

Collectively, these findings do provide evidence for bet hedging in plants, but also show the importance of competition and phenotypic plasticity that simple bet hedging models often ignore.

=== Archaea ===
Thus far, research on bet hedging involving species in the domain [[Archaea]] hasn't been easily accessible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1866">'''Blue stain fungi''' (also known as '''sap stain fungi''') is a vague term including various [[fungi]] that cause dark staining in sapwood.&lt;ref name="schmidt"&gt;{{cite book | first=Olaf | last=Schmidt | title=Wood and Tree Fungi | year=2006 | publisher=Springer | isbn=3-540-32138-1 | pages=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The staining is most often blue, but could also be grey or black. Because the grouping is based solely on symptomatics, it is not [[monophyletic]].

== Included species ==
Depending on the author, the group can include between 100–250 species of [[Ascomycetes]] and [[Deuteromycetes]]. They are usually divided into three different groups:&lt;ref name="schmidt" /&gt;
# Ascomycetes fungi from the genera [[Ceratocystis]], [[Ophiostoma]], [[Ceratocystiopsis]], [[Grosmannia]]. These are usually transmitted between trees by bark beetles of the subfamily [[Scolytinae]].
# Several [[Black yeast|Black yeasts]] like [[Hormonema dematioides]], [[Aureobasidium pullulans]], [[Rhinocladiella atrovirens]], and [[Phialophora]] species.
# Several dark molds like [[Alternaria alternata]], [[Cladosporium sphaerospermum]] and [[Cladosporium cladosporioides|C. cladosporioides]].

== Economic importance ==

{{Refimprove|date=August 2014}}[[File:Cairn at Garvera, Surselva, Graubuenden, Switzerland.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A cairn marking a mountain summit in [[Graubünden]], [[Switzerland]] ]]
A '''cairn''' is a human-made pile (or stack) of stones. The word ''cairn'' comes from the {{lang-gd|càrn}} {{IPA-gd|ˈkʰaːrˠn̪ˠ||}} (plural {{lang|gd|càirn}} {{IPA-gd|ˈkʰaːrˠɲ||}}).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Drummond, ''Scottish Hill Names'', Scottish Mountaineering Trust (2010), {{ISBN|978-0-907521-95-2}}, page 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Cairns have been and are used for a broad variety of purposes, from prehistoric times to the present.

In [[modern time]]s, cairns are often erected as [[landmark]]s, a use they have had since [[ancient times]]. However, since [[prehistory]], they have also been built and used as [[Sepulchre|burial]] monuments; for defense and hunting; for ceremonial purposes, sometimes relating to  [[astronomy]]; to locate buried items, such as caches of food or objects; and to mark trails, among other purposes.

[[File:Cairn Northumberland and Durham.jpg|thumb|Cairn at the boundary of Counties Durham and Northumberland UK]]

Cairns are used as [[Trail blazing|trail markers]] in many parts of the world, in [[Upland (geology)|uplands]], on  [[moorland]],   on  [[Summit (topography)|mountaintops]], near [[waterway]]s and on [[sea cliff]]s, as well as in barren [[desert]]s and [[tundra]]. They vary in size from small stone markers to entire artificial hills, and in complexity from loose conical rock piles to delicately balanced sculptures and elaborate feats of [[megalith]]ic engineering. Cairns may be painted or otherwise decorated, whether for increased visibility or for religious reasons. An ancient example is the [[inuksuk]] (plural inuksuit), used by the [[Inuit]], [[Inupiat]], [[Kalaallit]], [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]], and other peoples of the [[Arctic]] region of North America.  Inuksuit are found from [[Alaska]] to [[Greenland]]. This region, above the [[Arctic Circle]], is dominated by the tundra [[biome]] and has areas with few natural [[landmark]]s.

==Modern cairns==
[[File:Lion's Head snow.JPG|right|thumb|upright=1.2|Line of cairns used to mark the way above the treeline on [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington, New Hampshire]], US]]
Different types of cairns exist from rough piles of stones to interlocking dry stone round cylinders.  The most important cairns commonly used around the world are interlocking stone survey cairns constructed around a central survey mark about every 30&amp;nbsp;km on the tallest peaks across a nation. These physical survey mark cairn systems are the basis for national survey grids to interconnect individual land survey measurements for entire nations. On occasion these permanent interlocking stone cairns are taken down then reconstructed to re-mark measurements to increase the accuracy of the national survey grid. They can also be used in unpopulated countries as emergency location points.  In [[North America]] and [[Northern Europe]] any type of cairn can be used to mark [[mountain bike]] and [[hiking trail]]s and other cross-country [[trail blazing]], especially in mountain regions at or above the [[tree line]]. For example, the extensive trail network maintained by the DNT, the [[Norwegian Trekking Association]], extensively uses cairns in conjunction with T-painted rock faces to mark trails.  Other examples of these can be seen in the lava fields of [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Volcanoes National Park]] to mark several hikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/havo/planyourvisit/hike_bc.htm |title=Backcountry Hikes - Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park |publisher=Nps.gov |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placed at regular intervals, a series of cairns can be used to indicate a path across stony or barren terrain, even across [[glacier]]s. Such cairns are often placed at junctions or in places where the trail direction is not obvious. They may also be used to indicate an obscured danger such as a sudden drop, or a noteworthy point such as the summit of a mountain.  Most trail cairns are small, usually being a foot or less in height. However, they may be built taller so as to protrude through a layer of snow. Hikers passing by often add a stone, as a small bit of maintenance to counteract the erosive effects of severe weather. North American trail marks are sometimes called "ducks" or "duckies", because they sometimes have a "beak" pointing in the direction of the route. The expression "two rocks do not make a duck" reminds hikers that just one rock resting upon another could be the result of accident or nature rather than intentional trail marking.

The building of cairns for recreational purposes along trails, to mark one's personal passage through the area, can result in an overabundance of rock piles. This distracts from cairns used as genuine navigational guides, and also conflicts with the [[Leave No Trace]] ethic. This ethic of outdoor practice advocates for leaving the outdoors undisturbed and in its natural condition.
[[File:Isandlwanamassgrave.JPG|left|thumb|200px|One of many cairns marking British mass graves at the site of the [[Battle of Isandlwana]] (1879), [[South Africa]]]]
Coastal cairns, or "sea marks", are also common in the northern latitudes, especially in the island-strewn waters of [[Scandinavia]] and eastern [[Canada]]. Often indicated on navigation charts, they may be painted white or lit as beacons for greater visibility offshore.

Modern cairns may also be erected for historical or memorial commemoration or simply for decorative or artistic reasons. One example is a series of many cairns marking [[United Kingdom|British]] soldiers' [[mass graves]] at the site of the [[Battle of Isandlwana]], [[South Africa]]. Another is the [[Matthew Flinders]] Cairn on the side of [[Arthur's Seat, Victoria|Arthur's Seat]], a small mountain on the shores of [[Port Phillip Bay]], [[Australia]]. A large cairn, commonly referred to as "the igloo" by the locals, was built atop a hill next to the [[I-476]] highway in [[Radnor, Pennsylvania]] and is a part of a series of large rock sculptures initiated in 1988 to symbolize the township's [[Wales|Welsh]] heritage and to beautify the visual imagery along the highway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radnor.com/department/division.asp?fDD=9-108 Radnor Township website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820120212/http://www.radnor.com/department/division.asp?fDD=9-108 |date=2007-08-20 }}, Gateway Enhancement Strategy.&lt;/ref&gt; Some are merely places where farmers have collected stones removed from a field. These can be seen in the [[Catskill Mountains]], [[North America]] where there is a strong Scottish heritage, and may also represent places where livestock were lost. In locales exhibiting fantastic rock formations, such as the [[Grand Canyon]], tourists often construct simple cairns in reverence of the larger counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[[:commons:File:Cairns at Grand Canyon North Rim 2013.jpg]]{{Better source|date=December 2016|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, cairns may have a strong aesthetic purpose, for example in the art of [[Andy Goldsworthy]].

===Illegal construction===
Norwegian authorities said in 2015 that illegal cairns are being built each year, to a large degree by tourists to Norway; part of the problem is that individual stones are being removed from registered- and unregistered ''kulturminner'' (e.g., historical monuments).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrk.no/finnmark/_-ulovlige-varder-er-blitt-en-farsott-1.12499962 – Ulovlige varder er blitt en farsott] [– Illegal cairns have become a craze]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Clear}}

===Europe===
The building of cairns for various purposes goes back into [[prehistory]] in [[Eurasia]], ranging in size from small rock sculptures to substantial man-made hills of stone (some built on top of larger, natural hills). The latter are often relatively massive [[Bronze Age]] or earlier structures which, like kistvaens and [[dolmen]]s, frequently contain burials; they are comparable to [[Tumulus|tumuli]] ([[kurgan]]s), but of stone construction instead of [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]]. ''Cairn'' originally could more broadly refer to various types of hills and natural stone piles, but today is used exclusively of artificial ones.
[[File:Cairn Gavrinis exterieur.jpg|thumb|Cairn of the [[Neolithic]]-era [[passage grave]] on [[Gavrinis]] island, [[Brittany]]]]
The word ''cairn'' derives from [[Scots language|Scots]] {{lang|gd|cairn}} (with the same meaning), in turn from [[Scottish Gaelic]] {{lang|gd|càrn}}, which is essentially the same as the corresponding words in other native [[Celtic language]]s of [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Ireland]] and [[Brittany]], including [[Welsh language|Welsh]] {{lang|cy|carn}} (and {{lang|cy|carnedd}}), [[Breton language|Breton]] {{lang|br|karn}}, [[Irish language|Irish]] {{lang|ga|carn}}, and [[Cornish language|Cornish]] {{lang|kw|karn}} or {{lang|kw|carn}}.  Cornwall ({{lang|kw|Kernow}}) itself may actually be named after the cairns that dot its landscape, such as Cornwall's highest point, [[Brown Willy Cairns|Brown Willy Summit Cairn]], a 5&amp;nbsp;m (16&amp;nbsp;ft) high and 24&amp;nbsp;m (79&amp;nbsp;ft) diameter mound atop [[Brown Willy]] hill in [[Bodmin Moor]], an area with many ancient cairns.  Burial cairns and other [[megalith]]s are the subject of a variety of legends and folklore throughout Britain and Ireland. In [[Scotland]], it is traditional to carry a stone up from the bottom of a hill to place on a cairn at its top. In such a fashion, cairns would grow ever larger. An old Scottish Gaelic blessing is {{lang|gd|Cuiridh mi clach air do chàrn}}, "I'll put a stone on your stone".  In Highland folklore it is recounted that before Highland clans fought in a battle, each man would place a stone in a pile. Those who survived the battle returned and removed a stone from the pile. The stones that remained were built into a cairn to honour the dead. Cairns in the region were also put to vital practical use. For example, [[Dún Aonghasa]], an all-stone [[Iron Age]] Irish [[hill fort]] on [[Inishmore]] in the [[Aran Islands]], is still surrounded by small cairns and strategically placed jutting rocks, used collectively as an alternative to [[Defensive wall|defensive earthworks]] because of the [[karst]] landscape's lack of soil.
[[File:BorderPost272 - Norway and Sweden.jpg|thumb|The [[Stone Cairn (Riksrösen)|Riksrösen]] divide Norway and Sweden.]]
In [[Scandinavia]], cairns have been used for centuries as trail and sea marks, among other purposes. In [[Iceland]], cairns were often used as markers along the numerous single-file roads or paths that crisscrossed the island; many of these ancient cairns are still standing, although the paths have disappeared. In [[Norse Greenland]], cairns were used as a hunting implement, a game-driving "lane", used to direct reindeer towards a [[game jump]].&lt;ref&gt;Arneborg 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mythology of ancient Greece, cairns were associated with [[Hermes]], the god of overland travel. According to one legend, Hermes was put on trial by [[Hera]] for slaying her favorite servant, the monster [[Argus Panoptes|Argus]]. All of the other gods acted as a jury, and as a way of declaring their verdict they were given pebbles, and told to throw them at whichever person they deemed to be in the right, Hermes or Hera. Hermes argued so skillfully that he ended up buried under a heap of pebbles, and this was the first cairn.
In [[Croatia]], in areas of ancient [[Dalmatia]], such as [[Herzegovina]] and the [[Krajina]], they are known as ''gromila''.

In [[Portugal]] a cairn is called  a {{lang|pt|moledro}}. In a legend the moledros are enchanted soldiers, and if one stone is taken from the pile and put under a pillow, in the morning a soldier will appear for a brief moment, then will change back to a stone and magically return to the pile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Genética e a Teoria da Continuidade Paleolítica aplicada à Lenda da Fundação de Portugal e Escócia Apenas Livros|year=2008|isbn=978-989-618-180-2|url=http://www.continuitas.org/texts/morais_genetica.pdf|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cairns that mark the place where someone died or cover the graves alongside the roads where in the past people were buried are called {{lang|pt|Fiéis de Deus}}. The same name given to the stones was given to  the dead whose identity was unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SoUyAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Diccionario+da+lingua+portugueza:+recopilado+dos+vocabularios+impressos#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Diccionario da lingua portugueza:recopilado dos vocabularios impressos até agora, e nesta segunda edição novamente emendado, e muito accrescentado, Volume 2. pg 31 |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30|year=1813 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{lang|gl|Fieis de Deus}} or {{lang|gl|Fes de Deus}} are, in the Galician legends, spirits of the night. The word "Fes" or "Fieis" is thought to mean [[fairy]], the same root as "fate"&lt;ref&gt;[http://sli.uvigo.es/ddd/ddd_pescuda.php?pescuda=fes&amp;tipo_busca=lema ''Dicionario de Dicionarios. Corpus lexicográfico da lingua galega'']. ''Dicionario de Dicionarios''. "Entienden por éstos o estas fes los espíritus nocturnos, fantasmas, espectros, etc. Acaso serán lo mismo que las fees en francés, y todo de fata." Retrieved January 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; (''fado''), that can take the same meaning as the proto-Celtic *bato-, meaning "death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spns.org.uk/ProtoCelt.pdf |title=Proto-Celtic―English |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cairns are also common on the [[Mediterranean]] island of [[Corsica]].{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=Please give examples}}

===North and northeast Africa===
[[File:Qableh3.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Ancient cairns in [[Qa’ableh]], [[Somalia]]]]
Cairns (''taalo'') are a common feature at [[El Ayo]], [[Haylan]], [[Qa’ableh]], [[Qombo'ul]], [[Heis (town)|Heis]], [[Salweyn]] and [[Macajilayn]], among other places. Northern [[Somalia]] in general is home to a lot of such historical settlements and [[archaeological site]]s wherein are found numerous ancient ruins and buildings, many of obscure origins. However, many of these old structures have yet to be properly explored, a process which would help shed further light on local history and facilitate their preservation for posterity.&lt;ref name="Hodd"&gt;Michael Hodd, ''East African Handbook'', (Trade &amp; Travel Publications: 1994), p.640.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[Neolithic]] times, the climate of [[North Africa]] has become drier. A reminder of the [[desertification]] of the area is provided by [[megalith]]ic remains, which occur in a great variety of forms and in vast numbers in presently arid and uninhabitable wastelands: cairns (''kerkour''), [[dolmen]]s and circles like [[Stonehenge]], underground cells excavated in rock, [[Long barrow|barrows]] topped with huge slabs, and step [[pyramid]]-like mounds.

===Asia and the Pacific===
Starting in the [[Bronze Age]],{{clarify|date=March 2011|reason=WHERE?!? "Asia" is huge.}} burial [[cist]]s were sometimes interred into cairns, which would be situated in conspicuous positions, often on the skyline above the village of the deceased. The stones may have been thought to deter grave robbers and scavengers. A more sinister explanation is that they were to [[Revenant (folklore)|stop the dead from rising]]. There remains a [[Judaism|Jewish]] tradition of placing small stones on a person's grave as a token of respect, though this is generally to relate the longevity of stone to the eternal nature of the soul and is not usually done in a cairn fashion. [[Stupa]]s in India and [[Tibet]] probably started out in a similar fashion, although they now generally contain the ashes of a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] saint or [[lama]].

[[File:TallOvoo.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A Mongolian ceremonial cairn (''[[ovoo]]'')]]A traditional and often decorated, heap-formed cairn called an ''[[ovoo]]'' is made in [[Mongolia]]. It primarily serves religious purposes, and finds use in both [[Tengriism|Tengriist]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ceremonies.

In [[Hawaii]], cairns are called by the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] word {{lang|haw|ahu}}.{{clarify|date=March 2011|reason=So what? Is this an ancient thing? If so, tell us about it and cite sources. If it's just the word for modern trail cairns on the volcanoes, then remove this entire paragraph since this isn't Wiktionary, and WP isn't here to provide translation services.}}

In [[South Korea]] cairns are quite prevalent, often found along roadsides and trails, up on mountain peaks, and adjacent to Buddhist temples.  Hikers frequently add stones to existing cairns trying to get just one more on top of the pile, to bring good luck.  This tradition has its roots in the worship of San-shin, or Mountain Spirit, so often still revered in Korean culture.&lt;ref name="san"&gt;{{cite book | title=Spirit of the Mountains - Korea's San-Shin and Traditions of Mountain Worship| last=Mason| first=David| year=1999| page=41| publisher=Hollym International Corp.| location=Seoul, South Korea and Elizabeth, New Jersey| isbn=1-56591-107-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Americas===
[[File:Flag of Nunavut.svg|thumb|An inuksuk on the [[flag of Nunavut]]]]
Throughout what today are the [[continental United States]] and Canada, cairns still mark [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]]' game-driving "lanes" leading to [[buffalo jump]]s, some of which may date to 12,000 years ago.
Natives of arctic North America (i.e. northern Canada, [[Alaska]] and indigenous [[Greenland]]) have built carefully constructed cairns and stone sculptures, called by names such as [[Inuksuk|{{lang|iu|inuksuit|nocat=yes}} and {{lang|iu|inunnguat|nocat=yes}}]], as landmarks and directional markers since [[European colonization of the Americas|before contact with Europeans]]. They are iconic of the region (an {{lang|iu|inuksuk}} even features on the flag of the Canadian far-northeastern territory, [[Nunavut]]), and are increasingly used as a symbol of Canadian national identity. {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In North America, cairns are often [[petroform]]s in the shapes of turtles or other animals.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Cairns have been used since [[pre-Columbian]] times throughout what is now [[Latin America]] to mark trails. Even today, in the [[Andes]] of [[South America]], the [[Quechuan]] peoples use cairns as religious shrines to the indigenous [[Inca]] goddess [[Pachamama]]. This is often part of a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] form of [[Roman Catholicism]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Anthropomorphism==
Although the practice is not common in [[Modern English language|English]], cairns are sometimes referred to by their [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] qualities. In [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], a cairn is known as {{lang|de|steinmann}} and {{lang|nl|steenman}} respectively, meaning literally "stone man".  A form of the [[Inuit]] {{lang|iu|[[inuksuk]]}} is also meant to represent a human figure, and is called an {{lang|iu|inunguak}} ("imitation of a person"). In Italy, especially the [[Italian Alps]], a cairn is an {{lang|it|ometto}}, or a "small man".
&lt;!--Don't need this yet: {{clear|right}}--&gt;

==Sea cairns==
[[File:Kummel Korpo 2009.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Sea mark]] in [[Finland|Finnish]] coastal waters]]
Coastal cairns called [[sea mark]]s are also common in the northern latitudes, and are placed along shores and on islands and islets. Usually painted white for improved offshore visibility, they serve as [[Navigational aid|navigation aid]]s. In [[Sweden]] they are called {{lang|sv|kummel}}, in Norway {{lang|no|varde}}, and are indicated in navigation charts and maintained as part of the nautical marking system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url=http://portal.fma.fi/portal/page/portal/589032C37AAC7314E040B40A0A016368 |title=Legend (INT Symbology) |format=PDF |location=[[Helsinki]] |publisher=Finnish Transport Agency and Finnish Transport Safety Agency (TraFi) |work=Merenkulku.fi |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126004546/http://portal.fma.fi/portal/page/portal/589032C37AAC7314E040B40A0A016368 |archivedate=2012-01-26 |df= }} Three-language key to reading Finnish navigation charts.&lt;/ref&gt; Inversely, they are used on land as sea cliff warnings in rugged and hilly terrain in the foggy [[Faroe Islands]]. In the [[Maritimes|Canadian Maritimes]], cairns have been used as beacons like small [[lighthouse]]s to guide boats, as depicted in the novel ''[[The Shipping News]]''.

Most successful attempts involve the cooperation and coordination of many institutions.

== History ==
[[Image:Red wolf pups - captive breeding.jpg|thumb|[[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|USFWS]] staff with two [[red wolf]] pups bred in captivity]]
[[File:Arabian oryx (oryx leucoryx).jpg|thumb|The Arabian Oryx is one of the first animals reintroduced via a captive breeding program.]]
Captive breeding techniques began with the first human domestication of animals such as goats, and plants like wheat, at least 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/domestication/|title=domestication|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-01-21|work=National Geographic Society|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These practices were then expanded with the rise of the first [[zoo]]s, which started as royal menageries in Egypt&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://daily.jstor.org/leopards-hippos-cats-oh-worlds-first-zoo/|title=The World's First Zoo {{!}} JSTOR Daily|date=2015-11-12|work=JSTOR Daily|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its popularity, which led to the increase in zoos worldwide. The first actual captive breeding programs were only started in the 1960s. These programs, such as the [[Arabian oryx|Arabian Oryx]] breeding program from The Phoenix Zoo in 1962, were aimed at the reintroduction of these species into the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/the-loneliest-animals/captive-breeding-success-stories/4920/|title=The Loneliest Animals {{!}} Captive Breeding Success Stories {{!}} Nature {{!}} PBS|date=2009-04-01|work=Nature|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs expanded under The [[Endangered Species Act of 1973]] of the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon Administration]], which focused on protecting endangered species and their habitats to preserve biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animallaw.info/articles/dduszoos.htm|title=Detailed Discussion of the Laws Affecting Zoos {{!}} Animal Legal &amp; Historical Center|website=www.animallaw.info|language=en|access-date=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, research and conservation centers have been housed in zoos, such as the Institute for Conservation Research at the San Diego Zoo founded in 1975 and expanded in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2008-06-28|title=BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE AT THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF SAN DIEGO|journal=International Zoo Yearbook|volume=3|issue=1|pages=126–127|doi=10.1111/j.1748-1090.1962.tb03439.x|issn=0074-9664}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have contributed to the successful conservation efforts of species such as the [[Hawaiian crow|Hawaiian Crow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://institute.sandiegozoo.org/species/alala|title='Alala|date=2015-09-18|work=San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coordination==
The breeding of species of conservation concern is coordinated by cooperative breeding programs containing international studbooks and coordinators, who evaluate the roles of individual animals and institutions from a global or regional perspective. These studbooks contain information on birth date, gender, location, and lineage (if known), which helps determine survival and reproduction rates, number of founders of the population, and inbreeding coefficients.&lt;ref name=smithsonian&gt;{{cite web| title = Captive Breeding Populations| work = [[Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute]]| url = http://nationalzoo.si.edu/scbi/endangeredspecies/capbreedpops/default.cfm| deadurl = yes| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100612095538/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/SCBI/EndangeredSpecies/CapBreedPops/default.cfm| archive-date = 2010-06-12| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A species coordinator reviews the information in studbooks and determines a breeding strategy that would produce most advantageous offspring.

If two compatible animals are found at different zoos, the animals may be transported for mating, but this is stressful, which could in turn make mating less likely. However, this is still a popular breeding method among European zoological organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = European Association of Zoos and Aquaria| title = EEPs and ESBs| date = 2015-02-05| url=http://www.eaza.net/activities/cp/Pages/EEPs.aspx | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205074701/http://www.eaza.net/activities/cp/Pages/EEPs.aspx | archive-date=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Artificial fertilization]] (by shipping semen) is another option, but male animals can experience stress during semen collection, and the same goes for females during the artificial insemination procedure. Furthermore, this approach yields lower-quality semen, because shipping requires extending the life of the sperm for the transit time.

== Challenges ==

===Genetics===
The objective of many captive populations is to hold similar levels of  genetic diversity to what is found in wild populations. As captive populations are usually small and maintained in artificial environments, genetics factors such as adaptation, inbreeding and loss of diversity can be a major concern.

==== [[Domestication]] (Adaptation) ====
Adaptive differences between plant and animal populations arise due to variations in environmental pressures. In the case of captive breeding prior to reintroduction into the wild, it's possible for species to evolve to adapt to the captive environment, rather than their natural environment.[11] Reintroducing a plant or animal to an environment dissimilar to the one they were originally from can cause fixation of traits that may not be suited for that environment leaving the individual disadvantaged. Selection intensity, initial genetic diversity, and effective population size can impact how much the species adapts to its captive environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03399.x |pmid=18173504 |title=Genetic adaptation to captivity in species conservation programs |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=325–33 |year=2008 |last1=Frankham |first1=Richard }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modeling works indicate that the duration of the programs (i.e., time from the foundation of the captive population to the last release event) is an important determinant of reintroduction success. Success is maximized for intermediate project duration allowing the release of a sufficient number of individuals, while minimizing the number of generations undergoing relaxed selection in captivity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2009.07.016 |title=Captive breeding genetics and reintroduction success |journal=Biological Conservation |volume=142 |issue=12 |pages=2915–22 |year=2009 |last1=Robert |first1=Alexandre }}&lt;/ref&gt; Can be minimized by reducing the number of generations in captivity, minimizing selection for captive adaptations by creating environment similar to natural environment and maximizing the number of immigrants from wild populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to conservation genetics |year=2010 |first1=Richard |last1=Frankham |first2=J D |last2=Ballou |first3=David A |last3=Briscoe |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-87847-0 |edition=2nd |location=Cambridge |oclc=268793768 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Genetic diversity ====
One consequence of small captive population size is the increased impact of [[genetic drift]], where genes have the potential to fix or disappear completely by chance, thereby reducing genetic diversity. Other factors that can impact genetic diversity in a captive population are bottlenecks and initial population size. [[Population bottleneck|Bottlenecks]], such as rapid decline in the population or a small initial population impacts genetic diversity. Loss can be minimized by establishing a population with a large enough number of founders to genetically represent the wild population, maximize population size, maximize ratio of effective population size to actual population size, and minimize the number of generations in captivity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== [[Inbreeding]] ====
Inbreeding is when organisms mate with closely related individuals, lowering [[Zygosity|heterozygosity]] in a population. Although inbreeding can be relatively common, when it results in a reduction in fitness it is known as [[inbreeding depression]]. The detrimental effects of inbreeding depression are especially prevalent in smaller populations and can therefore be extensive in captive populations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalinowski|first=Steven T.|date=2018|title=Inbreeding Depression in the Speke's Gazelle Captive Breeding Program|url=|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=14|pages=1375–1384|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make these populations the most viable, it is important to monitor and reduce the effects of deleterious allele expression caused by inbreeding depression and to restore genetic diversity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Comparing inbred populations against non-inbred or less-inbred populations can help determine the extent of detrimental effects if any are present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grueber|first=Catherine E.|date=2015|title=Impacts of early viability selection on management if inbreeding and genetic diversity in conservation|url=|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=24|pages=962–1083|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closely monitoring the possibility of inbreeding within the captive bred population is also key to the success of reintroduction into the species' native habitat. [[File:Speke's Gazelle.jpg|thumb|The Speke's Gazelle was the focus of a captive breeding program centered on determining the effect of selection on reducing genetic load.]]

===== [[Outbreeding depression|Outbreeding]] =====
Outbreeding is when organisms mate with unrelated individuals, increasing heterozygosity in a population. Although new diversity is often beneficial, if there a large genetic differences between the two individuals it can result in outbreeding depression. This is a reduction in fitness, similar to that of inbreeding depression, but arises from a number of different mechanisms, including taxonomic issues, chromosomal differences, sexual incompatibility, or adaptive differences between the individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frankham|first=Richard|date=2011|title=Predicting the Probability of Outbreeding Depression|url=|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=25|pages=465–475|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common cause is chromosomal ploidy differences and hybridization between individuals leading to sterility. The best example is in the [[orangutan]], which, prior to taxonomic revisions in the 1980s would be commonly mated in captive populations producing [[hybrid orangutan]]s with lower fitness {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}. If chromosomal ploidy is ignored during reintroduction, restoration efforts would fail due to sterile hybrids in the wild. If there are large genetic differences between individuals originally from distant populations, those individuals should only be bred in circumstances where no other mates exist.

====Behavior Changes====
Captive breeding can contribute to changes in behavior in animals that have been reintroduced to the wild. Released animals are commonly less capable of hunting or foraging for food, which leads to [[starvation]], possibly because the young animals spent the critical learning period in captivity. Released animals often display more risk-taking behavior and fail to avoid [[predator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McPhee|first=M. Elsbeth|date=2003|title=Generations in captivity increases behavioral variance: considerations for captive breeding and reintroduction programs|url=https://www.uwosh.edu/facstaff/mcpheem/private-docs/cv-documents/McPhee%202003%20BC.pdf|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=115|pages=71–77|via=|doi=10.1016/s0006-3207(03)00095-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Golden lion tamarin]] mothers often die in the wild before having [[offspring]] because they cannot climb and forage. This leads to continuing population declines despite [[reintroduction]] as the species are unable to produce [[:wikt:viable|viable]] [[offspring]]. Training can improve anti-predator skills, but its effectiveness varies.&lt;ref name="JJWPT91" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CB2000" /&gt;

Salmon bred in captivity have shown similar declines in caution and are killed by predators when young. However, salmon that were reared in an enriched environment with natural prey showed less risk-taking behaviors and were more likely to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-07-01|title=Environmental enrichment reduces maladaptive risk-taking behavior in salmon reared for conservation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320711001571|journal=Biological Conservation|language=en|volume=144|issue=7|pages=1972–1979|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2011.04.017|issn=0006-3207|last1=Roberts|first1=L.J.|last2=Taylor|first2=J.|last3=Garcia De Leaniz|first3=C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on [[Mouse|mice]] has found that after captive breeding had been in place for multiple generations and these mice were "released" to breed with wild mice, that the captive-born mice bred amongst themselves instead of with the wild mice. This suggests that captive breeding may affect mating preferences, and has implications for the success of a reintroduction program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Slade B, Parrott ML, Paproth A, Magrath MJ, Gillespie GR, Jessop TS | title = Assortative mating among animals of captive and wild origin following experimental conservation releases | journal = Biology Letters | volume = 10 | issue = 11 | pages = 20140656 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25411380 | pmc = 4261860 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2014.0656 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Black Robin on Rangatira Island.jpg|thumb|Chatham Island Black Robin on Rangatira Island, New Zealand.]]
Human mediated recovery of species can unintentionally promote maladaptive behaviors in wild populations. In 1980 the number of wild Chatham Island Black Robins was reduced to a single mating pair. Intense management of populations helped the population recover and by 1998 there were 200 individuals. During recovery scientists observed "rim laying" an egg laying habit where individuals laid eggs on the rim of the nest instead of the center. Rim laid eggs never hatched. To combat this land managers pushed the egg to the center of the nest, which greatly increased reproduction. However, by allowing this maladaptive trait to persist, over half the population were now rim layers. Genetic studies found that this was an autosomal dominant mendelian trait that was selected for due to human intervention&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Massaro|first=Melanie|last2=Sainudiin|first2=Raazesh|last3=Merton|first3=Don|last4=Briskie|first4=James V.|last5=Poole|first5=Anthony M.|last6=Hale|first6=Marie L.|date=2013-12-09|title=Human-Assisted Spread of a Maladaptive Behavior in a Critically Endangered Bird|journal=PLOS One|language=en|volume=8|issue=12|pages=e79066|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0079066|pmid=24348992|pmc=3857173|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Successes==
[[File:Cheetah at De Wildt Cheetah Farm, Hartbeespoort, North West Province (6253206366).jpg|thumb|A cheetah at the De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre.]]
The [[De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre]], established in [[South Africa]] in 1971, has a [[cheetah]] captive breeding program. Between 1975 and 2005, 242 litters were born with a total of 785 cubs. The [[survival rate]] of cubs was 71.3% for the first twelve months and 66.2% for older cubs, validating the fact that cheetahs can be bred successfully (and their [[endangerment]] decreased). It also indicated that failure in other breeding habitats may be due to "poor" sperm [[morphology (biology)|morphology]].&lt;ref name=RDA08/&gt;

Wild [[Tasmanian devil]]s have declined by 90% due to a [[Transmissible cancers|transmissible cancer]] called [[Devil Facial Tumor Disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://discovermagazine.com/2014/may/13-the-immortal-devil|title = Fatal Cancer Threatens Tasmanian Devil Populations|last = Rehmeyer|first = Julie|date = March 31, 2014|work = [[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A captive insurance population program has started, but the captive breeding rates at the moment are lower than they need to be. Keeley, Fanson, Masters, and McGreevy (2012) sought to "increase our understanding of the [[estrous cycle]] of the devil and elucidate potential causes of failed male-female pairings" by examining temporal patterns of fecal [[progestogen]] and [[corticosterone]] [[metabolite]] concentrations. They found that the majority of unsuccessful females were captive-born, suggesting that if the species' survival depended solely on captive breeding, the population would probably disappear.&lt;ref name=keeley2012/&gt;

In 2010, the [[Oregon Zoo]] found that [[Columbia Basin pygmy rabbit]] pairings based on familiarity and preferences resulted in a significant increase in breeding success.&lt;ref name=oz130214/&gt;

== Methods Used in Captive Breeding ==
{{See also|Artificial_insemination#In_animals}}
[[File:Californian Condor 50 MC.jpg|thumb|Every known individual of the California condor population has been captured and then bred using research from microsatellite regions in their genome.]]
To found a captive breeding population with adequate [[genetic diversity]], breeders usually select individuals from different source populations—ideally, at least 20-30 individuals. Founding populations for captive breeding programs have often had fewer individuals than ideal because of their threatened state, leaving them more susceptible to challenges such as inbreeding depression.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

To overcome challenges of captive breeding such as adaptive differences, loss of genetic diversity, inbreeding depression, and outbreeding depression and get desired results, captive breeding programs use many monitoring methods. [[Artificial insemination]] is used to produce the desired offspring from individuals who don't mate naturally to reduce effects of mating closely related individuals such as inbreeding.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Conservation Genetics . Cambridge University Press. Kindle Edition.|last=Frankham|first=Richard|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-87847-0|location=United Kingdom|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods as seen in [[panda pornography]] allow programs to mate chosen individuals by encouraging mating behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/22/AR2006112202039.html|title=Pandas Getting New View of Mating Ritual|last=Gray|first=Denis D.|date=2006-11-23|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a concern in captive breeding is to minimize the effects of breeding closely related individuals, [[microsatellite]] regions from an organisms genome can be used to determine amounts of relationship among founders to minimize relatedness and pick the most distant individuals to breed.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; This method has successfully been used in the captive breeding of the [[California condor]] and the [[Guam rail]]. The maximum avoidance of inbreeding (MAI) scheme allows control at a group level rather than an individual level by rotating individuals between groups to avoid inbreeding.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

==New technologies==

=== Assisted reproduction technology (ART): Artificial insemination ===

Getting captive wild animals to breed naturally can be a difficult task. Giant panda for example lose interest in [[mating]] once they are captured, and female giant pandas only experience estrus once a year, which only lasts for 48 to 72 hours&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zoonooz.sandiegozoo.org/2015/03/11/giant-panda-undergoes-artificial-insemination-procedure-at-the-san-diego-zoo|title=Giant Panda Undergoes Artificial Insemination Procedure at the Sand Diego Zoo|last=|first=|date=2015-03-11|website=Zoonooz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many researchers have turned to artificial insemination in an attempt to increase the populations of endangered animals. It may be used for many reasons, including to overcome physical breeding difficulties, to allow a male to inseminate a much larger number of females, to control the paternity of offspring, and to avoid injury incurred during natural mating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.equine-reproduction.com/articles/insemination.htm|title=Artificial Insemination of the Mare|last=|first=|date=|website=Equine Artificial Insemination|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also creates more genetically diverse captive populations, enabling captive facilities to easily share genetic material with each other without the need to move animals. Scientist of the Justus-Liebig-University of Giessen, Germany, from the working group of Michael Lierz, developed a novel technique for semen collection and artificial insemination in parrots producing the world's first macaw by assisted reproduction&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.realclearscience.com/journal_club/2013/06/25/finally_a_way_to_collect_semen_from_parrots_106573.html|title=Finally: A Way to Collect Semen from Parrots|last=Pomeroy|first=Ross|date=June 24, 2013|website=Real Clear Science|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cryopreservation ===

Animal species can be preserved in [[Genebank|gene banks]], which consist of [[cryogenic|a cryogenic]] facilities used to store live [[Spermatozoon|sperm]], [[Ovum|eggs]], or [[embryo]]s in ultracold conditions. The Zoological Society of San Diego has established a "[[frozen zoo]]" to store frozen tissue from the world's rarest and most endangered species samples using [[cryopreservation]] techniques. At present, there has been more than 355 species, including mammals, reptiles, and birds.[[Cryopreservation]] can be performed as [[oocyte cryopreservation]] before fertilization, or as [[embryo cryopreservation]] after fertilization. Cryogenically preserved specimens can potentially be used to revive breeds that are [[Endangered species|endangered]] o r[[Extinction|extinct]], for breed improvement, crossbreeding, research and development. This method can be used for virtually indefinite storage of material without deterioration over a much greater time-period relative to all other methods of ex situ conservation. However, cryo-conservation can be an expensive strategy and requires long term hygienic and economic commitment for germplasms to remain viable. Cryo-conservation can also face unique challenges based on the species, as some species have a reduced survival rate of frozen germplasm,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm|title=Cryoconservation of Animal Genetic Resources|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but cryobiology is a field of active research and many studies concerning plants are underway.

An example of the use of cryoconservation to prevent the extinction of a livestock breed is the case of the [[Hungarian Grey cattle]], or Magya Szurke. Hungarian Grey cattle were once a dominant breed in southeastern Europe with a population of 4.9 million head in 1884. They were mainly used for draft power and meat. However, the population had decreased to 280,000 head by the end of [[World War II]] and eventually reached the low population of 187 females and 6 males from 1965 to 1970.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12581284|title=Economic and ecological importance of indigenous livestock and the application of assisted reproduction to their preservation| vauthors = Solti L, Crichton EG, Loskutoff N, Cseh S | date = 2000-02-01|volume=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The breed's decreased use was due primarily to the [[Mechanised agriculture|mechanization of agriculture]] and the adoption of major breeds, which yield higher milk production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wwf.hu/en/hungarian-grey-cattle|title=WWF|website=wwf.hu|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian government launched a project to preserve the breed, as it possesses valuable traits, such as stamina, calving ease, disease resistance, and easy adaptation to a variety of climates. The government program included various conservation strategies, including the cryopreservation of semen and embryos.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Hungarian government's conservation effort brought the population up to 10,310 in 2012, which shows significant improvement using cryoconservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/dad-is/en/|title=Domestic Animal Diversity Information System (DAD-IS) {{!}} Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|website=www.fao.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cloning ===

The best current cloning techniques have an average success rate of 9.4 percent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ono T, Li C, Mizutani E, Terashita Y, Yamagata K, Wakayama T | title = Inhibition of class IIb histone deacetylase significantly improves cloning efficiency in mice | journal = Biology of Reproduction | volume = 83 | issue = 6 | pages = 929–37 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20686182 | doi = 10.1095/biolreprod.110.085282 | url = https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article/83/6/929/2530195 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when working with familiar species such as mice, while cloning wild animals is usually less than 1 percent successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cloning-endangered-animals/|title=Will Cloning Ever Save Endangered Animals?|last=Jabr|first=Ferris|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, a cow named Bessie gave birth to a cloned Asian [[gaur]], an endangered species, but the calf died after two days. In 2003, a [[banteng]] was successfully cloned, followed by three African wildcats from a thawed frozen embryo. These successes provided hope that similar techniques (using surrogate mothers of another species) might be used to clone extinct species. Anticipating this possibility, tissue samples from the last bucardo ([[Pyrenean ibex]]) were frozen in [[liquid nitrogen]] immediately after it died in 2000. Researchers are also considering cloning endangered species such as the giant panda and cheetah. However, cloning of animals is opposed by animal-groups due to the number of cloned animals that suffer from malformations before they die.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1333206/Clone-farming-introduce-cruelty-massive-scale-say-animal-welfare-groups.html|title=Clone farming would introduce cruelty on a massive scale, say animal welfare groups|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interspecific pregnancy ===

A potential technique for aiding in reproduction of endangered species is [[interspecific pregnancy]], implanting embryos of an endangered species into the womb of a female of a related species, carrying it to term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Niasari-Naslaji A, Nikjou D, Skidmore JA, Moghiseh A, Mostafaey M, Razavi K, Moosavi-Movahedi AA |date=2009-01-29|title=Interspecies embryo transfer in camelids: the birth of the first Bactrian camel calves (Camelus bactrianus) from dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius)|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/rd/RD08140|journal=Reproduction, Fertility and Development|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|pages=333–337|doi=10.1071/RD08140|issn=1448-5990}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used for the Spanish Ibex&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02900547 |title=Advances in interspecific pregnancy |journal=Chinese Science Bulletin |volume=46 |issue=21 |pages=1772–8 |year=2001 |last1=Wang |first1=Xichao |last2=Dai |first2=Bojie |last3=Duan |first3=Enkui |last4=Chen |first4=Dayuan }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Houbara bustard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wernery U, Liu C, Baskar V, Guerineche Z, Khazanehdari KA, Saleem S, Kinne J, Wernery R, Griffin DK, Chang IK | title = Primordial germ cell-mediated chimera technology produces viable pure-line Houbara bustard offspring: potential for repopulating an endangered species | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 12 | pages = e15824 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21209914 | pmc = 3012116 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0015824 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethical Considerations ==
With successes such as in 1986 when a population only of 18 black ferrets left in the world was brought back up to 500 in the wild, and when the Arabian oryx was brought back from extinction in 1972 to a population of 1,000 in the deserts of the Middle East, captive breeding programs have proven successful throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://psmag.com/environment/is-breeding-endangered-species-in-captivity-the-right-way-to-go|title=Is Breeding Endangered Species in Captivity the Right Way to Go?|work=Pacific Standard|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While captive breeding sounds like an ideal solution for preventing endangered animals from facing serious threats of extinction there are still reasons to believe that these programs can occasionally do more harm than good. Some detrimental effects include delays in understanding optimal conditions required for reproduction, failure to reach self-sustaining levels or provide sufficient stock for release, loss of genetic diversity due to inbreeding, and poor success in reintroductions despite available captive-bred young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1365-2664.12449 |title=Ark or park: The need to predict relative effectiveness ofex situandin situconservation before attempting captive breeding |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=841–50 |year=2015 |last1=Dolman |first1=Paul M |last2=Collar |first2=Nigel J |last3=Scotland |first3=Keith M |last4=Burnside |first4=Robert. J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it has been proven that captive breeding programs have yielded negative genetic effects in decreasing the fitness of captive-bred organisms, there is no direct evidence to show that this negative effect also decreases the overall fitness of their wild-born descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.0315 |pmid=19515651 |pmc=2781957 |title=Carry-over effect of captive breeding reduces reproductive fitness of wild-born descendants in the wild |journal=Biology Letters |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=621–4 |year=2009 |last1=Araki |first1=H |last2=Cooper |first2=B |last3=Blouin |first3=M. S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is reason to demand for the release of animals from captivity programs for four main reasons: a lack of sufficient space due to overly successful breeding programs, closure of facilities due to financial reasons, pressure from animal rights advocacy groups, and to aid the conservation of endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waples|first=Kelly A.|last2=Stagoll|first2=Clifford S. | name-list-format = vanc |date=1997|title=Ethical Issues in the Release of Animals from Captivity|journal=BioScience|volume=47|issue=2|pages=115–121|doi=10.2307/1313022|jstor=1313022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there are many ethical complications to reintroducing animals born in captivity back into the wild. For example, when scientists were reintroducing a rare species of toad back into the Mallorcan wild in 1993, a potentially deadly fungus that could kill frogs and toads was unintentionally introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/09/080922122427.htm|title=Captive Breeding Introduced Infectious Disease To Mallorcan Amphibians|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important to maintain the organism’s original habitat, or replicate that specific habitat for species survival.

'''[[Resonator|Cavity]] [[perturbation theory]]''' 
describes methods for derivation of [[perturbation theory|perturbation]] [[formula]]e for performance changes of a cavity resonator. These performance changes are assumed to be caused by either introduction of a small foreign object into the cavity or a small deformation of its boundary.

==General theory==

When a resonant cavity is perturbed, e.g. by introducing a foreign object with distinct material properties into the cavity or when the shape of the cavity is changed slightly, [[electromagnetic fields]] inside the cavity change accordingly. The underlying assumption of cavity perturbation theory is that electromagnetic fields inside the cavity after the change differ by a very small amount from the fields before the change. Then [[Maxwell's equations]] for original and perturbed cavities can be used to derive expressions for the resulting resonant frequency shift.

Cavity perturbation theory generally relies on formulae that consider stored energy. The following description is based on these formulae. This is intuitive since common sense dictates that the maximum change in resonant frequency occurs when the small perturbation is placed at the intensity maximum of the cavity mode. This intuition is valid for high-Q cavities only and when predicting the spectral shift of the resonance frequency. However, the shift is always accompanied by a broadening of the resonance width, i.e. a decrease of Q, which is also important to predict. The classical formulae based on energy considerations, i.e. on |'''E'''.'''E'''| products, cannot predict the broadening. For low-Q cavities, such as plasmonic resonators, they can predict neither the shift, nor the broadening. Correct formulae that are accurate for high- and low-Q resonators and for the shift and the broadening, have been established in 2015, see Nano Lett. 15 (5), pp 3439–3444 (2015). They are as simple, but use '''E'''.'''E''' products instead of |'''E'''.'''E'''| products. Importantly, the phase of the resonant mode is preserved in the new formulae.

==Material perturbation==

[[File:Electromagnetic cavity perturbation.svg|thumb|center|upright=3|Cavity material perturbation]]

When a material within a cavity is changed ([[permittivity]] and/or [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]]), a corresponding change in resonant frequency can be approximated as:&lt;ref&gt;David Pozar, Microwave Engineering, 2nd edition, Wiley, New York, NY, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\omega - \omega_0}{\omega_0}\thickapprox -\frac{\iiint_{V}(\Delta\mu |H_0|^2+\Delta\epsilon |E_0|^2)dv}{\iiint_{V}(\mu |H_0|^2+\epsilon |E_0|^2)dv}\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency|angular]] [[resonant frequency]] of the perturbed cavity, &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; is the resonant frequency of the original cavity, &lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; represent original [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]] respectively, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; are original [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] and [[permittivity]] respectively, while &lt;math&gt;\Delta\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; are changes in original permeability and [[permittivity]] introduced by material change.

Expression ({{EquationNote|1}}) can be rewritten in terms of [[Energy density|stored energies]] as:&lt;ref&gt;Mathew, K. T. 2005. Perturbation Theory. Encyclopedia of RF and Microwave Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\omega - \omega_0}{\omega_0}\thickapprox -\frac{1}{W}\iiint_{V}(\frac{\Delta\epsilon}{\epsilon}\cdot\bar{w_e}+\frac{\Delta\mu}{\mu}\cdot\bar{w_m})dv\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

where W is the total energy stored in the original cavity and &lt;math&gt;\bar{w_e}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{w_m}&lt;/math&gt; are [[Electric potential energy|electric]] and [[Energy density#Energy density of electric and magnetic fields|magnetic energy]] densities respectively.

==Shape perturbation==

[[File:Electromagnetic shape perturbation.svg|thumb|center|upright=3|Cavity shape perturbation]]

When a general shape of a resonant cavity is changed, a corresponding change in resonant frequency can be approximated as:&lt;ref&gt;David Pozar, Microwave Engineering, 2nd edition, Wiley, New York, NY, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\omega - \omega_0}{\omega_0}\thickapprox \frac{\iiint_{\Delta V}(\mu |H_0|^2-\epsilon |E_0|^2)dv}{\iiint_{V}(\mu |H_0|^2+\epsilon |E_0|^2)dv}\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

Expression ({{EquationNote|3}}) for change in resonant frequency can additionally be written in terms of time-average stored energies as:&lt;ref&gt;David Pozar, Microwave Engineering, 2nd edition, Wiley, New York, NY, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\omega - \omega_0}{\omega_0}\thickapprox \frac{\Delta W_m - \Delta W_e}{W_m + W_e}\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta W_m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta W_e&lt;/math&gt; represent time-average [[electric]] and [[magnetic]] energies contained in &lt;math&gt;\Delta V&lt;/math&gt;.

This expression can also be written in terms of energy densities &lt;ref&gt;Mathew, K. T. 2005. Perturbation Theory. Encyclopedia of RF and Microwave Engineering&lt;/ref&gt; as:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\omega - \omega_0}{\omega_0}\thickapprox \frac{(\bar{w_m}-\bar{w_e})\cdot\Delta V}{W}\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

==Applications==

Microwave measurement techniques based on cavity perturbation theory are generally used to determine the dielectric and magnetic parameters of materials and various circuit components such as [[dielectric resonator]]s. Since ex-ante knowledge of the resonant frequency, resonant frequency shift and [[electromagnetic field]]s is necessary in order to extrapolate material properties, these measurement techniques generally make use of standard resonant cavities where resonant frequencies and electromagnetic fields are well known. Two examples of such standard resonant cavities are rectangular and circular [[waveguide]] cavities and [[coaxial cable]]s resonators . Cavity perturbation measurement techniques for material characterization are used in many fields ranging from physics and material science to medicine and biology.&lt;ref&gt;Vyas, A.D.; Rana, V.A.; Gadani, D.H.; Prajapati, A.N.; "Cavity perturbation technique for complex permittivity measurement of dielectric materials at X-band microwave frequency," Recent Advances in Microwave Theory and Applications, 2008.

Yelon; "Measurement of Complex Permeability of Ferromagnetic Nanowires using Cavity Perturbation Techniques," Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2006. CCECE '06.

==Examples==

=== &lt;math&gt; TE_{10n} &lt;/math&gt; rectangular waveguide cavity ===

[[Image:Material cavity.JPG|thumb|center|upright=3|alt=A rectangular waveguide cavity with material sample.|Material sample introduced into rectangular waveguide cavity.]]

For rectangular waveguide cavity, field distribution of dominant [[Waveguide (electromagnetism)#Analysis|&lt;math&gt; TE_{10n} &lt;/math&gt;]] mode is well known. Ideally, the material to be measured is introduced into the cavity at the position of maximum electric or magnetic field.  When the material is introduced at the position of maximum electric field, then the contribution of magnetic field to perturbed frequency shift is very small and can be ignored. In this case, we can use perturbation theory to derive expressions for real and imaginary components of complex material [[permittivity]] &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_r = \epsilon_r'+j\epsilon_r''&lt;/math&gt; as:&lt;ref&gt;Mathew, K. T. 2005. Perturbation Theory. Encyclopedia of RF and Microwave Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_r'-1=\frac{f_c-f_s}{2f_s}\frac{V_c}{V_s}\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_r''=\frac{V_c}{4V_s}\frac{Q_c-Q_s}{Q_cQ_s}\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt; represent resonant frequencies of original cavity and perturbed cavity respectively, &lt;math&gt;V_c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_s&lt;/math&gt; represent volumes of original cavity and material sample respectively, &lt;math&gt;Q_c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q_s&lt;/math&gt; represent [[Q factor|quality factors]] of original and perturbed cavities respectively.

Once the complex permittivity of the material is known, we can easily calculate its effective [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]] &lt;math&gt; \sigma_e &lt;/math&gt; and [[dielectric]] [[loss tangent]] &lt;math&gt;\tan\delta&lt;/math&gt; as:&lt;ref&gt;Mathew, K. T. 2005. Perturbation Theory. Encyclopedia of RF and Microwave Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sigma_e=\omega\epsilon''=2\pi f\epsilon_0\epsilon_r''\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;tan \delta=\frac{\epsilon_r''}{\epsilon_r'}\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|8}}}}

where f is the frequency of interest and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the free space permittivity.

Similarly, if the material is introduced into the cavity at the position of maximum magnetic field, then the contribution of electric field to perturbed frequency shift is very small and can be ignored. In this case, we can use perturbation theory to derive expressions for complex material [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] &lt;math&gt;\mu_r = \mu_r'+j\mu_r''&lt;/math&gt; as:&lt;ref&gt;Mathew, K. T. 2005. Perturbation Theory. Encyclopedia of RF and Microwave Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mu_r'-1=(\frac{\lambda_g^2+4a^2}{8a^2})(\frac{f_c-f_s}{f_s})(\frac{V_c}{V_s})\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|9}}}}

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mu_r''=(\frac{\lambda_g^2+4a^2}{16a^2})(\frac{V_c}{V_s})(\frac{Q_c-Q_s}{Q_cQ_s})\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|10}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_g&lt;/math&gt; is the guide wavelength (calculated as &lt;math&gt;\lambda_g=\frac{2l}{n}&lt;/math&gt;).

'''''Common Arrangement of Work Sections''''', first published in 1987, is a [[construction]] industry working convention designed to promote standardisation of, and detailed coordination between, bills of quantities and specifications. It is part of an industry-wide coordinated projects information initiative (now managed by the [[Construction Project Information Committee]]) and has been used for the arrangement of the [[National Building Specification]], the ''National Engineering Specification and the Standard Method of Building Works'' (7th ed).

The new edition aligns CAWS with the Unified Classification for the Construction Industry ([[Uniclass]]) which was published in 1997.

The Common Arrangement is the authoritative UK classification of work sections for building work, for use in arranging project specifications and bills of quantities. Over 300 work sections are defined in detail to give:

* good coordination between drawings, specifications and bills of quantities
* predictability of location of relevant information
* fewer oversights and discrepancies between documents
* flexibility to the contractor in dividing the project information into work packages.

The classification of work sections is separate from, and complementary to, the classification of other concepts such as building types, elements, construction products and properties/characteristics. Uniclass, published in 1997, is the definitive overall classification tables, one of which is for work sections for buildings, comprising the Common Arrangement group, sub-group and work section headings.

The '''Comoé National Park Research Station''', located in the [[Comoé National Park]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], was founded by Professor Karl Eduard Linsenmair in 1989/90.

The research station was forced to close after the outbreak of the [[First Ivorian Civil War]] in 2002. After the end of the [[Second Ivorian Civil War]] in 2011 repairs at the station began and in 2014 the station had achieved again its full working capacity. The focus of the field based research is on conservation, tropical ecology and behaviour.

==History==
In 1989/90 a first research camp was realized with substantial funding provided by the Volkswagen Stiftung, the [[University of Würzburg]] and the respective Ministry (Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Bildung und Kultus, Wissenschaft und Kunst). A successful application for a research grant by Linsenmair at the [[Fritz Thyssen Foundation]] led to the expansion and transformation into a permanent station, after various bureaucratic hurdles in [[Germany]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire]], which delayed the construction of the field station approximately 8 years.&lt;ref name="Die Zeit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Habekuss|first1=Fritz|title=Der Patron und sein Paradies|url=http://www.zeit.de/2015/11/elfenbeinkueste-comoe-nationalpark-forschungsstation-savanne|accessdate=29 July 2015|work=Die Zeit|issue=N°11/2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Construction started in 2000 and in early 2002 all guesthouses and other buildings apart from the lab were finished and a move from the camp to the new station was possible.

The outbreak of the [[First Ivorian Civil War]], in September 2002, resulted in the loss of the entire removable and demountable equipment and the closure of the station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Degen|first1=Marieke|title=Civil war leaves Ivory Coast research in tatters|journal=Nature|date=13 February 2003|volume=421|issue=6924|pages=680–680|doi=10.1038/421680b|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6924/full/421680b.html|accessdate=29 July 2015|pmid=12610586}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the positive development in the country after the [[Second Ivorian Civil War]], the rehabilitation of the station started in 2012 with remaining funds from the Fritz Thyssen Foundation and the University of Würzburg. With the construction of the solar plant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coskun|first1=Ayhan|title=36 kWP for Research Station in Ivory Coast|url=http://www.solar23.com/news1.html|website=SOLAR23|publisher=SOLAR23|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in December 2014, the rehabilitation was finished and the station had achieved its full working capacity again,&lt;ref name="Die Zeit"/&gt; making it one of the most modern field research stations in Africa.&lt;ref name="afrika"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frank|first1=Erik|title=Research Station Comoé|url=http://www.afrikazentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/forschung_in_afrika/research_station_comoe/|website=University of Würzburg|publisher=Afrikazentrum|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ziels|first1=Susanne|last2=Linsenmair|first2=Karl Eduard|title=Comoé Research Station|journal=GTÖ Conference 2015|date=7 April 2015|page=Free Session 12-P11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Homepage"/&gt;

==Research==
The Research of the station focuses on various fields of conservation, tropical ecology and behaviour, e.g. ecophysiology, chemical and evolutionary  ecology. In its first 2 decades before the civil war over 20 international research institutions conducted projects at the station with over 100 scientists contributing to the over 200 papers published in peer reviewed journals. Far more students participated in field courses, collecting data for more than 40 diploma, masters, bachelors and Ph.D. theses.&lt;ref name="uni"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Linsenmair|first1=Eduard|title=Tropenforscher kehren zurück|url=http://www.biologie.uni-wuerzburg.de/aktuelles_veranstaltungen/archiv1/single/artikel/tropenfors-1/|website=University of Würzburg|publisher=einBLICK|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Croatian Pre-Romanesque art and architecture''' or '''Old Croatian Art''' is [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture]] [[Art of Croatia|of Croats]] from their arrival at [[Balkans]] till the end of the 11th century when begins the dominance of [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] style in art; that was the time of Croatian rulers ([[Dukes of Croatia|Croatian dukes]] and [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Croatian Kingdom]]).

==Historical background==
{{main|Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)}}
[[File:Dolazak Hrvata Celestin Medović.JPG|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;[[Celestin Medović]], ''[[Arrival of Croats]]'', before 1920, [[Croatian History Institute]], [[Zagreb]].]]
[[Croats]] have moved from northern Europe, together with other Slavs and Avars, to the area of former Roman provinces of Pannonia, Dalmatia and Istria, where they live til the present day. There they founded several [[principality|principalities]]: [[Duchy of Pannonian Croatia|Pannonian Croatia]] in the north around the river [[Sava]], and [[Dalmatian Croatia]] along the western and southern [[Adriatic]] coast. Together they were known as [[White Croatia]], while to the east there were [[medieval principalities in southern Dalmatia]] which were at times collectively called [[Red Croatia]].

Croats have been developed to the stage of Iron Age, and they didn’t know how to enjoy the riches of Roman cities, so they inhabited not the city itself but its suburbs (like the river island on the delta of river Jadro next to city of Salona). Croats have assimilated Avars, accepted Christianity, and the ruling cast learned to speak and write Latin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?ID=23089 Art of Early Medieval Croatia at culturenet.hr]&lt;/ref&gt; Croats have accepted Christianity from Franks to the west and from Byzantium from the east. Most of the principalities have turned to Christianity in the 9th century except Pagania which was true to old Slav mythology until the 13th century.

[[File:Branimir.jpg|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;[[Croatian interlace]] with the inscription of [[duke Branimir]]’s name from year 880.]]
First Croatian ruler that was recognized by the [[pope]] was [[duke Branimir]], who was called by pope [[Pope John VIII|John VIII]] ''dux Chroatorum'' in his letter in 879.
First king of [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Kingdom of Croatia]], [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]] from the [[House of Trpimirović]] was crowned around year 925 as ''rex Chroatorum'' and he united Pannonian Principality and Littoral Croatian Duchy into respectable medieval country  which peaked during the reign of [[Peter Krešimir IV of Croatia|Petar Krešimir IV]] (1058-1074).

During the time of Croatian rulers the country was rarely ruled from one place and royal court would move from town to town in which there was a royal castle. The most important royal cities were [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]], [[Biograd na Moru]] and [[Knin]]. Other bigger cities were [[Zadar]], [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Krk]], [[Osor, Croatia|Osor]], Trogir, Ston and Dubrovnik, in which big number of original Roman population resided that was eventually croaticized.

After the death of last ruler from the dynasty of Trpimirović in 1091 most of Croatian nobility has accepted the [[Hungarian Kingdom|Hungarian]] king [[Coloman]] as a king of unified kingdom of Croatian and [[Hungary]], stated by the deal ''[[Pacta conventa (Croatia)|Pacta Conventa]]'' from year 1102. In Hungarian Kingdom, in Croatia all art already has all characteristics of Romanesque style.

==Old Croatian architecture==

[[File:Zadar Sankt Donat 04.jpg|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;[[Church of St. Donatus]] from the 9th century in Zadar]]
During 7th and 8th century in Croatia there is a trend of building smaller buildings from the material and decorative elements of ruined older Roman buildings. During the 9th century, parallel with the establishment of Croatian principalities, new architecture of pre-Romanesque characteristics emerged. It was based on numerous influences of which the Frankish and Byzantine were the strongest. Slowly these inherited influences were degrading in favour of original architectural forms.

[[File:Crkva sv. trojice.jpg|thumb|150px|left|&lt;center&gt;[[Church of Three Saints]] in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] (9th-11th century)]]
From this time, there are dozens of large ones and over a hundred small churches preserved across entire Croatian coastline and islands. They are all built out of roughly broken stones covered with thick layer of moulter inside and out, and with narrow decorative niches with arched top (like church of st. Peter in Priko near [[Omiš]] and St. Michael near Ston). Also, they often have stone [[Vault (architecture)|vault]]s, [[apse]]s and [[dome]]s, as well as stone furniture (frames of doors and windows, perforated stone windows, and altar fences) columns, beams and portals. Instead of classical Roman forms where every part of the building was articulated and had its own recognizable form, new pre-Romanesque buildings have those parts united in unified mass. Therefore, the point where the wall turns to vault, or to drum of the dome is almost unnoticeable. Even though they were built roughly with unsophisticated materials they have excellent and often perfect understanding of architectural space.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?ID=23089 Radovan Ivančević from Culturenet.hr]&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller churches are called “churches of free shapes”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vucafe.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=7517 Ljubo Karaman, Old Croatian Art (Hr)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728165026/http://www.vucafe.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=7517 |date=2011-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as which the medieval architects wanted to explore all possibilities of shaping on the circular and rectangular base. Cube churches with dome are a bit simple (St. Pelegrin, Dugi otok), rectangular with elliptical base are a bit more complex (St. George, Ravanjska), as well as single nave churches with dome above middle section (St. Peter in Omiš) and cube based churches elongated with two apses (Church of St. Donatus on Krk) and the most complicated ones are those based on Greek cross with dome on the centre and large apse in eastern wing and two smaller apses in northern and southern wing ([[Church of Saint Cross]] in Nin).&lt;ref name="culturenet1"&gt;[http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?ID=23089 Culturenet.hr]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Church of St. Mihailo.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;The Church of St. Michael in [[Ston]] from 1080, a foundation of [[Duklja|Doclea]] king [[Mihailo Voislav]].]] --&gt;
[[File:Crikva sveti Dunat 1.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Church of St. Donatus on the island of [[Krk]].]]
The most original churches are churches based on a circle with multiple apses that are spread around in radial rhythm. [[Church of St. Three]] in Split has radial 6 apses, while Church in Ošlje (Ston) is the ony one with 8 apses. The biggest church with circular base is ''[[Church of St. Donatus]]'' in Zadar from the 9th century. Around its circular base that has a dome there is a ring nave with gallery and three apses on the east. From that time in central Europe there is only Charlemagne’s ''[[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]]'' that can be compared with its size and beauty.

Large churches often have one or three naves, like ''[[St. Saviour, Cetina]]'' from the 9th century which has rounded [[buttress]]es and a [[bell tower]] above the western portal ([[westwork]]).

In the 10th century Croatian queen [[Jelena of Zadar]], the wife of king [[Mihajlo Krešimir II]], built in [[Solin, Croatia|Solin]] two churches: [[Church of St. Stephen of the Island]] which was used as a royal mausoleum, and [[Church of Our Lady of the Island]], one of the biggest in Croatia which was used as crown [[basilica]]. Church of St. Stephen was built in Carolingian style with entrance hall above which was a gallery surrounded with two towers (westwork) from each sides of a [[narthex]]&lt;ref&gt;In its ruins was found famous sepulchral tablet of queen Jelena († 976) in which was stated that she was "widow of king Michael, mother of Stephan the king". http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?ID=23089&lt;/ref&gt; which led to tree nave church with two rows of pillars and a square apse at the end of central nave.

In the 11th century, next to older “Church on the Hill” in Solin, [[Crown church of St. Peter and Moses]] (better known as “[[Hollow church]]“) was built. The church was of unified Croatian pre-Romanesque forms and those Romanesque that appeared with the arrival of Benedictine monks in these parts. It has three naves, many thin niches inside and three apses of which middle is square and other are semicircular from inside and square outside. In this church the legate of Pope Gregory VII has crowned Croatian [[Dmitar Zvonimir]].

In northern Croatia there are only few fragments of interlace found in [[Sisak]], the capital of [[Ljudevit Posavski]]. When the bishopric was founded in [[Zagreb]] (1090), Croatian culture at the coast has already flourished for 300 years and Croatia was at the end of its independence.

==Sculptural ornaments==

[[File:10cent pleter Drzislav.jpg|thumb|250px|left|&lt;center&gt;[[Croatian interlace]] with inscription of king [[Stjepan Držislav]] from the 10th century.]][[File:Bascanska ploca.jpg|mini|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;[[Baška tablet]], the most famous glagolitic monument written with transversal type of glagolitic script from the 11th century.]]

Pre-Romanesque Croatian churches are also the most important historical sources of that time because on their beams and tympanums of altar fences, as well on some portals and ciboriums we found many names of Croatian kings, dukes and nobleman which are mentioned as patrons and builders of those churches. The oldest one is from church in Rižinice (Solin) which mentions Croatian duke [[Trpimir]] (''PRO DVCE TREPIMERO''), from around year 850, while on the inscription of [[duke Branimir]] from year 888 we have the oldest mention of Croats: ''CRVATORVM''. On the rest from 10th century we found the names of dukes [[Muncimir of Croatia]], [[Držislav]] and [[Svetislav]], all the way to [[king Zvonimir]] from the end of the 11th century.
That inscription of king Zvonimir is already made in [[Croatian language]], written in [[Glagolitic script]] ([[Baška tablet]]).

Double literacy and two scripts have been noticed in several monuments as [[Plomin tablet]] (Istria) and [[Valun tablet]] ([[Cres]], 11th century) where we have Latin language and script as well as Croatian translation in Glagolitic script. Nevertheless, soon the Latin script replaced the Glagolitic which was the only way that Croats would be accepted into still Romanized Medieval Europe. However, Croats will use their native language and script all the way to the 16th century, especially in Istria, Kvarner and on the Croatian coast.&lt;ref name="culturenet1"/&gt;

[[File:Reljef splitska krstionica.jpg|thumb|left|150px|&lt;center&gt;Baptistery with figure of Croatian king from the 11th century; now in the [[Split Cathedral]].]][[File:Plomin tablet 1.jpg|thumb|150px|&lt;center&gt;[[Plomin tablet]]]]
Altar fences and stone perforated windows were decorated with shallow interlace ornament which we call [[Croatian interlace]]. Motifs of this interlace are often of classical origin (waves, three string interlace, pentagrams, nets of rhomboids, etc.), but while in the Roman art it was used only as a frame, here they cover the entire surface. Sheer number, but also the quality of stonework, of these monuments tells us of rich masonry tradition of numerous masters and workshops on the east coast of Adriatic. Comparing to thousands of fragments found in Dalmatia, in the northern Croatia there are only two confirmed founds: one in [[Lobor]] and one in [[Ilok]].&lt;ref&gt;Radovan Ivančević, ''Umjetnost razdoblja život I.'', Profil, Zagreb, 2001, pg. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the interlace is replaced with figures of Gospels (like on the altar fence of Holy Sunday Church in Zadar), but those figures are flatten and their character lines are reduced to graphic lines in outmost linear stylization. The same is the relief from Crown Hollow church of [[king Zvonimir]] in Solin with the figure of ''(Croatian) king'' on the throne with [[Franks|Frankish crown]], beside him is a page, and on the ground is a bowing subject. This relief is from the 15th century a front part of a baptistery in Split Cathedral.

In church of St. Mary from the 11th century in Bishopric (Biskupija) near [[Knin]] the oldest figure of Holy Mary in Croatia was found.&lt;ref&gt;Josip Soldo: History of Church in Croatia, Zagreb-Frankfurt/M., 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-Romanesque painting in Croatia==

Croatian interlace was originally painted, usually every string would be coloured brightly yellow, red or blue. Since the wall paintings that are mentioned in several literal sources (like the portraits of Trpimirović dynasty in church of St. George in Putalj above [[Kaštel Sućurac]]) are not preserved, they are only type of pre-Romanesque Croatian painting.

[[File:Fresco of Mihailo Vojislavljević, njegos.org.jpg|thumb|150px|right|&lt;center&gt;Portrait of [[Mihailo I of Duklja]], the first recognized ruler of Duklja on a fresco in the ''Church of St. Michael'' in ''[[Ston]]''.]]
The only preserved paintings are found in the [[church of St. Michael near Ston]] from the 11th century . They were ordered by [[Duklja|Doclea]]n ruler [[Mihailo Vojislav]], and were a work of local artist who with rough form and primitive materials achieved strong and suggestive expression in portrayed characters. The figure of a king that holds a model of a church has the same crown as the king depicted in the relief in Split baptistery. His portrait is also remarkable, it shows bony person with high eyebrows and wrinkled forehead, while his long hair and beard are already partly gray.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vucafe.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=7517 Ljubo Karaman, Old Croatian Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728165026/http://www.vucafe.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=7517 |date=2011-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fortunately significant number of church [[codex|codices]] were preserved. They were done on pergam with pre-Romanesque [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]]s of high quality and technique. The oldest one is [[Split Breviary]] that was written and painted from the 8th to 11th centuries, based on famous Breviaries from pre-Carolingian era. In [[Zagreb]] there is a [[Liber psalmorum]] which was illuminated in [[Benedictine]] style by [[prior]] Majon for archbishop Paul of Split (c. 1015–1030). In [[Vatican City|Vatican]] there is a Breviary, also in monte-cassino Benedictine style (initials of intertwined leaves, interlace and animal heads) which originates from monastery of St. Nicola in Osor. The same style of illumination we can found in Breviars in [[Trogir]], [[Šibenik]] and [[Dubrovnik]] but there are many that were recorded (like 47 books in only one church in monastery of St. Peter in Seka) but not preserved.

'''Degreasing''', often called '''defatting''' or '''fat trimming''', is the removal of fatty acids from an object. In [[culinary]] science, degreasing is done with the intention of reducing the [[fat]] content of a [[meal]].

==Degreasing food==
Degreasing is often used by [[dieting|diet]]ers, particularly those following low-fat diets to reduce their fat consumption to induce weight loss.  The energy content of 1 g of fat is 9 [[calories]], while that of [[carbohydrates]] and [[proteins]] are 4 calories.  Hence, dieters often view decreasing fat consumption as an efficient way of losing weight without greatly sacrificing total volume of food.  Degreasing during meal preparation is used to reduce the energy content of the food being prepared, and degreasing of a prepared food is also often used in social situations where one may have to consume restaurant food which is rich in fat.

Those people who wish to reduce their cholesterol level or fat intake, in particular people with [[hypercholesterolemia]] often use degreasing to reduce their fat consumption.

=== Degreasing of a meal during preparation ===
Fat trimming of a meal can be done during preparation by a variety of methods.  The most common methods involving substituting food items or removal of naturally occurring fat and conservative addition of fat.

Substituting fats is a method in which a certain ingredient is substituted by another ingredient.  A common way of doing this is substituting saturated [[fatty acids]] with unsaturated fatty acids while cooking.  For instance, olive oil can be used instead of butter for seasoning vegetables.

Food items are also substituted to reduce fat content.  For instance, instead of using eggs by using a whole egg, where the egg yolks are high in fat levels, egg whites can instead be used.  Alternatively, [[skimmed milk]] or similar low-fat products can be used as ingredients for [[cooking]].

===Degreasing liquids===
[[File:Degreasing soup.jpg|thumb|right|260px|(''Frozen soup with a layer of fat shown above'') Cooling provides an easy way to degrease food as the fat rises to the surface and solidifies fully.]]

Many different foods can be degreased after preparation. Liquid foods that are high in fat, such as [[braising]] liquids, [[roasting]] juices and [[broth]]s may have floating oil on top throughout and after the cooking process. Fat can be skimmed off the liquid with a small [[ladle (spoon)|ladle]], spoon, or cup as the liquid [[simmer]]s and then discarded. This is done by placing the saucepan with only half of it on the heat source so that the liquid simmers only on one side. This pushes the fat to the opposite side and makes it easier to lift off with the ladle. The fat can then be skimmed off by holding the ladle so that the top of its bowl is almost level with the liquid and then tilting it slightly and in a circular motion toward the edge of the saucepan where the fat accumulates.&lt;ref name='wiley'&gt;{{Cite book | year=2002 | title = Glorious French Food: A Fresh Approach to the Classics | author1=James Peterson | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | isbn=978-0-471-44276-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWSVpBheCnYC&amp;pg=PT46&amp;dq=degreasing+food | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As braising liquids and broths simmer, they typically throw off more fat and protein and sometimes froth, so it is easier to wait at least a few minutes until the liquid has cooled before degreasing. In making slowly reduced liquids it may be ideal to wait for it to cool even longer.&lt;ref name='wiley' /&gt; 

As an alternative to a ladle, a [[degreasing cup]] can be used to skim the fat off hot liquids. This is a clear plastic or glass cup that looks similar to a [[teapot]], with a spout that comes out of the bottom. The liquid and juices are poured into the cup then poured out leaving the fat behind; the liquid comes from the bottom of the cup instead of the top. Degreasing cups come in various sizes.&lt;ref name='wiley' /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newitalianrecipes.com/cooking-terms.html | title = Cooking Terms | accessdate = 2010-08-04 | publisher = New Italian Recipes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Refrigerating or freezing liquids until the fat congeals and solidifies can make the fat easier to remove with a spoon. If, after removing the congealed fat, the liquid still appears cloudy, it can be made clearer by skimming it again with a ladle after bringing it to a gentle simmer to allow for the release of more fat and insoluble proteins.&lt;ref name='wiley' /&gt;

===Degreasing solid food items===
Some items, such as roasted foods, and other cooked food items, such as pizza, can sometimes be oily and greasy. Degreasing them after preparation may provide a solution to this problem. Fried foods, such as [[French fries]], can often be degreased without decreasing the crispiness of the food item by simply blotting out the oil in the food item with a [[tissue paper]].

==Commercial degreasing==
Many food manufacturing companies such as [[Weight Watchers]] have been developed for people who wish to reduce their fat intake.  The customer need of defatting has also led to the production of low fat products, e.g., low fat cheese.

==Solvent degreasing==
{{Main| Solvent degreasing}}

Solvent degreasing is a process used to prepare a part for further operations such as [[electroplating]] or [[paint]]ing.  Typically it uses [[petroleum]], [[chlorine]], or [[alcohol]] based [[solvent]]s to dissolve the [[machining]] fluids and other contaminants that might be on the part.&lt;ref&gt;Kalpakjian, Serope, Schmid, Steven R. (2006). Manufacturing Engineering and Technology. 5th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall. 1079.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11127">'''Environmental health ethics''' is a field of study that combines environmental health policies and ethical consideration towards a mutually acceptable goal. Given the myriad of environmental issues facing society today a sound ethical background can be applied in an attempt to reach a compromise between conflicting interests, like [[anthropocentrism]], global stewardship, religious values, economic development, and public health. A small sample of the scientific disciplines involved in environmental health ethics include: [[ecology]], [[toxicology]], [[epidemiology]], and [[exposure biology]].

==Environmental health topics==

Environmental health embodies a wide range of topics with which there are many ethical issues. Many of these issues can be traced back to a moral obligation towards to life forms and other units of biological organization, like ecosystems, and the nature of that obligation. Humanity's place within any given ecosystem must be weighed against the importance of regional, and global health of the environment as a whole. Human and animal rights, property use, and other freedoms can be combined with other factors like to form an ethical dilemma [[social justice]], equality, sustainability, and [[globalism]] to form ethical dilemmas. In response to difficulties with using moral theories to resolve ethical dilemmas various approaches can be used. A case-by-case approach may be too slow when considering the volume of issues at present, so an alternative may be better suited to the task. Taking into account commonly accepted moral virtues can guide conduct and address conflicts between values, rules, and obligations. Most, if not all, of these generally held principles can be found in the ethical approaches listed above, an example of which may be 'respect human rights'. This Principle-Based Method for ethical decision making can be viewed below.

# State the question or problem.
# Gather the relevant information.
# Explore different opinions.
# Apply ethical principles to the different options.
# Resolve any conflicts among ethical principles.
# Take action.&lt;ref&gt;Fox and DeMarco 2000; Beauchamp and Childress 2008; Shamoo and Resnik 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

After settling on a methodology for analyzing different ethical situations we can turn to a broad survey of some of the most relevant issues which face humanity today.

==Pest control==
[[Pesticide]]s are used throughout the world in an attempt to control, repel, or kill pest species. Though many species of insect can be commonly identified throughout the world, others may harm human health and well-being while providing a benefit to the overall environment of an area. One example of the phenomenon is a bee's ability to sting an individual who may have a serious allergic reaction, though they also play a crucial role in the pollination of an ecosystem. A further example would be various species of bat, which though they can transmit rabies, also help to control mosquito populations.
 
Perhaps the biggest event in the history of pesticide use is the widespread use of [[DDT]] to control various pests, including mosquitoes and lice. Its long-term effects had not been sufficiently documented and thus it was assumed to be of low toxicity. Over time the widespread use of DDT began to have serious environmental and human health consequences. Organisms further up the food chain showed significant amounts of DDT in their tissues and this presence had adverse health effects, for example, the weakening of predatory bird eggshells and fish kills. Adverse effects among humans included endocrine system disruption which can lead to reproductive complications.

Among the most disruptive pesticides are those dubbed [[Persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs) which do not break down easily in the environment, or if they do they become something equally harmful. Because POPs represent such a threat to organisms within an environment, especially those higher on a food chain, specific international legislation referred to as the Stockholm Convention banned several of them being used. Some of these pollutants are DDT, [[aldrin]], [[chlordane]], [[dieldrin]], [[endrin]], [[heptachlor]], [[hexachlorobenzene]], and [[toxaphene]].&lt;ref&gt;Robson et al. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

With these considerations in place it falls onto lawmakers to regulate responsible use of pesticides, and ethics can provide a starting point to consider the best option. Extensive use of pesticides would improve life in the short-term but be harmful in the long-term, and completely banning their use would likewise be detrimental to overall environmental and human health. One strategy to encourage is called Integrated Pest Management (IPM), in which pesticides are responsibly used to limit agricultural loss but also watched for growing resistance and environmental toxicity. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) have also taken measured to educate clinicians and the public about relevant issues and the best ways to manage pesticide use.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic engineering, food, and nutrition==
[[Genetic engineering]] concerns the application of scientific alteration of plant and animal DNA in order to combat pests, disease, drought, and other factors which can adversely harm the organism. Objections to [[genetically modified organism]]s (GMOs) include theological (playing God) and economic (GMOs can be costly) viewpoints. Genetic engineering of both plants and animals must pass through FDA legislation, which may include public labeling of the product or otherwise marking it as genetically modified.

Food and nutrition also fall under the category of things regulated by the FDA, however, the ethics of this regulation are not always clear. Health consequences of unsafe food, eating in overlarge quantities, are well documented yet in all societies there is no legislation against over-consumption. Ethical properties of utilitarianism and [[social justice]] conflict with humanity's freedom of choice in the determining of access to healthy, safe food.

==Pollution and waste==
Air, water, and solid waste pollution are environmental health issues which can adversely affect people, plants, and animals. From an ethical standpoint many things about pollutants can be studied, like questions of disposal, storage, recycling, and responsibility. A few examples of air pollutants include particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon oxides, [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s, and [[toxic heavy metal|heavy metals]] (e.g. [[mercury (element)|mercury]]). Perhaps the largest ethical debate concerning [[air pollution]] is how to balance economic development against the interests of the [[public health]], safety, and cleanliness. With both sides offering benefits and drawbacks it can be difficult to establish an acceptable compromise. Legislation enacted to prevent widespread use of chlorofluorocarbons, which cause significant environmental damage, can be seen as one instance of economic development taking a lower priority to public health.

Water pollution is another type of widespread contaminant which has ethical implications in mitigating the source and balancing conflicting priorities. The two types of water contaminants are anthropogenic compounds (generally referred to as pollutants, such as disinfection products, metals, municipal and agricultural waste, and petroleum and coal hydrocarbons) and natural contaminants (such as microorganisms or chemicals like arsenic and nitrogen, which are naturally present in the soil). the common misconception is that chemicals leaking into the soil will be diluted over time and rendered harmless. This theory does not take into account persistent organic pollutants, which do not break down easily, and sometimes break down into more harmful constituents. Most industrialized nations have legislation in place to protect the public from impure drinking water. The Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 established maximum levels of pollutants in public drinking water, however its power to regulate private sources of bottled water or wells is severely limited. An additional issue regarding water pollution is the relative scarcity of clean fresh water on the earth, an issue which acutely presents itself in areas prone to drought. Agriculture uses a great deal of water, so much so that shortages in drought-prone areas can significantly affect crop yield. The main ethical issues with water pollution is whether growth should be restricted in order to preserve public health. An additional issue is the regulation of private corporations, whose activities may put populations of citizens at risk for groundwater contamination.

Solid waste pollution includes pollutants like agricultural waste, construction waste, [[electronic waste]], hazardous waste, medical, and mining waste. The two prevailing strategies for solid waste management are prevention and treatment/disposal. Waste prevention is the preferable, both economically and environmentally, as it does not necessitate costly removal and storage. Many of the same ethical issues related above manifest themselves with the handling and storage of solid waste, as well as an additional social justice issue of exactly where the storage area for solid waste should be located.

==Chemical regulation==
[[Chemical regulation]], including carbon particles and nanotubes and nanotechnology, are very new technologies whose long-term effects have not been satisfactorily studied. This lack of research argues that cautionary use of these products is warranted, especially when short-term effects include harmful symptoms. In opposition to this caution is the nanotechnology industry which is growing very rapidly and may be able to alleviate many of the problems facing society today, like selective cancer treatment and the energy crisis. Perhaps the largest obstacle to testing occurs with the sheer diversity of nanoparticles, of which the only unifying factor is their minuscule size.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4322">'''Farmland preservation''' is a joint effort by [[non-governmental organization]]s and [[local government]]s to set aside and protect examples of a region's [[farmland (farming)|farmland]] for the use, education, and enjoyment of future generations. It is often a part of [[regional planning]] and national [[historic preservation]].

==History==
[[New Jersey]] passed the [[Farmland Assessment Act of 1964]] to mitigate the loss of farmland to rapid [[suburbanization|suburban development]] through the use of favorable tax assessments. But by the late 1970s, the value of farmland had outstripped the tax benefits of the act, so the state purchased [[deed]] restrictions on farms through the [[Agriculture Retention and Development Act]] of 1981. 

Regional efforts in [[Monmouth County, New Jersey]] include the [[Navesink Highlands]] [[Greenway (landscape)|Greenway]], a project of the Monmouth County Farmland Preservation Program, which, along with the Monmouth Conservation Foundation, purchased the development rights of the Holly Crest Farm in [[Middletown, New Jersey|Middletown]] in September 2008 for US $2.5 million. Over 20 percent of county farmlands and open spaces are permanently preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Sametta M. Sale Preserves Middletown Farm. "Asbury Park Press," 11 September 2008, B4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American Farmland Trust]] was established in 1980 to preserve farmland and promote sustainable farming practices.

The [[Genesee Valley Conservancy]] was founded in [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1990.

==Farmland protection==
Farmland protection refers to programs in the [[United States]], operated mostly at state and local levels by government agencies or private entities such as [[land trust]]s, that are designed to limit conversion of [[agricultural land]] to other uses that otherwise might have been more financially attractive to the land owner. Every [[U.S. state|state]] provides tax relief through differential (preferential) assessment, and has right-to-farm laws. Less common approaches include establishing agricultural districts, using [[Agricultural zoning|zoning]] to protect agricultural land,&lt;ref name=Montgomery&gt;See, for example, [[Montgomery County, Maryland Agricultural Reserve]].&lt;/ref&gt; purchasing development rights, and [[transferable development rights]].&lt;ref name=Montgomery /&gt;

==Management of protected farmland==
[[Conservation easement]] is one approach used to manage protected farms.

A [[transferable development rights]] program offers landowners financial incentives or bonuses for the conservation and maintenance of agricultural land. [[Land development|Land developers]] can purchase the development rights of certain properties within a designated "sending district" and transfer the rights to another "receiving district" to increase the density of their new development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.farmland.org//programs/states/wa/documents/APPENDIXH-Transferofdevelopmentrights.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116082248/http://www.farmland.org//programs/states/wa/documents/APPENDIXH-Transferofdevelopmentrights.pdf |title=Transfer of Development Rights; Fact Sheet |date=April 2008 |archive-date=2011-01-16 |publisher=American Farmland Trust |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A widely-noted example of a sending district is the [[Montgomery County, Maryland Agricultural Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://montgomeryplanning.org/planning/agricultural-reserve/ |title=Agricultural Reserve |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-02-23 |publisher=Montgomery County Planning Department |location=Silver Spring, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37431">The '''Global 200''' is the list of [[ecoregion]]s identified by [[World Wide Fund for Nature|
WWF]], the global conservation organization, as priorities for conservation. According to WWF, an ecoregion is defined as a "relatively large unit of land or water containing a characteristic set of natural communities that share a large majority of their species dynamics, and environmental conditions".&lt;ref&gt;Olson, D. M. &amp; E. Dinerstein. 1998. The Global 200: A representation approach to conserving the Earth’s most biologically valuable ecoregions. ''Conservation Biol.'' 12:502–515.[http://planet.uwc.ac.za/nisl/Biodiversity/pdf/OlsonDinerstein1998.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, D. M., Dinerstein, E. 2002. The Global 200: Priority ecoregions for global conservation. ''Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden'' 89(2):199-224, [http://coastalforests.tfcg.org/pubs/Global%20200%20ecoregion.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Nature Conservancy. 1997. ''Designing a geography of hope: guidelines for ecoregion-based conservation in The Nature Conservancy''. The Nature Conservancy, Arlington, Virginia&lt;/ref&gt; So, for example, based on their levels of [[endemism]], Madagascar gets multiple listings, ancient Lake Baikal gets one, and the North American Great Lakes get none. 

The WWF assigns a conservation status to each ecoregion in the Global 200: '''critical or endangered'''; '''vulnerable'''; and '''relatively stable or intact'''. Over half of the ecoregions in the Global 200 are rated endangered.
{{TOC limit|3}}
==Background==
The WWF has identified 867 [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s across the Earth's land surface, as well as [[freshwater ecoregion|freshwater]] and [[marine ecoregion]]s. The goal of this classification system is to ensure that the full range of [[ecosystem]]s will be represented in regional conservation and development strategies. Of these ecoregions, the WWF selected the Global 200 as the ecoregions most crucial to the [[Conservation ethic|conservation]] of global [[biodiversity]]. The Global 200 list actually contains 238 ecoregions, made up of 142 terrestrial, 53 freshwater, and 43 marine ecoregions.

[[conservation movement|Conservationist]]s interested in preserving biodiversity have generally focused on the preservation of [[tropical moist broadleaf forests]] (commonly known as tropical rainforests) because it is estimated that they harbor one half of Earth's species. On the other hand, the WWF determined that a more comprehensive strategy for conserving global biodiversity should also consider the other half of species, as well as the [[ecosystem]]s that support them.

Several habitats, such as [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] [[biome]], were determined to be more threatened than tropical rain forests, and therefore require concerted conservation action. WWF maintains that "although conservation action typically takes place at the country level, patterns of biodiversity and ecological processes (e.g., migration) do not conform to political boundaries", which is why ecoregion-based conservation strategies are deemed essential.

===Classification===
Historically, zoologists and botanists have developed various classification systems that take into account the world's plant and animal communities. Two of the worldwide classification systems most commonly used today were summarized by [[Miklos Udvardy]] in 1975.

The Earth's land surface can be divided into eight [[biogeographical realms]] (formerly called kingdoms, and which the BBC calls [[ecozone]]s) that represent the major terrestrial communities of animals and plants, and are a synthesis of previous systems of [[floristic province]]s and faunal regions. The biome system classifies the world into ecosystem types (i.e. forests, grasslands, etc.) based on climate and vegetation. Each biogeographical realm contains multiple biomes, and biomes occur across several biogeographical realms. A system of [[biogeographical provinces]] was developed to identify specific geographic areas in each biogeographical realm that were of a consistent biome type, and shared distinct plant and animal communities. The WWF system represents a further refinement of the system of biomes (which the WWF calls "major habitat types"), biogeographical realms, and biogeographical provinces (the WWF scheme divides most biogeographical provinces into multiple smaller ecoregions).

===Selection process===
Based on a comprehensive list of [[ecoregion]]s, The Global 200 includes all major habitat types (biomes), all [[ecosystem]] types, and [[species]] from every major habitat type. It focuses on each major habitat type of every continent (such as [[tropical forest]]s or [[coral reef]]s). It uses [[ecoregion]]s as the unit of scale for comparison. WWF say ecoregions could be considered as conservation units at regional scale because they meet similar biological communities.

Some ecoregions were selected over other ecoregions of the same major habitat type (biome) or ecozone. Selection of the Global 200 relied on extensive studies of 19 terrestrial, freshwater, and marine major habitat types. Selection of the ecoregions was based on analyses of species richness, species [[endemic (ecology)|endemism]], unique higher [[taxon|taxa]], unusual ecological or evolutionary phenomena, and global rarity of major habitat type.

Global 200 ecoregion list is most helpful to conservation efforts at a regional scale: local [[deforestation]], destruction of swamp habitats, degradation of soils, etc. However, certain phenomena, such as bird or whale [[Fish migration|migration]], depend on more complex parameters not used to define the current [[database]], such as atmospheric currents and dynamic [[pelagic]] ecosystems. These would require gathering more information, and co-ordination of efforts between multiple ecoregions. However, the Global 200 ecoregions can help these efforts by identifying habitat sites and resting sites for migratory animals. It may also help identify the origin of [[invasive species]], and offer insights for slowing down or stopping their intrusion.

When used in a sexual context, '''groping''' or '''fondling''' is [[Physical intimacy|touching]] another person in an unwelcome sexual way. The term generally has a negative connotation in many societies, and the activity may be considered [[sexual assault]]. ''[[Toucherism]]'', considered a [[paraphilia]], describes the practice of a person touching another non-consenting person with their hands, typically in crowds, for their own sexual pleasure. Touching a consenting person's body during [[sexual activity]], [[massage]], or [[medical examination]] is not usually considered groping, though the term is sometimes used to include clumsy, selfish, or inappropriate sexual touching.  Areas of the body most frequently groped include the [[buttocks]], [[breast]]s, [[vulva]] and [[thigh]]s on a woman, and the [[penis]], [[testicle]]s and buttocks on a man. Gropers might use their hands, but pressing any part of their body against another person can be considered groping.

The incidence of groping varies around the world, and some countries have acquired a reputation for it. In some countries, it is common for a woman's buttocks to be pinched or slapped in a crowded area. In many countries, non-consensual sexual touching of any part of another person's body is considered to be sexual assault and is illegal, but in almost all countries it is considered unacceptable behaviour. Italy used to have a reputation for men pinching women's bottoms, and the term groping could perhaps be applied, but it was not a common term at that time (mid-20th century, for example). Japan has a reputation for females being groped on trains and buses to the extent that the authorities have implemented anti-groping campaigns, which has received considerable media attention and been the subject of serious study in recent years. In parts of [[South Asia]], including [[India]],&lt;ref&gt;The Express Tribune, July 8, 2013: [http://tribune.com.pk/story/572526/eve-teasing-the-power-game/ Eve teasing: The power game], by Tehniya S Afridi.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nepal]]&lt;ref&gt;Smriti Lakhey, [http://www.wavemag.com.np/issue/article1549.html  "Eve Teasing"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620213348/http://www.wavemag.com.np/issue/article1549.html |date=2010-06-20 }}, ''[[Wave (magazine)|Wave]]'' # 55, July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bangladesh]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailystar.net/eve-teasers-beat-dead-youth-in-dhaka-45137  "Eve-teasers beat dead youth in Dhaka"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012100511/http://www.thedailystar.net/eve-teasers-beat-dead-youth-in-dhaka-45137 |date=2014-10-12 }}, ''[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|Daily Star]]'', 11 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; public [[sexual harassment]] or [[Sexual assault|molestation]] (often known as "[[street harassment]]") of women by men is widely referred to as [[Eve teasing]].

In Japan, men who grope women in public are called ''chikan'' (痴漢, チカン, or ちかん); and the term also describes the act itself. Crowded trains are a favorite location for groping and a 2001 survey conducted in two Tokyo high schools revealed that more than 2/3rds of students had been groped while traveling on them.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buerk|first1=Roland|title=Tokyo police act on train gropers|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8254389.stm|accessdate=12 November 2017|work=BBC|agency=BBC|publisher=BBC|date=14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the effort to combat the problem, some railway companies designate [[women-only passenger car]]s during rush hours.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071226060039/http://www.belsona-strategic.com/hisandhers_subway.htm The His and Hers Subway]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/International/story?id=803965&amp;CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 "Japan Tries Women Only Train Cars to Stop Groping: Tokyo Subway Experiment Attempts to Slow Epidemic of Subway Fondling"] An ABC News article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071218143817/http://www.truthout.org/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi/35/11500 "Women Only Cars on Commuter Trains Cause Controversy in Japan"]&lt;/ref&gt; While the term is not defined in the Japanese legal system, vernacular usage of the word describes acts that violate several laws. Although crowded trains are the most frequent targets, another common setting is bicycle parking areas, where people bending over unlocking locks are targets. Chikan is often featured in [[Japanese pornography]].

This issue affects men in a different way. Since Japan has a very high conviction rate (99% by some sources), innocent men may have difficulty proving their innocence in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=20 February 2007 |title=Tokyo legal drama gets grip on groping |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=7&amp;art_id=38575&amp;sid=12296751&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20070220 |deadurl=yes |newspaper=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731162401/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=7&amp;art_id=38575&amp;sid=12296751&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20070220 |archivedate=31 July 2009 |accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film ''[[I Just Didn't Do It]]'' by Japanese film director [[Masayuki Suo]], based on a true story, focuses on a male office worker acquitted of groping after a five-year legal battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kamiya |first=Setsuko |title='I Just Didn't Do It' questions the Japanese court system |work=[[The Japan Times]] |date=2007-02-02 |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070202a6.html |accessdate=2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criminal courts have traditionally been lenient in cases of groping and have only recently made efforts to combat the social problem with tougher sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Lewis| first =Leo| title =All women trains are only way to defeat Tokyo bottom pinchers| publisher =The Times Online |date =2004-11-24| url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article394630.ece| accessdate =2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fukada, Takahiro, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090818i1.html In anonymous packed train lurk gropers]", ''The Japan Times'', August 18, 2009, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
Groping is illegal when there is no consent. The charge can vary from state to state but generally is considered to be [[sexual battery]], sexual groping, or unlawful touching. In some jurisdictions, groping is considered "Criminal Sexual Conduct", in the second to fourth degree, if there is no penetration.

*Florida: [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP)  Officer Paulo Morales, 47, of Miami, pleaded guilty to sexually groping three women in his custody. Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division stated, “The Justice Department will continue to investigate and prosecute criminal civil rights violations committed by law enforcement officials”, and U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Wifredo A. Ferrer stated, “My office and the Department of Justice are fully committed to protecting the civil rights of our citizens from all types of abuses.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/July/12-crt-913.html Department of Justice]- Retrieved 2012-08-08&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gund Institute for Environment''' (founded 1992), formerly known as the Gund Institute for Ecological Economics and more commonly known as Gund Institute, is a research institute for transdisciplinary scholarship,&lt;ref name="transdisciplinary scholarship"&gt;[http://www.transdisciplinarity.ch/e/Transdisciplinarity/ td-net: Network for Transdisciplinary Research] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130031019/http://www.transdisciplinarity.ch/e/Transdisciplinarity/ |date=2012-01-30 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; based at the [[University of Vermont]] (UVM) and comprising diverse faculty, students, and collaborators worldwide. The Gund Institute offers graduate-level training where students are exposed to a wide range of expertise, perspectives, and techniques through course offerings, weekly discussions and seminars, and research mentoring. The Gund Institute offers a Certificate of Graduate Study in Ecological Economics, available both to UVM Graduate students and to anyone pursuing continuing education. In addition, it has a series of problem-solving workshops called "Ateliers" and nearly two hundred educational videos.&lt;ref name="Gund Youtube Channel"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/user/GundInstitute Gund Youtube Channel], https://www.youtube.com/user/GundInstitute.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
[[Image:UVM JohnsonHouse 20160521.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Johnson House (University of Vermont)|Johnson House]] at [[University of Vermont|UVM]], current home of the Gund Institute]]
The purpose of the Gund Institute is to conduct research at the interface of [[ecological]], [[social]], and [[economic]] systems, develop creative, practical solutions to local and global environmental challenges, and provide future leaders with the tools and understanding necessary to navigate the transition to a [[sustainable]] society.&lt;ref name="Official Website"&gt;[http://www.uvm.edu/giee Our Community], www.uvm.edu/giee.&lt;/ref&gt; Led by Director [http://www.uvm.edu/rsenr/taylorricketts/ Taylor Ricketts], the Gund Institute is a community comprising Gund Fellows, Affiliates, Graduate Students, Visiting Scholars, and Staff. At UVM, faculty aren't appointed to the Institute itself but are affiliated with other departments all around the university.

== Projects ==
Three broad, interrelated themes provide centers of gravity for the Gund Institute's research, training, and outreach activities: Nature's Benefits, Ecological Economies, and Healthy Landscapes and Seascapes.&lt;ref name="Official Website" /&gt; Among their research projects are the [http://vtdigger.org/?s=gund+institute&amp;submit=Submit Vermont Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20120508062358/http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/urgentissues/peopleandconservation/natural-capital.xml Natural Capital Project].

== History ==
The Gund Institute was founded by [[Robert Costanza]] in 1991 as the Institute for Ecological Economics at the [[University of Maryland]]. In 2002, it was moved to the UVM's [[Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources]] and renamed the Gund Institute, after its major benefactors, the Gund family of Cleveland, Ohio. Robert Costanza continued as Director until 2010, when he left to help build a similar institute at Portland State University. [[Jon David Erickson|Jon Erickson]] was Managing Director from 2009 to 2012. Taylor Ricketts, former Director of the Conservation Science Program of the [[World Wildlife Fund]], was recruited as Director in 2011.

==Impact==
The film has been studied due to its impact on German society  involving the sociopolitical implications of the intervention by the West German federal government in matters of sexual education involving the [[mass media]] as well as the curriculum they approved regarding sexual matters. The West German federal government used the film as an educational tool but also as a means to gain influence in areas such as public health and education which were traditionally under regional jurisdiction,  possibly even bypassing constitutional issues governing the distribution of powers between the Federal government and the regions. Up to that time, regional authorities could veto Federal policies which were seen by  them as encroaching on their cultural policies.&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt; 

The success of the film when viewed by an audience of a wide and diverse demographic was analysed in terms of its influence on social thinking. [[Gender issues]] related to the film have been considered due to the fact that matters  traditionally concerning privacy, intimacy and femininity, up to that point in time, were made public to a wide demographic through film and the mass media. The commercial success of the film has also been examined since it was a sex-education film without any famous actors or an elaborate plot.&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt; The film was successful in countries such as France, Italy and England which were considered "prudish" at the time.&lt;ref name="Jogschies1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rainer Jogschies|title=Wer zweimal mit derselben pennt--: die befreiten Sechziger|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XthGAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Helga+%E2%80%93+Vom+Werden+des+menschlichen+Lebens%22&amp;dq=%22Helga+%E2%80%93+Vom+Werden+des+menschlichen+Lebens%22|year=1991|publisher=Ullstein|page=75|quote=So sah denn Helga - vom Werden des menschlichen Lebens (1967) auch aus - und wurde dadurch im noch prüderen Frankreich, England und Italien ein überraschender Kassenerfolg.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Paris, 1,500 catholic priests and nuns attended a private screening of the film arranged by ''centrale catholique''. The film was also extensively covered by print media such as ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' and ''[[Paris Match]]''.&lt;ref name="Julian2011"/&gt;

The film was a product of a political decision by the West German Federal government to educate the people regarding matters related to procreation and [[family planning]] at a time of advances in the fields of human genetics and contraception. The film gained acceptance in the young adult demographic due to their desire to be informed about issues related to family planning and childbirth as part of a consumer society in which women had to work. Educators, although worried about the impact of the violence of the scenes during childbirth upon the young, also accepted that the film could aid the understanding of husbands concerning the great pains experienced by their wives during childbirth. The film also  presented a new model of informed motherhood based on knowledge and social awareness.&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt;

==Reception==
The film received generally positive reviews, with the conservative press leading the way. ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' described the film as "enlightening in a comprehensive and rational manner, without hypocrisy and false shame".&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt; The critic added: {{blockquote|The cell proliferation is an aesthetic pleasure, an opal-like miracle of colour with effects of light and  backlight, a piece of art from the era of [[Tachisme]]. The colours are so nice, the fast changes so wonderful that one nearly forgets the subject. Other processes [e.g. the representation of the different stages of the embryo] were still difficult to represent, some shots succeeded here for the first time; experts will rack their brains over how this was achieved}}

The conservative ''Mindener Tageblatt'' commented that "the really scientific information had been conveyed in a flawlessly proper manner without prudery and without arousing inappropriate sexual feelings".&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt;

The left-liberal press was more critical of the film. The ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' critic remarked that:&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt; {{blockquote|we are at the point of wasting one of our basic rights: the right to keep silent and to privacy [verschlossene Türen] about certain aspects of life which should not be revealed to the public eye as they belong to the private sphere of human nature.}}

The press which was present at the [[sneak preview]] also criticised the film's "ridiculous frame action", "heavy didactic tone" and "lack of contraceptive information". Women correspondents also complained that Helga in "her perfect makeup" during childbirth "did not adequately depict the pain of the anonymous woman in labour".&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt;

Other audience reactions included those of some teenage girls which were shocked by the [[placenta]] removal scenes and the subsequent revelations that the placenta was used for the production of cosmetics. The perspective and appearance of medical instruments was also criticised as reminiscent of a horror film.&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt;

The ''Protestant Film Observer'' criticised the presentation  aspects of the film and the absence of information on family planning, [[birth control]] and [[abortion]].&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt;

[[File:Homology vertebrates-en.svg&lt;!-- This image, Homology vertebrates-en.svg, is referred to in the text! Please don't change it without also updating the text with something equally or more suitable. --&gt;|thumb|300px|The principle of homology: The biological relationships (shown by colours) of the bones in the forelimbs of vertebrates were used by [[Charles Darwin]] as an argument in favor of [[evolution]].]]

In [[biology]], '''homology''' is the existence of shared ancestry between a pair of structures, or genes, in different [[Taxon|taxa]]. A common example of homologous structures is the forelimbs of [[vertebrates]], where the [[Bat wing development|wings of bats]], the arms of [[primate]]s, the front flippers of [[whale]]s and the forelegs of [[Canidae|dogs]] and [[Equidae|horses]] are all derived from the same ancestral [[tetrapod]] structure. [[Evolutionary biology]] explains homologous structures [[adaptation (biology)|adapted]] to different purposes as the result of descent with modification from a [[Common descent|common ancestor]]. The term was first applied to biology in a non-evolutionary context by the anatomist [[Richard Owen]] in 1843. Homology was later explained by [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution in 1859, but had been observed before this, from [[Aristotle's biology|Aristotle]] onwards, and it was explicitly analysed by [[Pierre Belon]] in 1555.

In [[developmental biology]], organs that developed in the embryo in the same manner and from similar origins, such as from matching [[Primordium|primordia]] in successive segments of the same animal, are [[serial homology|serially homologous]]. Examples include the legs of a [[centipede]], the [[Insect mouthparts|maxillary palp]] and [[Insect mouthparts|labial palp]] of an insect, and the [[Vertebral column|spinous processes]] of successive [[Vertebral column|vertebrae]] in a [[vertebral column]]. Male and female [[reproductive organ]]s are homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue, as do the [[ovaries]] and [[testicles]] of mammals including humans.

[[Sequence homology]] between [[protein]] or [[DNA sequence]]s is similarly defined in terms of shared ancestry.  Two segments of DNA can have shared ancestry because of either a [[speciation]] event (orthologs) or a [[Gene duplication|duplication event]] (paralogs). Homology among proteins or DNA is inferred from their sequence similarity.  Significant similarity is strong evidence that two sequences are related by [[divergent evolution]] from a common ancestor. [[Sequence alignment|Alignments]] of multiple sequences are used to discover the homologous regions.

Homology remains controversial in [[ethology|animal behaviour]], but there is suggestive evidence that, for example, [[dominance hierarchies]] are homologous across the [[primates]].

==History==
[[File:BelonBirdSkel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Pierre Belon]] compared the skeletons of birds and humans in his ''Book of Birds'' (1555).&lt;ref name=Panchen1999&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Panchen |first1=A. L. |title=Homology—history of a concept |journal=Novartis Found Symp |date=1999 |volume=222 |pages=5–18 |pmid=10332750}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Homology was noticed by [[Aristotle's biology|Aristotle]] (c. 350 BC), and was explicitly analysed by [[Pierre Belon]] in his 1555 ''Book of Birds'', where he systematically compared the skeletons of birds and humans. The pattern of similarity was interpreted as part of the static [[great chain of being]] through the [[mediaeval]] and [[early modern]] periods: it was not then seen as implying evolutionary change.
In the German ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'' tradition, homology was of special interest as demonstrating unity in nature.&lt;ref name=Panchen1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brigandt/&gt;
In 1790, [[Goethe]] stated his [[foliar theory]] in his essay "Metamorphosis of Plants", showing that flower part are derived from leaves.&lt;ref name=Dornelas&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1590/S1677-04202005000400001 |title=From leaf to flower: Revisiting Goethe's concepts on the ¨metamorphosis¨ of plants |year=2005 |last1=Dornelas |first1=Marcelo Carnier |last2=Dornelas |first2=Odair |journal=Brazilian Journal of Plant Physiology |volume=17 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[serial homology]] of limbs was described late in the 18th century.
The French zoologist [[Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] showed in 1818 in his ''theorie d'analogue'' ("theory of homologues") that structures were shared between fishes, reptiles, birds, and mammals. When Geoffroy went further and sought homologies between [[Georges Cuvier]]'s ''[[embranchement]]s'', such as vertebrates and molluscs, his claims triggered the 1830 [[Cuvier-Geoffroy debate]]. Geoffroy stated the principle of connections, namely that what is important is the relative position of different structures and their connections to each other.
The Estonian [[embryologist]] [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] stated what are now called [[von Baer's laws]] in 1828, noting that related animals begin their development as similar embryos and then diverge: thus, animals in the same [[family (biology)|family]] are more closely related and diverge later than animals which are only in the same [[order (biology)|order]] and have fewer homologies. von Baer's theory recognises that each [[taxon]] (such as a family) has distinctive shared features, and that embryonic development parallels the taxonomic hierarchy: not the same as [[recapitulation theory]].
The term "homology" was first used in biology by the anatomist [[Richard Owen]] in 1843 when studying the similarities of vertebrate [[fin]]s and limbs, contrasting it with the matching term "analogy" which he used to describe different structures with the same function.
Richard Owen codified 3 main criteria for determining if features were homologous: position, development, composition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1859, [[Charles Darwin]] explained homologous structures as meaning that the organisms concerned shared a [[body plan]] from a common ancestor, and that taxa were branches of a single [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]].&lt;ref name=Panchen1999/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sommer |first1=R.

Biological structures or sequences in different [[taxon|taxa]] are homologous if they are derived from a [[common descent|common ancestor]]. Homology thus implies [[divergent evolution]]. For example, many [[insect]]s (such as [[dragonfly|dragonflies]]) possess two pairs of flying [[wing (insect)|wings]]. In [[beetle]]s, the first pair of wings has evolved into a pair of [[elytron|hard wing covers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wagner |first=Günter P. |title=Homology, Genes, and Evolutionary Innovation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g7vzAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53 |year=2014 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-1-4008-5146-1 |pages=53–54 |quote=elytra have very little similarity with typical wings, but are clearly homologous to forewings.

Similarly, the forelimbs of ancestral [[vertebrate]]s have evolved into the front flippers of [[whale]]s, the wings of [[bird]]s, the running forelegs of [[dog]]s, [[deer]], and [[horse]]s, the short forelegs of [[frog]]s and [[lizard]]s, and the grasping [[hand]]s of [[primate]]s including humans. The same major forearm bones ([[humerus]], [[Radius (bone)|radius]], and [[ulna]]{{efn|These are coloured in the lead image: humerus brown, radius pale buff, ulna red.}}) are found in fossils of [[lobe-finned fish]] such as ''[[Eusthenopteron]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homology: Legs and Limbs|url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/0_0_0/homology_02|publisher=UC Berkeley|accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposite of homologous organs are [[Analogy (biology)|analogous]] organs which do similar jobs in two taxa that were not [[phylogeny|present in their last common ancestor]] but rather [[convergent evolution|evolved separately]]. For example, the [[insect wing|wings of insects]] and birds evolved independently in [[phylum (biology)|widely separated groups]], and converged functionally to support powered [[flight]], so they are analogous. Similarly, the wings of a [[sycamore maple]] seed and the wings of a bird are analogous but not homologous, as they develop from quite different structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Secret Found to Flight of 'Helicopter Seeds' |url=http://www.livescience.com/3672-secret-flight-helicopter-seeds.html |publisher=LiveScience |accessdate=2 March 2017 |date=11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lentink, D.; Dickson, W.

===In cladistics===
{{further|Cladistics}}

Specialised terms are used in taxonomic research. Primary homology is a researcher's initial hypothesis based on similar structure or anatomical connections, suggesting that a character state in two or more taxa share is shared due to common ancestry. Primary homology may be conceptually broken down further:  we may consider all of the states of the same character as "homologous" parts of a single, unspecified, transformation series.  This has been referred to as topographical correspondence.  For example, in an aligned DNA sequence matrix, all of the A, G, C, T or implied gaps at a given nucleotide site are homologous in this way.  Character state identity is the hypothesis that the particular condition in two or more taxa is "the same" as far as our character coding scheme is concerned.  Thus, two Adenines at the same aligned nucleotide site are hypothesized to be homologous unless that hypothesis is subsequently contradicted by other evidence.  Secondary homology is implied by [[parsimony analysis]], where a character state that arises only once on a tree is taken to be homologous.&lt;ref name="de Pinna1991"&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.1991.tb00045.x| title=Concepts and Tests of homology in the cladistic paradigm| year=1991| last1=de Pinna | first1=M.

&lt;/ref&gt; As implied in this definition, many [[cladistics|cladists]] consider secondary homology to be synonymous with [[synapomorphy]], a shared derived character or [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] state that distinguishes a [[clade]] from other organisms.&lt;ref name="PageHolmes2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Page, Roderick D.M. |author2=Holmes, Edward C. |title=Molecular Evolution: A Phylogenetic Approach |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2lWhjuK8m8C |date=2009 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-4443-1336-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brower, A.

Shared ancestral character states, symplesiomorphies, represent either synapomorphies of a more inclusive group, or complementary states (often absences) that unite no natural group of organisms.  For example, the presence of wings is a synapomorphy for pterygote insects, but a symplesiomorphy for holometabolous insects.  Absence of wings in non-pterygote insects and other organisms is a complementary symplesiomorphy that unites no group (for example, absence of wings provides no evidence of common ancestry of silverfish, spiders and annelid worms).  On the other hand, absence (or secondary loss) of wings is a synapomorphy for fleas.  Patterns such as these lead many cladists to consider the concept of homology and the concept of synapomorphy to be equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, C. 1982. Morphological characters and homology.

The three small bones in the [[middle ear]] of mammals including humans, the [[malleus]], [[incus]], and [[stapes]], are today used to transmit sound from the [[eardrum]] to the [[inner ear]]. The malleus and incus develop in the embryo from structures that form jaw bones (the quadrate and the articular) in lizards, and in fossils of lizard-like ancestors of mammals. Both lines of evidence show that these bones are homologous, sharing a common ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Homology: From jaws to ears — an unusual example of a homology|url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/homology_06|publisher=UC Berkeley |accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudimentary organs such as the human [[coccyx|tailbone]], now much reduced from their functional state, are readily understood as signs of [[evolution]], the explanation being that they were cut down by [[natural selection]] from functioning organs when their functions were no longer needed, but make no sense at all if species are considered to be fixed. The tailbone is homologous to the tails of other primates.{{sfn|Larson|2004|p=112}}

{{further|ABC model of flower development}}

The four types of flower parts, namely [[carpel]]s, [[stamen]]s, [[petal]]s, and [[sepal]]s, are homologous with and derived from leaves, as [[Goethe]] correctly noted in 1790. The development of these parts through a pattern of [[gene expression]] in the growing zones ([[meristem]]s) is described by the [[ABC model of flower development]]. Each of the four types of flower parts is serially repeated in concentric whorls, controlled by a small number of genes acting in various combinations. Thus, A genes working alone result in sepal formation; A and B together produce petals; B and C together create stamens; C alone produces carpels. When none of the genes are active, leaves are formed. Two more groups of genes, D to form [[ovule]]s and E for the floral whorls, complete the model. The genes are evidently ancient, as old as the [[flowering plants]] themselves.&lt;ref name="Dornelas"/&gt;

==Developmental biology==
[[File:Pachyrhachis problematicus 45.JPG|thumb|The [[Cretaceous]] snake ''[[Pachyrhachis problematicus]]'' had hind legs (circled).]]

[[Developmental biology]] can identify homologous structures that arose from the same tissue in [[embryogenesis]]. For example, adult [[snake]]s have no legs, but their early embryos have limb-buds for hind legs, which are soon lost as the embryos develop. The implication that the ancestors of snakes had hind legs is confirmed by [[fossil]] evidence: the [[Cretaceous]] snake ''[[Pachyrhachis problematicus]]'' had hind legs complete with hip bones ([[ilium (bone)|ilium]], [[pubis (bone)|pubis]], [[ischium]]), thigh bone ([[femur]]), leg bones ([[tibia]], [[fibula]]) and foot bones ([[calcaneum]], [[astragalus]]) as in tetrapods with legs today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Homologies: developmental biology |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/lines_07 |publisher=UC Berkeley |accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with anatomical structures, [[sequence homology]] between [[protein]] or [[DNA sequence]]s is defined in terms of shared ancestry.  Two segments of DNA can have shared ancestry because of either a [[speciation]] event ([[Sequence homology#Orthology|orthologs]]) or a [[Gene duplication|duplication event]] ([[Sequence homology#Paralogy|paralogs]]). Homology among proteins or DNA is typically inferred from their sequence similarity.  Significant similarity is strong evidence that two sequences are related by divergent evolution of a common ancestor.  [[Sequence alignment|Alignments]] of multiple sequences are used to indicate which regions of each sequence are homologous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Koonin, E. V. |title=Orthologs, Paralogs, and Evolutionary Genomics |journal=Annual Review of Genetics |volume=39 |issue= |pages=309–38 |year=2005 |pmid=16285863 |doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.39.073003.114725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homologous sequences are orthologous if they are descended from the same ancestral sequence separated by a [[speciation]] event: when a species diverges into two separate species, the copies of a single gene in the two resulting species are said to be ''orthologous''. The term "ortholog" was coined in 1970 by the [[molecular evolution]]ist [[Walter M. Fitch|Walter Fitch]].&lt;ref name="Fitch WM 99–113"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fitch, W. M. |title=Distinguishing homologous from analogous proteins |journal=Systematic Zoology |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=99–113 |date=June 1970 |pmid=5449325 |doi=10.2307/2412448|jstor=2412448 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homologous sequences are paralogous if they were created by a duplication event within the genome. For [[gene duplication]] events, if a gene in an organism is duplicated to occupy two different positions in the same genome, then the two copies are paralogous. Paralogous genes often belong to the same species. They can shape the structure of whole genomes and thus explain genome evolution to a large extent. Examples include the [[Homeobox]] ([[Hox gene|Hox]]) genes in animals. These genes not only underwent gene duplications within [[chromosome]]s but also [[Genome evolution|whole genome duplications]]. As a result, Hox genes in most vertebrates are spread across multiple chromosomes: the HoxA–D clusters are the best studied.&lt;ref name=Zakany&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zakany |first=Jozsef |last2=Duboule |first2=Denis |date=2007 |title=The role of Hox genes during vertebrate limb development |journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=359–366 |doi=10.1016/j.gde.2007.05.011|issn=0959-437X |pmid=17644373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In behaviour==
{{main|Homology (psychology)}}

It has been suggested that some behaviours might be homologous, based either on sharing across related taxa or on common origins of the behaviour in an individual's development, though this remains controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moore |first=David S |title=Importing the homology concept from biology into developmental psychology |journal=Developmental Psychobiology |year=2013 |volume=55 |issue=1|pages=13–21 |doi=10.1002/dev.21015 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dev.21015/full |pmid=22711075}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, D. W. Rajecki and Randall C. Flanery, using data on humans and on nonhuman [[primates]], argue that patterns of behaviour in [[dominance hierarchies]] are homologous across the primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rajecki, D.

This agreement of unusual characteristics is found at several levels, including fine motor movement, gross motor movement, and behavior at the group level.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[telecommunication]], a '''hop''' is a portion of a signal's journey from source to receiver. Examples include:
#The excursion of a [[radio wave]] from the [[Earth]] to the [[ionosphere]] and back to the Earth.  The number of hops indicates the number of reflections from the ionosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Standard 1037C]]&lt;/ref&gt;
#A similar excursion from an [[earth station]] to a [[communications satellite]] to another station, counted similarly except that if the return trip is not by satellite, then it's only a half hop.
#In [[routing]], a hop is the step from one [[Router (computing)|router]] to the next, on the path of a [[Packet (information technology)|packet]] on any communications network. On the [[Internet]] the hops a packet takes may be discovered with [[Ping (networking utility)|ping]]s or [[traceroute]]s. The hop count is the total number of steps along the path from source to sink. In this context, the term "hop" is sometimes said to be an acronym for "hand-over point".

Humanistic Intelligence (HI) is defined, in the context of [[wearable computing]], by [[Marvin Minsky]], [[Ray Kurzweil]], and [[Steve Mann]], as follows:
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
Humanistic Intelligence [HI] is intelligence that arises because of a human being in the feedback loop of a computational process, where the human and computer are inextricably intertwined.  When a wearable computer embodies HI and becomes so technologically advanced that its intelligence matches our own biological brain, something much more powerful emerges from this synergy that gives rise to superhuman intelligence within the single “cyborg” being.&lt;ref&gt;"The Society of Intelligent Veillance", by Kurzweil, Minsky, and Mann, in Proceedings of the IEEE ISTAS 2013, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, pp13-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
More generally (beyond only wearable computing), HI describes the creation of  [[intelligence]] that results from a [[feedback loop]] between a computational process and a human being, where the human and computer are inextricably intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.eyetap.org/papers/docs/HumanisticComputing_Mann1998_ProcIEEE.pdf|title=Humanistic Computing|author=S.

In the field of [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI) it has been common to think of the human and computer as separate entities. HCI emphasizes this separateness by treating the human and computer as different entities that interact.  However, HI theory thinks of the wearer and the computer with its associated input and output facilities not as separate entities, but  regards the computer as a second [[brain]] and its [[sensory modality|sensory modalities]] as additional senses, in which synthetic [[synesthesia]] merges with the wearer's senses. When a wearable computer functions in a successful embodiment of HI, the computer uses the human's mind and body as one of its [[peripheral]]s, just as the human uses the computer as a peripheral. This reciprocal relationship is at the heart of HI.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Hydrodynamic separators''' (HDS) are [[stormwater]] management devices that use [[cyclonic separation]] to control [[water pollution]].  They are designed as flow-through structures with a settling or separation unit to remove [[sediment]] and other pollutants.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Storm Water Technology Fact Sheet: Hydrodynamic Separators |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P1000ZRK.txt |date=September 1999 |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, DC |id=EPA 832-F-99-017}}&lt;/ref&gt; HDS are considered structural [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]] (BMPs), and are used to treat and pre-treat stormwater [[surface runoff|runoff]].

== Design and applications ==
HDS systems use the physics of flowing water to remove a variety of pollutants and are characterized by an internal structure that either creates a swirling [[vortex]] or plunges the water into the main sump.&lt;ref name="Mohseni"&gt;Mohseni, Omid; Saddoris, David A.; McIntire, Kurtis D.; Gulliver, John S. (2010). [http://www.cts.umn.edu/Publications/ResearchReports/reportdetail.html?id=1890 "Hydrodynamic Separator Sediment Retention Testing."] Technical Report No. MN/RC 2010-10. St. Paul, MN: Minnesota Department of Transportation.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} Along with supplemental features to reduce velocity, an HDS system is designed to separate floatables (trash, debris and oil) and settleable particles, like sediment, from stormwater. HDS systems are not effective for the removal of very fine [[suspended solids|solids]] or dissolved pollutants.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact1" /&gt; The systems are also subject to scour and sediment washout during large storm events, e.g. a 10-year storm.&lt;ref name="Mohseni" /&gt;{{rp|42}}

== Evaluation ==
A number of factors are relevant in selecting a hydrodynamic separator product for a site.

=== Sizing and treatment performance ===
HDS systems should be sized based on treatment objectives including desired level of pollutant removal, drainage basin characteristics, climate of the region, and particle size to be targeted. Performance is also sensitive to water temperature, i.e. season.{{clarify|date=April 2016}} Care must be taken to avoid routing excess flow through the device and compromising performance. Each vendor’s product has different pollutant removal rates that should be evaluated before selecting the system.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact1" /&gt;

The TAPE and TARP programs are evaluation programs sponsored by several state agencies in the U.S. These programs include lab and field testing and provide specific sizing criteria for hydrodynamic separation systems.&lt;ref&gt;State of Washington. Department of Ecology. Olympia, WA. [http://www.ecy.wa.gov/pubs/0210037.pdf Technology Assessment Protocol - Ecology (TAPE): Guidance for Evaluating Emerging Stormwater Treatment Technologies.] January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). Trenton, NJ (2007). [http://www.state.nj.us/dep/dsr/bscit/TARPMain.htm "Technology Acceptance and Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) Program."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey Corporation for Advanced Technology (NJCAT). Bordentown, NJ. [http://www.njcat.org/education/glossary.cfm "A Comprehensive Approach to Performance Verification for Stormwater Treatment Systems."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010183709/http://www.njcat.org/education/glossary.cfm |date=2008-10-10 }} Accessed 2011-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the EWRI-ASCE and the ASTM International are developing comprehensive verification guidelines and standard test methods for assessing the performance of these devices.

=== Maintenance and inspection requirements ===
HDS systems are not maintenance-intensive, when compared with land-based BMP’s.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact1" /&gt; Each manufactured system is different, therefore maintenance and inspection requirements should be looked at closely when purchasing an HDS system. [[Vacuum truck]]s are typically used for maintenance, so unobstructed access to accumulated pollutants for removal is critical.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

=== Installation and operating costs ===
Costs for HDS systems depend on site-specific conditions such as land characteristics, amount of runoff to be treated, system depth and performance requirements. Be aware that not all HDS systems are alike in treatment performance, and basing a decision solely on the installation and operating cost of a system may compromise system performance and the environment. Long-term maintenance costs should also be considered with overall costs when purchasing or selecting a stormwater BMP as initial installation and operating costs may not reflect the long-term investment needed to maintain the system.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact1" /&gt;

=== Land costs ===
According to the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), “Using structural BMPs that can be placed underground and are design to withstand site specific soil, groundwater and traffic loading conditions provide valuable savings in land area compared to conventional volume-based stormwater treatment practices such as ponds, wetlands, and swales.”&lt;ref name="EPA Fact1" /&gt; HDS systems may be ideal for areas where land is not readily available and/or tight retrofits are needed as they are installed underground.

== Regulations ==
As stormwater regulations become increasingly stringent, many states and municipalities have developed criteria to govern the use and sizing of HDS systems, and publish lists that identify acceptable HDS systems.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see NJDEP list of approved [http://www.njstormwater.org/treatment.html "Stormwater Manufactured Treatment Devices."] 2011-09-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Other jurisdictions evaluate the applicability of HDS on a site-specific basis.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Maryland Department of the Environment, [http://www.mde.state.md.us/assets/document/Proprietary%202005.pdf "Maryland’s Stormwater Program &amp; Proprietary Practices."] 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; It is increasingly common to use HDS as the first component of a treatment train, a combination of BMPs in series, to remove coarse solids and floatable pollutants that can rapidly clog other BMPs thus prolonging their maintenance cycle.

'''IT risk management''' is the application of [[risk management]] methods to [[information technology]] in order to manage [[IT risk]], i.e.:
:''The business risk associated with the use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence and adoption of IT within an enterprise or organization''
&lt;!----- transclusion --------&gt;
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
IT risk management can be considered a component of a wider [[enterprise risk management]] system.&lt;ref name=RISKITW&gt;[http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Research/Documents/RiskIT-FW-18Nov09-Research.pdf ISACA THE RISK IT FRAMEWORK (registration required)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment, maintenance and continuous update of an [[Information security management system]] (ISMS) provide a strong indication that a company is using a systematic approach for the identification, assessment and management of information security risks.&lt;ref name=ENISAFULL&gt;[http://www.enisa.europa.eu/act/rm/cr/risk-management-inventory/files/deliverables/risk-management-principles-and-inventories-for-risk-management-risk-assessment-methods-and-tools/at_download/fullReport Enisa Risk management, Risk assessment inventory, page 46]&lt;/ref&gt;

Different methodologies have been proposed to manage IT risks, each of them divided into processes and steps.&lt;ref name=Vacca1&gt;{{cite book

According to the [[Risk IT]] framework,&lt;ref name=RISKITW/&gt; this encompasses not only the negative impact of operations and service delivery which can bring destruction or reduction of the value of the organization, but also the benefit enabling risk associated to missing opportunities to use technology to enable or enhance business or the IT project management for aspects like overspending or late delivery with adverse business impact.{{clarify|date=September 2017|post-text=incomprehensible sentence}}

Because [[Risk#Risk as a vector quantity|risk]] is strictly tied to uncertainty, [[decision theory]] should be applied to manage risk as a science, i.e. rationally making choices under uncertainty.

Generally speaking, [[risk]] is the product of likelihood times [[result|impact]] (Risk = Likelihood * Impact).&lt;ref&gt;"Risk is a combination of the likelihood of an occurrence of a hazardous event or exposure(s) and the severity of injury or ill health that can be caused by the event or exposure(s)" (OHSAS 18001:2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The measure of an IT risk can be determined as a product of threat, vulnerability and [[asset (computing)|asset]] values:&lt;ref name=Vacca&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;Risk = Threat * Vulnerability * Asset&lt;/math&gt;

A more current Risk management framework for IT Risk would be the TIK framework:
:&lt;math&gt;Risk = ((Vulnerability * Threat) / Counter Measure) * Asset Value at Risk&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://it-risk-management.com/ IT Risk Management]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==

&lt;!----- transclusion --------&gt;
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
The [[Certified Information Systems Auditor]] Review Manual 2006 produced by ISACA, an international professional association focused on IT Governance, provides the following definition of risk management: ''"Risk management is the process of identifying [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] and [[threat (computer)|threats]] to the information resources used by an organization in achieving business objectives, and deciding what [[countermeasure (computer)|countermeasures]], if any, to take in reducing risk to an acceptable level, based on the value of the information resource to the organization."''&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | last = ISACA
 | title = CISA Review Manual 2006
 | publisher = [http://www.isaca.org/ Information Systems Audit and Control Association]
 | year = 2006
 | pages = 85
 | isbn = 1-933284-15-3 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
&lt;!----- transclusion END HERE BUT FOLLOWS --------&gt;

There is two things in this definition that may need some clarification. First, the ''process'' of risk management is an ongoing iterative [[Business process|process]]. It must be repeated indefinitely. The business environment is constantly changing and new [[threat (computer)|threats]] and [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] emerge every day. Second, the choice of [[countermeasure (computer)|countermeasures]] ([[security controls|controls]]) used to manage risks must strike a balance between productivity, cost, effectiveness of the countermeasure, and the value of the informational asset being protected.

''[[Risk management]] is the process that allows IT managers to balance the operational and economic costs of protective measures and achieve gains in mission capability by protecting the IT systems and data that support their organizations’ missions. This process is not unique to the IT environment; indeed it pervades decision-making in all areas of our daily lives''.&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;

The head of an organizational unit must ensure that the organization has the capabilities needed to accomplish its mission. These mission owners must determine the security capabilities that their IT systems must have to provide the desired level of mission support in the face of real world [[threat (computer)|threat]]s. Most organizations have tight budgets for IT security; therefore, IT security spending must be reviewed as thoroughly as other management decisions. A well-structured risk management methodology, when used effectively, can help management identify appropriate [[security controls|controls]] for providing the mission-essential security capabilities.&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;
[[File:Osa metamodel v003.png|thumb|Relationships between IT security entity]]

Risk management in the IT world is quite a complex, multi faced activity, with a lot of relations with other complex activities. The picture to the right shows the relationships between different related terms.

The American [[National Information Assurance Training and Education Center]] defines risk management in the IT field as:&lt;ref name="NIATEC Glossary of terms"&gt;[http://niatec.info/Glossary.aspx?term=4253&amp;alpha=R NIATEC Glossary of terms]&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''The total process to identify, control, and minimize the impact of uncertain events. The objective of the risk management program is to reduce risk and obtain and maintain DAA approval. The process facilitates the management of security risks by each level of management throughout the system life cycle. The approval process consists of three elements: [[Risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]], certification, and approval.''
# ''An element of managerial science concerned with the identification, measurement, control, and minimization of uncertain events. An effective risk management program encompasses the following four phases:''
##a ''Risk assessment, as derived from an evaluation of threats and vulnerabilities.''
## ''Management decision.''
## ''Control implementation.''
## ''Effectiveness review.''
# ''The total process of identifying, measuring, and minimizing uncertain events affecting AIS resources. It includes [[Risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]], cost benefit analysis, safeguard selection, security test and evaluation, safeguard implementation, and systems review.''
# ''The total process of identifying, controlling, and eliminating or minimizing uncertain events that may affect system resources. lt includes risk analysis, cost benefit analysis, selection, implementation and test, security evaluation of safeguards, and overall security review.''

== Risk management as part of enterprise risk management ==
Some organizations have, and many others should have, a comprehensive [[Enterprise risk management]] (ERM) in place. The four objective categories addressed, according to [[Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission]] (COSO) are:
* Strategy - high-level goals, aligned with and supporting the organization's mission
* Operations - effective and efficient use of resources
* Financial Reporting - reliability of operational and financial reporting
* Compliance - compliance with applicable laws and regulations
According to the [[Risk IT]] framework by [[ISACA]],&lt;ref name=riskit&gt;The Risk IT Framework by ISACA, {{ISBN|978-1-60420-111-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; IT risk is transversal to all four categories. The IT risk should be managed in the framework of Enterprise risk management: [[Risk appetite]] and Risk sensitivity of the whole enterprise should guide the IT risk management process. ERM should provide the context and business objectives to IT risk management

== Risk management methodology ==
[[File:The Risk Management Process.png|thumb|ENISA: The Risk Management Process, according to ISO Standard 13335]]
The term [[methodology]] means an organized set of principles and rules that drive action in a particular field of knowledge.&lt;ref name=Vacca1/&gt;
A methodology does not describe specific methods; nevertheless it does specify several processes that need to be followed. These processes constitute a generic framework. They may be broken down in sub-processes, they may be combined, or their sequence may change. However, any risk management exercise must carry out these processes in one form or another, The following table compares the processes foreseen by three leading standards.&lt;ref name=Vacca1/&gt; The [[ISACA]] [[Risk IT]] framework is more recent. The Risk IT Practitioner-Guide&lt;ref name=RISKITP&gt;[http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Research/ResearchDeliverables/Pages/The-Risk-IT-Practitioner-Guide.aspx The Risk IT Practitioner Guide, Appendix 3 ISACA] {{ISBN|978-1-60420-116-1}} (registration required)&lt;/ref&gt; compares Risk IT and ISO 27005.
The overall comparison is illustrated in the following table.

Due to the probabilistic nature and the need of cost benefit analysis, IT risks are managed following a process that according to [[NIST]] SP 800-30 can be divided in the following steps:&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;
# [[risk assessment]],
# [[#Risk mitigation|risk mitigation]], and
# [[evaluation]] and [[wikt:assessment|assessment]].

Effective risk management must be totally integrated into the [[Systems Development Life Cycle]].&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;

Information [[Risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]] conducted on applications, computer installations, networks and systems under development should be undertaken using structured methodologies.&lt;ref name=SOGP&gt;[https://www.isfsecuritystandard.com Standard of Good Practice by Information Security Forum (ISF) Section SM3.4 Information risk analysis methodologies]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context establishment ==
This step is the first step in [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] [[ISO/IEC 27005]] framework. Most of the elementary activities are foreseen as the first sub process of Risk assessment according to [[NIST]] SP 800-30.
This step implies the acquisition of all relevant information about the organization and the determination of the basic criteria, purpose, scope and boundaries of risk management activities and the organization in charge of risk management activities. The purpose is usually the compliance with legal requirements and provide evidence of due diligence supporting an [[Information security management system|ISMS]] that can be certified. The scope can be an incident reporting plan, a [[business continuity plan]].

Another area of application can be the certification of a product.

Criteria include the risk evaluation, risk acceptance and impact evaluation criteria. These are conditioned by:&lt;ref name=ISO27005&gt;ISO/IEC, "Information technology -- Security techniques-Information security risk management" ISO/IEC FIDIS 27005:2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* legal and regulatory requirements
* the strategic value for the business of information processes
* [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]] expectations
* negative consequences for the reputation of the organization

Establishing the scope and boundaries, the organization should be studied: its mission, its values, its structure; its strategy, its locations and cultural environment. The constraints (budgetary, cultural, political, technical) of the organization are to be collected and documented as guide for next steps.

=== Organization for security management ===
The set up of the organization in charge of risk management is foreseen as partially fulfilling the requirement to provide the resources needed to establish, implement, operate, monitor, review, maintain and improve an ISMS.&lt;ref name=ISO27001&gt;ISO/IEC 27001&lt;/ref&gt; The main roles inside this organization are:&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;
* Senior Management
* [[Chief information officer]] (CIO)
* System and Information owners
* the business and functional managers
* the [[ISSO (IT)|Information System Security Officer]] (ISSO) or [[Chief information security officer]] (CISO)
* IT Security Practitioners
* Security Awareness Trainers

== Risk assessment ==
[[File:Octave like.jpg|thumb|ENISA: Risk assessment inside risk management]]
Risk Management is a recurrent activity that deals with the analysis, planning, implementation, control and monitoring of implemented measurements and the enforced security policy. On the contrary, Risk Assessment is executed at discrete time points (e.g. once a year, on demand, etc.) and – until the performance of the next assessment - provides a temporary view of assessed risks and while parameterizing the entire Risk Management process.
This view of the relationship of Risk Management to Risk Assessment is depicted in figure as adopted from OCTAVE.&lt;ref name=ENISAFULL/&gt;

Risk assessment is often conducted in more than one iteration, the first being a high-level assessment to identify high risks, while the other iterations detailed the analysis of the major risks and other risks.

According to [[National Information Assurance Training and Education Center]] risk assessment in the IT field is:&lt;ref name="NIATEC Glossary of terms"/&gt;
# ''A study of the vulnerabilities, threats, likelihood, loss or impact, and theoretical effectiveness of security measures. Managers use the results of a risk assessment to develop security requirements and specifications.''
# ''The process of evaluating threats and vulnerabilities, known and postulated, to determine expected loss and establish the degree of acceptability to system operations.''
# ''An identification of a specific ADP facility's assets, the threats to these assets, and the ADP facility's vulnerability to those threats.''
# An analysis of system assets and vulnerabilities to establish an expected loss from certain events based on estimated probabilities of the occurrence of those events. The purpose of a risk assessment is to determine if countermeasures are adequate to reduce the probability of loss or the impact of loss to an acceptable level. ''
#''A management tool which provides a systematic approach for determining the relative value and sensitivity of computer installation assets, assessing vulnerabilities, assessing loss expectancy or perceived risk exposure levels, assessing existing protection features and additional protection alternatives or acceptance of risks and documenting management decisions. Decisions for implementing additional protection features are normally based on the existence of a reasonable ratio between cost/benefit of the safeguard and sensitivity/value of the assets to be protected. Risk assessments may vary from an informal review of a small scale microcomputer installation to a more formal and fully documented analysis (i. e., risk analysis) of a large scale computer installation. Risk assessment methodologies may vary from qualitative or quantitative approaches to any combination of these two approaches.''

=== ISO 27005 framework ===
Risk assessment receives as input the output of the previous step [[#Context establishment|Context establishment]]; the output is the list of assessed risks prioritized according to risk evaluation criteria.

The [[ISO/IEC 17799|ISO/IEC 27002:2005]] Code of practice for information security management recommends the following be examined during a risk assessment:
*[[security policy]],
*[[organization]] of information security,
*[[asset management]],
*[[human resources]] security,
* [[physical security|physical]] and [[environmental security]],
*[[communications]] and operations management,
*[[access control]],
*information systems acquisition, development and maintenance, (see [[Systems Development Life Cycle]])
*information security [[incident management]],
* [[business continuity]] management, and
* [[regulatory compliance]].

==== Risk identification ====
[[File:2010-T10-ArchitectureDiagram.png|thumb|300px|OWASP: relationship between threat agent and business impact]]
Risk identification states what could cause a potential loss; the following are to be identified:&lt;ref name=ISO27005/&gt;
* [[asset (computing)|assets]], primary (i.e. Business processes and related information) and supporting (i.e. hardware, software, personnel, site, organization structure)
* [[Threat (computer)|threat]]s
* existing and planned security measures
* vulnerabilities
* consequence
* related business processes
The output of sub process is made up of:

* list of asset and related business processes to be risk managed with associated list of threats, existing and planned security measures
* list of vulnerabilities unrelated to any identified threats
* list of incident scenarios with their consequences.

==== Risk estimation ====
There are two methods of risk assessment in information security field, [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[Qualitative research|qualitative]].&lt;ref name="CISSP-Guide"&gt;{{cite book | title=Official (ISC)2 Guide to CISSP CBK | publisher=Auerbach Publications | year=2007 | pages=1065 | location=Risk Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purely quantitative risk assessment is a mathematical calculation based on security metrics on the [[asset (computing)|asset]] (system or application).
For each [[risk scenario]], taking into consideration the different [[risk factor (computing)|risk factors]] a [[Single loss expectancy]] (SLE) is determined. Then, considering the probability of occurrence on a given period basis, for example the annual rate of occurrence (ARO), the [[Annualized Loss Expectancy]] is determined as the product of ARO X SLE.&lt;ref name="Vacca"/&gt;
It is important to point out that the values of [[asset (computing)|assets]] to be considered are those of all involved assets, not only the value of the directly affected resource.&lt;br /&gt;
For example, if you consider the risk scenario of a Laptop theft threat, you should consider the value of the data (a related asset) contained in the computer and the reputation and liability of the company (other assets) deriving from the lost of availability and confidentiality of the data that could be involved.
It is easy to understand that [[intangible asset]]s (data, reputation, liability) can be worth much more than physical resources at risk (the laptop hardware in the example).&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2009-01-27/politics/va.data.theft_1_laptop-personal-data-single-veteran?_s=PM:POLITICS CNN article about a class action settlement for a Veteran Affair stolen laptop]&lt;/ref&gt;
Intangible asset value can be huge, but is not easy to evaluate: this can be a consideration against a pure quantitative approach.&lt;ref name=FAIR/&gt;

Qualitative risk assessment (three to five steps evaluation, from Very High to Low) is performed when the organization requires a risk assessment be performed in a relatively short time or to meet a small budget, a significant quantity of relevant data is not available, or the persons performing the assessment don't have the sophisticated mathematical, financial, and risk assessment expertise required.&lt;ref name="CISSP-Guide" /&gt; Qualitative risk assessment can be performed in a shorter period of time and with less data. Qualitative risk assessments are typically performed through interviews of a sample of personnel from all relevant groups within an organization charged with the security of the asset being assessed. Qualitative risk assessments are descriptive versus measurable.
Usually a qualitative classification is done followed by a quantitative evaluation of the highest risks to be compared to the costs of security measures.

Risk estimation has as input the output of risk analysis and can be split in the following steps:
* assessment of the consequences through the valuation of assets
* assessment of the likelihood of the incident (through threat and vulnerability valuation)
* assign values to the likelihood and consequence of the risks
The output is the list of risks with value levels assigned. It can be documented in a [[risk register]].

Risks arising from security threats and adversary attacks may be particularly difficult to estimate. This difficulty is made worse because, at least for any IT system connected to the Internet, any adversary with intent and capability may attack because physical closeness or access is not necessary. Some initial models have been proposed for this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Global adversarial capability modeling|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=7120797|journal = 2015 APWG Symposium on Electronic Crime Research (eCrime)|date = 2015-05-01|pages = 1–21|doi = 10.1109/ECRIME.2015.7120797|first = J.|last = Spring|first2 = S.|last2 = Kern|first3 = A.|last3 = Summers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During risk estimation there are generally three values of a given asset, one for the loss of one of the [[CIA triad|CIA]] properties: [[Information security|Confidentiality]], Integrity, [[Availability]].&lt;ref name="BS7799"&gt;British Standard Institute "ISMSs-Part 3: Guidelines for information security risk management" BS 7799-3:2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Risk evaluation ====
The risk evaluation process receives as input the output of risk analysis process. It compares each risk level against the risk acceptance criteria and prioritise the risk list with risk treatment indications.

=== NIST SP 800 30 framework ===
[[File:NIST SP 800-30 Figure 3-1.png|thumb|Risk assessment according NIST SP 800-30 Figure 3-1]]
To determine the likelihood of a future adverse event, [[threat (computer)|threat]]s to an IT system must be in conjunction with the potential [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] and the [[security controls|controls]] in place for the IT system.&lt;br /&gt;
Impact refers to the magnitude of harm that could be caused by a threat’s exercise of vulnerability. The level of impact is governed by the potential mission impacts and produces a relative value for the IT assets and resources affected (e.g., the criticality sensitivity of the IT system components and data). The risk assessment methodology encompasses nine primary steps:&lt;ref name=SP80030&gt;[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf NIST SP 800-30 Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Step 1 System Characterization
* Step 2 Threat Identification
* Step 3 Vulnerability Identification
* Step 4 Control Analysis
* Step 5 Likelihood Determination
* Step 6 Impact Analysis
* Step 7 Risk Determination
* Step 8 Control Recommendations
* Step 9 Results Documentation

== Risk mitigation ==
Risk mitigation, the second process according to SP 800-30, the third according to ISO 27005 of risk management, involves prioritizing, evaluating, and implementing the appropriate risk-reducing controls recommended from the risk assessment process.
Because the elimination of all risk is usually impractical or close to impossible, it is the responsibility of senior management and functional and business managers to use the least-cost approach and implement the most appropriate controls to decrease mission risk to an acceptable level, with minimal adverse impact on the organization’s resources and mission.

=== ISO 27005 framework ===
The risk treatment process aim at selecting security measures to:
* reduce
* retain
* avoid
* transfer
risk and produce a risk treatment plan, that is the output of the process with the residual risks subject to the acceptance of management.

There are some list to select appropriate security measures,&lt;ref name=ISO27001/&gt; but is up to the single organization to choose the most appropriate one according to its business strategy, constraints of the environment and circumstances. The choice should be rational and documented. The importance of accepting a risk that is too costly to reduce is very high and led to the fact that risk acceptance is considered a separate process.&lt;ref name=ISO27005/&gt;

Risk transfer apply were the risk has a very high impact but is not easy to reduce significantly the likelihood by means of security controls: the [[insurance]] premium should be compared against the mitigation costs, eventually evaluating some mixed strategy to partially treat the risk. Another option is to outsource the risk to somebody more efficient to manage the risk.&lt;ref&gt;Costas Lambrinoudakisa, Stefanos Gritzalisa, Petros Hatzopoulosb, Athanasios N. Yannacopoulosb, Sokratis Katsikasa, "A formal model for pricing information systems insurance contracts", Computer Standards &amp; Interfaces - Volume 27, Issue 5, June 2005, Pages 521-532 {{doi|10.1016/j.csi.2005.01.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Risk avoidance describe any action where ways of conducting business are changed to avoid any risk occurrence. For example, the choice of not storing sensitive information about customers can be an avoidance for the risk that customer data can be stolen.

The ''residual risks'', i.e. the risk remaining after risk treatment decision have been taken, should be estimated to ensure that sufficient protection is achieved. If the residual risk is unacceptable, the risk treatment process should be iterated.

=== NIST SP 800 30 framework ===
[[File:NIST SP 800-30 Figure 4-2.png|thumb|Risk mitigation methodology flow chart from NIST SP 800-30 Figure 4-2]]
[[File:NIST SP 800-30 Figure 4-1.png|thumb|Risk mitigation action point according to NIST SP 800-30 Figure 4-1]]
Risk mitigation is a systematic methodology used by senior management to reduce mission risk.&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Risk mitigation can be achieved through any of the following risk mitigation options:
* '''Risk Assumption'''. To accept the potential risk and continue operating the IT system or to implement controls to lower the risk to an acceptable level
* '''Risk Avoidance'''. To avoid the risk by eliminating the risk cause and/or consequence (e.g., forgo certain functions of the system or shut down the system when risks are identified)
* '''Risk Limitation'''. To limit the risk by implementing controls that minimize the adverse impact of a threat’s exercising a vulnerability (e.g., use of supporting, preventive, detective controls)
* '''Risk Planning'''. To manage risk by developing a risk mitigation plan that prioritizes, implements, and maintains controls
* ''' Research and Acknowledgement'''. To lower the risk of loss by acknowledging the vulnerability or flaw and researching controls to correct the vulnerability
* '''Risk Transference'''. To transfer the risk by using other options to compensate for the loss, such as purchasing insurance.
Address the greatest risks and strive for sufficient risk mitigation at the lowest cost, with minimal impact on other mission capabilities: this is the suggestion contained in&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;

== Risk communication ==
{{main article|Risk_management#Risk_communication}}
Risk communication is a horizontal process that interacts bidirectionally with all other processes of risk management. Its purpose is to establish a common understanding of all aspect of risk among all the organization's stakeholder. Establishing a common understanding is important, since it influences decisions to be taken. The Risk Reduction Overview method &lt;ref&gt;[http://rro.sourceforge.net RRO website]&lt;/ref&gt; is specifically designed for this process. It presents a comprehensible overview of the coherence of risks, measures and residual risks to achieve this common understanding.

== Risk monitoring and review ==
Risk management is an ongoing, never ending process. Within this process implemented security measures are regularly monitored and reviewed to ensure that they work as planned and that changes in the environment rendered them ineffective. Business requirements, vulnerabilities and threats can change over the time.

Regular audits should be scheduled and should be conducted by an independent party, i.e. somebody not under the control of whom is responsible for the implementations or daily management of [[Information security management system|ISMS]].

== IT evaluation and assessment ==
Security controls should be validated. Technical controls are possible complex systems that are to tested and verified. The hardest part to validate is people knowledge of procedural controls and the effectiveness of the real application in daily business of the security procedures.&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;

[[Vulnerability assessment (computing)|Vulnerability assessment]], both internal and external, and [[Penetration test]] are instruments for verifying the status of security controls.

[[Information technology security audit]] is an organizational and procedural control with the aim of evaluating security.
The IT systems of most organization are evolving quite rapidly. Risk management should cope with these changes through change authorization after risk re evaluation of the affected systems and processes and periodically review the risks and mitigation actions.&lt;ref name=Vacca/&gt;

Monitoring system events according to a security monitoring strategy, an incident response plan and security validation and metrics are fundamental activities to assure that an optimal level of security is obtained.&lt;br /&gt;
It is important to monitor the new vulnerabilities, apply procedural and technical security controls like regularly [[Patch (computing)|updating software]], and evaluate other kinds of controls to deal with [[zero-day attack]]s.

The attitude of involved people to [[benchmarking|benchmark]] against [[best practice]] and follow the seminars of [[professional association]]s in the sector are factors to assure the state of art of an organization IT risk management practice.

== Integrating risk management into system development life cycle ==
Effective risk management must be totally integrated into the [[Systems Development Life Cycle|SDLC]]. An IT system’s SDLC has five phases: initiation, development or acquisition, implementation, operation or maintenance, and disposal. The risk management methodology is the same regardless of the SDLC phase for which the assessment is being conducted. Risk management is an iterative process that can be performed during each major phase of the SDLC.&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;
{|class="wikitable"
|+ align="center" |'''Table 2-1 Integration of Risk Management into the SDLC'''&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;
|-
! SDLC Phases!!Phase Characteristics!!Support from Risk Management Activities
|-
| Phase 1: Initiation||The need for an IT system is expressed and the purpose and scope of the IT system is documented||Identified risks are used to support the development of the system requirements, including security requirements, and a security concept of operations (strategy)
|-
| style=white-space:nowrap| Phase 2: Development or Acquisition||The IT system is designed, purchased, programmed, developed, or otherwise constructed||The risks identified during this phase can be used to support the security analyses of the IT system that may lead to architecture and design tradeoffs during system development
|-
| Phase 3: Implementation||The system security features should be configured, enabled, tested, and verified||The risk management process supports the assessment of the system implementation against its requirements and within its modeled operational environment. Decisions regarding risks identified must be made prior to system operation
|-
| style=white-space:nowrap|Phase 4: Operation or Maintenance||The system performs its functions. Typically the system is being modified on an ongoing basis through the addition of hardware and software and by changes to organizational processes, policies, and procedures||Risk management activities are performed for periodic system reauthorization (or reaccreditation) or whenever major changes are made to an IT system in its operational, production environment (e.g., new system interfaces)
|-
| Phase 5: Disposal||This phase may involve the disposition of information, hardware, and software. Activities may include moving, archiving, discarding, or destroying information and sanitizing the hardware and software||Risk management activities are performed for system components that will be disposed of or replaced to ensure that the hardware and software are properly disposed of, that residual data is appropriately handled, and that system migration is conducted in a secure and systematic manner

[[NIST]] SP 800-64&lt;ref name=NIST80064&gt;[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-64-Rev2/SP800-64-Revision2.pdf 800-64 NIST Security Considerations in the Information System Development Life Cycle]&lt;/ref&gt; is devoted to this topic.

Early integration of security in the SDLC enables agencies to maximize return on investment in their security programs, through:&lt;ref name=NIST80064/&gt;
* Early identification and mitigation of security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, resulting in lower cost of security control implementation and vulnerability mitigation;
* Awareness of potential engineering challenges caused by mandatory security controls;
* Identification of shared [[Security service (telecommunication)|security services]] and reuse of security strategies and tools to reduce development cost and schedule while improving security posture through proven methods and techniques; and
* Facilitation of informed executive decision making through comprehensive risk management in a timely manner.
This guide&lt;ref name=NIST80064/&gt; focuses on the information security components of the SDLC. First, descriptions of the key security roles and responsibilities that are needed in most information system developments are provided. Second, sufficient information about the SDLC is provided to allow a person who is unfamiliar with the SDLC process to understand the relationship between information security and the SDLC.
The document integrates the security steps into the linear, sequential (a.k.a. waterfall) SDLC. The five-step SDLC cited in the document is an example of one method of development and is not intended to mandate this methodology.
Lastly, SP 800-64 provides insight into IT projects and initiatives that are not as clearly defined as SDLC-based developments, such as service-oriented architectures, cross-organization projects, and IT facility developments.

Security can be incorporated into information systems acquisition, development and maintenance by implementing effective security practices in the following areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.internet2.edu/confluence/display/itsg2/Information+Systems+Acquisition%2C+Development%2C+and+Maintenance+%28ISO+12%29 EDUCAUSE Dashboard ISO 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Security requirements for information systems
* Correct processing in applications
* Cryptographic controls
* Security of system files
* Security in development and support processes
* Technical vulnerability management

Information systems security begins with incorporating security into the requirements process for any new application or system enhancement. Security should be designed into the system from the beginning. Security requirements are presented to the vendor during the requirements phase of a product purchase. Formal testing should be done to determine whether the product meets the required security specifications prior to purchasing the product.

Correct processing in applications is essential in order to prevent errors and to mitigate loss, unauthorized modification or misuse of information. Effective coding techniques include validating input and output data, protecting message integrity using encryption, checking for processing errors, and creating activity logs.

Applied properly, cryptographic controls provide effective mechanisms for protecting the confidentiality, authenticity and integrity of information. An institution should develop policies on the use of encryption, including proper key management. Disk Encryption is one way to protect data at rest. Data in transit can be protected from alteration and unauthorized viewing using SSL certificates issued through a Certificate Authority that has implemented a Public Key Infrastructure.

System files used by applications must be protected in order to ensure the integrity and stability of the application. Using source code repositories with version control, extensive testing, production back-off plans, and appropriate access to program code are some effective measures that can be used to protect an application's files.

Security in development and support processes is an essential part of a comprehensive quality assurance and production control process, and would usually involve training and continuous oversight by the most experienced staff.

Applications need to be monitored and patched for technical vulnerabilities. Procedures for applying patches should include evaluating the patches to determine their appropriateness, and whether or not they can be successfully removed in case of a negative impact.

== Critique of risk management as a methodology ==
Risk management as a scientific methodology has been criticized as being shallow.&lt;ref name=Vacca1/&gt; Major IT risk management programmes for large organizations, such as mandated by the US [[FISMA#Critique|Federal Information Security Management Act]], have been criticized.

By avoiding the complexity that accompanies the formal probabilistic model of risks and uncertainty, risk management looks more like a process that attempts to guess rather than formally predict the future on the basis of statistical evidence. It is highly subjective in assessing the value of assets, the likelihood of threats occurrence and the significance of the impact.

However, a better way to deal with the subject has not emerged.&lt;ref name=Vacca1/&gt;

== Risk managements methods ==

It is quite hard to list most of the methods that at least partially support the IT risk management process. Efforts in this direction were done by:
* [[NIST]] Description of Automated Risk Management Packages That NIST/NCSC Risk Management Research Laboratory Has Examined, updated 1991
* [[ENISA]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enisa.europa.eu/act/rm/cr/risk-management-inventory/rm-ra-methods ENISA, Inventory of Risk Management / Risk Assessment Methods]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006; a list of methods and tools is available on line with a comparison engine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rm-inv.enisa.europa.eu/rm_ra_methods.html Inventory of Risk Management / Risk Assessment Methods]&lt;/ref&gt; Among them the most widely used are:&lt;ref name=Vacca1/&gt;
** [[CRAMM]] Developed by British government is compliant to [[ISO/IEC 17799]], [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] (GLBA) and [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA)
** [[EBIOS]] developed by the French government it is compliant with major security standards: [[ISO/IEC 27001]], ISO/IEC 13335, [[ISO/IEC 15408]], [[ISO/IEC 17799]] and ISO/IEC 21287
** [[Standard of Good Practice]] developed by [[Information Security Forum]] (ISF)
** [[Mehari]] developed by [https://www.clusif.asso.fr/ Clusif Club de la Sécurité de l'Information Français]
** TIK IT Risk Framework developed by [http://itriskinstitute.com/ IT Risk Institute]
** Octave developed by Carnegie Mellon University, SEI ([[Software Engineering Institute]]) The Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability EvaluationSM (OCTAVE) approach defines a risk-based strategic assessment and planning technique for security.
** [[IT Baseline Protection Catalogs|IT-Grundschutz]] (IT Baseline Protection Manual) developed by Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) (Germany); IT-Grundschutz provides a method for an organization to establish an Information Security Management System (ISMS). It comprises both generic IT security recommendations for establishing an applicable IT security process and detailed technical recommendations to achieve the necessary IT security level for a specific domain
Enisa report&lt;ref name=ENISAFULL/&gt; classified the different methods regarding completeness, free availability, tool support; the result is that:
* EBIOS, ISF methods, IT-Grundschutz cover deeply all the aspects (Risk Identification, Risk analysis, Risk evaluation, Risk assessment, Risk treatment, Risk acceptance, Risk communication),
* EBIOS and IT-Grundschutz are the only ones freely available and
* only EBIOS has an open source tool to support it.

The [[Factor Analysis of Information Risk]] (FAIR) main document, "An Introduction to Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR)", Risk Management Insight LLC, November 2006;&lt;ref name=FAIR&gt;,[http://www.riskmanagementinsight.com/media/docs/FAIR_introduction.pdf "An Introduction to Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR)", Risk Management Insight LLC, November 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141118061526/http://www.riskmanagementinsight.com/media/docs/FAIR_introduction.pdf |date=2014-11-18 }};&lt;/ref&gt;
outline that most of the methods above lack of rigorous definition of risk and its factors. FAIR is not another methodology to deal with risk management, but it complements existing methodologies.&lt;ref name=OGC081&gt;Technical Standard Risk Taxonomy {{ISBN|1-931624-77-1}} Document Number: C081 Published by The Open Group, January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

FAIR has had a good acceptance, mainly by [[The Open Group]] and [[ISACA]].

ISACA developed a methodology, called [[Risk IT]], to address various kind of IT related risks, chiefly security related risks. It is integrated with [[COBIT]], a general framework to manage IT.
Risk IT has a broader concept of [[IT risk]] than other methodologies, it encompasses not just only the negative [[impact (security)|impact]] of operations and service delivery which can bring destruction or reduction of the value of the organization, but also the benefit\value enabling risk associated to missing opportunities to use technology to enable or enhance business or the IT project management for aspects like overspending or late delivery with adverse business impact.&lt;ref name=RISKITW/&gt;

The "''Build Security In''" initiative of [[Homeland Security Department]] of United States, cites FAIR.&lt;ref&gt;https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/bsi/articles/best-practices/deployment/583-BSI.html&lt;/ref&gt;
The initiative Build Security In is a collaborative effort that provides practices, tools, guidelines, rules, principles, and other resources that software developers, architects, and security practitioners can use to build security into software in every phase of its development. So it chiefly address [[Secure coding]].

In 2016, Threat Sketch launched an abbreviated cyber security risk assessment specifically for small organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hub.innovationquarter.com/2016/10/05/a-start-up-grows-up-in-the-innovation-quarter/|title=Threat Sketch: A Start-up Grows Up in the Innovation Quarter|date=2016-10-05|website=Innovation Quarter Hub|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.twcnews.com/nc/triad/news/2016/11/11/entrepreneurs-share-business-ideas-on-startup-weekend.html|title=Triad Entrepreneurs Share Business Ideas on Startup Weekend|newspaper=TWC News|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methodology uses [[Real options valuation|real options]] to forecast and prioritize a fixed list of high-level threats.

[[File:Aloe hereroensis Auob C15.JPG|thumb|''[[Aloe hereroensis]]'', showing inflorescence with branched [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncle]]]]

An '''inflorescence''' is a group or cluster of [[flower]]s arranged on a [[Plant stem|stem]] that is composed of a main [[branch]] or a complicated arrangement of branches. [[Morphology (biology)|Morphologically]], it is the modified part of the [[shoot]] of [[spermatophytes|seed plants]] where [[flower]]s are formed. The modifications can involve the length and the nature of the [[internode (botany)|internode]]s and the [[phyllotaxis]], as well as variations in the proportions, compressions, swellings, [[adnation]]s, [[connation]]s and reduction of main and secondary axes.
Inflorescence can also be defined as the reproductive portion of a plant that bears a cluster of flowers in a specific pattern.

The stem holding the whole inflorescence is called a [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncle]] and the major axis (incorrectly referred to as the main stem) holding the flowers or more branches within the inflorescence is called the '''[[rachis]]'''.  The stalk of each single flower is called a [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]]. A flower that is not part of an inflorescence is called a solitary flower and its stalk is also referred to as a peduncle. Any flower in an inflorescence may be referred to as a '''floret''', especially when the individual flowers are particularly small and borne in a tight cluster, such as in a [[pseudanthium]].
The [[fruit]]ing stage of an inflorescence is known as an [[infructescence]].

Inflorescences may be simple (single) or complex ([[panicle]]). The rachis may be one of several types, including single, composite, umbel, spike or [[raceme]].

==General characteristics==
Inflorescences are described by many different characteristics including how the flowers are arranged on the peduncle, the blooming order of the flowers and how different clusters of flowers are grouped within it. These terms are general representations as plants in nature can have a combination of types.

===Bracts===
Inflorescences usually have modified shoots foliage different from the [[vegetation|vegetative]] part of the plant. Considering the broadest meaning of the term, any leaf associated with an inflorescence is called a '''[[bract]]'''&lt;!--- This broad definition of bract is required to keep consistency within the article ---&gt;. A bract is usually located at the node where the main stem of the inflorescence forms, joined to the main stem of the plant, but other bracts can exist within the inflorescence itself. They serve a variety of functions which include attracting pollinators and protecting young flowers. According to the presence or absence of bracts and their characteristics we can distinguish:
* '''Ebracteate inflorescences''': No bracts in the inflorescence.
* '''Bracteate inflorescences''': The bracts in the inflorescence are very specialised, sometimes reduced to small scales, divided or dissected.
* '''Leafy inflorescences''': Though often reduced in size, the bracts are unspecialised and look like the typical leaves of the plant, so that the term '''flowering stem''' is usually applied instead of inflorescence. This use is not technically correct, as, despite their  'normal' appearance, these ''leaves'' are considered, in fact, ''bracts'', so that 'leafy inflorescence' is preferable.
* '''Leafy-bracted inflorescences''': Intermediate between bracteate and leafy inflorescence.

If many bracts are present and they are strictly connected to the stem, like in the family [[Asteraceae]], the bracts might collectively be called an '''involucre'''. If the inflorescence has a second unit of bracts further up the stem, they might be called an '''involucel'''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Terminal flower===
Plant organs can grow according to two different schemes, namely [[monopodial]] or '''[[racemose]]''' and [[sympodial]] or '''cymose'''. In inflorescences these two different growth patterns are called [[Indeterminate growth|indeterminate]] and determinate respectively, and indicate whether a terminal flower is formed and where flowering starts within the inflorescence.
* '''Indeterminate inflorescence''': [[Monopodial]] (racemose) growth. The terminal bud keeps growing and forming lateral flowers. A terminal flower is never formed. 
* '''Determinate inflorescence''': [[Sympodial]] (cymose) growth. The terminal bud forms a terminal flower and then dies out. Other flowers then grow from lateral buds.

Indeterminate and determinate inflorescences are sometimes referred to as '''open''' and '''closed''' inflorescences respectively. The indeterminate patterning of flowers is derived from determinate flowers. It is suggested that indeterminate flowers have a common mechanism that prevents terminal flower growth. Based on phylogenetic analyses, this mechanism arose independently multiple times in different species.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradley|first=Desmond|last2=Ratcliffe|first2=Oliver|last3=Vincent|first3=Coral|last4=Carpenter|first4=Rosemary|last5=Coen|first5=Enrico|date=1997-01-03|title=Inflorescence Commitment and Architecture in Arabidopsis|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/275/5296/80|journal=Science|language=en|volume=275|issue=5296|pages=80–83|doi=10.1126/science.275.5296.80|issn=0036-8075|pmid=8974397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an '''indeterminate inflorescence''' there is no true terminal flower and the stem usually has a rudimentary end. In many cases the last true flower formed by the terminal bud ('''subterminal''' flower) straightens up, appearing to be a terminal flower. Often a vestige of the terminal bud may be noticed higher on the stem.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Offener_Blütenstand_(inflorescence).svg|Indeterminate inflorescence with a perfect acropetal maturation.
Image:Offener_Blütenstand_(inflorescence)_m_K.svg|Indeterminate inflorescence with an acropetal maturation and lateral flower buds.
Image:Pseudoterminalbluete (inflorescence).svg|Indeterminate inflorescence with the subterminal flower to simulate the terminal one (vestige present)
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In '''determinate inflorescences''' the terminal flower is usually the first to mature (precursive development), while the others tend to mature starting from the bottom of the stem. This pattern is called '''acropetal''' maturation. When flowers start to mature from the top of the stem, maturation is '''[[basipetal]]''', while when the central mature first, '''divergent'''.

&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:Basipetale effloration (inflorescence).svg|Determinate inflorescence with basipetal maturation
Image:Divergente effloration (inflorescence).svg|Determinate inflorescence with divergent maturation
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Phyllotaxis===
As with [[leaf|leaves]], flowers can be arranged on the stem according to many different patterns. See '[[Phyllotaxis]]' for in-depth descriptions

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Inflorescences Raceme Kwiatostan Grono.svg|Alternate flowers
Image:Traube dekussiert (inflorescence).svg|Opposite flowers
&lt;/gallery&gt; 
Similarly arrangement of leaf in bud is called Ptyxis.

===Metatopy===
Metatopy is the placement of organs out of their normally expected position: typically metatopy occurs in inflorescences when unequal growth rates alter different areas of the axis and the organs attached to the axis.

When a single or a cluster of flower(s) is located at the axil of a bract, the location of the bract in relation to the stem holding the flower(s) is indicated by the use of different terms and may be a useful diagnostic indicator.

Typical placement of bracts include:
* Some plants have bracts that subtend the inflorescence, where the flowers are on branched stalks; the bracts are not connected to the stalks holding the flowers, but are [[adnation|adnate]] or attached to the main stem (Adnate describes the fusing together of different unrelated parts. When the parts fused together are the same, they are connately joined.)
* Other plants have the bracts subtend  the [[pedicel (botany)|pedicel]] or peduncle of single flowers.

Metatopic placement of bracts include:
* When the bract is attached to the stem holding the flower (the pedicel or peduncle), it is said to be '''recaulescent'''; sometimes these bracts or bracteoles are highly modified and appear to be appendages of the flower calyx. Recaulescences is the fusion of the subtending leaf with the stem holding the bud or the bud itself,&lt;ref&gt;Kubitzki, Klaus, and Clemens Bayer. 2002. ''Flowering plants, Dicotyledons: Malvales, Capparales, and non-betalain Caryophyllales. The Families and genera of vascular plants, 5.'' Berlin: Springer. p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; thus the leaf or bract is adnate to the stem of flower.
*  When the formation of the bud is shifted up the stem distinctly above the subtending leaf, it is described as '''concaulescent'''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Organization==
There is no general consensus in defining the different inflorescences. The following is based on [[Focko Weberling]]'s ''Morphologie der Blüten und der Blütenstände'' (Stuttgart, 1981). The main groups of inflorescences are distinguished by branching. Within these groups, the most important characteristics are the intersection of the axes and different variations of the model. They may contain many flowers ('''pluriflor''') or a few ('''pauciflor'''). Inflorescences can be '''simple''' or '''compound'''.

===Simple inflorescences===
[[File:Sunflower macro wide.jpg|thumb|Inflorescence of sessile disc florets forming the [[Head (botany)|capitulum]]]]

====Indeterminate or racemose====
Indeterminate simple inflorescences are generally called '''racemose''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|æ|s|ᵻ|m|oʊ|s}}. The main kind of racemose inflorescence is the '''raceme''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|æ|s|iː|m}}, from classical Latin ''racemus'', cluster of grapes).&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary. Raceme 2. Bot. A type of inflorescence in which the flowers are arranged on short, nearly equal, lateral pedicels, at equal distances along a single elongated axis&lt;/ref&gt; The other kind of racemose inflorescences can all be derived from this one by dilation, compression, swelling or reduction of the different axes. Some passage forms between the obvious ones are commonly admitted.
* A '''[[raceme]]''' is an unbranched, [[indeterminate growth|indeterminate]] inflorescence with pedicellate (having short floral stalks) flowers along the axis.
* A '''[[raceme|spike]]''' is a type of raceme with flowers that do not have a pedicel.
* A racemose '''[[corymb]]''' is an unbranched, indeterminate inflorescence that is flat-topped or convex due to their outer pedicels which are progressively longer than inner ones.
* An '''[[umbel]]''' is a type of raceme with a short axis and multiple floral pedicels of equal length that appear to arise from a common point.
* A '''[[spadix (botany)|spadix]]''' is a spike of flowers densely arranged around it, enclosed or accompanied by a highly specialised bract called a '''[[spadix (botany)|spathe]]'''. It is characteristic of the family [[Araceae]].
* A '''[[Pseudanthium|flower head]]''' or '''capitulum''' is a very contracted raceme in which the single sessile flowers share are borne on an enlarged stem. It is characteristic of [[Dipsacaceae]].
* A '''[[catkin]]''' or '''ament''' is a scaly, generally drooping spike or raceme. Cymose or other complex inflorescences that are superficially similar are also generally called thus.

Image:Alnus incana rugosa catkin.jpg|''[[Alnus incana]]'' (ament)
&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Determinate or cymose====
Determinate simple inflorescences are generally called '''cymose'''. The main kind of cymose inflorescence is the '''cyme''' (pronounced 'saim', from the Latin ''cyma'' in the sense ‘cabbage sprout’, from Greek ''kuma'' ‘anything swollen’&lt;ref&gt;Collins English Dictionary. 8th Edition first published in 2006&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary. Cyme(1) Bot. A species of inflorescence wherein the primary axis bears a single terminal flower which develops first, the system being continued by axes of secondary and higher orders which develop successively in like manner; a centrifugal or definite
inflorescence: opposed to [[Raceme]]. Applied esp. to compound inflorescences of this type forming a more or less flat head.&lt;/ref&gt; Cymes are further divided according to this scheme:
* Only one secondary axis: '''monochasium'''
** Secondary buds always develop on the same side of the stem: '''helicoid cyme'''    or '''bostryx'''
*** The successive pedicels are aligned on the same plane: '''drepanium'''
** Secondary buds develop alternately on the stem : '''scorpioid cyme'''
*** The successive pedicels are arranged in a sort of spiral: '''cincinnus''' (characteristic of the [[Boraginaceae]] and [[Commelinaceae]])
*** The successive pedicels follow a zig-zag path on the same plane: '''rhipidium''' (many [[Iridaceae]])
* Two secondary axes: '''dichasial cyme'''
** Secondary axis still dichasial: '''dichasium''' (characteristic of [[Caryophyllaceae]])
** Secondary axis monochasia: '''double scorpioid cyme''' or '''double helicoid cyme'''
* More than two secondary axes: '''pleiochasium'''

&lt;/gallery&gt;

A cyme can also be so compressed that it looks like an umbel. Strictly speaking this kind of inflorescence could be called '''umbelliform cyme''', although it is normally called simply 'umbel'.

Another kind of definite simple inflorescence is the raceme-like cyme or '''botryoid'''; that is as a raceme with a terminal flower and is usually improperly called 'raceme'.

&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:Berberis vernae MS 4426.jpg|''Berberis vernae'' (botryoid)
&lt;/gallery&gt;

A reduced raceme or cyme that grows in the [[axil]] of a bract is called a '''fascicle'''. A '''verticillaster''' is a fascicle with the structure of a dichasium; it is common among the [[Lamiaceae]]. Many verticillasters with reduced bracts can form a spicate (spike-like) inflorescence that is commonly called a '''spike'''.

Image:Mentha longifolia 2005.08.02 09.53.56.jpg|''[[Mentha longifolia]]'' ('spike')
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Compound inflorescences===
Simple inflorescences are the basis for compound inflorescences or '''synflorescences'''. The single flowers are there replaced by a simple inflorescence, which can be both a racemose or a cymose one. Compound inflorescences are composed of branched stems and can involve complicated arrangements that are difficult to trace back to the main branch.

A kind of compound inflorescence is the '''double inflorescence''', in which the basic structure is repeated in the place of single florets. For example, a double raceme is a raceme in which the single flowers are replaced by other simple racemes; the same structure can be repeated to form triple or more complex structures.

Compound raceme inflorescences can either end with a final raceme ('''homoeothetic'''), or not ('''heterothetic'''). A compound raceme is often called a '''panicle'''. Note that this definition is very different from that given by [[Focko Weberling|Weberling]].

Compound umbels are umbels in which the single flowers are replaced by many smaller umbels called '''umbellets'''. The stem attaching the side umbellets to the main stem is called a '''ray'''.

&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:Laserpitium latifolium2.jpg|''[[Laserpicium latifolium]]'' (double umbel)
Image:Dreifachdolde_(inflorescence).svg|Compound (triple) umbel
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The most common kind of definite compound inflorescence is the '''panicle''' (of Webeling, or 'panicle-like cyme'). A panicle is a definite inflorescence that is increasingly more strongly and irregularly branched from the top to the bottom and where each branching has a terminal flower.

The so-called cymose '''corymb''' is similar to a racemose corymb but has a panicle-like structure. Another type of panicle is the '''anthela'''. An anthela is a cymose corymb with the lateral flowers higher than the central ones.

Image:Spirre (inflorescence).svg|Anthela
Image:Juncus inflexus.jpeg|''[[Juncus inflexus]]'' (anthela)
&lt;/gallery&gt;

A raceme in which the single flowers are replaced by cymes is called a (indefinite) '''thyrse'''. The secondary cymes can be of any of the different types of dichasia and monochasia. A botryoid in which the single flowers are replaced by cymes is a '''definite thyrse''' or '''thyrsoid'''. Thyrses are often confusingly called '''panicles'''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Other combinations are possible. For example, heads or umbels may be arranged in a corymb or a panicle.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Other===
The family [[Asteraceae]] is characterised by a highly specialised head technically called a '''[[calathid]]''' (but usually referred to as 'capitulum' or 'head'). The family [[Poaceae]] has a peculiar inflorescence of small spikes ('''[[spikelet]]s''') organised in panicles or spikes that are usually simply and improperly referred to as '''spike''' and '''panicle'''. The genus ''[[Ficus]]'' ([[Moraceae]]) has an inflorescence called '''[[syconium]]''' and the genus ''[[Euphorbia]]'' has '''[[cyathium|cyathia]]''' (sing. ''cyathium''), usually organised in umbels.

== Development and patterning ==

===Development===
====Genetic basis====
Genes that shape inflorescence development have been studied at great length in ''[[Arabidopsis]]''. ''LEAFY'' (LFY) is a gene that promotes [[Meristem|floral meristem]] identity, regulating inflorescence development in ''Arabidopsis.''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shannon|first=S.|last2=Meeks-Wagner|first2=D.

Mutations in LFY, AP1, and similar promoting genes can cause conversion of flowers into shoots.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In contrast to LEAFY, genes like ''terminal flower'' (TFL) support the activity of an inhibitor that prevents flowers from growing on the inflorescence apex (flower primordium initiation), maintaining inflorescence meristem identity.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alvarez|first=John|last2=Guli|first2=Catherine L.|last3=Yu|first3=Xiang-Hua|last4=Smyth|first4=David R.|date=1992-01-01|title=terminal flower: a gene affecting inflorescence development in Arabidopsis thaliana|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-313X.1992.00103.x/abstract|journal=The Plant Journal|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=103–116|doi=10.1111/j.1365-313X.1992.00103.x|issn=1365-313X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both types of genes help shape flower development in accordance with the [[ABC model of flower development]]. Studies have been recently conducted or are ongoing for homologs of these genes in other flower species.

Inflorescence-feeding insect herbivores shape inflorescences by reducing lifetime fitness (how much flowering occurs), seed production by the inflorescences, and plant density, among other traits.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Louda|first=Svata M.|last2=Potvin|first2=Martha A.|date=1995-01-01|title=Effect of Inflorescence-Feeding Insects on the Demography and Lifetime of a Native Plant|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2307/1940645/abstract|journal=Ecology|language=en|volume=76|issue=1|pages=229–245|doi=10.2307/1940645|issn=1939-9170}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of this herbivory, inflorescences usually produce more flower heads and seeds.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Temperature can also variably shape inflorescence development. High temperatures can impair the proper development of flower buds or delay bud development in certain species, while in others, an increase in temperature can hasten inflorescence development.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moss|first=G|date=27 November 2015|title=Influence of Temperature and Photoperiod on Flower Induction and Inflorescence Development in Sweet Orange (Citrus Sinensis L.

===Meristems and inflorescence architecture===
The shift from the vegetative to reproductive phase of a flower involves the development of an inflorescence meristem that generates floral meristems.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Souer|first=E.|last2=Krol|first2=A. van der|last3=Kloos|first3=D.|last4=Spelt|first4=C.|last5=Bliek|first5=M.|last6=Mol|first6=J.|last7=Koes|first7=R.|date=1998-02-15|title=Genetic control of branching pattern and floral identity during Petunia inflorescence development|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/125/4/733|journal=Development|language=en|volume=125|issue=4|pages=733–742|issn=0950-1991|pmid=9435293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plant inflorescence architecture depends on which meristems becomes flowers and which become shoots.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benlloch|first=R.|last2=Berbel|first2=A.|last3=Serrano-Mislata|first3=A.|last4=Madueno|first4=F.|date=2007-09-01|title=Floral Initiation and Inflorescence Architecture: A Comparative View|url=https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/100/3/659/166081|journal=Annals of Botany|language=en|volume=100|issue=3|pages=659–676|doi=10.1093/aob/mcm146|issn=0305-7364|pmc=2759223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, genes that regulate floral meristem identity play major roles in determining inflorescence architecture because their expression domain will direct where the plant's flowers are formed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On a larger scale, inflorescence architecture affects the quality and quantity of offspring from selfing and outcrossing, as the architecture can influence pollination success. For example, ''[[Asclepias]]'' inflorescences have been shown to have an upper size limit, shaped by self-pollination levels due to crosses between inflorescences on the same plant or between flowers on the same inflorescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=WYATT|first=ROBERT|date=1980-05-01|title=THE REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY OF ASCLEPIAS TUBEROSA: I.

== Issues with inflorescence identification ==
Some species have flower and inflorescence intermediates. In these cases, some reproductive structures of certain flowers appear as transitional between inflorescences and flowers, making it difficult to accurately categorize and identify the structure as one or the other. For example, the genus ''Potamogeton'' of the family Potamogetonaceae are considered to have inflorescences that appear like an individual flower.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tucker|first=Shirley C.|last2=Grimes|first2=James|date=1999-10-01|title=The inflorescence: Introduction|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02857752|journal=The Botanical Review|language=en|volume=65|issue=4|pages=303–316|doi=10.1007/BF02857752|issn=0006-8101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13194">'''Interior design psychology''' is a field within [[environmental psychology]], which concerns the environmental conditions of the interior. It is a direct study of the relationship between an environment and how that environment affects the behaviour of its inhabitants, with the aim of maximising the positive affects of this relationship.
Through [[interior design]] psychology the performance and efficiency of the space and the wellbeing of the individual are improved. Figures like [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[John B. Calhoun]] and [[Jean Baudrillard]] have shown that by incorporating this psychology into design one can control an environment and to an extent, the relationship and behaviour of its inhabitants. An example of this is seen through the rat experiments conducted by Calhoun in which he noted the aggression, killing and changed sexual tendencies amongst rats. This experiment created a stark behavioural analogy between the rat’s behaviour and inhabitation in high-rise building projects in the US after WWII, an example of which is the Pruitt-Igoe development in St Louis demolished in 1972 only 21 years after being erected.

==Proxemics==

Proxemics study the amount of space people feel necessary to have between themselves and others. 
Crowding and Personal Space
In this field of study the phenomenon of territoriality is demonstrated continuously through unwritten indices and behaviours, which communicate, the conscious or subconscious notions of personal space and territoriality. This phenomenon is seen, for example, through the use of public seating and the empty seats on a crowded bus or train. 
“ Crowding occurs when the regulation of social interaction is unsuccessful and our desires for social interaction are exceeded by the actual amount of social interaction experienced.”&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=G.W.|author2=R.E. Wener|title=Crowding and personal space invasion on the train: Please don’t make me sit in the middle|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|year=2007|volume=27|pages=90–94|doi=10.1016/j.jenvp.2006.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Studies observing social behaviours and psychology have indicated, such as in the case for commuters that people will seek to maximise personal space whether standing or sitting.

In a study conducted by Gary W. Evans and Richard E. Wene, (who work within the field of environmental design and human development) of 139 adult commuters, commuting between New Jersey and Manhattan, (54% male) saliva samples were taken to measure cortisol levels, a hormonal marker of stress. Their research accounts statistically for other possible stressors such as income and general life stress. 
“We find that a more proximal index of density is correlated with multiple indices of stress wherein a more distal index of density is not.”&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; 
Concerns arising from the results of this study suggest that small deviations in increased seat density, controlled against income stress, would elevate the log of cortisol (i.e. stress levels) and diminish task performance and mood.

=== Relationships between People ===
Closely related to the proxemics of space, in the area of privacy. In “Perspectives on Privacy” P. Brierley Newell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brierley Newell|first=P.|title=Perspectives on Privacy|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|year=1995|volume=15|pages=87–104|doi=10.1016/0272-4944(95)90018-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  from the department of psychology at the University of Warwick, Coventry defines privacy as ‘a voluntary and temporary condition of separation from the public domain.’ The desire for privacy is often identified as a link between stress and distress. The ability to obtain privacy within an environment allows the individual to separate themselves physically and mentally from others and relax. This notion is of key importance in determining the behaviour and wellbeing of the individual. As above in the scenario of crowding and density on public transport, privacy dictates perception of comfort, in relation to crowding and personal space. Dissatisfaction with one’s environment can be related to the close proximity with others, leading to stress and as a result diminish mood and performance behaviours..

=== Defensible Space ===
This theory began development in 1962 when John B. Calhoun conducted a series of experiments on rats to study population density and social pathology. From these experiments a breeding utopia was established for the rats in which they only lacked space.  
“Unwanted social contact occurred with increasing frequency, leading to increased stress and aggression. Following the work of the physiologist, Hans Selye, it seemed that the adrenal system offered the standard binary solution: fight or flight. But in the sealed enclosure, flight was impossible. Violence quickly spiralled out of control. Cannibalism and infanticide followed. Males became hypersexual, pansexual and, an increasing proportion, homosexual. Calhoun called this vortex “a behavioural sink”. Their numbers fell into terminal decline and the population tailed off to extinction”&lt;ref name="Ramsden"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramsden|first=E.|title=The Urban Animal: population density and social pathology in rodents and humans|journal=World Health Organisation Bulletin|year=2009|volume=87|pages=82|doi=10.2471/blt.09.062836|pmc=2636191}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

This study linked population growth, environmental degradation and urban violence.&lt;ref name="Ramsden"/&gt;  Similar behavioural tendencies became apparent within the poor housing conditions at the Pruitt-Igoe development in St Louis. This development is now used as a key study of inhabitation by architects and urban planners, Oscar Newman one of the main developers of this field, references the observations of inhabitation at this establishment in his book ''Creating Defensible Space''.&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=O|title=Creating Defensible Space|year=1996|publisher=US Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Policy Development and Research|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes the stark difference between private space, which is clearly defined personal territory, and the public space in this development. He notes that public spaces shared by relatively few families compared to those shared by many were much more hygienic and well-looked after, whereas those shared by larger numbers were often vandalized and unhygienic. He comments that the anonymity created by these largely shared public corridors and spaces “evoked no feelings of identity or control”&lt;ref name="Newman"/&gt;  This indicates our relationship with space affects our behaviour and use of space. In this example lack of feelings of ownership of the space led to negative behaviour within space and furthermore created a feedback with negative effects on the wellbeing of the inhabitants.

== The Perception of Space ==
This perception can otherwise be termed as awareness between our bodies and the awareness of other bodies, organisms and bodies around us. Perceived beauty and personal involvement within an environment are key factors, which determine our perception of space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Osgood|first=C.E. |author2=G.J. Suci |author3=P.H. Tannebaum|title=The Measurement of Meaning|year=1957|publisher=The Board of Trustees at the University of Illinois|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As defined in the ''Measurement of Meaning'' by Osgood, Suci and Tannebaum  the factors influencing the perception of space are these 3 things:
1.	Evaluation- including the aesthetic, affective and symbolic meaning of space
2.	Power- the energy requirements to adapt to a space
3.	Activity- links to the noise within a space and the worker’s relationship and satisfaction with job and task
In “Effects of the self-schema on perception of space at work” by Gustave Nicolas Fischer, Cyril Tarquinio, Jacqueline C. Vischer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=G.N.|author2=C.Tarquino, J.C. Vischer|title=Effects of the self-schema on perception of space at work|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|year=2004|volume=24|pages=131–140|doi=10.1016/s0272-4944(03)00052-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the study conducted linking design and psychology in the workplace. In this study they proposed a theoretical model linking environmental perception, work satisfaction and sense of self in a feedback loop. This is shown below in Fig. 1,  to illustrate their findings on the direct relationship the environment has with the inhabitant and how through psychology this affects behaviour.

== The System of Objects ==
Developed by [[Jean Baudrillard]] as part of his sociology doctorate thesis Le Système des objets ([[The System of Objects]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baudrillard|first=J.|title=The System of Objects (Verso English Edition)|year=1996|publisher=Bookmarque|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this he proposed the 4 object valuing criteria, these being:
# Function – a pen is used to write
# Exchange or economic value- a piano being worth three chairs
# Symbolic- an amethyst symbolising a birth in February
# Sign- the branding or prestige of an object, with no added function being valued over another, it may be used to suggest social values such as class.

In this way the objects and human relationship with objects in the interior environment has significant psychological meaning and impact. In “Social Attributions Based on Domestic Interiors” by M.A. Wilson and N.E. Mackenzie it is proposed that:
“people’s interactions with the environment are determined by the meanings they attribute to it, and both stress the impact of expectations on behaviour within a particular environment.”&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mackenzie|first=N.E.|author2=M.A. Wilson|title=Social Attributions Based on Domestic Interiors|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|year=2000|volume=20|pages=343–354|doi=10.1006/jevp.2000.0181}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The study they discuss further developed the theme, that objects and the way in which we classify them, in turn, allows us to classify the social attributes of the owner of the objects, in relation to age and social class according to the object valuing system. This system suggests that our relationship with objects affects both our behaviour as we use objects according to their function, but also how we are perceived in the eyes of other. This makes our relationship with objects and space pivotal to our psychology.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"/&gt;

== Space-Time Relationships ==
Charles Rice references the thinking of Walter Benjamin, in ''The Emergence of the Interior'',&lt;ref name="Rice"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rice|first=Charles|title=The Emergence of the Interior|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  on the study of interiorization and experience. He proposes that in our faster-paced modern society experiences are instantaneous and through this we are missing long experiences such as a connection with tradition and the accumulation of wisdom over time. To reforge a sense of this relationship and address the current lack he demonstrates that we might materially create such a relationship through inanimate objects in our environment. Giving the example: 
“that the hearth and the mantelpiece might materially encode the mythical fireside and the situation it provided for the telling of stories.”
In this way one’s relationship with objects can embody a sense of experience, and fulfil the desire for a connection with tradition.

== Brief Background ==

A greater awareness into this field has emerged since the 20th century, when the function and performance of the interior became of chief importance in designing habitations, the start of user-centred design, for example [[La Maison de Verre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edwards|first=M.J.|author2=W.G. Gjertson|title=La Maison de Verre: Negotiating a Modern Domesticity|journal=Journal of Interior Design|date=September 2008|volume=34|issue=1|pages=15–37|doi=10.1111/j.1939-1668.2008.00004.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This modern idea of the interior- designing for the user from the inside to the outside has coincided with psychological analysis on the and effects on inhabitations.

In ''The Emergence of the Interior'', Charles Rice rationalized the implications of the interior:&lt;ref name="Rice"/&gt;
•	Under context of modernity 
•	Status of the experience
•	Presence of history and
•	Knowledge about subjectivity

The Importance of the development of this field is evident through the above areas of study

Understanding and implementation of interior design psychology has the ability to impact and improve the performance, efficiency and wellbeing of the individual inhabitant. As illustrated through the above categories this is an important and relevant developing field within design and planning.

The '''Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary''' refers to a [[biblical commentary]] entitled a ''Commentary Critical and Explanatory on the Whole Bible'', prepared by Robert Jamieson, [[Andrew Robert Fausset]] and [[David Brown (Free Church of Scotland)|David Brown]] and published in 1871; and derived works from this initial publication, in differing numbers of volumes and abridgements. The commentary uses the [[King James Version of the Bible]] as its text.

==Background==
Robert Jamieson D.D. (1802–1880) was a minister at St. Paul’s Church, [[Provanmill]] in [[Glasgow]]. Andrew Fausset, A.M. (1821–1910) was rector of [[St Cuthbert's Church, York|St. Cuthbert’s Church]] in [[York (England)|York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/fausset_ar|title=A. R. Fausset - Christian Classics Ethereal Library|work=[[Christian Classics Ethereal Library]]|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Brown (1803–1897) was a [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] minister at St. James, Glasgow, and professor of [[theology]] at [[Christ's College, Aberdeen|Free Church College]] of the [[University of Aberdeen]].

The writers described their work as:

:[a] humble effort to make Scripture expound itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/jamieson-fausset-brown/revelation/revelation-22.html|title=Revelation 22 Commentary - Commentary Critical and Explanatory on the Whole Bible|website=Bible Study Tools|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

and prayed:

:May the Blessed Lord who has caused all holy Scriptures to be written for our learning, bless this ... effort ... and make it an instrument towards the conversion of sinners and the edification of saints, to the glory of His great name and the hastening of His kingdom! Amen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/jamieson-fausset-brown/revelation/revelation-22.html|title=Revelation 22 Commentary - Commentary Critical and Explanatory on the Whole Bible|website=Bible Study Tools|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example text==
On [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:1 -

1. In the beginning — a period of remote and unknown antiquity, hid in the depths of eternal ages; and so the phrase is used in {{bibleverse||Proverbs|8:22-23|KJV}}:

&lt;blockquote&gt;God — the name of the Supreme Being, signifying in Hebrew, "Strong," "Mighty." It is expressive of omnipotent power; and by its use here in the plural form, is obscurely taught at the opening of the Bible, a doctrine clearly revealed in other parts of it, namely, that though God is one, there is a plurality of persons in the Godhead — Father, Son, and Spirit, who were engaged in the creative work ([[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 8:27; [[Gospel of John|John]] 1:3, 10; [[Letter to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 3:9; [[Letter To the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 1:2; [[Book of Job|Job]] 26:13).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Life After People''''' is a television series on which [[scientists]], [[structural engineers]], and other experts speculate about what might become of Earth [[Human extinction|should humanity instantly disappear]]. The featured experts also talk about the impact of human absence on the environment and the vestiges of civilization thus left behind. The series was preceded by a two-hour special that aired on January 21, 2008 on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]&lt;ref name=special&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/minisites/life_after_people |title=Life After People — History.com TV Episodes, Schedule, &amp; Video |work=History.com |accessdate=August 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429170535/http://www.history.com/minisites/life_after_people/ |archivedate=April 29, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; which served as a de facto [[Television pilot|pilot]] for the series that premiered April 21, 2009. The documentary and subsequent series were both narrated by James Lurie.

==Format==
The program does not speculate on how humanity may disappear, stipulating only that it has, and that it has done so suddenly, leaving everything behind including household [[pets]] and [[livestock]] that have to fend for themselves. The [[thought experiment]] is based on documented results of the sudden removal of humans from a geographical area and the results that have occurred when people discontinue the maintenance of buildings and urban infrastructure. Lurie's narration begins:

{{cquote|What would happen if every human on Earth disappeared?  This ''isn't'' the story of how we might vanish...it's the story of what will happen to the world we leave behind}}

The series' episodes thematically offer examples of [[Urban decay|urban]] and [[Decomposition|biological decay]]. The focus is on specific locations such as [[skyscraper]]s, [[religious icons]], [[bridge]]s and [[dam]]s, and government buildings, and the fate of certain related objects, such as [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], [[document]]s and [[human body|human bodies]]. The fate of some kinds of [[plant|flora]] and [[animal|fauna]] are covered as well. Each episode also contains a segment in which experts examine real locations that have been abandoned by people, including [[ghost town]]s and other sites of deterioration, where the deterioration has been caused by events similar to those outlined in the episode. Although the series speculates on the fates of [[landmark]]s around the world, the main focus is on situations that may occur at locations in the United States.

The various events that may occur after people disappear suddenly are depicted using [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] dramatizations. The timeline of predicted events begins approximately one day after the disappearance of humankind and extends up to one hundred million years into the future (one day, one week, one year, 10 years, 15 years, 25 years, 50 years, 100 years, 200 years, etc.).

===Tagline===
The program's tagline is the ominous greeting:

{{cquote|Welcome to Earth...Population: Zero. [while all episodes end with the title fitting the last sentence,] ...in a life after people}}

[[Snack cake]]s survive 25 years, but jars of honey might remain edible for millennia. The episode also includes video from a [[Fort Worth, Texas]] grocery store which was abandoned for three months—with all the food still inside.

'''Massurrealism''' is a [[Portmanteau|portmanteau word]] coined in 1992 by American artist [[James Seehafer]],&lt;ref name="intute" /&gt; who described a trend among some [[postmodern art]]ists that mix the aesthetic styles and themes of [[surrealism]] and [[mass media]]&amp;mdash;including [[pop art]].&lt;ref name="intute"&gt;Adam. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110519201344/http://www.intute.ac.uk/cgi-bin/fullrecord.pl?handle=artifact1764 "massurrealism"], Intute:arts and humanities ([[University of Oxford]] and [[Manchester Metropolitan University]]), 17 October 2003. Retrieved 8 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Seehafer-Untitled-1990.jpg|thumb|right|75px|SFX photography, digital collage]]
Massurrealism is a development of surrealism that emphasizes the effect of technology and mass media on contemporary surrealist imagery.&lt;ref name="intute" /&gt; James Seehafer who is credited with coining the term in 1992&lt;ref name="intute" /&gt; said that he was prompted to do so because there was no extant definition to accurately characterize the type of work he was doing, which combined elements of [[surrealism]] and [[mass media]], the latter consisting of [[technology]] and [[pop art]]&amp;mdash;"a form of technology art."&lt;ref name=lecture&gt;Seehafer, James. [http://www.spbu.ru/Structure/Culture/Museums/History/koi/art_diss.htm#20_06eng "Discussions: The Artist and Modern Society."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608073616/http://www.spbu.ru/Structure/Culture/Museums/History/koi/art_diss.htm |date=2008-06-08 }}, lecture on Massurrealism at [[Saint Petersburg State University]], Saint Petersburg Russia, 20 June 2000. Retrieved 8 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He had begun his work by using a shopping cart, which "represented American mass-consumerism that fuels mass-media", and then incorporated collages of colour [[photocopy|photocopies]] and [[spray paint]]  with the artist's traditional medium of [[oil paint]].&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt;

In 1995, he assembled a small group show near [[New York City]] and found a local cyber-cafe, where he started to post material about massurrealism on internet arts news groups, inspiring some German art students to stage a massurrealist show.&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt; The next year he started his own web site, www.massurrealism.com and began to receive work from other artists, both mixed media and digitally-generated.&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt; He credits the World Wide Web with a major role in communicating massurrealism,&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt; which spread interest from artists in [[Los Angeles]], [[Mexico]]&lt;ref name=Itinerante&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwo3VDEahCg "Conoce más sobre el MASSURREALISMO? - Mexico City"] Retrieved 21 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and then [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=Ketter&gt;[http://www.kettererkunst.de/lexikon/massurrealismus.php "Massurrealismus (Massurrealism)"], Ketterer Kunst Auction House, Munich Germany. Retrieved 21 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Seehafer has said:
{{cquote|I am not being credited with inventing a new technique, nor I don't think I should be credited with starting a new art movement, but rather simply coining a word to categorize the type of modern day surrealist art that had been lacking in definition. As a result, word "massurrealism" has received a lot of enthusiasm from artists. Though there are some who feel that defining something essentially limits it, the human condition has always had the need to categorize and classify everything in life.&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt;}} 

The differentiating factor, according to Seehafer, between surrealism and massurrealism is the foundation of the former in the early 20th century in Europe before the spread of electronic mass media.&lt;ref name=lecture/&gt; It is difficult to define the visual style of massurrealism, though a general characteristic is the use of modern technology to fuse surrealism's traditional access to the unconscious with pop art's ironic contradictions.&lt;ref name=amazon&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dfine-art&amp;field-keywords=Massurrealism&amp;rh=i%3Afine-art%2Ck%3AMassurrealism/ "Other Art and related items"], Retrieved 21 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[graffiti]] artist [[Banksy]] illicitly hung a rock in the [[British Museum]] showing a caveman pushing a shopping cart, which Shelley Esaak of about.com described as "a nice tribute to James Seehafer and Massurrealism."&lt;ref&gt;Esaak, Shelley.

'''''Milieu intérieur''''' or interior [[:wikt:milieu|milieu]], from the [[French language|French]], ''milieu intérieur'' (the internal environment), is a phrase coined by [[Claude Bernard]] to refer to the [[Extracellular fluid|extra-cellular fluid environment]], more particularly the [[interstitial fluid]], and its [[physiology|physiological]] capacity to ensure protective stability for the [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] of [[multicellular organism]].

==Origin==

[[Claude Bernard]] used the phrase in several works from 1854 until his death in 1878. He most likely adopted it from the histologist [[Charles-Philippe Robin|Charles Robin]], who had employed the phrase "milieu de l’intérieur" as a synonym for the ancient [[Hippocrates|hippocratic]] idea of [[humors]]. Bernard was initially only concerned with the role of the blood but he later included that of the whole body in ensuring this internal stability.&lt;ref name="Gross"&gt;Gross, C. G. (1998) [http://www.princeton.edu/~cggross/Neuroscientist_98_Bernard.pdf "Claude Bernard and the constancy of the internal environment"] Neuroscientist 4: 380–385 [http://nro.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/4/5/380].&lt;/ref&gt; He summed up his idea as follows:

{{quote|The fixity of the milieu supposes a perfection of the organism such that the external variations are at each instant compensated for and equilibrated.... All of the vital mechanisms, however varied they may be, have always one goal, to maintain the uniformity of the conditions of life in the internal environment.... The stability of the internal environment is the condition for the free and independent life.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard, C. (1974) ''Lectures on the phenomena common to animals and plants.'' Trans Hoff HE, Guillemin R, Guillemin L, Springfield (IL): Charles C Thomas {{ISBN|978-0-398-02857-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bernard's work regarding the internal environment of regulation was supported by work in Germany at the same time. While Rudolf Virchow placed the focus on the cell, others, such as Carl von Rokitansky (1804–1878) continued to study humoral pathology particularly the matter of microcirculation. Von Rokitansky suggested that illness originated in damage to this vital microcirculation or internal system of communication. Hans Eppinger Jr. (1879–1946), a professor of internal medicine in Vienna, further
developed von Rokitansky's point of view and showed that every
cell requires a suitable environment which he called the [[ground substance]] for 
successful microcirculation. This work of German scientists was continued in the 20th century by Alfred Pischinger (1899–1982) who defined the connections between the ground substance or extracellular matrix and both the hormonal and autonomic nervous systems and saw therein a complex system of regulation for the body as a whole and for cellular functioning, which he termed the ground regulatory system (''das System der Grundregulation'').&lt;ref name=Pischinger&gt;{{cite book|last=Pischinger|first=Alfred|title=The Extracellular Matrix and Ground Regulation|year=2007|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley|isbn=1-55643-688-2|pages=Foreword by Hartmut Heine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early reception==

Bernard’s idea was initially ignored in the 19th century. This happened in spite of Bernard being highly honored as the founder of modern physiology (he indeed received the first [[france|French]] state funeral for a scientist). Even the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 edition of Encyclopædia Britannica]] does not mention it. His ideas about milieu intérieur only became central to the understanding of physiology in the early part of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Gross"/&gt; It was only with [[Joseph Barcroft]], [[Lawrence J. Henderson]], and particularly [[Walter Cannon]] and his idea of [[homeostasis]], that it received its present recognition and status.&lt;ref name="Cross"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cross | first1 = S. T. | last2 = Albury | first2 = W. R. | year = 1987 | title = Walter B. Cannon, L. J. Henderson, and the Organic Analogy | url = | journal = Osiris | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 165–192 [175] | doi = 10.1086/368665 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current 15th edition notes it as being Bernard's most important idea.

==Conceptual development==

Bernard created his concept to replace the ancient idea of [[Vitalism|life forces]] with that of a mechanistic process in which the body's physiology was regulated through multiple mechanical equilibrium adjustment feedbacks.&lt;ref name="Cross"/&gt; Walter Cannon's later notion of homeostasis (while also mechanistic) lacked this concern, and was even advocated in the context of such ancient notions as [[vis medicatrix naturae]].&lt;ref name="Cross"/&gt;

Cannon, in contrast to Bernard, saw the self-regulation of the body as a requirement for the evolutionary emergence and exercise of intelligence, and further placed the idea in a political context: "What corresponds in a nation to the internal environment of the body? The closest analogue appears to be the whole intricate system of production and distribution of merchandise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cannon | first1 = W. B | year = 1941 | title = The Body Physiologic and the Body Politic | journal = Science | volume = 93 | issue = | pages = 1–10 | jstor=1668231 | doi=10.1126/science.93.2401.1|bibcode = 1941Sci....93....1C }}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested, as an analogy to the body's own ability to ensure internal stability, that society should preserve itself with a technocratic bureaucracy, "biocracy".&lt;ref name="Cross"/&gt;

The idea of milieu intérieur, it has been noted, led [[Norbert Wiener]] to the notion of [[cybernetics]] and [[negative feedback]] creating self-regulation in the [[nervous system]] and in nonliving machines, and that "today, cybernetics, a formalization of Bernard’s constancy hypothesis, is viewed as one of the critical antecedents of contemporary cognitive science".&lt;ref name="Gross"/&gt;

=== Idea of internal communication ===

In addition to providing the basis for understanding the internal physiology in terms of the interdependence of the cellular and extracellular matrix or ground system, Bernard's fruitful concept of the milieu intérieur has also led to significant research regarding the system of communication that allows for the complex dynamics of homeostasis.

==== Work by Szent-Györgyi ====
Initial work was conducted by Albert Szent-Györgyi who concluded that organic communication could not be explained solely by the random collisions of molecules and studied energy fields as well as the connective tissue. He was aware of earlier work by Moglich and Schon (1938)&lt;ref name=Moglich&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moglich,|first=F.|author2=Schon, M.|title=Energy of vibration in crystals and molecular complexes|journal=Naturwissenschaften|year=1938|volume=26|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jordan (1938)&lt;ref name=Jordan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jordan|first=P.|title=The physical structure of organic giant molecules|journal=Naturwissenschaften|year=1938|volume=26|pages=693–694|bibcode = 1938NW.....26..693J |doi = 10.1007/BF01606595 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on non-electrolytic mechanisms of charge transfer in living systems. This was further explored and advanced by Szent-Györgyi in 1941 in a Koranyi Memorical Lecture in Budapest, published in both ''Science'' and ''Nature'', wherein he proposed that proteins are semi-conductors and capable of rapid transfer of free electrons within an organism. This idea was received with skepticism, but it is now generally accepted that most if not all parts of the extracellular matrix have semiconductor properties.&lt;ref name=Rosenberg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenberg|first=F.|author2=Postow, E.|title=Semiconduction in proteins and lipids – its possible biological import|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|year=1969|volume=158|pages=161–190|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1969.tb56221.x|bibcode = 1969NYASA.158..161R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gutman 1981"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gutman, F.,|first=Lyons, L.E.|title=Organic Semiconductors|year=1981|publisher=Krieger|location=Malabar, FL|pages=Part A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Koranyi Lecture triggered a growing molecular-electronics industry, using biomolecular semiconductors in nanoelectronic circuits.

In 1988 Szent-Györgyi stated that "Molecules do not have to touch each other to interact. Energy can flow through... the electromagnetic field" which "along with water, forms the matrix of life." This water is related also to the surfaces of proteins, DNA and all living molecules in the matrix. This is a structured water that provides stability for metabolic functioning, and related to collagen as well, the major protein in the extracellular matrix&lt;ref name=Cameron&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cameron|first=I.L.|title=Verification of simple hydration/dehydration methods to characterize multiple water compartments on Tendon Type 1 Collagen|journal=Cell Biology International|year=2007|volume=31|issue=6|pages=531–539|doi=10.1016/j.cellbi.2006.11.020|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in DNA.&lt;ref name=Corongiu&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corongiu|first=G.|author2=Clementi, E.|title=Simulations of the solvent structure for macromolecules.

Mitchell (1976) refers to these flow as 'proticity'.&lt;ref name=Mitchell&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=P.|title=Vectorial chemistry and the molecular mechanics of chemiosmotic coupling: power transmission by proticity|journal=Biochemical Society Transactions|year=1976|volume=4|pages=399–430|doi=10.1042/bst0040399 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Work in Germany ====

Work in Germany over the last half-century has also focused on the internal communication system, in particular as it relates to the ground system. This work has led to their characterization of the ground system or extracellular matrix interaction with the cellular system as a 'ground regulatory system', seeing therein the key to homeostasis, a body-wide communication and support system, vital to all functions.&lt;ref name=Pischinger /&gt;

In 1953 a German doctor and scientist, Reinhold Voll, discovered that points used in acupuncture had different electrical properties from the surrounding skin, namely a lower resistance. Voll further discovered that the measurement of the resistances at the points gave valuable indications as to the state of the internal organs. Further research was done by Dr. Alfred Pischinger, the originator of the concept of the 'system of ground regulation', as well as Drs. Helmut Schimmel, and Hartmut Heine, using Voll's method of electro-dermal screening. This further research revealed that the gene is not so much the controller but the repository of blueprints on how cells and higher systems should operate, and that the actual regulation of biological activities (see [[Epigenetic cellular biology]]) lies in a 'system of ground regulation'. This system is built on the ground substance, a complex connective tissue between all the cells, often also called the extra-cellular matrix. This ground substance is made up of 'amorphous' and 'structural' ground substance. The former is "a transparent, half-fluid gel produced and sustained by the fibroblast cells of the connective tissues" consisting of highly polymerized sugar-protein complexes.&lt;ref name=Frost&gt;{{cite book|last=Frost|first=Robert|title=Applied Kinesiology: A Training Manual and Reference Book of Basic Principles and Practices|year=2002|publisher=North Atlantic Books|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Applied_Kinesiology.html?id=Bl0BQvU6EfQC&amp;redir_esc=y}}{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground substance, according to German research, determines what enters and exits the cell and maintains homeostasis, which requires a rapid communication system to respond to complex signals(see also [[Bruce Lipton]]).

:This is made possible by the diversity of molecular structures of the sugar polymers of the ground substance, the ability to swiftly generate new such substances, and their high interconnectedness. This creates a redundance that makes possible the controlled oscillation of values above and below the dynamic homeostasis present in all living creatures. This is a kind of fast-responding, "short term memory" of the ground substance. Without this labile capacity, the system would quickly move to an energetic equilibrium, which would bring inactivity and death.&lt;ref name=Frost /&gt;

:For its biochemical survival, every organism requires the ability to rapidly construct, destroy and reconstruct the constituents of the ground substance.&lt;ref name=Frost /&gt;

Between the molecules that make up the ground substance there are minimal surfaces of potential energy. The charging and discharging of the materials of the ground substance cause 'biofield oscillations' (photon fields). The interference of these fields creates short lived (from 10–9 to up to 10–5 seconds) tunnels through the ground substance. 
:Through these tunnels, shaped like the hole through a donut, large chemicals may traverse from capillaries through the ground substance and into the functional cells of organs and back again. All metabolic processes depend upon this transport mechanism.&lt;ref name=Frost /&gt;

Major ordering energy structures in the body are created by the ground substance, such as collagen, which not only conducts energy but generates it, due to its piezoelectric properties.

:Like quartz crystal, collagen in the ground substance and the more stable connective tissues (fascia, tendons, bones, etc.). transforms mechanical energy (pressure, torsion, stretch) into electromagnetic energy, which then resonates through the ground substance (Athenstaedt, 1974). However, if the ground substance is chemically imbalanced, the energy resonating through the body loses coherence.&lt;ref name=Frost /&gt;

This is what occurs in the adaptation response described by [[Hans Selye]]. When the ground regulation is out of balance, the probability of chronic illness increases. Research by Heine indicates that unresolved emotional traumas release a neurotransmitter substance P which causes the collagen to take on a hexagonal structure that is more ordered than their usual structure, putting the ground substance out of balance, what he calls an "emotional scar"providing "an important scientific verification that diseases can have psychological causes."&lt;ref name=Frost /&gt; (see also [[Bruce Lipton]])

==== Work in the U.S. ====
While the initial work on identifying the importance of the ground regulatory system was done in Germany, more recent work examining the implications of inter and intra-cellular communication via the extra-cellular matrix has taken place in the U.S. and elsewhere.

Structural continuity between extracellular, cyst skeletal and nuclear components was discussed by Hay,&lt;ref name=Hay&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hay|first=E.D.|title=Extracellular Matrix|journal=Journal of Cell Biology|year=1981|volume=91|pages=205s–223s|doi=10.1083/jcb.91.3.205s|pmc=2112832}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berezny et al.&lt;ref name=Berenzey&gt;{{cite book|last=Berezney|first=R.|title=Nuclear Matrix and DNA Replication in Maul, GG (ed.) The Nuclear Envelope and the Nuclear Matrix|year=1982|publisher=Alan R. Liss|location=New York|pages=183–197|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Oschman.&lt;ref name="Oschman 1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oschman|first=J.L.|title=Structure and properties of ground substances|journal=American Zoologist|volume=24|pages=199–215|doi=10.1093/icb/24.1.199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, these elements have been referred to as ground substances, and because of their continuity, they act to form a complex, interlaced system that reaches into and contacts every part of the body. Even as early as 1851 it was recognized that the nerve and blood systems do not directly connect to the cell, but are mediated by and through an extracellular matrix.&lt;ref name="Oschman 2008b"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oschman|first=J.L.|title=Mitochondria and cellular aging|journal=Preparation for Anti-Aging Medical Therapeutics|year=2008|volume=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Recent research regarding the electrical charges of the various glycol-protein components of the extracellular matrix shows that because of the high density of negative charges on glycosaminoglycans (provided by sulfate and carboxylate groups of the uronic acid residues) the matrix is an extensive redox system capable of absorbing and donating electrons at any point.&lt;ref name=Levine&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=S.A.|author2=Kidd, M.P.|title=Antioxidant Adaptation: Its Role in Free Radical Pathology|journal=Biocurrent Division, San Leandro, CA|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; This electron transfer function reaches into the interiors of cells as the cytoplasmic matrix is also strongly negatively charged.&lt;ref name=Ling&gt;{{cite book|last=Ling|first=G.N.|title=A Physical Theory of the Living State: The Association-Induction Hypothesis|year=1962|publisher=Blaisdell|location=New York|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire extracellular and cellular matrix functions as a biophysical storage system or accumulator for electrical charge.
 
From thermodynamic, energetic and geometrical considerations, molecules of the ground substance are considered to form minimal physical and electrical surfaces, such that, based on the mathematics of minimal surfaces, minuscule changes can lead to significant changes in distant areas of the ground substance.&lt;ref name=Karcher&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karcher|first=H.|author2=Polthier, K.|title=Die geometrie von Minimalfachen|journal=Spektrum der Wissenschaft|year=1990|volume=10|pages=96–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery is seen as having implications for many physiological and biochemical processes, including membrane transport, antigen–antibody interactions, protein synthesis, oxidation reactions, actin–myosin interactions, sol to gel transformations in polysaccharides.&lt;ref name=Andersson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andersson|first=S.|title=Minimal surfaces and structures: from inorganic and metal crystals to cell membranes and biopolymers|journal=Chemical Reviews|year=1988|volume=88|pages=221–242|doi=10.1021/cr00083a011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pienta and Coffey (1991) published "Cellular harmonic information transfer through a tissue tensegrity-matrix system" combining the concepts of the living matrix, vibratory and resonant interactions, cellular and tissue continuity, piezoelectricity, solid-state biochemistry, coherence, and tensegrity – all creating a body-wide communication and regulatory system of living organisms.&lt;ref name=Pienta&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pienta|first=K.J.|author2=Coffey, D.S.|title=Cellular harmonic information transfer through a tissue tensegrity-matrix system|journal=Medical Hypotheses|year=1991|volume=34|pages=88–95|doi=10.1016/0306-9877(91)90072-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One description of the charge transfer process in the matrix is, "highly vectoral electron transport along biopolymer pathways".&lt;ref name=Lewis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=T.J.|title=Electronic processes in biology|journal=Physics in Medicine and Biology|year=1982|volume=27|issue=3|pages=335–352|doi=10.1088/0031-9155/27/3/001|bibcode = 1982PMB....27..335L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other mechanisms involve clouds of negative charge created around the proteoglycans in the matrix. There are also soluble and mobile charge transfer complexes in cells and tissues (e.g. Slifkin, 1971;&lt;ref name=Slifkin&gt;{{cite book|last=Slifkin|first=M.A.|title=Charge transfer Interactions of Biomolecules|year=1971|publisher=Academic Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gutman, 1978;&lt;ref name=Gutman&gt;{{cite book|last=Gutman|first=V.|title=The Donor-Acceptor Approach to Molecular Interactions|year=1978|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mattay, 1994&lt;ref name=Mattay&gt;{{cite book|last=Mattay|first=J. (Ed.)|title=Electron Transfer|year=1994|publisher=I. Springer|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Rudolph A. Marcus of the California Institute of Technology found that when the driving force increases beyond a certain level, electron transfer will begin to slow down instead of speed up (Marcus, 1992)&lt;ref name=Marcus&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marcus|first=R.A.|title=Electron transfer reactions in chemistry: theory and experiment|journal=Nobel Committee|date=8 December 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and he received a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1992 for this contribution to the theory of electron transfer reactions in chemical systems. The implication of the work is that a vectoral electron transport process may be greater the smaller the potential, as in living systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21523">In the [[power systems|power systems analysis]] field of [[electrical engineering]], a '''per-unit system'''  is the expression of system quantities as fractions of a defined base unit quantity. Calculations are simplified because quantities expressed as per-unit do not change when they are referred from one side of a transformer to the other. This can be a pronounced advantage in power system analysis where large numbers of transformers may be encountered. Moreover, similar types of apparatus will have the impedances lying within a narrow numerical range when expressed as a per-unit fraction of the equipment rating, even if the unit size varies widely. Conversion of per-unit quantities to volts, ohms, or amperes requires a knowledge of the base that the per-unit quantities were referenced to. The per-unit system is used in [[Power flow study|power flow]], [[short circuit]] evaluation, [[motor starting methods|motor starting]] studies etc.

The main idea of a per unit system is to absorb large differences in absolute values into base relationships. Thus, representations of elements in the system with per unit values become more uniform.

A per-unit system provides units for [[electric power|power]], [[voltage]], [[Current (electricity)|current]], [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], and [[admittance]]. With the exception of impedance and admittance, any two units are independent and can be selected as base values; power and voltage are typically chosen. All quantities are specified as multiples of selected base values.  For example, the base power might be the rated power of a [[transformer]], or perhaps an arbitrarily selected power which makes power quantities in the system more convenient.  The base voltage might be the nominal voltage of a [[Busbar|bus]].  Different types of quantities are labeled with the same symbol ('''pu'''); it should be clear whether the quantity is a voltage, current, or other unit of measurement.

==Purpose==

There are several reasons for using a per-unit system:
* Similar apparatus (generators, transformers, lines) will have similar per-unit impedances and losses expressed on their own rating, regardless of their absolute size. Because of this, per-unit data can be checked rapidly for gross errors. A per unit value out of normal range is worth looking into for potential errors.
* Manufacturers usually specify the impedance of apparatus in per unit values. 
* Use of the constant &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \sqrt{3} &lt;/math&gt; is reduced in three-phase calculations. 
* Per-unit quantities are the same on either side of a transformer, independent of voltage level
* By normalizing quantities to a common base, both hand and automatic calculations are simplified. 
* It improves numerical stability of automatic calculation methods.
* Per unit data representation yields important information about relative magnitudes.
The per-unit system was developed to make manual analysis of power systems easier.  Although power-system analysis is now done by computer, results are often expressed as per-unit values on a convenient system-wide base.

== Base quantities ==
Generally base values of power and voltage are chosen. The base power may be the rating of a single piece of apparatus such as a motor or generator. If a system is being studied, the base power is usually chosen as a convenient round number such as 10 MVA or 100 MVA. The base voltage is chosen as the nominal rated voltage of the system. All other base quantities are derived from these two base quantities. Once the base power and the base voltage are chosen, the base current and the base impedance are determined by the natural laws of electrical circuits. The base value should only be a magnitude, while the per-unit value is a phasor. The phase angles of complex power, voltage, current, impedance, etc., are not affected by the conversion to per unit values.

The purpose of using a per-unit system is to simplify conversion between different transformers. Hence, it is appropriate to illustrate the steps for finding per-unit values for voltage and impedance. First, let the base power (S_base) of each end of a transformer become the same. Once every S is set on the same base, the base voltage and base impedance for every transformer can easily be obtained. Then, the real numbers of impedances and voltages can be substituted into the per-unit calculation definition to get the answers for the per-unit system. If the per-unit values are known, the real values can be obtained by multiplying by the base values.

By convention, the following two rules are adopted for base quantities:

* The base power value is the same for the entire power system of concern.
* The ratio of the voltage bases on either side of a transformer is selected to be the same as the ratio of the transformer voltage ratings.

With these two rules, a per-unit impedance remains unchanged when referred from one side of a transformer to the other. This allows the ideal transformer to be eliminated from a transformer model.

==Relationship between units==

The relationship between units in a per-unit system depends on whether the system is [[single-phase]] or [[three-phase]].

===Single-phase===

Assuming that the independent base values are power and voltage, we have:

: &lt;math&gt;P_{\text{base}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{base}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, the base value for power may be given in terms of [[Reactive power|reactive]] or [[apparent power]], in which case we have, respectively,

: &lt;math&gt;Q_{\text{base}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;

or

: &lt;math&gt;S_{\text{base}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;

The rest of the units can be derived from power and voltage using the equations &lt;math&gt;S = IV&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P = S\cos(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q = S\sin(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt; \underline{V} = \underline{I} \underline{Z}&lt;/math&gt; ([[Ohm's law]]), &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; being represented by &lt;math&gt; \underline{Z} = R + j X = Z\cos(\phi) + j Z\sin(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;.  We have:

: &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{base}} = \frac{S_{\text{base}}}{V_{\text{base}}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{base}} = \frac{V_{\text{base}}}{I_{\text{base}}} = \frac{V_{\text{base}}^{2}}{I_{\text{base}}V_{\text{base}}} = \frac{V_{\text{base}}^{2}}{S_{\text{base}}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Y_{\mathrm{base}} = \frac{1}{Z_{\mathrm{base}}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;

===Three-phase===

Power and voltage are specified in the same way as single-phase systems.  However, due to differences in what these terms usually represent in three-phase systems, the relationships for the derived units are different. Specifically, power is given as total (not per-phase) power, and voltage is line-to-line voltage.
In three-phase systems the equations &lt;math&gt;P = S\cos(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q = S\sin(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; also hold. The apparent power &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; now equals &lt;math&gt;S_{\mathrm{base}}= \sqrt{3}V_{\mathrm{base}} I_{\mathrm{base}}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathrm{base}} = \frac{S_{\mathrm{base}}}{V_{\mathrm{base}} \times \sqrt{3}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z_{\mathrm{base}} = \frac{V_{\mathrm{base}}}{I_{\mathrm{base}} \times \sqrt{3}} = \frac{{V_{\mathrm{base}}^2}}{S_{\mathrm{base}}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Y_{\mathrm{base}} = \frac{1}{Z_{\mathrm{base}}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;

==Example of per-unit==

As an example of how per-unit is used, consider a three-phase power transmission system that deals with powers of the order of 500 MW and uses a nominal voltage of 138 kV for transmission.  We arbitrarily select &lt;math&gt;S_{\mathrm{base}} = 500\, \mathrm{MVA}&lt;/math&gt;, and use the nominal voltage 138 kV as the base voltage &lt;math&gt;V_{\mathrm{base}}&lt;/math&gt;.  We then have:

: &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{base}} = \frac{S_{\text{base}}}{V_{\text{base}} \times \sqrt{3}} = 2.09 \, \mathrm{kA}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{base}} = \frac{V_{\text{base}}}{I_{\text{base}} \times \sqrt{3}} = \frac{V_{\text{base}}^{2}}{S_{\text{base}}} = 38.1 \, \Omega&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Y_{\mathrm{base}} = \frac{1}{Z_{\mathrm{base}}} = 26.3 \, \mathrm{mS}&lt;/math&gt;

If, for example, the actual voltage at one of the buses is measured to be 136 kV, we have:

: &lt;math&gt;V_{\mathrm{pu}} = \frac{V}{V_{\mathrm{base}}} = \frac{136 \, \mathrm{kV}}{138 \, \mathrm{kV}} = 0.9855 \, \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;

== In transformers ==
It can be shown that voltages, currents, and impedances in a per-unit system will have the same values whether they are referred to primary or secondary of a [[transformer]].&lt;ref name="Sen 1997"&gt;{{cite book | last=Sen | first=P. C. | title=Principles of electric machines and power electronics | publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | location=New York | year=1997 | isbn=978-0-471-02295-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|85}}

For instance, for voltage, we can prove that the per unit voltages of two sides of the transformer, side 1 and side 2, are the same. Here, the per-unit voltages of the two sides are E&lt;sub&gt;1p.u.&lt;/sub&gt; and E&lt;sub&gt;2p.u.&lt;/sub&gt; respectively.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
E_{1,pu}&amp;=\frac{E_{1}}{V_{base1}}\\
&amp;= \frac {N_{1}E_{2}}{N_{2}V_{base1}} \\
&amp;= \frac {N_{1}E_{2}}{N_{2} \frac{N_{1}}{N_{2}} V_{base2}}\\
&amp;= \frac {E_{2}} {V_{base2}}\\
&amp;= E_{2,pu}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
 (source: Alexandra von Meier Power System Lectures, UC Berkeley)

‘E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the voltages of sides 1 and 2 in volts. N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of turns the coil on side 1 has. N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of turns the coil on side 2 has. V&lt;sub&gt;base1&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;base2&lt;/sub&gt; are the base voltages on sides 1 and 2. &lt;math&gt; V_{base1}=\frac{N_{1}}{N_{2}}V_{base2}&lt;/math&gt;

For current, we can prove that the per-unit currents of the two sides are the same below.
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
I_{1,pu}&amp;=\frac{I_{1}}{I_{base1}}\\
&amp;= \frac {N_{2}I_{2}}{N_{1}I_{base1}} \\
&amp;= \frac {N_{2}I_{2}}{N_{1} \frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}} I_{base2}}\\
&amp;= \frac {I_{2}} {I_{base2}}\\
&amp;= I_{2,pu}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
 (source: Alexandra von Meier Power System Lectures, UC Berkeley)

where I&lt;sub&gt;1p.u.&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;2p.u.&lt;/sub&gt; are the per-unit currents of sides 1 and 2 respectively. In this, the base currents I&lt;sub&gt;base1&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;base2&lt;/sub&gt; are related in the opposite way that V&lt;sub&gt;base1&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;base2&lt;/sub&gt; are related, in that

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
I_{base1} &amp;= \frac{S_{base1}} {V_{base1}}\\
S_{base1} &amp;= S_{base2}\\
V_{base2} &amp;= \frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}} V_{base1}\\
I_{base2} &amp;= \frac{S_{base2}} {V_{base2}}\\
I_{base1} &amp;= \frac{S_{base2}} { \frac{N_{1}}{N_{2}} V_{base2}}\\
&amp;= \frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}} I_{base2}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The reason for this relation is for power conservation
S&lt;sub&gt;base1&lt;/sub&gt; = S&lt;sub&gt;base2&lt;/sub&gt;

The full load [[copper loss]] of a transformer in per-unit form is equal to the per-unit value of its resistance:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P_{cu,FL}&amp;=\text{full-load copper loss}\\
&amp;= I_{R1}^2R_{eq1}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P_{cu,FL,pu}&amp;=\frac{P_{cu,FL}}{P_{base}}\\
&amp;= \frac {I_{R1}^2R_{eq1}} {V_{R1}I_{R1}}\\
&amp;= \frac {R_{eq1}} {V_{R1}/I_{R1}}\\
&amp;= \frac {R_{eq1}} {Z_{B1}}\\
&amp;= R_{eq1,pu}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, it may be more useful to express the resistance in per-unit form as it also represents the full-load copper loss.&lt;ref name="Sen 1997" /&gt;{{rp|86}}

As stated above, there are two degrees of freedom within the per unit system that allow the engineer to specify any per unit system. The degrees of freedom are the choice of the base voltage (V{{sub|base}}) and the base power (S{{sub|base}}). By convention, a single base power (S{{sub|base}}) is chosen for both sides of the transformer and its value is equal to the rated power of the transformer. By convention, there are actually two different base voltages that are chosen, V{{sub|base1}} and V{{sub|base2}} which are equal to the rated voltages for either side of the transformer. By choosing the base quantities in this manner, the transformer can be effectively removed from the circuit as described above. For example:

Take a transformer that is rated at 10 kVA and 240/100 V. The secondary side has an impedance equal to 1∠0° ohms. The base impedance on the secondary side is equal to:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Z_{base,2}&amp;=\frac{V_{base,2}^2}{S_{base}}\\
&amp;= \frac {10000} {10000}\\
&amp;= \text {1 ohm}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the per unit impedance on the secondary side is 1∠0° ohm / 1 ohm = 1∠0° p.u. When this impedance is referred to the other side, the impedance becomes:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Z_{2}&amp;=\left(\frac{240}{100}\right)^2\times\text{1∠0° ohm}\\
&amp;= \text {5.76∠0° ohm}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The base impedance for the primary side is calculated the same way as the secondary:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Z_{base,1}&amp;=\frac{V_{base,1}^2}{S_{base}}\\
&amp;= \frac {57600} {10000}\\
&amp;= \text {5.76 ohm}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the per unit impedance is 5.76∠0° ohm / 5.76 ohm = 1∠0° p.u. which is the same as when calculated from the other side of the transformer, as would be expected.

Another useful tool for analyzing transformers is to have the base change formula that allows the engineer to go from a base impedance with one set of a base voltage and base power to another base impedance for a different set of a base voltage and base power. This becomes especially useful in real life applications where a transformer with a secondary side voltage of 1.2 kV might be connected to the primary side of another transformer whose rated voltage is 1 kV. The formula is as shown below.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Z_{base,new}&amp;=Z_{base,old}\times\left(\frac{V_{base,old}}{V_{base,new}}\right)^2\times\left(\frac{S_{base,new}}{S_{base,old}}\right)\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Phytotelma''' (plural '''phytotelmata''') is a small water-filled cavity in a terrestrial plant. The water accumulated within these plants may serve as the habitat for associated [[fauna]] and [[flora]]. Often the faunae associated with phytotelmata are unique. Some species also are of great practical significance; for example, immature stages of some [[mosquito]]es, such as some ''[[Anopheles]]'' and ''[[Aedes]]'' species that are important disease vectors, develop in phytotelmata.&lt;ref name="Frank and Lounibos 1983"&gt;Frank, J.H. and Lounibos, L.P.

A multi-authored book edited by Frank and Lounibos (1983)&lt;ref name="Frank and Lounibos 1983" /&gt; dealt in 11 chapters with classification of phytotelmata, and with phytotelmata provided by bamboo internodes, banana leaf axils, [[bromeliad]] [[leaf axil]]s, ''[[Nepenthes]]'' pitchers, ''[[Sarracenia]]'' pitchers, [[Tree hollow|tree holes]], and ''[[Heliconia]]'' flower [[bract]]s.

A classification of phytotelmata by Kitching (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Kitching, R.L. (2000). ''Food webs and container habitats: The natural history and ecology of phytotelmata''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-77316-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognizes five principal types: bromeliad tanks, certain [[carnivorous plant]]s such as [[pitcher plant]]s, water-filled [[tree hollow]]s, [[bamboo]] internodes, and axil water (collected at the base of leaves, petals or [[bract]]s); it concentrated on food webs. A review by Greeney (2001)&lt;ref&gt;Greeney, H.F. (2001). The insects of plant-held waters: a brief review and bibliography. ''Journal of Tropical Ecology'' '''17'''(2): 241–260. {{DOI|10.1017/S026646740100116X}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified seven forms: tree holes, leaf [[axil]]s, flowers, modified leaves, fallen vegetative parts (e.g. leaves or bracts), fallen fruit [[husk]]s, and [[stem rot]]s.

==Etymology==
The word "phytotelma" derives from the [[ancient Greek]] roots ''phyto-'', meaning 'plant', and ''[[wikt:τέλμα|telma]]'', meaning 'pond'. Thus, the correct [[Grammatical number|singular]] is ''phytotelma''.

The term was coined by L. Varga in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Varga, L. (1928). Ein interessanter Biotop der Biocönose von Wasserorganism. ''Biologische Zentralblatt'' '''48''': 143–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

The correct pronunciation is "phytotēlma" and "phytotēlmata" because of the Greek origin (the stressed vowels are here written as ''ē'').

'''Pseudocopulation''' describes behaviors similar to [[Copulation (zoology)|copulation]] that serve a reproductive function for one or both participants but do not involve actual sexual union between the individuals. It is most generally applied to a [[pollinator]] attempting to copulate with a [[flower]]. Some flowers [[mimicry|mimic]] a potential female mate visually, but the key stimuli are often chemical and tactile.&lt;ref name=Orchid&gt;{{Cite book |ref=harv |first1=Leendert |last1=van der Pijl |first2=Calaway H. |last2=Dodson |title=Orchid Flowers: Their Pollination and Evolution |chapter=Chapter 11: Mimicry and Deception |publisher=[[University of Miami]] Press |location=Coral Gables |year=1966 |pages=129–141 |isbn=0-87024-069-2 |oclc=310489511 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of [[mimicry in plants]] is called '''Pouyannian mimicry'''.&lt;ref name=Pasteur&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125 |title=A Classificatory Review of Mimicry Systems |year=1982 |last1=Pasteur |first1=G |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |volume=13 |pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orchid]]s commonly achieve reproduction in this manner, secreting chemicals from glands (osmophores) in the [[sepal]]s, [[petal]]s, or [[Labellum (botany)|labellum]], that are indistinguishable from the insect's natural [[pheromone]]s. The pollinator then has a [[pollinium]] attached to its body, which it transfers to the stigma of another flower when it attempts another 'copulation'. Pollinators are often [[bee]]s,  and [[wasp]]s of the order [[Hymenoptera]], and [[fly|flies]].

The cost to the pollinating insects might be seen as negligible, but study of ''[[Cryptostylis]]'' (an Australian orchid) pollinators shows that they may waste large amounts of [[sperm]] by ejaculating onto the flower. Thus there could be antagonistic [[coevolution]] such that pollinators become better at identifying their own species correctly and orchids become better mimics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1086/587532 |title=Orchid Sexual Deceit Provokes Ejaculation |year=2008 |last1=Gaskett |first1=A.

Pseudocopulation is also used to describe close physical contact between mating animals which have their eggs [[external fertilization|externally fertilized]]. [[Frog]]s provide one such case, with the male releasing sperm as the female discharges her eggs, a process called [[amplexus]].&lt;ref&gt;pseudocopulation. (2007). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved October 19, 2007, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9061690&lt;/ref&gt; In some species of [[starfish]], a male and female may come together and form a pair. The male climbs on top, placing his arms between those of the female. When she releases eggs into the water, he is induced to release his sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/BF00391987| issn = 0025-3162| volume = 99| issue = 2| pages = 247–253|author1=Run, J. -Q. |author2=Chen, C. -P. |author3=Chang, K. -H. |author4=Chia, F. -S. | title = Mating behaviour and reproductive cycle of ''Archaster typicus'' (Echinodermata: Asteroidea)| journal = Marine Biology|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pseudocopulation is also used as a term to describe behaviours of birds that appear to be copulating but may merely involve mounting and could involve pairs of the same sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Edward M. |last=Barrows |title=Animal-behavior desk reference: a dictionary of animal behavior, ecology, and evolution |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton |year=2001 |page=148 |isbn=0-8493-2005-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Schering Bridge''' is an [[electrical circuit]] used for measuring the insulating properties of electrical cables and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://myclassbook.wordpress.com/2013/08/02/schering-bridge-measurement-of-capacitance/ ''Schering Bridge (Measurement of Capacitance)''], Myclassbook, 2 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an [[Alternating current|AC]] [[bridge circuit]], developed by [[Harald Schering]]. It has the advantage that the balance equation is independent of frequency. 

The connections of the Schering bridge under balance conditions are shown in the figure below.

* C4 = a variable capacitor,
* R4 = a non-inductive resistance [[in parallel]] with the variable capacitor C4.

== Secret law in the United States ==

Since about 2015 the branches of the United States federal government have accused one another of creating secret law.  Journalists, scholars, and anti-secrecy activists have also made similar allegations.  Scholarly analysis has shown that secret law is present in all three branches.  One scholar, Professor Dakota Rudesill, recommends that the country affirmatively decide whether to tolerate secret law, and proposes principles for governing it, including: public law’s supremacy over secret law; no secret criminal law; public notification of creation of secret law; presumptive sunset and publication dates; and availability of all secret law to Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rudesill|first1=Dakota|title=Coming to Terms With Secret Law|journal=Harvard National Security Journal|date=2015|volume=7|issue=1|pages=241–391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =The new era secret law | work = | date =18 October 2016 | url = https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/new-era-secret-law| accessdate = 15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secret regulations in UK public places==
In Britain many open places freely accessible by the public are actually [[privately owned public space]]s (POPS). Information on ownership is considered confidential, and not provided either by the owners, or by [[Local government in England|local councils]] that have the information. As in any private property the owner may require visitors to abide by specified rules; but people freely accessing the place are not informed of the rules, which may nevertheless be enforced by security guards. Typical prohibitions which do not apply to genuinely public spaces include protesting, and photography.

Councils mostly refused to provide information on existing and planned pseudo-public spaces. They also refused to say how information could be obtained, or to provide information on private restrictions on exercising the other rights people have on genuinely public land. Councils were criticised for being under the influence of property developers and corporate owners. A member of the London Assembly said "Being able to know what rules you are being governed by, and how to challenge them, is a fundamental part of democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/sep/26/its-really-shocking-uk-cities-refusing-to-reveal-extent-of-pseudo-public-space#comment-105829422 |title='It's really shocking': UK cities refusing to reveal extent of pseudo-public space |newspaper=The Guardian |date=26 September 2017  |author= |accessdate= 26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="62692">A '''story within a story''' is a [[literary device]] in which one character within a [[narrative]] narrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=David |last=Herman|first2=Manfred |last2=Jahn|first3=Marie-Laure |last3=Ryan|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oX8hmVw_yXYC&amp;pg=PA134|accessdate=30 July 2013|date=13 May 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-45840-0|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mise en abyme]]'' is the [[French language|French]] term for a similar literary device (also referring to the practice in [[heraldry]] of placing the image of a small shield on a larger shield). A story within a story can be used in all types of narration: [[novel]]s, [[short stories]], [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[television program]]s, [[film]]s, [[poem]]s, [[song]]s, and [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[essays]].  The inner stories are told either simply to entertain or more usually to act as an example to the other characters. In either case the story often has symbolic and psychological significance for the characters in the outer story. There is often some parallel between the two stories, and the fiction of the inner story is used to reveal the truth in the outer story.  Often the stories within a story are used to satirize views, not only in the outer story, but also in the real world.  When a story is told within another instead of being told as part of the plot, it allows the author to play on the reader's perceptions of the characters—the motives and the [[unreliable narrator|reliability of the storyteller]] are automatically in question. Stories within a story may disclose the background of characters or events, tell of myths and legends that influence the plot, or even seem to be extraneous diversions from the plot. In some cases, the story within a story is involved in the action of the plot of the outer story.  In others, the inner story is independent, so that it can either be skipped over or be read separately, although many subtle connections may be lost. Sometimes, the inner story serves as an outlet for discarded [[idea]]s that the author deemed to be of too much merit to leave out completely, something that is somewhat analogous to the inclusion of [[deleted scenes]] with [[DVD]] releases of films.  Often, there is more than one level of internal stories, leading to deeply-nested fiction.

==Frame stories and Anthology Works==
{{main|Frame story}}
The literary device of stories within a story dates back to a device known as a "[[frame story]]", where a supplemental story is used to help tell the main story. Typically, the outer story, or "frame" does not have much matter, and most of the bulk of the work consists of one or more complete stories told by one or more storytellers.

The earliest examples of "frame stories" and "stories within stories" were in ancient Egyptian and [[Indian literature]], such as the Egyptian [[Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=312|editor=[[John Clute]] and [[John Grant (author)|John Grant]]|title=[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]|year=1999|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780312198695}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Indian epics]] like the ''[[Ramayana]]'', ''[[Seven Wise Masters]]'', ''[[Hitopadesha]]'' and ''[[Baital Pachisi|Vikram and the Vampire]]''. In [[Vishnu Sarma]]'s ''[[Panchatantra]]'', an inter-woven series of colorful animal tales are told with one narrative opening within another, sometimes three or four layers deep, and then unexpectedly snapping shut in irregular rhythms to sustain attention. In the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the [[Kurukshetra War]] is narrated by a character in [[Vyasa]]'s ''Jaya'', which itself is narrated by a character in [[Vaisampayana]]'s ''Bharata'', which itself is narrated by a character in Ugrasrava's ''Mahabharata''.

Both ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' by [[Apuleius]] and ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' by [[Ovid]] extend the depths of framing to several degrees. Another early example is the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''), where the general story is narrated by an unknown narrator, and in this narration the stories are told by [[Scheherazade]]. In many of Scheherazade's narrations there are also [[List of stories within One Thousand and One Nights|stories narrated]], and even in some of these, there are some other stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Burton | first =Richard | authorlink =Richard Francis Burton | title =The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night, Volume 1 |publisher =[[Project Gutenberg]] |date=September 2003 |location = |pages = |url = http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext02/11001108.txt | doi = | id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is "[[The Three Apples]]", a [[murder mystery]] narrated by Scheherazade. Within the story, after the murderer reveals himself, he narrates a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] of events leading up to the murder. Within this flashback, an [[unreliable narrator]] tells a story to mislead the would-be murderer, who later discovers that he was misled after another character narrates the truth to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992 |isbn=90-04-09530-6|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the story concludes, the "[[s:Tale of Núr al-Dín Alí and his Son|Tale of Núr al-Dín Alí and his Son]]" is narrated within it.  This perennially popular work can be traced back to [[Arabic literature|Arabic]], [[Persian literature|Persian]], and Indian storytelling traditions. 

[[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' has a deeply nested frame story structure, that features the narration of an Arctic explorer, who records the narration of Victor Frankenstein, who recounts the narration of his creation, who narrates the story of a cabin dwelling family he secretly observes.  Similarly, [[Roald Dahl]]'s story ''[[The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar]]'' is about a rich bachelor who finds an essay written by someone who learnt to "see" playing cards from the reverse side. The full text of this essay is included in the story, and itself includes a lengthy sub-story told as a true experience by one of the essay's protagonists, Imhrat Khan.

[[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' and [[Boccacio]]'s [[Decameron]] are also classic frame stories.  In [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', the characters tell tales suited to their personalities and tell them in ways that highlight their personalities. The noble knight tells a noble story, the boring character tells a very dull tale, and the rude miller tells a smutty tale. [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' too makes use of this device; [[Odysseus]]' adventures at sea are all narrated by Odysseus to the court of king [[Alcinous]] in [[Scheria]]. Other shorter tales, many of them false, account for much of the ''Odyssey''.  Many modern children's story collections are essentially [[anthology]] works connected by this device, such as [[Arnold Lobel]]'s ''Mouse Tales'', [[Paula Fox]]'s ''The Little Swineherd'', and Phillip and Hillary Sherlock's ''Ears and Tails and Common Sense''.

A well-known modern example of framing is ''[[The Princess Bride]]'' (both the book and the movie). In the movie, a grandfather is reading the story of "The Princess Bride" to his grandson. In the book, a more detailed frame story has a father editing a much longer (but fictive) work for his son, creating his own "Good Parts Version" (as the book called it) by leaving out all the parts that would bore a young boy. Both the book and the movie assert that the central story is from a book called "The Princess Bride" by a nonexistent author named [[William_Goldman#Autobiographical_fiction|S. Morgenstern]].
 
In the Welsh novel, [[Aelwyd F'Ewythr Robert]] (1852) by [[Gwilym Hiraethog]] a visitor to a farm in north Wales tells the story of [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]] to those gathered around the hearth.

Sometimes a frame story exists in the same setting as the main story. On the television series ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', each episode was framed as though it were being told by [[Indiana Jones|Indy]] when he was older (usually acted by [[George Hall (actor)|George Hall]], but once by [[Harrison Ford]]).  The same device of an adult narrator representing the older version of a young protagonist is used in the films ''[[Stand By Me (film)|Stand By Me]]'' and ''[[A Christmas Story]]'', and the television show ''[[The Wonder Years]]''.

====Frame Stories in Music====

In [[The Amory Wars]], a tale told through the music of [[Coheed and Cambria]], tells a story for the first two albums but reveals that the story is being actively written by a character called the Writer in the third. During the album, the Writer delves into his own story and kills one of the characters, much to the dismay of the main character.

The critically acclaimed [[Beatles]] album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' is presented as a stage show by the fictional eponymous band, and one of its songs, "A Day in the Life" is in the form of a story within a dream. Similarly, the [[Fugees]] album ''[[The Score (Fugees album)|The Score]]'' is presented as the soundtrack to a fictional movie, as are several other notable [[concept albums]], while [[Wyclef Jean]]'s ''[[Wyclef_Jean_Presents_The_Carnival|The Carnival]]'' is presented as testimony at a trial.  The majority of [[Ayreon]]'s albums outline a sprawling, loosely interconnected science fiction narrative, as do the albums of [[Janelle Monae]].

==Examples of nested stories by type==
===Nested Books===

In his 1895 [[historical novel]] ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', [[Bolesław Prus]] introduces a number of stories within the story, ranging in length from [[vignette (literature)|vignettes]] to full-blown stories, many of them drawn from [[ancient Egypt]]ian texts, that further the plot, illuminate [[Character (arts)|characters]], and even inspire the fashioning of individual characters.  [[Jan Potocki]]'s ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa]]'' (1797–1805) has an interlocking structure with stories-within-stories reaching several levels of depth.

The [[provenance]] of the story is sometimes explained internally, as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], which depicts the [[Red Book of Westmarch]] (a story-internal version of the book itself) as a history compiled by several of the characters. The [[subtitle (titling)|subtitle]] of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' ("There and Back Again") is depicted as part of a rejected title of this book within a book, and ''The Lord of the Rings'' is a part of the final title.&lt;ref name = "havens"&gt;{{ME-ref|rotk|"The Grey Havens"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an interconnected inner story is "The Mad Trist" in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher|Fall of the House of Usher]]'', where through somewhat mystical means the narrator's reading of the story within a story influences the reality of the story he has been telling, so that what happens in "The Mad Trist" begins happening in "The Fall of the House of Usher". Also, in ''[[Don Quixote]]'' by [[Cervantes]], there are many stories within the story that influence the hero's actions (there are others that even the author himself admits are purely digressive).

A commonly independently [[anthology|anthologised]] story is "[[The Grand Inquisitor]]" by [[Dostoevsky]] from his long [[psychological novel]] ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', which is told by one brother to another to explain, in part, his view on religion and morality. It also, in a succinct way, dramatizes many of Dostoevsky's interior conflicts.

An example of a "bonus material" style inner story is the chapter "The Town Ho's Story" in [[Herman Melville]]'s novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]''; that chapter tells a fully formed story of an exciting [[mutiny]] and contains many plot ideas that Melville had conceived during the early stages of writing ''Moby-Dick''—ideas originally intended to be used later in the novel—but as the writing progressed, these plot ideas eventually proved impossible to fit around the characters that Melville went on to [[Characterization|create and develop]]. Instead of discarding the ideas altogether, Melville wove them into a coherent short story and had the character Ishmael demonstrate his eloquence and intelligence by [[story telling|telling the story]] to his impressed friends. 

With the rise of [[Modernist literature|literary modernism]], writers experimented with ways in which multiple narratives might nest imperfectly within each other. A particularly ingenious example of nested narratives is [[James Merrill]]'s 1974 [[Modernist poetry in English|modernist poem]] "[[Lost in Translation (poem)|Lost in Translation]]".

In [[Rabih Alameddine]]'s novel ''The Hakawati'', or ''The Storyteller'', the protagonist describes coming home to the funeral of his father, one of a long line of traditional Arabic storytellers. Throughout the narrative, the author becomes hakawati (an Arabic word for a teller of traditional tales) himself, weaving the tale of the story of his own life and that of his family with folkloric versions of tales from Qur'an, the Old Testament, Ovid, and One Thousand and One Nights. Both the tales he tells of his family (going back to his grandfather) and the embedded folk tales, themselves embed other tales, often 2 or more layers deep.

In [[Sue Townsend]]'s ''[[Adrian Mole: The Wilderness Years]]'', [[Adrian Mole|Adrian]] writes a book entitled ''Lo! The Flat Hills Of My Homeland'', in which the main character, Jake Westmorland, writes a book called ''Sparg of Kronk'', whose eponymous character, Sparg, writes a book with no language.

Dreams are a common way of including stories inside stories, and can sometimes go several levels deep.  Both the book ''The Arabian Nightmare'' and the curse of "eternal waking" from the [[Neil Gaiman]] series ''The Sandman'' feature an endless series of waking from one dream into another dream.  In [[Charles Maturin]]'s novel ''[[Melmoth the Wanderer]]'', the use of vast stories-within-stories creates a sense of dream-like quality in the reader.

=====Religion and Philosophy=====

This structure is also found in classic religious and philosophical texts.  The structure of ''[[The Symposium]]'' and ''[[Phaedo]]'', attributed to [[Plato]], is of a story within a story within a story.  In the Christian [[Bible]], the [[gospels]] are retellings of stories from the life and ministry of [[Jesus]].  However, they also include within them the stories ([[parable|parables]]) that Jesus told.  In more modern philosophical work, [[Jostein Gaarder]]'s books often feature this device. Examples are ''The Solitaire Mystery'', where the protagonist receives a small book from a baker, in which the baker tells the story of a sailor who tells the story of another sailor, and ''[[Sophie's World]]'' about a girl who is actually a character in a book that is being read by Hilde, a girl in another dimension. Later on in the book Sophie questions this idea, and realizes that Hilde too could be a character in a story that in turn is being read by another.

=====Nested science fiction=====
The experimental modernist works that incorporate multiple narratives into one story are quite often science-fiction or science fiction influenced.  These include most of the various novels written by the American author [[Kurt Vonnegut]]. Vonnegut includes the recurring character [[Kilgore Trout]] in many of his novels. Trout acts as the mysterious [[science fiction]] writer who enhances the morals of the novels through plot descriptions of his stories. Books such as ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'' and ''[[God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater]]'' are sprinkled with these plot descriptions.  [[Stanisław Lem]]'s ''Tale of the Three Storytelling Machines of King Genius'' from ''[[The Cyberiad]]'' has several levels of storytelling. All levels tell stories of the same person, Trurl.  

''[[House of Leaves]]'' is the tale of a man who finds a manuscript telling the story of a documentary that may or may not have ever existed, contains multiple layers of plot. The book includes footnotes and letters that tell their own stories only vaguely related to the events in the main narrative of the book, and footnotes for fake books. 

[[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s later books (''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'', ''[[The Cat Who Walks Through Walls]]'' and ''[[To Sail Beyond the Sunset]]'') propose the idea that every real universe is a fiction in another universe. This [[World as Myth|hypothesis]] enables many writers who are characters in the books to interact with their own creations.  [[Margaret Atwood]]'s novel ''[[The Blind Assassin]]'' is interspersed with excerpts from a novel written by one of the main characters; the novel-within-a-novel itself contains a [[science fiction]] story written by one of ''that'' novel's characters. 

In [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'', each character comes into interaction with a book called ''The Grasshopper Lies Heavy'', which was written by the Man in the High Castle. As Dick's novel details a world in which the [[Axis Powers of World War II]] had [[Axis victory in World War II|succeeded in dominating the known world]], the novel within the novel details an alternative to this history in which the Allies overcome the Axis and bring stability to the world – a victory which itself is quite different from our history.  

In ''[[Red Orc's Rage]]'' by [[Philip J. Farmer]] a doubly [[recursive method]] is used to interwine its fictional layers. This novel is part of a science-fiction series, the ''[[World of Tiers]]''. Farmer collaborated in the writing of this novel with an American psychiatrist, Dr. A. James Giannini. Dr. Giannini had previously used the World of Tiers series in treating patients in group therapy. During these therapeutic sessions, the content and process of the text and novelist was discussed rather than the lives of the patients. In this way subconscious defenses could be circumvented. Farmer took the real life case-studies and melded these with adventures of his characters in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. J. |last=Giannini |title=Use of fiction in therapy |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=18 |issue=7 |pages=56–57 |year=2001 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/articles/use-fiction-therapy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Quantum Leap (TV series)|Quantum Leap]]'' novel ''[[Knights Of The Morningstar]]'' also features a character who writes a book by that name.  In [[Matthew Stover]]'s novel ''[[Shatterpoint]]'', the protagonist [[Mace Windu]] narrates the story within his journal, while the main story is being told from the [[third-person limited]] point of view.  

Several ''[[Star Trek]]'' tales are stories or events within stories, such as [[Gene Roddenberry]]'s [[novelization]] of ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', [[J. A. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Mudd's Angels]]'', [[John M. Ford]]'s ''[[The Final Reflection]]'', [[Margaret Wander Bonanno]]'s ''[[Strangers from the Sky]]'' (which adopts the conceit that it is book from the future by an author called Gen Jaramet-Sauner), and J. R. Rasmussen's "Research" in the anthology ''[[Star Trek: Strange New Worlds]] II''. [[Steven Barnes]]'s novelization of "[[Far Beyond the Stars]]" partners with [[Greg Cox (writer)|Greg Cox]]'s ''[[The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh]]'' (Volume Two) to tell us that the story "Far Beyond the Stars"—and, by extension, all of ''Star Trek'' itself—is the creation of 1950s writer Benny Russell.

The book ''[[Cloud Atlas (novel)|Cloud Atlas]]'' (later adapted into a film by [[The Wachowskis|The Wachowkis]] and [[Tom Tykwer]]) consisted of six interlinked stories nested inside each other in a Russian doll fashion. The first story (that of Adam Ewing in the 1850s befriending an escaped slave) is interrupted halfway through and revealed to be part of a journal being read by composer Robert Frobisher in 1930s Belgium. His own story of working for a more famous composer is told in a series of letters to his lover Rufus Sixsmith, which are interrupted halfway through and revealed to be in the possession of an investigative journalist named Luisa Rey and so on. Each of the first five tales are interrupt in the middle, with the sixth tale being told in full, before the preceding five tales are finished in reverse order. Each layer of the story either challenges the veracity of the previous layer, or is challenged by the succeeding layer. Presuming each layer to be a true telling within the overall story, a chain of events is created linking Adam Ewing's embrace of the abolitionist movement in the 1850s to the religious redemption of a post apocalyptic tribal man over a century after the fall of modern civilization. The characters in each nested layer take inspiration or lessons from the stories of their predecessors in a manner that validates a belief stated in the sixth tale that "Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others, past and present and by each crime, and every kindness, we birth our future."

====Play or film within a book====
''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]'' by [[Thomas Pynchon]] has several characters seeing a play called ''The Courier's Tragedy'' by the fictitious [[English Renaissance theatre|Jacobean]] [[playwright]] Richard Wharfinger. The events of the play broadly mirror those of the novel and give the main character, Oedipa Maas, a greater context with which to consider her predicament; the play concerns a feud between two rival mail distribution companies, which appears to be ongoing to the present day, and in which, if this is the case, Oedipa has found herself involved. As in ''[[Hamlet]]'', the director makes changes to the original script; in this instance, a couplet that was added, possibly by religious zealots intent on giving the play extra moral gravity, are said only on the night that Oedipa sees the play. From what Pynchon tells us, this is the only mention in the play of Thurn and Taxis' rivals' name—Trystero—and it is the seed for the conspiracy that unfurls.  A significant portion of [[Walter Moers]]' ''Labyrinth of Dreaming Books'' is an [[ekphrasis]] on the subject of an epic puppet theater presentation.  Another example is found in [[Samuel Delany]]'s ''[[Trouble on Triton]]'', which features a theater company that produces elaborate staged spectacles for randomly selected single-person audiences.  Plays produced by the "Caws of Art" theater company also feature in Russell Hoban's modern fable, [[The Mouse and His Child]].

In [[Manuel Puig]]'s ''[[Kiss of the Spider Woman (novel)| Kiss of the Spider Woman]]'', ekphrases on various old movies, some real, and some fictional, make up a substantial portion of the narrative.  In [[Paul Russell (novelist)|Paul Russell]]'s ''Boys of Life'', descriptions of movies by director/antihero Carlos (loosely inspired by controversial director [[Pier Paulo Pasolini]]) provide a narrative counterpoint and add a touch of surrealism to the main narrative.  They additionally raise the question of whether works of artistic genius justify or atone for the sins and crimes of their creators.

===Nested plays===
This dramatic device was probably first used by [[Thomas Kyd]] in ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' around 1587, where the play is presented before an audience of two of the characters, who comment upon the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The action and characters in ''The Murder'' mirror the murder of Hamlet's father in the main action, and Prince Hamlet writes additional material to emphasize this. Hamlet wishes to provoke the murderer, his uncle, and sums this up by saying "the play's the thing wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king." Hamlet calls this new play ''The Mouse-trap'' (a title that [[Agatha Christie]] later took for the long-running play ''[[The Mousetrap]]''). The play ''I Hate Hamlet'' and the movie ''[[A Midwinter's Tale]]'' are about a production of ''Hamlet'', which in turn includes a production of ''The Murder of Gonzago'', as does the Hamlet-based film ''[[Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead (film)|Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' which even features a third-level puppet theatre version within their play. Similarly, in [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]'' there are specific allusions to ''[[Hamlet]]'': in the first act a son stages a play to impress his mother, a professional actress, and her new lover; the mother responds by comparing her son to Hamlet. Later he tries to come between them, as Hamlet had done with his mother and her new husband. The tragic developments in the plot follow in part from the scorn the mother shows for her son's play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Richard|editor=Miles, Patrick|title=Chekhov on the British stage  |year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|page=220|chapter=Chekhov into English: the case of 'The Seagull'|quote=A dominant motif in the play is the recurrent Hamlet theme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare adopted the play-within-a-play device for many of his other plays as well, including ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''and ''[[Love's Labours Lost]]''. Almost the whole of ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' is a play-within-a-play, presented to convince [[Christopher Sly]], a drunken tinker, that he is a nobleman watching a private performance, but the device has no relevance to the plot (unless Katharina's subservience to her "lord" in the last scene is intended to strengthen the deception against the tinker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aspinall|first=Dana |title=The Taming of the Shrew|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=2001|page=19|chapter=The play and the critics|isbn=978-0-8153-3515-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and is often dropped in modern productions. The musical ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'' is about the production of a [[List of Fictional Musicals|fictitious musical]], ''The Taming of the Shrew,'' based on the [[The Taming of the Shrew|Shakespeare play of the same name]], and features several scenes from it.  ''[[Pericles Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]'' draws in part on the 14th century ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' (itself a frame story) by [[John Gower]] and Shakespeare has the ghost of Gower "assume man's infirmities" to introduce his work to the contemporary audience and comment on the action of the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Judith|title=Shakespeare—Four late plays|year=2001|publisher=Wordsworth Editions|location=Ware, England|isbn=1-84022-104-6|pages=5–8|chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Francis Beaumont]]'s ''[[Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'' (ca. 1608) a supposed common citizen from the audience, actually a "planted" actor,  condemns the play that has just started and "persuades" the players to present something about a shopkeeper. The citizen's "apprentice" then acts, pretending to extemporise,  in the rest of the play. This is a satirical tilt at Beaumont's playwright contemporaries and their current fashion for offering plays about London life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurr|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Gurr|title=The Knight of the Burning Pestle|year=1968|publisher=Oliver and Boyd|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0050015710|pages=2–6|chapter=Critical introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera ''[[Pagliacci]]'' is about a troupe of actors who perform a play about marital infidelity that mirrors their own lives, and composer [[Richard Rodney Bennett]] and [[playwright]]-[[librettist]] [[Beverley Cross]]'s ''[[The Mines of Sulphur]]'' features a ghostly troupe of actors who perform a play about murder that similarly mirrors the lives of their hosts, from whom they depart, leaving them with the plague as nemesis. And John Adams' ''Nixon in China'' (1985-7) features a surreal version of Madam Mao's ''Red Detachment of Women'' to extraordinary effect, illuminating the ascendance of human values over the disillusionment of high politics in the meeting.

In [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[The Caucasian Chalk Circle]],'' a play is staged as a [[parable]] to villagers in the [[Soviet Union]] to justify the re-allocation of their farmland: the tale describes how a child is awarded to a servant-girl rather than its natural mother, an aristocrat, as the woman most likely to care for it well. This kind of play-within-a-play, which appears at the beginning of the main play and acts as a 'frame' for it, is called an ''[[Induction (play)|'induction']]''. Brecht's one-act play ''[[The Elephant Calf]]'' (1926) is a play-within-a-play performed in the foyer of the theatre during his ''[[Man Equals Man]]''.

In [[Jean Giraudoux]]'s play [[Ondine (play)|''Ondine'']], all of act two is a series of scenes within scenes, sometimes two levels deep. This increases the [[dramatic tension]] and also makes more poignant the inevitable failure of the relationship between the [[Human|mortal]] Hans and [[water sprite]] Ondine.

''[[The Two-Character Play]]'' by [[Tennessee Williams]] has a concurrent double plot with the convention of a play within a play. Felice and Clare are siblings and are both actor/producers touring ‘The Two-Character Play.’ They have supposedly been abandoned by their crew and have been left to put on the play by themselves. The characters in the play are also brother and sister and are also named Clare and Felice.

''[[The Mysteries (play)|The Mysteries]]'', a modern reworking of the medieval [[mystery play]]s, remains faithful to its roots by having the modern actors play the sincere, naïve tradesmen and women as they take part in the original performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Normington|first=Katie |title=Modern mysteries: contemporary productions of medieval English cycle dramas|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|location=Melton, Suffolk, England|date=October 2007|page=86|isbn=978-1-84384-128-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, a play might be about the production of a play, and include the performance of all or part of the play, as in ''[[Noises Off]]'', ''[[A Chorus of Disapproval (play)|A Chorus of Disapproval]]'' or ''[[Lilies (play)|Lilies]]''.  Similarly, the musical ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'' presents the story of Don Quixote as an impromptu play staged in prison by ''[[Don Quixote|Quixote]]'''s author, [[Miguel de Cervantes]].

In most stagings of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'', which include the song "Growltiger's Last Stand" — a recollection of an old play by Gus the Theatre Cat — the character of Lady [[Griddlebone]] sings "The Ballad of Billy McCaw". (However, many productions of the show omit "Growltiger's Last Stand", and "The Ballad of Billy McCaw" has at times been replaced with a mock aria, so this metastory isn't always seen.) Depending on the production, there is another musical scene called The Awful Battle of the Pekes and the Pollices where the Jellicles put on a show for their leader. In ''[[Lestat: The Musical]]'', there are three play within a plays. First, when Lestat visits his childhood friend, Nicolas, who works in a theater, where he discovers his love for theater; and two more when the Theater of the Vampires perform. One is used as a plot mechanism to explain the vampire god, Marius, which sparks an interest in Lestat to find him.

A play within a play also occurs in the musical ''[[The King and I]]'', where Princess Tuptim and the royal dancers give a performance of ''Small House of Uncle Thomas'' (or ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'') to their English guests. The play mirrors Tuptim's situation, as she wishes to run away from slavery to be with her lover, Lun Tha.

In stagings of [[Dina Rubina]]'s play ''Always the Same Dream'', the story is about staging a school play based on a poem by [[Pushkin]].

Joseph Heller's 1967 play ''[[We Bombed in New Haven]]'' is about actors engaged in a play about military airmen; the actors themselves become at times unsure whether they are actors or actual airmen.

The 1937 musical [[Babes in Arms]] is about a group of kids putting on a musical to raise money.  The central plot device was retained for the popular 1939 film version with [[Judy Garland]] and [[Mickey Rooney]].  A similar plot was recycled for the films [[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]] and [[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]].

===Nested films===

[[TV Tropes]] maintains a list of feature films that feature this plot device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ShowWithinAShow/LiveActionFilms |title=Live-Action Films / Show Within A Show |publisher=TV Tropes |date= |accessdate=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952) is frequently listed as the earliest example, although there are antecedents in silent cinema such as ''[[Mabel's Dramatic Career]]'' (1913).

The [[François Truffaut]] film ''[[Day for Night (film)|Day for Night]]'' is about the making of a fictitious movie called ''Meet Pamela'' (''Je vous présente Pamela'') and shows the interactions of the actors as they are making this movie about a woman who falls for her husband's father. The story of ''Pamela'' involves lust, betrayal, death, sorrow, and change, events that are mirrored in the experiences of the actors portrayed in ''Day for Night''.  There are a wealth of other movies that revolve around the film industry itself, even if not centering exclusively on one nested film.  These include the darkly satirical classic ''[[Sunset Boulevard]]'' about an aging star and her parasitic victim, and the Coen Brothers' farce ''[[Hail, Caesar!]]''

The script to [[Karel Reisz]]'s movie ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman (film)|The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'' (1981), written by [[Harold Pinter]], is a film-within-a-film adaptation of [[John Fowles]]'s book. In addition to the Victorian love story of the book, Pinter creates a present-day background story that shows a love affair between the main actors.

In [[Buster Keaton]]'s ''[[Sherlock, Jr.]]'', Keaton's protagonist actually enters into a film while it is playing in a cinema, as does the main character in the [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] children's film ''[[The Last Action Hero]]''.  A similar device is used in the seminal music video ''[[Take on me]]'' by [[A-ha]], which features a young woman entering a cartoon universe. Conversely, [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Purple Rose of Cairo]]'' is about a movie character exiting the movie to interact with the real world.  Allen's earlier film ''[[Play_It_Again,_Sam_(film)|Play it Again, Sam]]'' featured liberal use of characters, dialogue and clips from the film classic ''[[Casablanca_(film)|Casablanca]]'' as a central device.

The 2002 [[Pedro Almodóvar]] film ''[[Talk to Her]]'' (''Hable con ella'') has the chief character Benigno tell a story called ''The Shrinking Lover'' to Alicia, a long-term comatose patient whom Benigno, a male nurse, is assigned to care for. The film presents ''The Shrinking Lover'' in the form of a black-and-white silent melodrama. To prove his love to a scientist girlfriend, ''The Shrinking Lover'' protagonist drinks a potion that makes him progressively smaller. The resulting seven-minute scene, which is readily intelligible and enjoyable as a stand-alone short subject, is considerably more overtly comic than the rest of ''Talk to Her''—the protagonist climbs giant breasts as if they were rock formations and even ventures his way inside a (compared to him) gigantic vagina. Critics have noted that ''The Shrinking Lover'' essentially is a sex metaphor. Later in ''Talk to Her,'' the comatose Alicia is discovered to be pregnant and Benigno is sentenced to jail for rape. ''The Shrinking Lover'' was named [https://web.archive.org/web/20110728025551/http://skandies.org/skandies02.html Best Scene of 2002] in the ''Skandies'', an annual survey of online cinephiles and critics invited each year by critic Mike D'Angelo.

''[[Tropic Thunder]]'' (2008) is a [[comedy film]] revolving around a group of [[prima donna]] actors making a [[Vietnam War]] film (itself also named "Tropic Thunder") when their fed-up writer and director decide to abandon them in the middle of the jungle, forcing them to fight their way out.  The concept was perhaps inspired by the 1986 comedy [[Three Amigos]], where three washed-up silent film stars are expected to live out a real-life version of their old hit movies.  The same idea of life being forced to imitate art was also reprised in the [[Star Trek]] parody [[Galaxy Quest]].

The first episode of the [[anime]] series ''[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (anime)|The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya]]'' consists almost entirely of a poorly made film that the protagonists created, complete with [[Kyon]]'s typical, sarcastic commentary.

[[Chuck Jones]]'s 1953 [[cartoon]] ''[[Duck Amuck]]'' shows [[Daffy Duck]] trapped in a cartoon that an unseen animator repeatedly manipulates. At the end, it is revealed that the whole cartoon was being controlled by [[Bugs Bunny]]. The ''Duck Amuck'' plot was essentially replicated in one of Jones' later cartoons, ''[[Rabbit Rampage]]'' (1955), in which Bugs Bunny turns out to be the victim of the sadistic animator ([[Elmer Fudd]]). A similar plot was also included in an episode of ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]]'', in which Bugs was the victim, Daffy was the animator, and it was made on a computer instead of a pencil and paper. In 2007, the ''Duck Amuck'' sequence was parodied on ''[[Drawn Together]]'' ("Nipple Ring-Ring Goes to Foster Care").

All feature-length films by [[Jörg Buttgereit]] except ''[[Schramm (film)|Schramm]]'' feature a film within the film. In ''[[Nekromantik]]'', the protagonist goes to the cinema to see the fictional slasher film ''Vera''. In ''[[Der Todesking]]'' one of the character watches a video of the fictional Nazi exploitation film ''Vera - Todesengel der Gestapo'' and in ''[[Nekromantik 2]]'', the characters go to see a movie called ''Mon dejeuner avec Vera'' which is a parody of [[Louis Malle]]'s ''[[My Dinner with André]]''

[[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' depicts a [[Nazi propaganda]] film called ''[[Nation's Pride]]'', which glorifies a soldier in the German army.  ''Nation's Pride'' is directed by [[Eli Roth]].

[[Joe Dante]]'s ''[[Matinee (1993 film)|Matinee]]'' depicts ''Mant'', an early-'60s sci-fi/horror movie about a man who turns into an [[ant]].  In one scene, the protagonists see a [[Disney]]-style family movie called ''The Shook-Up Shopping Cart''.

====Story within a Film====
The 2002 martial arts epic [[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]] presented the same narrative several different times, as recounted by different storytellers, but with both factual and aesthetic differences.  Similarly, in the whimsical 1988 [[Terry Gilliam]] film [[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]], and the 2003 [[Tim Burton]] film [[Big Fish]], the bulk of the film is a series of stories told by an (extremely) unreliable narrator.  In the 2006 Tarsem film ''[[The Fall (2006 film)|The Fall]]'', an injured silent-movie stuntman tells [[heroic fantasy]] stories to a little girl with a broken arm to pass time in the hospital, which the film visualizes and presents with the stuntman's voice becoming voiceover narration. The fantasy tale bleeds back into and comments on the film's "present-tense" story. There are often incongruities based on the fact that the stuntman is an American and the girl Persian—the stuntman's voiceover refers to "Indians," “a squaw” and “a teepee,” but the visuals show a Bollywood-style devi and a Taj Mahal-like castle.  The same conceit of an unreliable narrator was used to very different effect in the 1995 crime drama [[The Usual Suspects]] (which garnered an Oscar for [[Kevin Spacey]]'s performance).

The seminal 1950 Japanese film ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'', based on the Japanese short story "[[In a Grove]]" (1921), utilizes the [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]-within-a-flashback technique. The story unfolds in flashback as the four witnesses in the story—the bandit, the murdered [[samurai]], his wife, and the nameless woodcutter—recount the events of one afternoon in a grove. But it is also a flashback within a flashback, because the accounts of the witnesses are being retold by a woodcutter and a priest to a ribald commoner as they wait out a rainstorm in a ruined gatehouse.

The movie ''[[Inception]]'' has a deeply nested structure that is itself part of the setting, as the characters travel deeper and deeper into layers of dreams within dreams.  Similarly, in the beginning of the music video for the [[Michael Jackson]] song "[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]", the heroine is terrorized by her monster boyfriend in what turns out to be a movie within a dream.  The film ''[[Grand Budapest Hotel]]'' has four layers of narration; starting with a young girl at the author's memorial reading his book, it cuts to the old author in 1985 telling of an incident in 1968 when he, as a young author, stayed at the hotel and met the owner, old Zero. He was then told the story of young Zero and M Gustave, from 1932, which makes up most of the narrative.

====Play within a film====
The 2001 film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' features a [[List of Fictional Musicals|fictitious musical]] within a film, called "Spectacular Spectacular". The 1942 [[Ernst Lubitsch]] comedy ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not to Be]]'' confuses the audience in the opening scenes with a play, "The Naughty Nazis", about Adolf Hitler which appears to be taking place within the actual plot of the film. Thereafter, the acting company players serve as the protagonists of the film and frequently use acting/costumes to deceive various characters in the film. ''[[Hamlet]]'' also serves as an important throughline in the film, as suggested by the title. [[Laurence Olivier]] sets the opening scene of his 1944 film of ''[[Henry V (1944 film)|Henry V]]'' in the [[Green room|tiring room]] of the old [[Globe Theatre]] as the actors prepare for their roles on stage. The early part of the film follows the actors in these "stage" performances and only later does the action almost imperceptibly expand to the full realism of the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. By way of increasingly more artificial sets (based on mediaeval paintings) the film finally returns to The Globe.  Mel Brook's film, ''[[The Producers (1968 film)|The Producers]]'', revolves around a scheme to make money by producing a disastrously bad Broadway musical, ''Springtime For Hitler.''  Ironically the film itself was later made into its own Broadway musical (although a more intentionally successful one). The [[Outkast]] music video for the song "Roses" is a short film about a high school musical.

The main plot device in ''[[Repo! The Genetic Opera]]'' is an opera which is going to be held the night of the events of the movie. All of the principal characters of the film play a role in the opera, though the audience watching the opera is unaware that some of the events portrayed are more than drama.

In ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]'',  the middle-schoolers put on a play of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.

The 1990 biopic [[Korczak (film)|Korczak]], about the last days of a Jewish children's orphanage in Nazi occupied Poland, features an amateur production of [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s ''The Post Office'', which was selected by the orphanage's visionary leader as a way of preparing his charges for their own impending death.  That same production is also featured in the stage play ''Korczak's Children,'' also inspired by the same historical events.

====TV Show within a Film====
The 1973 film adaptation&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Health (film)|''The National Health'' (film)]]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Peter Nichols]]'s 1969 play,&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Health (play)]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The National Health (play)|The National Health]]'' features a send-up of a typical American hospital [[soap-opera]] being shown on a television situated in an underfunded, unmistakably [[United Kingdom|British]] [[National Health Service|NHS]] hospital.

The Jim Carey film [[The Truman Show]] is about a person who grows to adulthood without ever realizing that he is the unwitting hero of the immersive eponymous television show.

===Nested video games===
{{main|Minigame}}

The first example of a video game within a video game is almost certainly [[Tim Stryker]]'s 80s era text-only game Fazuul (also the world's first online multiplayer game), in which one of the objects that the player can create is a minigame.  Another early use of this trope was in [[Cliff Johnson (game designer)|Cliff Johnson]]'s 1987 hit [[The Fool's Errand]], a thematically linked narrative puzzle game, in which several of the puzzles were semi-independent games played against NPCs.

''[[Power Factor (video game)|Power Factor]]'' has been cited as a rare example of a video game in which the entire concept is a video game within a video game: The player takes on the role of a character who is playing a "Virtual Reality Simulator", in which he in turn takes on the role of the hero Redd Ace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=ProReview: Power Factor |magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=55|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1993 |page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[.hack]]'' franchise also gives the concept a central role. It features a narrative in which internet advancements have created an MMORPG franchise called The World. Protagonists Kite and [[Haseo]] try to uncover the mysteries of the events surrounding The World. Characters in .hack are self-aware that they are video game characters.

More commonly, however, the video game within a video game device takes the form of mini-games that are non-plot oriented, and optional to the completion of the game. For example, in the ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]]'' and ''[[Shenmue (series)|Shenmue]]'' franchises, there are playable arcade machines featuring other Sega games that are scattered throughout the game world.

In ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' there are several video games that can be played in an arcade in the Gold Saucer theme park. In ''[[Animal Crossing]]'', the player can acquire individual NES emulations through various means and place them within their house, where they are playable in their entirety. When placed in the house, the games take the form of a [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. In ''[[Fallout 4]]'', the protagonist can find several cartridges throughout the wasteland that can be played on his pip-boy (an electronic device that exists only in the world of the game) or any terminal computer.

====TV show within a video game====
In the [[Remedy Entertainment|Remedy]] video game title ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]'' players can chance upon a number of ongoing television shows when activating or happening upon various television sets within the game environs, depending on where / when they are within the unfolding game narrative will dictate which episode of what show is found. Among them are ''[[Lords &amp; Ladies]]'', ''[[Captain Baseball Bat Boy]]'', ''[[Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne|Dick Justice]]'' and the pinnacle television serial ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Address Unknown]]'' -heavily inspired by David Lynch style film narrative, particularly ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', Address Unknown sometimes prophesies events or character motives yet to occur in the Max Payne narrative.

In ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', the player can watch several TV channels which include many programs: reality shows, cartoons, and even game shows.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2008/04/watching-tv-and/ Grand Theft Auto IV Shifts Into Media Overdrive].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nested TV shows===
''[[Terrance &amp; Phillip]]'' from ''[[South Park]]'' comments on the levels of violence and acceptable behaviour in the media and allow criticism of the outer cartoon to be addressed in the cartoon itself. Similarly, on the long running animated sitcom, ''[[The Simpsons]]'', Bart's favorite cartoon, ''[[Itchy and Scratchy]]'' (a parody of ''[[Tom &amp; Jerry]]''), often echoes the plotlines of the main show.  ''[[The Simpsons]]'' also parodied this structure with numerous 'layers' of sub-stories in the Season 17 episode "[[The Seemingly Never-Ending Story]]".

On the show ''[[Dear White People (TV series)|Dear White People]]'', the ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]'' parody ''Defamation'' offers a ironic commentary on the main show's theme of interracial relationships.  Similarly, on the HBO show ''[[Insecure (TV series)|Insecure]]'' the slavery-era soap opera ''Due North'' is an obsession for the show's main characters.

The [[Ireland|Irish]] television series ''[[Father Ted]]'' features a television show, ''Father Ben'', which has characters and storylines almost identical to that of Father Ted.

The television shows ''[[30 Rock]]'', ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]'', ''[[Sonny with a Chance]]'', and ''[[Kappa Mikey]]'' feature a sketch show within the TV show.

An extended plotline on the semi-autobiographical sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'' dealt with the main characters developing a sitcom about their lives.  The gag was reprised on ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', another semi-autobiographical show by and about ''Seinfeld'' co-creator Larry David, when the long-anticipated ''Seinfeld'' reunion was staged entirely inside the new show.

The ''[[USS Callister]]'' episode of the ''[[Black Mirror]]'' anthology television series is about a man obsessed with a Star-Trek like show, who recreates it as part of a virtual reality game.

The concept of a film within a television series is employed in the [[Macross]] universe. ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?]]'' (1984) was originally intended as an alternative theatrical re-telling of the television series ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' (1982), but was later "[[Retroactive continuity|retconned]]" into the Macross [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] as a popular movie within the television series ''[[Macross 7]]'' (1994).

====Film within a TV show====

''Seinfeld'' had a number of reoccurring fictional films, most notably ''Rochelle, Rochelle'', a parody of artsy but exploitative foreign films, while the trippy, metaphysically loopy thriller ''Death Castle'' is a central element of the ''[[Master of None]]'' episode ''New York, I Love You.''

==Fantasy within Realism==

Stories inside stories can allow for genre changes.  [[Arthur Ransome]] uses the device to let his young characters in the ''[[Swallows and Amazons series]]'' of children's books, set in the recognisable everyday world, take part in fantastic adventures of piracy in distant lands: two of the twelve books, ''[[Peter Duck]]'' and ''[[Missee Lee]]'' (and some would include ''[[Great Northern?]]'' as a third), are adventures supposedly made up by the characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | id =
  | isbn = 0-224-02590-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the film version of ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' uses a story within a story format to tell a purely fantastic fairy tale within a relatively more realistic frame-story.  The film version of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' does the same thing by making its inner story into a dream.  Lewis Carroll's celebrated ''[[Alice_(Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland)|Alice]]'' books use the same device of a dream as an excuse for fantasy, while Carroll's less well-known ''[[Sylvie and Bruno]]'' subverts the trope by allowing the dream figures to enter and interact with the "real" world.
==Fractal Fiction==
Some stories feature what might be called a literary version of the [[Droste effect]], where an image contains a smaller version of itself (also a common feature in many [[fractals]]).  Among the stories that include versions of themselves are [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman: Worlds' End]]'' which contains several instances of multiple storytelling levels, including ''Cerements'' (issue #55) where one of the inmost levels corresponds to one of the outer levels, turning the story-within-a-story structure into an infinite regression. Similarly, in [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s 2008 film ''[[Synecdoche, New York]]'', the main character Caden Cotard is a skilled director of plays who receives a grant, and ends up creating a remarkable theater piece intended as a carbon copy of the outside world.  The layers of copies of the world ends up several layers deep.

The long-running musical [[A Chorus Line]] dramatizes its own creation, and the life stories of its own original cast members.  The famous final number does double duty as the showstopper for both the musical the audience is watching and the one the characters are appearing in.

Michael Ende's classic children's novel [[The Neverending Story]] prominently features a book of the same title.  This is later revealed to be the same book the audience is reading, when it begins to be retold again from the beginning, thus creating an infinite regression that features as a plot element.  Similarly, in the Will Ferrell comedy [[Stranger_than_Fiction_(2006_film)|Stranger than Fiction]] the main character discovers he is a character in a book that (along with its author) also exists in the same universe.

In [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', there is a narrative between [[Achilles and the Tortoise]] (characters borrowed from [[Lewis Carroll]], who in turn borrowed them from [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]]), and within this story they find a book entitled "Provocative Adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise Taking Place in Sundry Spots of the Globe", which they begin to read, the Tortoise taking the part of the Tortoise, and Achilles taking the part of Achilles. Within this narrative, which itself is somewhat self-referential, the two characters find a book entitled "Provocative Adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise Taking Place in Sundry Spots of the Globe", which they begin to read, the Tortoise taking the part of Achilles, and Achilles taking the part of the Tortoise.

The music video for the [[Björk]] song "[[Bachelorette (song)|Bachelorette]]" features a musical that is about, in part, the creation of that musical. A mini-theater and small audience appear on stage to watch the musical-within-a-musical, and at some point, within that second musical a yet-smaller theater and audience appear.

Episode 14 of the [[anime]] series ''[[Martian Successor Nadesico]]'' is essentially a clip show, but has several newly animated segments based on ''[[Gekigangar III]]'', an anime that exists within its universe and that many characters are fans of, that involves the characters of that show watching Nadesico. The episode ends with the crew of the Nadesico watching the very same episode of Gekigangar, causing a [[paradox]].

''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' begins with an action film opening, which turns out to be a sequence being filmed by [[Steven Spielberg]].  Near the ending, the events of the film itself are revealed to be a movie being enjoyed by the characters. The 1985 Tim Burton film [[Pee-Wee's Big Adventure]] ends with the main characters watching a film version of their own adventures, but as reimagined as a Hollywood blockbuster action film, with [[James Brolin]] as a more stereotypically manly version of the [[Paul Reubens]] title character.  [[Mel Brooks]]'s 1974 comedy ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' leaves its Western setting when the climactic fight scene breaks out, revealing the setting to have been a set in the [[Warner Bros.]] studio lot; the fight spills out onto an adjacent musical set, then into the studio canteen, and finally onto the streets. The two protagonists arrive at [[Grauman's Chinese Theater]], which is showing the "premiere" of ''Blazing Saddles''; they enter the cinema to watch the conclusion of their own film.  Brooks recycled the gag in his 1987 ''[[Star Wars]]'' parody, ''[[Spaceballs]]'', where the villains are able to locate the heroes by watching a copy of the movie they are in on VHS video tape (a comic exaggeration of the phenomenon of films being available on video before their theatrical release).  Brooks also made the 1976 parody ''[[Silent Movie]]'' about a buffoonish team of filmmakers trying to make the first Hollywood silent film in forty years --which is essentially that film itself (another forty years later, life imitated art imitating art, when an actual modern silent movie became a hit, the Oscar nominated ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'').

In the latter two films of the ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'' horror trilogy, a film-within-a-film format is used when the events of the first film spawn their own horror trilogy within the films themselves. In ''[[Scream 2]]'', characters get killed while watching a film version of the events in the first ''Scream'' film, while in ''[[Scream 3]]'' the actors playing the trilogy's characters end up getting killed, much in the same way as the characters they are playing on screen. In the latest ''Scream'' movie, ''[[Scream 4]]'', in the opening sequence, two characters are watching Stab 7 before they get killed. Also, the characters of Stab 7 are watching Stab 6. There's also a party in which all seven Stab movies were going to be shown. References are also made to Stab 5 involving [[time travel]] as a plot device.

Director [[Spike Jonze]]'s ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation]]'' is a fictionalized version of screenwriter [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s struggles to adapt the non-cinematic book ''[[The Orchid Thief]]'' into a Hollywood blockbuster.  As his onscreen self succumbs to the temptation to commercialize the narrative, Kaufman incorporates those techniques into the script, including tropes such as an invented romance, a car chase, a drug-running sequence, and an imaginary identical twin for the protagonist. (The movie also features scenes about the making of ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'', previously written by Kaufman and directed by Jonze.)  Robert Altman's satirical noir ''[[The Player (film)|The Player]]'' about Hollywood ends with the antihero being pitched a movie version of his own story, complete with an unlikely happy ending.

==From story within a story to separate story==
Occasionally a story within a story becomes such a popular element that the producer(s) decide to develop it autonomously as a separate and distinct work. This is an example of a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]].

In the fictional world of the ''[[Toy Story]]'' movies, [[Buzz Lightyear]] is an animated toy action figure, which was based on a fictitious cartoon series, ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'', which did not exist in the real world except for snippets seen within ''Toy Story''. Later, ''Buzz Lightyear of Star Command'' was produced in the real world.

''[[Kujibiki Unbalance]]'', a series in the ''[[Genshiken]]'' universe, has spawned merchandise of its own, and been remade into a series on its own.

Such spin-offs may be produced as a way of providing additional information on the fictional world for fans. In the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, three such supplemental books have been produced. ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' is a textbook used by the main character, and ''[[Quidditch Through the Ages]]'' is a book from the library at his school. ''[[The Tales of Beedle the Bard]]'' provides an additional layer of fiction, the 'tales' being instructional stories told to children in the characters' world.

In the works of [[Kurt Vonnegut]], [[Kilgore Trout]] has written a novel called ''[[Venus on the Half-Shell]]''. In 1975 real-world author [[Philip José Farmer]] wrote a science-fiction novel called ''Venus on the Half-Shell'', published under the name Kilgore Trout.

In ''[[Homestuck]]'' by [[Andrew Hussie]], there is a comic called [[Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff]], created by one of the characters, Dave Strider. It was later adapted to its own ongoing series.

''Captain Proton: Defender of the Earth'', a story by [[Dean Wesley Smith]], was adapted from the holonovel ''[[Captain Proton]]'' in the [[Star Trek]] universe.

In the animated online franchise ''[[Homestar Runner]]'' many of the best-known features were spun off from each other.  The best known was "Strong Bad Emails," which depicted the villain of the original story giving snarky answers to fan emails, but that in turn spawned several other long-running features which started out as figments of Strong Bad's imagination, including the teen-oriented cartoon parody "Teen Girl Squad" and the anime parody "20X6."

One unique example is the [[Tyler Perry]] comedy/horror hit ''[[Boo! A Madea Halloween]]'' which originated as a parody of Tyler Perry films in the [[Chris Rock]] film ''[[Top 5]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4703">'''Symbolic boundaries''' are a theory of how people form social groups proposed by [[cultural sociology|cultural sociologists]].
Symbolic boundaries are “conceptual distinctions made by social actors…that separate people into groups and generate feelings of similarity and group membership.”&lt;ref name=LamontMolnar2002&gt;[[Michele Lamont|Lamont, Michele]] and Virag Molnar. 2002. "The Study of Boundaries in the Social Sciences" Annual Review of Sociology. 28:167-95&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolic boundaries are a necessary but insufficient condition for social change. Only when symbolic boundaries are widely agreed upon can they take on a constraining character and become social boundaries.&lt;ref name=LamontMolnar2002/&gt;

==Durkheim==

[[Émile Durkheim]] saw the symbolic boundary between sacred and profane as the most profound of all social facts, and the one from which lesser symbolic boundaries were derived.&lt;ref&gt;Emile Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'' (1971[1915]) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ritual]]s - secular or religious - were for Durkheim the means by which groups maintained their symbolic/moral boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Allen, ''Explorations in Classical Sociological Theory'' (2009) p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Mary Douglas]] has subsequently emphasised the role of symbolic boundaries in organising experience, private and public, even in a secular society;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Douglas, ''Natural Symbols'' (2002) p. 50-1&lt;/ref&gt; while other neo-Durkheimians highlight the role of [[Deviance (sociology)|deviancy]] as one of revealing and making plain the symbolic boundaries that uphold moral order, and of providing an opportunity for  their communal reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Annalee R. Ward, '' Mouse Morality'' (2002) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; As Durkheim himself put it, "Crime brings together upright consciences and concentrates them...to talk of the event and wax indignant in common",&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Peter Worsley ed., ''The New Modern Sociology Readings'' (1991) p. 480&lt;/ref&gt; thereby reaffirming the collective barriers that have been breached.

==Transgressing boundaries==

[[Prejudice]] is often the result of crossing the symbolic boundaries that preserve a group's sense of itself - boundaries that as with a nation's frontiers may in fact be real as well as symbolic.&lt;ref&gt;C. Cunningham, ''Prejudice'' (2000) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; (The ancient ceremony of [[beating the bounds]] highlights that overlapping of real and symbolic bounds).&lt;ref&gt;[[François Laroque]], ''Shakespeare's Festive World'' (1991) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salman Rushdie]] has emphasised the role of the migrant as a [[Postmodernity|postmodern]] representative, transgressing symbolic boundaries, and (potentially at least) demonised by their upholders in the host nation as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Salman Rushdie, ''Imaginary Homelands'' (1991) p. 278-9 and p. 402&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marjorie Garber]] has explored the role of the [[Transvestism|transvestite]] in crossing the symbolic boundaries of gender - something which she considered tended to challenge those of race as well.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (1994) p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolic/social boundaries==

Symbolic boundaries are distinct from “social boundaries" that are "objectified forms of social differences manifested in unequal access to an unequal distribution of resources… and social opportunities.”&lt;ref name=LamontMolnar2002/&gt;

==Play==

[[Play (activity)|Playing]] may be seen as a way of testing social boundaries - the unspoken [[Frame analysis|frames]] set about social activities.&lt;ref&gt;Gerry Bloustien, ''Girl Making'' (2003) p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Humour too provides a way of illuminating, testing and perhaps also shifting symbolic boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;P. Morey/A. Yaqin, ''Framing Muslims'' (2011) p. 199-204&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural examples==

* [[Michael Jackson]], in Garber's opinion, erases and detraumatises not only the boundaries between male and female, youth and age, but also between black and white internalising cultural category crises.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Phillips, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3771">'''Theory of functional systems''' - is a model that describes the structure of [[Behavior|conduct]], which was established by Russian and Soviet biologist and physiologist [[Pyotr Anokhin]].
Functional systems were put forward by Anokhin as an alternative to the predominant concept of [[reflexes]]. Contrary to reflexes, the endpoints of functional systems are not actions themselves but ''adaptive results of these actions''. In contrast to reflexes, which are based on ''linear spread of information'' from receptors to executive organs through the central nervous system, functional systems are [[self-organizing]] [[non-linear]] systems composed of synchronized distributed elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keldysh.ru/pages/mrbur-web/publ/IJCNN04.pdf V.G.Red’ko, D.V.Prokhorov, M.B.Burtsev], ''Theory of Functional Systems, Adaptive Critics and Neural Networks'', in Proceedings of International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, Budapest, 2004, pp.1787-1792&lt;/ref&gt;

"The principle of functional systems" - association of private mechanisms of the body in a [[holistic]] system of adaptive behavioral act, the establishment of "integrative unity". 

There are two types of functional systems: 
* System of the first type provide [[homeostasis]] due to internal (existing) resources of the body, inside its boundaries (e.g. blood pressure). 
* System of a second type supports homeostasis due to a change of behavior, interaction with the outside world and are the basis of different types of behavior.

== Stages of the behavioral act ==
[[File:Theory of Functional Systems (m) .png|680px|right]]
*[[Afferent synthesis]]
*:Any excitement in the central nervous system there is in interaction with other excitations: the brain analyzes these excitations. Synthesis determines the following factors: 
**[[Motivation]] 
**Pad afferentation (excitation caused by conditioned and unconditioned stimuli) 
**Situational afferentation (arousal from familiar surroundings, causing a reflex, and dynamic stereotypes) 
**[[Memory]] (of species and individual) 
*Decision-making 
** The formation of action result acceptor (creating the ideal image and its retention goals, presumably, at the physiological level is circulating in the ring interneuron excitation) 
**[[Efferent synthesis]] (or the stage of the program, integration of somatic and autonomic excitations in a single behavioral act. The action is formed, but is not manifested externally) 
*[[Action theory (philosophy)|Action]] (program execution behavior) 
*Evaluation result of the action 
*:At this stage, comparison of the actual running of the ideal image created during the formation of acceptor result of the action (the reverse occurs afferentation) based on a comparison of the action, or adjusted, or terminated. 
*Meeting the needs (authorizing termination of stage) 

Choice of targets and methods of achieving them are the key factors that regulate behavior. According to Anokhin, in the structure of the behavioral act afferent feedback compared with the acceptor of the result gives a positive or negative ''situational'' [[emotions]] affect the correction or termination of action (another type of emotion, ''leading'' emotions, are associated with satisfaction or dissatisfaction needs in general, with the formation of the target). In addition, the behavior affect the memories of positive and negative emotions. 

In general, behavioral act is characterized by meaningful and active role of the subject.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30045">'''Universal grammar''' ('''UG''') in [[linguistics]], is the theory of the [[genetics|genetic]] component of the [[language faculty]], usually credited to [[Noam Chomsky]]. The basic postulate of UG is that a certain set of [[Grammar|structural rules]] are [[A priori and a posteriori|innate]] to humans, independent of [[sensory experience]]. With more linguistic stimuli received in the course of [[psychological development]], children then adopt specific [[syntactic rule]]s that conform to UG.&lt;ref name="toolmodule2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/outil_rouge06.html|title=Tool Module: Chomsky's Universal Grammar|author=Noam Chomsky|accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes known as "mental grammar", and stands contrasted with other "grammars", e.g. [[Prescriptive grammar|prescriptive]], [[Descriptive grammar|descriptive]] and [[Pedagogical grammar|pedagogical]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An A-Z of ELT|date=2006|publisher=Macmillan Education|isbn=1-4050-7063-3|page=92|last1=Thornbury|first1=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04v382j|title=First Words: How do children develop language?|date=16 December 2014|work=BBC Radio 4|department=Word of Mouth|last1=Szendroi|first1=Kriszta|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advocates of this theory emphasize and partially rely on [[Poverty of the stimulus|the poverty of the stimulus]] (POS) argument and the existence of some universal properties of natural [[human languages]]. However, the latter has not been firmly established, as some linguists have argued languages are so diverse that such universality is rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |last2=Levinson |first2=Stephen C. |title=The myth of language universals: Language diversity and its importance for cognitive science |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |date=26 October 2009 |volume=32 |issue=05 |pages=429-48 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X0999094X |pmid=19857320 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-myth-of-language-universals%3A-language-diversity-Evans-Levinson/1202032fc27b5da12362d82d48eed5e1c34c166f |dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727171702/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1f31/330319b363499ec974b27b7678d96025cde9.pdf |archivedate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a matter of empirical investigation to determine precisely what properties are universal and what linguistic capacities are innate.

== Argument ==
The theory of universal grammar proposes that if human beings are brought up under normal conditions (not those of extreme [[sensory deprivation]]), then they will always develop language with certain properties (e.g., distinguishing [[noun]]s from [[verb]]s, or distinguishing [[function word]]s from [[content word]]s). The theory proposes that there is an innate, genetically determined language faculty that knows these rules, making it easier and faster for children to learn to speak than it otherwise would be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/outil_rouge06.html|title=Tool Module: Chomsky’s Universal Grammar|website=thebrain.mcgill.ca|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This faculty does not know the vocabulary of any particular language (so words and their meanings must be learned), and there remain several parameters which can vary freely among languages (such as whether adjectives come before or after nouns) which must also be learned.

As Chomsky puts it, "Evidently, development of language in the individual must involve three factors: (1) genetic endowment, which sets limits on the attainable languages, thereby making language acquisition possible; (2) external data, converted to the experience that selects one or another language within a narrow range; (3) principles not specific to the Faculty of Language."&lt;ref name="Chomsky 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |year=2007 |chapter=Approaching UG from Below |title=Interfaces + Recursion = Language? Chomsky's Minimalism and the View from Syntax-Semantics |series=Studies in Generative Grammar |editor=Hans-Martin Gärtner |editor2=Uli Sauerland |publisher=Mouton de Gruyter |location=Berlin |isbn=978-3-11-018872-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, aspects of universal grammar seem describable in terms of general details regarding cognition. For example, if a predisposition to categorize events and objects as different classes of things is part of human cognition, and directly results in nouns and verbs showing up in all languages, then it could be assumed that rather than this aspect of universal grammar being specific to language, it is more generally a part of human cognition. To distinguish properties of languages that can be traced to other facts regarding cognition from properties of languages that cannot, the abbreviation UG* can be used. UG is the term often used by Chomsky for those aspects of the human brain which cause language to be the way that it is (i.e. are universal grammar in the sense used here) but here for discussion, it is used for those aspects which are furthermore specific to language (thus UG, as Chomsky uses it, is just an abbreviation for universal grammar, but UG* as used here is a subset of universal grammar).

In the same article, Chomsky casts the theme of a larger research program in terms of the following question: "How little can be attributed to UG while still accounting for the variety of 'I-languages' attained, relying on third factor principles?" (I-languages meaning internal languages, the brain states that correspond to knowing how to speak and understand a particular language, and third factor principles meaning (3) in the previous quote).

Chomsky has speculated that UG might be extremely simple and abstract, for example only a mechanism for combining symbols in a particular way, which he calls "[[Merge (linguistics)|merge]]". The following quote shows that Chomsky does not use the term "UG" in the narrow sense UG* suggested above:

"The conclusion that merge falls within UG holds whether such recursive generation is unique to FL (faculty of language) or is
appropriated from other systems."

In other words, merge is seen as part of UG because it causes language to be the way it is, universal, and is not part of the environment or general properties independent of genetics and environment. Merge is part of universal grammar whether it is specific to language, or whether, as Chomsky suggests, it is also used for an example in mathematical thinking.

The distinction is important because there is a long history of argument about UG*, whereas most people working on language agree that there is universal grammar. Many people assume that Chomsky means UG* when he writes UG (and in some cases he might actually mean UG* [though not in the passage quoted above]).

Some students of universal grammar study a variety of grammars to extract generalizations called [[linguistic universal]]s, often in the form of "If X holds true, then Y occurs." These have been extended to a variety of traits, such as the phonemes found in languages, the word orders which languages choose, and the reasons why children exhibit certain linguistic behaviors.

Later linguists who have influenced this theory include Chomsky and [[Richard Montague]], developing their version of this theory as they considered issues of the [[argument from poverty of the stimulus]] to arise from the constructivist approach to linguistic theory. The application of the idea of universal grammar to the study of second language acquisition (SLA) is represented mainly in the work of McGill linguist [[Lydia White]].

Syntacticians generally hold that there are parametric points of variation between languages, although heated debate occurs over whether UG constraints are essentially universal due to being "hard-wired" (Chomsky's [[principles and parameters]] approach), a [[logical consequence]] of a specific syntactic architecture (the [[GPSG|generalized phrase structure]] approach) or the result of functional constraints on communication (the [[systemic functional linguistics|functionalist]] approach).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mark C.

== Relation to the evolution of language ==

In an article titled, "The Faculty of Language: What Is It, Who Has It, and How Did It Evolve?"&lt;ref name="Hauser"&gt;{{Citation | last = Hauser | first = Marc | last2 = Chomsky | first2 = Noam | author2-link = Noam Chomsky | last3 = Fitch | first3 = William Tecumseh | author3-link = W. Tecumseh Fitch | title = The Faculty of Language:  What Is It, Who Has It, and How Did It Evolve? | journal = Science | volume = 298 | pages = 1569–1579 | date = 22 November 2002 | url = http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021122.pdf | doi = 10.1126/science.298.5598.1569 | pmid = 12446899 | issue = 5598 | access-date = 28 December 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131228122250/http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021122.pdf | archive-date = 28 December 2013 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch present the three leading hypotheses for how language evolved and brought humans to the point where they have a universal grammar.

The first hypothesis states that the faculty of language in the broad sense (FLb) is strictly homologous to animal communication.
This means that homologous aspects of the faculty of language exist in non-human animals.

The second hypothesis states that the FLb is a derived, uniquely human, adaptation for language. This hypothesis holds that individual traits were subject to natural selection and came to be specialized for humans.

The third hypothesis states that only the faculty of language in the narrow sense (FLn) is unique to humans. It holds that while mechanisms of the FLb are present in both human and non-human animals, the computational mechanism of recursion is recently evolved solely in humans.&lt;ref name="Hauser" /&gt; This is the hypothesis which most closely aligns to the typical theory of universal grammar championed by Chomsky.

== History ==
The idea of a universal grammar can be traced back to [[Roger Bacon]]'s observations in his {{circa|lk=no|1245}} ''[[Overview of Grammar]]'' and {{circa|lk=no|1268}} ''[[Grammatica Graeca|Greek Grammar]]'' that all languages are built upon a common grammar, even though it may undergo incidental variations; and the 13th century [[speculative grammar]]ians who, following Bacon, postulated universal rules underlying all grammars. The concept of a universal grammar or language was at the core of the 17th century projects for [[philosophical language]]s. There is a Scottish school of universal grammarians from the 18th century, as distinguished from the philosophical language project, which included authors such as [[James Beattie (writer)|James Beattie]], [[Hugh Blair]], [[James Burnett]], [[James Harris (grammarian)|James Harris]], and [[Adam Smith]]. The article on grammar in the first edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (1771) contains an extensive section titled "Of Universal Grammar".

The idea rose to prominence and influence, in modern linguistics with theories from Chomsky and Montague in the 1950s–1970s, as part of the "[[linguistics wars]]".

During the early 20th century, in contrast, language was usually understood from a [[behaviourist]] perspective, suggesting that language acquisition, like any other kind of learning, could be explained by a succession of trials, errors, and rewards for success.&lt;ref name=toolmodule&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, children learned their mother tongue by simple imitation, through listening and repeating what adults said.  For example, when a child says "milk" and the mother will smile and give her some as a result, the child will find this outcome rewarding, thus enhancing the child's language development.&lt;ref&gt;Ambridge &amp; Lieven, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chomsky's theory ==

{{further|Language acquisition device|Generative grammar|X-bar theory|Government and binding|Principles and parameters|Minimalist program}}
Chomsky argued that the [[human brain]] contains a limited set of constraints for organizing language. This implies in turn that all languages have a common structural basis: the set of rules known as "universal grammar".

Speakers proficient in a language know which expressions are acceptable in their language and which are unacceptable. The key puzzle is how speakers come to know these restrictions of their language, since expressions that violate those restrictions are not present in the input, indicated as such. Chomsky argued that this [[poverty of stimulus]] means that Skinner's behaviourist perspective cannot explain language acquisition. The absence of negative evidence—evidence that an expression is part of a class of ungrammatical sentences in a given language—is the core of his argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/static/5007/sasspdf/whatexactlyisUG.pdf|title=What exactly is Universal Grammar, and has anyone seen it?|last=Northumbria University|first=Ewa Dąbrowska|date=|website=www.northumbria.ac.uk|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in English, an interrogative pronoun like ''what'' cannot be related to a predicate within a relative clause:

: *"What did John meet a man who sold?"

Such expressions are not available to language learners: they are, by hypothesis, ungrammatical. Speakers of the local language do not use them, or note them as unacceptable to language learners. Universal grammar offers an explanation for the presence of the poverty of the stimulus, by making certain restrictions into universal characteristics of human languages. Language learners are consequently never tempted to generalize in an illicit fashion.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

== Presence of creole languages ==

The presence of [[creole language]]s is sometimes cited as further support for this theory, especially by [[Derek Bickerton|Bickerton's]] controversial [[language bioprogram theory]]. Creoles are languages that develop and form when disparate societies come together and are forced to devise a new system of communication. The system used by the original speakers is typically an inconsistent mix of vocabulary items, known as a [[pidgin]]. As these speakers' children begin to acquire their first language, they use the pidgin input to effectively create their own original language, known as a [[Creole language|creole]]. Unlike pidgins, creoles have [[native speaker]]s (those with acquisition from early childhood) and make use of a full, systematic grammar.

According to Bickerton, the idea of universal grammar is supported by creole languages because certain features are shared by virtually all in the category. For example, their default point of reference in time (expressed by bare verb stems) is not the present moment, but the past. Using pre-verbal [[auxiliary verb|auxiliaries]], they uniformly express [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], and [[grammatical mood|mood]]. [[Negative concord]] occurs, but it affects the verbal subject (as opposed to the object, as it does in languages like [[Spanish language|Spanish]]). Another similarity among creoles can be seen in the fact that questions are created simply by changing the intonation of a declarative sentence, not its word order or content.

However, extensive work by Carla Hudson-Kam and Elissa Newport suggests that creole languages may not support a universal grammar at all. In a series of experiments, Hudson-Kam and Newport looked at how children and adults learn artificial grammars. They found that children tend to ignore minor variations in the input when those variations are infrequent, and reproduce only the most frequent forms. In doing so, they tend to standardize the language that they hear around them. Hudson-Kam and Newport hypothesize that in a pidgin-development situation (and in the real-life situation of a deaf child whose parents are or were disfluent signers), children systematize the language they hear, based on the probability and frequency of forms, and not that which has been suggested on the basis of a universal grammar.&lt;ref name="Kam"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hudson Kam | first1 = C.

Many researchers of universal grammar argue against a concept of [[relexification]], which says that a language replaces its lexicon almost entirely with that of another. This goes against universalist ideas of a universal grammar, which has an innate grammar.

== Criticisms ==
[[Geoffrey Sampson]] maintains that universal grammar theories are not [[falsifiable]] and are therefore [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]]. He argues that the grammatical "rules" linguists posit are simply post-hoc observations about existing languages, rather than predictions about what is possible in a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sampson |first=Geoffrey |year=2005 |title=The 'Language Instinct' Debate: Revised Edition |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-0-8264-7385-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Jeffrey Elman]] argues that the unlearnability of languages assumed by universal grammar is based on a too-strict, "worst-case" model of grammar, that is not in keeping with any actual grammar. In keeping with these points, James Hurford argues that the postulate of a [[language acquisition device]] (LAD) essentially amounts to the trivial claim that languages are learnt by humans, and thus, that the LAD is less a theory than an [[explanandum]] looking for theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=James R. Hurford |chapter=Nativist and Functional Explanations in Language Acquisition |editor=I. M. Roca |title=Logical Issues in Language Acquisition |publisher=Foris Publications |location=Dordrecht, Holland and Providence, Rhode Island |year=1995 |page=88 |url=http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~jim/rocapaper.pdf |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morten H. Christiansen]] and Nick Chater have argued that the relatively fast-changing nature of language would prevent the slower-changing genetic structures from ever catching up, undermining the possibility of a genetically hard-wired universal grammar. Instead of an innate universal grammar, they claim, "apparently arbitrary aspects of linguistic structure may result from general learning and processing biases deriving from the structure of thought processes, perceptuo-motor factors, cognitive limitations, and pragmatics".&lt;ref name="Christiansen, Morten H 2008"&gt;Christiansen, Morten H. and [[Chater, Nick]]. "Language as Shaped by the Brain". ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 31.5 (2008): 489–509.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hinzen summarizes the most common criticisms of universal grammar:
* Universal grammar has no coherent formulation and is indeed unnecessary.
* Universal grammar is in conflict with biology: it cannot have evolved by standardly accepted [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]] evolutionary principles.
* There are no linguistic universals: universal grammar is refuted by abundant variation at all levels of linguistic organization, which lies at the heart of human faculty of language.&lt;ref name="Hinzen"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hinzen |first=Wolfram |title=The philosophical significance of Universal Grammar |journal=Language Sciences |volume=34 |issue=5 |date=September 2012 |pages=635–649 |doi=10.1016/j.langsci.2012.03.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, it has been suggested that people learn about probabilistic patterns of word distributions in their language, rather than hard and fast rules (see [[Distributional hypothesis]]).&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McDonald |first=Scott |last2=Ramscar |first2=Michael |year=2001 |title=Testing the distributional hypothesis: The influence of context on judgements of semantic similarity |journal=Proceedings of the 23rd Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society |pages=611–616 |accessdate=June 10, 2014 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.104.7535}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, children overgeneralize the past tense marker "ed" and conjugate irregular verbs incorrectly, producing forms like ''goed'' and ''eated'' and correct these errors over time.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fernández |first=Eva M. |author2=Helen Smith Cairns |title=Fundamentals of Psycholinguistics |location=Chichester, West Sussex, England:  |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4051-9147-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been proposed that the poverty of the stimulus problem can be largely avoided, if it is assumed that children employ ''similarity-based generalization'' strategies in language learning, generalizing about the usage of new words from similar words that they already know how to use.&lt;ref name="Yarlett"&gt;{{cite web |last=Yarlett |first=Daniel G. |last2=Ramscar |first2=Michael J. A. |year=2008 |title=Language Learning Through Similarity-Based Generalization|accessdate=June 10, 2014 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.393.7298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Language acquisition]] researcher Michael Ramscar has suggested that when children erroneously expect an ungrammatical form that then never occurs, the repeated failure of expectation serves as a form of implicit [[negative feedback]] that allows them to correct their errors over time such as how children correct grammar generalizations like ''goed'' to ''went'' through repetitive failure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramscar"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ramscar |first=Michael |last2=Yarlett |first2=Daniel |year=2007 |title=Linguistic self-correction in the absence of feedback: A new approach to the logical problem of language acquisition |journal=Cognitive Science |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=927–960 |doi=10.1080/03640210701703576 |pmid=21635323}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that word learning is a probabilistic, error-driven process, rather than a process of [[fast mapping]], as many nativists assume.

In the domain of field research, the [[Pirahã language]] is claimed to be a counterexample to the basic tenets of universal grammar. This research has been led by [[Daniel Everett]]. Among other things, this language is alleged to lack all evidence for [[recursion]], including [[Dependent clause|embedded clauses]], as well as [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifiers]] and [[colour]] terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Everett |first=Daniel L. |title=Cultural Constraints on Grammar and Cognition in Pirahã: Another Look at the Design Features of Human Language |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=46 |issue=4 |date=August–October 2005 |pages=621–646 |url=http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~kay/Everett.CA.Piraha.pdf |doi=10.1086/431525}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the writings of Everett, the Pirahã showed these linguistic shortcomings not because they were simple-minded, but because their culture—which emphasized concrete matters in the present and also lacked creation myths and traditions of art making—did not necessitate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schuessler |first=Jennifer |title=How Do You Say 'Disagreement' in Pirahã? |work=The New York Times |date=March 22, 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/22/books/a-new-book-and-film-about-rare-amazonian-language.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |page=C1 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other linguists have argued, however, that some of these properties have been misanalyzed, and that others are actually expected under current theories of universal grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, et al., 2007 Pirahã Exceptionality: a Reassessment [http://stirling.kent.ac.uk/SE551/Week10/Nevins%20et%20al%202007%20Piraha%20Exceptionality.pdf]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521063250/http://stirling.kent.ac.uk/SE551/Week10/Nevins%20et%20al%202007%20Piraha%20Exceptionality.pdf |date=May 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other linguists have attempted to reassess Pirahã to see if it did indeed use recursion. In a corpus analysis of the Pirahã language, linguists failed to disprove Everett's arguments against universal grammar and the lack of recursion in Pirahã. However, they also stated that there was "no strong evidence for the lack of recursion either" and they provided "suggestive evidence that Pirahã may have sentences with recursive
structures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=August 2012 |first=Steven T. |last=Piantadosi |first2=Laura |last2=Stearns |first3=Daniel L. |last3=Everett |first4=Edward |last4=Gibson |title=A corpus analysis of Pirahã grammar: An investigation of recursion |url=http://tedlab.mit.edu/tedlab_website/researchpapers/Piantadosi_et_al_2012_LSAtalk_Piraha.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Everett has gone as far as claiming that universal grammar does not exist. In his words, "universal grammar doesn't seem to work, there doesn't seem to be much evidence for [it]. And what can we put in its place? A complex interplay of factors, of which culture, the values human beings share, plays a major role in structuring the way that we talk and the things that we talk about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McCrum |first=Robert |title=Daniel Everett: 'There is no such thing as universal grammar |work=The Observer |date=March 24, 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/25/daniel-everett-human-language-piraha |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Tomasello]], a developmental psychologist, also supports this claim, arguing that "although many aspects of human linguistic competence have indeed evolved biologically, specific grammatical principles and constructions have not. And universals in the grammatical structure of different languages have come from more general processes and constraints of human cognition, communication, and vocal-auditory processing, operating during the conventionalization and transmission of the particular grammatical constructions of particular linguistic communities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Michael Tomasello|Tomasello]] |first=Michael |year=2008 |title=Origins of human communication |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-51520-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''World Christian Encyclopedia''''' is a [[reference work]] published by [[Oxford University Press]], known for providing membership statistics for major and minor world [[religion]]s in every country of the world, including historical data and projections of future populations.

The first edition, by [[David B. Barrett]], was published in 1982. The second edition ({{ISBN|978-0195079630}}), by Barrett, [[George Thomas Kurian]], and [[Todd M. Johnson]], was published in 2001. The research team was originally based in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], and later relocated to [[Richmond, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garrison |first=David |date=Fall 2004 |title=Church Planting Movements: The Next Wave? |journal=International Journal of Frontier Missions |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=118 |url=http://www.ijfm.org/PDFs_IJFM/21_3_PDFs/118_Garrison.pdf |accessdate= 2007-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the name, the encyclopedia includes membership data for numerous non-Christian religions. However, the work has been described as serving as "an informational undergirding for [[Mission (Christian)|Christian missionary]] work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard N. |last=Ostling |authorlink=Richard Ostling |title=Researcher tabulates world's believers |work= |publisher=Associated Press |date=2001-05-19 |accessdate=2007-11-28 |url=http://www.adherents.com/misc/WCE.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The data incorporated into the ''World Christian Encyclopedia'' have been made available online at the [http://worldchristiandatabase.org/ World Christian Database] (WCD). One study found that the WCD's data was "highly correlated with other sources that offer cross-national religious composition estimates" but the database "consistently gives a higher estimate for percent Christian in comparison to other cross-national data sets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hsu |first=Becky |author2=Amy Reynolds |author3=Conrad Hackett |author4= James Gibbon  |year=2008 |title=Estimating the Religious Composition of All Nations: An Empirical Assessment of the World Christian Database |journal=[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]] |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=691–692 |url=http://www.conradhackett.com/uploads/2/6/7/2/2672974/evaluating_world_christian_database.pdf |accessdate=2012-01-27 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2008.00435.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
