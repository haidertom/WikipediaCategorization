The '''2013 New York divorce torture plot''' was a [[sting operation]] conducted by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] against a gang that had been kidnapping [[Jewish]] men and torturing them into granting their wives [[Get (divorce document)|gets]] (religious divorces). It began with the apprehension of Rabbi '''David Wax''',&lt;ref name="Guns Forced"&gt;Loder, Stephanie (May 15, 2014) [http://www.app.com/story/news/crime/jersey-mayhem/2014/05/15/orthodox-jewish-divorce/2149822/ "Stun Guns Forced Orthodox Divorce, Prosecutors Say"], ''Asbury Park Press''&lt;/ref&gt; and culminated in the arrest of a group of rabbis from [[New York (state)|New York]] under the direction of '''Mendel Epstein''', including '''Jay Goldstein''', '''Binyamin Stimler''', and '''Martin Wolmark''', who were involved in the planned kidnapping and torture of a fictitious Jewish husband in [[Middlesex County, New Jersey]], with the purpose of obtaining from him a ''get''. Epstein and his men were found guilty of attempted kidnapping in 2015, and were sentenced to prison, while Epstein's son, '''David Epstein''', was acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;Mullen, Shannon (April 21, 2015) [http://www.app.com/story/news/local/jackson-lakewood/lakewood/2015/04/21/lakewood-rabbi-kidnapping-trial/26125057/ "Rabbi Guilty of Kidnapping Conspiracy, Jury Finds"], ''Asbury Park Press''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{Main article|Jewish views on marriage#Divorce}}
A Jewish man is allowed to divorce his wife for virtually any reason by first receiving her permission, and then giving her a [[Get (divorce document)|get]]. If she is unwilling, and his complaint against her is substantial, he can pursue a [[heter meah rabbanim]] and remarry, although one is rarely awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/divorce.htm|title=Judaism 101: Divorce|website=www.jewfaq.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{rquote|right|You have to watch the man, what his habits are, where he goes, how and where you can grab him. If you have a plan, then you call the people who do the kidnapping... There is such a thing called a stun gun, and they put such a tape or something so that it shouldn't leave a mark on the surface. They administer electric shocks and it's not a dangerous thing that can damage or kill.|Epstein co-conspirator Jay Goldstein describing the gang's abduction and torture methods during a recorded phone call on December 28, 1996.&lt;ref name="Bad Rabbi"/&gt;}}
A Jewish woman seeking a divorce from her husband must present her complaint to a [[beth din]] with the implication of a serious physical blemish or character defect. The husband must be willing to divorce his wife, for if he gives the get unwillingly, the divorce is invalid, and any future offspring of the wife would be considered [[mamzer]]s. If the circumstances truly warrant a divorce and the husband is unwilling, the [[dayan (rabbinic judge)|dayan]] has the prerogative of instituting community shunning measures to "coerce him until he agrees," with physical force being reserved only for the rarest of cases.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowitz, Chaim; [http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/getart3.html "The New York State Get Bill and its Halachic Ramifications"]; ''Jewish Law Articles''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="times"&gt;Goldstein, Joseph; Schwirtz, Michael (October 11, 2013) [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/11/nyregion/rabbis-accused-in-kidnapping-plot-to-force-men-to-grant-divorces/ "Rabbis Said to Use Torture For Fee to Force Divorce"], ''The New York Times'' {{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="torture"&gt;Bandler, Jonathan; Lieberman, Steve (October 10, 2013) [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/10/rabbis-fbi-divorce-sting/2959369/ "FBI Arrests N.Y. Rabbis in Jewish Divorce-gang Probe], ''USA Today''&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in this grey area of [[halakha]] that in the mid-1980s a [[rabbi]] from [[Brooklyn]], New York, Mendel Epstein, began to advocate for women seeking religious divorces from their husbands.&lt;ref name="Wild"&gt;Dickter, Adam (October 16, 2013) [https://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/accused-kidnap-rabbi-known-for-wild-west-rules/ "Accused Kidnap Rabbi Known For ‘Wild West’ Rules"], ''The New York Jewish Week''&lt;/ref&gt; Dubbed '''The Prodfather''' by the press due to his boast of using a [[cattle prod]] against his victims, Epstein started a divorce-gang which coerced these men to give the ''get''s through the use of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Mullen, Shannon (December 15, 2015) [http://www.app.com/story/news/local/jackson-lakewood/lakewood/2015/12/15/lakewood-rabbi-epstein-divorce-gets/77351110/ "10-year Sentence for Lakewood 'Prodfather' Rabbi"], ''Asbury Park Press''&lt;/ref&gt; Although U.S. laws prohibit [[kidnapping]], [[assault]], and [[torture]], some rabbis have gone on record anonymously to sanction these otherwise "inhumane" acts against "angry husbands."&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Gedalyahu, Tzvi (October 10, 2013) [http://www.jewishpress.com/news/fbi-arrests-ny-rabbis-for-beating-husbands-refusing-divorce/2013/10/10/ "FBI Arrests NY Rabbis for Beating Husbands Who Refuse Divorce"], ''Jewish Press''&lt;/ref&gt; If a man got so scared from this treatment as to suffer a [[heart attack]], Epstein would instruct his gang to "Take a right turn and let him die."&lt;ref name="NYDN1"&gt;Blau, Reuven (April 22, 2015) [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/orthodox-rabbi-guilty-kidnapping-beating-jewish-husbands-article-1.2193597/ "N.J. Jury Finds Orthodox Rabbi Guilty of Kidnap-Divorce Plot], ''New York Daily News''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, [[fathers' rights movement|Father's Rights]] activist Monty Weinstein staged a protest with twenty-five people outside Epstein's home, with some carrying signs that read "Stop Mendel Epstein!"&lt;ref name="Bad Rabbi"/&gt;

== Victims ==
* '''Abraham Rubin''': On October 23, 1996 in [[Borough Park, Brooklyn]], Rubin was shoved into a van, beaten and [[Electroshock weapon|stun-gunned]] in his genitals until he agreed to give his wife a get. After his 3-hour ordeal, he was left bruised, bloodied, handcuffed and blindfolded at the entrance to a cemetery. Charges were dropped against his attackers by Brooklyn [[district attorney]] [[Charles Hynes]] in 2000, after Rubin "could not identify any of his assailants."&lt;ref name="Bad Rabbi"&gt;Samaha, Albert (December 4, 2013) [http://www.villagevoice.com/news/bad-rabbi-tales-of-extortion-and-torture-depict-a-divorce-brokers-brutal-grip-on-the-orthodox-community-6440276 "Bad Rabbi: Tales of Extortion and Torture Depict a Divorce Broker's Brutal Grip on the Orthodox Community"], ''The Village Voice''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;{{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;Saul, Josh; Italiano, Laura (October 11, 2013) [https://nypost.com/2013/10/11/orthodox-rabbis-beat-me-stun-gunned-my-genitals-suit/ "Rabbis beat me, stun-gunned my genitals"], ''New York Post''&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Stephen Weiss''': An accountant, Weiss came forward in 1998, alleging that his jaw, leg, and arm were broken in 1992 by members of a ring run by Epstein and Martin Wolmark, but no arrests were made. ''[[Newsday]]'' interviewed an additional dozen residents of Borough Park and [[Midwood, Brooklyn]], all of whom claimed that they were harassed, threatened, or assaulted by men working for their estranged wives. Hynes agreed to look into the charges but, despite pressure from the victims, declined to prosecute.&lt;ref name="Orthodox Hit"&gt;Shaer, Matthew (September 2, 2014) [https://www.gq.com/story/epstein-orthodox-hit-squad "Epstein Orthodox Hit Squad"], ''GQ''&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Israel Markowitz''': On December 1, 2009, Markowitz was lured from Brooklyn to [[Lakewood Township, New Jersey]] under the pretense of receiving employment at a [[Paper shredder|document shredding]] establishment.&lt;ref name="Guns Forced"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Officially Ties"&gt;Samaha, Albert (May 23, 2014) [http://www.villagevoice.com/news/indictment-officially-ties-rabbis-to-three-divorce-extortion-kidnappings-6675293 "Indictment Officially Ties Rabbis to Three Divorce Extortion Kidnappings"], ''The Village Voice''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gecan, Alex N.

* '''Yisrael Bryskman''': On October 16, 2010, Bryskman, an [[Israel]]i citizen, was lured from New York to the Lakewood home of David Wax, an accomplice of Epstein, where he was promised employment as a typist of [[Talmud]]ic texts.&lt;ref name="Officially Ties"/&gt; Bryskman entered Wax's home shortly before midnight, was shown into a second-story bedroom, and was immediately punched in the face, breaking his nose. He was then forced to the floor, blindfolded, handcuffed, and ankle-tied.&lt;ref name="December 15"/&gt; A pool of blood appeared on the carpet, ruining it. Wax, who wore a [[cowboy hat]] during the attack, presented Bryskman with a [[body bag]], "to get [you] used to the size."&lt;ref name="Violent Scheme"&gt;Hutchinson, Bill (May 6, 2014) [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/n-rabbi-pleads-guilty-violent-scheme-force-jewish-divorce-article-1.1781952 "N.J. Rabbi Pleads Guilty to Violent Scheme to Force a Jewish Divorce"], ''New York Daily News''&lt;/ref&gt; He was then kicked in the ribs, burned with acid, and threatened to be urinated upon, [[rat torture|fed to rats]], and buried alive, until he agreed to give his wife a get.&lt;ref name="Orthodox Hit"/&gt; Wax was paid $100,000 from the wife's family for the document, half of which went to Epstein, and he attempted to extort an additional $50,000&lt;ref name="Guns Forced"/&gt; from Bryskman's father in Israel over the phone, threatening that if he didn't comply, he'd receive a "special gift - it's called a bullet...in your head."&lt;ref name="Bad Rabbi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Orthodox Hit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Violent Scheme"/&gt;
* '''Usher Chaimowitz''' and '''Menachem Teitelbaum''': On August 22, 2011, in Brooklyn, Chaimowitz and his roommate Teitelbaum were assaulted, tied up, and beaten for two hours until Chaimowitz agreed to give his wife a get. Teitelbaum was punched in the face, had four of his teeth knocked out, his head pushed through a wall, and his mouth stuffed with dirty socks when he tried to scream for help. When he asked why they were beating him, seeing that Chaimowitz was the one they were after, one of his attackers quoted the Talmudic dictum, "Woe to the evildoer, woe to his neighbor."&lt;ref name="December 15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Men Hold"&gt;Jones, Abigail (April 8, 2015) [http://www.newsweek.com/2015/04/17/fighting-be-free-lengths-orthodox-jewish-women-will-go-get-320536.html "In Orthodox Jewish Divorce, Men Hold All the Cards"], ''Newsweek''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spoto, MaryAnn (March 2, 2015) [http://www.nj.com/ocean/index.ssf/2015/03/brooklyn_man_testifies_he_was_victim_in_lakewood_r.html "'Give A Divorce,' Attackers Yelled As They Beat Men, Victim Testifies In Lakewood Rabbi Trial"], ''NJ.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wax implicates Epstein ==
In October 2010, David Wax and his wife Judy were arrested for their part in the Bryskman kidnapping, and Wax subsequently agreed to testify as a government witness, claiming Epstein was the head of the operation and that his son David was present in the bedroom during the Bryskman beating.&lt;ref name="Trial Underway"&gt;Spoto, MaryAnn (February 18, 2015) [http://www.nj.com/ocean/index.ssf/2015/02/lakewood_rabbi_and_three_others.html"Lakewood Rabbi Trial Underway for Kidnap, Torture of Husbands"], ''NJ.com''&lt;/ref&gt; Their relationship dated back to the 1980s, when Epstein had forced a divorce for Wax's sister. The Bryskman case was what led federal authorities in New Jersey to begin their investigation of Mendel Epstein for his role in the crime.&lt;ref name="David Wax"&gt;Samaha, Albert (May 7, 2014) [https://www.villagevoice.com/2014/05/07/david-wax-pleads-guilty-implicates-mendel-epstein-in-nj-divorce-extortion-case/ "David Wax Pleads Guilty, Implicates Mendel Epstein in NJ Divorce Extortion Case"], ''The Village Voice''&lt;/ref&gt;

== FBI sting operation ==
In the summer of 2013, a woman dialed Martin Wolmark, an accomplice of Epstein, and told him a story about a husband who refused to give her a get.&lt;ref name="Bad Rabbi"/&gt; Wolmark said:

{{quote | You need special rabbis who are going to take this thing and see it through to the end...getting a guy like Mendel Epstein who's a hired hand...You need to get him to New York where someone either could harass him or nail him, plain and simple.&lt;ref name="For Role"&gt;(December 14, 2015) [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/15/nyregion/rabbi-sentenced-for-role-in-divorce-coercion-ring.html "Rabbi Sentenced for Role in Divorce-Coercion Ring"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Reuven (February 19, 2015) [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/rabbi-forced-divorce-plot-spoke-hired-hand-call-article-1.2122195 "Rabbi Accused in Forced Divorce Plot is Called 'Hired Hand' who would 'Harass or Nail' Husband in Phone Recording"], ''New York Daily News''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On August 14, 2013, she visited Epstein in Lakewood with another man she said was her brother. Epstein said to the two visitors:

{{quote | This is an expensive thing to do. Basically what we are going to be doing is kidnapping a guy for a couple of hours and beating him up and torturing him and then getting him to give the get.&lt;ref name="Bad Rabbi"/&gt;}}

The man then asked about Epstein's effectiveness, to which he replied:

{{quote | Wait a minute here. I guarantee you that if you're in the van, you'd give a get to your wife. You probably love your wife, but you'd give a get when they finish with you. Hopefully, there won't even be a mark on him. We prefer not to leave a mark. Because then when you do, they do go to the police, the police look at the guy. . . and basically the reaction of the police is, if the guy does not have a mark on him, then, 'Is there some Jewish crazy affair here?' They don't get involved.&lt;ref name="Bad Rabbi"/&gt;}}

Epstein explained he would need $10,000 to approve the coercion at the [[beth din]], and $60,000 for the "tough guys", who would use [[karate]],&lt;ref name="Wild"/&gt; rope, a screwdriver, and plastic bags over the men's heads to get them to cooperate.&lt;ref name="Officially Ties"/&gt; And if all else fails, then:

{{quote | We take an electric cattle prod. If it can get a bull that weighs five tons to move, you put it in certain parts of the body and in one minute the guy will know.&lt;ref name="Bad Rabbi"/&gt;}}

Epstein also told the woman that he would not be present at the attack, planning instead to be out and about, and suggested that she do the same, explaining that being seen in public would provide them with an alibi.&lt;ref name="torture"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Barbara (January 25, 2017) [http://www.philly.com/philly/news/new_jersey/Rabbis-in-strong-arm-divorces-challenge-convictions.html"Rabbis in Strong-arm Religious Divorces Ask Court to Overturn Convictions"], ''Philly.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

The man and woman turned out to be undercover FBI agents.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;{{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;ref name="Men Hold"/&gt;

== Arrests ==
On October 9, 2013, 8 men wearing [[Halloween mask]]s, [[ski masks]], and [[bandanas]] &amp;ndash; one wore a [[Metallica]] [[ T-shirt]] on top of his clothes &amp;ndash; came to a warehouse in [[Middlesex County, New Jersey]], where they [[Muscle contraction|flexed]] and [[Shadowboxing|shadow-boxed]] as they waited for their prey, the 'recalcitrant husband' who did not exist.&lt;ref name="Trial Underway"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New Details"&gt;Lieberman, Steve and Bandler, Jonathan (October 11, 2013).

Epstein was arrested separately in Brooklyn.&lt;ref name="twelve"&gt;(October 11, 2013) [http://westchester.news12.com/news/prominent-rabbi-mendel-epstein-arrested-in-divorce-extortion-case/ "Two Prominent Orthodox Jewish Rabbis Arrested in Divorce Extortion Case"]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''News12 Westchester''&lt;/ref&gt;

During a federal court hearing the following day in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Gribko told a judge, "They didn't do it out of religious conviction. They did it for money."&lt;ref name="Divorce:Feds"/&gt;

On May 6, 2014, Wax pleaded guilty in federal court in New Jersey to conspiracy to commit kidnapping. He named the men arrested the previous October as his accomplices.&lt;ref name="David Wax"/&gt;

== Criminal trials ==
The trial of the main defendants commenced on February 18, 2015 at the [[United States District Court for the District of New Jersey]] in Trenton.&lt;ref name="Trial Underway"/&gt; On April 21, they appeared before District Judge [[Freda L. Wolfson]], whereupon Mendel Epstein was convicted of conspiracy to commit kidnapping, while accomplices Jay Goldstein and Binyamin Stimler were additionally convicted of attempted kidnapping. David Epstein was acquitted, in part by defence attorney Henry Mazurek's contention that David was in a business meeting in [[Cincinnati]] during Usher Chaimowitz's beating.&lt;ref name="Trial Underway"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spoto, MaryAnn (March 26, 2015) [http://www.nj.com/ocean/index.ssf/2015/03/lakewood_rabbis_son_wasnt_involved_in_forced_divor.html "Lakewood Rabbi's Son Wasn't Involved in Forced Divorce, Executive Testifies"], ''NJ.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 14, Martin Wolmark, who had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit extortion, was sentenced to more than 3 years in prison.&lt;ref name="For Role"/&gt; The next day, at his own sentencing, Mendel Epstein told the judge: 

{{quote | Over the years, I guess, I got caught up in my tough guy image. Truthfully, it helped me &amp;ndash; the reputation &amp;ndash; convince many of these reprobates to do the right thing."&lt;ref name="Rabbi Sentenced"&gt;Spoto, MaryAnn (December 15, 2015) [http://www.nj.com/ocean/index.ssf/2015/12/lakewood_rabbi_sentenced_to_10_years_in_prison_for.html"Lakewood Rabbi Sentenced to 10 years in Prison for Divorce Kidnappings"], ''NJ.com''&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

Epstein and Stimler were sentenced to 10 years and 3 years respectively. Wolfson said during the proceeding that "No one is permitted to commit acts of violence against another," and that the sentence was necessary in order to deter others in the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] community from engaging in similar paid vigilantism.&lt;ref name="Rabbi Sentenced"/&gt;

One day later, Goldstein was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment. Six other co-defendants also pleaded guilty before trial, and were sentenced to up to 4 years.&lt;ref name="NYDN1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="December 15"&gt;{{cite web|author1=U.S. Attorney’s Office District of New Jersey|title=Two Orthodox Jewish Rabbis Sentenced To Prison For Conspiring To Kidnap Jewish Husbands, Force Them To Consent To Religious Divorces|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/two-orthodox-jewish-rabbis-sentenced-prison-conspiring-kidnap-jewish-husbands-force-them|date=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Apr 21, 2015) [https://www.fbi.gov/newark/press-releases/2015/three-orthodox-jewish-rabbis-convicted-of-conpsiracy-to-kidnap-jewish-husbands-in-order-to-force-them-to-consent-to-religious-divorces/ "Three Orthodox Jewish Rabbis Convicted of Conspiracy to Kidnap Jewish Husbands in Order to Force Them to Consent to Religious Divorces"], ''U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=U.S. Attorney’s Office District of New Jersey|title=Orthodox Jewish Rabbi Sentenced To Eight Years In Prison For Conspiring To Kidnap Jewish Husbands, Force Them To Consent To Religious Divorces|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/orthodox-jewish-rabbi-sentenced-eight-years-prison-conspiring-kidnap-jewish-husbands|date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
Rabbinical judge David Eidensohn of Monsey, New York said, "I'm shocked that people who call themselves rabbis would get involved in coercion." According to Eidensohn, if a woman obtains a get in such a manner and remarries, "her marriage is not legal and she would be considered living in sin. If she has children, the children are considered born out of wedlock, and that's considered a disgrace in the community."&lt;ref name="New Details"/&gt;

[[Samuel Heilman]], professor of sociology and Jewish studies at [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]] said, "Using force, that's the way it used to be done centuries ago. Most Jews don't operate like that anymore, but in this community... it's a sort of fundamentalist view."&lt;ref&gt;Nicosia, Mareesa (October 13, 2013). [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/13/rabbis-fbi-divorce-sting/2976271/ "Orthodox Leaders Struggle with Divorce Gang History"], ''USA Today''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moshe David Tendler]], rabbi and professor of medical ethics at [[Yeshiva University]] said, "The idea that a beth din can issue an order for coercion is baloney, a hoax." While conceding that he had "been with [Epstein] on matters," Tendler nevertheless considered him "unreliable."&lt;ref name="New Details"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5978">'''A.G. Syjuco''' (born Augusto Cesare Amado R. Syjuco in August 1980) is a music producer, composer, and musician originally from [[Manila]], [[Philippines]]. He is the eldest son of [[avant-garde]] artists [[Cesare Syjuco]] and [[Jean Marie Syjuco]] and is the producer, principal composer, and primary instrumentalist  of the experimental rock band Jack of None.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jackofnone.net/|title=Jack of None|website=Jackofnone.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the lead guitarist and composer for the art-rock band FAUST! at age 15. The band was discovered by MTV Asia in 1996 and quickly signed to a major label. FAUST! released two albums that included ''My Secret Identity'' (MSI) in 1998 — which was arguably the first full-length album in the Philippines to be released for free on the Internet by a group of commercially signed recording artists - and disbanded shortly after.  A.G. took a hiatus from the music industry for eight years, and during this period he graduated valedictorian (Summa Cum Laude) with a bachelor's degree in Information Technology from San Beda College Alabang.  &lt;ref name="philstar.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2011/01/05/645051/cruz-syjuco-achievers-ingrid-rey-resume-journey|title=Cruz, Syjuco: Achievers /Ingrid, Rey resume journey|website=Philstar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chuvaness.com/tag/philippine-star/|title=philippine star - Chuvaness.com|website=Chuvaness.com|accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pinoyalbums.com/45011/faust-toons-from-an-alien-broadcast/|title=Faust – Toons From An Alien Broadcast|website=Pinoyalbums.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.flyahmagazine.com/2016/06/jack-of-none-cool-and-unique.html|title=Jack of None cool and unique|website=Flyah Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, A.G. co-produced the album "A Sudden Rush of Genius", by his father, Cesare Syjuco.&lt;ref name="philstar.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mbmalay.blogspot.com/2012/11/a-sudden-rush-of-cesare-march-28-2011.html|title=Malay Uncut: A SUDDEN RUSH OF CESARÉ (March 28, 2011)|first=Malay|last=Uncut|website=Malay Uncut}}&lt;/ref&gt;From 2005-2010 A.G. was the lead guitarist and composer of the band “Utakan” which he formed with his wife Mica and sister [[Maxine Syjuco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.artslant.com/ny/articles/show/31083-the-herons-secret-maxine-syjuco-as-a-performance-artist|title=The Heron's Secret: Maxine Syjuco as a Performance Artist - ArtSlant|website=ArtSlant}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the band re-formed as Jack of None with A.G., Maxine and their brother Julian as the third member.

{{About|the tournament system used in the Australian Football League since 2000|the Australian Football League finals series itself|AFL finals series}}
The '''AFL final eight system''' is an eight-team championship [[playoff]] [[tournament]] developed and adopted by the [[Australian Football League]] in the 2000 season. The eight teams, which are ranked or seeded in advance of the tournament, participate in a four-week tournament, with two teams eliminated in each of the first three weeks. The [[grand final]] is played in the fourth week between the two remaining teams, with the winning team awarded the premiership.

The system is designed to give the top four teams an easier road to the Grand Final than the second four teams. The top four teams need to win only two finals to reach the Grand Final, while the second four teams need to win three. The two winning teams of the top four receive a [[bye (sports)|bye]] in the second week of the playoff and then play at home in the third week, and the two losing teams play at home in the second week.

The AFL introduced the system in 2000 to address several perceived issues with the [[McIntyre Final Eight System]] that had been in use in that competition from 1994–1999. The system has also been adopted by the [[Victorian Football League]] and the [[National Rugby League]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrl.com/nrls-mcintyre-finals-system-scrapped/tabid/10874/newsid/65961/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Similar systems are used by [[Super League]], and were previously used by the [[Australian Rugby League]] in the 1995 and 1996 seasons.

==Finals format==
===Week one===
* 1st Qualifying Final: 1st ranked team hosts 4th ranked team
* 2nd Qualifying Final: 2nd ranked team hosts 3rd ranked team
* 1st Elimination Final: 5th ranked team hosts 8th ranked team
* 2nd Elimination Final: 6th ranked team hosts 7th ranked team

The eight finalists are split into two groups for the opening week of the Finals Series.  The top four teams have the best chance of winning the premiership and play the two Qualifying Finals.  The winners get a bye through to Week Three of the tournament to play home Preliminary Finals, while the losers play home Semi-Finals in Week Two.  The bottom four teams play the two Elimination Finals, where the winners advance to Week Two away games and the losers' seasons are over.

===Week two===
* 1st Semi-final:&lt;ref name="semi-final"&gt;Under the AFL finals series, the term "semi-final" has different usage to that a traditional [[knock out tournament]]. The two games played immediately before the Grand Final, which would be known as semi-finals in a knock out tournament, are called "preliminary finals". The semi-finals refer to the two games preceding the preliminary finals. This unusual terminology is a consequence of retaining aspects of the terminology used under the [[McIntyre System]]s from 1931 until 1993, when only one preliminary final was played.&lt;/ref&gt; Loser of 1st QF hosts winner of 1st EF
* 2nd Semi-final: Loser of 2nd QF hosts winner of 2nd EF

===Week three===
* 1st Preliminary Final:&lt;ref name="semi-final" /&gt; Winner of 1st QF hosts winner of 2nd SF
* 2nd Preliminary Final: Winner of 2nd QF hosts winner of 1st SF

===Week four===
* Grand Final: Winner of 1st PF meets Winner of 2nd PF.

==Advantages for ladder positions==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
Under this finals system, the final eight teams are broken up into two halves of four teams which are in turn split into two pairs each. The higher a team's position on the ladder, the greater benefits they receive. The top half of the ladder has two key advantages. These teams only need to win twice to reach the Grand Final (either a Qualifying or Semi-Final and a Preliminary Final), and they have the benefit of the '''double-chance'''; since the Qualifying Final is non-elimination, losers still have a second chance to reach the Grand Final by winning their two other Finals. Teams in the top six get the benefit of at least one home final; the top two teams play two home finals.

A team's final rank in the home-and-away season also determines their pairings for the first week. In the Qualifying Finals, 1st place plays 4th place and 2nd place plays 3rd place; in the Elimination Finals, 5th place plays 8th place and 6th place plays 7th place. The better a team's rank, the more advantageous (or less disadvantageous) the matchup. After the first week, matchups are determined directly by the results of the previous week.

===First and second===
The top two seeds '''host''' their ''first two'' finals: the Qualifying Final and whatever final they play next (Preliminary Final if they win, Semi-Final if they lose). They also have the benefit of only needing to win twice to reach the Grand Final. If they win the Qualifying Final, they earn the bye to the Preliminary Final; otherwise they get the '''double-chance''' and can still reach the Preliminary Final by winning the Semifinal.

===Third and fourth===
The next two seeds '''visit''' for the Qualifying Final but then '''host''' their next final. Like the top two, these teams only need to win twice to reach the Grand Final. Winning the Qualifying Final earns them the bye to the Preliminary Final; losing gives them the '''double-chance''' via the Semi-Final.

===Fifth and sixth===
Fifth and sixth place '''host''' their Elimination Final and '''visit''' any other finals they reach. These teams must win ''all three'' of their finals (Elimination, Semi-, and Preliminary Finals) to avoid elimination.

===Seventh and eighth===
The last two teams '''visit''' throughout the finals and also must win ''all three'' of their finals to avoid elimination.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="52299">{{Distinguish|Information access}}
'''Access to information''' is the ability for an individual to seek, receive and impart information effectively. This sometimes includes "scientific, [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]], and traditional knowledge; freedom of information, building of open knowledge resources, including open Internet and open standards, and open access and availability of data; preservation of digital heritage; respect for cultural and linguistic diversity, such as fostering access to local content in accessible languages; quality education for all, including lifelong and [[Educational technology|e-learning]]; diffusion of new media and information [[literacy]] and skills, and social inclusion online, including addressing inequalities based on skills, education, gender, age, race, ethnicity, and accessibility by those with disabilities; and the development of connectivity and affordable ICTs, including mobile, the Internet, and broadband infrastructures".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Michael Buckland defines six types of barriers that have to be overcome in order for access to information to be achieved: identification of the source, availability of the source, price of the user, cost to the provider, cognitive access, acceptability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/access.html|title=Access to information.|website=people.ischool.berkeley.edu|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; While “access to information”, “right to information”, “[[right to know]]” and “freedom of information” are sometimes used as synonyms, the diverse terminology does highlight particular (albeit related) dimensions of the issue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Overview ==
There has been a signiﬁcant increase in access to the [[Internet]], which reached just over three billion users in 2014, amounting to about 42 per cent of the world’s population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; But the [[digital divide]] continues to exclude over half of the world’s population, particularly women and girls, and especially in Africa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/ﬁleadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/ofﬁcial_documents/Eng%20-%20Recommendation%20concerning%20the%20Promotion%20and%20Use%20of%20Multilingualism%20and%20Universal%20Access%20to%20Cyberspace.pdf|title=Recommendation s concerning the promotion and use of multilinguisme and universal access to cyberspace|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Least Developed Countries|least developed countries]] as well as several [[Small Island Developing States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001878/187832e.pdf|title=Towards Inclusive Knowledge Societies: A Review of UNESCO Action in Implementing the WSIS Outcomes.|last=Souter|first=David|date=2010|website=unesdoc.unesco.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, individuals with disabilities can either be advantaged or further disadvantaged by the design of technologies or through the presence or absence of [[Information and media literacy|training and education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002272/227229e.pdf|title=Photos|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context ==
=== The Digital Divide ===
{{Main|Digital divide}}
Access to information faces great difficulties because of the global digital divide. A digital divide is an [[Economic inequality|economic]] and [[social inequality]] with regard to access to, use of, or impact of [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICT).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fallingthru.html|title=FALLING THROUGH THE NET:   A Survey of the "Have Nots" in Rural and Urban America {{!}} National Telecommunications and Information Administration|website=www.ntia.doc.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The divide within countries (such as the [[digital divide in the United States]]) may refer to inequalities between individuals, households, businesses, or geographic areas, usually at different [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] levels or other demographic categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wfNPdyiwbYQC&amp;lpg=PA148&amp;dq=9780521002233&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Digital Divide: Civic Engagement, Information Poverty, and the Internet Worldwide|last=Norris|first=Pippa|last2=Norris|first2=McGuire Lecturer in Comparative Politics Pippa|date=2001-09-24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00223-3|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The divide between differing countries or regions of the world is referred to as the [[global digital divide]], examining this technological gap between developing and developed countries on an international scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-L8frgEACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Robert+W.+Fairlie%22|title=The Determinants of the Global Digital Divide: A Cross-country Analysis of Computer and Internet Penetration|last=Lee|first=Jaewoo|last2=Andreoni|first2=James|last3=Bagwell|first3=Kyle|last4=Cripps|first4=Martin W.|last5=Chinn|first5=Menzie David|last6=Durlauf|first6=Steven N.|last7=Brock|first7=William A.|last8=Che|first8=Yeon-Koo|last9=Cohen-Cole|first9=Ethan|date=2004|publisher=Social Systems Research Institute, University of Wisconsin|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender Divide ===
Women's [[freedom of information]] and access to information is far from being equal to men's. It's the access to information gender divide. Social barriers such as [[Literacy|illiteracy]] and lack of digital empowerment have created stark inequalities in navigating the tools used for access to information, often exacerbating lack of awareness of issues that directly relate to women and gender, such as [[Reproductive health|sexual health]]. There have also been examples of more extreme measures, such as local community authorities banning or restricting [[mobile phone]] use for girls and unmarried women in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genderingsurveillance.internetdemocracy.in/phone_ban/|title=‘Chupke, Chupke’: Going Behind the Mobile Phone Bans in North India|website=genderingsurveillance.internetdemocracy.in|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of States, including some that have introduced new laws since 2010, notably censor voices from and content related to the [[LGBT]]QI community, posing serious consequences to access to information about [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/statefree-expression-online-southeast-asia|title=Deeplinks Blog|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital platforms play a powerful role in limiting access to certain content, such as [[YouTube]]’s 2017 decision to classify non-explicit videos with LGBTQ themes as ‘restricted’, a classification designed to filter out ‘potentially inappropriate content’.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Elle. 2017.

=== The security argument ===
With the evolution of the [[digital age]], application of [[freedom of speech]] and its corollaries (freedom of information, access to information) becomes more controversial as new means of communication and restrictions arise including government control or commercial methods putting personal information to danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human rights and encryption|last=Wolfgang|first=Schultz|last2=van Hoboken|first2=Joris|publisher=UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100185-7|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002465/246527e.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Digital Access ==

=== Media and Information Literacy ===
According to Kuzmin and Parshakova, access to information entails learning in formal and informal education settings. It also entails fostering the competencies of [[Information and media literacy|Media and Information Literacy]] (MIL) that enable users to be empowered and make full use of access to the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Kuzmin, E., and Parshakova, A. (2013), Media and Information Literacy for Knowledge Societies. Translated by Butkova, T., Kuptsov, Y., and Parshakova, A. Moscow: Interregional Library Cooperation Centre for UNESCO. http://www.ifapcom.ru/ﬁles/News/Images/2013/mil_eng_web.pdf#page=24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2013a), UNESCO Communication and Information Sector with UNESCO Institute for Statistics, Global Media and Information Literacy Assessment Framework: Country Readiness and Competencies. Paris: UNESCO. Available online at http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002246/224655e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNESCO's support for [[journalism education]] is an example of how UNESCO seeks to contribute to the provision of independent and veriﬁable information accessible in [[cyberspace]]. Promoting access for disabled persons has been strengthened by the UNESCO-convened conference in 2014, which adopted the “New Delhi Declaration on Inclusive ICTs for Persons with Disabilities: Making Empowerment a Reality”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Open Standards ===
According to the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU), ""Open Standards" are standards made available to the general public and developed (or approved) and maintained via a collaborative and consensus driven process. "Open Standards" facilitate [[interoperability]] and data exchange among different products or services and are intended for widespread adoption." A UNESCO study considers that adopting open standards has the potential to contribute to the vision of a ‘digital commons’ in which citizens can freely ﬁnd, share, and re-use information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Promoting open source software, which is both free of cost and freely modiﬁable could help meet the particular needs of marginalized users advocacy on behalf of minority groups, such as targeted outreach, better provision of Internet access, tax incentives for private companies and organizations working to enhance access, and solving underlying issues of social and economic inequalities&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Privacy protections ==

=== Privacy, surveillance and encryption ===
The increasing access to and reliance on [[digital media]] to receive and produce information have increased the possibilities for States and private sector companies to track individuals’ behaviors, opinions and networks. States have increasingly adopted laws and policies to legalize monitoring of communication, justifying these practices with the need to defend their own citizens and national interests. In parts of Europe, new [[Anti-terrorism legislation|anti-terrorism laws]] have enabled a greater degree of [[Surveillance|government surveillance]] and an increase in the ability of intelligence authorities to access citizens’ data. While legality is a precondition for legitimate limitations of human rights, the issue is also whether a given law is aligned to other criteria for justification such as necessity, proportionality and legitimate purpose.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== International framework ====
The [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] has taken a number of steps to highlight the importance of the universal right to privacy online. In 2015, in a resolution on the right to privacy in the digital age, it established a United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Privacy.&lt;ref&gt;UN Human Rights Council. 2016. The promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet. A/HRC/32/13. Available at http://www.un.org/en/ga/71/meetings/. Accessed 23 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the Human Rights Council emphasized that the ‘unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/ or interception of communications, as well as the unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data, as highly intrusive acts, violate the right to privacy, can interfere with other human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference’.&lt;ref&gt;UN Human Rights Council. 2017. The right to privacy in the digital age. A/HRC/34/L.7/ Rev.1. Available at http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/HRC/34/L.7/Rev.1. Accessed 24 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Regional framework ====
Number of regional efforts, particularly through the courts, to establish regulations that deal with data protection, privacy and surveillance, and which affect their relationship to journalistic uses. The [[Council of Europe]]’s Convention 108, the [[Convention for the protection of individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data|Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data]], has undergone a modernization process to address new challenges to privacy. Since 2012, four new countries belonging to the Council of Europe have signed or ratified the Convention, as well as three countries that do not belong to the Council, from [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe. 2017. Chart of signatures and ratifications of Treaty 108. Council of Europe Treaty Office. Available at http://www.coe.int/web/conventions/full-list. Accessed 7 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional courts are also playing a noteworthy role in the development of online privacy regulations. In 2015 the European Court of Justice found that the so-called ‘Safe Harbour Agreement’, which allowed private companies to ‘legally transmit personal data from their European subscribers to the US’,&lt;ref&gt;European Commission. n.d. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. Justice. Available at https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en&lt;/ref&gt;  was not valid under [[European Union law|European law]] in that it did not offer sufficient protections for the data of European citizens or protect them from arbitrary surveillance. In 2016, the [[European Commission]] and [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]] reached an agreement to replace Safe Harbour, the [[EU–US Privacy Shield|EU-U.S. Privacy Shield]], which includes data protection obligations on companies receiving personal data from the European Union, safeguards on United States government access to data, protection and redress for individuals, and an annual joint review to monitor implementation.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission. n.d. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. Justice. Available at https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Court of Justice]]’s 2014 decision in the Google Spain case allowed people to claim a ‘[[right to be forgotten]]’ or ‘right to be de-listed’ in a much-debated approach to the balance between privacy, free expression and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;Cannataci, Joseph A., Bo Zhao, Gemma Torres Vives, Shara Monteleone, Jeanne Mifsud Bonnici, and Evgeni Moyakine. 2016. Privacy, free expression and transparency: Redefining their new boundaries in the digital age. Paris: UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Google Spain decision the ‘right to be forgotten’ or ‘right to be de-listed’ has been recognized in a number of countries across the world, particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;Keller, Daphne. 2017.

Available at http://www.privacyregulation.eu/en/r153.htm. Accessed 7 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; states "Member States law should reconcile the rules governing freedom of expression and information, including journalistic…with the right to the protection of personal data pursuant to this Regulation. The processing of personal data solely for journalistic purposes…should be subject to derogations or exemptions from certain provisions of this Regulation if necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the right to freedom of expression and information, as enshrined in Article 11 of the Charter."&lt;ref&gt;Schulz, Wolfgang, and Joris van Hoboken. 2016a.

==== National framework ====
The number of countries around the world with data protection laws has also continued to grow. According to the World Trends Report 2017/2018, between 2012 and 2016, 20 UNESCO Member States adopted data protection laws for first time, bringing the global total to 101.&lt;ref&gt;Greenleaf, Graham. 2017. Global Tables of Data Privacy Laws and Bills (5th ed.). Privacy Laws &amp; Business International Report.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these new adoptions, nine were in Africa, four in Asia and the Pacific, three in Latin America and the Caribbean, two in the Arab region and one in Western Europe and North America. During the same period, 23 countries revised their data protection laws, reflecting the new challenges to data protection in the digital era.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to Global Partners Digital, only four States have secured in national legislation a general right to encryption, and 31 have enacted national legislation that grants law enforcement agencies the power [[Human rights and encryption|to intercept or decrypt encrypted communications]].&lt;ref&gt;Global Partners Digital. n.d.

=== Protection of confidential sources and whistle-blowing ===
Rapid changes in the [[digital environment]], coupled with contemporary journalist practice that increasingly relies on digital communication technologies, pose new risks for the protection of journalism sources. Leading contemporary threats include [[mass surveillance]] technologies, mandatory data retention policies, and disclosure of personal digital activities by third party intermediaries. Without a thorough understanding of how to shield their digital communications and traces, journalists and sources can unwittingly reveal identifying information.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Open Society Justice Initiative. 2013. The Global Principles on National Security and the Right to Information (Tshwane Principles). New York: Open Society Foundations.&lt;/ref&gt; Employment of national security legislation, such as [[counter-terrorism laws]], to override existing legal protections for source protection is also becoming a common practice.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In many regions, persistent secrecy laws or new cybersecurity laws threaten the protection of sources, such as when they give governments the right to intercept online communications in the interest of overly broad definitions of national security.&lt;ref&gt;Posetti, Julie. 2017a. Protecting Journalism Sources in the Digital Age. UNESCO Series on Internet Freedom. Paris, France: UNESCO Publishing. Available at http://www.unesco.org/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/protecting_journalism_sources_in_digital_age.pdf. Accessed 24 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Developments in regards to source protection laws have occurred between 2007 and mid-2015 in 84 (69 per cent) of the 121 countries surveyed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Posetti, Julie. 2017b.

== Media Pluralism ==
According to the [[World Trends Report]], access to a variety of media increased between 2012 and 2016. The internet has registered the highest growth in users supported by massive investments in infrastructure and significant uptake in mobile usage.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=261065&amp;set=005B054385_2_76&amp;gp=1&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=1|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internet mobile ===
The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the work of the [[Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development]], co-chaired by UNESCO, and the [[Internet Governance Forum]]’s intersessional work on ‘Connecting the Next Billion' are proof of the international commitments towards providing Internet access for all. According to the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU), by the end of 2017, an estimated 48 per cent of individuals regularly connect to the internet, up from 34 per cent in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;International Telecommunication Union (ITU). 2017a. Key ICT indicators for developed and developing countries and the world (totals and penetration rates). World Telecommunication/ICT Indicators database. Available at https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/publications/wtid.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the significant increase in absolute numbers, however, in the same period the annual growth rate of internet users has slowed down, with five per cent annual growth in 2017, dropping from a 10 per cent growth rate in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;International Telecommunication Union (ITU). 2017b. Status of the transition to Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting: Figures. ITU Telecommunication Development Sector. Available at http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Spectrum-Broadcasting/Pages/DSO/figures.aspx .&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of unique mobile cellular subscriptions increased from 3.89 billion in 2012 to 4.83 billion in 2016, two-thirds of the world’s population, with more than half of subscriptions located in Asia and the Pacific. The number of subscriptions is predicted to rise to 5.69 billion users in 2020.  As of 2016, almost 60 per cent of the world’s population had access to a 4G broadband cellular network, up from almost 50 per cent in 2015 and 11 per cent in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;GSMA. 2017. The Mobile Economy 2017. Available at https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/.&lt;/ref&gt;

The limits that users face on accessing information via mobile applications coincide with a broader process of fragmentation of the internet. [[Zero-rating]], the practice of internet providers allowing users free connectivity to access specific content or applications for free, has offered some opportunities for individuals to surmount economic hurdles, but has also been accused by its critics as creating a ‘two-tiered’ internet. To address the issues with zero-rating, an alternative model has emerged in the concept of ‘equal rating’ and is being tested in experiments by [[Mozilla]] and [[Orange S.A.|Orange]] in Africa. Equal rating prevents prioritization of one type of content and zero-rates all content up to a specified data cap. Some countries in the region had a handful of plans to choose from (across all mobile network operators) while others, such as [[Colombia]], offered as many as 30 pre-paid and 34 post-paid plans.&lt;ref&gt;Galpaya, Helani. 2017.

=== Broadcast media ===
In Western Europe and North America, the primacy of [[television]] as a main source of information is being challenged by the internet, while in other regions, such as Africa, television is gaining greater audience share than [[radio]], which has historically been the most widely accessed media platform.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Age plays a profound role in determining the balance between radio, television and the internet as the leading source of news. According to the 2017 [[Reuters]] Institute Digital News Report, in 36 countries and territories surveyed, 51 per cent of adults 55 years and older consider television as their main news source, compared to only 24 per cent of respondents between 18 and 24.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Newman, Nic, Richard Fletcher, Antonis Kalogeropoulos, David A. L. Levy, and Rasmus Kleis Nielsen. 2017. Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2017. Oxford: Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. Available at https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Digital%20News%20Report%202017%20 web_0.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The pattern is reversed when it comes to online media, chosen by 64 per cent of users between 18 and 24 as their primary source, but only by 28 per cent of users 55 and older.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  According to the Arab Youth Survey, in 2016, 45 per cent of the young people interviewed considered social media as a major source of news.&lt;ref&gt;ASDA’A Burson-Marsteller. 2016. Arab Youth Survey Middle East – Findings. Available at http://www.arabyouthsurvey.com/. Accessed 19 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Satellite television has continued to add global or transnational alternatives to national viewing options for many audiences. Global news providers such as the [[BBC News|BBC]], [[Al Jazeera]], [[Agence France-Presse]], [[RT (TV network)|RT]] (formerly Russia Today) and the Spanish-language [[EFE|Agencia EFE]], have used the internet and satellite television to better reach audiences across borders and have added specialist broadcasts to target specific foreign audiences. Reflecting a more outward looking orientation, [[China]] [[Global Television Network]] (CGTN), the multi-language and multi-channel grouping owned and operated by [[China Central Television]], changed its name from CCTV-NEWS in January 2017. After years of budget cuts and shrinking global operations, in 2016 BBC announced the launch of 12 new language services (in [[Oromo language|Afaan Oromo]], [[Amharic]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Pidgin]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], and [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]), branded as a component of its biggest expansion ‘since the 1940s’.&lt;ref&gt;BBC. 2016.

Accessed 21 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also expanding access to content are changes in usage patterns with non-linear viewing, as online streaming is becoming an important component of users’ experience. Since expanding its global service to 130 new countries in January 2016, Netflix experienced a surge in subscribers, surpassing 100 million subscribers in the second quarter of 2017, up from 40 million in 2012. The audience has also become more diverse with 47 per cent of users based outside of the United States, where the company began in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Huddleston, Tom. 2017. Netflix Has More U.S. Subscribers Than Cable TV. Fortune. Available at http://fortune.com/2017/06/15/netflix-more-subscribersthan-cable/. Accessed 21 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Newspaper industry ===
The [[Internet]] has challenged the press as an alternative source of information and opinion but has also provided a new platform for newspaper organizations to reach new audiences. Between 2012 and 2016, print newspaper circulation continued to fall in almost all regions, with the exception of Asia and the Pacific, where the dramatic increase in sales in a few select countries has offset falls in historically strong Asian markets such as [[Japan]] and the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]]. Between 2012 and 2016, [[India]]’s print circulation grew by 89 per cent.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Campbell, Cecilia. 2017. World Press Trends 2017. Frankfurt: WAN-IFRA.&lt;/ref&gt; As many newspapers make the transition to online platforms, revenues from digital subscriptions and [[Online advertising|digital advertising]] have been growing significantly. How to capture more of this growth remains a pressing challenge for newspapers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== The International Programme for Development of Communication ====
{{Main|International Programme for the Development of Communication}}
The International Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC) is a [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) programme aimed at strengthening the development of [[mass media]] in [[Developing country|developing countries]]. Its mandate since 2003 is “... to contribute to sustainable development, democracy and good governance by fostering universal access to and distribution of information and knowledge by strengthening the capacities of the developing countries and countries in transition in the field of electronic media and the printed press.&lt;ref&gt;Amendments to the Statutes of the International Programme for The Development of Communication (IPDC) Resolution 43/32,  adopted on the Report of Commission V at the 18th Plenary Meeting, on 15 October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Programme for the Development of Communication]] is responsible for the follow-up of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16 through indicators 16.10.1 and 16.10.2. Every two years, a report containing information from the Member States on the status of judicial inquiries on each of the killings condemned by UNESCO is submitted to the IPDC Council by UNESCO's Director-General.&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002460/246014E.pdf https://en.unesco.org/programme/ipdc/initiatives&lt;/ref&gt; The journalists safety indicators are a tool developed by UNESCO which, according to UNESCO's website, aims on mapping the key features that can help assess safety of journalists, and help determine whether adequate follow-up is given to crimes committed against them. The IPDC Talks also allow the Programme to raise awareness on the importance of access to information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/powering-sustainable-development-access-information/about-ipdctalks|title=About the IPDCtalks|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPDC is also the programme that monitors and reports on access to information laws around the world through the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] global report on follow-up to SDGs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On 28 September 2015, UNESCO adopted the [[Access to Information Day|International Day for the Universal Access to Information]] during its 38th session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002352/235297e.pdf |title=Images |website=unesdoc.unesco.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the International Day, the IPDC organized the “IPDC Talks: Powering Sustainable Development with Access to Information” event, which gathered high-level participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/iduai2017|title=International Day for Universal Access to Information|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual event aims on highlighting the “importance of access to information” for sustainable development.

==== The Internet Universality framework ====
{{Main|Internet Universality}}
Internet Universality is the concept that "the Internet is much more than infrastructure and applications, it is a network of economic and [[Social relation|social interactions]] and relationships, which has the potential to enable [[human rights]], empower individuals and communities, and facilitate [[sustainable development]]. The concept is based on four principles stressing the Internet should be Human rights-based, Open, Accessible, and based on [[Multistakeholder governance model|Multistakeholder]] participation. These have been abbreviated as the R-O-A-M principles. Understanding the Internet in this way helps to draw together different facets of [[Internet governance|Internet development]], concerned with technology and [[public policy]], rights and development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/internetuniversality/about|title=Internet Universality|date=10 July 2017|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|access-date=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the concept internet universality UNESCO highlights access to information as a key to assess a better Internet environment. There is special relevance to the Internet of the broader principle of social inclusion. This puts forward the role of accessibility in overcoming [[digital divide]]s, [[digital inequality|digital inequalities]], and [[Social exclusion|exclusions]] based on skills, [[literacy]], language, [[gender]] or disability. It also points to the need for [[Sustainability|sustainable]] [[business model]]s for Internet activity, and to trust in the preservation, quality, integrity, security, and authenticity of information and knowledge. Accessibility is interlinked to rights and openness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232563E.pdf|title=Keystones to foster inclusive Knowledge Societies|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|year=2015|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the ROAM principles, UNESCO is now developing Internet Universality indicators to help governments and other stakeholders assess their own national Internet environments and to promote the values associated with Internet Universality, such as access to information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/freedom-expression-internet|title=Freedom of Expression on the Internet|date=25 October 2017|website=[[UNESCO]]|language=en|access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The World Bank initiatives ===
In 2010, the [[World Bank]] launched the World Bank policy on access to information, which constitutes a major shift in the World Bank's strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/access-to-information/overview#1|title=Overview|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle binds the World Bank to disclose any requested information, unless it is on a "list of exception":

# "[[Personal information management|Personal information]]
# Communications of Governors and/or Executive Directors’ Offices
# [[Ethics]] Committee
# [[Attorney–client privilege|Attorney-Client Privilege]]
# Security and Safety Information
# Separate Disclosure Regimes
# Confidential Client/Third Party Information
# Corporate Administrative
# Deliberative Information*
# Financial Information"&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/740621437416268169/AI-Brochure-English-2015.pdf |title=Brochure |website=pubdocs.worldbank.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Bank is prone to Open Developments with its [[Open data]], Open Finance and [[Open knowledge]] repository.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== The World Summit on the Information Societies ===
{{Main|World Summit on the Information Society}}
The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) was a two-phase United Nations-sponsored summit on information, communication and, in broad terms, the [[information society]] that took place in 2003 in [[Geneva]] and in 2005 in [[Tunis]]. One of its chief aims was to bridge the [[global digital divide]] separating rich countries from poor countries by spreading access to the Internet in the [[Developing country|developing world]]. The conferences established 17 May as [[World Information Society Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.itu.int/net4/wsis/forum/2018/Pages/About|title=About – WSIS Forum 2018|website=www.itu.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regional framework ==
The results from UNESCO monitoring of [[Sustainable Development Goal 16|SDG 16]].10.2 show that 112 countries have now adopted freedom of information legislation or similar administrative regulations.&lt;ref&gt;freedominfo.org 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Of these, 22 adopted new legislation since 2012. At the regional level, [[Africa]] has seen the highest growth, with 10 countries adopting freedom of information legislation in the last five years, more than doubling the number of countries in the region to have such legislation from nine to 19. A similarly high growth rate has occurred in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region, where seven countries adopted freedom of information laws in the last five years, bringing the total to 22. In addition, during the reporting period, two countries in the [[Arab world|Arab region]], two countries in [[United Nations geoscheme for the Americas|Latin America and the Caribbean]], and one country in [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]] adopted freedom of information legislation. The vast majority of the world’s population now lives in a country with a freedom of information law, and several countries currently have freedom of information bills under consideration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== National framework ==

=== Freedom of information laws ===
{{See also|Freedom of information laws by country}}
While there has been an increase in countries with freedom of information laws, their implementation and effectiveness vary considerably across the world. The Global Right to Information Rating is a programme providing [[advocate]]s, [[legislator]]s, reformers with tools to assess the strength of a legal framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rti-rating.org/|title=Global Right to Information Rating|website=Global Right to Information Rating}}&lt;/ref&gt; In measuring the strength and legal framework of each country’s freedom of information law using the Right to Information Rating, one notable trend appears.&lt;ref&gt;Centre for Law and Democracy &amp; Access Info. 2017b. Global Right to Information Rating Map. Global Right to Information Rating. Available at http://www.rti-rating.org/. Accessed 24 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Largely regardless of [[Geography|geographic]] location, top scoring countries tend to have younger laws.&lt;ref&gt;Centre for Law and Democracy &amp; Access Info. 2017a. About. Global Right to Information Rating. Available at http://www.rti-rating.org/about/. Accessed 24 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary General]]’s 2017 report on the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], to which UNESCO contributed freedom of information-related information, of the 109 countries with available data on implementation of freedom of information laws, 43 per cent do not sufficiently provide for public outreach and 43 per cent have overly-wide definitions of exceptions to disclosure, which run counter to the aim of increased [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and [[accountability]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. 2017. Sustainable Development Goals Report 2017. Available at https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2017/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the adoption of freedom of information laws; officials are often unfamiliar with the norms of transparency at the core of freedom of information or are unwilling to recognize them in practice. [[Journalist]]s often do not make effective use of freedom of information laws for a multitude of reasons: official failure to respond to information requests, extensive delays, receipt of heavily redacted documents, arbitrarily steep fees for certain types of requests, and a lack of professional training.&lt;ref&gt;Trapnell, Stephanie (editor). 2014. Right to Information: Case Studies on Implementation. Washington D. C.: World Bank Group. Available at http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/462751468000583408/pdf/98720-WPP118353-Box393176B-PUBLIC-RTI-CaseStudies-Implementation-WEBfinal.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Debates around public access to information have also focused on further developments in encouraging [[open data]] approaches to [[Open government|government transparency]]. In 2009, the data.gov portal was launched in the United States, collecting in one place most of the government open data; in the years following, there was a wave of government data opening around the world. As part of the [[Open Government Partnership]], a multilateral network established in 2011, some 70 countries have now issued National Action Plans, the majority of which contain strong open data commitments designed to foster greater transparency, generate economic growth, empower citizens, fight corruption and more generally enhance governance. In 2015 the Open Data Charter was founded in a multistakeholder process in order to establish principles for ‘how governments should be publishing information’.&lt;ref&gt;Open Data Charter. 2017b. Who we are. Open Data Charter. Available at https://opendatacharter.net/who-we-are/. Accessed 24 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The Charter has been adopted by 17 national governments half of which were from [[United Nations geoscheme for the Americas|Latin America and the Caribbean]].&lt;ref&gt;Open Data Charter. 2017a. Adopted By. Open Data Charter. Available at https://opendatacharter.net/adopted-by-countries-and-cities/. Accessed 24 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 Open Data Barometer, conducted by the [[World Wide Web Foundation]], shows that while 79 out of the 115 countries surveyed have open government data portals, in most cases ‘the right [[Policy|policies]] are not in place, nor is the breadth and quality of the data-sets released sufficient’. In general, the Open Data Barometer found that government data is usually ‘incomplete, out of date, of low quality, and fragmented’.&lt;ref&gt;World Wide Web Foundation. 2017. Open Data Barometer: Global Report Fourth Edition. Available at http://opendatabarometer.org/doc/4thEdition/ODB-4thEditionGlobalReport.pdf. Accessed 24 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''''Basic Points Unifying the Theravāda and the Mahāyāna ''''' is an important [[Buddhist]] [[ecumenical]] statement created in 1967 during the First Congress of the [[World Buddhist Sangha Council]] (WBSC), where its founder [[Secretary-General]], the late [[Venerable (Buddhism)|Venerable]] Pandita Pimbure Sorata Thera, requested the Ven. [[Walpola Rahula]] to present a concise formula for the unification of all the different Buddhist traditions. This text was then unanimously approved by the Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Great Compassion: Buddhism and Animal Rights|first=Norm|last=Phelps|authorlink=Norm Phelps|publisher=Lantern Books|year=2004|ISBN=1590560698|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DO NOT CHANGE--&gt;Master (teacher and guide)''
# ''We take refuge in the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the ''[[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]]'' and the ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|{{IAST|Saṅgha}}]]'' (the [[Three Jewels]])''
# ''We do not believe that this world is [[Creator deity|created]] and ruled by a [[God]].
# ''We consider that the purpose of life is to develop [[compassion]] for all living beings without discrimination and to work for their good, happiness, and peace; and to develop wisdom (''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajñā]]'') leading to the realization of Ultimate Truth''
# ''We accept the [[Four Noble Truths]], namely ''[[Dukkha|{{IAST|duḥkha}}]]'', the arising of ''{{IAST|duḥkha}}'', the cessation of ''{{IAST|duḥkha}}'', and the path leading to the cessation of ''{{IAST|duḥkha}}''; and the law of cause and effect (''[[pratītyasamutpāda]]'')''
# ''All conditioned things (''[[Sankhara|{{IAST|saṃskāra}}]]'') are impermanent (''[[Impermanence|anitya]]'') and ''{{IAST|duḥkha}}'', and that all conditioned and unconditioned things (''[[dharma]]'') are without self (''[[Anatta|anātma]]'') (''see'' ''[[Three marks of existence|trilaksana]]'').''
# ''We accept the thirty-seven qualities conducive to enlightenment (''[[bodhipakṣadharma|{{IAST|bodhipakṣadharma}}]]'') as different aspects of the Path taught by the Buddha leading to Enlightenment.''
# ''There are [[Types of Buddha|three ways]] of attaining ''[[bodhi]]'' or Enlightenment: namely as a disciple (''[[Shravakabuddha|śrāvaka]]''), as a ''[[pratyekabuddha]]'' and as a ''[[Buddhahood|samyaksambuddha]]'' (perfectly and fully enlightened Buddha). We accept it as the highest, noblest, and most heroic to follow the career of a ''[[Bodhisattva]]'' and to become a ''samyaksambuddha'' in order to save others.''
# ''We admit that in different countries there are differences regarding Buddhist [[belief]]s and practices. These external forms and expressions should not be confused with the essential teachings of the Buddha.''}}

== Expansion of the formula ==
Ven. Walpola Sri Rahula in 1981 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|conference=Third International Congress World Buddhist Sangha Council|location=Taiwan|date=December 1–7, 1981|booktitle=Proceedings: Third International Congress World Buddhist Sangha Council|pages=32–35|title=One Vehicle for Peace|author=Ven. Walpola Sri Rahula|url=http://www.dhammikaweb.com/?p=7779}}&lt;/ref&gt; offered an alternative to the Nine-point formula above restating it as follows:

{{cquote|
# ''Whatever our [[sects]], denominations or systems, as Buddhists we all accept the Buddha as our [[Guru|Master]] who gave us the Teaching.''
# ''We all take refuge in the Triple Jewel: the Buddha, our Teacher; the ''Dhamma'', his teaching; and the ''Sangha'', the Community of holy ones. In other words, we take refuge in the Teacher, the Teaching and the Taught.''
# ''Whether Theravāda or Mahāyāna, we do not believe that this [[world]] is created and ruled by a god at his [[Will (philosophy)|will]].''
# ''Following the example of the Buddha, our Teacher, who is embodiment of Great Compassion (''mahā[[Karuṇā|{{IAST|karuṇa}}]]'') and Great Wisdom (''mahā[[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajñā]]''), we consider that the purpose of life is to develop compassion for all living beings without discrimination and to work for their good, happiness and peace; and to develop wisdom leading to the realization of Ultimate Truth.''
# ''We accept the Four Noble Truths taught by the Buddha, namely, ''Dukkha'', the fact that our existence in this world is in predicament, is impermanent, imperfect, unsatisfactory, full of conflict; ''[[Samudaya]]'', the fact that this state of affairs is due to our egoistic selfishness based on the false idea of self; ''[[Nirodha]]'', the fact that there is definitely the possibility of [[deliverance]], liberation, freedom from this predicament by the total eradication of the egoistic selfishness; and ''[[Magga]]'', the fact that this liberation can be achieved through the [[Middle Path]] which is eight-fold, leading to the perfection of ethical conduct (''[[Śīla|sila]]''), mental discipline (''[[samādhi (Buddhism)|samadhi]]'') and wisdom (''[[Paññā|panna]]'').''
# ''We accept the universal law of cause and effect taught in the ''[[Pratitya-samutpada|{{IAST|Paṭiccasamuppada}}]]'' (Skt. ''pratītyasamutpada''; Conditioned Genesis or Dependent Origination), and accordingly we accept that everything is [[relativism|relative]], [[Interdependence|interdependent]] and interrelated and nothing is [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]], permanent and everlasting in this universe.''
# ''We understand, according to the teaching of the Buddha, that all conditioned things (''[[Sankhara|samkhara]]'') are impermanent (''[[Impermanence|anicca]]'') and imperfect and unsatisfactory (''[[dukkha]]''), and all conditioned and unconditioned things (''[[dhamma]]'') are without self (''[[anatta]]'').''
# ''We accept the Thirty-seven Qualities conducive to Enlightenment (''[[bodhipakkhiyadhamma]]'') as different aspects of the Path taught by the Buddha leading to Enlightenment, namely:''
#* ''Four Forms of Presence of Mindfulness (Pali: ''[[satipatthana]]''; Skt. ''smrtyupasthana'');''
#* ''Four Right Efforts (Pali. ''[[sammappadhana]]''; Skt. ''[[samyakpradhana]]'');''
#* ''Four Bases of Supernatural Powers (Pali. ''[[iddhipada]]''; Skt. ''[[rddhipada]]'');''
#* ''Five Faculties (''[[indriya]]'': Pali. ''[[saddha]], [[viriya]], [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|sati]], [[samādhi (Buddhism)|samadhi]], [[Paññā|panna]]''; Skt. ''[[Śraddhā|sraddha]], [[virya]], [[smrti]], [[samādhi (Buddhism)|samadhi]], [[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]]'');''
#* ''Five Powers (''[[The Five Powers|bala]]'', same five qualities as above);''
#* ''Seven Factors of Enlightenment (Pali. ''[[bojjhanga]]''; Skt. ''[[bodhyanga]]'');''
#* ''[[Eight-fold Noble Path]] (Pali. ''[[ariyamagga]]''; Skt. ''[[aryamarga]]'').''
# ''There are three ways of attaining ''[[Bodhi]]'' or [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|Enlightenment]] according to the ability and capacity of each individual: namely, as a ''[[Śrāvaka]]'' (disciple), as a ''[[Pratyekabuddha]]'' (Individual Buddha) and as a ''[[Samyaksambuddha]]'' (Perfectly and Fully Enlightened Buddha). We accept it as the highest, noblest and most heroic to follow the career of a ''[[Bodhisattva]]'' and to become a ''[[Samyksambuddha]]'' in order to save others. But these three states are on the same Path, not on different paths. In fact, the ''[[Sandhinirmocana Sutra|Sandhinirmocana-sutra]]'', a well-known important Mahayana [[sutra]], clearly and emphatically says that those who follow the line of ''[[Śrāvakayāna]]'' (Vehicle of Disciples) or the line of ''[[Pratyekabuddhayāna]]'' (Vehicle of Individual Buddhas) or the line of ''[[Tathāgata|Tathāgatas]]'' (Mahayana) attain the supreme Nirvana by the same Path, and that for all of them there is only one Path of Purification (''visuddhi-[[Buddhist Paths to liberation|marga]]'') and only one Purification (''[[Vishuddha|visuddhi]]'') and no second one, and that they are not different paths and different purifications, and that ''Śrāvakayāna'' and ''Mahayana'' constitute One Vehicle One Yana (''[[ekayāna]]'') and not distinct and different vehicles or [[Yana (Buddhism)|yanas]].''
# ''We admit that in different countries there are differences with regard to the [[way of life|ways of life]] of Buddhist monks, popular Buddhist beliefs and practices, [[rites]] and [[rituals]], ceremonies, customs and habits. These external forms and expressions should not be confused with the essential teachings of the Buddha.''}}

'''Bodymind''' is an approach to understand the relationship between the human [[Human body|body]] and [[mind]] in which they are seen as a single integrated unit. It attempts to address the [[mind–body problem]] and is in contrast to the traditions of [[mind–body dualism]] and [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]].

In the field of [[alternative medicine]], bodymind implies that:  
* The body, mind, emotions, and spirit are dynamically interrelated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness|last = Damasio|first = Antonio|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0156010757|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Experience, including physical stress, emotional injury, and pleasures are stored in the body's cells which in turn affects one's reactions to stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Keleman, Stanley: ''Your Body speaks its Mind'', Center Press (US) (1989) {{ISBN|978-0934320016}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The term can be applied across a number of disciplines, including:
* [[Psychoneuroimmunology]], the study of the interaction between psychological processes and the nervous and immune systems of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Michael Irwin| first = Kavita Vedhara | title = Human Psychoneuroimmunology| publisher = Oxford University Press|year=2005| isbn = 978-0-19-856884-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

USA (1984) (2nd edit. 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term overlaps in significant ways, especially in its anti-dualist intention, with the philosophical term mindbody developed independently by philosopher [[William H. Poteat]].

'''Committee for Civil Liberties and Legal Aid''' in short Civil Liberties Committee was a forum in Bangladesh formed by the members of civil society to restore the civil liberties and provide legal aid to the dissenting population of the country who were the victims of [[Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2006/11/10/d61110013527.htm|title= Enayetullah's first death anniversary today|publisher=The Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhakacourier.com.bd/in-the-shadows-under-the-gaze/|title= In the shadows, under the gaze|publisher=Dhaka Courier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Headed by eminent poet [[Sikandar Abu Zafar]], the committee consisted a total of 33 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jugantor.com/old/sub-editorial/2014/02/23/71683|title= বিচারবহির্ভূত হত্যাকাণ্ডের ভয়াবহ নতুন পর্যায়|publisher=Daily Jugantor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forum was floated on 31 March 1974 through a press briefing at the National Press Club of capital city [[Dhaka]]. The committee was highly critical to the government and many of its member were either arrested of were compelled to go underground.

==Background==
After the [[Liberation War of Bangladesh]], [[Awami League]] formed the government ignoring the call from most of the political parties to form a government of national consensus. Soon after consolidating power, [[Awami League]] government established a new paramilitary force [[Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini]] in March 1972 which was blamed for crushing anti-government protests brutally and getting engaged in deadly confrontations with the opposition parties.

===Political killing===
By 1973, according to President of [[Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal]] Major [[M. A. Jalil]], the number of politically motivated murders reached 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.scribd.com/doc/164645464/Rising-Bangladesh-Unrest-Marked-by-2-000-Killings-and-The-Role-of-Sheikh-Mujibur-Rahman|title= Rising Bangladesh unrest marked by 2000 killings|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the prominent politicians [[Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal|Jasad]] Vice-President Mosharraf Hossain, [[Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal|Jasad]] supported Krishak League leader Siddiq Master, Manikganj [[Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal|Jasad]] Joint Secretary Sadat Hossain Badal, [[Jahangirnagar University]] Central Students' Union general secretary Borhanuddin Rokon were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.prothom-alo.com/opinion/article/35332/%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%95%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%B7%E0%A7%80%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B9%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%80%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%89%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%A5%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A8-%E0%A6%93-%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B9%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%BF|title= রক্ষীবাহিনী|publisher=Daily Prothom Alo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 18-years-old boy Shahjahan Sharif from Naria upazila of [[Faridpur District|Faridpur]] went missing from the Rakkhi Bahini custody in January 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Moudud, ''Era of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman'', First published 1983, p. 69, University Press Limited, Dhaka, {{ISBN|978-984-506-226-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disappearance of Shahjahan made his family to move to court and filed a case against [[Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini]]. Justice Debesh Chandra Battacharya after hearing both the parties in his historical verdict said that,

{{quote|the irregularity and very unsatisfactory manner of the handling of the matter by the Rakkhi Bahini has created a situation that urgently calls for an effective action on the part of the authorities to clear the cloud and create a sense of assurance in the mind of the people.}}

===Special Power Act, 1974===
In February 1974, the parliament passed Special Power Act 1974 to make provisions for preventive detentions.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Moudud, ''Era of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman'', First published 1983, p. 180, University Press Limited, Dhaka, {{ISBN|978-984-506-226-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 3 of the Special Power Act provided for preventive detentions. A person was to be detained if the Government was satisfied that it was necessary to do so.

===Ramna massacre===
''See More [[1974 Ramna massacre]]''

[[Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal|Jasad]] called for a meeting to protest the authoritarian rule of the Government on 17 March 1974. The meeting was followed by a march to surround the resident of Home Minister [[Muhammad Mansur Ali]] after the rally which subsequently went violent.

The incident claimed at least fifty lives when the Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini was called on and eventually opened fire targeting the protesters.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad, Mahiuddin, ''জাসদের উত্থান ও পতনঃ অস্থির সময়ের রাজনীতি'', First published 2015, p. 111, Prothoma Prakashani, [[Dhaka]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of cases were filed against [[Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal|Jasad]] politicians. [[A. S. M. Abdur Rab]], [[Shajahan Siraj]] and almost all the bigwigs of the party landed in jail. [[Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini]] started a drive to hunt down all the supporters of Jasad after that. Police and Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini personnel raided the office of ''Ganakantha'' and arrested the editor, [[Al Mahmud]].

==Key personnel==

The committee was formed with 33 members of civil society. They were from different background that included teachers, engineers, lawyers, doctors, writers, poets and journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jugantor.com/old/sub-editorial/2014/02/23/71683|title= বিচারবহির্ভূত হত্যাকাণ্ডের ভয়াবহ নতুন পর্যায়|publisher=Daily Jugantor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad, Mahiuddin, ''জাসদের উত্থান ও পতনঃ অস্থির সময়ের রাজনীতি'', First published 2015, p. 111, Prothoma Prakashani, [[Dhaka]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The first meeting of the committee was held at the National Press Club in [[Dhaka]] on 31 March 1974 and was presided over by Professor [[Ahmed Sharif]].

The prominent figures of the committee are:
 
* [[Sikandar Abu Zafar]] as President
* [[Mirza Ghulam Hafiz]] in charge of Legal analysis
* Professor [[Ahmed Sharif]] in charge of Publication
* Vinod Das Gupta in charge of Investigation
* Abdul Huq in charge of Legal aid

* Syed Zafar as Assistant general secretary
* [[Jasimuddin]] 
* [[Badruddin Umar]] 
* [[Muhammad Habibur Rahman]] 
* [[Ahmed Sofa]] 
* Mohiuddin Alamgir 
* Kamrunnahar Laili

==Demands==
The committee came under the same umbrella on some demands:&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Moudud, ''Era of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman'', First published 1983, p. 263, University Press Limited, Dhaka, {{ISBN|978-984-506-226-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Withdrawal of laws not consistent with the constitution and termination of attack on fundamental rights by the various government forces and administrative machineries
# Immediate repeal of undemocratic Special Powers Act
# Repeal of the Rakkhi Bahini Act and withdrawal of troops who were all engaged in brutal activities
# Release of all political prisoners detained in different jails of the country
# Restoration of freedom of press and release of all newspaper workers including [[Al Mahmud]]

==Activities==
The committee was vocal against the repression of the government and the offences of the government forces. Several meetings and dialogues were held under the banner of the committee.

One of the most discussed event of the committee was a large public meeting which was held in front of national mosque Baitul Muqarram in Dhaka to express solidarity with the suffering people. The committee held the [[Awami League]] responsible for the [[Bangladesh famine of 1974]].

Veteran journalist and a member of the committee, [[A.Z.M. Enayetullah Khan]], was highly critical to the government excesses in handling of the opposition parties and dissenting groups and wrote a series of editorials against the government. He was subsequently arrested for his articles. General Secretary of the committee [[Moudud Ahmed]] was also arrested for being critical to the government and providing legal aid to the victims of government agencies. 

[[Ahmed Sofa]] was chased by [[Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman|Bangabandhu]]'s son [[Sheikh Kamal]] in New Market area of [[Dhaka]] for criticising the government. He later went into hiding at [[Comilla]] [[Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development|BARD]].

[[File:Tihanyi The Critic.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''Critic'' by [[Lajos Tihanyi]]. Oil on canvas, c.1916.]]

A '''critic''' is a professional who communicates an assessment and an opinion of various forms of creative works such as art, literature, music, cinema, theater, fashion, architecture, and food. Critics may also take as their subject social or government policy. Critical judgments, whether derived from [[critical thinking]] or not, weigh up a range of factors, including an assessment of the extent to which the item under review achieves its purpose and its creator's intention and a knowledge of its context. They may also include a positive or negative personal response.

Characteristics of a good critic are articulateness, preferably having the ability to use language with a high level of appeal and skill. Sympathy, sensitivity and insight are important too. Form, style and medium are all considered by the critic. In architecture and food criticism, the item's function, value and cost may be added components.

Critics are publicly accepted and, to a significant degree, followed because of the quality of their assessments or their reputation. Influential critics of art, music, theatre and architecture often present their arguments in complete books. One very famous example is [[John Ruskin]]'s ''[[Seven Lamps of Architecture]]'' and ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]''. Critics may base their assessment on a range of theoretical positions. For instance, they may take a Feminist or Freudian perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdP2BgxsM3wC|title=The Feminist Spectator as Critic|last=Dolan|first=Jill|date=2012-10-24|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0472035193|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other individuals who may editorialize on subjects via websites or letters written to publications, professional critics are paid to produce their assessment and opinions for print, radio, magazine, television, or Internet companies. When their personal opinion outweighs considered judgment, people who give opinions, whether on current events, public affairs, sports, media or art are often referred to as "[[pundits]]" instead of critics.

Critics are themselves subject to competing critics, since the final critical judgment always entails some [[subjectivity]]. An established critic can play a powerful role as a public [[arbitration|arbiter]] of taste or opinion. Also, critics or a coordinated group of critics, may award symbols of recognition.

== Derivation ==

The word "critic" comes {{ety|gre|''κριτικός'' (kritikós)|able to discern}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkritiko%2Fs Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus], ''Kritikos'', Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a Greek derivation of the word {{lang|grc|κριτής}} ''(krités)'', meaning a person who offers reasoned judgment or analysis, value judgment, interpretation or observation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkrith%2Fs Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus], ''Krites'', Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott.&lt;/ref&gt; Early English meaning of criticism was based mainly on the criticism of literature and it was in the 17th century that more general forms of criticism began.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

== Critics' views of criticism ==

Cultural critic [[Clement Greenberg]] wrote that a good critic excels through "insights into the evidence … and by … loyalty to the relevant"; poet and critic [[T. S. Eliot|T.S. Eliot]] wrote "a critic must have a very highly developed sense of fact".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Art and Culture – Critical Essays|last = Greenberg|first = Clement|publisher = Beacon Press|year = 1961|isbn = |location = Boston|page = 239|chapter = T.S. Eliot: A Book Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, [[Harold C. Schonberg]], chief music critic of ''[[The New York Times]]'' from 1960 to 1980, said that he wrote for himself, &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;not necessarily for readers, not for musicians. ...It's not a critic's job to be right or wrong; it's his job to express an opinion in readable English.&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/27/nyregion/harold-c-schonberg-87-dies-won-pulitzer-prize-as-music-critic-for-the-times.html|title=Harold C. Schonberg, 87, Dies; Won Pulitzer Prize as Music Critic for ''The Times''|last=Kozinn|first=Allan|date=2003-07-27|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schonberg was the first music critic to receive the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for [[criticism]].

[[Daniel Mendelsohn]] described the equation of criticism for critics as [[knowledge]] + [[Taste (sociology)|taste]] = meaningful [[judgement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/a-critics-manifesto|title=A Critic’s Manifesto|last=Mendelsohn|first=Daniel|date=2012-08-28|newspaper=The New Yorker|issn=0028-792X|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/everyones-a-critic-1455147994|title=Everyone’s a Critic|last=Spiegelman|first=Willard|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Restaurant critic Terry Durack explained that from a critic "you hope for a thorough, objective and legitimate discussion" that puts "opera, art or book into context, so that it adds to your own body of knowledge"; in the context of a restaurant criticism, this means it is "not about me liking it or not; it's about me helping you decide whether you are going to like it or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/good-weekend/the-role-of-a-restaurant-critic-in-the-digital-age-20161201-gt1ndf.html|title=The role of a restaurant critic in the digital age|last=Durack|first=Terry|date=3 December 2016|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=5 December 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotebox|quote=''Rothko's dilemma was that he wanted to employ the vocabulary of symbolism{{snds}}the palpitating indeterminate space, the excruciatingly refined colour, the obsession with nuance, the presence of Mallarmé's "negated object"{{snds}}to render the patriarchal despair and elevation of the Old Testament. Criticism doesn't get sharper, or more sensitive, or more deeply sympathetic to the object, than that.''

== Social and political critics ==

Social and political critics have used various forms of art to express their criticism, including literature and music. [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], for example, prior to the [[French Revolution]], used his play [[The Marriage of Figaro (play)|''The Marriage of Figaro'']] to denounce aristocratic privilege. A critic's influence is enhanced by subsequent reworkings such as the operatic versions of Beaumarchais's play (''[[The Barber of Seville]]'') by [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and (''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'') by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. Among the most famous social/political criticism in literary form are [[Jonathan Swift|Jonathan Swift's]] [[satire]] ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and [[George Orwell]]'s satire ''[[Animal Farm]]''. Some political critics, such as [[Ai Weiwei]] use visual art as their medium.

{{democracy}}

'''Democratic peace theory''' is a theory which posits that [[democracy|democracies]] are hesitant to engage in [[armed conflict]] with other identified democracies.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Doyle's pioneering work "Kant, Liberal Legacies, and Foreign Affairs", Philosophy and Public Affairs (1983) 205, 207–208, initially applied this international relations paradigm to what he called "Liberal states" which are identified as entities "with some form of representative democracy, a market economy based on private property rights, and constitutional protections of civil and political rights." This theory has been alternately referred to as the "Liberal peace theory" For example, Clemens Jr., Walter C. Complexity Theory as a Tool for Understanding and Coping with Ethnic Conflict and Development Issues in Post-Soviet Eurasia. International Journal of Peace Studies.{{cite web |url=http://www.gmu.edu/academic/ijps/vol7_2/Clemens.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005074537/http://www.gmu.edu/academic/ijps/vol7_2/Clemens.htm |archivedate=October 5, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to theories explaining war engagement, it is a "theory of peace" outlining motives that dissuade state-sponsored violence.

Some theorists prefer terms such as "mutual democratic pacifism"&lt;ref name="flawed-logic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/flawed-logic-democratic-peace-theory-6/|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130128154830/http://www.mendeley.com/research/flawed-logic-democratic-peace-theory-6/|deadurl=yes|title=The Flawed Logic of Democratic Pe... preview &amp; related info - Mendeley|author=|date=January 28, 2013|archivedate=January 28, 2013|website=mendeley.com|accessdate=May 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "inter-democracy nonaggression hypothesis" so as to clarify that a state of [[peace]] is not singular to democracies, but rather that it is easily sustained between democratic nations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniele Archibugi]], [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8737.html The Global Commonwealth of Citizens. Toward Cosmopolitan Democracy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415220239/http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8737.html |date=April 15, 2010 }}, Princeton University Press, [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among proponents of the democratic peace theory, several factors are held as motivating peace between democratic states:
*Democratic leaders are forced to accept culpability for war losses to a voting public;
*Publicly accountable statespeople are inclined to establish diplomatic institutions for resolving international tensions;
*Democracies are not inclined to view countries with adjacent policy and governing doctrine as hostile;
*Democracies tend to possess greater public wealth than other states, and therefore eschew war to preserve infrastructure and resources.

Those who dispute this theory often do so on grounds that it [[correlation does not imply causation|conflates correlation with causation]], and that the academic definitions of 'democracy' and 'war' can be manipulated so as to manufacture an artificial trend.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Pugh, Jeffrey (April 2005).

==History==
[[Image:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|Immanuel Kant]]
Though the democratic peace theory was not rigorously or scientifically studied until the 1960s, the basic principles of the concept had been argued as early as the 1700s in the works of philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] and political theorist [[Thomas Paine]]. Kant foreshadowed the theory in his essay ''[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]'' written in 1795, although he thought that a world with only constitutional republics was only one of several necessary conditions for a perpetual peace. Kant's theory was that a majority of the people would never vote to go to war, unless in self-defense. Therefore, if all nations were republics, it would end war, because there would be no aggressors. In earlier but less cited works, Thomas Paine made similar or stronger claims about the peaceful nature of republics. Paine wrote in "Common Sense" in 1776: "The Republics of Europe are all (and we may say always) in peace." Paine argued that kings would go to war out of pride in situations where republics would not.&lt;ref&gt;Jack S. Levy, William R. Thompson, ''Causes of War'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011); Thomas Paine, The Complete Writings of Thomas Paine, ed. Philip S. Foner (The Citadel Press: New York, 1945), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; French historian and social scientist [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] also argued, in ''[[Democracy in America]]'' (1835&amp;ndash;1840), that democratic nations were less likely to wage war.&lt;ref&gt;"When the principle of equality spreads, as in Europe now, not only within one nation, but at the same time among several neighboring peoples, the inhabitants of these various countries, despite different languages, customs, and laws, always resemble each other in an equal fear of war and love of peace. In vain do ambitious or angry princes arm for war; in spite of themselves they are calmed down by some sort of general apathy and goodwill which makes the sword fall from their hands. Wars become rarer." Tocqueville, Alexis de (1988). ''Democracy in America''. Edited by J. P. Mayer. New York: Harper Perennial, pp. 659-660&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dean Babst]], a criminologist, was the first to do statistical research on this topic. His academic paper supporting the theory was published in 1964 in ''Wisconsin Sociologist''; he published a slightly more popularized version, in 1972, in the trade journal ''Industrial Research''. Both versions initially received little attention.

[[Melvin Small]] and [[J. David Singer]] (1976: 50–69) responded; they found an absence of wars between democratic states with two "marginal exceptions", but denied that this pattern had statistical significance. This paper was published in the ''Jerusalem Journal of International Relations'' which finally brought more widespread attention to the theory, and started the academic debate. A 1983 paper by political scientist [[Michael W. Doyle]] contributed further to popularizing the theory. [[R. J. Rummel|Rudolph J. Rummel]] was another early researcher and drew considerable lay attention to the subject in his later works.

Maoz &amp; Abdolali (1989) extended the research to lesser conflicts than wars. Bremer (1992) and Maoz &amp; Russett (1993) found the correlation between democracy and peacefulness remained significant after controlling for many possible confounding variables. This moved the theory into the mainstream of social science. Supporters of [[realism in international relations]] and others responded by raising many new objections. Other researchers attempted more systematic explanations of how democracy might cause peace (Köchler 1995), and of how democracy might also affect other aspects of foreign relations such as alliances and collaboration (Ray 2003).

There have been numerous further studies in the field since these pioneering works.&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/BIBLIO.HTML bibliography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124031246/http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/BIBLIO.HTML |date=November 24, 2005 }} on Rummel's website. Rummel is partisan, and the bibliography lacks some recent papers, but is nonetheless one of the better introductions to the subject.&lt;/ref&gt; Most studies have found some form of democratic peace exists, although neither methodological disputes nor doubtful cases are entirely resolved (Kinsella 2005).

==Definitions==
Research on the democratic peace theory has to define "democracy" and "peace" (or, more often, "war").

===Defining democracy===
Democracies have been defined differently by different theorists and researchers; this accounts for some of the variations in their findings. Some examples:

Small and Singer (1976) define democracy as a nation that (1) holds periodic elections in which the opposition parties are as free to run as government parties, (2) allows at least 10% of the adult population to vote, and (3) has a parliament that either controls or enjoys parity with the executive branch of the government.

Doyle (1983) requires (1) that "liberal regimes" have market or private property economics, (2) they have policies that are internally sovereign, (3) they have citizens with juridical rights, and (4) they have representative governments. Either 30% of the adult males were able to vote or it was possible for every man to acquire voting rights as by attaining enough property. He allows greater power to hereditary monarchs than other researchers; for example, he counts the rule of [[Louis-Philippe of France]] as a liberal regime.

Ray (1995) requires that at least 50% of the adult population is allowed to vote and that there has been at least one peaceful, constitutional transfer of executive power from one independent political party to another by means of an election. This definition excludes long periods often viewed as democratic. For example, the United States until 1800, India from independence until 1979, and Japan until 1993 were all under one-party rule, and thus would not be counted under this definition (Ray 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;100).

Rummel (1997) states that "By democracy is meant liberal democracy, where those who hold power are elected in competitive elections with a secret ballot and wide franchise (loosely understood as including at least 2/3 of adult males); where there is freedom of speech, religion, and organization; and a constitutional framework of law to which the government is subordinate and that guarantees equal rights."

====Non-binary classifications====
The above definitions are binary, classifying nations into either democracies or non-democracies. Many researchers have instead used more finely grained scales. One example is the [[Polity data series]] which scores each state on two scales, one for democracy and one for autocracy, for each year since 1800; as well as several others.&lt;ref&gt;Other such rankings have made by Steve Chan and by Ze'ev Maoz (Maoz 1997). See also {{cite web |title=Conflict Data Set |work=Stockholm International Peace Research Institute |url=http://www.sipri.org/contents/conflict/conflictdatasets.html |accessdate=October 3, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050117203955/http://www.sipri.org/contents/conflict/conflictdatasets.html |archivedate=January 17, 2005 }} and {{cite web|title=Data|work=Peter D. Watson Center for Conflict and Cooperation|url=http://www.watson.rochester.edu/resources/data.html|accessdate=October 3, 2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050827105653/http://www.watson.rochester.edu/resources/data.html|archivedate=August 27, 2005|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the Polity Data has varied. Some researchers have done correlations between the democracy scale and belligerence; others have treated it as a binary classification by (as its maker does) calling all states with a high democracy score and a low autocracy score democracies; yet others have used the difference of the two scores, sometimes again making this into a binary classification (Gleditsch 1992).

====Young democracies====
Several researchers have observed that many of the possible exceptions to the democratic peace have occurred when at least one of the involved democracies was very young. Many of them have therefore added a qualifier, typically stating that the peacefulness apply to democracies older than three years (Doyle 1983, Russett 1993, Rummel 1997, Weart 1998). Rummel (1997) argues that this is enough time for "democratic procedures to be accepted, and democratic culture to settle in." Additionally, this may allow for other states to actually come to the recognition of the state as a democracy.

Mansfield and [[Jack Snyder (academic)|Snyder]] (2002, 2005), while agreeing that there have been no wars between mature liberal democracies, state that countries in transition to democracy are especially likely to be involved in wars. They find that democratizing countries are even more warlike than stable democracies, stable autocracies or even countries in transition towards autocracy. So, they suggest caution in eliminating these wars from the analysis, because this might hide a negative aspect of the process of democratization.&lt;ref&gt;See (Owen 2005) for an online description.&lt;/ref&gt; A reanalysis of the earlier study's statistical results {{Harvard citation|Braumoeller|2004}} emphasizes that the above relationship between democratization and war can only be said to hold for those democratizing countries where the executive lacks sufficient power, independence, and institutional strength. A review {{Harvard citation|Ray|2003}} cites several other studies finding that the increase in the risk of war in democratizing countries happens only if many or most of the surrounding nations are undemocratic. If wars between young democracies are included in the analysis, several studies and reviews still find enough evidence supporting the stronger claim that all democracies, whether young or established, go into war with one another less frequently (Ray 1998), (Ray 2003), {{Harvard citation|Hegre|2004}}, while some do not {{Harvard citation|Schwartz|Skinner|2002}}.

===Defining war===
Quantitative research on international wars usually define war as a military conflict with more than 1000 killed in battle in one year. This is the definition used in the [[Correlates of War|Correlates of War Project]] which has also supplied the data for many studies on war. It turns out that most of the military conflicts in question fall clearly above or below this threshold (Ray 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;103).

Some researchers have used different definitions. For example, Weart (1998) defines war as more than 200 battle deaths. Russett (1993, p.&amp;nbsp;50), when looking at Ancient Greece, only requires some real battle engagement, involving on both sides forces under state authorization.

[[Militarized Interstate Dispute]]s (MIDs), in the Correlates of War Project classification, are lesser conflicts than wars. Such a conflict may be no more than military display of force with no battle deaths. MIDs and wars together are "militarized interstate conflicts" or MICs. MIDs include the conflicts that precede a war; so the difference between MIDs and MICs may be less than it appears.

[[Statistical analysis]] and concerns about [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] are the primary reasons for using MID's instead of actual wars. Wars are relatively rare. An average ratio of 30 MIDs to one war provides a richer statistical environment for analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.ku.edu.tr/~mmousseau/Mous_Shi_JPR_Nov99.pdf ''Reverse Causality'', Mosseau and Shi, 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717073651/http://home.ku.edu.tr/~mmousseau/Mous_Shi_JPR_Nov99.pdf |date=July 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monadic vs. dyadic peace===
Most research is regarding the ''[[:wikt:dyad|dyadic]]'' peace, that democracies do not fight one another. Very few researchers have supported the ''monadic'' peace, that democracies are more peaceful in general. There are some recent papers that find a slight monadic effect. Müller and Wolff (2004), in listing them, agree "that democracies on average might be slightly, but not strongly, less warlike than other states," but general "monadic explanations is neither necessary nor convincing." They note that democracies have varied greatly in their belligerence against non-democracies.

==Possible exceptions==
{{Main|List of wars between democracies}}
Some scholars support the democratic peace on probabilistic grounds: since many wars have been fought since democracies first arose, we might expect a proportionate number of wars to have occurred between democracies, if democracies fought each other as freely as other pairs of states; but proponents of democratic peace theory claim that the number is much less than might be expected.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer (1992, 1993); Gelditsch (1992), Doyle (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; However, opponents of the theory argue this is mistaken and claim there are numerous examples of wars between democracies.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Thomas; Skinner, Kiron K. (2002). "The Myth of the Democratic Peace". ''Orbis'' (Foreign Policy Research Institute) 46 (1): 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, cases commonly cited as exceptions include the [[Sicilian Expedition]], the [[Spanish–American War]], and more recently the [[Kargil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/demowar.htm|title=War Between Democracies|publisher=|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230112813/http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/demowar.htm|archivedate=December 30, 2005|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doyle (1983) cites the [[Paquisha War]] and the Lebanese air force's intervention in the [[Six-Day War]]. The total number of cases suggested in the literature is at least 50. The data set Bremer (1993) was using showed one exception, the [[French-Thai War]] of 1940; Gleditsch (1995) sees the (somewhat technical) state of war between [[Finland]] and [[UK]] during [[World War II]], as a special case, which should probably be treated separately: an incidental state of war between democracies during large multi-polar wars (Gowa 1999; Maoz 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;165). However, the UK did bomb Finland, implying the war was not only on paper. Page Fortna (2004) discusses the 1974 [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] and the [[Kargil War]] as exceptions, finding the latter to be the most significant. However, the status of these countries as being truly democratic is a matter of debate. For instance, in Spain in 1898, two parties alternated in the government in a controlled process known as ''el turno pacífico'', and the caciques, powerful local figures, were used to manipulate election results, and as a result resentment of the system slowly built up over time and important nationalist movements as well as unions started to form. Similarly, the Turkish intervention in Cyprus occurred only after the Cypriot elected government was abolished in a coup sponsored by the military government of Greece.

Limiting the theory to only truly stable and genuine democracies leads to a very restrictive set of highly prosperous nations with little incentive in armed conflict that might harm their economies, in which the theory might be expected to hold virtually by definition.

One advocate of the democratic peace explains that his reason to choose a definition of democracy sufficiently restrictive to exclude ''all'' wars between democracies are what "might be disparagingly termed ''public relations''": students and politicians will be more impressed by such a claim than by claims that wars between democracies are less likely.{{sfnp|Ray|1998|p=89}}

==Statistical difficulties due to newness of democracy==
[[Image:Number of nations 1800-2003 scoring 8 or higher on Polity IV scale.png|thumb|right|350px|Number of nations 1800–2003 scoring 8 or higher on [[Polity data series|Polity IV scale]]. There have been no wars and in Wayman's (2002) listing of interliberal MIDs no conflict causing any battle deaths between these nations.]]

One problem with the research on wars is that, as the [[Realism in international relations|Realist]] Mearsheimer (1990, p.&amp;nbsp;50) put it, "democracies have been few in number over the past two centuries, and thus there have been few opportunities where democracies were in a position to fight one another". Democracies have been very rare until recently. Even looser definitions of democracy, such as Doyle's, find only a dozen democracies before the late nineteenth century, and many of them short-lived or with limited franchise (Doyle 1983), (Doyle 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;261). [[Freedom House]] finds no independent state with [[universal suffrage]] in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Freedom House. 1999. "Democracy’s Century: A Survey of Global Political Change in the 20th Century."&lt;/ref&gt;

Wayman (1998), a supporter of the theory, states that "If we rely solely on whether there has been an inter-democratic war, it is going to take many more decades of peace to build our confidence in the stability of the democratic peace".

===Studying lesser conflicts===
Many researchers have reacted to this limitation by studying lesser conflicts instead, since they have been far more common. There have been many more MIDs than wars; the Correlates of War Project counts several thousand during the last two centuries. A review {{Harvard citation|Ray|2003}} lists many studies that have reported that democratic pairs of states are less likely to be involved in MIDs than other pairs of states.

Another study {{Harvard citation|Hensel|Goertz|Diehl|2000}} finds that after both states have become democratic, there is a decreasing probability for MIDs within a year and this decreases almost to zero within five years.

When examining the inter-liberal MIDs in more detail, one study {{Harvard citation|Wayman|2002}} finds that they are less likely to involve third parties, and that the target of the hostility is less likely to reciprocate, if the target reciprocates the response is usually proportional to the provocation, and the disputes are less likely to cause any loss of life. The most common action was "Seizure of Material or Personnel".

Studies find that the probability that disputes between states will be resolved peacefully is positively affected by the degree of democracy exhibited by the lesser democratic state involved in that dispute. Disputes between democratic states are significantly shorter than disputes involving at least one undemocratic state. Democratic states are more likely to be amenable to third party mediation when they are involved in disputes with each other {{Harvard citation|Ray|2003}}.

In international crises that include the threat or use of military force, one study finds that if the parties are democracies, then relative military strength has no effect on who wins. This is different from when nondemocracies are involved. These results are the same also if the conflicting parties are formal allies {{Harvard citation|Gelpi|Griesdorf|2001}}. Similarly, a study of the behavior of states that joined ongoing militarized disputes reports that power is important only to autocracies: democracies do not seem to base their alignment on the power of the sides in the dispute {{Harvard citation|Werner|Lemke|1997}}.

==Conflict initiation==
According to a 2017 review study, "there is enough evidence to conclude that democracy does cause peace at least between democracies, that the observed correlation between democracy and peace is not spurious."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Dan|date=2017-01-25|title=Is Democracy a Cause of Peace?|url=http://politics.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-287|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.287|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170615162031/http://politics.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-287|archivedate=June 15, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most studies have looked only at who is involved in the conflicts and ignored the question of who initiated the conflict. In many conflicts both sides argue that the other side was initiator. Several researchers, as described in (Gleditsch, Christiansen &amp; Hegre 2004), have argued that studying conflict initiation is of limited value, because existing data about conflict initiation may be especially unreliable. Even so, several studies have examined this. Reiter and Stam (2003) argue that autocracies initiate conflicts against democracies more frequently than democracies do against autocracies. Quackenbush and Rudy (2006), while confirming Reiter and Stam's results, find that democracies initiate wars against nondemocracies more frequently than nondemocracies do to each other. Several following studies (Peceny &amp; Beer 2003), (Peceny &amp; Butler 2004), (Lai &amp; Slater 2006) have studied how different types of autocracies with different institutions vary regarding conflict initiation. Personalistic and military dictatorships may be particularly prone to conflict initiation, as compared to other types of autocracy such as [[One-party state|one party]] states, but also more likely to be targeted in a war having other initiators.

One 2017 study found that democracies are no less likely to settle border disputes peacefully than non-democracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gibler|first=Douglas M.|last2=Owsiak|first2=Andrew P.|title=Democracy and the Settlement of International Borders, 1919 to 2001|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717708599|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|language=en|doi=10.1177/0022002717708599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal violence and genocide==
Most of this article discusses research on relations between states. However, there is also evidence that democracies have less internal systematic violence. For instance, one study finds that the most democratic and the most authoritarian states have few [[civil war]]s, and intermediate regimes the most. The probability for a civil war is also increased by political change, regardless whether toward greater democracy or greater autocracy. Intermediate regimes continue to be the most prone to civil war, regardless of the time since the political change. In the long run, since intermediate regimes are less stable than autocracies, which in turn are less stable than democracies, durable democracy is the most probable end-point of the process of [[democratization]] {{Harvard citation|Hegre|Ellington|Gates|Gleditsch|2001}}. Abadie (2004) study finds that the most democratic nations have the least terrorism. Harff (2003) finds that [[genocide]] and [[politicide]] are rare in democracies. Rummel (1997) finds that the more democratic a regime, the less its [[democide]]. He finds that democide has killed six times as many people as battles.

Davenport and Armstrong (2004) lists several other studies and states: "Repeatedly, democratic political systems have been found to decrease political bans, censorship, torture, disappearances and mass killing, doing so in a linear fashion across diverse measurements, methodologies, time periods, countries, and contexts." It concludes: "Across measures and methodological techniques, it is found that below a certain level, democracy has no impact on human rights violations, but above this level democracy influences repression in a negative and roughly linear manner." Davenport and Armstrong (2003) states that thirty years worth of statistical research has revealed that only two variables decrease human rights violations: political democracy and economic development.

Abulof and Ogen add a caveat, focusing on the contemporary Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Statistically, a MENA democracy makes a country more prone to both the onset and incidence of civil war, and the more democratic a MENA state is, the more likely it is to experience violent intrastate strife. Moreover, [[Anocracy|anocracies]] do not seem to be predisposed to civil war, either worldwide or in MENA. Looking for causality beyond correlation, they suggest that democracy’s pacifying effect is partly mediated through societal subscription to self-determination and popular sovereignty. This may turn “democratizing nationalism” to a long-term prerequisite, not just an immediate hindrance, to peace and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abulof | first1 = Uriel | last2 = Goldman | first2 = Ogen | title = The Domestic Democratic Peace in the Middle East | journal = International Journal of Conflict and Violence | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | url = http://web630.webbox239.server-home.org/earlyview/430.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151019000536/http://web630.webbox239.server-home.org/earlyview/430.pdf | archivedate = October 19, 2015 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanations==
These theories have traditionally been categorized into two groups: explanations that focus on democratic norms and explanations that focus on democratic
political structures {{Harvard citation|Gelpi|Griesdorf|2001}}, {{Harvard citation|Braumoeller|1997}}. Note that they usually are meant to be explanations for little violence between democracies, not for a low level of internal violence in democracies.

Several of these mechanisms may also apply to countries of similar systems. The book ''[[Never at War]]'' finds evidence for an oligarchic peace. One example is the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], in which the [[Sejm]] resisted and vetoed most royal proposals for war,&lt;ref&gt;For a description, see {{cite book|title=The northern wars: war, state and society in northeastern Europe, 1558–1721 |first=Robert I.|last=Frost|publisher=Longman's|location=Harlow, England; New York|isbn=0-582-06429-5}} 2000. Especially Pp. 9–11, 114, 181, 323.&lt;/ref&gt; like those of [[Władysław IV Vasa]].

===Democratic norms===
One example from the first group is that liberal democratic culture may make the leaders accustomed to negotiation and compromise {{Harvard citation|Weart|1998}}, (Müller &amp; Wolff 2004). Another that a belief in human rights may make people in democracies reluctant to go to war, especially against other democracies. The decline in colonialism, also by democracies, may be related to a change in perception of non-European peoples and their rights {{Harvard citation|Ravlo|Gleditsch|2000}}.

Bruce Russett (1993, p.&amp;nbsp;5–11, 35, 59–62, 73–4) also argues that the democratic culture affects the way leaders resolve conflicts. In addition, he holds that a social norm emerged toward the end of the nineteenth century; that democracies should not fight each other, which strengthened when the democratic culture and the degree of democracy increased, for example by widening the franchise. Increasing democratic stability allowed partners in foreign affairs to perceive a nation as reliably democratic. The alliances between democracies during the two World Wars and the Cold War also strengthened the norms. He sees less effective traces of this norm in Greek antiquity.

[[Hans Köchler]] (1995) relates the question of transnational democracy to empowering the individual citizen by involving him, through procedures of [[direct democracy]], in a country's international affairs, and he calls for the restructuring of the United Nations Organization according to democratic norms. He refers in particular to the Swiss practice of [[participatory democracy]].

Mousseau (2000, 2005) argues that it is market-oriented development that creates the norms and values that explain both democracy and the peace. In less developed countries individuals often depend on social networks that impose conformity to in-group norms and beliefs, and loyalty to group leaders. When jobs are plentiful on the market, in contrast, as in market-oriented developed countries, individuals depend on a strong state that enforces contracts equally. Cognitive routines emerge of abiding by state law rather than group leaders, and, as in contracts, tolerating differences among individuals. Voters in marketplace democracies thus accept only impartial ‘liberal’ governments, and constrain leaders to pursue their interests in securing equal access to global markets and in resisting those who distort such access with force. Marketplace democracies thus share common foreign policy interests in the supremacy—and predictability—of international law over brute power politics, and equal and open global trade over closed trade and imperial preferences. When disputes do originate between marketplace democracies, they are less likely than others to escalate to violence because both states, even the stronger one, perceive greater long-term interests in the supremacy of law over power politics.

{{Harvard citation|Braumoeller|1997}} argues that liberal norms of conflict resolution vary because liberalism takes many forms. By examining survey results from the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union, the author demonstrates that liberalism in that region bears a stronger resemblance to 19th-century liberal nationalism than to the sort of universalist, Wilsonian liberalism described by democratic peace theorists, and that, as a result, liberals in the region are ''more,'' not less, aggressive than non-liberals.

===Democratic political structures===
The case for institutional constraints goes back to Kant (1795), who wrote:
:"[I]f the consent of the citizens is required in order to decide that war should be declared (and in this constitution it cannot but be the case), nothing is more natural than that they would be very cautious in commencing such a poor game, decreeing for themselves all the calamities of war. Among the latter would be: having to fight, having to pay the costs of war from their own resources, having painfully to repair the devastation war leaves behind, and, to fill up the measure of evils, load themselves with a heavy national debt that would embitter peace itself and that can never be liquidated on account of constant wars in the future"

Democracy thus gives influence to those most likely to be killed or wounded in wars, and their relatives and friends (and to those who pay the bulk of the war taxes) Russett (1993, p.&amp;nbsp;30). This monadic theory must, however, explain why democracies do attack non-democratic states. One explanation is that these democracies were threatened or otherwise were provoked by the non-democratic states. Doyle (1997, p.&amp;nbsp;272) argued that the absence of a monadic peace is only to be expected: the same ideologies that cause liberal states to be at peace with each other inspire idealistic wars with the illiberal, whether to defend oppressed foreign minorities or avenge countrymen settled abroad. Doyle also notes (p.&amp;nbsp;292) liberal states do conduct covert operations against each other; the covert nature of the operation, however, prevents the publicity otherwise characteristic of a free state from applying to the question

Studies show that democratic states are more likely than autocratic states to win the wars. One explanation is that democracies, for internal political and economic reasons, have greater resources. This might mean that democratic leaders are unlikely to select other democratic states as targets because they perceive them to be particularly formidable opponents. One study finds that interstate wars have important impacts on the fate of political regimes, and that the probability that a political leader will fall from power in the wake of a lost war is particularly high in democratic states {{Harvard citation|Ray|1998}}.

As described in {{Harvard citation|Gelpi|Griesdorf|2001}}, several studies have argued that liberal leaders face institutionalized constraints that impede their capacity to mobilize the state’s resources for war without the consent of a broad spectrum of interests. Survey results that compare the attitudes of citizens and elites in the Soviet successor states are consistent with this argument {{Harvard citation|Braumoeller|1997}}. Moreover, these constraints are readily apparent to other states and cannot be manipulated by leaders. Thus, democracies send credible signals to other states of an aversion to using force. These signals allow democratic states to avoid conflicts with one another, but they may attract aggression from nondemocratic states. Democracies may be pressured to respond to such aggression—perhaps even preemptively—through the use of force. Also as described in {{Harvard citation|Gelpi|Griesdorf|2001}}, studies have argued that when democratic leaders do choose to escalate international crises, their threats are taken as highly credible, since there must be a relatively large public opinion for these actions. In disputes between liberal states, the credibility of their bargaining signals allows them to negotiate a peaceful settlement before mobilization.

An explanation based on [[game theory]] similar to the last two above is that the participation of the public and the open debate send clear and reliable information regarding the intentions of democracies to other states. In contrast, it is difficult to know the intentions of nondemocratic leaders, what effect concessions will have, and if promises will be kept. Thus there will be mistrust and unwillingness to make concessions if at least one of the parties in a dispute is a nondemocracy {{Harvard citation|Levy|Razin|2004}}.

The risk factors for certain types of state have, however, changed since Kant's time. In the quote above, Kant points to the lack of popular support for war – first that the populace will directly or indirectly suffer in the event of war – as a reason why republics will not tend to go to war. The number of American troops killed or maimed versus the number of Iraqi soldiers and civilians maimed and killed in the American-Iraqi conflict is indicative. This may explain the relatively great willingness of democratic states to attack weak opponents: the Iraq war was, initially at least, highly popular in the United States. The case of the [[Vietnam War]] might, nonetheless, indicate a tipping point where publics may no longer accept continuing attrition of their soldiers (even while remaining relatively indifferent to the much higher loss of life on the part of the populations attacked).

Coleman (2002) uses economic cost-benefit analysis to reach conclusions similar to Kant's. Coleman examines the polar cases of autocracy and liberal democracy. In both cases, the costs of war are assumed to be borne by the people. In autocracy, the autocrat receives the entire benefits of war, while in a liberal democracy the benefits are dispersed among the people. Since the net benefit to an autocrat exceeds the net benefit to a citizen of a liberal democracy, the autocrat is more likely to go to war. The disparity of benefits and costs can be so high that an autocrat can launch a welfare-destroying war when his net benefit exceeds the total cost of war. Contrarily, the net benefit of the same war to an individual in a liberal democracy can be negative so that he would not choose to go to war. This disincentive to war is increased between liberal democracies through their establishment of linkages, political and economic, that further raise the costs of war between them. Therefore, liberal democracies are less likely to go war, especially against each other. Coleman further distinguishes between offensive and defensive wars and finds that liberal democracies are less likely to fight defensive wars that may have already begun due to excessive discounting of future costs.

==Criticism==
There are several logically distinguishable classes of criticism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Note that they usually apply to no wars or few MIDs between democracies, not to little systematic violence in established democracies. (But see [[List of wars between democracies]].)

===Statistical significance===
One study {{Harvard citation|Schwartz|Skinner|2002}} has argued that there have been as many wars between democracies as one would expect between any other couple of states. However, its authors include wars between young and dubious democracies, and very small wars.

Others {{Harvard citation|Spiro|1994}}, {{Harvard citation|Gowa|1999}}, {{Harvard citation|Small|Singer|1976}} state that, although there may be some evidence for democratic peace, the data sample or the time span may be too small to assess any definitive conclusions. For example, Gowa finds evidence for democratic peace to be insignificant before 1939, because of the too small number of democracies, and offers an alternate explanation for the following period (see the section on [[Democratic peace theory#Realist explanations|Realist Explanations]]). Gowa's use of statistics has been criticized, with several other studies and reviews finding different or opposing results {{Harvard citation|Gelpi|Griesdorf|2001}}, {{Harvard citation|Ray|2003}}. However, this can be seen as the longest-lasting criticism to the theory; as noted earlier, also some supporters {{Harvard citation|Wayman|1998}} agree that the statistical sample for assessing its validity is limited or scarce, at least if only full-scale wars are considered.

According to one study, {{Harvard citation|Ray|2003}} which uses a rather restrictive definition of democracy and war, there were no wars between jointly democratic couples of states in the period from 1816 to 1992. Assuming a purely random distribution of wars between states, regardless of their democratic character, the predicted number of conflicts between democracies would be around ten. So, Ray argues that the evidence is statistically significant, but that it is still conceivable that, in the future, even a small number of inter-democratic wars would cancel out such evidence.&lt;ref&gt;The 1999 [[Kargil War]], subsequent to the period considered, does satisfy the objective requirements for democracy and war set in Ray's study.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace comes before democracy===
Douglas M. Gibler and Andrew Owsiak in their study argued peace almost always comes before democracy and that states do not develop democracy until all border disputes have been settled. These studies indicate that there is strong evidence that peace causes democracy but little evidence that democracy causes peace.&lt;ref&gt;Gibler and Owsiak (2017)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Azar Gat]] (2017) argues that it is not democracy in itself that leads to peace but other aspects of modernization, such as economic prosperity and lower population growth.

The hypothesis that peace causes democracy is supported by psychological and cultural theories. [[Christian Welzel|Christian Welzel's]] [[Freedom Rising|human empowerment theory]] posits that existential security leads to emancipative cultural values and support for a democratic political organization.&lt;ref&gt;Welzel 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This is in agreement with theories based on [[evolutionary psychology]].

===Wars against non-democracies===
Several studies fail to confirm that democracies are less likely to wage war than autocracies if wars against non-democracies are included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cashman |first1=Greg |title=What Causes War?: An Introduction to Theories of International Conflict |date=2013 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |edition= 2nd |chapter=Chapt. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definitions, methodology and data===
Some authors criticize the definition of democracy by arguing that states continually reinterpret other states' regime types as a consequence of their own objective interests and motives, such as economic and security concerns {{Harvard citation|Rosato|2003}}. For example, one study {{Harvard citation|Oren|1995}} reports that Germany was considered a democratic state by Western opinion leaders at the end of the 19th century; yet in the years preceding World War I, when its relations with the United States, France and Britain started deteriorating, Germany was gradually reinterpreted as an autocratic state, in absence of any actual regime change. Shimmin {{Harvard citation|Shimmin|1999}} moves a similar criticism regarding the western perception of Milosevic's Serbia between 1989 and 1999. Rummel {{Harvard citation|Rummel|1999}} replies to this criticism by stating that, in general, studies on democratic peace do not focus on other countries' perceptions of democracy; and in the specific case of Serbia, by arguing that the limited credit accorded by western democracies to Milosevic in the early '90s did not amount to a recognition of democracy, but only to the perception that possible alternative leaders could be even worse.

Some democratic peace researchers have been criticized for ''post hoc'' reclassifying some specific conflicts as non-wars or political systems as non-democracies without checking and correcting the whole data set used similarly. Supporters and opponents of the democratic peace agree that this is bad use of statistics, even if a plausible case can be made for the correction (Bremer 1992), (Gleditsch 1995), (Gowa 1999). A military affairs columnist of the newspaper ''Asia Times'' has summarized the above criticism in a journalist's fashion describing the theory as subject to the [[no true Scotsman]] problem: exceptions are explained away as not being between "real" democracies or "real" wars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/HA31Ak01.html No true Scotsman fights a war] ''Asia Times'' 31 January 2006, by their military affairs columnist&lt;/ref&gt;

Some democratic peace researchers require that the executive result from a substantively contested election. This may be a restrictive definition: For example, the National Archives of the United States notes that "For all intents and purposes, [[George Washington]] was unopposed for election as President, both in 1789 and 1792". (Under the original provisions for the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], there was no distinction between votes for President and Vice-President: each elector was required to vote for two distinct candidates, with the runner-up to be Vice-President. Every elector cast one of his votes for Washington,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/scores.html#1789%5D,|title=U. S. Electoral College: Historical Election Results 1789-1996|author=|date=|website=www.archives.gov|accessdate=May 4, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720012240/https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/scores.html#1789%5D,|archivedate=July 20, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Adams received a majority of the other votes; there were several other candidates: so the election for Vice President was contested.)

Spiro (1994) made several other criticisms of the statistical methods used. Russett (1995) and a series of papers described by Ray (2003) responded to this, for example with different methodology.

Sometimes the datasets used have also been criticized. For example, some authors have criticized the Correlates of War data for not including civilian deaths in the battle deaths count, especially in civil wars {{Harvard citation|Sambanis|2001}}. Weeks and Cohen (2006) argue that most fishing disputes, which include no deaths and generally very limited threats of violence, should be excluded even from the list of military disputes. Gleditsch (2004) made several criticisms to the Correlates of War data set, and produced a revised set of data. Maoz and Russett (1993) made several criticisms to the Polity I and II data sets, which have mostly been addressed in later versions. These criticisms are generally considered minor issues.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

The most comprehensive critique points out that "democracy" is rarely defined, never refers to substantive democracy, is unclear about causation, has been refuted in more than 100 studies, fails to account for some 200 deviant cases, and has been promoted ideologically to justify one country seeking to expand democracy abroad (Haas 2014). Most studies treat the complex concept of "democracy" is a bivariate variable rather than attempting to dimensionalize the concept. Studies also fail to take into account the fact that there are dozens of types of democracy, so the results are meaningless unless articulated to a particular type of democracy or claimed to be true for all types, such as consociational or economic democracy, with disparate datasets.

===Limited consequences===
The peacefulness may have various limitations and qualifiers and may not actually mean very much in the real world.

Democratic peace researchers do in general not count as wars conflicts which do not kill a thousand on the battlefield; thus they exclude for example the bloodless [[Cod Wars]]. However, as noted earlier, research has also found a peacefulness between democracies when looking at lesser conflicts.

Democracies were involved in more colonial and imperialistic wars than other states during the 1816–1945 period. On the other hand, this relation disappears if controlling for factors like power and number of colonies. Liberal democracies have less of these wars than other states after 1945. This might be related to changes in the perception of non-European peoples, as embodied in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (Ravlo &amp; Glieditsch 2000).

Related to this is the human rights violations committed against [[Indigenous peoples|native people]], sometimes by liberal democracies. One response is that many of the worst crimes were committed by nondemocracies, like in the European colonies before the nineteenth century, in King [[Leopold II of Belgium]]'s privately owned [[Congo Free State]], and in [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Soviet Union]]. The United Kingdom abolished slavery in British territory in 1833, immediately after the [[Reform Act 1832]] had significantly enlarged the franchise. (Of course, the abolition of the slave trade had been enacted in 1807; and many DPT supporters would deny that the UK was a liberal democracy in 1833 when examining interstate wars.)

Hermann and Kegley (1995) argue that interventions between democracies are more likely to happen than projected by an expected model.&lt;ref name="Mar1995"&gt;{{cite journal

=== Historical periods ===
Economic historians Joel Mokyr and Hans-Joachim Voth argue that democratic states may have been more vulnerable to conquest because the rulers in those states were too heavily constrained. Absolutist rulers in other states could however operate more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-economic-history-of-modern-europe/understanding-growth-in-europe-17001870-theory-and-evidence/1F7DC52A53788F2F1F9C6615629363D9|title=Understanding growth in Europe, 1700–1870: theory and evidence (Chapter 1) - The Cambridge Economic History of Modern Europe|last=|first=|date=|website=Cambridge Core|pages=25–26|language=en|access-date=2018-02-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228041200/https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-economic-history-of-modern-europe/understanding-growth-in-europe-17001870-theory-and-evidence/1F7DC52A53788F2F1F9C6615629363D9|archivedate=February 28, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Imre Lakatos]] suggested that what he called a "progressive research program" is better than a "degenerative" one when it can explain the same phenomena as the "degenerative" one, but is also characterized by growth of its research field and the discovery of important novel facts. In contrast, the supporters of the "degenerative" program do not make important new empirical discoveries, but instead mostly apply adjustments to their theory in order to defend it from competitors. Some researchers argue that democratic peace theory is now the "progressive" program in international relations. According to these authors, the theory can explain the empirical phenomena previously explained by the earlier dominant research program, [[realism in international relations]]; in addition, the initial statement that democracies do not, or rarely, wage war on one another, has been followed by a rapidly growing literature on novel empirical regularities. {{Harvard citation|Ray|2003}}, {{Harvard citation|Chernoff|2004}}, {{Harvard citation|Harrison|2005}}.

Other examples are several studies finding that democracies are more likely to ally with one another than with other states, forming alliances which are likely to last longer than alliances involving nondemocracies {{Harvard citation|Ray|2003}}; several studies including {{Harvard citation|Weart|1998}} showing that democracies conduct diplomacy differently and in a more conciliatory way compared to nondemocracies; one study finding that democracies with [[proportional representation]] are in general more peaceful regardless of the nature of the other party involved in a relationship {{Harvard citation|Leblang|Chan|2003}}; and another study reporting that proportional representation system and decentralized territorial autonomy is positively associated with lasting peace in postconflict societies {{Harvard citation|Binningsbø|2005}}.

===Coup by provoking a war===

Many democracies become non-democratic by war, as being aggressed or as aggressor (quickly after a coup), sometimes the coup leader worked to provoke that war.

[https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Schmitt#Ch._1_:_Definition_of_Sovereignty Schmitt] (1922) wrote on how to overrule a Constitution: "Sovereign is he who decides on the exception."

[https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Schmitt#The_Concept_of_the_Political_.281927.29 Schmitt] (1927) again on the need for internal (and foreign) enemies because they are useful to persuade the people not to trust anyone more than the Leader: “As long as the state is a political entity this requirement for internal peace compels it in critical situations to decide also upon the domestic enemy. Every state provides, therefore, some kind of formula for the declaration of an internal enemy.” Whatever opposition will be pictured and intended as the actual foreign enemy's puppet.

==Other explanations==
{{Weasel|date=February 2014}}

===Political similarity===
One general criticism motivating research of different explanations is that actually the theory cannot claim that "democracy causes peace", because the evidence for democracies being, in general, more peaceful is very slight or non existent; it only can support the claim that "''joint'' democracy causes peace". According to Rosato (2003), this casts doubts on whether democracy is actually the cause because, if so, a monadic effect would be expected.

Perhaps the simplest explanation to such perceived anomaly (but not the one the Realist Rosato prefers, see the section on Realist explanations below) is that democracies are not peaceful to each other because they are democratic, but rather because they are ''similar''. This line of thought started with several independent observations of an "Autocratic Peace" effect, a reduced probability of war (obviously no author claims its absence) between states which are both non-democratic, or both highly so {{Harvard citation|Raknerud|Hegre|1997}}, {{Harvard citation|Beck|Jackman|1998}}, This has led to the hypothesis that democratic peace emerges as a particular case when analyzing a subset of states which are, in fact, similar {{Harvard citation|Werner|2000}}. Or, that similarity in general does not solely affect the probability of war, but only coherence of strong political regimes such as full democracies and stark autocracies.

Autocratic peace and the explanation based on political similarity is a relatively recent development, and opinions about its value are varied. Henderson (2002) builds a model considering political similarity, geographic distance and economic interdependence as its main variables, and concludes that democratic peace is a statistical artifact which disappears when the above variables are taken into account. Werner (2000) finds a conflict reducing effect from political similarity in general, but with democratic dyads being particularly peaceful, and noting some differences in behavior between democratic and autocratic dyads with respect to alliances and power evaluation. Beck, King and Zeng (2004) use neural networks to show two distinct low probability zones, corresponding to high democracy and high autocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Although not discussed in the text, the figure they show (Figure 2) suggests that the democratic peace is stronger.&lt;/ref&gt; Petersen (2004) uses a different statistical model and finds that autocratic peace is not statistically significant, and that the effect attributed to similarity is mostly driven by the pacifying effect of joint democracy. Ray (2005) similarly disputes the weight of the argument on logical grounds, claiming that statistical analysis on "political similarity" uses a main variable which is an extension of "joint democracy" by linguistic redefinition, and so it is expected that the war reducing effects are carried on in the new analysis. Bennett (2006) builds a direct statistical model based on a triadic classification of states into "democratic", "autocratic" and "mixed". He finds that autocratic dyads have a 35% reduced chance of going into any type of armed conflict with respect to a reference mixed dyad. Democratic dyads have a 55% reduced chance. This effect gets stronger when looking at more severe conflicts; for wars (more than 1000 battle deaths), he estimates democratic dyads to have an 82% lower risk than autocratic dyads. He concludes that autocratic peace exists, but democratic peace is clearly stronger. However, he finds no relevant pacifying effect of political similarity, except at the extremes of the scale.

To summarize a rather complex picture, there are no less than four possible stances on the value of this criticism:
#Political similarity, plus some complementary variables, explains everything. Democratic peace is a statistical artifact. Henderson subscribes to this view.
#Political similarity has a pacifying effect, but democracy makes it stronger. Werner would probably subscribe to this view.
#Political similarity in general has little or no effect, except at the extremes of the democracy-autocracy scale: a democratic peace and an autocratic peace exist separately, with the first one being stronger, and may have different explanations. Bennett holds this view, and Kinsella mentions this as a possibility
#Political similarity has little or no effect and there is no evidence for autocratic peace. Petersen and Ray are among defendants of this view.

===Economic factors===
{{Main|Capitalist peace}}
[[Image:World GDP Capita 1-2003 A.D.png|thumb|right|350px|World [[GDP]]/capita 1–2003 AD. The increase in the number of democratic nations has occurred at the same time as the increase in economic wealth.]]

The capitalist peace, or capitalist peace theory, posits that according to a given criteria for economic development (capitalism), developed economies have not engaged in war with each other, and rarely enter into low-level disputes. These theories have been proposed as an explanation for the democratic peace by accounting for both democracy and the peace among democratic nations. The exact nature of the causality depends upon both the proposed variable and the measure of the indicator for the concept used.

A majority of researchers on the determinants of democracy agree that economic development is a primary factor which allows the formation of a stable and healthy democracy (Hegre, 2003; Weede, 2004). Thus, some researchers have argued that economic development also plays a factor in the establishment of peace.

Mousseau argues that a culture of contracting in advanced market-oriented economies may cause both democracy and peace (2000; 2002; 2003; 2005). These studies indicate that democracy, alone, is an unlikely cause of the democratic peace. A low level of market-oriented economic development may hinder development of liberal institutions and values. Hegre (2000) and Souva (2003) confirmed these expectations. Mousseau (2005) finds that democracy is a significant factor only when both democracies have levels of economic development well above the global median. In fact, the poorest 21% of the democracies studied, and the poorest 4–5% of current democracies, are significantly ''more'' likely than other kinds of countries to fight each other. Mousseau, Hegre &amp; Oneal (2003) confirm that if at least one of the democracies involved has a very low level of economic development, democracy is ineffective in preventing war; however, they find that when also controlling for trade, 91% of all the democratic pairs had high enough development for the pacifying effect of democracy to be important during the 1885–1992 period and all in 1992. The difference in results of Mousseau (2005) and Mousseau, Hegre &amp; Oneal (2003) may be due to sampling: Mousseau (2005) observed only neighboring states where poor countries actually can fight each other. In fact, fully 89% of militarized conflicts between less developed countries from 1920 and 2000 were among directly contiguous neighbors (Mousseau 2005:68–69). He argues that it is not likely that the results can be explained by trade: Because developed states have large economies, they do not have high levels of trade interdependence (2005:70 and footnote 5; Mousseau, Hegre &amp; Oneal 2003:283). In fact, the correlation of developed democracy with trade interdependence is a scant 0.06 (Pearson's ''r'' – considered substantively no correlation by statisticians)(2005:77).

Both [[World War]]s were fought between countries which can be considered economically developed. Mousseau argues that both Germany and Japan – like the USSR during the Cold War and Saudi Arabia today – had state-managed economies and thus lacked his market norms (Mousseau 2002–03:29). Hegre (2003) finds that democracy is correlated with civil peace only for developed countries, and for countries with high levels of literacy. Conversely, the risk of civil war decreases with development only for democratic countries.

Gartzke (2005) argues that [[economic freedom]] (a quite different concept from Mousseau's market norms) or financial dependence (2007) explains the developed democratic peace, and these countries may be weak on these dimensions too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freetheworld.com/release.html|title=Economic Freedom of the World - Annual Report 2015 - www.freetheworld.com|first=Fraser|last=Institute|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904154024/http://www.freetheworld.com/release.html|archivedate=September 4, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rummel (2005) criticizes Gartzke's methodology and argues that his results are invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freedomspeace.blogspot.com//2005/10/cato-and-gartzke-are-at-it-again.html|title=freedomspeace|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919065517/http://freedomspeace.blogspot.com/2005/10/cato-and-gartzke-are-at-it-again.html|archivedate=September 19, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies find that democracy, more [[trade]] causing greater economic [[interdependence]], and membership in more [[intergovernmental organizations]] reduce the risk of war. This is often called the Kantian peace theory since it is similar to Kant's earlier theory about a perpetual peace; it is often also called "liberal peace" theory, especially when one focuses on the effects of trade and democracy. (The theory that [[free trade]] can cause peace is quite old and referred to as [[Cobdenism]].) Many researchers agree that these variables positively affect each other but each has a separate pacifying effect. For example, in countries exchanging a substantial amount of trade, economic interest groups may exist that oppose a reciprocal disruptive war, but in democracy such groups may have more power, and the political leaders be more likely to accept their requests. (Russett &amp; Oneal 2001), {{Harvard citation|Lagazio|Russett|2004}}, {{Harvard citation|Oneal|Russett|2004}}. Weede (2004) argues that the pacifying effect of free trade and economic interdependence may be more important than that of democracy, because the former affects peace both directly and indirectly, by producing economic development and ultimately, democracy. Weede also lists some other authors supporting this view. However, some recent studies find no effect from trade but only from democracy {{Harvard citation|Goenner|2004}}, {{Harvard citation|Kim|Rousseau|2005}}.

None of the authors listed argues that free trade alone causes peace. Even so, the issue of whether free trade or democracy is more important in maintaining peace may have potentially significant practical consequences, for example on evaluating the effectiveness of applying economic sanctions and restrictions to autocratic countries.

It was Michael Doyle (1983, 1997) who reintroduced Kant's three articles into democratic peace theory. He argued that a pacific union of liberal states has been growing for the past two centuries. He denies that a pair of states will be peaceful simply because they are both liberal democracies; if that were enough, liberal states would not be aggressive towards weak non-liberal states (as the history of American relations with Mexico shows they are). Rather, liberal democracy is a necessary condition for international organization and hospitality (which are Kant's other two articles)—and all three are sufficient to produce peace. Other Kantians have not repeated Doyle's argument that all three in the triad must be present, instead stating that all three reduce the risk of war.

[[Immanuel Wallerstein]] has argued that it is the global capitalist system that creates shared interests among the dominant parties, thus inhibiting potentially harmful belligerence.{{Harvard citation|Satana|2010|p=231}}

[[Toni Negri|Negri]] and [[Michael Hardt|Hardt]] take a similar stance, arguing that the intertwined network of interests in the global capitalism leads to the decline of individual [[Nation-state|nation states]], and the rise of a global [[Empire (Negri and Hardt book)|''Empire'']] which has no outside, and no external enemies. As a result, they write, "The era of imperialist, interimperialist, and anti-imperialist wars is over. (...) we have entered the era of minor and internal conflicts. Every imperial war is a civil war, a police action." (Hardt &amp; Negri 2000).

===Other explanations===
Many studies, as those discussed in {{Harvard citation|Ray|1998}}, {{Harvard citation|Ray|2005}}, {{Harvard citation|Oneal|Russett|2004}}, supporting the theory have controlled for many possible alternative causes of the peace. Examples of factors controlled for are geographic distance, geographic contiguity, power status, alliance ties, militarization, economic wealth and economic growth, power ratio, and political stability. These studies have often found very different results depending on methodology and included variables, which has caused criticism. It should be noted that DPT does not state democracy is the only thing affecting the risk of military conflict. Many of the mentioned studies have found that other factors are also important. However, a common thread in most results is an emphasis on the relationship between democracy and peace. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Several studies have also controlled for the possibility of reverse causality from peace to democracy. For example, one study {{Harvard citation|Reuveny|Li|2003}} supports the theory of simultaneous causation, finding that dyads involved in wars are likely to experience a decrease in joint democracy, which in turn increases the probability of further war. So they argue that disputes between democratizing or democratic states should be resolved externally at a very early stage, in order to stabilize the system. Another study {{Harvard citation|Reiter|2001}} finds that peace does not spread democracy, but spreading democracy is likely to spread peace. A different kind of reverse causation lies in the suggestion that impending war could destroy or decrease democracy, because the preparation for war might include political restrictions, which may be the cause for the findings of democratic peace. However, this hypothesis has been statistically tested in a study {{Harvard citation|Mousseau|Shi|1999}} whose authors find, depending on the definition of the pre-war period, no such effect or a very slight one. So, they find this explanation unlikely. Note also that this explanation would predict a monadic effect, although weaker than the dyadic one{{dubious|date=January 2016}}.

Weart (1998) argues that the peacefulness appears and disappears rapidly when democracy appears and disappears. This in his view makes it unlikely that variables that change more slowly are the explanation. Weart, however, has been criticized for not offering any quantitative analysis supporting his claims (Ray, 2000).

Wars tend very strongly to be between neighboring states. Gleditsch (1995) showed that the average distance between democracies is about 8000 miles, the same as the average distance between all states. He believes that the effect of distance in preventing war, modified by the democratic peace, explains the incidence of war as fully as it can be explained.

===Realist explanations===
Supporters of [[realism in international relations]] in general argue that not democracy or its absence, but considerations and evaluations of power, cause peace or war. Specifically, many realist critics claim that the effect ascribed to democratic, or liberal, peace, is in fact due to alliance ties between democratic states which in turn are caused, one way or another, by realist factors.

For example, Farber and Gowa (1995) find evidence for peace between democracies to be statistically significant only in the period from 1945 on, and consider such peace an artifact of the [[Cold War]], when the threat from the communist states forced democracies to ally with one another. Mearsheimer (1990) offers a similar analysis of the Anglo-American peace before 1945, caused by the German threat. Spiro (1994) finds several instances of wars between democracies, arguing that evidence in favor of the theory might be not so vast as other authors report, and claims that the remaining evidence consists of peace between allied states with shared objectives. He acknowledges that democratic states might have a somewhat greater tendency to ally with one another, and regards this as the only real effect of democratic peace. Rosato (2003) argues that most of the significant evidence for democratic peace has been observed after World War II; and that it has happened within a broad alliance, which can be identified with NATO and its satellite nations, imposed and maintained by American dominance (see [[Pax Americana]]). One of the main points in Rosato's argument is that, although never engaged in open war with another liberal democracy during the Cold War, the United States intervened openly or covertly in the political affairs of democratic states several times, for example in the [[Chilean coup of 1973]], the [[Operation Ajax|1953 coup in Iran]] and [[Operation PBSUCCESS|1954 coup in Guatemala]]; in Rosato's view, these interventions show the United States' determination to maintain an "imperial peace".

The most direct counter arguments to such criticisms have been studies finding peace between democracies to be significant even when controlling for "common interests" as reflected in alliance ties {{Harvard citation|Gelpi|Griesdorf|2001}}, {{Harvard citation|Ray|2003}}. Regarding specific issues, Ray (1998) objects that explanations based on the Cold War should predict that the Communist bloc would be at peace within itself also, but exceptions include the [[Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan]], the [[Cambodian-Vietnamese War]], and the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]]. Ray also argues that the external threat did not prevent conflicts in the Western bloc when at least one of the involved states was a nondemocracy, such as the [[Turkish Invasion of Cyprus]] (against Greek Junta supported Cypriot Greeks), the [[Falklands War]], and the [[Football War]]. Also, one study {{Harvard citation|Ravlo|Gleditsch|2000}} notes that the explanation "goes increasingly stale as the post-Cold War world accumulates an increasing number of peaceful dyad-years between democracies". Rosato's argument about American dominance has also been criticized for not giving supporting statistical evidence (Slantchev, Alexandrova &amp; Gartzke 2005).

Some realist authors also criticize in detail the explanations first by supporters of democratic peace, pointing to supposed inconsistencies or weaknesses.

Rosato (2003) criticizes most explanations to how democracy might cause peace. Arguments based on normative constraints, he argues, are not consistent with the fact that democracies do go to war no less than other states, thus violating norms preventing war; for the same reason he refutes arguments based on the importance of public opinion. Regarding explanations based on greater accountability of leaders, he finds that historically autocratic leaders have been removed or punished more often than democratic leaders when they get involved in costly wars. Finally, he also criticizes the arguments that democracies treat each other with trust and respect even during crises; and that democracy might be slow to mobilize its composite and diverse groups and opinions, hindering the start of a war, drawing support from other authors. Another realist, Layne (1994), analyzes the crises and [[brinkmanship]] that took place between non-allied democratic great powers, during the relatively brief period when such existed. He finds no evidence either of institutional or cultural constraints against war; indeed, there was popular sentiment in favor of war on both sides. Instead, in all cases, one side concluded that it could not afford to risk that war at that time, and made the necessary concessions.

Rosato's objections have been criticized for claimed logical and methodological errors, and for being contradicted by existing statistical research (Kinsella 2005). Russett (1995) replies to Layne by re-examining some of the crises studied in his article, and reaching different conclusions; Russett argues that perceptions of democracy prevented escalation, or played a major role in doing so. Also, a recent study (Gelpi &amp; Griesdorf 2001) finds that, while in general the outcome of international disputes is highly influenced by the contenders' relative military strength, this is not true if both contenders are democratic states; in this case the authors find the outcome of the crisis to be independent of the military capabilities of contenders, which is contrary to realist expectations. Finally, both the realist criticisms here described ignore new possible explanations, like the game-theoretic one discussed below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poli.vub.ac.be/publi/orderbooks/myth/03Risse.pdf|title=Democratic Peace – Warlike Democracies?

===Nuclear deterrent===
A different kind of realist criticism (see {{Harvard citation|Jervis|2002}} for a discussion) stresses the role of nuclear weapons in maintaining peace. In realist terms, this means that, in the case of disputes between nuclear powers, respective evaluation of power might be irrelevant because of [[Mutual assured destruction]] preventing both sides from foreseeing what could be reasonably called a "victory". The 1999 [[Kargil War]] between India and Pakistan has been cited as a counterexample to this argument (Page Fortna, 2004).

Some supporters of the democratic peace do not deny that realist factors are also important (Russett 1995). Research supporting the theory has also shown that factors such as alliance ties and major power status influence interstate conflict behavior {{Harvard citation|Ray|2003}}.

==Influence==
The democratic peace theory has been extremely divisive among [[political scientists]]. It is rooted in the [[Idealism (international relations)|idealist]] and [[classical liberalism|classical liberalist]] traditions and is opposed to the previously dominant theory of [[Realism (international relations)|realism]]. However, democratic peace theory has come to be more widely accepted and has in some democracies effected policy change. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

In the United States, presidents from both major parties have expressed support for the theory. In his 1994 [[State of the Union]] address, then-President [[Bill Clinton]], a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], said: "Ultimately, the best strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to support the advance of democracy elsewhere. Democracies don't attack each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Clinton |first=Bill |title=1994 State Of The Union Address |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/states/docs/sou94.htm |accessdate=January 22, 2006 |work=The Washington Post |date=2000-01-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000816174749/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/states/docs/sou94.htm |archivedate=August 16, 2000 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2004 press conference, then-President [[George W.

===As justification for initiating war===
Some fear that the democratic peace theory may be used to justify wars against nondemocracies in order to bring lasting peace, in a ''democratic crusade'' (Chan 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;59). [[Woodrow Wilson]] in 1917 asked Congress to declare war against Imperial Germany, citing Germany's sinking of American ships due to [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] and the [[Zimmermann telegram]], but also stating that "A steadfast concert for peace can never be maintained except by a partnership of democratic nations" and "The world must be made safe for democracy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/4943/ Wilson, T. Woodrow: ''Message to Congress'' April 2, 1917] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222004846/http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/4943 |date=February 22, 2006 }} Wilson's vision for the world after [[World War I]], his [[Fourteen Points]](1918), did not mention democracy, but in other aspects "sound almost as though Kant were guiding Wilson's writing hand." They included both Kant’s [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] law and pacific union. The third of the [[Fourteen Points]] specified the removal of economic barriers between peaceful nations; the fourteenth provided for the [[League of Nations]] (Russett 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; [[R. J. Rummel]] is a notable proponent of war for the purpose of spreading democracy, based on this theory.

Some point out that the democratic peace theory has been used to justify the [[2003 Iraq War]], others argue that this justification was used only after the war had already started (Russett 2005). Furthermore, Weede (2004) has argued that the justification is extremely weak, because forcibly democratizing a country completely surrounded by non-democracies, most of which are full autocracies, as Iraq was, is at least as likely to increase the risk of war as it is to decrease it (some studies show that dyads formed by one democracy and one autocracy are the most warlike, and several find that the risk of war is greatly increased in democratizing countries surrounded by nondemocracies).{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} According to Weede, if the United States and its allies wanted to adopt a rationale strategy of forced democratization based on democratic peace, which he still does not recommend, it would be best to start intervening in countries which border with at least one or two stable democracies, and expand gradually. Also, research shows that attempts to create democracies by using external force has often failed. Gleditsch, Christiansen and Hegre (2004) argue that forced democratization by interventionism may initially have partial success, but often create an unstable democratizing country, which can have dangerous consequences in the long run. Those attempts which had a permanent and stable success, like democratization in [[Allied-occupied Austria|Austria]], [[Bizone|West Germany]] and [[Occupied Japan|Japan]] after [[World War II]], mostly involved countries which had an advanced economic and social structure already, and implied a drastic change of the whole political culture. Supporting internal democratic movements and using diplomacy may be far more successful and less costly. Thus, the theory and related research, if they were correctly understood, may actually be an argument against a democratic crusade (Weart 1998), (Owen 2005), (Russett 2005).

[[Michael Haas (political scientist)|Michael Haas]] has written perhaps the most trenchant critique of a hidden normative agenda (Haas 1997). Among the points raised: Due to sampling manipulation, the research creates the impression that democracies can justifiably fight nondemocracies, snuff out budding democracies, or even impose democracy. And due to sloppy definitions, there is no concern that democracies continue undemocratic practices yet remain in the sample as if pristine democracies.

This criticism is confirmed by [[David Keen]](2006) who finds that almost all historical attempts to impose democracy by violent means have failed.

===Other factors related to democracies being more peaceful===
{{Prose|section|date=April 2012}}
According to Azar Gat's ''War in Human Civilization'', there are several related and independent factors that contribute to democratic societies being more peaceful than other forms of governments:&lt;ref&gt;Gat, Azar. "War in Human Civilization" New York: Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Wealth and comfort: Increased prosperity in democratic societies has been associated with peace because civilians are less willing to endure hardship of war and military service due to a more luxurious life at home than in pre-modern times. Increased wealth has worked to decrease war through comfort (Gat, 597–598).
#Metropolitan service society: The majority of army recruits come from the country side or factory workers. Many believe that these types of people are suited for war. But as technology progressed the army turned more towards advanced services in information that rely more on computerized data which urbanized people are recruited more for this service (Gat 600–602).
#Sexual revolution: The availability of sex due to the pill and women joining the labor market could be another factor that has led to less enthusiasm for men to go to war. Young men are more reluctant leave behind the pleasures of life for the rigors and chastity of the army (Gat 603- 604).
#Fewer young males: There is greater life expectancy which leads to fewer young males. Young males are the most aggressive and the ones that join the army the most. With fewer younger males in developed societies could help explain more pacificity (Gat 604–605).
#Fewer Children per Family (lower [[fertility rate]]): During pre modern times it was always hard for families to lose a child but in modern times it has become more difficult due to more families having only one or two children. It has become even harder for parents to risk the loss of a child in war. However, Gat recognizes that this argument is a difficult one because during pre modern times the life expectancy was not high for children and bigger families were necessary(Gat 605–606).
#Women's franchise: Women are less overtly aggressive than men. Therefore, women are less inclined to serious violence and do not support it as much as men do. In liberal democracies women have been able to influence the government by getting elected. Electing more women could have an effect on whether liberal democracies take a more aggressive approach on certain issues (Gat 606- 607).
#Nuclear weapons: Nuclear weapons could be the reason for not having a great power war. Many believe that a nuclear war would result in [[mutually assured destruction]] (MAD) which means that both countries involved in a nuclear war have the ability to strike the other until both sides are wiped out. This results in countries not wanting to strike the other for fear of being wiped out (608–609).

=== The European peace ===
There is significant debate over whether the lack of any major European [[general war]]s since 1945, is due to cooperation and integration of liberal-democratic European states themselves (as in the [[European Union]] or [[Franco-German cooperation]]), an enforced peace due to intervention of the Soviet Union and the United States until 1989 and the United States alone thereafter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mearsheimer.uchicago.edu/pdfs/A0055.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303115533/http://mearsheimer.uchicago.edu/pdfs/A0055.pdf |archivedate=March 3, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or a combination of both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nato.int/acad/fellow/00-02/Lucarelli%27s.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626162343/http://www.nato.int/acad/fellow/00-02/Lucarelli's.pdf |archivedate=June 26, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate over this theory was thrust in the public eye, when the [[2012 Nobel Peace Prize]] was awarded to the European Union, for its role in creating peace in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/why-nato-should-have-won-the-nobel-7594|title=Why NATO Should Have Won the Nobel|first=James|last=Joyner|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017114332/http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/why-nato-should-have-won-the-nobel-7594|archivedate=October 17, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1493">In mathematics, given a ''G''-[[torsor]] ''X'' → ''Y'' and a [[stack (mathematics)|stack]] ''F'', the '''descent along torsors''' says there is a canonical equivalence between ''F''(''Y''), the category of ''Y''-points and ''F''(''X'')&lt;sup&gt;''G''&lt;/sup&gt;, the category of ''G''-equivariant ''X''-points.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vistoli|loc=Theorem 4.46}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a basic example of [[descent (mathematics)|descent]], since it says the "equivariant data" (which is an additional data) allows one to "descend" from ''X'' to ''Y''.

When ''G'' is the [[Galois group]] of a finite [[Galois extension]] ''L''/''K'', for the ''G''-torsor &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec} L \to \operatorname{Spec} K&lt;/math&gt;, this generalizes classical '''Galois descent''' (cf. [[field of definition]]).

For example, one can take ''F'' to be the stack of quasi-coherent sheaves (in an appropriate topology). Then ''F''(''X'')&lt;sup&gt;''G''&lt;/sup&gt; consists of [[equivariant sheaf|equivariant sheaves]] on ''X''; thus, the descent in this case says that to give an equivariant sheaf on ''X'' is to give a sheaf on the quotient ''X''/''G''.

A '''dilemma''' ({{lang-grc-gre|δίλημμα}} "double [[lemma (logic)|proposition]]") is a [[problem]] offering two possibilities, neither of which is unambiguously acceptable or preferable. The possibilities are termed the ''horns'' of the dilemma, a [[cliché]]d usage, but distinguishing the dilemma from other kinds of predicament as a matter of usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garner |first1=Bryan |title=Garner's Modern American Usage |date=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199888771 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FwmQpyibKkAC&amp;pg=PA257 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dilemmatic arguments==
The dilemma is sometimes used as a [[rhetorical device]]. Its isolation as textbook material has been attributed to [[Hermogenes of Tarsus]] in his work ''On Invention''.&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Calboli Montefusco, ''Rhetorical use of dilemmatic arguments'', Rhetorica: A Journal of the History of Rhetoric Vol. 28, No. 4 (Autumn 2010), pp. 363–383, at p. 364. Published by: University of California Press on behalf of the International Society for the History of Rhetoric. DOI: 10.1525/rh.2010.28.4.363 {{jstor|10.1525/rh.2010.28.4.363}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. S. Peirce]] gave a definition of ''dilemmatic argument'' as any argument relying on [[excluded middle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ghosh |first1=Sujata |last2=Prasad |first2=Sanjiva |title=Logic and Its Applications: 7th Indian Conference, ICLA 2017, Kanpur, India, January 5-7, 2017, Proceedings |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783662540695 |page=177 note 5|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=etrJDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA177 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the form "you must accept either A, or B"; here A and B would be propositions each leading to some further conclusion, and applied incorrectly, it constitutes a [[false dichotomy]], that is, a [[fallacy]]. Traditional usage distinguished the dilemma as a "horned syllogism" from the [[sophism]] that attracted the Latin name ''cornutus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hamilton |first1=Sir William |title=The Logic of Sir William Hamilton, Bart |date=1863 |publisher=Moore, Wilstach &amp; Baldwin |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rUEdAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA185 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original use of the word ''horns'' in English has been attributed to [[Nicholas Udall]] in his 1548 book ''Paraphrases'', translating from the Latin term ''cornuta interrogatio''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erasmus |first1=Desiderius |title=Paraphrase on Luke 11-24 |date=2003 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=9780802036537 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q9ZLk_Qw0ZQC&amp;pg=PA158 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In logic==
In [[propositional logic]], ''dilemma'' is applied to a group of [[rules of inference]], which are in themselves valid rather than fallacious. They each have three premises, and include the [[constructive dilemma]] and [[destructive dilemma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Church |first1=Alonzo |title=Introduction to Mathematical Logic |date=1996 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0691029067 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JDLQOMKbdScC&amp;pg=PA105 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such arguments can be refuted by showing that the disjunctive premise — the "horns of the dilemma" — does not in fact hold, because it presents a false dichotomy. You are asked to accept "A or B", but counter by showing that is not all. Successfully undermining that premise is called "escaping through the horns of the dilemma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Govier |first1=Trudy |title=A Practical Study of Argument |date=2009 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=0495603406 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IUxXbUvDiswC&amp;pg=PA254 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==
Dilemmatic reasoning has been attributed to [[Melissus of Samos]], a [[Presocratic]] philosopher whose works survive in fragmentary form, making the origins of the technique in philosophy imponderable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harriman |first1=Benjamin |title=Melissus and Eleatic Monism |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781108416337 |page=44 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e091DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established with [[Diodorus Cronus]] (died c. 284 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sedley |first1=David |title=Diodorus Cronus |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/diodorus-cronus |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paradoxes of [[Zeno of Elea]] were reported by [[Aristotle]] in dilemma form, but that may have been to conform with what [[Plato]] said about Zeno's style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Palmer |first1=John |title=Zeno of Elea |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zeno-elea/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral and ethical dilemmas==
{{main|ethical dilemma}}
In cases where two [[moral principle]]s appear to be inconsistent, an actor has a dilemma in terms of which principle to follow. This kind of moral case study is attributed to [[Cicero]], in book III of his ''[[De Officiis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jonsen |first1=Albert R. |last2=Toulmin |first2=Stephen Edelston |title=The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning |date=1988 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520060630 |page=75 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RNipCKHdnlsC&amp;pg=PA75 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Christian tradition of [[casuistry]], an approach to abstract ranking of principles introduced by [[Bartolomé de Medina (theologian)|Bartolomé de Medina]] in the 16th century became tainted with the accusation of [[laxism]], as did casuistry itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Peters |first1=Francis E. |title=The words and will of God |date=2003 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0691114617 |page=154 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=26aSVSICGIEC&amp;pg=PA154 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach, with legal roots, is to lay emphasis on particular features present in a given case: in other words, the exact framing of the dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jonsen |first1=Albert R. |last2=Toulmin |first2=Stephen Edelston |title=The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning |date=1988 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520060630 |page=54 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RNipCKHdnlsC&amp;pg=PA54 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2087">In [[mathematics]], a '''semigroup with no elements''' (the '''empty semigroup''') is a [[semigroup]] in which the [[underlying set]] is the [[empty set]]. Many authors do not admit the existence of such a semigroup. For them a semigroup is by definition a ''non-empty'' set together with an associative binary operation.&lt;ref&gt;A H Clifford, G B Preston (1964). ''The Algebraic Theory of Semigroups Vol. I'' (Second Edition). [[American Mathematical Society]].  {{ISBN|978-0-8218-0272-4}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=J M Howie|title=An Introduction to Semigroup Theory|publisher=Academic Press|date=1976|series=L.M.S.Monographs|volume=7}} pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; However not all authors insist on the underlying set of a semigroup being non-empty.&lt;ref&gt;P A Grillet (1995). ''Semigroups''. [[CRC Press]].  {{ISBN|978-0-8247-9662-4}} pp. 3–4 &lt;/ref&gt;  One can logically define a semigroup in which the underlying set ''S'' is empty. The binary operation in the semigroup is the [[empty function]] from {{nowrap|''S'' × ''S''}} to ''S''. This operation [[vacuously]] satisfies the closure and associativity axioms of a semigroup. Not excluding the empty semigroup simplifies certain results on semigroups. For example, the result that the intersection of two subsemigroups of a semigroup ''T'' is a subsemigroup of ''T'' becomes valid even when the intersection is empty. 

When a semigroup is defined to have additional structure, the issue may not arise.  For example, the definition of a [[monoid]] requires an [[identity element]], which rules out the empty semigroup as a monoid.

In [[category theory]], the empty semigroup is always admitted.  It is the unique [[initial object]] of the category of semigroups.

A semigroup with no element is an [[inverse semigroup]], since the necessary condition is vacuously satisfied.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5373">In [[abstract algebra]], an '''epigroup''' is a [[semigroup]] in which every element has a power that belongs to a [[subgroup]]. Formally, for all ''x'' in a semigroup ''S'', there exists a [[positive integer]] ''n'' and a [[subgroup]] ''G'' of ''S'' such that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' &lt;/sup&gt; belongs to&amp;nbsp;''G''.

Epigroups are known by wide variety of other names, including '''quasi-periodic semigroup''', '''group-bound semigroup''', completely π-regular semigroup, '''strongly π-regular semigroup''' ('''sπr'''&lt;ref name="Renner2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lex E.

Kelarev, ''Applications of epigroups to graded ring theory'', [[Semigroup Forum]], Volume 50, Number 1 (1995), 327–350 {{doi|10.1007/BF02573530}}&lt;/ref&gt; or just '''π-regular semigroup'''&lt;ref name="JespersOkninski2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric Jespers|author2=Jan Okninski|title=Noetherian Semigroup Algebras|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qzj3MkWnCLQC&amp;pg=PA16|year=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-5809-7|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although the latter is ambiguous).&lt;!--I've bolded those which seem most common--&gt;

More generally, in an arbitrary semigroup an element is called ''group-bound'' if it has a power that belongs to a subgroup.

Epigroups have applications to [[ring theory]]. Many of their properties are studied in this context.&lt;ref name="Kelarev2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrei V. Kelarev|title=Ring Constructions and Applications|year=2002|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-02-4745-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epigroups were first studied by [[Douglas Munn]] in 1961, who called them ''pseudoinvertible''.&lt;ref name="MikhalevPilz2002"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Aleksandr Vasilʹevich Mikhalev and Günter Pilz|title=The Concise Handbook of Algebra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i2g2cstPDfEC&amp;pg=PA24|year=2002|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-7072-7|pages=23–26|author=Lev N. Shevrin|chapter=Epigroups}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
* Epigroups are a generalization of [[periodic semigroup]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter M. Higgins|title=Techniques of semigroup theory|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-853577-5|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus all [[finite semigroup]]s are also epigroups.
* The class of epigroups also contains all [[completely regular semigroup]]s and all [[completely 0-simple semigroups]].&lt;ref name="MikhalevPilz2002"/&gt;
* All epigroups are also [[eventually regular semigroup]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter M. Higgins|title=Techniques of semigroup theory|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-853577-5|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (also known as π-regular semigroups)
* A [[cancellative semigroup|cancellative]] epigroup is a [[group (mathematics)|group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter M. Higgins|title=Techniques of semigroup theory|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-853577-5|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Green's relations]] ''D'' and ''J'' coincide for any epigroup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter M. Higgins|title=Techniques of semigroup theory|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-853577-5|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* If ''S'' is an epigroup, any [[regular semigroup|regular]] subsemigroup of ''S'' is also an epigroup.&lt;ref name="Renner2005"/&gt;
* In an epigroup the [[Nambooripad order]] (as extended by P.R. Jones) and the [[natural partial order]] (of Mitsch) coincide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter M. Higgins|title=Techniques of semigroup theory|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-853577-5|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
* The semigroup of all matrices over a [[division ring]] is an epigroup.&lt;ref name="MikhalevPilz2002"/&gt;
* The multiplicative semigroup of every [[semisimple Artinian ring]] is an epigroup.&lt;ref name="Kelarev2002"/&gt;{{rp|5}}
* Any [[algebraic semigroup]] is an epigroup.

== Structure ==
By analogy with periodic semigroups, an epigroup ''S'' is [[Partition of a set|partitioned]] in classes given by its [[idempotent]]s, which act as identities for each subgroup. For each idempotent ''e'' of ''S'', the set: &lt;math&gt; K_e= \{ x \in S\;|\; \exists n&gt;0:\; x^n \in G_e \} &lt;/math&gt; is called a ''unipotency class'' (whereas for periodic semigroups the usual name is torsion class.)&lt;ref name="MikhalevPilz2002"/&gt;

Subsemigroups of an epigroup need not be epigroups, but if they are, then they are called subepigroups. If an epigroup ''S'' has a partition in unipotent subepigroups (i.e. each containing a single idempotent), then this partition is unique, and its components are precisely the unipotency classes defined above; such an epigroup is called ''unipotently partionable''. However, not every epigroup has this property. A simple counterexample is the [[Brandt semigroup]] with five elements ''B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' because the unipotency class of its zero element is not a subsemigroup. ''B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is actually the quintessential epigroup which is not unipotently partionable. An epigroup is unipotently partionable [[iff]] it contains no subsemigroup that is an [[ideal extension]] of an unipotent epigroup by ''B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''.&lt;ref name="MikhalevPilz2002"/&gt;

'''Foot roasting''' is a method of [[torture]] used since ancient times. The torture takes ingenious advantage of the extreme sensitivity of the sole of the foot to heat&lt;ref&gt;Schlee, G., ''et al.'', Foot sole skin temperature affects plantar foot sensitivity, ''Clinical Neurophysiology'' 120(8), August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The [[Romans]] immobilized the prisoner and pressed red-hot iron plates to the soles of his feet. The [[Spanish Inquisition]] bound the prisoner face-upward to the rack with his bare feet secured in a [[stocks]]. The soles of the feet were basted with [[lard]] or oil and slowly barbecued over a [[brazier]] of burning coals. A screen could be interposed between the feet and the coals to modulate the exposure, while a [[bellows]] controlled the intensity of the flame. Variants included placing slivers of hot coals between the toes, or suspending the prisoner head-downward and placing hot coals directly on the soles. The destruction of the Order of the [[Knights Templars]] is credited to these tortures, which were of sufficient cruelty literally to drive their sufferers insane&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, John J.  ''Dungeon, Fire and Sword: The Knights Templars in the Crusades'', Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Foot roasting remains a popular technique of torture to this day.  During the Cold War, KGB torturers made use of metal [[clothes irons]] heated red-hot and applied directly to the naked soles or explored the delicate webbing between the prisoner's toes using either a [[soldering iron]] or an electric wood-burning pencil&lt;ref&gt;John Barron, ''KGB'' , New York: Bantam, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Knights Templar ==
Foot roasting was one of the principal tortures used to extract supposed confessions of [[heresy]] and other accusations made against the [[Knights Templar]] after their arrest in October 1307. It is recorded that one Templar's feet were so savagely tortured that—as he was being carried back to his cell—various pieces of charred bone fell from his feet to the floor. Prisoners could also be suspended head-downwards from stocks, with hot coals placed directly on the soles of the feet&amp;mdash;held in place by gravity&amp;mdash;while thin slivers of burning embers were slid between pairs of adjacent toes.

== Brittany ==
In [[Brittany]], an enhanced interrogation chair was used&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Abbott, ''Rack, Rope, and Red-Hot Pincers'', London: Trafalgar Square Publishing, 1993, pp. 106-107.&lt;/ref&gt; that immobilized the feet and provided a movable tray of coals that could be cranked up and down, eventually making physical contact with the soles of the feet.

== Star kicking ==
A form of torture called "star kicking" supposedly began with [[Countess Elizabeth Bathory]], who would place oiled bits of paper or string between the prisoner's toes and light the material on fire.&lt;ref&gt;Kimberly L. Craft, ''Infamous Lady: The True Story of Countess Erzsebet Bathory'', North Charleston, SC: CreateSpace Independent Publishing, 2002, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Frenemy'''" (less commonly spelled "'''frienemy'''") is an [[oxymoron]] and a [[portmanteau]] of "[[friendship|friend]]" and "[[enemy]]" that refers to "a person with whom one is friendly, despite a fundamental dislike or rivalry" or "a person who combines the characteristics of a friend and an enemy".&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;"frenemy, n."&amp;nbsp;''OED Online''. Oxford University Press, December 2016. Web. 26 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used to describe personal, geopolitical and commercial relationships both among individuals and groups or institutions. The word has appeared in print as early as 1953 in an article titled "Howz about calling the Russians our Frienemies?" by the American gossip columnist [[Walter Winchel]] in the [[Nevada State Journal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Walter |last=Winchell |authorlink=Walter Winchell |title=Howz about calling the Russians our Frienemies? |work=[[Reno Gazette-Journal|Nevada State Journal]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |date=19 May 1953 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lucy |last=Cavendish |authorlink=Walter Winchell|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/8250216/The-best-of-frenemies.html|title=The best of frenemies|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |date=17 January 2011 |accessdate=11 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== People ==
A ''[[Businessweek]]'' article stated that frenemies in the workplace are common, due to increasingly informal environments and the "abundance of very close, intertwined relationships that bridge people's professional and personal lives ... [while] it certainly wasn't unheard of for people to socialize with colleagues in the past, the sheer amount of time that people spend at work now has left a lot of people with less time and inclination to develop friendships outside of the office."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/careers/content/jun2007/ca20070614_437227.htm Frenemies at Work], Liz Ryan, BusinessWeek, June 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] said of himself that “an intimate friend and a hated enemy have always been indispensable to my emotional life...not infrequently…friend and enemy have coincided in the same person”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ernest Jones, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'' (1964) p. 37 &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3386">'''Gruppo dei Sei''' (Group of Six) or '''Sei di Torino''' (Six from Turin) was a group of painters who emerged under the mentorship of [[Felice Casorati]] in [[Turin]] in the late 1920s. They exhibited together for three years starting in 1929. Although each artist had an individual style, they were linked together by the influence of Parisian [[post-impressionism]] and [[fauvism]], including the work of [[Amedeo Modigliani]], and their anti-fascist ideology – a position that set them apart from other movements like [[Novecento Italiano]] and [[Futurism]]. 

The six artists in the group were:

* [[Jessie Boswell]] ([[Leeds]], 1881 - [[Moncrivello]], 1956),
* [[Gigi Chessa]] (Turin, 1898 - Turin, 1935),
* [[Nicola Galante]], ([[Vasto]], 1883 - [[Turin]], 1969),
* [[Carlo Levi]] (Turin, 1902 - [[Rome]], 1975), 
* [[Francesco Menzio]] (Turin, 1899 - Turin, 1979),
* [[Enrico Paulucci Delle Roncole]] (Genoa, 1901 - Turin, 1999).

Their association was championed by art critics like [[Edoardo Persico]] and [[Lionello Venturi]] and contemporary art collector [[Riccardo Gualino]] who, together with his wife, had purchased a theater in Turin where he was endorsing avante garde music concerts, dances, art events and plays.

The six artists first exhibited together in the spring of 1929 at Galleria Guglielmi in Turin. In November the same year they had two other shows at Circolo della Stampa in [[Genoa]] and at Galleria Bardi in [[Milan]] (later to be known as Galleria Il Milione). A combination of personal and political disagreements eventually contributed to split the group apart, along with Gualino's decision to withdraw his financial support following the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and his being put under [[house arrest]] by [[Benito Mussolini]]'s government. Levi, Menzio, and Paulucci delle Roncole continued to exhibit together until 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Article assembled from Italian wikipedia entry.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ḥeḥ''' (also '''Huh''', '''Hah''', '''Hauh''', '''Huah''', and '''Hehu'''{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}) was the personification of [[Infinity (philosophy)|infinity]] or [[eternity]] in the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]] in [[Egyptian mythology]].&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 109"&gt;Wilkinson, Richard H. (2003). ''The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt''. Thames &amp; Hudson. p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; His name originally meant "flood", referring to the watery chaos that the Egyptians believed existed before the [[Ancient Egyptian creation myths|creation of the world]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen, James P. ''Genesis in Egypt: The Philosophy of Ancient Egyptian Creation Accounts''. Yale Egyptological Seminar, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptians envisioned this chaos as infinite, in contrast with the finite created world, so Heh personified this aspect of the primordial waters.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, James P. ''Middle Egyptian: An Introduction to the Language and Culture of Hieroglyphs''. Cambridge University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Heh's female counterpart was known as '''Hauhet''', which is simply the [[grammatical gender|feminine form]] of his name.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 109"/&gt;

Like the other concepts in the Ogdoad, his male form was often depicted as a [[frog]], or a frog-headed human, and his female form as a [[snake]] or snake-headed human. The frog head symbolised fertility, creation, and regeneration, and was also possessed by the other Ogdoad males Kek, Amun, and Nun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rush|first1=John|title=The Twelve Gates: A Spiritual Passage Through the Egyptian Books of the Dead|date=2007|publisher=Frog|location=Berkeley, CA|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other common representation depicts him crouching, holding a [[palm stem]] in each hand (or just one),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Owusu|first1=Heike|title=Egyptian Symbols|date=2008|publisher=Sterling|location=New York, NY|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes with a palm stem in his hair, as [[Palm tree|palm]] stems represented long life to the Egyptians, the years being represented by notches on it. Depictions of this form also had a [[shen ring]] at the base of each palm stem, which represented [[infinity]]. Depictions of Heh were also used in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] to represent one [[million]], which was essentially considered equivalent to infinity in [[Ancient Egyptian mathematics]]. Thus this deity is also known as the "god of millions of years". 

==Origins and mythology== 
The primary meaning of the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] word ''ḥeḥ'' was "million" or "millions"; a personification of this concept, Ḥeḥ, was adopted as the Egyptian god of infinity. With his female counterpart Ḥauḥet (or Ḥeḥut), Ḥeḥ represented one of the four god-goddess pairs comprising the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]], a pantheon of eight primeval deities whose worship was centred at [[Hermopolis Magna]].
The mythology of the Ogdoad describes its eight members, Heh and Hauhet, [[Nu (mythology)|Nu]] and [[Naunet]], [[Amun]] and [[Amaunet]], and [[Kuk (mythology)|Kuk]] and [[Kauket]], coming together in the cataclysmic event that gives rise to the sun (and its deific personification, [[Atum]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hart|first1=George|title=Egyptian Myths|date=1990|publisher=British Museum Publications|location=London|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms and iconography==
[[Image:Heh.svg|thumb|right|An aspect of Heh, holding a pair of notched palm branches]]
The god Ḥeḥ was usually depicted anthropomorphically, as in the hieroglyphic character, as a male figure with divine beard and lappet wig. Normally kneeling (one knee raised), sometimes in a basket—the sign for "all",  the god typically holds in each hand a notched palm branch (palm rib). (These were employed in the temples for ceremonial time-keeping, which use explains the use of the palm branch as the hieroglyphic symbol for ''rnp.t'', "year").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Remler|first1=Pat|title=Egyptian Mythology, A to Z|date=2010|publisher=Chelsea House|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, an additional palm branch is worn on the god's head.

In Ancient Egyptian Numerology, Gods such as Heh were used to represent numbers in a decimal point system. Particularly, the number 1,000,000 is depicted in the hieroglyph of Heh, who is position in his normal seated position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Imhausen|first1=Annette|authorlink=Annette Imhausen|title=Mathematics of Ancient Egypt|date=2016|publisher=Princeton University|location=Princeton|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult and worship==
The personified, somewhat abstract god of eternity Ḥeḥ possessed no known cult centre or sanctuary; rather, his veneration revolved around symbolism and personal belief. The god's image and its iconographic elements reflected the wish for millions of years of life or rule; as such, the figure of Ḥeḥ finds frequent representation in amulets, prestige items and royal iconography from the late [[Old Kingdom]] period onwards. Heh became associated with the King and his quest for longevity. For instance, he appears on the tomb of King Tutankhamen, in two cartouches, where he is crowned with a winged scarab beetle, symbolizing existence and a sun disk. The placement of Heh in relation to King Tutankhamen's corpse means he will be granting him these "millions of years" into the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Remler|first1=Pat|title=Egyptian Mythology, A to Z|date=2010|publisher=Chelsea House|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18949">'''Human rights in cyberspace''' is a relatively new and uncharted area of law. The [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] ([[UNHRC]]) has stated that the freedoms of expression and information under Article 19('''2''') of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] ([[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]]) include the freedom to receive and communicate information, ideas and opinions through the Internet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx|title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|last=United Nations Human Rights Committee|first=|date=|website=|page=|at=General Comment no.34, note 4, para 12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important clause is Article 19('''3''') of the ICCPR, which provides that:&lt;blockquote&gt;The exercise of the right provided in paragraph two of this article carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subjected to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary:&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;('''a''') For respect of the rights or reputations of others;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;('''b''') For the protection of national security or of public order, or of public health and morals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The HRC has stated that "the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online" (mentioning, in particular, freedom of expression).&lt;ref name="UN Doc A/HRC/RES/20/8 (2012), para1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/G12/153/25/PDF/G1215325.pdf|title=The promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet|last=|first=|date=|website=Human Rights Council Resolution|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely regarded that this freedom of information must be balanced with other rights. The question is raised whether people's expectations of human rights are different in cyberspace.&lt;ref name="AHRC" /&gt;

==Public privacy==
Public privacy encompasses [[freedom of information]] and expression on the Internet on the one side, and security and privacy in cyberspace on the other side.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|3}} In the context of cyberspace, privacy means using the Internet as a service tool for private purposes without the fear of third parties accessing and using user data in various ways without their consent.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|3}} 

The right to freedom encompasses the [[Freedom of expression|right of expression]] and is stated in several international treaties.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mihr|first1=Anja|date=2013|title=Public Privacy Human Rights in Cyberspace|url=http://www.anjamihr.com/app/download/21133105/Public%2BPrivacy-WP-AnjaMihr%245B1%245D.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} The right includes freedom to receive and impart information and ideas and to hold opinions without any state interference. It also includes the right to express oneself in any medium including exchanging ideas and thoughts through Internet platforms or social networks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Freedom means the right to political expression especially when it raises matters of public importance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;{{rp|3}} 

Most democratic countries advance the installation of the Internet for economic and communication purposes; therefore, political expression is given some protection on the Internet. Some governments actively move to protect citizen's data on the Internet. However, these intergovernmental agreements can lead to misuse and abuse of private data, which in turn can affect many other fundamental freedoms and basic human rights.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;{{rp|4}} The challenge for governments is balancing private interests with rules against privacy and freedom rights for all.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

==Governance in cyberspace==
German political scientist [[Anja Mihr]] says that cyberspace harbors more individuals than any other country in the world, yet it is without any government, legislative bodies, law enforcement or any other sort of constitution. Without these mechanisms difficulties arise in protecting and enjoying citizen's rights.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|1}} [[Intergovernmental organization|International Governmental Organisations]] (IGO's), such as the [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[Organization of American States]], the [[African Union]] or the [[European Union]] aim to set international standards for the use of cyberspace and the Internet to be enforced by national governments, but commonly fail to do so. The problem is that state powers and their mechanisms of enforcement do not extend past the state's borders.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|2}} 

Because cyberspace has no borders, the ways and means to govern it are as-yet undefined. This leads to problems wherein those who are willing to commit crimes find it easier to cross borders through the web, as it is unclear where jurisdiction lies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fanchiotti|first1=Vittoriio|last2=Pierini|first2=Jean Paul|date=2012|title=Impact of Cyberspace on Human Rights and Democracy|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a governing regime was ever established, it would most likely consist of multiple stakeholders and actors including national, international, and private actors such as representatives of companies, social networks, nongovernmental organizations as well as individuals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

==Liability of Internet service providers==
A question arises when there is a breach of an individual's basic human rights. Should the liability fall only on the originator of the breached right, or should the burden also fall on the [[Internet service provider]] (ISP)? This is an especially relevant issue when it comes to balancing free speech against defamation.&lt;ref name="mansell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/3707/1/Introduction%E2%80%93Human_Rights_and_Equity_in_Cyberspace_%28LSERO%29.pdf|title=Human Rights and Equality in Cyberspace|last1=Mansell|first1=Robin|date=2015-04-01|website=|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing speed and limitless audience of the Internet pose a greater danger to individuals and their reputations.&lt;ref name=AHRC&gt;{{cite web|title=Background Paper: Human Rights in Cyberspace |url= https://www.humanrights.gov.au/sites/default/files/document/publication/human_rights_cyberspace.pdf |website=Australian Human Right Commission|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

ISPs may not have the means to monitor content published on their websites, and may be unaware that a defamatory statement exists on their site.&lt;ref name="humanrights.ee" /&gt; This was demonstrated in the case [[Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe Inc.]]&lt;ref name="Rowland D, Free expression and Defamation"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Klang, Murray|first1=M. A. |title=Human Rights in the Digital Age|date=2005|pages=Chapter 5, p65}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it was found that the ISP was acting as a mere distributor and could not be liable for the content posted on its bulletin. However, in [[Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co.]]&lt;ref name="Rowland D, Free expression and Defamation" /&gt; the [[New York Supreme Court]] held that Prodigy acted as a publisher with an editorial function, and so was found liable. 

These cases highlight the ambiguity surrounding the liability placed upon ISPs.&lt;ref name="humanrights.ee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanrights.ee/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Kijanen_research.pdf|title=New Generation for Human rights in Cyberspace|last1=Kijanen|first1=Pekka|date=|website=|accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further question is whether ISPs will take it upon themselves to function as “moral guardians”&lt;ref name="mansell" /&gt; of cyberspace. If over-fanatical ISPs start refusing to host certain Internet sites, this may, in turn, compromise rights for the freedom of speech and freedom of expression. In comparison, ambiguity about ISPs liability could mean ISPs permit content without regard to its potentially harmful effects.&lt;ref name="mansell" /&gt;

==Cybersecurity==
Given the prevalence of hacking, viruses and zero day exploits, the [[World Wide Web]] ([[World Wide Web|WWW]]) is a non-secure storage space for the storage of sensitive private information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-08/smiley-credit-check-australians-financial-information-at-risk/8887198|title=Australians' financial information at risk in data breach of US company|date=2017-09-08|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/cybercrime-super-bowl-lii-not-get-hacked/|title=Cybercrime at Super Bowl LII - How not to get Hacked|date=2018-01-31|work=Hashed Out by The SSL Store™|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://face2faceafrica.com/article/8-ways-stay-safe-online|title=8 ways to stay safe online - Face2Face Africa|date=2018-02-06|work=Face2Face Africa|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/16/10-ways-keep-personal-data-safe|title=Internet security: 10 ways to keep your personal data safe from online snoopers|last=Naughton|first=John|date=2013-09-16|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2018/02/23/ransomware-attacks-rose-rapidly-in-2017-heres-how-you-can-protect-your-data/|title=Ransomware Attacks Rose Rapidly in 2017: Here’s How You Can Protect Your Data|last=Thompson|first=Jessica|date=2018-02-23|website=gigaom.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529015231/http://www.netindex.com/|title=Global Broadband and Mobile Performance Data Compiled by Ookla {{!}} Net Index|date=2015-05-29|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyberspace is a tool where individuals can exercise their freedom rights, but cyberspace cannot guarantee our freedom.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|11}} Today there are around 2.5 billion internet users. We are living in a world where everyone has a long data trail, so internet security is a high priority.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|12}}

Today more people than ever have a common understanding of privacy or freedom of expression therefore share common ideas as to how to protect and secure their private data.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;{{rp|13}} Still according to the Freedom in the Net Index &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529015231/http://www.netindex.com/|title=Global Broadband and Mobile Performance Data Compiled by Ookla {{!}} Net Index|date=2015-05-29|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; issued in 2013, most countries in the world censor Internet freedom, some more than others. Countries will do this in various ways. For example, using [[Internet police]]. There are many methods of filtering and censoring the exercise of freedom rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelly|last2=Truong|last3=Earp|last4=Reed|last5=Shahbaz|last6=Groco-Stoner|first1=Sanja|first2=Mai|first3=Madeline|first4=Laura|first5=Adrian|first6=Ashley|title=A Global Assessment of Internet and Digital Media|url=http://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/resurces/FOTN%202013_Full%20Report_0.pdf|website=Freedom on the net 2013|publisher=Freedom House 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The EU has invested in many filtering projects such as NETprotect I and II,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.netprotect.com/|title=NetProtect|website=NetProtect|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.net-protect.org/en/default.htm|title=More Information available at|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICRAsafe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fosi.org/icra/|title=Thank you for inquiring about ICRA®|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="More Information available at"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/information_society/activities/sip/projects/targeted/filtering/closed_projects/icrasafe/index_en.htm|title=More Information available at|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the PRINCIP programme.&lt;ref name="More Information available at" /&gt; It has been stated that self-censorship Internet users impose upon themselves is probably the most serious threat to Internet freedom. Mass surveillance and fear of private communications being made public lead to self-censorship. This results in individuals no longer using search engines or social networks to express their personal beliefs, ideas or opinions, as certain keywords may trigger concerns with national security agencies, resulting in the Internet becoming a political tool of manipulation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;{{rp|13}}

==Discriminatory behaviors==

===Cyber bullying===
Discriminatory behaviors that occur ‘offline’ also occur ‘online’ One of these behaviors is ‘cyber bullying’. [[Cyberbullying]] affects at least one in ten students in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amf.org.au/FactSheets|title=See the Alannah and Madeline Foundation's Bullying hurts brochure at|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyberbullying can impact on a range of human rights including: the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UDHR, art 25|website=ICESCR, art 12 (1); CRC art 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; rights to work and fair working conditions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UDHR, art 23|website=ICESCR, arts 6 and 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UDHR, art 19|website=ICESCR, art 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; a child or young person’s right to leisure and play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CRC, art 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/technology/contents-removed-from-racist-facebook--page-20120808-23tr1.html|title=Contents removed from racist Facebook page|last=Lowe|first=Asher Moses and Adrian|date=2012-08-08|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyber-racism===
[[Cyber racism]] can be in the form of individuals posting racist comments or participating in group pages specifically set up for a racist purpose.&lt;ref name=AHRC/&gt; A well publicised example of this was an Aboriginal memes Facebook page that consisted of various images of indigenous people with racist captions. It was reported that Facebook classified the page as ‘controversial humour’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/contents-removed-from-racit-facebook--page-20120808-23tr1.html|title=Contents removed from racist Facebook page|last1=Moses|first1=A|last2=Lowe|first2=A|date=|website=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hate speech===
Article 20 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]] states “Any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx |title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights |publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights |accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hate speech]] is intended to disturb violence or prejudicial actions against a group of people based on their ethnicity, race, nationality or sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="humanrights.ee"/&gt; Cyberspace has also been used in this way as a medium for destruction. 

The danger to human rights becomes apparent when terrorists form together to scheme and agitate people to commit violence towards a common good. “[[Al-Qaeda]]” moved to cyberspace, “the ultimate ungoverned territory” where schools were set up for promotion of ideological and military training and active propaganda arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/world/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9472498|title=A world wide web of terror|last=|first=|date=|website=The Economist|accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has become a stated subject of importance that these situations are monitored to prepare for future generations of cyber-terrorists.&lt;ref name="humanrights.ee" /&gt;

==Future of human rights in the Digital Age==
The future of human rights in cyberspace depends on the evolution of the law and its interpretation by national and international governing bodies.&lt;ref name=mansell/&gt; [[Jon Bing]] warns that once rules and regulations are automated, they become extremely arduous to subject to judicial review.&lt;ref name=mansell/&gt; Bing states that we face a situation in which “technology [is] implementing the law”.&lt;ref name=mansell/&gt; 

Roger Brownsword looked at some of the issues associated with developments in biotechnology and human rights alongside those raised by digital technologies and suggested three ethical positions on the issues: a utilitarian pragmatic stance, a defense of human rights, and a “dignitarian alliance”.&lt;ref name="mansell" /&gt; Of the three positions, [[Andrew Brownsword|Brownsword]] claims the first two are popular in the UK, stating that technologies are being developed that treat human subjects as if they lack autonomy and the capacity to choose for themselves.&lt;ref name="mansell" /&gt; 

Recent official discussions have taken place as to the future of cyberspace. In April 2008, the Virtual Law Conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtuallawconference.com/|title=More Information available at|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; was held in New York. The conference included participants such as [[Microsoft]], [[Sony]], and the [[Walt Disney Company]]. The agenda included discussion of intellectual property enforcement, legal issues arising from virtual currency, legal issues arising from virtual property, ethical concerns for attorneys and executives in virtual worlds, and how to litigate a virtual lawsuit.&lt;ref name="humanrights.ee" /&gt; 

The US Congressional Hearing on Virtual Worlds took place with the purpose of education and exploring the prospects of virtual worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energycommerce.house.gov/cmte_mtgs/110-ti-hrg.040108.VirtualWorlds.shtml|title=Online Virtual World: Applications in a User Generated Medium|last=|first=|date=|website=The Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet|accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agenda included an analysis of concerns related to consumer protection, intellectual property protection, and child protection, among others. This hearing was one of the first legislative inquiries into virtual worlds. It remains to be seen whether either of these gatherings hold any lasting impact on the field, which continues to rapidly evolve in lockstep with advancing technology.&lt;ref name="humanrights.ee" /&gt;

The ''ideal observer'' is a theoretical system that performs a specific task in an optimal way.  If there is uncertainty in the task, then perfect performance is impossible and the ideal observer will make errors.

''Ideal performance'' is the theoretical upper limit of performance.  It is theoretically impossible for a real system to perform better than ideal.  Typically, real systems are only capable of sub-ideal performance.

This technique is useful for analyzing psychophysical data (see [[psychophysics]]).

==Definition==

Many definitions of this term have been offered.

'''Geisler (2003)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Visual Neurosciences |chapter=Ideal Observer Analysis |last=Geisler |first=Wilson S. |editor1-first=Leo M. |editor1-last=Chalupa |editor2-first=John S. |editor2-last=Werner |year=2003 |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |location= |isbn= 9780262033084|pages=825–837 |accessdate=August 19, 2012 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=AN-sdYjcyvAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Visual+Neurosciences#v=onepage&amp;q=Ideal%20Observer%20analysis&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; (slightly reworded):  The central concept in ideal observer analysis is the ''ideal observer'', a theoretical device that performs a given task in an optimal fashion given the available information and some specified constraints.  This is not to say that ideal observers perform without error, but rather that they perform at the physical limit of what is possible in the situation.  The fundamental role of uncertainty and noise implies that ideal observers must be defined in probabilistic (statistical) terms.  ''Ideal observer analysis'' involves determining the performance of the ideal observer in a given task and then comparing its performance to that of a real [[perceptual system]], which (depending on the application) might be the system as a whole, a subsystem, or an elementary component of the system (e.g. a neuron).

==Sequential ideal observer analysis==

In '''sequential ideal observer analysis''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=W. S. Geisler |year=1989 |title=Sequential ideal-observer analysis of visual discriminations |journal=[[Psychological Review]] |volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=267–314 |doi= 10.1037/0033-295x.96.2.267|pmc= |pmid=2652171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the goal is to measure a real system's performance deficit (relative to ideal) at different processing stages.  Such an approach is useful when studying systems that process information in discrete (or semi-discrete) stages or modules.

==Natural and pseudo-natural tasks==

To facilitate experimental design in the laboratory, an artificial task may be designed so that the system's performance in the task may be studied.  If the task is too artificial, the system may be pushed away from a natural mode of operation.  Depending on the goals of the experiment, this may diminish its [[external validity]].

In such cases, it may be important to keep the system operating naturally (or almost naturally) by designing a pseudo-natural task.  Such tasks are still artificial, but they attempt to mimic the natural demands placed on a system.  For example, the task might employ stimuli that resemble natural [[scene (perception)|scenes]] and might test the system's ability to make potentially useful judgments about these stimuli.

[[Scene statistics|Natural scene statistics]] are the basis for calculating ideal performance in natural and pseudo-natural tasks.  This calculation tends to incorporate elements of [[Detection theory|signal detection theory]], [[information theory]], or [[estimation theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11864">'''Identification''' is a psychological process whereby the subject assimilates an aspect, property, or attribute of the other and is transformed wholly or partially by the model that other provides. It is by means of a series of identifications that the personality is constituted and specified. The roots of the concept can be found in [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s writings. The three most prominent concepts of identification as described by Freud are: primary identification, [[Narcissism of small differences|narcissistic]] (secondary) identification and partial (secondary) identification.&lt;ref name="laplanche"&gt;Laplanche, J. and Pontalis, J.-B. (1973), The language of psychoanalysis. The Hogarth Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

While "in the psychoanalytic literature there is agreement that the core meaning of identification is simple – to be like or to become like another", it has also been adjudged '"the most perplexing clinical/theoretical area" in psychoanalysis'.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Macmillan, ''Freud Evaluated'' (1997) p. 496 (quoting Rangell)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud==

Freud first raised the matter of identification ({{lang-de|Identifizierung}}) in 1897, in connection with the illness or death of one's parents, and the response "to punish oneself in a hysterical fashion...with the same states [of illness] that they have had. The identification which occurs here is, as we can see, nothing other than a mode of thinking".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, quoted by Angela Richards "Editor's Note", ''On Metapsychology'' (Penguin Freud Library 11, 1987) p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; The question was taken up again psychoanalytically "in Ferenczi's article, 'Introjection and Transference', dating from 1909",&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; but it was in the decade between "[[On Narcissism]]" (1914) and "[[The Ego and the Id]]" (1923) that Freud made his most detailed and intensive study of the concept.

Freud distinguished three main kinds of identification. "First, identification is the original form of emotional tie with an object; secondly, in a regressive way it becomes a substitute for a libidinal object-tie...and thirdly, it may arise with any new perception of a common quality which is shared with some other person".&lt;ref&gt;"[[Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego]]", in Sigmund Freud, ''civilisation, Society and Religion'' (Penguin Freud Library 12) p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary identification===
Primary identification is the original and primitive form of [[attachment theory|emotional attachment]] to something or someone prior to any relations with other persons or objects:&lt;ref name="meissner"&gt;W.W. Meissner, 1970. Notes on Identification I. Origins in Freud, ''[[Psychoanalytic Quarterly]]'', 39, 563-589.&lt;/ref&gt; "an individual's first and most important identification, his identification with the father in his own personal prehistory...with the parents".&lt;ref&gt;"The Ego and the Id", ''Metapsychology'' p. 370&lt;/ref&gt; This means that when a baby is born he is not capable of making a distinction between himself and important others. The baby has an emotional attachment with his parents and experiences his parents as a part of himself. "The breast is part of me, I am the breast".

During this process of identification children adopt unconsciously the characteristics of their parents and begin to associate themselves with and copy the behavior of their parents. Freud remarked that identification should be distinguished from [[imitation]], which is a voluntary and conscious act. Because of this process of emotional attachment a child will develop a [[Super ego|(super)ego]] that has similarities to the moral values and guidelines by which the parents live their lives. By this process children become a great deal like their parents and this facilitates learning to live in the world and culture to which they are born.&lt;ref name="answers"&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/identification (5 May 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

"By and large, psychoanalysts grant the importance and centrality of primary identification, even though...the concept varies 'according to each author and his ideas, its meaning in consequence being far from precise' ([[Horacio Etchegoyen|Etchegoyen]] 1985)".&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, p. 497&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narcissistic (secondary) identification===
Narcissistic identification is the form of identification following abandonment or loss of an object. This experience of loss starts at a very young age.&lt;ref name="meissner" /&gt; An example: wearing the clothes or jewellery of a deceased loved one.&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;Hart, H. H. (1947), Problems of Identification. Psychiatric Quarterly, 21, 274-293.&lt;/ref&gt; In "Mourning and Melancholia" Freud, having "shown that identification is a preliminary stage of object-choice", argued that the experience of loss set in motion a regressive process that "served to establish an ''identification'' of the ego with the abandoned object".&lt;ref&gt;''Metapsychology'' p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; In "The Ego and the Id", he went on to maintain that "this kind of substitution has a great share in determining the form taken by the ego and that it makes an essential contribution towards building up what is called its 'character'".&lt;ref&gt;''Metapsychology'' p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], in his theory of [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|the Imaginary]], would develop the latter point into his view of "the ego is constituted in its nucleus by a series of alienating identifications"&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits'' (London 1996) p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; - part of his opposition to any concept of an "autonomous" and conflict-free ego.

===Partial (secondary) identification===
Partial identification is based on the perception of a special quality of another person.&lt;ref name="meissner" /&gt; This quality or ideal is often represented in a "leader figure" who is identified with. For example: the young boy identifies with the strong muscles of an older neighbour boy. Next to identification with the leader, people identify with others because they feel they have something in common. For example: a group of people who like the same music. This mechanism plays an important role in the formation of groups. It contributes to the development of character and the ego is formed by identification with a group (group norms). Partial identification promotes the social life of persons who will be able to identify with one another through this common bond to one another, instead of considering someone as a rival.&lt;ref name="answers" /&gt;

===Partial identification and empathy===

Freud went on to indicate the way "a path leads from identification by way of imitation to [[empathy]], that is, to the comprehension of the mechanism by which we are enabled to take up any attitude at all towards another mental life".&lt;ref&gt;''Civilization'' p. 140n&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otto Fenichel]] would go on to emphasize how "trial identifications for the purposes of empathy play a basic part in normal object relationships. They can be studied especially in analyzing the psychoanalyst's ways of working".&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 511&lt;/ref&gt; [[Object relations theory]] would subsequently highlight the use of "''trial identification with the patient in the session''"&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1996) p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the growing technique of analysing from the [[countertransference]].

==Anna Freud and identification with the aggressor==

In her classic book ''The Ego and the Mechanism of Defence'', [[Anna Freud]] introduced "two original defence mechanisms...both of which have become classics of [[ego psychology]]",&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Appignanesi/John Forrester, ''Freud's Women'' ( London 1993) p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; the one being altruistic surrender, the other identification with the aggressor. Anna Freud pointed out that identification with parental values was a normal part of the development of the [[superego]]; but that "if the child introjects both rebuke and punishment and then regularly projects this same punishment on another, 'then he is arrested at an intermediate stage in the development of the superego'".&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was also taken up in object relations theory, which particularly explored "how a patient sometimes places the analyst in the role of victim whilst the patient acts out an identification with the aggressor"&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further learning from the patient'' (london 1996) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; in the analytic situation.

==With the analyst==

Mainstream analytic thought broadly agrees that interpretation took effect "by utilizing positive transference and transitory identifications with the analyst".&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 570&lt;/ref&gt;  More controversial, however, was the concept of "the terminal identification" at the close of analysis, where "that with which the patient identifies is their strong ego...[or] identification with the analyst's superego".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'' p. 274 and p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacan took strong exception to "any analysis that one teaches as having to be terminated by identification with the analyst...There is a beyond to this identification...this crossing of the plane of identification".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis'' (London 1994) p. 271-3&lt;/ref&gt; Most Lacanians have subsequently echoed his distrust of "the view of psychoanalysis that relies on identification with the analyst as a central curative factor".&lt;ref&gt;John P. Muller, ''Beyond the Psychoanalytic Dyad'' (1996) p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; How far the same criticism applies, however, to those who see as a positive therapeutic result "the development of a self-analytic attitude...[built on] identification with and internalization of the analyst's analytic attitude"&lt;ref&gt;Alan S. Gurman, ''Essential Psychotherapies'' (2003) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; is not perhaps quite clear.

[[Marion Milner]] has argued that "terminal identification" can be most acute in those analysands who go on to become therapists themselves: "by the mere fact of becoming analysts we have succeeded in bypassing an experience which our patients have to go through. We have chosen to identify with our analyst's profession and to act out that identification".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychoanalytic thinking today==
Much has been written on identification since Freud. Identification has been seen both as a normal developmental mechanism and as a [[Defence mechanism|mechanism of defence]].&lt;ref name="sandler"&gt;{{cite book | last=Sandler | first=J. | title=Projection, Identification, Projective Identification. | publisher=International Universities Press, Inc., Madison Connecticut. | year=1987 | isbn=0823643700}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many types of identification have been described by other psychoanalysts, including counter-identification (Fliess,1953),&lt;ref name="sandler" /&gt; pseudoidentification (Eidelberg, 1938),&lt;ref name="sandler" /&gt; concordant and complementary identifications (Racker, 1957),&lt;ref name="sandler" /&gt; and adhesive identification (Bick, 1968):&lt;ref name="sandler" /&gt; "the work of Bick and others on adhesive identification, exploring the concept of the [[Didier Anzieu|'psychic skin']]".&lt;ref&gt;Judith Mitrani and Joyce McDougall, ''A Framework for the Imaginary'' (London 2008) p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism''''' is a book by [[Benedict Anderson]]. It introduces a popular concept in political sciences and sociology, that of [[imagined communities]] named after it. It was first published in 1983, and reissued with additional chapters in 1991 and a further revised version in 2006.

[[Eric G.E. Zuelow]] described this book as "perhaps the most read book about [[nationalism]]".&lt;ref name=nationalismproject&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalismproject.org/books/a_b.htm|title=The Nationalism Project: Books by Author A-B|work=nationalismproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nationalism and imagined communities==
According to Anderson's theory of imagined communities, the main causes of nationalism are the declining importance of privileged access to particular script languages (such as [[Latin]]) because of mass [[vernacular]] literacy;{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} the movement to abolish the ideas of rule by divine right and hereditary monarchy;{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} and the emergence of printing press capitalism ("the convergence of capitalism and print technology... standardization of national calendars, clocks and language was embodied in books and the publication of daily newspapers")&lt;ref name=nationalismproject/&gt;—all phenomena occurring with the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref name=nationalismproject/&gt;

==Nation as an imagined community==
According to Anderson, [[nation]]s are [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]].&lt;ref name=sage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/9613_020037ch1and2.pdf|title=Benedict Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Anderson, the idea of the "nation" is relatively new and is a product of various socio-material forces. He defined a nation as "an imagined political community – and imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign".&lt;ref name="ic"&gt;{{cite book |title=Imagined communities: reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism |last=Anderson |first=Benedict R. O'G. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1991 |publisher=Verso |location=London |isbn=978-0-86091-546-1
 |pages=6–7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4mmoZFtCpuoC |edition=Revised and extended.|accessdate= 5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Anderson puts it, a nation "is imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion".&lt;ref name="ic"/&gt; While members of the community probably will never know each of the other members face to face, they may have similar interests or identify as part of the same nation. Members hold in their minds a mental image of their affinity: for example, the nationhood felt with other members of your nation when your "imagined community" participates in a larger event such as the [[Olympic Games]].

Nations are "limited" in that they have "finite, if elastic boundaries, beyond which lie other nations".&lt;ref name="ic"/&gt; They are "sovereign" since no dynastic monarchy can claim authority over them, in the modern period:
{{quote|text=[T]he concept was born in an age in which Enlightenment and Revolution were destroying the legitimacy of the divinely-ordained, hierarchical dynastic realm. Coming to maturity at a stage of human history when even the most devout adherents of any universal religion were inescapably confronted with the living pluralism of such religions, and the allomorphism [incongruence, divide] between each faith's ontological claims and territorial stretch, nations dream of being free, and, if under God, directly so. The gauge and emblem of this freedom is the sovereign state.&lt;ref name="ic"/&gt;}}
Even though we may never see anyone in our imagined community, we still know they are there through communication.

Finally, a nation is a [[community]] because,
{{quote|regardless of the actual inequality and exploitation that may prevail in each, the nation is always conceived as a deep, horizontal comradeship. Ultimately it is this fraternity that makes it possible, over the past two centuries, for so many millions of people, not so much to kill, as willingly to die for such limited imaginings.&lt;ref name="ic"/&gt;}}

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6662">In [[mathematics]], especially in the field of [[category theory]], the concept of '''injective object''' is a generalization of the concept of [[injective module]]. This concept is important in [[cohomology]], in [[homotopy theory]] and in the theory of [[model category|model categories]]. The dual notion is that of a [[projective object]].

==Definition==
[[File:Diagrammadefinizionemoduloiniettivo.png|thumb|An object {{var|Q}} is injective if, given a monomorphism {{var|f}} : {{var|X}} → {{var|Y}}, any {{var|g}} : {{var|X}} → {{var|Q}} can be extended to {{var|Y}}.]]

An object &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; in the category &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''injective''' if for every [[monomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;f: X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; and every morphism &lt;math&gt;g: X \to Q&lt;/math&gt; there exists a morphism &lt;math&gt;h: Y \to Q&lt;/math&gt; extending &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. such that &lt;math&gt; h \circ f = g&lt;/math&gt;.

The morphism &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; in the above definition is not required to be uniquely determined by &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

In a locally small category, it is equivalent to require that the [[hom functor]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathfrak{C}}(-,Q)&lt;/math&gt; carries monomorphisms in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt; to surjective set maps.

==In Abelian categories==
The notion of injectivity was first formulated for [[Abelian category|abelian categories]], and this is still one of its primary areas of application. When &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; is an abelian category, an object ''Q'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; is injective [[if and only if]] its [[hom functor]] Hom&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;ndash;,''Q'') is [[exact functor|exact]].

If
:&lt;math&gt;0 \to Q \to U \to V \to 0&lt;/math&gt;
is an [[exact sequence]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; such that ''Q'' is injective, then the [[splitting lemma|sequence splits]].

==Enough injectives and injective hulls==
The category &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt; is said to ''have enough injectives'' if for every object ''X'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a monomorphism from ''X'' to an injective object. 

A monomorphism ''g'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt; is called an [[essential monomorphism]] if for any morphism ''f'', the composite ''fg'' is a monomorphism only if ''f'' is a monomorphism.

If ''g'' is an essential monomorphism with domain ''X'' and an injective codomain ''G'', then ''G'' is called an '''injective hull''' of ''X''.  The injective hull is then uniquely determined by ''X'' [[up to]] a non-canonical isomorphism.

==Examples==
*In the category of [[Abelian group]]s and [[group homomorphism]]s, an injective object is necessarily a [[divisible group]]. Assuming the axiom of choice, the notions are equivalent.
*In the category of [[Module (mathematics)|modules]] and [[module homomorphism]]s, ''R''-Mod, an injective object is an [[injective module]]. ''R''-Mod has [[injective hull]]s (as a consequence, R-Mod has enough injectives).
*In the category of [[metric space]]s and [[nonexpansive mapping]]s, [[Category of metric spaces|Met]], an injective object is an [[injective metric space]], and the injective hull of a metric space is its [[tight span]].
*In the category of [[T0 space]]s and [[continuous mapping]]s, an injective object is always a [[Scott topology]] on a [[continuous lattice]] therefore it is always [[Sober space|sober]] and [[locally compact]].

==Uses==
If an abelian category has enough injectives, we can form [[Injective resolution|injective resolutions]], i.e. for a given object ''X'' we can form a long exact sequence
:&lt;math&gt;0\to X \to Q^0 \to Q^1 \to Q^2 \to \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
and one can then define the [[derived functor]]s of a given functor ''F'' by applying ''F'' to this sequence and computing the homology of the resulting (not necessarily exact) sequence. This approach is used to define [[Ext functor|Ext]] and [[Tor functor|Tor]] functors and also the various [[cohomology]] theories in [[group theory]], [[algebraic topology]] and [[algebraic geometry]]. The categories being used are typically [[functor category|functor categories]] or categories of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] of [[sheaf of modules|O&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; modules]] over some [[ringed space]] (''X'',O&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;) or in general any [[Grothendieck category]].

== Generalization ==
[[File:Injective object.svg|thumb|An object {{var|Q}} is {{var|H}}-injective if, given {{var|h}} : {{var|A}} → {{var|B}} in {{var|H}}, any {{var|f}} : {{var|A}} → {{var|Q}} [[List of mathematical jargon#factor through|factors through]] {{var|h}}.]]

Let  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt; be a category and let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Class (set theory)|class]] of [[Morphism|morphisms]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

An object &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;''-injective''' if for every morphism &lt;math&gt;f: A \to Q&lt;/math&gt; and every morphism &lt;math&gt;h: A \to B&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; there exists a morphism &lt;math&gt;g: B \to Q&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; g \circ h = f&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; is the class of [[monomorphism]]s, we are back to the injective objects that were treated above.

The category &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt; is said to ''have enough &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;-injectives'' if for every object ''X'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt;, there exist a ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;''-morphism from ''X'' to an ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;''-injective object.

A ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;''-morphism ''g'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt; is called '''''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;''-essential''' if for any morphism ''f'', the composite ''fg'' is in ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;'' only if ''f'' is in ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;''.

If ''g'' is a ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;''-essential morphism with domain ''X'' and an ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;''-injective codomain ''G'', then ''G'' is called an '''''H''-injective hull''' of ''X''. 

=== Examples ===

*In the category of [[simplicial set]]s, the injective objects with respect to the class ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;'' of [[anodyne extension]]s are [[Kan complex]]es.
*In the category of partially ordered sets and monotonic functions, the [[complete lattice]]s form the injective objects for the class ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;'' of [[order-embedding]]s, and the [[Dedekind–MacNeille completion]] of a partially ordered set is its ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;''-injective hull.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14718">'''Internal set theory''' ('''IST''') is a mathematical theory of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] developed by [[Edward Nelson]] that provides an axiomatic basis for a portion of the [[non-standard analysis]] introduced by [[Abraham Robinson]]. Instead of adding new elements to the [[real number]]s, Nelson's approach modifies the axiomatic foundations through syntactic enrichment.  Thus, the axioms introduce a new term, "standard", which can be used to make discriminations not possible under the conventional  [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms|axioms for sets]].  Thus, IST is an enrichment of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]]: all axioms of ZFC are satisfied for all classical predicates, while the new unary predicate "standard" satisfies three additional axioms I, S, and T.  In particular, suitable non-standard elements within the set of real numbers can be shown to have properties that correspond to the properties of [[infinitesimal]] and unlimited elements.

Nelson's formulation is made more accessible for the lay-mathematician by leaving out many of the complexities of meta-mathematical [[logic]] that were initially required to justify rigorously the consistency of number systems containing infinitesimal elements.

==Intuitive justification==
Whilst IST has a perfectly formal axiomatic scheme, described below, an intuitive justification of the meaning of the term ''standard'' is desirable. This is '''not''' part of the formal theory, but is a pedagogical device that might help the student interpret the formalism. The essential distinction, similar to the concept of [[definable number]]s, contrasts the finiteness of the domain of concepts that we can specify and discuss with the unbounded infinity of the set of numbers; compare [[finitism]].
* The number of symbols one writes with is finite.
* The number of mathematical symbols on any given page is finite.
* The number of pages of mathematics a single mathematician can produce in a lifetime is finite.
* Any workable mathematical definition is necessarily finite.
* There are only a finite number of distinct objects a mathematician can define in a lifetime.
* There will only be a finite number of mathematicians in the course of our (presumably finite) civilization.
* Hence there is only a finite set of whole numbers our civilization can discuss in its allotted lifespan.
* What that limit actually is, is unknowable to us, being contingent on many accidental cultural factors.
* This limitation is not in itself susceptible to mathematical scrutiny, but that there is such a limit, whilst the set of whole numbers continues forever without bound, is a mathematical truth.

The term ''standard'' is therefore intuitively taken to correspond to some necessarily finite portion of "accessible" whole numbers. The argument can be applied to any infinite set of objects whatsoever – there are only so many elements that one can specify in finite time using a finite set of symbols and there are always those that lie beyond the limits of our patience and endurance, no matter how we persevere. We must admit to a profusion of ''non-standard'' elements — too large or too anonymous to grasp — within any infinite set.

===Principles of the ''standard'' predicate===

The following principles follow from the above intuitive motivation and so should be deducible from the formal axioms. For the moment we take the domain of discussion as being the familiar set of whole numbers.
* Any mathematical expression that does not use the new predicate ''standard'' explicitly or implicitly is an ''internal formula''.
* Any definition that does so is an ''external formula''.
* Any number ''uniquely'' specified by an internal formula is standard (by definition).
* Non-standard numbers are precisely those that cannot be uniquely specified (due to limitations of time and space) by an internal formula.
* Non-standard numbers are elusive: each one is too enormous to be manageable in decimal notation or any other representation, explicit or implicit, no matter how ingenious your notation. Whatever you succeed in producing is &lt;u&gt;by-definition&lt;/u&gt; merely another standard number.
* Nevertheless, there are (many) non-standard whole numbers in any infinite subset of '''N'''.
* Non-standard numbers are completely ordinary numbers, having decimal representations, prime factorizations, etc. Every classical theorem that applies to the natural numbers applies to the non-standard natural numbers. We have created, not new numbers, but a new method of discriminating between existing numbers.
* Moreover, any classical theorem that is true for all standard numbers is necessarily true for all natural numbers. Otherwise the formulation "the smallest number that fails to satisfy the theorem" would be an internal formula that uniquely defined a non-standard number.
* The predicate "non-standard" is a [[logically consistent]] method for distinguishing ''large'' numbers — the usual term will be ''illimited''. Reciprocals of these illimited numbers will necessarily be extremely small real numbers — ''infinitesimals''. To avoid confusion with other interpretations of these words, in newer articles on IST those words are replaced with the constructs "i-large" and "i-small".
* There are necessarily only finitely many standard numbers - but caution is required: we cannot gather them together and hold that the result is a well-defined mathematical set. This will not be supported by the formalism (the intuitive justification being that the precise bounds of this set vary with time and history). In particular we will not be able to talk about the largest standard number, or the smallest non-standard number. It will be valid to talk about some finite set that contains all standard numbers - but this non-classical formulation could only apply to a non-standard set.

==Formal axioms for IST==
IST is an axiomatic theory in the [[first-order logic]] with equality in a [[signature (logic)|language]] containing a binary predicate symbol ∈ and a unary predicate symbol st(''x''). Formulas not involving st (i.e., formulas of the usual language of set theory) are called internal, other formulas are called external. We use the abbreviations
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\exists^\mathrm{st}x\,\phi(x)&amp;=\exists x\,(\operatorname{st}(x)\land\phi(x)),\\
\forall^\mathrm{st}x\,\phi(x)&amp;=\forall x\,(\operatorname{st}(x)\to\phi(x)).\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
IST includes all axioms of the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] with the [[axiom of choice]] (ZFC). Note that the ZFC schemata of [[Axiom of separation|separation]] and [[Axiom of replacement|replacement]] are ''not'' extended to the new language, they can only be used with internal formulas. Moreover, IST includes three new axiom schemata – conveniently one for each letter in its name: '''I'''dealisation, '''S'''tandardisation, and '''T'''ransfer.

===''I'': Idealisation===
*For any internal formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; without free occurrence of ''z'', the universal closure of the following formula is an axiom:
*:&lt;math&gt;\forall^\mathrm{st}z\,(z\text{ is finite}\to\exists y\,\forall x\in z\,\phi(x,y,u_1,\dots,u_n))\leftrightarrow\exists y\,\forall^\mathrm{st}x\,\phi(x,y,u_1,\dots,u_n).&lt;/math&gt;
*In words: For every internal relation ''R'', and for arbitrary values for all other free variables, we have that if for each standard, finite set ''F'', there exists a ''g'' such that ''R''(''g'',&amp;nbsp;''f'') holds for all ''f'' in ''F'', then there is a particular ''G'' such that for ''any standard'' ''f'' we have ''R''(''G'',&amp;nbsp;''f''), and conversely, if there exists ''G'' such that for any standard ''f'', we have ''R''(''G'',&amp;nbsp;''f''), then for each finite set ''F'', there exists a ''g'' such that ''R''(''g'',&amp;nbsp;''f'') holds for all ''f'' in ''F''.

The statement of this axiom comprises two implications. The right-to-left implication can be reformulated by the simple statement that elements of standard finite sets are standard. The more important left-to-right implication expresses that the collection of all standard sets is contained in a finite (non-standard) set, and moreover, this finite set can be taken to satisfy any given internal property shared by all standard finite sets.

This very general axiom scheme upholds the existence of "ideal" elements in appropriate circumstances. Three particular applications demonstrate  important consequences.

====Applied to the relation ≠====
If ''S'' is standard and finite, we take for the relation ''R''(''g'',&amp;nbsp;''f''): ''g'' and ''f'' are not equal and ''g'' is in ''S''.  Since "''For every standard finite set F there is an element g in S such that {{nowrap|g ≠ f}} for all f in F''" is false (no such ''g'' exists when {{nowrap|''F'' {{=}} ''S''}}), we may use Idealisation to tell us that "''There is a G in S such that {{nowrap|G ≠ f}} for all standard f''" is also false, i.e. all the elements of ''S'' are standard.

If ''S'' is infinite, then we take for the relation ''R''(''g'',&amp;nbsp;''f''): ''g'' and ''f'' are not equal and ''g'' is in ''S''. Since "''For every standard finite set F there is an element g in S such that {{nowrap|g ≠ f}} for all f in F''" (the infinite set ''S'' is not a subset of the finite set ''F''), we may use Idealisation to derive "''There is a G in S such that {{nowrap|G ≠ f}} for all standard f''."  In other words, every infinite set contains a non-standard element (many, in fact).

The power set of a standard finite set is standard (by Transfer) and finite, so all the subsets of a standard finite set are standard.

If ''S'' is non-standard, we take for the relation ''R''(''g'',&amp;nbsp;''f''): ''g'' and ''f'' are not equal and ''g'' is in ''S''. Since "''For every standard finite set F there is an element g in S such that {{nowrap|g ≠ f}} for all f in F''" (the non-standard set ''S'' is not a subset of the standard and finite set ''F''), we may use Idealisation to derive "''There is a G in S such that {{nowrap|G ≠ f}} for all standard f.''"  In other words, every non-standard set contains a non-standard element.

As a consequence of all these results, all the elements of a set ''S'' are standard if and only if ''S'' is standard and finite.

====Applied to the relation &amp;lt;====
Since "''For every standard, finite set of natural numbers F there is a natural number g such that {{nowrap|g &gt; f}} for all f in F''" – say, {{nowrap|''g'' {{=}} maximum(''F'') + 1}} – we may use Idealisation to derive "''There is a natural number G such that {{nowrap|G &gt; f}} for all standard natural numbers f''."  In other words, there exists a natural number greater than each standard natural number.

====Applied to the  relation ∈====
More precisely we take for ''R''(''g'',&amp;nbsp;''f''): ''g'' is a finite set containing element ''f''. Since "''For every standard, finite set F, there is a finite set g such that {{nowrap|f ∈ g}} for all f in F''" – say by choosing {{nowrap|''g'' {{=}} ''F''}} itself – we may use Idealisation to derive "''There is a finite set G such that {{nowrap|f ∈ G}} for all standard f''."&lt;!--  In other words, all standard sets can be contained in a finite set as elements. --&gt; For any set ''S'', the intersection of ''S'' with the set ''G'' is a finite subset of ''S'' that contains every standard element of ''S''. ''G'' is necessarily nonstandard.

===S: Standardisation===
*If &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is any formula (it may be external) without a free occurrence of ''y'', the universal closure of
*:&lt;math&gt;\forall^\mathrm{st}x\,\exists^\mathrm{st}y\,\forall^\mathrm{st}t\,(t\in y\leftrightarrow(t\in x\land\phi(t,u_1,\dots,u_n)))&lt;/math&gt;
:is an axiom.
*In words: If ''A'' is a standard set and P any property, internal or otherwise, then there is a unique, standard subset ''B'' of ''A'' whose standard elements are precisely the standard elements of ''A'' satisfying ''P'' (but the behaviour of ''B''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s non-standard elements is not prescribed).

===T: Transfer===
*If &lt;math&gt;\phi(x,u_1,\dots,u_n)&lt;/math&gt; is an internal formula with no other free variables than those indicated, then
*:&lt;math&gt;\forall^\mathrm{st}u_1\dots\forall^\mathrm{st}u_n\,(\forall^\mathrm{st}x\,\phi(x,u_1,\dots,u_n)\to\forall x\,\phi(x,u_1,\dots,u_n))&lt;/math&gt;
:is an axiom.
*In words: If all the parameters  ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ..., ''W'' of an internal formula ''F'' have standard values then {{nowrap|''F''(''x'', ''A'', ''B'',..., ''W'')}} holds for all ''x''{{'}}s as soon as it holds for all standard ''x''{{'}}s&amp;mdash;from which it follows that all uniquely defined concepts or objects within classical mathematics are standard.

==Formal justification for the axioms==
Aside from the intuitive motivations suggested above, it is necessary to justify that additional IST axioms do not lead to errors or inconsistencies in reasoning. Mistakes and philosophical weaknesses in reasoning about infinitesimal numbers in the work of [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[Johann Bernoulli]], [[Leonhard Euler]], [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], and others were the reason that they were originally abandoned for the more cumbersome{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[real number]]-based arguments  developed by [[Georg Cantor]], [[Richard Dedekind]], and [[Karl Weierstrass]], which were perceived as being more rigorous by Weierstrass's followers.

The approach for internal set theory is the same as that for any new axiomatic system - we construct a [[model theory|model]] for the new axioms using the elements of a simpler, more trusted, axiom scheme. This is quite similar to justifying the consistency of the axioms of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] by noting they can be modeled by an appropriate interpretation of [[great circle]]s on a sphere in ordinary 3-space.

In fact via a suitable model a proof can be given of the relative consistency of IST as compared with ZFC: if ZFC is consistent, then IST is consistent.  In fact, a stronger statement can be made: IST is a [[conservative extension]] of ZFC: any internal formula that can be proven within internal set theory can be proven in the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms with the Axiom of Choice alone.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Edward (1977).

The '''International Day of Non-Violence''' is observed on [[2 October]], the birthday of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. This day is referred to in [[India]] as ''[[Gandhi Jayanti]]''.

In January 2004, Iranian Nobel laureate [[Shirin Ebadi]] had taken a proposal for an International Day of [[Non-Violence]] from a Hindi teacher in Paris teaching international students to the [[World Social Forum]] in Mumbai. The idea gradually attracted the interest of some leaders of India's [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]] ("[[Ahimsa]] Finds Teen Voice", The Telegraph, Calcutta) until a Satyagraha Conference resolution in New Delhi in January 2007, initiated by [[Indian National Congress]] President and Chairperson of the [[United Progressive Alliance]] [[Sonia Gandhi]] and Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], called upon the United Nations to adopt the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-gandhi-s-birthday-non-violence-day-1077094|title= Conference calls for declaring International day of non-violence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 June 2007 the [[United Nations General Assembly]] voted to establish 2 October as the International Day of Non-Violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=22926&amp;Cr=non&amp;Cr1=violence |title=UN declares 2 October, Gandhi’s birthday, as International Day of Non-Violence |publisher=[[United Nations]] |date=15 June 2007 |accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution by the General Assembly asks all members of the UN system to commemorate 2 October in "an appropriate manner and disseminate the message of [[non-violence]], including through education and public awareness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2007/ga10601.doc.htm |title=General Assembly Adopts Texts On Day Of Non-Violence, Ethiopian Millennium; Pays Tribute To Former Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim |publisher=United Nations |date=15 June 2007 |accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Postal Administration]] (UNPA) in New York City prepared a special cachet to commemorate this event, following a request from the Indian Ambassador at the Permanent Mission of India to the UN.  The boxed pictorial cachet design was prepared by the UNPA and was limited to cancellation at UNPA's NY location (not Geneva and Vienna). The UNPA has indicated that all outgoing UNPA mail between 2 and 31 October carried the cachet.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://gandhi.topicalphilately.com/PDF/UNPA2007.htm |title=Topical Philately Related to Mohandas K.

Her case has received international publicity, and has been the subject of multiple books, films, and television series.

On May 19, 1977, Colleen Stan was [[hitchhiking]] from her home in [[Eugene, Oregon]], to a friend's home in northern California, where she was heading to a birthday party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 'Girl in the Box' Speaks: How I Survived Being Held Captive for 7 Years|url=http://people.com/crime/girl-in-the-box-speaks-how-i-survived-my-seven-year-ordeal/|work=People|series=Crime|date=September 7, 2016|author=Egan, Nicole Weisensee|accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron Hooker (born November 5, 1953) kidnapped 20 year-old Stan after picking her up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steinbrecher |first=Ed |title=Hooker, Cameron Michael |url=http://www.astro.com/astro-databank/Hooker,_Cameron_Michael |work=astrological data |publisher=Astro-Databank |accessdate=June 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715071124/http://www.astro.com/astro-databank/Hooker%2C_Cameron_Michael |archivedate=July 15, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stan stated that she was an experienced hitchhiker and had allowed two rides to go past before accepting the ride with Hooker. She reportedly "felt confident climbing into the blue van",&lt;ref&gt;(Woollard p.&amp;nbsp;5)&lt;/ref&gt; because Hooker's wife, Janice, and their baby were in the car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woollard|first=Lisa|title=I was locked in a box for 7 years!|url=http://www.closeronline.co.uk/RealLife/Reallifestories/i-was-locked-in-a-box-for-7-years.aspx|work=Online Article|publisher=Closer Online|accessdate=June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When they stopped at a gas station along the way, Stan went to use the restroom.  "A voice told me to run and jump out a window and never look back," she recalled, but she calmed her fears and went back to the car. According to Stan and Janice Hooker's testimonies, once they were alone in an isolated area, Hooker pulled off the highway and put a knife to Stan's throat.{{sfn|Green|2009|p=22}} She was subsequently locked in a wooden head box which was designed to prevent light, sound and fresh air from entering.{{sfn|Green|2009|p=23}}

==Imprisonment==
Before this, Cameron and Janice had reached an agreement that he could capture a slave to take to Janice's place, because up until that time Cameron had been using Janice to act out [[Bondage (BDSM)#BDSM|sexual bondage]]. There was to be no [[Penetrative sexual intercourse|penetrative sex]] with Stan according to the agreement, but this later changed.{{sfn|Green|2009|pages=172 &amp; 175}} On the first night of her kidnapping, Stan was strung up by her hands and physically attacked by Cameron, being left blindfolded and suspended while the pair [[Sexual intercourse|had sex]] below her.{{sfn|Green|2009|p=28}}

After her kidnapping, Stan stated that she was tortured and kept locked in a box 23 hours a day until she was given a contract and forced to sign herself into slavery for life in January 1978. She further stated that Cameron led her to believe that she was being watched by a large, powerful organization called "The Company" which would painfully torture her and harm her family if she tried to escape.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite web|title=CNN Saturday Morning News|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1305/11/smn.04.html|work=[[CNN]]|publisher=Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.|accessdate=December 25, 2013|date=May 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stan subsequently became a slave referred to as "K"&lt;ref name=CBS&gt;{{cite news|last=LaRosa|first=Paul|title=Exclusive: Woman Imprisoned in Coffin for 7 Years Has Special Message for Jaycee Dugard|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/exclusive-woman-imprisoned-in-coffin-for-7-years-has-special-message-for-jaycee-dugard/|accessdate=December 25, 2013|newspaper=[[CBS News]]|date=September 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was forced to call Cameron "Master", and was not allowed to talk without permission. Cameron reportedly wanted Stan to be like the female character in the 1954 French [[erotic novel]], ''[[Story of O]]'' and soon started raping her,{{sfn|Green|pages=59–64}} which consisted of oral [[rape]]. Cameron did not want to have vaginal sex with Stan because he considered that to be a breach in his agreement with his wife. Instead he raped her vaginally and anally with implements. Following this, the Hooker family moved to a mobile home in Red Bluff with Stan, where she was kept locked in wooden boxes under the couple's water bed. In 1978, Janice gave birth to a second child on the water bed above Stan.{{sfn|Green|2009|p=84}}

Stan said that her faith in [[God]] and belief of escape helped her survive;{{sfn|Green|2009|p=6}} her greatest fear was of "The Company", which Cameron "reinforced" daily.{{sfn|Green|2009|p=65}} To avoid painful punishments, Stan tried to comply with his commandments,{{sfn|Green|2009|p=184}} which later led to her being allowed to go out to jog, work in the yard, and care for the family's children in the mobile home. Even with an open door, neighbors and a telephone, she made no attempt to escape as—according to Stan—her fear of "The Company" kept her from seeking help.{{sfn|Green|2009|p=88}} Additionally, Stan was allowed to visit her family by herself in 1981&lt;ref name=CBS/&gt; but did not reveal her situation because of her fear and the possible consequences.&lt;ref name=CBS/&gt; Her family thought she was involved in a cult because of her homemade clothes, lack of money and absence of communications over the years; they did not want to pressure her fearing she would go away forever. The next day, Stan returned with Hooker as her boyfriend.&lt;ref name=CBS/&gt; At the trial Stan explained that she was happy due to visiting her family, who were therefore able to take a photograph of the pair happily smiling together.{{sfn|Green|2009|pages=108–117}}

According to Stan, Hooker feared he had given his slave too much freedom and took her back to his mobile home where he locked her in the wooden box under his water bed; she remained in the box 23 hours a day for the next three years.{{sfn|Green|2009|p=118}} [[Toilet|Bodily function]]s were dealt with by her using a [[bed pan]] which she hooked under herself with her feet. It was stated in court that Hookers' children were told "K" had gone home; however, after the children had gone to bed, Hooker took Colleen out of the box to feed and torture her.{{sfn|Green|2009|pages=118–121}} She was reportedly not allowed to make any noise and had to lie still 23 hours long at a time in the dark with little air to breathe. In summer, conditions were especially harsh on her as the temperatures would swelter to over 100 degrees in her box. To feed herself, she ate cold scraps of food.

==Aftermath and consequences==

===Escape and trial===
It was not until 1983 that Stan was reintroduced to the children and neighbors, with her being also allowed to get a job as a maid at a motel.{{sfn|Green|2009|pages=131–132}} Hooker wanted Stan to become his second wife, which was a turning point for Janice.{{sfn|Green|2009|p=178}} Janice confessed that—starting with their first date—she had also been tortured, [[Mind control|brainwashed]] and referred to as a whore over the years by Cameron.{{sfn|Green|2009|pages=170–172}} Janice further stated that she survived their relationship with [[denial]] and [[Compartmentalization (psychology)|compartmentalization]]. By August 1984, Janice began struggling with herself, and also went to Stan in order to inform her that Hooker was not part of "The Company". However, she did maintain that the organization did exist.{{sfn|Green|2009|p=136}} In a televised interview for ''Girl in the Box'', Stan told the interviewer that she then went to a bus station and called Hooker to inform him that she was leaving him, and that he reacted by bursting into tears; Stan subsequently caught a bus home. In the months that followed, she did not contact the police but continued to call Hooker regularly; she explained this at the trial by saying that she wanted to give Hooker, at Janice's request, a chance to reform. Three months later, Janice reported her husband to the police.{{sfn|Green|2009|p=179}} She informed Lt. Jerry D. Brown of the Red Bluff Police that Cameron had kidnapped, tortured, and murdered Marie Elizabeth Spannhake, who had disappeared in 1976.{{sfn|Green|2009|pages=151–153}} Authorities were unable to locate the remains of the woman. Due to the lack of physical proof, no murder charge was brought.

[[Chris Hatcher (psychologist)|Chris Hatcher]], a [[forensic psychologist]] and [[criminal profiler]], testified for Cameron's prosecution at the start of the 1985 trial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ewing |first=Charles |author2=Joseph McCann  |title= Minds on Trial: Great Cases in Law and Psychology |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |year= 2006 |isbn= 978-0-19-518176-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Janice testified against her husband in exchange for full immunity.&lt;ref name=parole&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.khou.com/story/news/nation/2015/04/16/girl-in-box-kidnapper-parole-hearing/25888837/|title=Man who tortured 'girl in the box' denied parole|first=Cristina |last=Mendonsa|date=April 16, 2015|accessdate=May 22, 2015|work=[[KXTV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, her husband was sentenced to consecutive terms—for sexual assaults, kidnapping and for using a knife in the process—for a total of 104 years of imprisonment. Originally not eligible for parole until 2023, he had his hearing date moved up seven years to 2015 by California's Elderly Parole Program. On April 16, 2015, Hooker's request for parole was denied, with him being eligible for another hearing in 2022.&lt;ref name=parole/&gt;

Once back home, Stan studied for an accounting degree, married, and had a daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author="Free Girl"|url=http://www.unsolvedmysteries.com/usm250422.html|title=The Girl in the Box by Free Girl|publisher=Unsolvedmysteries.com |accessdate=June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also joined an organization to help abused women. Both she and Janice have changed their last names and continue to live in California,&lt;ref name="piper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://piperpost.net/truetales1.htm |title=True Tales Number 1: The Seven Year Hitchhike |publisher=Piperpost.net |date=May 19, 1977 |accessdate=June 8, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528191857/http://piperpost.net/truetales1.htm |archivedate=May 28, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but with no communication.

===Cultural impact===
The case and its core elements of an invisible conspiracy used to coerce the victim into servitude and long periods of confinement has formed the basis for several episodes of television crime series, including ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' (episode "The Company", season seven), ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'' (episode "Ball &amp; Chain", season four), and ''[[Law and Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' (episode "Slaves", [[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 1)|season one]]). It was also profiled in the 2008 episode "Kidnapped" of [[Investigation Discovery]] series ''[[Wicked Attraction]]''. A 2012 episode of [[SyFy]] series ''[[Paranormal Witness]]'', "The Apartment", told the story of the disappearance of Marie Spannhake, and includes a cameo mention of Stan's kidnapping. The case was also mentioned in passing during an episode of ''[[Waking the Dead (TV series)|Waking the Dead]]'' (episode "Fugue States", part 1, season 4). It was also documented in the book ''Perfect Victim: The True Story of the Girl in the Box'' (1989) by prosecutor Christine McGuire and Carla Norton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mcguire |first=Christine |last2=Norton |first2=Carla |title=Perfect Victim: The True Story of "The Girl in the Box" by the D.A. That Prosecuted Her Captor |publisher=[[Dell]] |year= 1989 |isbn=978-0440204428 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and referenced in [[Kathy Reichs]]' novel ''[[Monday Mourning]]'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reichs |first=Kathy |title=Monday Mourning: A Novel |publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-0743233477 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, American rock band [[Elysian Fields (band)|Elysian Fields]] released a song titled "Jack in the Box" for their debut studio album, ''Bleed Your Cedar'', which was made available for purchase that same year. Its lyrical content delves into Stan's experience of being imprisoned by Cameron in the box under the bed he shared with his wife, and alludes to the power he had over her. The case inspired the name for [[Richard Ramirez (musician)|Richard Ramirez]]'s Texas [[Noise music|experimental noise]] group Black Leather Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.houstonpress.com/music/black-leather-jesus-the-most-horrifying-origin-story-ever-6760212 |title=Black Leather Jesus: The Most Horrifying Origin Story Ever |access-date=July 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a short opera piece composed by Patrik Jarlestam and Jonas Bernander was based on the kidnapping, and premiered in [[Stockholm]], Sweden under the name of ''Den 4444:e dagen'' (''The 4444th day'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://patrikjarlestam.se/works.htm |title=Patrik Jarlestam Portfolio |website=patrikjarlestam.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the main plot of ''[[The Poughkeepsie Tapes]]'' (2007) was based on this case. An updated version of Stan's story, ''Colleen Stan, The Simple Gifts of Life'' by Jim Green, was published in 2009.

On September 10, 2016, a television movie based on the case titled ''Girl in the Box'' premiered on [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] starring [[Addison Timlin]] as Colleen Stan, [[Zane Holtz]] as Cameron Hooker, and [[Zelda Williams]] as Janice Hooker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nicole Weisensee |last=Egan |url=http://www.people.com/article/how-girl-in-the-box-became-lifetime-movie |title=WATCH: How the 'Girl in the Box' Became a Lifetime Movie – Nearly 40 Years After Her Kidnapping |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |date=September 9, 2016 |access-date=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Lindsay |last=MacDonald |url=http://zap2it.com/2016/09/liftime-girl-in-the-box-based-on-true-story/ |title=TV Query: Is Lifetime’s ‘Girl in the Box’ based on a true story? |work=[[Zap2it]] |date=September 10, 2016 |access-date=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the movie was followed by a two-hour documentary called ''Colleen Stan: Girl in the Box''.

The '''Kosher tax''' was one of several indirect taxes imposed by the Russian Imperial government and sometimes by [[Hapsburg empire]], Germany and Moldavia on Jews.&lt;ref name="ji"&gt;[[Herman Rosenthal|Rosenthal, Herman]]; [[Jacob Goodale Lipman|Lipman, J.G.]] [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=394&amp;letter=B "Basket-Tax"], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Belovinskiĭ2003p357"&gt;Leonid Vasilʹevich Belovinskiĭ.

==Russia==

In [[Russia]], the tax, known as the ''korobka'', was a tax paid only by Jews for each animal slaughtered in accordance with the [[kashrut]] rules and for each pound of this meat sold.&lt;ref name="ji"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shtetlinks.jewishgen.org/kraziai/history_tax_on_jews.htm Korobka Tax on Kraziai's Jews], Document 49-1-1362 from the Kaunas Archive&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of the Russian Jewish "basket tax" or "box tax". Though it was used to refer to a tax on meat or slaughtering, the word ''korobka'' (Russian: коробка) actually means "box" in Russian. The tax came to be called that because Jews paying had to deposit a coin in a box at the kosher slaughterer.&lt;ref name=Diner2001p164&gt;[[Hasia R. Diner|Diner, Hasia R.]] ''Hungering for America: Italian, Irish, and Jewish Foodways in the Age of Migration'', [[Harvard University Press]], 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-674-00605-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zU1WYFWxn74C&amp;pg=PA164 p.&amp;nbsp;164.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Herman Rosenthal]] and [[Jacob Goodale Lipman]], the tax was "the most burdensome and annoying of the special taxes imposed upon the Jews of Russia by the government".&lt;ref name="ji"/&gt; The burden of taxes, and the ''korobka'' in particular, was one of the factors which drove many Jews to abandon the towns and settle in villages or on noblemen estates.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Judaica (1971): History, vol. 8, 734&lt;/ref&gt;

==Galicia==
With the annexation to Austria in 1772, special taxes were imposed on [[Galician Jews]] ("[[Ostjuden|Eastern Jews]]") for marriage permits, kosher meat, synagogues, and similar items.

Between 1777 to 1784, the Jews of [[Horodenka]], a region on the south-east corner of Galicia, paid a number of special taxes, including the "Protection and [[Tolerance tax|Tolerance Tax]]", and "Property and Occupation tax". In 1784, the Property and Occupation Tax was cancelled and replaced with the Kosher Meat Tax.&lt;ref&gt;Gelber, N. M. ''The History of the Jews of Horodenka'', p.&amp;nbsp;86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moldavia==

In 1741, [[Moldavia]]n prince [[Grigore II Ghica|Grigore Ghica]] confirmed the obligation of each Jew to pay the ''crupca'', an indirect tax on kosher meat similar to the Russian ''korobka''.&lt;ref&gt;Herşcovici, Lucian-Zeev (August 16, 2010). "[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Iasi Iaşi]." Translated from Romanian by Anca Mircea. ''YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe''. Retrieved 2016-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==

In the 18th and 19th centuries, [[Germany]] appears to have had a "kosher meat tax" imposed by municipalities and used to support the local Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |

'''Language complexity''' is a topic in [[linguistics]] which can be divided into several sub-topics such as [[Phonology|phonological]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], [[Syntax|syntactic]], and [[Semantics|semantic]] complexity.&lt;ref name="Miestamo2008"&gt;{{cite book

Language complexity has been studied less than many other traditional fields of linguistics. While the [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]] is turning towards recognizing that complexity is a suitable research area, a central focus has been on [[Methodology of science|methodological]] choices. Some languages, particularly [[pidgin]]s and [[Creole language|creoles]], are considered simpler than most other languages, but there is no direct ranking, and no universal method of measurement although several possibilities are now proposed within different schools of analysis.&lt;ref name="Joseph2012"&gt;{{cite journal

== History ==
Throughout the 19th century, differential complexity was taken for granted. The classical languages [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], as well as [[Sanskrit]], were considered to possess qualities which could be achieved by the rising European [[national language]]s only through an elaboration that would give them the necessary structural and lexical complexity that would meet the requirements of an advanced civilization. At the same time, languages described as 'primitive' were naturally considered to reflect the simplicity of their speakers. On the other hand, [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] noted that some nations "which appear to be at the very lowest grade of intellectual culture", such as [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Sámi languages|Sámi]] and some [[native American languages]], possess a striking degree of elaborateness.&lt;ref name="Joseph2012" /&gt;

[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] considered the apparent complexity of many non-[[Western countries|Western]] languages as problematic for [[evolution theory]] which in his time held that less advanced people should have less complex languages. Darwin's suggestion was that simplicity and irregularities were the result of extensive [[language contact]] while "the extremely complex and regular construction of many barbarous languages" should be seen as an utmost perfection of the one and same evolutionary process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Equal complexity hypothesis ===
During the 20th century, linguists and [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] adopted a [[standpoint theory|standpoint]] that would reject any [[Nationalism|nationalist]] ideas about superiority of the languages of establishment. The first known quote that puts forward the idea that all languages are equally complex comes from Rulon S. Wells III, 1954, who attributes it to [[Charles F. Hockett]]. Within a year, the same idea found its way to [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]:
{{Quote|text="''All languages of today are equally complex''(.) -- ''There are no 'primitive' languages, but all languages seem to be equally old and equally developed.''"&lt;ref name="Joseph2012" /&gt;}}

While laymen never ceased to consider certain languages as simple and others as complex, such a view was erased from official contexts. For instance, the 1971 edition of [[Guinness Book of World Records]] featured [[Saramaccan language|Saramaccan]], a creole language, as "the world's least complex language". According to linguists, this claim was "not founded on any serious evidence", and it was removed from later editions.&lt;ref name="Arends2001"&gt;{{cite journal

 | title = Simple grammars, complex languages

 | pages = 180–182
 | publisher = De Gruyter
 | location = Berlin
 | year = 2001
 | issn =1430-0532 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparent complexity differences in certain areas were explained with a balancing force by which the simplicity in one area would be compensated with the complexity of another; e.g. [[David Crystal]], 1987:
{{Quote|text="''All languages have a complex grammar: there may be relative simplicity in one respect (e.g., no word-endings), but there seems always to be relative complexity in another (e.g., word-position)''".&lt;ref name="McWhorter2001"&gt;{{cite journal
 | last1 = McWhorter | first1 = John H.
 | title = The world's simplest grammars are creole grammars
 | journal = Linguistic Typology
 | volume = 5
 | issue = 2/3
 | pages = 125–166
 | publisher = De Gruyter
 | location = Berlin
 | year = 2001
 | issn =1430-0532 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In 2001 the compensation hypothesis was eventually refuted by the [[African-American]] [[creolistics|creolist]] [[John McWhorter]] who pointed out the absurdity of the idea that, as languages change, each would have to include a mechanism that calibrates it according to the complexity of all the other 6,000 or so languages around the world; but linguistics has no knowledge of any such a mechanism.&lt;ref name="McWhorter2001" /&gt;

Revisiting the idea of differential complexity, McWhorter argued that it is indeed creole languages, such as Saramaccan, that are structurally "much simpler than all but very few older languages". In McWhorter's notion this is not problematic in terms of the equality of creole languages because simpler structures convey [[logic|logical meanings]] in the most straightforward manner, while increased language complexity is largely a question of features which may not add much to the functionality, or improve usefulness, of the language. Examples of such features are [[Inalienable possession|inalienable possessive]] marking, [[switch-reference]] marking, syntactic asymmetries between [[Matrix clause|matrix]] and [[Subordination (linguistics)|subordinate clauses]], [[grammatical gender]], and other secondary features which are most typically absent in creoles.&lt;ref name="McWhorter2001" /&gt;

During the years following McWhorter's article, several books and dozens of articles were published on the topic.&lt;ref name="Newmeyer2014" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} As to date, there have been research projects on language complexity, and several workshops for researchers have been organised by various universities.&lt;ref name="Miestamo2008" /&gt;

== Complexity metrics ==
At a general level, language complexity can be characterized as the number and variety of elements, and the elaborateness of their interrelational structure.&lt;ref name="Rescher1998"&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Rescher
 | first = Nicholas
 | title = Complexity. A philosophical overview.

* '''Syntagmatic complexity''': number of parts, such as word length in terms of phonemes, syllables etc.
* '''Paradigmatic complexity''': variety of parts, such as phoneme inventory size, number of distinctions in a grammatical category, e.g. aspect
* '''Organizational complexity''': e.g. ways of arranging components, phonotactic restrictions, variety of word orders.
* '''Hierarchic complexity''': e.g. recursion, lexical–semantic hierarchies.&lt;ref name="Sinnemäki2011" /&gt;

Measuring complexity is considered difficult, and the comparison of whole natural languages as a daunting task. On a more detailed level, it is possible to demonstrate that some structures are more complex than others. Phonology and morphology are areas where such comparisons have traditionally been made. For instance, linguistics has tools for the assessment of the phonological system of any given language. As for the study of syntactic complexity, grammatical rules have been proposed as a basis,&lt;ref name="McWhorter2001" /&gt; but generative frameworks, such as [[Minimalist Program]] and [[Simpler Syntax]], have been less successful in defining complexity and its predictions than non-formal ways of description.&lt;ref name="Hawkins2014"&gt;{{Citation

Many researchers suggest that several different concepts may be needed when approaching complexity: entropy, size, description length, effective complexity, information, connectivity, irreducibility, low probability, syntactic depth etc. Research suggests that while methodological choices affect the results, even rather crude analytic tools may provide a feasible starting point for measuring grammatical complexity.&lt;ref name="Sinnemäki2011" /&gt;

==A comparison==
Guy (1994)&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Guy, [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!original/sci.lang/KEHWJV90fgg/mSswvn0Z--MJ "sci.lang FAQ"], [[message-ID]]: 3bjmtc$ci3@medici.trl.OZ.AU, [[sci.lang]], 1994, December 1&lt;/ref&gt; illustrates the point{{which|date=January 2016}} by comparing two [[Santo languages]] he has worked on that are about as closely related as [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Tolomako language|Tolomako]] and [[Sakao language|Sakao]], both spoken in the village of [[Port Olry]], [[Vanuatu]]. Because these languages are very similar to each other, and equally distant from English, he holds that neither is inherently biased as being seen as more easy or difficult by an English speaker (see [[difficulty of learning languages]]).

===Phonology===
Sakao has more, and more difficult, vowel distinctions than Tolomako:
{|
|- valign=top
|
{| class="wikitable IPA"
|+ Tolomako vowels
! !!front&lt;br&gt;unrounded !! back&lt;br&gt;rounded
|- align=center

|- align=center

|}
| &lt;br&gt;
{|class=wikitable
|In addition, Sakao has a close vowel {{IPA|/ɨ/}} that is unspecified for being rounded or unrounded, front or back, and is always unstressed. It also has the two [[diphthong]]s {{IPA|/œɛ, ɒɔ/}}, whereas Tolomako has none.
|}
|}

In addition, it has more and more difficult consonant distinctions:
{|
|- valign=top
|
{| class="wikitable IPA"
|+ Tolomako consonants
! !!labial!!alveolar!!velar
|- align=center
! nasal

| &lt;br&gt;
{|class=wikitable
|In addition, Sakao consonants may be long or short: {{IPA|/œβe/}} "drum", {{IPA|/œββe/}} "bed"
|}
|}

Tolomako has a simple syllable structure, maximally consonant–vowel–vowel. It is not clear if Sakao even has syllables; that is, whether trying to divide Sakao words into meaningful syllables is even possible.
{|
|
{| class=wikitable
|+ Tolomako {{nowrap|syllable structure}}
|-
|{{nowrap|[[vowel|V]], [[consonant|C]]V, VV, CVV}}
|}
|
{| class=wikitable
|+ Sakao syllable structure
|-
|V (a vowel or diphthong) surrounded by any number of consonants: &lt;br&gt;V {{IPA|/i/}} "thou", CCVCCCC (?) {{IPA|/mhɛrtpr/}} "having sung and stopped singing thou kept silent" &lt;br&gt;{{nowrap|[{{IPA|m-}} 2nd pers., {{IPA|hɛrt}} "to sing", {{IPA|-p}} [[perfective]], {{IPA|-r}} continuous].}}
|}
|}

===Morphology===
With [[Inalienable possession|inalienably possessed]] nouns, Tolomako inflections are consistently regular, whereas Sakao is full of irregular nouns:
{|
|
{| class="wikitable IPA"
|-
! Tolomako !! Sakao !! English
|-
| na tsiɣo-ku || œsɨŋœ-ɣ || "my mouth"
|-
| na tsiɣo-mu || œsɨŋœ-m || "thy mouth"
|-
| na tsiɣo-na || ɔsɨŋɔ-n || "his/her/its mouth"
|-
| na tsiɣo-... || œsœŋ-... || "...'s mouth"
|}
|
{| class="wikitable IPA"
|-
! Tolomako !! Sakao !! English
|-
| na βulu-ku || uly-ɣ || "my hair"
|-
| na βulu-mu || uly-m || "thy hair"
|-
| na βulu-na || ulœ-n || "his/her/its hair"
|-
| na βulu-... || nøl-... || "...'s hair"
|}
|}
Here Tolomako "mouth" is invariably ''{{IPA|tsiɣo-}}'' and "hair" invariably ''{{IPA|βulu-}},'' whereas Sakao "mouth" is variably ''{{IPA|œsɨŋœ-, ɔsɨŋɔ-, œsœŋ-}}'' and "hair" variably ''{{IPA|uly-, ulœ-, nøl-}}.''

===Syntax===
With [[deixis]], Tolomako has three degrees (here/this, there/that, yonder/yon), whereas Sakao has seven.

Tolomako has a [[preposition]] to distinguish the [[object (grammar)|object]] of a verb from an instrument; indeed, a single preposition, ''ne,'' is used for all relationships of space and time. Sakao, on the other hand, treats both as objects of the verb, with a transitive suffix ''{{IPA|-ɨn}}'' that shows the verb has two objects, but letting context disambiguate which is which:

{|
|- valign=top
|
{| class="wikitable IPA"
|+ Tolomako
|mo||losi||na||poe||ne||na||matsa
|-
|S/he||hits||[[article (grammar)|{{sc|art}}]]||pig||[[preposition|{{sc|prep}}]]||{{sc|art}}||club
|-
|colspan=7|"He hits (kills) the pig with a club"
|}
|
{| class="wikitable IPA"
|+ Sakao
|mɨ-jil-ɨn||a-ra||a-mas
|-
|S/he-hits-[[transitive verb|{{sc|trans}}]]||{{sc|art}}-pig||{{sc|art}}-club
|-
|colspan=3|"He hits (kills) the pig with a club"
|}
| &lt;br&gt;
{|class=wikitable
| The Sakao could also be ''{{IPA|mɨjilɨn amas ara}}''
|}
|}

The Sakao strategy involves [[polysynthetic]] syntax, as opposed to the isolating syntax of Tolomako:
{| class="wikitable IPA"
|+ Sakao polysynthesis
|colspan=3|Mɔssɔnɛshɔβrɨn aða ɛðɛ &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (or: ɛðɛ aða)
|-
|mɔ-sɔn-nɛs-hɔβ-r-ɨn || a-ða || ɛ-ðɛ
|-
|s/he-shoots-fish-follows-[[continuous aspect|{{sc|cont}}]]-{{sc|trans}} ||{{sc|art}}-bow ||{{sc|art}}-sea
|-
|colspan=3|"He kept on walking along the shore shooting fish with a bow."
|}

Here ''{{IPA|aða}}'' "the bow" is the instrumental of ''{{IPA|sɔn}}'' "to shoot", and ''{{IPA|ɛðɛ}}'' "the sea" is the direct object of ''{{IPA|hoβ}}'' "to follow", which because they are combined into a single verb, are marked as [[ditransitive]] with the suffix ''{{IPA|-ɨn}}.'' Because ''{{IPA|sɔn}}'' "to shoot" has the [[noun incorporation|incorporated]] object ''{{IPA|nɛs}}'' "fish", the first consonant [[gemination|geminates]] for ''{{IPA|ssɔn}}''; ''{{IPA|ssɔn-nɛs}},'' being part of one word, then reduces to ''{{IPA|ssɔnɛs}}.'' And indeed, the previous example of killing a pig could be put more succinctly, but grammatically more complexly, in Sakao by incorporating the object 'pig' into the verb:

{| class="wikitable IPA"
|-
|colspan=2|mɨjilrapɨn amas
|-
|mɨ-jil-ra-p-ɨn || a-mas
|-
|s/he-hit-pig-[[perfective aspect|{{sc|pfv}}]]-{{sc|trans}} ||{{sc|art}}-club
|}

Guy asks rhetorically, "Which of the two languages spoken in Port-Olry do you think the Catholic missionaries learnt and used? Could that possibly be because it was easier than the other?"

==Language complexity and creoles==
It is generally acknowledged that, as young languages, [[creole language|creoles]] are necessarily simpler than non-creoles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/conference/2013_APiCS/files/abstracts.html |title=Creole and pidgin language structure in cross-linguistic perspective &amp;#124; Abstracts |publisher=Eva.mpg.de |date= |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guy believes this to be untrue {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}; after a comparison with [[Antillean Creole]], he writes, "I assure you that it is far, far more complex than Tolomako!", despite being based on his native language, French.

==History and growth==
Lehigh Technologies has been manufacturing MRP at its commercial plant since 2007. According to Lehigh, the company has demonstrated steady growth since it began manufacturing MRP at commercial scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=St. John|first=Jeff|title=Lehigh Raises $16M for Freeze-Dry Tire Recycling|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/lehigh-the-freeze-dried-turbo-milled-tire-recycler-raises-5m11|accessdate=30 May 2014|newspaper=Greentech Media|date=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Lehigh was selected as a [[World Economic Forum#Technology Pioneers Programme|Technology Pioneer]] by the [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Technology Pioneers 2010|url=http://www.weforum.org/content/pages/list-technology-pioneers-2010|publisher=World Economic Forum|accessdate=30 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609032241/http://www.weforum.org/content/pages/list-technology-pioneers-2010|archivedate=9 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards program recognizes companies from around the world that are involved in the design, development and deployment of new technologies that are set to have a significant impact on business and society.

In June 2011, Lehigh announced that more than 100&amp;nbsp;million tires on the road had been manufactured using the company's MRP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lehigh Technologies Reaches Milestone of 100 Million Tires Manufactured Using Polydyne Micronized Rubber Powder.

==Research and development==
In November 2010, Lehigh expanded its in-house capabilities with the launch of the Application &amp; Development Center (ADC), a dedicated research and development facility staffed by a team of industry professionals. The stated mission of the ADC is to develop new applications for MRP and to accelerate adoption of existing MRP applications by improving understanding of MRP chemistry, providing expert advice for new material formulations that incorporate MRP, and developing new materials based on MRP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lehigh Launches its Application &amp; Development Center|url=http://www.lehightechnologies.com/index.php/news_events/press_releases/lehigh_launches_its_application_development_center/|publisher=Lehigh Technologies|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, Lehigh announced an expansion of its ADC that includes the hiring of new technical staff and investment in new mixing and analytical equipment. According to Lehigh, this expansion improves the ADC’s ability to develop functional materials based on MRP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lehigh invests in mixing equipment, hires tech manager|url=http://www.rubbernews.com/article/20140121/NEWS/140129981/lehigh-invests-in-mixing-equipment-hires-tech-manager|accessdate=30 May 2014|newspaper=Rubber News|date=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
In addition to its production facility in Atlanta, Lehigh has developed a network of partners and distributors.

===Asia===
Lehigh partnered with Connell Brothers Corporation (CBC), the largest distributor of specialty chemicals and ingredients in Asia-Pacific, to market its MRP in Japan, In 2014, Lehigh announced an expanded partnership with CBC, aimed at broadening industry outreach, supply chain efficiency and technical support in Japan, as well as introducing MRP to South Korea and Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=De Guzman|first=Doris|title=Connell Brothers partners with Lehigh Technologies|url=http://greenchemicalsblog.com/2014/03/25/connell-brothers-partners-with-lehigh-technologies/|accessdate=30 May 2014|newspaper=Green Chemicals Blog|date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, Lehigh announced the closing of an $8 million fundraise with JSR Corporation, a $4 billion specialty chemicals company based in Japan, to support the company’s geographic expansion and technology roadmap for MRP in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dorbian|first=Iris|title=Lehigh Technologies nabs $8 mln|url=http://www.pehub.com/2014/09/lehigh-technologies-nabs-8-mln/|accessdate=8 September 2014|newspaper=PE Hub|date=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
{{Main|Micronized rubber powder}}

Lehigh has commercialized a proprietary cryogenic turbo mill technology that transforms end-of-life tires and post-industrial rubber materials into micronized rubber powders. Lehigh produces MRP from [[vulcanization|vulcanized]] [[elastomer]]ic material, most often end-of-life tire material. However, it can also be produced from post-industrial nitrile rubber, [[EPDM rubber|ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM)]], [[butyl]], and natural rubber compounds.

===Products===
Lehigh's MRPs are available in two product lines, PolyDyne and MicroDyne. Industries incorporating MRP into their products include tire, automotive, construction, industrial components and consumer products. It is also used as an additive in tires, plastics, asphalt, coatings, and sealants. MRP can also be incorporated into prime or recycled grade polypropylene (PP), high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and nylons. Additionally, the incorporation of MRPs in thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) and thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPV) makes it a feasible ingredient for automotive and building and construction applications.

The particle size distributions of Lehigh's MRP typically range from 830&amp;nbsp;[[µm]] (20 [[mesh (scale)|mesh]]) to 50&amp;nbsp;µm (300 mesh), and its MRP is free of foreign particulates, such as metal and fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Coren|first=Michael J.|title=Tires Are Being Turned Into The Newest Renewable Resource--All It Takes Is Some Freezing And Fine Chopping |url=http://www.fastcoexist.com/1681040/tires-are-being-turned-into-the-newest-renewable-resource-all-it-takes-is-some-freezing-and-|accessdate=15 July 2014|newspaper=Fast Company|date=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third-Generation Technology===
Lehigh claims that its cryogenic turbo mill technology represents an evolution over previous post-manufactured rubber technologies. The most common rubber processing technology converts end-of-life tire and post-industrial rubber material into rubber chips that are typically one inch or larger in size. These chips are then used in tire-derived fuel and civil engineering projects. A second-generation processing technology converts end-of-life tire and rubber material into [[crumb rubber]], also known as ground tire rubber (GTR). GTR typically comprises chips between one inch and 30 mesh in size, with the associated fiber and steel mostly removed. This material is used in asphalt, as garden mulch and in playgrounds.

Because of the material's smaller size, Lehigh markets its micrometer-scale MRP as a third-generation rubber processing technology. MRP's size and composition enables it to be incorporated into advanced and higher-value applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Micronized Rubber Powder|url=http://lehightechnologies.com/index.php/what_we_do/what_is_micronized_rubber_powder|publisher=Lehigh Technologies|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainability==
Lehigh's MRP is used as a compound extender to replace natural rubber and synthetic polymers, as well as to act as a process aid in material production. Lehigh claims that because it replaces commodity-priced rubber- and oil-based feedstocks, MRP can reduce formulation costs. The company has asserted that MRP can offer up to 50 percent cost savings over virgin raw materials in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why use Micronized Rubber Powder|url=http://www.lehightechnologies.com/index.php/what_we_do/why_use_micronized_rubber/|publisher=Lehigh Technologies|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it is derived from end-of-life materials, MRP can also improve the sustainability, and in some cases the performance, of the compounds in which it is used. For example, Lehigh has stated that the smaller particle sizes of MRP increase the impact strength of certain plastic compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Valk|first=Vincent|title=Lehigh Technologies: Specialty chemicals from scrap |url=http://www.chemweek.com/sections/specialty_chemicals/Lehigh-Technologies-Specialty-chemicals-from-scrap_62315.html|accessdate=15 July 2014|newspaper=IHS Chemical Week|date=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in all applications the particle size and loading levels depend on the target application.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8733">In [[mathematics]], '''localization of a category''' consists of adding to a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] inverse [[morphism]]s for some collection of morphisms, constraining them to become [[isomorphism]]s. This is formally similar to the process of [[localization of a ring]]; it in general makes objects isomorphic that were not so before. In [[homotopy theory]], for example, there are many examples of mappings that are invertible [[up to]] homotopy; and so large classes of [[homotopy equivalent]] spaces. '''Calculus of fractions''' is another name for working in a localized category.

==Introduction and motivation==

A [[category (mathematics)|category]] ''C'' consists of objects and [[morphism]]s between these objects. The morphisms reflect relations between the objects. In many situations, it is meaningful to replace ''C'' by another category ''C''' in which certain morphisms are forced to be isomorphisms. This process is called localization.

For example, in the category of ''R''-[[module (mathematics)|modules]] (for some fixed commutative ring ''R'') the multiplication by a fixed element ''r'' of ''R'' is typically (i.e., unless ''r'' is a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]]) not an isomorphism: 
:&lt;math&gt;M \to M \quad m \mapsto r \cdot m.&lt;/math&gt;
The category that is most closely related to ''R''-modules, but where this map ''is'' an isomorphism turns out to be the category of &lt;math&gt;R[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;-modules. Here &lt;math&gt;R[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[localization of a ring|localization]] of ''R'' with respect to the (multiplicatively closed) subset ''S'' consisting of all powers of ''r'',
&lt;math&gt;S = \{ 1, r, r^2, r^3, \dots\}&lt;/math&gt;
The expression "most closely related" is formalized by two conditions: first, there is a [[functor]]
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi: \text{Mod}_R \to \text{Mod}_{R[S^{-1}]} \quad M \mapsto M[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;
sending any ''R''-module to its [[localization of a module|localization]] with respect to ''S''. Moreover, given any category ''C'' and any functor 
:&lt;math&gt;F: \text{Mod}_R \to C&lt;/math&gt;
sending the multiplication map by ''r'' on any ''R''-module (see above) to an isomorphism of ''C'', there is a unique functor
:&lt;math&gt;G: \text{Mod}_{R[S^{-1}]} \to C&lt;/math&gt;
such that &lt;math&gt;F = G \circ \varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

==Localization of categories==
The above examples of localization of ''R''-modules is abstracted in the following definition. In this shape, it applies in many more examples, some of which are sketched below.

Given a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] ''C'' and some class ''W'' of [[morphisms]] in ''C'', the localization ''C''[''W''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;] is another category which is obtained by inverting all the morphisms in ''W''. More formally, it is characterized by a [[universal property]]: there is a natural localization functor ''C'' &amp;rarr; ''C''[''W''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;] and given another category ''D'', a functor ''F'': ''C'' &amp;rarr; ''D'' factors uniquely over ''C''[''W''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;] if and only if ''F'' sends all arrows in ''W'' to isomorphisms.

Thus, the localization of the category is unique, provided that it exists. One construction of the localization is done by declaring that its objects are the same as those in ''C'', but the morphisms are enhanced by adding a formal inverse for each morphism in ''W''. Under suitable hypotheses on ''W'', the morphisms between two objects ''X'', ''Y'' are given by [[span (category theory)|''roofs'']]
:&lt;math&gt;X \stackrel f \leftarrow X' \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;
(where ''X''' is an arbitrary object of ''C'' and ''f'' is in the given class ''W'' of morphisms), modulo certain equivalence relations. These relations turn the map going in the "wrong" direction into an inverse of ''f''. This procedure, however, in general yields a [[proper class]] of morphisms between ''X'' and ''Y''. Typically, the morphisms in a category are only allowed to form a set. Some authors simply ignore such set-theoretic issues.

===Model categories===
A rigorous construction of localization of categories, avoiding these set-theoretic issues, was one of the initial reasons for the development of the theory of [[Model category|model categories]]: a model category ''M'' is a category in which there are three classes of maps; one of these classes is the class of [[weak equivalence (homotopy theory)|weak equivalence]]s. The [[homotopy category]] Ho(''M'') is then the localization with respect to the weak equivalences. The axioms of a model category ensure that this localization can be defined without set-theoretical difficulties.

===Alternative definition===

Some authors also define a ''localization'' of a category ''C'' to be an [[idempotent]] and coaugmented functor. A coaugmented functor is a pair ''(L,l)'' where ''L:C → C'' is an [[endofunctor]] and ''l:Id → L'' is a natural transformation from the identity functor to ''L'' (called the coaugmentation). A coaugmented functor is idempotent if, for every ''X'', both maps ''L(l&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;),l&lt;sub&gt;L(X)&lt;/sub&gt;:L(X) → LL(X)'' are isomorphisms. It can be proven that in this case, both maps are equal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~mitya/idempotents.pdf Idempotents in Monoidal Categories]&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition is related to the one given above as follows: applying the first definition, there is, in many situations, not only a canonical functor &lt;math&gt;C \to C[W^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;, but also a functor in the opposite direction,
:&lt;math&gt;C[W^{-1}] \to C&lt;/math&gt;
For example, modules over the localization &lt;math&gt;R[S^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; of a ring are also modules over ''R'' itself, giving a functor
:&lt;math&gt;R[S^{-1}]-Mod \to R-Mod.&lt;/math&gt;
In this case, the composition
:&lt;math&gt;L : C \to C[W^{-1}] \to C&lt;/math&gt;
is a localization of ''C'' in the sense of an idempotent and coaugmented functor.

==Examples==

===Serre's ''C''-theory===

[[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]] introduced the idea of working in [[homotopy theory]] ''[[Ideal (ring theory)|modulo]]'' some class ''C'' of [[abelian group]]s. This meant that groups ''A'' and ''B'' were treated as isomorphic, if for example ''A/B'' lay in ''C''. Later [[Dennis Sullivan]] had the bold idea instead of using the [[localization of a topological space]], which took effect on the underlying [[topological space]]s.

===Module theory===

In the theory of [[module (mathematics)|module]]s over a [[commutative ring]] ''R'', when ''R'' has [[Krull dimension]] ≥ 2, it can be useful to treat modules ''M'' and ''N'' as ''pseudo-isomorphic'' if ''M/N'' has [[support of a module|support]] of codimension at least two. This idea is much used in [[Iwasawa theory]].

===Derived categories===

The [[derived category]] of an [[abelian category]] is much used in [[homological algebra]]. It is the localization of the category of chain complexes (up to homotopy) with respect to the [[quasi-isomorphism]]s.

===Abelian varieties up to isogeny===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Elliptic curve]] --&gt;

An [[isogeny]] from an [[abelian variety]] ''A'' to another one ''B'' is a surjective morphism with finite [[Kernel (category theory)|kernel]]. Some theorems on abelian varieties require the idea of ''abelian variety up to isogeny'' for their convenient statement. For example, given an abelian subvariety ''A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' of ''A'', there is another subvariety ''A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' of ''A'' such that

:''A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' &amp;times; ''A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''

is ''isogenous'' to ''A'' (Poincaré's theorem: see for example ''Abelian Varieties'' by [[David Mumford]]). To call this a [[direct sum]] decomposition, we should work in the category of abelian varieties up to isogeny.

== Related concepts ==

The [[localization of a topological space]] produces another topological space whose homology is a localization of the homology of the original space.

A much more general concept from [[homotopical algebra]], including as special cases both the localization of spaces and of categories, is the ''[[Bousfield localization]]'' of a [[model category]]. Bousfield localization forces certain maps to become [[weak equivalence (homotopy theory)|weak equivalence]]s, which is in general weaker than forcing them to become isomorphisms.&lt;ref&gt;Philip S. Hirschhorn: ''Model Categories and Their Localizations'', 2003, {{isbn|0-8218-3279-4}}., Definition 3.3.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The movement of animals closely resembles in many ways the [[Brownian motion|random walks of dust particles in a fluid]].&lt;ref name=buchanan&gt;{{cite journal | last=Buchanan | first=Mark | title=Ecological modelling: The mathematical mirror to animal nature | journal=Nature | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=453 | issue=7196 | date=5 June 2008 | issn=0028-0836 | doi=10.1038/453714a | pages=714–716 | pmid=18528368}}&lt;/ref&gt; This similarity led to interest in trying to understand how animals move via the analogy to Brownian motion. This conventional wisdom held until the early 1990s.  However, starting in the late 1980s, evidence began to accumulate that did not fit the theoretical predictions.&lt;ref name=buchanan/&gt;

In 1999, a theoretical investigation of the properties of [[Lévy flight]]s showed that an inverse square distribution of flight times or distances could optimize the search efficiency under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Viswanathan | first=G. M. | last2=Buldyrev | first2=Sergey V. | last3=Havlin | first3=Shlomo | last4=da Luz | first4=M. G. E. | last5=Raposo | first5=E. P. | last6=Stanley | first6=H.

The team of researchers, consisting of Gandhimohan M. Viswanathan, Sergey V. Buldyrev, Marcos Gomes E. da Luz, Shlomo Havlin, Ernesto P. Raposo and H. Eugene Stanley, published these results in 1999 in the journal ''Nature''.

There has been some controversy about the reality of Lévy flight foraging. Early studies were limited to a small range of movement, and thus the type of motion could not be unequivocally determined; and in 2007 flaws were found in a study of wandering albatrosses which was the first empirical example of such a strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Edwards | first=Andrew M. | last2=Phillips | first2=Richard A. | last3=Watkins | first3=Nicholas W. | last4=Freeman | first4=Mervyn P. | last5=Murphy | first5=Eugene J. | last6=Afanasyev | first6=Vsevolod | last7=Buldyrev | first7=Sergey V. | last8=da Luz | first8=M.

'''''Maharat''''' is a Yeshiva located in Bronx, NY, which is the first Orthodox institution in North America to ordain Orthodox women. The word ''maharat'' (מהרת) is a Hebrew acronym for words ''manhiga hilkhatit rukhanit Toranit'' ({{Lang-he-n|מנהיגה הלכתית רוחנית תורנית}}) denoting a female "leader of [[Halakha|Jewish law]] spirituality and [[Torah]]". Maharat, as a clergy title, is awarded with [[smicha|semikha]] to the graduates of a 4-year-long program composed of profound studies of Jewish law, [[Talmud]], [[Torah]], Jewish thought, [[leadership]] training, and pastoral counseling.

==History==
In 2009, Rabbi [[Avi Weiss]] and Rabbi [[Daniel Sperber]] ordained [[Sara Hurwitz]].&lt;ref name="moment"&gt;{{cite news | title=Do 1 Rabba, 2 Rabbis and 1 Yeshiva = a New Denomination?| last= Breger |first=Sarah | date= November–December 2010| work= [[Moment Magazine]] |accessdate= July 31, 2013 | url= http://www.momentmag.com/do-1-rabba-2-rabbis-and-1-yeshiva-a-new-denomination/}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first woman to receive Orthodox [[Semikhah|semikha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://forward.com/opinion/editorial/178571/the-maharat-movement/ |title=The Maharat Movement - Editorial – |publisher=Forward.com |date=2013-06-13 |accessdate=2015-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year Hurwitz and Weiss founded an Orthodox [[yeshiva]] (religious school) for women: ''[http://www.yeshivatmaharat.org/mission-and-history/ Yeshivat Maharat]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://njjewishnews.com/article/8463/we-want-to-place-these-women-in-synagogues|title = We want to place these women in synagogues|date = 2012-02-24|accessdate = 2015-06-30|website = New Jersey Jewish News|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in New York, where Hurwitz serves as President. In 2018-2019, its 10th year, Maharat has graduated 26 women who are serving in clergy roles in synagogues, schools, hospitals, universities and Jewish communal institutions.  There are 31 more students in the pipeline, preparing to change the landscape of Orthodox Judaism and the community at large. Maharat has impacted over 50 communities worldwide.

Graduates of Maharat utilize titles such as ''Maharat'','' Rabba'' (רבה, a neologism), ''Rabbanit'' (רבנית, traditionally denoting a [[Rebbetzin|rabbi's wife]]) and ''Rabbi'' (רבי). In 2015, [[Lila Kagedan]] was ordained as Rabbi by that same organization, making her their first graduate to take the title rabbi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjnews.com/living-jewish/jewish-learning/why-orthodox-judaism-needs-female-rabbis|title=Why Orthodox Judaism needs female rabbis|author=Rabbi Lila Kagedan|date=25 November 2015|website=The Canadian Jewish News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = First female graduate of Orthodox seminary hired by synagogue|url = http://www.jta.org/2016/01/03/news-opinion/united-states/first-u-s-orthodox-woman-to-take-rabbi-title-says-congregation-hired-her|website = Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date = 2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = First female rabbi to lead Orthodox synagogue|url = http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/first-female-rabbi-to-lead-orthodox-synagogue/|website = Jewish Standard|access-date = 2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = New Jersey Orthodox Synagogue Hires Woman Who Uses 'Rabbi' Title|url = http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/news/1.696921|newspaper = Haaretz|date = 2016-01-12|access-date = 2016-01-17|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2015, the [[Rabbinical Council of America]] passed a resolution which states, "RCA members with positions in Orthodox institutions may not ordain women into the Orthodox rabbinate, regardless of the title used; or hire or ratify the hiring of a woman into a rabbinic position at an Orthodox institution; or allow a title implying rabbinic ordination to be used by a teacher of Limudei Kodesh in an Orthodox institution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2015/11/01/news-opinion/united-states/rabbinical-council-of-america-officially-bans-ordination-and-hiring-of-women-rabbis |title=Rabbinical Council of America officially bans ordination and hiring of women rabbis &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Jta.org |date=2015 |accessdate=2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2015, [[Agudath Israel of America]] denounced moves to ordain women, and went even further, declaring Yeshivat Maharat, [[Open Orthodoxy]], [[Yeshivat Chovevei Torah]], and other affiliated entities to be similar to other dissident movements throughout Jewish history in having rejected basic tenets of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hamodia.com/2015/11/03/moetzes-open-orthodoxy-not-a-form-of-torah-judaism/|title=Moetzes: 'Open Orthodoxy' Not a Form of Torah Judaism|website=Hamodia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Breach-in-US-Orthodox-Judaism-grows-as-haredi-body-rejects-Open-Orthodoxy-institutions-431929|title=Breach in US Orthodox Judaism grows as haredi body rejects 'Open Orthodoxy' institutions|website=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/news/323887/agudath-rabbis-declare-war-on-open-orthodoxy/|title=Avi Weiss Defends 'Open Orthodoxy' as Agudah Rabbis Declare War|author=Josh Nathan-Kazis|date=3 November 2015|website=The Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Avi Weiss has continuously tried to advocate for the right for female clergy to use the rabbi title. In protest of those denying this right to women, Weiss resigned from the [[Rabbinical Council of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rabbi Avi Weiss quits Rabbinical Council of America in protest - Jewish World News|url = http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/1.663608|accessdate = 2015-06-30|first = |last = JTA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newly minted female Orthodox rabbis  to be called 'rabba' - Jewish World News|url = http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.660857}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = In protest, Avi Weiss quits Rabbinical Council of America|url = http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-protest-avi-weiss-quits-rabbinical-council-of-america/|accessdate = 2015-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Avi Weiss Quits Rabbinic Group in Flap Over School - Breaking News|url = http://forward.com/news/breaking-news/311099/avi-weiss-quits-rabbinic-group-in-flap-over-school/|accessdate = 2015-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Takolander is the author of five books: a collection of short stories, ''The Double'' (Text, 2013);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://textpublishing.com.au/books-and-authors/book/the-double/ |title=The Double: (And Other Stories), book by Maria Takolander — Text Publishing |website=Textpublishing.com.au |date=2013-08-21 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; a book of literary criticism, ''Catching Butterflies: Bringing Magical Realism to Ground'' (Peter Lang, 2007); and three collections of poems, ''The End of the World''(Giramondo, 2014),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giramondopublishing.com/category/maria-takolander/ |title=Giramondo PublishingMaria Takolander Archives |publisher=Giramondo Publishing |date=2013-11-25 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ghostly Subjects'' (Salt, 2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.saltpublishing.com/shop/proddetail.php?prod=9781844713400 |title=Ghostly Subjects, Maria Takolander - Salt |website=Saltpublishing.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Narcissism'' (Whitmore Press, 2005). 

Takolander won the inaugural 2010 ''Australian Book Review'' Elizabeth Jolley short story competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.australianbookreview.com.au/component/k2/45-december-2010-january-2011/190-abr-short-story-competition-winner |title=Jolley Prize 2010 (Winner): 'A Roānkin philosophy of poetry' by Maria Takolander |website=Australianbookreview.com.au |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201000612/https://www.australianbookreview.com.au/component/k2/45-december-2010-january-2011/190-abr-short-story-competition-winner |archivedate=1 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was awarded a 2011-12 Australia Council New Work grant to complete a subsequent book of short stories, ''The Double''. Her poetry collection ''Ghostly Subjects'' was short-listed for a 2010 Queensland Premier's Literary Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Middlemiss |first=Perry |url=http://www.middlemiss.org/matilda/2010/08/2010-queensland-premiers-literary-awards-shortlists.html |title=2010 Queensland Premier's Literary Awards Shortlists - Matilda |website=Middlemiss.org |date=2010-08-23 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also been awarded a 2014-2015 Australia Council New Work grant to complete a novel for Text Publishing.

Takolander's short stories, poems and essays have been widely published in Australian journals and newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deakin.edu.au/research/admin/pubs/reports/database/dynamic/output/person/person.php?person_code=takolma]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906174533/http://www.deakin.edu.au/research/admin/pubs/reports/database/dynamic/output/person/person.php?person_code=takolma |date=6 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her poems have also been featured in ''The Best Australian Poems 2005'' (Black Inc), ''The Best Australian Poetry 2006'' (UQP), ''The Best Australian Poems 2007'' (Black Inc), ''The Best Australian Poems 2008'' (Black Inc), ''The Best Australian Poems 2009'' (Black Inc), ''The Best Australian Poetry 2009'' (UQP), ''The Best Australian Poems 2010'' (Black Inc), ''The Best Australian Poems 2011'' (Black Inc), ''The Best Australian Poems 2012'' (Black Inc), ''The Best Australian Poems 2013'' (Black Inc) and ''The Best Australian Poems 2014'' (Black Inc). Her poetry is also included in the 2011 anthology ''Thirty Australian Poets'' (UQP) and in the 2014 anthology ''The turnrow Anthology of Contemporary Australian Poetry'' (Turnrow).

Takolander is married to the Australian poet and critic [[David McCooey]].

Bronwyn Lea has written of Takolander's poetry: "Takolander’s poems are ruinous, diabolical, all the more so for their polish and precision. Here, as in Baudelaire, beauty is inextricably linked with evil: it’s 'the dark italics', as Wallace Stevens phrased it, that compels the poetic imagination in these poems … Don’t be surprised if they take up residence in your body after reading them … it’s just that kind of book."

Geordie Williamson, the chief literary critic at ''The Australian'', has written of ''The Double'': "Takolander, though immured in the same darkling stuff as Plath, always remains in command. Hers are a series of thought experiments in which enduring Western narratives are recast according to the author's imaginative and philosophical inclinations. The results are fiercely intelligent and idiosyncratic, sometimes shot through with black humour, sometimes pressing down on the reader with the full weight of human horror...Individually, Takolander's stories can be bleak. But collectively they are thrilling. Slender as this collection may be, it announces the arrival of a considerable talent.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/tales-of-the-unexpected-in-maria-takolanders-the-double/story-fn9n8gph-1226698293033 |title=Tales of the Unexpected in Maria Takolander's the Double|publisher=The Australian |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meltwater management''' is a runoff management system designed to deal with runoff caused by the melting of snow in colder climates. They were designed when it became apparent that using the [[Best management practice for water pollution|Best management practice]] (BMP) for rainfall runoff was not working.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stormwater.pca.state.mn.us/index.php/Cold_climate_impact_on_runoff_management|title=Cold climate impact on runoff management - Minnesota Stormwater Manual|website=stormwater.pca.state.mn.us|language=en|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Snow filtration''' is a system to deal with left-over [[snow]] in an [[environmentally friendly]] way. Removing snow from roads is done to ensure [[road safety]]. The conventional method is by removing the snow and emptying it into rivers. However, since salt is used to melt ice on the roads, the salt also enters the rivers with the dumped snow. This increases the salt content of the rivers which can have impacts on aquatic and marine ecosystems. The practice of removing snow from streets and off-loading it into rivers affects the aquatic ecosystems. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindsay|first1=Jay|title=Dump Snow in Rivers, Harbors? There's a Downside.|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/41427190/ns/us_news-environment/t/dump-snow-rivers-harbors-theres-downside/#.WQzRIcm1uRs|website=NBCNews|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
In spring as snow melts, the salt used on roads as a deicer is left behind, which can be environmentally damaging as it creates a [[Tonicity#Hypertonicity|hypertonic]] environment for plants.

The snow [[Surface runoff|runoff]] is collected and brought to a collection center. It is directed through an oil and grit separator which also monitors the consistency of pollutants in the runoff. The oil and grit separator causes [[electrochemical]] and [[biological process|biological]] processes, which bind [[heavy metals]] and [[nutrients]] to the sediment by means of [[redox|
reduction-oxidation]] reactions. At the same time, this reduces the amount of [[chlorine]] present in the runoff. 

The runoff then flows into a [[catch basin]], where plants use the salt [[ions]] (e.g. [[Potassium|K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Phosphorus|P&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Nitrogen|N&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;]]) for their growth.The runoff is further filtered by the plants, leaving only clean water to go back into [[streams]] and [[river]]s.&lt;!-- Plagiarism --&gt;

'''Pantsing''', also known as '''depantsing''', ''' flagging''', or '''debagging''', is the pulling down of a person's trousers or underwear, usually against their wishes, and typically as a [[practical joke]] or a form of [[bullying]], but in other instances as a [[sexual fetish]]. The most common method is to sneak up behind the intended victim, grab the trousers at the waist, and apply a quick downward tug before the victim is aware of the assailant's presence.

Pantsing is a common type of prank or bullying in school gym classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oAFlDy4-3pkC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=depantsing&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=depantsing&amp;f=false |last=Roberts |first=Walter B. |title=Bullying from Both Sides: Strategic Interventions for Working With Bullies &amp; Victims |publisher=Corwin Press |date=2005 |pages=84–85 |isbn=1-4129-2580-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JUyqzGlx0gAC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=depantsing&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=depantsing&amp;f=false |last=Voors |first=William |title=The Parent's Book About Bullying: Changing the Course of Your Child's Life |publisher=Hazelden |date=2000 |page=6 |ISBN=978-1-56838-517-4 |access-date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its most extreme form includes running the trousers up the school flagpole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uoXKtfx4weoC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=depantsing&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=depantsing&amp;f=false |last1=Cunningham |first1=Patricia |last2=Lab |first2=Susan |title=Dress and Popular Culture |publisher=Popular Press |date=1991 |page=120 |ISBN=978-0-87972-507-5 |access-date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some U.S. colleges before [[World War II]] were the scenes of large-scale "depantsing" scraps between freshman and sophomore males, often involving more than 2,000 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://digitalnewspapers.libraries.psu.edu/Default/Skins/BasicArch/Client.asp?Skin=BasicArch&amp;&amp;Appname=2%2525252525252526amp%252525252525253Benter%252525252525253Dtrue%2525252525252526amp%252525252525253BBaseHref%252525252525253DDCG%252525252525252F1950%252525252525252F09%252525252525252F13%2525252525252526amp%252525252525253BEntityId%252525252525253DAr00100 |title=Customs Were Rugged Then |work=[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]] |date=13 September 1950 |volume=51 |issue=2 |page=1 |access-date=25 August 2009 |via=DigitalNewspaper.Libraries.PSU.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an initiation rite in fraternities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4htx62wIXIgC&amp;pg=PT177&amp;dq=depantsing&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=depantsing&amp;f=false] |last1=Hodapp |first1=Christopher |last2=Von Kannon |first2=Alice |title=Conspiracy Theories &amp; Secret Societies for Dummies |publisher=Wiley |date=2008 |page=159 |ISBN=978-0-470-18408-0 |access-date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and seminaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MUYn5ydZ_HwC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=depantsing&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=depantsing&amp;f=false |last=Jordan |first=Mark D. |title=The Silence of Sodom: Homosexuality in Modern Catholicism |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=2002 |page=164 |ISBN=978-0-226-41043-2 |access-date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was cited in 1971 by [[Gail Sheehy]] as a form of [[assault]] against grade school girls, which did not commonly get reported, although it might include improper touching and [[indecent exposure]] by the perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B-MCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=depantsing&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=pantsing&amp;f=false |last=Sheehy |first=Gail |title=Nice girls don't get into trouble |work=[[New York Magazine]] |date=15 February 1971 |page=28 |access-date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States legal system has prosecuted it as a form of [[sexual harassment]] of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-ym-Zjn9-zQC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=depantsing&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=depantsing&amp;f=false |last=Martinson |first=Floyd Mansfield |title=The Sexual Life of Children |publisher=Bergin &amp; Garvey |date=1994 |page=136 |ISBN=978-0-89789-376-3 |access-date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative names ==
In Britain, especially historically at [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] Universities in [[England]], the term is known as ''debagging'' (derived from [[Oxford bags]], a loose-fitting baggy form of trousers).

A corresponding term in [[Australia]] (aside from ''pantsing'') is ''dakking'', ''dacking'', or ''daxing'', which originated from [[Simpsons of Piccadilly|DAKS Simpson]], a clothing brand that became a [[Generic brand|generic term]] for pants and underwear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com.au/dictionaries/wotm/dak |publisher=Oxford University Press |title=Word of the Month: The Making of Australian English – Dak |work=OUP.com |date=2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101229091521/http://www.oup.com.au/dictionaries/wotm/dak |archive-date=29 December 2010 |dead-url=yes |access-date=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McClure |first=Geoff |url= http://www.theage.com.au/news/sport/campo-point-of-view-gets-a-makeover/2006/02/15/1139890806854.html |title=Campo 'point' of view gets a makeover |work=[[The Age]] |date=16 February 2006 |access-date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''double-dacking'' is used when both the pants and underwear are pulled down. In [[Scotland]] the process is often known as ''breeking'' or ''breekexxing'' from the word ''breeks'' meaning 'trousers'. In [[New Zealand]] the act is known as giving someone a ''down-trou'' or ''drou'' (though this can have [[Glossary of cue sports terms#down-trou|a more specific meaning]], relating to loser-shaming in [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]] playing and other competitive games); in Ireland, it is ''jocking'', ''zoonking'' or ''ka-blinking''; in the north of England ''kegging'' (or ''quegging'').{{citation needed|date=November 2017|reason=All these need citations; some of these do not seem plausible, e.g. "breekexxing" isn't normal English orthography.}}

An alternative term is ''sharking'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Higgins |title=Fourth charge put to Lisburn teen accused of sexual assault by 'sharking' |work=[[Belfast Telegraph]] |date=2 October 2015 |url= https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/fourth-charge-put-to-lisburn-teen-accused-of-sexual-assault-by-sharking-31576647.html |access-date=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which usually implies a [[sexual assault]] on a stranger rather than a prank or bullying between peers, and is sometimes applied more broadly to the pulling down of blouses and other top clothing.

==Bullying==
Pantsing can be used as a form of [[bullying]] and is technically the crime of [[assault|simple assault]]. The practice has been viewed as a form of ritual emasculation. In 2007, British [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills]] [[Alan Johnson]], in a speech to the [[National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers]], criticized such bullying and criticized [[YouTube]] for hosting a movie (since removed) of a teacher being pantsed, saying that such bullying "is causing some [teachers] to consider leaving the profession because of the [[defamation]] and [[humiliation]] they are forced to suffer" and that "Without the online approval which appeals to the innate insecurities of the bully, such sinister activities would have much less attraction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://watfordobserver.co.uk./news/localnews/display.var.1324861.0.youtube_condemned_by_minister.php|title=Youtube condemned by minister|date=12 April 2007|work=The Watford Observer|publisher=Newsquest Media Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://people.broadcastnewsroom.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=126198|title=British education minister warns malicious online videos hurting teachers|date=10 April 2007|work=Broadcast Newsroom|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/education/article2445862.ece |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120731155612/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/education/article2445862.ece |dead-url=yes |archive-date=31 July 2012 |title=Teachers are devastated by pupils' net effects |date=13 April 2007 |work=Belfast Telegraph |publisher=Independent News &amp; Media }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juanita Ross Epp is highly critical of teachers who regard pupils pantsing one another as normal behavior, saying that pantsing makes pupils feel intimidated and uncomfortable and that "normal is not the same as right".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Systematic Violence: How Schools Hurt Children|editor=Juanita Ross Epp and Ailsa M. Watkinson|author=Juanita Ross Epp|chapter=Schools, Complicity, and Sources of Violence|page=17|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|ISBN=0-7507-0582-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Focus populations==
Pantsing occurs most often in school. Girls may collude with dominant boys in targeting weaker boys, and may also single out certain boys that do not share attributes with the dominant male group without the help or instigation of boys.&lt;ref name=Duncan&gt;{{cite book|title=Sexual Bullying: Gender Conflict and Pupil Culture in Secondary Schools|author=Neil Duncan|pages=21&amp;ndash;32|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-19113-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bottom rank hen.JPG|thumb|Bottom rank hen showing feather damage as a result of pecking]]
'''Pecking order''' or '''peck order''' is the [[colloquial]] term for the [[Hierarchical organization|hierarchical system of social organization]]. It was first described by [[Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe]] in 1921 under the German terms ''Hackordnung'' or ''Hackliste'' and introduced into English in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Perrin, P.G., (1955). Pecking order 1927-54. American Speech, 30(4): 265-268&lt;/ref&gt;

The original use of ''pecking order'' referred to the expression of dominance in [[chickens]]. Dominance in chickens is asserted by various behaviours, including [[pecking]], which was used by Schjelderup-Ebbe as a measure of dominance and leadership order. In his 1924 German-language article, he noted that "defense and aggression in the hen is accomplished with the [[beak]]".&lt;ref&gt;Schjelderup-Ebbe, 1975 p. 36 cited in Rajecki, D.W. (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;  This emphasis on pecking led many subsequent studies on fowl behaviour to use it as a primary observation, however, it has been noted that [[rooster]]s tend to leap and use their claws in conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Rajecki, D.W. (1988). Formation of leap orders in pairs of male domestic chickens. Aggressive Behavior, 14(6): 425-436&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[dominance hierarchy]]'' is often used for this type of social organisation in other animals.

Pecking order is a basic concept in [[social stratification]] and [[social hierarchy]] that has its counterparts in other [[animal]] [[species]], including [[humans]], although the term "pecking order" is often used synonymously.

== Biological theories ==

===Function===
The ultimate function of a pecking order is to increase the [[Fitness (biology)|individual]] or [[inclusive fitness]] of the animals involved in its formation.  Fighting to acquire resources such as food and mates is expensive in terms of time, energy and the risk of injury.  By developing a pecking order, animals determine which individuals will get priority of access to resources, particularly when they are limited; there is a reduction in aggression when a pecking order has been developed.  Therefore, the proximate functions of a pecking order are to reduce the costs of time, energy and risk of injury incurred during resource acquisition and defence.

===Mechanism===
The basic concept behind the establishment of the pecking order among, for example, [[chickens]], is that it is necessary to determine who is the 'top chicken,' the 'bottom chicken' and where all the rest fit in between. The establishment of the dominance hierarchy may reduce the incidence of conflict and thus reduce the expenditure of energy required for aggressive competition.  The dominance level determines which individual gets preferential access to resources such as food and mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biology: An Introduction|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|page=157|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FXsfY35kLkQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{circular-inline|date=August 2016}}

In the wild, pecking order status is inherited along a strict basis, so that the first daughter of the most dominant chicken will inherit that most dominant status, the second most dominant will give second most dominant status to her daughter, etc. unless the most dominant chicken has a second daughter, in which case that chicken will become the second most dominant.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Studies of the genetic basis of pecking orders in chickens have indicated that it may largely be determined by the coloration patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media| people = Robert Sapolsky| title = Behavioral Genetics I (Human Behavioral Biology)| publisher = Stanford University| date = April 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not necessary for animals to be able to recognise individuals within the group for a pecking order to be maintained.  Animal behaviours may be motivated by  "[[rule of thumb]]".  For example, if chickens can predict the fighting ability of others simply by assessing their body size, they will be able to maintain the hierarchy whilst avoiding a fight which could cause injury and will be energetically costly.  Using this rule of thumb, if Chicken A sees that Chicken B is larger, Chicken A will defer; if Chicken B is smaller, it will defer to Chicken A.  In this way, only chickens of similar sizes will fight and the pecking order of the group overall is maintained without requiring individual recognition.

Wild and feral chickens form relatively small groups, usually including no more than 10 to 20 individuals. It has been shown that in larger groups, which is common in farming, the dominance hierarchy becomes less stable and aggression increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title = Aggressive behavior of chickens: Some effects of social and physical environments | conference = 27th Annual National Breeder's Roundtable | date = 11 May 1978 | first = J.V. | last = Craig | url = http://www.poultryscience.org/docs/pba/1952-2003/1978/1978%20Craig.pdf | location = Kansas City, KS, US | accessdate = 2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25754">'''Public Service Motivation''' ('''PSM''') is an attribute of government and non-governmental organization ([[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]) employment that explains why individuals have a desire to serve the public and link their personal actions with the overall public interest. Understanding the theory and practice of PSM is important in determining the motivations of individuals who choose careers in the government and non-profit sectors despite the potential for more financially lucrative careers in the private sector.

== Common Models  ==
=== How Public Service Motivation (PSM) is Used  ===
PSM helps employees get the most out of their job experience and is rapidly evolving to work towards employee goals and company needs effectively. Efforts to manage employee behavior within government organizations by focusing on financial rewards may not have the desired effect and could potentially have a negative impact on employee motivation and performance seeing as how those that do work in the public sector are usually not motivated by financial gain. According to Perry, PSM in today's society is more about focusing on employee commitment to an organization rather than benefits of a higher salary. One way PSM output can be measured is by team performance which encourages individuals to engage in behaviors that are best for the team’s success and productivity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GOTTFREDSON|first1=R. K |title=How to get YOUR TEAMS to work |journal=Industrial Management|date=2015 |volume=57 |issue=4 |page=28 in pages 25–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance can be measured in different categories and various outcomes can be utilized in order to help the organization set goals and interpret the results to tweak their motivational techniques. One area or aspect of management that relies heavily on motivation is when an organization or company determines how to distribute rewards to employees. Gottfredson emphasized that rewards may be the most important tool that business leaders have to coordinate and motivate team members&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; with the idea that rewards can be monetary or promotional, but motivation plays a key part in how hard employees will work to receive rewards.

=== Perry’s Public Service Motivation Scale ===
Public Service Motivation serves to provide the general public with an idea of what motivates individuals to choose career paths within the public sector as opposed to the private. Previous research emphasized that PSM was influenced by various social and political factors that ultimately drive employees to take an interest in the public sector. The history and concept of public service motivation has been studied by authors who contributed to the understanding of the practice itself such as Perry and Wise who coined the term PSM in 1990, and other political figures such as Woodrow Wilson who founded the field of Public Administration. Perry and Wise stated that PSM is often influenced by various social, political, and institutional factors and failure on the organization's part to recognize the motivation of its employees could lead to the discouragement of such individuals from the public sector.

=== Mission Valence ===
Mission Valence can be viewed as an employee’s perception of the attractiveness or salience of an organization’s purpose or social contribution.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=dd80fc18-7fce-4698-aeb3-a60b2afd4d8b%40sessionmgr4003&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=4105|title = Pulling the Levers: Transformational Leadership, Public Service Motivation, and Mission Valence|last = Wright, Bradley E., Moynihan, Donald P., Pandey, Sanjay K.|date = March–April 2012|journal = Public Administration Review. Vol. 72 Issue 2, P206-215. 10p. 1 Diagram, 1 Chart.|volume = 72|issue = 2|pages = 206–215|doi = 10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02496.x|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mission Valence is a concept formulated by Rainey and Steinbauer in 1999 that serves to provide a better understanding of what compels an employee to uphold and achieve goals within their organization. Mission Valence enhances the satisfaction that an individual experiences or anticipates to receive from advancing the organizational mission, and in turn, it has the "potential to influence the ability of the organization to recruit, retain, and motivate its employees."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ultimately, linking the organization’s mission to the values and characteristics of the employee can increase the potential effects of PSM as members of the organization become committed to its success. Rainey and Steinbauer attribute mission valence to enhancing the satisfaction of an employee when the organization’s mission or goal is achieved thus giving the employer the ability to motivate his or her employees and seek their retention. With the desire to help others, public employees are more likely to seek employment within a public organization because the particular mission of that organization often aligns with their own personal values. Previous studies enhance the notion that leadership along with effective management can increase employee mission valence through its ability to promote public service motivation.

=== Transformational Leadership ===
{{Main|Transformational leadership}}
Transformational leadership moves away from a traditional management perspective that is based on self-interest and the exchanging of rewards for positive performance, and instead proposes the ideology of value based leadership to inspire and thus motivate employees. Although value based leadership is not new to the scope of public management, it is important to understand the evolution of how employers communicate the vision of the organization’s purpose to their employees. Transformational leadership can motivate employees by appealing to their ideals and moral values, which in turn leads to a more effective and meaningful work environment. Transformational leaders create shared organizational value through "inspirational communication, ongoing practices, setting meaningful goals and designating significant work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=97a0cead-a156-46fe-91ed-29d496d045a5%40sessionmgr4001&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=4105|title = Transformational Leadership and Public Service Motivation: Driving Individual and Organizational Performance |last = Paarlberg Laurie E, Lavigna, Bob |date = September–October 2010|journal = Public Administration Review.

=== The Role of Organizations in Promoting PSM ===
The impact of organizational institutions can either have a positive or negative ramifications on the motivational attitude of employees. According to Perry and Wise, whose theories contributed to the understanding of the ongoing relationship between one's overall motivation and the public interest, provided the widely accepted definition of PSM as an individual’s "predisposition to respond to motives grounded primarily or uniquely in public institutions and organizations."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=ddcb9dec-7de2-4c7e-81a6-b93e2e097e66%40sessionmgr110&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=114|title = The Role of Organizations in Fostering Public Service Motivation|last = Moynihan, Donald P., Pandey, Sanjay K.|date = January–February 2007|journal = Public Administration Review, 1/1/2007, Vol. 67, Issue 1, P. 40-53|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this definition, organizations have the duty and responsibility to foster an environment that allows employees to feel as if they are able to contribute to the general welfare of the public and can achieve their goals. Various scholars and researchers emphasize the role of organizations as an important aspect of PSM and indicate several factors that face employees on a regular basis that could either promote or hinder PSM. Perry and Wise specify those factors of an organization that influence PSM to include culture within an organization which can negatively be associated with PSM as hierarchical cultures tend to emphasize rule-based control of employees and bureaucratic personality,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; employees that experience red tape who often are characterized with lower levels of PSM as red tape includes rules regulations, and procedures that remain in force and entail a compliance burden, but do not advance the legitimate purposes the rules were intended to serve.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Employees who had a lower level of job satisfaction were reported as more willing to tolerate red tape as opposed to those employees characterized with higher levels of PSM who were frustrated with the limitations of such constrictions. Educational level of organizational members reportedly had a positive relationship on the overall level of PSM of the individual. Wright, Pandey, and Moynihan emphasize that it is vital that organizational leaders understand the various factors that affect PSM in order help employees achieve their goals within the organization and provide for a better work environment.

Studies by Homberg, McCarthy, and Tabvuma attribute PSM to the positive impact on job satisfaction in the public sector because public employment helps satisfy individuals’ pro-social needs.&lt;ref&gt;Homberg, F., McCarthy, D. and Tabvuma, V. (2015), A Meta-Analysis of the Relationship between Public Service Motivation and Job Satisfaction. Public Administration Review, 75: 711–722 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/puar.12423/abstract&lt;/ref&gt; Previous authors that are familiar with motivational factors associated with the public sector suggests that many employees tend to characterize themselves with pro-social identities such as caring and compassionate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An integrative analytical framework for understanding the effects of autonomous and controlled motivation|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886915001579|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|date = 2015-10-01|pages = 2–15|volume = 84|series = Theory and Measurement in Personality and Individual Differences|doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2015.02.034|first = Jennifer|last = Brunet|first2 = Katie E.|last2 = Gunnell|first3 = Patrick|last3 = Gaudreau|first4 = Catherine M.|last4 = Sabiston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers of motivational theory and management emphasize that individuals will go above and beyond to be viewed as "moral" or good by their peers and fellow employees, so finding pro-social ways to motivate individuals can be beneficial.

Crewson argued that a responsive and cost-effective government should acknowledge that a failure to properly understand the motivations of public employees may have undesirable short term effects such as low job performance which may lead to long term effects such as the permanent displacement of the public service ethic.&lt;ref name="Crewson1997"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Philip E.

Rosenblatt noted that there is a surprising link between PSM and motivation. After closely observing employees in the public section, material indicated that when PSM encourages individuals it can spark innovation. When employees are rewarded for previous accomplishments in the workplace, they are motivated to do even more, although that motivation is not necessarily coming from a genuine place and instead comes from the desire to receive more rewards. Rosenblatt reaffirms the notion that individuals aren't to concern themselves with what their driving force for may be, whether they are making accomplishments because they want to be innovative or because they want to receive a bonus, the ends will ultimately justify the means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The use of innovation awards in the public sector: individual and organizational perspectives|last = Rosenblatt|first = Michael|date = 2011|journal = Innovation : Management, Policy, &amp; Practice|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors ===
Matei and Cornea considered that although intrinsic, PSM is influenced by a variety of external factors such as social, political, institutional etc. and, in time, those factors can have an effect and lead to a change in the initial PSM of the individual that was present at the beginning of the position. Such factors demonstrate that if the external factors that act on the public servant are negative, PSM will influence the behavior of the individual for a period of time that is smaller than the professional career of that individual. If the extrinsic factors are positive, PSM can influence the behavior of the public servant throughout their entire career. Matei and Cornea concluded that during this period of time, when PSM influences the activity of the individual, the public servant is led by a certain “lyricism of public service", and connected to their job by “administrative romanticism" with the ultimate desire to serve their community, state, nation etc.&lt;ref name="Matei"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Matei, L.  |author2=Cornea, I.

Mann also conducted a study among non profit employees and came to the conclusion that although there is a dichotomy within the public and private sectors, if an employee is working for a non profit organization he or she would be satisfied regardless of PSM or not. The reason behind this behavior is because employees who work for non profits already have a passion for the work that they do. According to Mann's study, even if these individuals didn't receive compensation, they would return to work the next day and work just as hard because they have intrinsic motivation that doesn't need to be externalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A motive to serve: Public service motivation in human resource management and the role of PSM in the nonprofit sector|last = Mann|first = Gregory|date = Oct 9, 2015|journal = Public Personnel Management|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous scholars and researchers warn that PSM can also be influenced by negative factors such as institutionalized values, routinization of behaviors&lt;ref name="Downs"&gt;{{Citation|author=Downs, Anthony |year=1964 |title=Inside bureaucracy |publisher=Rand Corporation|url=http://130.154.3.8/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2008/P2963.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150422153429/http://130.154.3.8/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2008/P2963.pdf |archivedate=22 April 2015 |deadurl=no}}, later republished in a modifies form in 1967 by Little, Brown and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Moynihan, Donald P. |author2=Pandey, Sanjay K.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007 |title=The role of organizations in fostering public service motivation |journal=Public Administration Review |volume=67 |issue=1 |pages=40–53 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00695.x |url=https://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/images/publications/facstaff/moynihan/PAR67role.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309080236/http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/images/publications/facstaff/moynihan/PAR67role.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and skepticism about the value of the particular bureaucracy's effectiveness in promoting the public good.&lt;ref name="Kelman" /&gt; Budget maximization and "empire building"  were also scrutinized by Downs&lt;ref name="Downs" /&gt; and Niskanen.&lt;ref name="Niskanen"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Niskanen, William A. |year=1971 |title=Bureaucracy and representative government|location=Chicago|publisher=Aldine (Atherton) }}, reprinted in 2007 by Aldine Transaction.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|2008|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and Alternatives ==
=== Leadership Practices ===
The agency's mission, goals, and objectives can help improve employee performance and motivation. Many employees who hold jobs within the public sector and non-profit organizations do not receive large salaries. It is important for an organization to motivate its employees and align their values and characteristics with the mission and values of the agency rather than subject employees to a stressful and hostile work environment motivated by financial gain. Leadership practices should emphasize to employees the importance of motivation and involvement which can ultimately help the agency or organization in the hiring and retention process if they are aware of the motives of their employees.

=== Surface Acting ===
Studies performed by various researchers attribute an individual's motivation with the individual level of stress and job dissatisfaction. These factors can lead to surface acting which is characterized by adjusting observable emotional expressions to mask true feelings, pretending to feel a desired emotion, and faking emotional displays. It is hard to evaluate the motivation of each individual working in the public sector when they exhibit a false persona. Representing an agency or organization in the public sector often requires one to display and act in a certain behavior and attitude. This behavior often leads to surface acting.

=== Emotional Labor ===
Situational factors such as the frequency of customer interactions, the duration of such interactions, career fields, customer hostility, and organizational expectations can all contribute to one's [[emotional labor]]. Emotional labor is the act of behaving or displaying specific emotions and behaviors within one's job profession. Employees are constantly under the influence of interactions between other employees and customers. Many citizens expect a certain level of satisfaction from each level of government which often burdens the employee with an immense amount of pressure to fulfill those expectations and who in turn will often face backlash and harsh criticism when citizens feel they are not satisfied.

=== Employment Relationship ===
If an employee finds themselves in a hostile, stressful work environment this can deter motivation and counteract productivity which can ultimately effect the individuals  goals, expectations, and disrupt the balance of the workplace. Motivation stems from an individuals desire to satisfy the needs for automaton, direct communication between employees, and asocial inclusions. Having an open approach in the workplace can help new less experienced employees feel a sense of involvement and value which an ultimately increase their motivation to succeed and continue with the organization and vie for its success. As generational changes continue to occur and public sector employees rotate between positions, it is vital to understand how employment relationships can be improved in order to increase public service motivation. Nonprofit employees are becoming more similar to public employees based on motivational aspects such as intrinsic rewards.

{{evolutionary biology}}

'''Punctuated equilibrium''' (also called '''punctuated equilibria''') is a theory in [[evolution|evolutionary biology]] which proposes that once [[species]] appear in the [[fossil record]] the population will become stable, showing little evolutionary change for most of its geological history.&lt;ref name="pe1972"&gt;Eldredge, Niles and S. J. Gould (1972). [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/eldredge.asp "Punctuated equilibria: an alternative to phyletic gradualism"] In T.J.M. Schopf, ed., ''Models in Paleobiology''. San Francisco: Freeman Cooper. pp. 82-115. Reprinted in N. Eldredge ''Time frames''. Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1985, pp. 193-223. ([http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/handle/2246/6564 2nd draft], [http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/handle/2246/6567 3rd final draft], [http://www.somosbacteriasyvirus.com/phyletic.pdf Published draft])&lt;/ref&gt; This state of little or no morphological change is called ''stasis''. When significant evolutionary change occurs, the theory proposes that it is generally restricted to rare and [[geologic time scale|geologically rapid]] events of branching speciation called [[cladogenesis]]. Cladogenesis is the process by which a species splits into two distinct species, rather than one species gradually transforming into another.&lt;ref name=Gould&amp;Eldredge1977&gt;Gould, Stephen Jay, &amp; Eldredge, Niles (1977). [http://www.johnboccio.com/courses/SOC26/Bak-Sneppan/07_Gould.pdf "Punctuated equilibria: the tempo and mode of evolution reconsidered."] ''Paleobiology'' '''3''' (2): 115-151. (p.145)&lt;/ref&gt;

Punctuated equilibrium is commonly contrasted against [[phyletic gradualism]], the idea that evolution generally occurs uniformly and by the steady and gradual transformation of whole lineages (called [[anagenesis]]). In this view, evolution is seen as generally smooth and continuous.&lt;ref name="GouldNewScientist"&gt;Gould, S. J.

In 1972, paleontologists [[Niles Eldredge]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]] published a landmark paper developing their theory and called it ''punctuated equilibria''.&lt;ref name="pe1972"/&gt;  Their paper built upon [[Ernst Mayr]]'s model of [[allopatric speciation|geographic speciation]],&lt;ref name=Mayr1954&gt;Mayr, Ernst (1954).

==History==
Punctuated equilibrium originated as a logical consequence of [[Ernst Mayr]]'s concept of [[Founder effect|genetic revolutions]] by [[allopatric speciation|allopatric]] and especially [[peripatric speciation]] as applied to the fossil record. Although the sudden appearance of species and its relationship to speciation was proposed and identified by Mayr in 1954,&lt;ref name=Mayr1954 /&gt; [[history of science|historians of science]] generally recognize the 1972 Eldredge and Gould paper as the basis of the new [[paleobiology|paleobiological]] research program.&lt;ref name="Mayr1992"&gt;[[Ernst Mayr|Mayr, Ernst]] (1992).

New York: Columbia University Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;78–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Punctuated equilibrium differs from Mayr's ideas mainly in that Eldredge and Gould placed considerably greater emphasis on stasis, whereas Mayr was concerned with explaining the [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] discontinuity (or "sudden jumps")&lt;ref&gt;Schindewolf, Otto (1936). ''Paldontologie, Entwicklungslehre und Genetik''. Berlin: Borntraeger.&lt;/ref&gt; found in the fossil record.&lt;ref name="Mayr1992"/&gt; Mayr later complimented Eldredge and Gould's paper, stating that evolutionary stasis had been "unexpected by most evolutionary biologists" and that punctuated equilibrium "had a major impact on paleontology and evolutionary biology."&lt;ref name=Mayr1992 /&gt;

A year before their 1972 Eldredge and Gould paper, [[Niles Eldredge]] published a paper in the journal ''[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]'' which suggested that gradual evolution was seldom seen in the fossil record and argued that Ernst Mayr's standard mechanism of [[allopatric speciation]] might suggest a possible resolution.&lt;ref name=eldredge1971 /&gt;

The Eldredge and Gould paper was presented at the [[Geological Society of America|Annual Meeting of the Geological Society of America]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=pe1972/&gt; The symposium focused its attention on how modern [[microevolution]]ary studies could revitalize various aspects of paleontology and macroevolution. Tom Schopf, who organized that year's meeting, assigned Gould the topic of speciation. Gould recalls that "Eldredge's 1971 publication [on [[Paleozoic]] [[trilobite]]s] had presented the only new and interesting ideas on the paleontological implications of the subject—so I asked Schopf if we could present the paper jointly."&lt;ref name="StructureofEvolutionaryTheory"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gould |first= S.

I coined the term ''punctuated equilibrium'' and wrote most of our 1972 paper, but Niles is the proper first author in our pairing of Eldredge and Gould."&lt;ref name=Opus200&gt;Gould, S. J. (1991).

Some of the parts that would seem obviously the work of one of us were actually first penned by the other—I remember for example, writing the section on Gould's snails. Other parts are harder to reconstruct. Gould edited the entire manuscript for better consistency. We sent it in, and Schopf reacted strongly against it—thus signaling the tenor of the reaction it has engendered, though for shifting reasons, down to the present day."&lt;ref&gt;Eldredge, N. 1985.

==Theoretical mechanisms==
===Punctuational change===
When Eldredge and Gould published their 1972 paper, [[allopatric speciation]] was considered the "standard" model of speciation.&lt;ref name=pe1972 /&gt; This model was popularized by Ernst Mayr in his 1954 paper "Change of genetic environment and evolution,"&lt;ref name=Mayr1954 /&gt; and his classic volume ''Animal Species and Evolution'' (1963).&lt;ref name="Mayr1963"&gt;Mayr, Ernst (1963). ''Animal Species and Evolution''. Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Allopatric speciation suggests that species with large central populations are stabilized by their large volume and the process of [[gene flow]]. New and even [[Mutation#Beneficial mutations|beneficial mutations]] are diluted by the population's large size and are unable to reach fixation, due to such factors as constantly changing environments.&lt;ref name="Mayr1963" /&gt; If this is the case, then the transformation of whole lineages should be rare, as the fossil record indicates. Smaller populations on the other hand, which are isolated from the parental stock, are decoupled from the [[wikt:Homogeneous|homogenizing]] effects of gene flow. In addition, pressure from [[natural selection]] is especially intense, as peripheral isolated populations exist at the outer edges of ecological tolerance. If most evolution happens in these rare instances of allopatric speciation then evidence of gradual evolution in the fossil record should be rare. This [[hypothesis]] was alluded to by Mayr in the closing paragraph of his 1954 paper:

{{quote|Rapidly evolving peripherally isolated populations may be the place of origin of many evolutionary novelties. Their isolation and comparatively small size may explain phenomena of rapid evolution and lack of documentation in the fossil record, hitherto puzzling to the palaeontologist.&lt;ref name=Mayr1954 /&gt;}}

Although punctuated equilibrium generally applies to sexually reproducing organisms,&lt;ref&gt;Eldredge, Niles and S. J. Gould (1997). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/science_on-punctuated-equilibria.html "On punctuated equilibria (letter)."] ''Science'' 276 (5311): 337-341.&lt;/ref&gt; some biologists have applied the model to non-sexual species like [[virus]]es,&lt;ref&gt;Nichol, S.T, Joan Rowe, and Walter M. Fitch (1993). [http://www.pnas.org/content/90/22/10424.full.pdf "Punctuated equilibrium and positive Darwinian evolution in vesicular stomatitis virus."] ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' 90 (Nov.): 10424-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elena S.F., V.S.

As time went on biologists like Gould moved away from wedding punctuated equilibrium to allopatric speciation, particularly as evidence accumulated in support of other modes of speciation.&lt;ref name="GouldNewScientist"/&gt; Gould, for example, was particularly attracted to [[Douglas J. Futuyma|Douglas Futuyma's]] work on the importance of reproductive isolating mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Futuyma |first=Douglas |date=1987 |title=On the role of species in anagenesis |journal=[[The American Naturalist|American Naturalist]] |doi=10.1086/284724 |volume=130 |issue=3 |pages=465–473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stasis===
Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the [[wikt:putative|putative]] causes of stasis. Gould was initially attracted to [[I. Michael Lerner]]'s theories of developmental and genetic homeostasis. However this hypothesis was rejected over time,&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. 2002. ''[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]]''. Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nhIl7e61WOUC&amp;pg=PA39 39].&lt;/ref&gt; as evidence accumulated against it.&lt;ref name=Futuyma86&gt;Futuyma, Douglas (2005). ''Evolution''.

Biol.''  '''177''', 401-409]&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence for the existence of stasis has also been corroborated from the genetics of [[sibling species]], species which are morphologically indistinguishable, but whose proteins have diverged sufficiently to suggest they have been separated for millions of years.&lt;ref&gt;Maynard Smith, John (1989). ''Did Darwin Get it Right?'' New York: Chapman and Hall, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gould, "stasis may emerge as the theory's most important contribution to evolutionary science."&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. 2002. ''[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]]''. Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nhIl7e61WOUC&amp;pg=PA1155 872.]&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Kim Sterelny]] in clarifying the meaning of stasis adds, "In claiming that species typically undergo no further evolutionary change once speciation is complete, they are not claiming that there is no change at all between one generation and the next. Lineages do change. But the change between generations does not accumulate. Instead, over time, the species wobbles about its [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] mean. [[Jonathan Weiner]]'s ''[[The Beak of the Finch]]'' describes this very process."&lt;ref&gt;Sterelny, Kim (2007). ''[[Dawkins vs. Gould|Dawkins vs. Gould: Survival of the Fittest]]''. Cambridge, U.K.: Icon Books, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hierarchical evolution===
Punctuated equilibrium has also been cited as contributing to the hypothesis that species are [[Unit of selection|Darwinian individuals]], and not just [[class (biology)|classes]], thereby providing a stronger framework for a [[Unit of selection#Species selection and selection at higher taxonomic levels|hierarchical theory]] of evolution.&lt;ref name="CoordinatedStasis"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brett |first1=Carlton E. |last2=Ivany |first2=Linda C. |last3=Schopf |first3=Kenneth M. |date=1996 |title=Coordinated stasis: An overview |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |doi=10.1016/S0031-0182(96)00085-5 |volume=127 |issue=1–4 |pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common misconceptions==
Much confusion has arisen over what proponents of punctuated equilibrium actually argued, what mechanisms they advocated, how fast the punctuations were, what taxonomic scale their theory applied to, how revolutionary their claims were intended to be, and how punctuated equilibrium related to other ideas like [[Saltation (biology)|saltationism]], [[quantum evolution]], and [[mass extinction]].&lt;ref name="gould_pe-fact-theory"&gt;Gould, S. J. (1992) [http://systematicbiology.co.nf/Gould_1989_PunctuatedEquilibriumFactTheory.pdf "Punctuated equilibrium in fact and theory."] In Albert Somit and Steven Peterson ''The Dynamics of Evolution''. New York: Cornell University Press. pp.&amp;nbsp;54–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saltationism===
[[File:Punctuated Equilibrium.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Alternative explanations for the punctuated pattern of evolution observed in the fossil record. Both [[macromutation]] and relatively rapid episodes of gradual evolution could give the appearance of instantaneous change, since 10,000 years seldom registers in the geological record.]]

The punctuational nature of punctuated equilibrium has engendered perhaps the most confusion over Eldredge and Gould's theory. Gould's sympathetic treatment of [[Richard Goldschmidt]],&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1976). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_hopeful-monsters.html "The Return of Hopeful Monsters,"] ''Natural History'' 86 (June/July): 22-30.&lt;/ref&gt; the controversial [[genetics|geneticist]] who advocated the idea of "[[hopeful monster]]s," led some biologists to conclude that Gould's punctuations were occurring in single-generation jumps.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst (1982). ''Growth of Biological Thought''. Harvard University Press, [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/mayr_macroevolutionary-diversity.pdf p. 617]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maynard Smith, J.

''The Face That Demonstrates the Farce of Evolution''. Nashville, TN: Word Publishing, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ta-qOuhtGkAC&amp;pg=PA40 pp. 40-45.]&lt;/ref&gt; In an often quoted remark, Gould stated, "Since we proposed punctuated equilibria to explain trends, it is infuriating to be quoted again and again by creationists—whether through design or stupidity, I do not know—as admitting that the fossil record includes no [[Transitional fossil|transitional forms]]. Transitional forms are generally lacking at the species level, but they are [[List of transitional fossils|abundant between larger groups]]."&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1981). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html "Evolution as Fact and Theory,"] ''Discover'' 2 (May): 34-37.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there exist some debate over how long the punctuations last, supporters of punctuated equilibrium generally place the figure between 50,000 and 100,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ayala |first1=F. |date=2005 |title=The Structure of Evolutionary Theory |url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/reviews/ayala_structure.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Theology and Science |doi=10.1080/14746700500039800 |volume=3 |issue=1 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantum evolution===
[[Quantum evolution]] was a controversial hypothesis advanced by [[Columbia University]] paleontologist [[George Gaylord Simpson]], who was regarded by Gould as "the greatest and most biologically astute paleontologist of the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (2007) ''Punctuated equilibrium''. Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson's conjecture was that according to the geological record, on very rare occasions evolution would proceed very rapidly to form entirely new [[Family (biology)|families]], [[Order (biology)|orders]], and [[Class (biology)|classes]] of organisms.&lt;ref name=Simpson1944&gt;Simpson, G. G. (1944). ''[[Tempo and Mode in Evolution]]''. New York: Columbia Univ. Press, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fitch, W. J. and F. J. Ayala (1995) [https://download.nap.edu/cart/download.cgi?record_id=4910 ''Tempo and mode in evolution: genetics and paleontology 50 years after Simpson''.] Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis differs from punctuated equilibrium in several respects. First, punctuated equilibrium was more modest in scope, in that it was addressing evolution specifically at the [[species]] level.&lt;ref name=Gould&amp;Eldredge1977 /&gt; Simpson's idea was principally concerned with evolution at higher taxonomic groups.&lt;ref name=Simpson1944 /&gt; Second, Eldredge and Gould relied upon a different mechanism. Where Simpson relied upon a [[Synergy|synergistic]] interaction between [[genetic drift]] and a shift in the [[fitness landscape|adaptive fitness landscape]],&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, G. G. (1953). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/simpson_evolutionary-rates.html ''The Major Features of Evolution'']. New York: Columbia Univ. Press, p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; Eldredge and Gould relied upon ordinary speciation, particularly Ernst Mayr's concept of allopatric speciation. Lastly, and perhaps most significantly, quantum evolution took no position on the issue of stasis. Although Simpson acknowledged the existence of stasis in what he called the bradytelic mode, he considered it (along with rapid evolution) to be unimportant in the larger scope of evolution.&lt;ref name="Simpson1944p206"&gt;Simpson, G. G. (1944). ''[[Tempo and Mode in Evolution]]''. New York: Columbia Univ. Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=f5qucNebo-kC&amp;pg=PA205 pp. 205-206.]&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Major Features of Evolution'' Simpson stated, "Evolutionary change is so nearly the universal rule that a state of motion is, figuratively, normal in evolving populations. The state of rest, as in bradytely, is the exception and it seems that some restraint or force must be required to maintain it." Despite such differences between the two models, earlier critiques—from such eminent commentators as [[Sewall Wright]] as well as Simpson himself—have argued that punctuated equilibrium is little more than quantum evolution relabeled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wright |first=Sewall |date=1982 |title=Character change, speciation, and the higher taxa |journal=Evolution |doi=10.2307/2408092 |volume=56 |issue=3 |page=427 |url=http://stewardshipofcreationenabler.giving.officelive.com/Documents/21_Wright1982.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828022050/http://stewardshipofcreationenabler.giving.officelive.com/Documents/21_Wright1982.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, G. G. (1984) ''Tempo and Mode in Evolution''. Reprint. Columbia University Press, p. xxv.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple meanings of gradualism===
Punctuated equilibrium is often portrayed to oppose the concept of [[Gradualism#Geology and biology|gradualism]], when it is actually a form of gradualism.&lt;ref name="Dawkins, Richard 1996 p. 224-252"&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., Chapter 9. (p. 224-252)&lt;/ref&gt; This is because even though evolutionary change appears instantaneous between geological sedimentary layers, change is still occurring incrementally, with no great change from one generation to the next. To this end, Gould later commented that "Most of our [[paleontology|paleontological colleagues]] missed this insight because they had not studied evolutionary theory and either did not know about [[allopatric speciation]] or had not considered its translation to geological time. Our [[Population genetics|evolutionary colleagues]] also failed to grasp the implication(s), primarily because they did not think at geological scales".&lt;ref name=Opus200/&gt;

[[Richard Dawkins]] dedicated a chapter in ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' to correcting, in his view, the wide confusion regarding ''rates of change''. His first point is to argue that [[phyletic gradualism]] — understood in the sense that evolution proceeds at a single uniform rate of speed, called "constant speedism" by Dawkins — is a "caricature of Darwinism"&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; and "does not really exist".&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). The Blind Watchmaker, p. 228. Dawkins' exception to this rule is the non-adaptive evolution observed in molecular evolution.&lt;/ref&gt; His second argument, which follows from the first, is that once the caricature of "constant speedism" is dismissed, we are left with one logical alternative, which Dawkins terms "variable speedism". Variable speedism may also be distinguished one of two ways: "''discrete variable'' speedism" and "''continuously variable'' speedism". Eldredge and Gould, proposing that evolution jumps between stability and relative rapidity, are described as "discrete variable speedists", and "in this respect they are genuinely radical."&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; They assert that evolution generally proceeds in bursts, or not at all. "Continuously variable speedists", on the other hand, advance that "evolutionary rates fluctuate continuously from very fast to very slow and stop, with all intermediates. They see no particular reason to emphasize certain speeds more than others. In particular, stasis, to them, is just an extreme case of ultra-slow evolution. To a punctuationist, there is something very special about stasis."&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). The Blind Watchmaker, p. 245-246.&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins therefore commits himself here to an empirical claim about the geological record,{{original research inline|date=May 2016}} in contrast to his earlier claim that "The paleontological evidence can be argued about, and I am not qualified to judge it."&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, R (1982) ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]''. London: Oxford University Press, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; It is this particular commitment that Eldredge and Gould have aimed to overturn.

==Criticism==
[[Richard Dawkins]] regards the apparent gaps represented in the fossil record to document migratory events rather than evolutionary events. According to Dawkins, evolution certainly occurred but  "probably gradually" elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the punctuational equilibrium model may still be inferred from both the observation of stasis and examples of rapid and episodic speciation events documented in the fossil record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cheetham |first1=Alan |authorlink1=Alan Cheetham |last2=Jackson |first2=Jeremy |last3=Hayek |first3=Lee-Ann |author3-link= Lee-Ann C. Hayek |date=1994 |title=Quantitative genetics of bryozoan phenotypic evolution |journal=Evolution |doi=10.2307/2410098 |volume=48 |pages=360–375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins also emphasizes that punctuated equilibrium has been "oversold by some journalists",&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', p. 250-251.&lt;/ref&gt; but partly due to Eldredge and Gould's "later writings".&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins contends that the hypothesis "does not deserve a particularly large measure of publicity".&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a "minor gloss," an "interesting but minor wrinkle on the surface of neo-Darwinian theory," and "lies firmly within the neo-Darwinian synthesis".&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] is especially critical of Gould's presentation of punctuated equilibrium. Dennett argues that Gould alternated between revolutionary and conservative claims, and that each time Gould made a revolutionary statement—or appeared to do so—he was criticized, and thus retreated to a traditional neo-Darwinian position.&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, Daniel (1995). ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, pp. 282-299.&lt;/ref&gt; Gould responded to Dennett's claims in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1997). [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1151 "Darwinian Fundamentalism"] ''The New York Review of Books'', June 12, pp. 34-37; and [https://web.archive.org/web/20161110121332/http://www.stephenjaygould.org/reviews/gould_pluralism.html "Evolution: The Pleasures of Pluralism"] ''The New York Review of Books'', June 26, pp. 47-52.&lt;/ref&gt; and in his technical volume ''[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S.

English professor Heidi Scott argues that Gould's talent for writing vivid prose, his use of metaphor, and his success in building a popular audience of nonspecialist readers altered the "climate of specialized scientific discourse" favorably in his promotion of punctuated equilibrium.&lt;ref name=scott&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=Heidi |date=2007 |title=Stephen Jay Gould and the Rhetoric of Evolutionary Theory |journal=Rhetoric Review |doi=10.1080/07350190709336705 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=120–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Gould is celebrated for the color and energy of his prose, as well as his interdisciplinary knowledge, critics such as Scott, Richard Dawkins, and Daniel Dennett have concerns that the theory has gained undeserved credence among non-scientists because of Gould's rhetorical skills.&lt;ref name=scott /&gt; Philosopher John Lyne and biologist Henry Howe believed punctuated equilibrium's success has much more to do with the nature of the geological record than the nature of Gould's rhetoric. They state, a "re-analysis of existing fossil data has shown, to the increasing satisfaction of the paleontological community, that Eldredge and Gould were correct in identifying periods of evolutionary stasis which are interrupted by much shorter periods of evolutionary change."&lt;ref&gt;Lyne, John and Henry Howe "'Punctuated Equilibria': Rhetorical Dynamics of a Scientific Controversy". in Harris, R. A. ed. (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=CGvK8pBsiSAC&amp;pg=PA69 ''Landmark Essays on Rhetoric of Science''.] Mahwah NJ: Hermagoras Press, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics jokingly referred to the theory of punctuated equilibrium as "evolution by jerks",&lt;ref&gt;Turner, John (1984). [https://books.google.com/books?id=6idhDboGmZoC&amp;pg=PA34 "Why we need evolution by jerks."] ''New Scientist'' 101 (Feb. 9): 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;
which reportedly prompted punctuationists to describe [[phyletic gradualism]] as "evolution by creeps."&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. and Steven Rose, ed. (2007). ''The Richness of Life: The Essential Stephen Jay Gould''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., [https://books.google.com/books?id=yfXJhKmp1wUC&amp;pg=PA6 p. 6.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Darwin's theory==
The sudden appearance of most species in the geologic record and the lack of evidence of substantial gradual change in most [[species]]—from their initial appearance until their extinction—has [[Speciation#Darwin's dilemma: Why do species exist?|long been noted]], including by [[Charles Darwin]] who appealed to the imperfection of the record as the favored explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1859). ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. London: John Murray, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1871). ''[[The Origin of Species]]''. London: John Murray, p. 119-120.&lt;/ref&gt; When presenting his ideas against the prevailing influences of [[catastrophism]] and [[progressive creationism]], which envisaged species being supernaturally created at intervals, Darwin needed to forcefully stress the gradual nature of [[evolution]] in accordance with the [[gradualism]] promoted by his friend [[Charles Lyell]]. He privately expressed concern, noting in the margin of his 1844 ''Essay'', "Better begin with this: If species really, after catastrophes, created in showers world over, my theory false."&lt;ref name=VQR&gt;Eldredge, Niles (2006) [http://www.vqronline.org/articles/2006/spring/eldredge-confessions-darwinist/ "Confessions of a Darwinist."] ''[[The Virginia Quarterly Review]]'' 82 (Spring): 32-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often incorrectly assumed that he insisted that the rate of change must be constant, or nearly so, but even the first edition of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' states that "Species of different genera and classes have not changed at the same rate, or in the same degree. In the oldest tertiary beds a few living shells may still be found in the midst of a multitude of extinct forms... The Silurian ''Lingula'' differs but little from the living species of this genus". ''[[Lingula (genus)|Lingula]]'' is among the few brachiopods surviving today but also known from fossils over 500 million years old.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1859). ''On the Origin of Species''. London: John Murray. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=331 p. 313].&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourth edition (1866) of ''On the Origin of Species'' Darwin wrote that "the periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured in years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which they retain the same form."&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1869). ''The Origin of Species''. London: John Murray. 5th edition, [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F387&amp;pageseq=583 p. 551].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus punctuationism in general is consistent with Darwin's conception of evolution.&lt;ref name=VQR/&gt;

According to early versions of punctuated equilibrium, "peripheral isolates" are considered to be of critical importance for speciation. However, Darwin wrote, "''I can by no means agree'' ... that immigration and isolation are necessary elements....  Although isolation is of great importance in the production of new species, on the whole I am inclined to believe that largeness of area is still more important, especially for the production of species which shall prove capable of enduring for a long period, and of spreading widely."&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1869). ''The Origin of Species''. London: John Murray. 5th edition, [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F387&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 pp. 120-121.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of isolation in forming species had played a significant part in Darwin's early thinking, as shown in his ''Essay'' of 1844. But by the time he wrote the ''Origin'' he had downplayed its importance.&lt;ref name=VQR/&gt; He explained the reasons for his revised view as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Throughout a great and open area, not only will there be a greater chance of favourable variations, arising from the large number of individuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions of life are much more complex from the large number of already existing species; and if some of these species become modified and improved, others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree, or they will be exterminated. Each new form, also, as soon as it has been improved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many other forms&amp;nbsp;... the new forms produced on large areas, which have already been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will spread most widely, and will give rise to the greatest number of new varieties and species. They will thus play a more important role in the changing history of the organic world.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1869). ''The Origin of Species''. London: John Murray. 5th edition, [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F387&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 pp. 121-122.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus punctuated equilibrium is incongruous with some of Darwin's ideas regarding the specific mechanisms of evolution, but generally accords with Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.&lt;ref name=VQR/&gt;&lt;ref name="ComesOfAge"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |authorlink1=Stephen Jay Gould |last2=Eldredge |first2=Niles |authorlink2=Niles Eldredge |date=1993 |title=Punctuated equilibrium comes of age |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/366223a0 |pmid=8232582|volume=366 |issue=6452 |pages=223–227 |url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_comes-of-age.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supplemental modes of rapid evolution==
{{See also|Rapid modes of evolution}}
Recent work in [[developmental biology]] has identified dynamical and physical mechanisms of [[morphogenesis|tissue morphogenesis]] that may underlie abrupt morphological transitions during evolution. Consequently, consideration of mechanisms of phylogenetic change that have been found in reality to be non-gradual is increasingly common in the field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]], particularly in studies of the origin of morphological novelty. A description of such mechanisms can be found in the multi-authored volume ''[[Origination of Organismal Form]]'' (MIT Press; 2003).

==Language change==
{{See also|Language change}}
In linguistics, [[R. M. W. Dixon]] has proposed a punctuated equilibrium model for language histories,&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, R.M.W. (1997). ''The rise and fall of languages'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; with reference particularly to the prehistory of the [[indigenous languages of Australia]] and his objections to the proposed [[Pama–Nyungan languages|Pama–Nyungan]] language family there. Although his model has raised considerable interest, it does not command majority support within linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/books/9789027295118|title=Australian Languages|last=|first=|date=2004-03-18|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=9789027295118|editor-last=Bowern|editor-first=Claire|location=|pages=|language=en|doi=10.1075/cilt.249|editor-last2=Koch|editor-first2=Harold}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separately, recent work using [[computational phylogenetics|computational phylogenetic]] methods claims to show that punctuational bursts play an important factor when [[language change|languages split from one another]], accounting for anywhere from 10 to 33% of the total divergence in vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Atkinson |first1=Quentin D. |last2=Meade |first2=Andrew |last3=Venditti |first3=Chris |last4=Greenhill |first4=Simon J. |last5=Pagel |first5=Mark |date=2008 |title=Languages Evolve in Punctuational Bursts |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |doi=10.1126/science.1149683 |pmid=18239118 |volume=319 |issue=5863 |page=588}}; Dan Dediu mail, Stephen C.

==Rationale==

There is a need for a [[computer program]] that is easier to operate and that requires a simpler [[data structure]] then most currently available models. Therefore, the SahysMod program was designed keeping in mind a relative simplicity of operation to facilitate the use by field technicians, engineers and project planners instead of specialized [[geohydrology|geo-hydrologists]].&lt;br&gt;
It aims at using input data that are generally available, or that can be estimated with reasonable accuracy, or that can be measured with relative ease. Although the calculations are done numerically and have to be repeated many times, the final results can be ''checked by hand'' using the formulas in this manual.

SahysMod's [[goal|objective]] is to predict the [[long-term]] hydro-[[salinity]] in terms of general [[Trend estimation|trend]]s, not to arrive at exact predictions of how, for example, the situation would be on the first of April in ten years from now.&lt;br&gt;
Further, SahysMod gives the option of the re-use of drainage and [[Water well|well]] water (e.g. for [[irrigation]]) and it can account for [[farmer]]s' responses to [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]], [[soil salinity]], water scarcity and over-pumping from the [[aquifer]]. Also it offers the possibility to introduce [[subsurface drainage]] systems at varying depths and with varying capacities so that they can be [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimized]].
Other features of SahysMod are found in the next section.

== Methods ==

=== Calculation of aquifer conditions in polygons ===
[[File:Aquifer en.svg|thumb|250px|Example of an aquifer]]

The model calculates the ground water levels and the incoming and outgoing ground water flows between the [[polygon]]s by a numerical solution of the well-known [[Boussinesq approximation (water waves)|Boussinesq equation]]. The levels and flows influence each other mutually.
The ground water situation is further determined by the vertical [[groundwater recharge]] that is calculated from the agronomic [[Hydrology (agriculture)|water balance]]. These depend again on the levels of the [[ground water]].

When semi-confined [[aquifer]]s are present, the resistance to vertical flow in the slowly permeable top-layer and the overpressure in the aquifer, if any, are taken into account.

Hydraulic [[boundary conditions]] are given as [[hydraulic head]]s in the external nodes in combination with the [[hydraulic conductivity]] between internal and external nodes. If one wishes to impose a zero [[flow conditioning|flow condition]] at the external nodes, the conductivity can be set at zero.

Further, [[aquifer]] flow conditions can be given for the internal nodes. These are required when a [[Fault (geology)|geological fault]] is present at the bottom of the aquifer or when flow occurs between the main aquifer and a deeper aquifer separated by a semi-confining layer.

The depth of the [[water table]], the [[rainfall]] and salt concentrations of the deeper layers are assumed to be the same over the whole polygon. Other parameters can very within the polygons according to type of crops and cropping rotation schedule.

=== Seasonal approach ===

The model is based on seasonal input data and returns seasonal outputs. The number of seasons per year can be chosen between a minimum of one and a maximum of four. One can distinguish for example dry, wet, cold, hot, irrigation or [[fallow]] seasons. Reasons of not using smaller input/output periods are:
#short-term (e.g., daily) inputs would require much information, which, in large areas, may not be readily available;
#short-term outputs would lead to immense output files, which would be difficult to manage and interpret;
#this model is especially developed to predict long-term trends, and predictions for the future are more reliably made on a seasonal (long-term) than on a daily (short-term) basis, due to the high variability of short-term data;
#though the precision of the predictions for the future may be limited, a lot is gained when the trend is sufficiently clear. For example, it need not be a major constraint to the design of appropriate [[soil salinity control]] measures when a certain salinity level, predicted by SahysMod to occur after 20 years, will in reality occur after 15 or 25 years.

=== Computational time steps ===

Many [[water balance]] factors depend on the level of the [[water table]], which again depends on some of the water-balance factors. Due to these mutual influences there can be non-linear changes throughout the season. Therefore, the [[computer program]] performs daily calculations. For this purpose, the seasonal water-balance factors given with the inpu] are reduced automatically to daily values. The calculated seasonal water-balance factors, as given in the output, are obtained by summations of the daily calculated values. [[Groundwater]] levels and [[soil salinity]] (the [[state variable]]s) at the end of the season are found by accumulating the daily changes of water and salt storage.

In some cases the program may detect that the time step must be taken less than 1 day for better accuracy. The necessary adjustments are made automatically.

==Data requirements==

=== Polygonal network ===
[[Image:Garmsar.gif|thumb|250px|A polygonal network]]
The model permits a maximum of 240 internal and 120 external [[polygon]]s with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 6 sides each. The subdivision of the area into polygons, based on nodal points with known [[coordinates]], should be governed by the characteristics of the distribution of the [[crop]]ping, [[irrigation]], [[drainage]] and [[groundwater]] characteristics over the study area.

The nodes must be numbered, which can be done at will. With an index one indicates whether the node is internal or external. Nodes can be added and removed at will or changed from internal to external or vice versa. Through another index one indicates whether the internal nodes have an unconfined or semi-confined aquifer. This can also be changed at will.

Nodal network relations are to be given indicating the neighboring polygon numbers of each node. The program then calculates the surface area of each polygon, the distance between the nodes and the length of the sides between them using the Thiessen principle.

The [[hydraulic conductivity]] can vary for each side of the polygons.

The depth of the [[water table]], the [[rainfall]] and [[salt]] concentrations of the deeper layers are assumed to be the same over the whole polygon. Other [[parameters]] can very within the polygons according to type of crops and cropping rotation schedule.

=== Hydrological data ===
[[Image:File-Saltmod8 (2).JPG|thumb|SahysMod components]]
The method uses seasonal water balance components as input data. These are related to the surface [[hydrology]] (like rainfall, [[potential evaporation]], [[irrigation]], use of drain and well water for irrigation, [[Surface runoff|runoff]]), and the aquifer hydrology (e.g., pumping from [[Water well|wells]]). The other [[water balance]] components (like actual evaporation, downward [[percolation]], upward [[capillary rise]], [[subsurface drainage]], [[groundwater flow]]) are given as output.

The quantity of drainage water, as output, is determined by two drainage intensity factors for drainage above and below drain level respectively (to be given with the input data) and the height of the water table above the given drain level. This height results from the computed water balance Further, a drainage reduction factor can be applied to simulate a limited operation of the drainage system. Variation of the drainage intensity factors and the drainage reduction factor gives the opportunity to simulate the effect of different drainage options.

To obtain accuracy in the computations of the ground water flow (sect. 2.8), the actual evaporation and the capillary rise, the computer calculations are done on a daily basis. For this purpose, the seasonal hydrological data are divided by the number of days per season to obtain daily values. The daily values are added to yield seasonal values.

=== Cropping patterns/rotations ===

The input data on irrigation, evaporation, and surface runoff are to be specified per season for three kinds of agricultural practices, which can be chosen at the discretion of the user:

:A: irrigated land with crops of group A
:B: irrigated land with crops of group B
:U: non-irrigated land with rain-fed crops or fallow land
[[File:Plain of punjab.jpg|thumb|250px|Irrigated land]]

The groups, expressed in fractions of the total area, may consist of combinations of [[crop]]s or just of a single kind of crop. For example, as the A-type crops one may specify the lightly irrigated cultures, and as the B type the more heavily irrigated ones, such as [[sugarcane]] and [[rice]]. But one can also take A as rice and B as sugar cane, or perhaps [[tree]]s and [[orchard]]s. A, B and/or U crops can be taken differently in different seasons, e.g. A=[[wheat]] plus [[barley]] in winter and A=[[maize]] in summer while B=[[vegetable]]s in winter and B=[[cotton]] in summer. Non-irrigated land can be specified in two ways: (1) as U = 1&amp;minus;A&amp;minus;B and (2) as A and/or B with zero irrigation. A combination can also be made.

Further, a specification must be given of the seasonal [[crop rotation|rotation]] of the different [[land use]]s over the total area, e.g. full rotation, no rotation at all, or incomplete rotation.  This occurs with a rotation index. The rotations are taken over the seasons within the year. To obtain rotations over the years it is advisable to introduce annual input changes as explained

When a fraction A1, B1 and/or U1 differs from the fraction A2, B2 and/or U2 in another season, because the irrigation regime changes in the different seasons, the program will detect that a certain rotation occurs. If one wishes to avoid this, one may specify the same fractions in all seasons (A2=A1, B2=B1, U2=U1) but the crops and irrigation quantities may be different and may need to be proportionally adjusted. One may even specify irrigated land (A or B) with zero irrigation, which is the same as un-irrigated land (U).

[[crop rotation|Cropping rotation]] schedules vary widely in different parts of the world. Creative combinations of area fractions, rotation indexes, irrigation quantities and annual input changes can accommodate many types of agricultural practices.

Variation of the area fractions and/or the rotational schedule gives the opportunity to [[simulate]] the effect of different agricultural practices on the water and salt balance.

=== Soil strata, type of aquifer ===

SahysMod accepts four different reservoirs of which three are in the soil profile:

:s: a surface reservoir,
:r: an upper (shallow) soil reservoir or root zone,
:x: an intermediate soil reservoir or transition zone,
:q: a deep reservoir or main [[aquifer]].

The upper soil reservoir is defined by the soil depth, from which water can evaporate or be taken up by plant roots. It can be taken equal to the root zone. It can be saturated, unsaturated, or partly saturated, depending on the water balance. All water movements in this zone are vertical, either upward or downward, depending on the water balance. (In a future version of Sahysmod, the upper soil reservoir may be divided into two equal parts to detect the trend in the vertical salinity distribution.)

The transition zone can also be saturated, unsaturated or partly saturated. All flows in this zone are horizontal, except the flow to subsurface drains, which is radial.
If a horizontal subsurface drainage system is present, this must be placed in the transition zone, which is then divided into two parts: an upper transition zone (above drain level) and a lower transition zone (below drain level).

If one wishes to distinguish an upper and lower part of the transition zone in the absence of a subsurface drainage system, one may specify in the input data a drainage system with zero intensity.

The aquifer has mainly horizontal flow. Pumped [[Water well|wells]], if present, receive their water from the aquifer only. The flow in the aquifer is determined in dependence of spatially varying depths of the aquifer, levels of the water table, and [[hydraulic conductivity]].

SahysMod permits the introduction of ''phreatic'' ([[unconfined aquifer|unconfined]]) and ''semi-confined'' aquifers. The latter may develop a hydraulic over or under pressure below the slowly permeable top-layer ([[aquitard]]).

=== Agricultural water balances ===
[[File:WatBalan.JPG|thumb|250px|Inflow and outflow factors of water into and out from the soil reservoirs needed to find the waterbalances]]
The agricultural [[water balance]]s are calculated for each soil reservoir separately as shown in the article [[Hydrology (agriculture)]]. The excess water leaving one reservoir is converted into incoming water for the next reservoir. The three soil reservoirs can be assigned different thickness and storage coefficients, to be given as input data. When, in a particular situation the transition zone or the aquifer is not present, they must be given a minimum thickness of 0.1 m.

The depth of the [[water table]] at the end of the previous time step, calculated from the [[water balance]]s, is assumed to be the same within each [[polygon]]. If this assumption is not acceptable, the area must be divided into a larger number of polygons.

Under certain conditions, the height of the water table influences the water-balance components. For example, a rise of the water table towards the soil surface may lead to an increase of capillary rise, actual evaporation, and subsurface drainage, or a decrease of percolation losses. This, in turn, leads to a change of the water-balance, which again influences the height of the water table, etc. This chain of reactions is one of the reasons why Sahysmod has been developed into a [[computer program]], in which the computations are made day by day to account for the chain of reactions with a sufficient degree of [[accuracy]].

=== Drains, wells, and re-use ===
[[File:DrainSection2.png|thumb|250px|Parameters of a horizontal subsurfce drainage system]]
The sub-surface [[Drainage system (agriculture)|drainage]] can be accomplished through drains or pumped wells.

The subsurface drains, if any, are characterized by drain depth and ''drainage capacity''. The drains are located in the transition zone. The subsurface drainage facility can be applied to natural or artificial drainage systems. The functioning of an artificial drainage system can be regulated through a drainage control factor.

By installing a drainage system with zero capacity one obtains the opportunity to have separate water and salt balances in the transition above and below drain level.

The pumped [[Water well|wells]], if any, are located in the aquifer. Their functioning is characterized by the well [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]].

The drain and well water can be used for [[irrigation]] through a ''(re)use factor''. This may affect the water and salt balance and on the irrigation efficiency or sufficiency.

=== Salt balances ===
[[File:Mpbas.gif|thumb|250px|Graphic example of soil salinity trends in the transition zone]]

The [[Soil salinity control|salt balances]] are calculated for each soil reservoir separately. They are based on their [[Hydrology (agriculture)|water balances]], using the salt concentrations of the incoming and outgoing water. Some concentrations must be given as input data, like the initial salt concentrations of the water in the different soil reservoirs, of the irrigation water and of the incoming groundwater in the aquifer. The concentrations are expressed in terms of [[electric conductivity]] (EC in dS/m). When the concentrations are known in terms of g salt/l water, the rule of thumb: 1 g/l -&gt; 1.7 dS/m can be used. Usually, salt concentrations of the soil are expressed in ECe, the electric conductivity of an extract of a saturated soil paste. In Sahysmod, the salt concentration is expressed as the EC of the soil moisture when saturated under field conditions. As a rule, one can use the conversion rate EC : ECe = 2 : 1. The principles used are correspond to those described in the article [[soil salinity control]].

Salt concentrations of outgoing water (either from one reservoir into the other or by subsurface drainage) are computed on the basis of salt balances, using different leaching or salt mixing efficiencies to be given with the input data. The effects of different [[Leaching model (soil)#Leaching efficiency|leaching efficiencies]] can be simulated varying their input value.

If drain or well water is used for irrigation, the method computes the salt concentration of the mixed irrigation water in the course of the time and the subsequent effect on the soil and ground water salinity, which again influences the salt concentration of the drain and well water. By varying the fraction of used drain or well water (through the input), the long-term effect of different fractions can be simulated.

The [[solvation|dissolution]] of solid soil minerals or the [[precipitation (chemistry)|chemical precipitation]] of poorly soluble salts is not included in the computation method. However, but to some extent, it can be accounted for through the input data, e.g. increasing or decreasing the salt concentration of the irrigation water or of the incoming water in the [[aquifer]]. In a future version, the precipitation of gypsum may be introduced.

=== Farmers' responses ===

If required, farmers' responses to [[waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]] and [[soil salinity]] can be automatically accounted for. The method can gradually decrease:

# The amount of [[irrigation]] water applied when the water table becomes shallower depending on the kind of crop (paddy rice and non-rice)
# The fraction of irrigated land when the available [[irrigation]] water is scarce;
# The fraction of irrigated land when the [[soil salinity]] increases; for this purpose, the salinity is given a [[stochastic]] interpretation;
# The [[groundwater]] abstraction by pumping from [[Water well|wells]] when the water table drops.

The farmers' responses influence the water and salt balances, which, in turn, slows down the process of water logging and salinization. Ultimately a new equilibrium situation will arise.

The user can also introduce farmers' responses by manually changing the relevant input data. Perhaps it will be useful first to study the automatic farmers' responses and their effect first and thereafter decide what the farmers' responses will be in the view of the user.

=== Annual input changes ===

The program runs either with fixed input data for the number of years determined by the user. This option can be used to predict future developments based on long-term average input values, e.g. rainfall, as it will be difficult to assess the future values of the input data year by year.

The program also offers the possibility to follow historic records with annually changing input values (e.g. rainfall, irrigation, cropping rotations), the calculations must be made year by year. If this possibility is chosen, the program creates a transfer file by which the final conditions of the previous year (e.g. water table and salinity) are automatically used as the initial conditions for the subsequent period. This facility makes it also possible to use various generated rainfall sequences drawn randomly from a known rainfall probability distribution and to obtain a stochastic prediction of the resulting output parameters.

Some input parameters should not be changed, like the nodal network relations, the system [[geometry]], the thickness of the soil layers, and the total [[porosity]], otherwise illogical jumps occur in the water and salt balances. These parameters are also stored in the transfer file, so that any impermissible change is overruled by the transfer data. In some cases of incorrect changes, the program will stop and request the user to adjust the input.

==Output data==
[[Image:GOHANAFREQ.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Cumulative frequency distribution of soil salinity]]
[[Image:GarmsarDWT.png|thumb|right|250px|Example of the polygonal mapping facilities using the depth of the watertable]]
The output is given for each season of any year during any number of years, as specified with the input data. The output data comprise hydrological and salinity aspects.&lt;br&gt;
As the soil salinity is very variable from place to place (figure left) SahysMod includes [[Cumulative frequency analysis|frequency distributions]] in the output. The figure was made with the CumFreq program [http://www.waterlog.info/cumfreq.htm] .&lt;br&gt; 
The output data are filed in the form of tables that can be inspected directly, through the user menu, that calls selected groups of data either for a certain [[polygon]] over time, or for a certain season over the polygons. &lt;br /&gt;
The model includes mapping facilties of output data. Also, the program has the facility to store the selected data in a [[spreadsheet]] format for further analysis and for import into a [[GIS]] program. &lt;br /&gt;
Different users may wish to establish different cause-effect relationships. The program offers only a limited number of standard [[graphics]], as it is not possible to foresee all different uses that may be made. This is the reason why the possibility for further analysis through spreadsheet programs was created.&lt;br&gt;
Although the [[computations]] need many [[iterations]], all the end results can be ''checked by hand'' using the equations presented in the manual.

'''''Salmonella enterica'' subsp. ''enterica''''' is a subspecies of ''[[Salmonella enterica]]'', the rod-shaped, [[flagella]]ted, aerobic, [[Gram-negative]] [[bacterium]]. Many of the pathogenic [[serovar]]s of the ''S. enterica'' species are in this [[subspecies]], including that responsible for [[typhoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Medical Microbiology |edition=6th |page=307 |vauthors=Murray PR, Rosenthal KS, Pfaller MA |year=2009 |location=Philadelphia, PA |publisher=Mosby Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serovars==
''S. enterica'' subsp. ''enterica'' contains a large number of serovars which can infect a broad range of [[vertebrate]] hosts. The individual members range from being highly host-adapted (only able to infect a narrow range of species) to displaying a broad host range. A number of techniques are currently used to differentiate between [[serotype]]s. These include looking for the presence or absence of [[antigen]]s, [[phage typing]], molecular fingerprinting and biotyping, where serovars are differentiated by which nutrients they are able to ferment. A possible factor in determining the host range of particular serovars is phage-mediated acquisition of a small number of genetic elements that enable infection of a particular host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sternlicht M, Staaby J, Sullivan I | title = Birth order, maternal age, and mental retardation | journal = Mental Retardation | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 3–6 | date = December 1975 | pmc = 127920 | doi = 10.1128/IAI.70.5.2249-2255.2002 | pmid = 11953356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is further postulated that serovars which infect a narrow range of species have diverged from ancestors with a broad host range, and have since specialised and lost the ability to infect some hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Langridge GC, Fookes M, Connor TR, Feltwell T, Feasey N, Parsons BN, Seth-Smith HM, Barquist L, Stedman A, Humphrey T, Wigley P, Peters SE, Maskell DJ, Corander J, Chabalgoity JA, Barrow P, Parkhill J, Dougan G, Thomson NR | title = Patterns of genome evolution that have accompanied host adaptation in Salmonella | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 112 | issue = 3 | pages = 863–8 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25535353 | pmc = 4311825 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1416707112 | author13-link = Duncan Maskell }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of data from 37 countries collected between 2001 and 2007 found that the most common serovar of ''Salmonella'' isolated from human cases was Enteritidis, found in an average of 43.5% of cases, followed by Typhimurium (17.1% of cases), Newport (3.5%), Infantis (1.8%), Virchow (1.5%), Hadar (1.5%), and Agona (0.8%).&lt;ref name="Global monitoring"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hendriksen RS, Vieira AR, Karlsmose S, Lo Fo Wong DM, Jensen AB, Wegener HC, Aarestrup FM | title = Global monitoring of Salmonella serovar distribution from the World Health Organization Global Foodborne Infections Network Country Data Bank: results of quality assured laboratories from 2001 to 2007 | journal = Foodborne Pathogens and Disease | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = 887–900 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21492021 | doi = 10.1089/fpd.2010.0787 | url = http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/global-monitoring-of-salmonella-serovar-distribution-from-the-world-health-organization-global-foodborne-infections-network-country-data-bank-results-of-quality-assured-laboratories-from-2001-to-2007(3360b495-8158-401c-bf87-ada8a4a6b0ee).html | format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One strain of ''Salmonella'' that has recently been emerging in the United States is ''Salmonella javiana''. "An outbreak occurred in 2002, there were 141 cases that occurred among the participants of the U.S. Transplant Games. Out of the 141 cases, most of the cases were either transplant recipients (34%) or people receiving immunosuppressive therapy (32%)". There is an increasing number of ''Salmonella'' serotypes that are multidrug resistant (MDR), which was identified by the CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Goldrick|first1 = Barbara|title = Emerging Infections: Foodborne Diseases|journal = The American Journal of Nursing|date = March 2003|volume = 103|issue = 3|pages = 105–106|jstor=29745004|doi = 10.1097/00000446-200303000-00043}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''Salmonella javiana'' causes 4% of nontyphodial ''Salmonella'' infections in the United States each year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elward A, Grim A, Schroeder P, Kieffer P, Sellenriek P, Ferrett R, Adams HC, Phillips V, Bartow R, Mays D, Lawrence S, Seed P, Holzmann-Pazgal G, Polish L, Leet T, Fraser V | title = Outbreak of Salmonella javiana infection at a children's hospital | journal = Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 586–92 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16755478 | doi = 10.1086/506483 | jstor = 10.1086/506483 | url = https://digitalcommons.wustl.edu/open_access_pubs/895 | format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metabolism===
Genetic evidence suggests that the serovars can be divided into two groups – one which causes enteric infection and has a broad repertoire of metabolic capabilities, and one which usually causes invasive infection, often in a narrow range of hosts, and shows degradation of anaerobic metabolic pathways. It is thought that these metabolic capabilities are important for obtaining nutrients in the challenging and nutrient-limited inflamed gut environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nuccio SP, Bäumler AJ | title = Comparative analysis of Salmonella genomes identifies a metabolic network for escalating growth in the inflamed gut | journal = MBio | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = e00929–14 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24643865 | pmc = 3967523 | doi = 10.1128/mBio.00929-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
The serovars can be designated fully or in a shortened form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bacterio.cict.fr:80/salmonellanom.html | title=Salmonella nomenclature | date=March 19, 2005 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415011644/http://www.bacterio.cict.fr/salmonellanom.html | archive-date=2006-04-15 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The short form lists the genus, ''Salmonella'', which is followed by the capitalized and non-italicized serovar.  The full designation for ''Salmonella'' Typhi is ''Salmonella enterica'' subsp. ''enterica'', serovar Typhi.  Each serovar can have many strains, as well, which allows for a rapid increase in the total number of [[Antigenic variation|antigenically variable]] bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sanger.ac.uk:80/Projects/Salmonella/ | title=Salmonella spp. comparative sequencing | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114165837/http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Salmonella/ | archive-date=2007-11-14 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
{{main|Salmonellosis}}

Invasive strains of non-typhoidal salmonella, such as ''Salmonella'' Typhimurium ST313 have recently been labelled as causing emerging diseases in Africa. Key host immune deficiencies associated with HIV, malaria and malnutrition have contributed to a wide spread of this disease and the need to use expensive antimicrobial drugs in the poorest health services in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Feasey NA, Dougan G, Kingsley RA, Heyderman RS, Gordon MA | title = Invasive non-typhoidal salmonella disease: an emerging and neglected tropical disease in Africa | journal = Lancet | volume = 379 | issue = 9835 | pages = 2489–99 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22587967 | pmc = 3402672 | doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(11)61752-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But also bacterial factors, such as upregulated activity of the virulence gene ''pgtE'', due to a [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|single nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) in its promoter region, have been shown to have a great impact upon the pathogenesis of this particular ''Salmonella'' sequence type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hammarlöf DL, Kröger C, Owen SV, Canals R, Lacharme-Lora L, Wenner N, Schager AE, Wells TJ, Henderson IR, Wigley P, Hokamp K, Feasey NA, Gordon MA, Hinton JC | title = Salmonella | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 115 | issue = 11 | pages = E2614–E2623 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29487214 | pmc = 5856525 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1714718115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structural complexity''' is a science of [[applied mathematics]], that aims at relating fundamental physical or biological aspects of a [[complex system]] with the mathematical description of the morphological complexity that the system exhibits, by establishing rigorous relations between mathematical and physical properties of such system (Ricca 2005). 

Structural complexity emerges from all systems that display morphological organization (Nicolis &amp; Prigogine 1989). Filamentary structures, for instance, are an example of [[Lagrangian_coherent_structures |coherent structures]] that emerge, interact and evolve in many physical and biological systems, such as mass distribution in the [[Shape of the universe|Universe]], [[Vortex |vortex filaments]] in turbulent flows, [[neural networks]] in our brain and genetic material (such as [[DNA]]) in a cell. In general information on the degree of morphological [[Order_and_disorder_(physics) |disorder]] present in the system tells us something important about fundamental physical or biological processes.

Structural complexity methods are based on applications of [[differential geometry]] and [[topology]] (and in particular [[knot theory]]) to interpret physical properties of [[dynamical systems]] (Abraham &amp; Shaw 1992; Ricca 2009), such as relations between [[kinetic energy]] and tangles of vortex filaments in a turbulent flow or [[magnetic energy]] and braiding of magnetic fields in the solar corona, including aspects of [[topological fluid dynamics]].

{{Functions}}
In [[mathematics]], a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' from a [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' to a set ''Y'' is '''surjective''' (or '''onto'''), or a '''surjection''', if for every [[Element (mathematics)|element]] ''y'' in the [[codomain]] ''Y'' of ''f'' there is at least one element ''x'' in the [[domain of a function|domain]] ''X'' of ''f'' such that ''f''(''x'') = ''y''. It is not required that ''x'' be [[unique (mathematics)|unique]]; the function ''f'' may map one or more elements of ''X'' to the same element of ''Y''.

[[File:Surjection.svg|thumb|center|A surjective function from [[domain of a function|domain]] ''X'' to [[codomain]] ''Y''. The function is surjective because every point in the codomain is the value of ''f''(''x'') for at least one point ''x'' in the domain.]]

The term ''surjective'' and the related terms ''[[injective function|injective]]'' and ''[[bijective function|bijective]]'' were introduced by [[Nicolas Bourbaki]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://jeff560.tripod.com/i.html | title = Earliest Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics | contribution = Injection, Surjection and Bijection | publisher = Tripod |first=Jeff|last=Miller}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a group of mainly [[France|French]] 20th-century [[mathematician]]s who under this pseudonym wrote a series of books presenting an exposition of modern advanced mathematics, beginning in 1935. The French word ''[[wikt:sur#French|sur]]'' means ''over'' or ''above'' and relates to the fact that the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of the domain of a surjective function completely covers the function's codomain.

Any function induces a surjection by [[restriction of a function|restricting]] its codomain to its [[range of a function|range]]. Every surjective function has a [[Inverse function#Left and right inverses|right inverse]], and every function with a right inverse is necessarily a surjection. The [[function composition|composite]] of surjective functions is always surjective. Any function can be decomposed into a surjection and an injection.

==Definition==
{{details|topic=notation|Function (mathematics)#Notation}}
A '''surjective function''' is a [[function(mathematics)|function]] whose [[image (mathematics)|image]] is equal to its [[codomain]].  Equivalently, a function ''f'' with [[domain of a function|domain]] ''X'' and codomain ''Y'' is surjective if for every ''y'' in ''Y'' there exists at least one ''x'' in ''X'' with &lt;math&gt;f(x)=y&lt;/math&gt;. Surjections are sometimes denoted by a two-headed rightwards arrow ({{unichar|21A0|RIGHTWARDS TWO HEADED ARROW|ulink=Unicode}}),&lt;ref name="Unicode Arrows"&gt;{{cite web| title = Arrows – Unicode| url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2190.pdf| accessdate = 2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in ''f'' : ''X'' ↠ ''Y''.

Symbolically,

:If &lt;math&gt;f\colon X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is said to be surjective if

:&lt;math&gt;\forall y \in Y, \, \exists x \in X, \;\; f(x)=y&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
[[File:Codomain2.SVG|right|thumb|250px|'''A non-surjective function''' from [[domain of a function|domain]] ''X'' to [[codomain]] ''Y''. The smaller oval inside ''Y'' is the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] (also called [[range (mathematics)|range]]) of ''f''. This function is '''not''' surjective, because the image does not fill the whole codomain. In other words, ''Y'' is colored in a two-step process: First, for every ''x'' in ''X'', the point ''f''(''x'') is colored yellow; Second, all the rest of the points in ''Y'', that are not yellow, are colored blue. The function ''f'' is surjective only if there are no blue points.]]
For any set ''X'', the [[identity function]] id&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''X'' is surjective.

The function {{Nowrap|''f'' : '''Z''' → '''{0,1}'''}} defined by ''f''(''n'') = ''n'' '''[[Modular arithmetic|mod]]''' 2 (that is, [[even number|even]] [[integer]]s are mapped to 0 and [[odd number|odd]] integers to 1) is surjective.

The function {{Nowrap|''f'' : '''R''' → '''R'''}} defined by ''f''(''x'') = 2''x'' + 1 is surjective (and even [[bijective function|bijective]]), because for every [[real number]] ''y'' we have an ''x'' such that ''f''(''x'') = ''y'': an appropriate ''x'' is (''y'' − 1)/2.

The function {{Nowrap|''f'' : '''R''' → '''R'''}} defined by ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − 3''x'' is surjective, because the pre-image of any [[real number]] ''y'' is the solution set of the cubic polynomial equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − 3''x'' − ''y'' = 0 and every cubic polynomial with real coefficients has at least one real root. However, this function is not [[injective function|injective]] (and hence not [[bijective function|bijective]]) since e.g. the pre-image of ''y'' = 2 is {''x'' = −1, ''x'' = 2}. (In fact, the pre-image of this function for every ''y'',  −2 ≤ ''y'' ≤ 2 has more than one element.)

The function {{Nowrap|''g'' : '''R''' → '''R'''}} defined by {{Nowrap begin}}''g''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;{{Nowrap end}} is ''not'' surjective, because there is no real number ''x'' such that {{Nowrap begin}}''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1{{Nowrap end}}. However, the function {{Nowrap|''g'' : '''R''' → '''R{{sub|0}}{{sup|+}}'''}} defined by {{Nowrap begin}}''g''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;{{Nowrap end}} (with restricted codomain) ''is'' surjective because for every ''y'' in the nonnegative real codomain ''Y'' there is at least one ''x'' in the real domain ''X'' such that {{Nowrap begin}}''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''y''{{Nowrap end}}.

The [[natural logarithm]] function {{Nowrap|ln : &lt;nowiki&gt;(0,+∞)&lt;/nowiki&gt; → '''R'''}} is a surjective and even bijective mapping from the set of positive real numbers to the set of all real numbers. Its inverse, the [[exponential function]], is not surjective as its range is the set of positive real numbers, and its domain is usually defined to be the set of all real numbers. The [[matrix exponential]] is not surjective when seen as a map from the space of all ''n''×''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] to itself. It is, however, usually defined as a map from the space of all ''n''×''n'' matrices to the [[general linear group]] of degree ''n'', i.e. the [[group (mathematics)|group]] of all ''n''×''n'' [[invertible matrix|invertible matrices]]. Under this definition the matrix exponential is surjective for complex matrices, although still not surjective for real matrices.

The [[projection (set theory)|projection]] from a [[cartesian product]] {{Nowrap|''A'' × ''B''}} to one of its factors is surjective unless the other factor is empty.

In a 3D video game, vectors are projected onto a 2D flat screen by means of a surjective function.

Every element in the range is mapped onto from an element in the domain, by the rule ''f''. There may be a number of domain elements which map to the same range element. That is, every ''y'' in ''Y'' is mapped from an element ''x'' in ''X'', more than one ''x'' can map to the same ''y''. '''Left:''' Only one domain is shown which makes ''f'' surjective. '''Right:''' two possible domains ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are shown.]]

[[File:Non-surjective function2.svg|500px|thumb|right|'''Non-surjective functions''' in the Cartesian plane. Although some parts of the function are surjective, where elements ''y'' in ''Y'' do have a value ''x'' in ''X'' such that ''y'' = ''f''(''x''), some parts are not. '''Left:''' There is ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in ''Y'', but there is no ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in ''X'' such that ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). '''Right:''' There are ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in ''Y'', but there are no ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in ''X'' such that ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).]]

==Properties==
A function is [[bijective function|bijective]] if and only if it is both surjective and [[injective function|injective]].

If (as is often done) a function is identified with its [[graph of a function|graph]], then surjectivity is not a property of the function itself, but rather a property of the [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=T. M. Apostol|title=Mathematical Analysis|year=1981|publisher=Addison-Wesley|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is, the function together with its codomain. Unlike injectivity, surjectivity cannot be read off of the graph of the function alone.

===Surjections as right invertible functions===
The function {{Nowrap|''g'' : ''Y'' → ''X''}} is said to be a [[Inverse function#Left and right inverses|right inverse]] of the function {{Nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} if {{Nowrap begin}}''f''(''g''(''y'')) = ''y''{{Nowrap end}} for every ''y'' in ''Y'' (''g'' can be undone by ''f'').  In other words, ''g'' is a right inverse of ''f'' if the [[function composition|composition]] {{Nowrap|''f'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''g''}} of ''g'' and ''f'' in that order is the [[identity function]] on the domain ''Y'' of ''g''. The function ''g'' need not be a complete [[inverse function|inverse]] of ''f'' because the composition in the other order, {{Nowrap|''g'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''f''}}, may not be the identity function on the domain ''X'' of ''f''. In other words, ''f'' can undo or "''reverse''" ''g'', but cannot necessarily be reversed by it.

Every function with a right inverse is necessarily a surjection. The proposition that every surjective function has a right inverse is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]].

If {{Nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is surjective and ''B'' is a [[subset]] of ''Y'', then {{Nowrap begin}}''f''(''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B'')) = ''B''{{Nowrap end}}. Thus, ''B'' can be recovered from its [[preimage]] {{Nowrap|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B'')}}.

For example, in the first illustration, above, there is some function ''g'' such that ''g''(''C'') = 4.  There is also some function ''f'' such that ''f''(4) = ''C''.  It doesn't matter that ''g''(''C'') can also equal 3; it only matters that ''f'' "reverses" ''g''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Surjections as epimorphisms===
A function {{Nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is surjective if and only if it is [[right-cancellative]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

|isbn=978-0-486-45026-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; given any functions {{Nowrap|''g'',''h'' : ''Y'' → ''Z''}}, whenever {{Nowrap begin}}''g'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''f'' = ''h'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''f''{{Nowrap end}}, then {{Nowrap begin}}''g'' = ''h''{{Nowrap end}}. This property is formulated in terms of functions and their [[function composition|composition]] and can be generalized to the more general notion of the [[morphism]]s of a [[category (mathematics)|category]] and their composition. Right-cancellative morphisms are called [[epimorphism]]s. Specifically, surjective functions are precisely the epimorphisms in the [[category of sets]]. The prefix ''epi'' is derived from the Greek preposition ''ἐπί'' meaning ''over'', ''above'', ''on''.

Any morphism with a right inverse is an epimorphism, but the converse is not true in general. A right inverse ''g'' of a morphism ''f'' is called a [[section (category theory)|section]] of ''f''. A morphism with a right inverse is called a [[split epimorphism]].

===Surjections as binary relations===
Any function with domain ''X'' and codomain ''Y'' can be seen as a [[left-total relation|left-total]] and [[right-unique relation|right-unique]] binary relation between ''X'' and ''Y'' by identifying it with its [[function graph]]. A surjective function with domain ''X'' and codomain ''Y'' is then a binary relation between ''X'' and ''Y'' that is right-unique and both left-total and [[right-total relation|right-total]].

===Cardinality of the domain of a surjection===
The [[cardinality]] of the domain of a surjective function is greater than or equal to the cardinality of its codomain: If {{Nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is a surjective function, then ''X'' has at least as many elements as ''Y'', in the sense of [[cardinal number]]s.   (The proof appeals to the [[axiom of choice]] to show that a function
{{Nowrap|''g'' : ''Y'' → ''X''}} satisfying ''f''(''g''(''y'')) = ''y'' for all ''y'' in ''Y'' exists. ''g'' is easily seen to be injective, thus the [[Cardinal number#Formal definition|formal definition]] of |''Y''| ≤ |''X''| is satisfied.)

Specifically, if both ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[finite set|finite]] with the same number of elements, then {{Nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is surjective if and only if ''f'' is [[injective]].

Given two sets ''X'' and ''Y'', the notation {{nowrap|''X'' ≤&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; ''Y''}} is used to say that either ''X'' is empty or that there is a surjection from ''Y'' onto ''X''. Using the axiom of choice one can show that {{nowrap|''X'' ≤&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; ''Y''}} and {{nowrap|''Y'' ≤&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; ''X''}} together imply that {{nowrap begin}}|''Y''| = |''X''|,{{nowrap end}} a variant of the [[Schröder–Bernstein theorem]].

===Composition and decomposition===
The [[function composition|composite]] of surjective functions is always surjective: If ''f'' and ''g'' are both surjective, and the codomain of ''g'' is equal to the domain of ''f'', then {{Nowrap|''f'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''g''}} is surjective. Conversely, if {{Nowrap|''f'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''g''}} is surjective, then ''f'' is surjective (but ''g'', the function applied first, need not be). These properties generalize from surjections in the [[category of sets]] to any [[epimorphism]]s in any [[category (mathematics)|category]].

Any function can be decomposed into a surjection and an [[injective function|injection]]: For any function {{Nowrap|''h'' : ''X'' → ''Z''}} there exist a surjection {{Nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} and an injection {{Nowrap|''g'' : ''Y'' → ''Z''}} such that {{Nowrap begin}}''h'' = ''g'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''f''{{Nowrap end}}. To see this, define ''Y'' to be the set of [[preimage]]s {{Nowrap|''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''z'')}} where ''z'' is in {{Nowrap|''h''(''X'')}}. These preimages are [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] and [[partition of a set|partition]] ''X''. Then ''f'' carries each ''x'' to the element of ''Y'' which contains it, and ''g'' carries each element of ''Y'' to the point in ''Z'' to which ''h'' sends its points. Then ''f'' is surjective since it is a projection map, and ''g'' is injective by definition.

===Induced surjection and induced bijection===
Any function induces a surjection by restricting its codomain to its range. Any surjective function induces a bijection defined on a [[quotient set|quotient]] of its domain by collapsing all arguments mapping to a given fixed image. More precisely, every surjection {{Nowrap|''f'' : ''A'' → ''B''}} can be factored as a projection followed by a bijection as follows. Let ''A''/~ be the [[equivalence class]]es of ''A'' under the following [[equivalence relation]]: ''x'' ~ ''y'' if and only if ''f''(''x'') = ''f''(''y''). Equivalently, ''A''/~ is the set of all preimages under ''f''. Let ''P''(~) : ''A'' → ''A''/~ be the [[projection map]] which sends each ''x'' in ''A'' to its equivalence class [''x'']&lt;sub&gt;~&lt;/sub&gt;, and let ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''A''/~ → ''B'' be the well-defined function given by ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt;([''x'']&lt;sub&gt;~&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''f''(''x''). Then ''f'' = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt; o ''P''(~).

{{Refimprove|date=September 2007}}'''Surprise''' ({{audio|En-us-surprise.ogg|pronunciation}}) is a brief mental and physiological state, a [[startle response]] experienced by animals and humans as the result of an unexpected event. Surprise can have any [[Valence (psychology)|valence]]; that is, it can be neutral/moderate, pleasant, unpleasant, positive, or negative. Surprise can occur in varying levels of intensity ranging from very-surprised, which may induce the [[fight-or-flight response]], or little-surprise that elicits a less intense response to the stimuli.

[[File:Förvåning - Ystad-2017.jpg|thumb|A child looks at her iPad (not pictured) with surprise.]]
Surprise is intimately connected to the idea of acting in accordance with a set of rules. When the rules of reality generating events of daily life separate from the rule-of-thumb expectations, surprise is the outcome. Surprise represents the difference between expectations and reality, the gap between our assumptions and expectations about worldly events and the way that those events actually turn out.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Casti]]; ''Complexification:  Explaining a Paradoxical World through the Science of Surprise .'' New York: HarperCollins, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; This gap can be deemed an important foundation on which new findings are based since surprises can make people aware of their own [[ignorance]]. The acknowledgement of ignorance, in turn, can mean a window to new knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthias Gross]]; ''Ignorance and Surprise: Science, Society, and Ecological Design.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ReverseClock.webm|thumb|right|Violation of expectancies.]]

Surprise can also occur due to a violation of expectancies.  In the specific case of interpersonal communication, the [[Expectancy Violation Theory]] (EVT) says that three factors influence a person's expectations: interactant variables, environmental variables, and variables related to the nature of the interaction or environmental variables.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burgoon | first1 = J. K. | last2 = Jones | first2 = S. B. | year = 1976 | title = Toward a Theory of Personal Space Expectations and Their Violations | url = | journal = Human Communication Research | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 131–146 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1976.tb00706.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Interactant variables involve traits of the persons involved in the communication and in this instance the communication leading to surprise, including: race, sex, socio-economic status, age, and appearance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Environmental variables that effect the communication of surprise include: [[proxemics]], [[chronemics]], and the nature of the surroundings of the interaction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Interaction variables that influence surprise include: [[social norms]], [[cultural norms]], physiological influences, biological influences and unique individual behavioral patterns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Surprise may occur due to a violation of one, two, or a combination of all three factors.

Surprise does not always have to have a negative valence. EVT proposes that expectancy's will influence the outcome of the communication as a confirmation, behaviors within the expected range, or violation, behaviors outside the expected range.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; EVT also postulates that positive interactions will increase the level of attraction of the violator, where as negative violations decrease the attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burgoon | first1 = J. K. | last2 = Hale | first2 = J. L. | year = 1988 | title = Nonverbal Expectancy Violations: Model Elaboration and Application to Immediacy Behaviors | url = | journal = Communication Monographs | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 58–79 | doi=10.1080/03637758809376158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive violations would then cause positive surprise, such as a surprise birthday party, and negative violations would cause negative surprise, such as a parking ticket.  Positive violations of surprise may enhance credibility, power, attraction, and persuasiveness, where as negative violations of surprise may reduce credibility, power, attraction, and persuasiveness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Surprise is expressed in the face by the following features:

* Eyebrows that are raised so they become curved and high.
* Horizontal wrinkles across the forehead.
* Open eyelids: the upper lid is raised and the lower lid is drawn down, often exposing the white [[sclera]] above and below the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]].
* Pupil dilation [[mydriasis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = CJ | year = 1981 | title = The pupillary light reflex in normal subjects | journal = Br J Ophthalmol | volume = 65 | issue = 11| pages = 754–9 | doi = 10.1136/bjo.65.11.754 | pmid = 7326222 | pmc=1039657}}&lt;/ref&gt; or pupil constriction [[miosis]]
* Dropped jaw so that the lips and teeth are parted, with no tension around the mouth.

Spontaneous, involuntary surprise is often expressed for only a fraction of a second. It may be followed immediately by the emotion of [[fear]], [[joy]] or [[confusion]]. The intensity of the surprise is associated with how much the jaw drops, but the mouth may not open at all in some cases. The raising of the eyebrows, at least momentarily, is the most distinctive and predictable sign of surprise.&lt;ref&gt;Ekman, P. &amp; Friesen, W. V. (1975). ''Unmasking the face''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the [[facial feedback hypothesis]] (that facial display is necessary in the experience of emotion or a major determinant of feelings), in the case of surprise, some research has shown a strong [[wikt:dissociation|lack of connection]] between the facial display of surprise and the actual experience of surprise. This suggests that there are variations in the expression of surprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reisenzein|first1=Rainer|author2=Bordgen, Sandra |author3=Holtbernd, Thomas |author4= Matz, Denise |title=Evidence for strong dissociation between emotion and facial displays: The case of surprise|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=August 2006|volume=91|issue=2|pages=295–315|url=http://www.phil.uni-greifswald.de/fileadmin/mediapool/psychologie/lehrstuhl_allg2/Reisenzein_et_Al2006_Surprise_Expression.pdf|accessdate=October 11, 2011|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.91.2.295 |pmid=16881766}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that surprise is an envelope term for both the startle response and also disbelief. More recent research shows that rasing of the eyebrows does provide facial feedback to disbelief but not to the startle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Exploring the positive and negative implications of facial feedback.|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/emo/12/4/852/|website = APA PsycNET|accessdate = 2015-11-02|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pupil dilation and constriction can determine the valence of surprise from the action to the reaction of the individual.  Positive valence to surprise is shown through a dilation or expansion of the pupil, where as negative valence in surprise is associated with pupil constriction.&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Eckhard H.; Polt, James M. (5 August 1960), "Pupil Size as Related to Interest Value of Visual Stimuli", Science 132 (3423): 349–50,doi:10.1126/science.132.3423.349, {{PMID|14401489}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, newer studies show pupil dilation for negative as well as positive stimuli, indicating a general autonomous arousal associated with pupil dilation and not affective valence.&lt;ref&gt;Partala, Timo; Surakka, Veikko. (2003), "Pupil size variation as an indication of affective processing", International journal of human-computer studies 59.1 : 185–198&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-verbal responses to surprise can also be affected by voice inflection, distance, time, environment, volume, rate, quality, pitch, speaking style, and even the level of eye contact made by an individual trying the cause a surprise.&lt;ref&gt;Burgoon, J.K., Dunbar, N.E, &amp; Segrin, C. (2002). Non-verbal influence "The persuasion handbook". p.445-465.&lt;/ref&gt;  These non-verbal cues help to define whether the perceived surprise will have a positive or negative valence and to what degree the surprise will be induced by the individual.

== Verbal responses ==

Linguistics may play a role in the formulation of surprise.  The [[Language expectancy theory]] (LET) states that people develop norms and expectations concerning appropriate usage of a language in a given situation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Burgoon, M. &amp; Miller. (1979). Language expectancy theory. ''The persuasion handbook''.p. 177-133&lt;/ref&gt;  When norms or expectations of verbal language are violated surprise may occur.  The EVT model supports that expectations can be violated verbally&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and this violation may cause a surprise within the individual.  Expectations of verbal language that may lead to surprise may include but are not limited to, expletives, shouts, screams, and gasps.

The aforementioned expectations of verbal language are more closely associated to negative expectancies of surprise, but positive surprise can occur from verbal interaction as well.  A positive violation of expectations that could result in a positive surprise may include a low credibility source making a persuasive argument that leads to the change of beliefs or emotions thus enhancing the speakers credibility.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The move from a low credibility source to a high credibility source can elicit a positive surprise among individuals.  The act of being persuaded by said speaker can also elicit a positive surprise, as an individual may have perceived the speaker as having too low of a credibility to elicit change and the change of beliefs or emotion then causes surprise.

== Physiological responses ==
[[File:Daumier dimanche au musee.jpg|thumb|''Sunday at the Museum'', [[Honoré Daumier]]]]

The physiological response of surprise falls under the category of the [[startle response]]. The main function of surprise or the startle response is to interrupt an ongoing action and reorient attention to a new, possibly significant event. There is an automatic redirection of focus to the new stimuli and, for a brief moment, this causes tenseness in the muscles, especially the neck muscles. Studies show that this response happens extremely fast, with information (in this case a loud noise) reaching the [[pons]] within 3 to 8 ms and the full startle reflex occurring in less than two tenths of a second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalat|first=James W.|title=Biological Psychology|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, Calif.|pages=357–358|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the startle response is strongly elicited through surprise then it will bring on the [[fight-or-flight response]], which is a perceived harmful event, attack, or threat to survival&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, Walter (1932). Wisdom of the Body. United States: W.W. Norton &amp; Company. {{ISBN|0393002055}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that causes a release of adrenaline for a boost of energy as a means to escape or fight.  This response generally has a negative valance in terms of surprise.

Surprise has one core appraisal-appraising something as new and unexpected-but new appraisals can shift the experience of surprise to another. Appraising an event as new predicts surprise, but the appraisal of the [[coping mechanism]] predicts the response beyond surprise, such as [[confusion]] or interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silva|first=Paul J.|title=Looking Past Pleasure: Anger, Confusion, Disgust, Pride, Surprise, and Other Unusual Aesthetic Emotions|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts.|year=2009|volume=3|number=1|pages=48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Familiarity ==

As individuals become more accustomed to particular types of surprise, over time the level of surprise will decrease in intensity.  This does not necessarily mean that an individual, for instance, will not be surprised during the jump scene of a scary movie, it implies that the individual may expect the jump scene due to familiarity with scary movies, thus lowering the level of surprise.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The EVT model helps to support this claim because as individuals become more accustomed to a situation or communication, it becomes less and less likely that the situation or communication will cause a violation of expectation, and without violating an expectation, surprise cannot occur.

In general the application of a systematic process is regarded as a means of management aimed at reducing the number and severity of mistakes, errors and failures due to either [[human error|human]] or [[mechanical failure|technological]] functions involved. 

Use of systematic process in [[strategic planning]] has been both challenged, due to rapid change in market conditions, and advocated as a source of improvement.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Grünig, ''Process-based Strategic Planning'', Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 2006, pp.45-46&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "Many OECD countries have a transparent and systematic process of public consultation to enhance the quality of the regulatory process by guaranteeing that the impact on citizens and businesses is taken into account."&lt;ref&gt;''China: defining the boundary between the market and the state'', OECD Reviews of Regulatory Reform, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2009, p.113&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14566">'''T_Visionarium''' is an art installation by [[Neil Brown (artist)|Neil Brown]], [[Dennis Del Favero]], [[Jeffrey Shaw]] and [[Peter Weibel]] developed through the [[iCinema]] Centre for Interactive Cinema Research at The [[University of New South Wales]] in co-operation with [[Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie|ZKM Center for Art and Media]], Karlsruhe.

In contrast to conventional cinema, where viewers passively watch a singular linear story unfold on a flat screen, T_Visionarium allows viewers to explore and edit a multitude of stories, in 3 dimensions, on a 360-degree fully surrounding screen.

T_Visionarium takes two forms. The first version, T_Visionarium I (2003), is set within an inflatable dome, named EVE or the Extended Virtual Environment, 12 metres wide and 9 metres high. This immersive environment was invented by Shaw in 1993. Once inside EVE viewers wear a head mounted position tracking device and headphones and step onto a control platform in the middle of the dome. This interface device enables the viewer's head movements to control the movement of the projection system. By moving the direction of their head, and hence their gaze, viewers navigate around the images projected onto the interior of the dome.

The second version, T_Visionarium II (2008), is set within AVIE, or the Advanced Visualisation and Interaction Environment. AVIE is the world's first 360 degree stereoscopic projection cinema &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. AVIE is a 120-square metre circular screen that surrounds the audience and provides the environment for a wholly immersive three-dimensional cinematic experience. AVIE allows audiences to wander at will through the projection space without having to sit in a fixed location as in a conventional cinema or to stand on a control platform as in T_Visionarium I, interacting with the projected information as if they are really there &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Viewers wearing three-dimensional glasses step inside a cylindrical cinema screen measuring four metres high and 10 metres in diameter. Twelve digital projectors create a high-resolution stereoscopic 3D image on this screen, and the audio is spatially enhanced via a 24- channel surround sound system.

==iCinema==
The Director of the Centre is Dennis Del Favero. It was founded in 2002 by Jeffrey Shaw, Dennis Del Favero and Neil Brown and is a unique multi-disciplinary joint venture of the College for Fine Arts, the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at The University of New South Wales. The iCinema Centre comprises over 20 research staff and 16 research students working together across the disciplines of [[new media]], [[aesthetics]], [[experimental art]], [[film theory]], multimedia design, [[computer science]], [[artificial intelligence]] and [[software]] and [[computer hardware|hardware]] engineering.

The iCinema research program focuses on research into digital interactivity for benchmark applications across the arts, culture and industry. This includes research into: 
* Interactive Narrative Systems, involving the theoretical and experimental investigation of the differentiated structures of narrative brought about by the digital;
* Immersive Visualisation Systems, involving the research and development of mixed reality environments;
* Distributed Interface Systems, involving the integration of distributed multi-user environment within networked systems; and
* Theories of Interactive Narrative Systems, involving the inquiry into digital systems in the context of the contemporary world.

==Funding==
The T_Visionarium project was funded by an [[Australian Research Council]] Discovery Grant, and co-produced with the [[Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie|ZKM Center for Art and Media]], Karlsruhe, Germany
.

==Exhibitions==
T_Visionarium I was premiered at EuroLille, Lille, France, as part of the 2004 European Cultural Capital Lille Festival. Since then the work has been exhibited at Casa Dell'Architettura, Rome, Italy, as part of the 2006 La Rivoluzione Algorithmica exhibition. T_Visionarium II was premiered at the iCinema Scientia Facility at The University of New South Wales in January 2008 as part of the [[Sydney Festival]]. In November 2009, T_Visionarium was exhibited in Amsterdam, at the [[Zuiderkerk]].

==T_Visionarium I and T_Visionarium II==
For the T_Visionarium I project researchers at iCinema captured 24 hours of European television, for T_Visionarium II 28 hours of digital free to air [[Australian]] television, both over a period of one week. This footage was segmented and converted into a massive database, in the latter case containing over 20,000 video clips.

Each video clip was then tagged with descriptors known as [[metadata]], which define the properties of the clip. Information can be encoded such as the gender of the actors, the dominant emotions they are expressing, the pace of the scene, and specific actions such as standing up, lying down, or telephoning. Having the video data segmented in this way deconstructs the television's original linear narrative into components that then become building blocks that the viewer can associate and re-assemble in an infinite number of ways &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

In T_Visionarium I, the viewer is able to search this database of television recordings via a touch screen menu using a keyword search. The software then reassembles these clips over the entire projection surface of EVE, generating relationships between clips based on the viewer's keyword search.

In T_Visionarium II over three hundred video clips are simultaneously displayed and distributed around AVIE's circular screen. Using a specially designed interface, the viewer can trigger and reassemble clips from the database by selecting a particular video clip from those displayed. The archive of video clips then reassembles themselves within the 3D immersive space of AVIE based on their relationship to this selection. Those clips with the strongest relationship to the selection are triggered from the archive and cluster around the particular clip, whilst those with weaker relationships shift away from the clip &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

Rather than the keyword search of T_Visionarium I, T_Visionarium II allows for associative and affective searches. This latter search is based on the visual or emotional characteristics of the clip selected, rather than based on semantic information.

The decontextualisation of the television clips fractures the medium's imaging of the world. Rather than the definite representation of the world proposed by television's linear narrative logic, in T_Visionarium, the viewer is confronted with a world represented as a complex of data, of emergent narrative events, rather than mediated as a prefabricated linear narrative &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Aesthetics==
The T_Visionarium project is framed by the concept of aesthetic transcription, that is, the way new meaning can be produced is based on how content moves from one expressive medium to another &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. This is seen throughout art history where an artist recreates motifs from another artist's work (for an instance of this one can cite the apparent evolution from the goddess figure, say Venus, in archaic Greek sculpture to its conception in the classical period through to its appearance in renaissance oil painting). The concept of aesthetic transcription treats each adoption of techniques or cultural data as differentiated in itself, as something new, rather than as an imitation of what went before &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;.  In T_Visionarium, the digital allows the transcription of televisual data, decontextualising the original data, and reconstituting it within a new artifact. In other words, the archiving abilities of the digital allow data to be changed from its original conception as firstly, new narrative relationships generated between the multitudes of archived data and secondly, as meaningful narrative events that emerge as a result of viewer interaction.

Following [[Roland Barthes]]' famous essay "The Death of the Author", this work, rather than being the product of a single author, allows aesthetic negotiations to occur between audience and text. It enables an emergent bond between artist, audience, and the work. In this way, T_Visionarium provides not just a recognition of the artist and the audience's part in the formation of art, but also the constitutive role of the particular media &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;. In T_Visionarium, the artist sets the initial conditions for interaction and the viewer and the technology are responsible for the formation of the art event.

The T_Visionarium project also proposes a re-evaluation of narrative in the digital. Del Favero, Brown, Shaw and Weibel have explained that traditionally narrative is conceptualized as mono-temporal and linear whereas interactive narrative is commonly understood as non-linear. In contrast to this, in T_Visionarium narrative is to be understood as "multi-temporal", a concept that alleviates the sharp distinction between linear and non-linear narratives &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. They explain this concept as the mingling of virtual time and real time. This occurs in T_Visionarium as the viewer searches the televisual database in virtual time and experiences the consequences of this navigation in real time. Tim Barker builds on this description to situate the "multi-temporal" in T_Visionarium as the consequence of the viewer's ability to access multiple temporal episodes simultaneously. As each television clip represents different time periods, the result of accessing these all at once is what he refers to as a "multi-temporal duration", a duration of time that is made up of multiple and differentiated representations of time &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;. In this model of interaction, the viewer and the database form "…a digital ecology able to generate unprecedented aesthetic and social meanings" &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;. In other words, the viewer and the database of T_Visionarium collaborate to generate the narrative events that constitute T_Visionarium.

==Applications==
The unique way that T_Visionarium uses AVIE to navigate and articulate vast amounts of audiovisual data is significant for the cultural, entertainment, education and industrial sectors &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;. Particular examples of this are the licensing of AVIE systems to Mines Rescue Pty Ltd as a mines safety training device &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Software==

'''United States customary units''' are a [[Units of measurement|system of measurements]] commonly used in the [[United States]]. The '''United States customary system''' ('''USCS''' or '''USC''') developed from [[English units]] which were in use in the [[British Empire]] before the U.S. became an independent country. However, the United Kingdom's system of measures was overhauled in 1824 to create the [[imperial system]], changing the definitions of some units.  Therefore, while many U.S. units are essentially similar to their Imperial counterparts, there are significant [[comparison of the imperial and US customary measurement systems|differences between the systems]].

The majority of U.S. customary units were redefined in terms of the [[metre|meter]] and the [[kilogram]] with the [[Mendenhall Order]] of 1893 and, in practice, for many years before.&lt;ref name="Mendenhall"&gt;[[Thomas Corwin Mendenhall|T.C. Mendenhall]], Superintendent of Standard Weights and Measures. [http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP447/app3.pdf Order of April 5, 1893] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930180925/http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP447/app3.pdf |date=September 30, 2012}}, published as Appendix&amp;nbsp;6 to the Report for 1893 of the [[US Coast and Geodetic Survey|Coast and Geodetic Survey]].&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions were refined by the [[international yard and pound]] agreement of 1959.&lt;ref name="FR59-5442"&gt;Astin, A.V., Karo, H.A. and Mueller, F.H. (June 25, 1959). Doc 59-5442, "[http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/FedRegister/FRdoc59-5442.pdf Refinement of Values for the Yard and the Pound]." ''[[Federal Register]]''. When reading the document note that 999,998 = 3937 × 254.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Americans primarily use customary units in commercial activities, as well as for personal and social use. In science, medicine, many sectors of industry, and some of government and military, metric units are used. The [[International System of Units]] (SI), the modern form of the [[metric system]], is preferred for many uses by the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/pml/wmd/metric/index.cfm Laws and Metric Program]. U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; For newer units of measure where there is no traditional customary unit, international units are used, sometimes mixed with customary units, such as [[electrical resistance]] of wire expressed in [[ohm]]s (SI) per thousand feet.

==History==
{{See also|Imperial and US customary measurement systems|Comparison of the imperial and US customary measurement systems}}

The United States system of units is similar to the British [[Imperial units|imperial system]].&lt;ref&gt;"English units of measurement". ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'' 6th ed. 2001-2007. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080714214207/http://www.bartleby.com/65/en/Englsh-u.html archived copy].&lt;/ref&gt; Both systems are derived from [[English units]], a system which had evolved over the millennia before American independence, and which had its roots in Roman and Anglo-Saxon units.

The customary system was championed by the U.S.-based International Institute for Preserving and Perfecting Weights and Measures in the late 19th century. Advocates of the customary system saw the French Revolutionary, or metric, system as atheistic.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Gardner|title=Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X0HCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA180|date=4 May 2012|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-13162-7|pages=180–}}&lt;/ref&gt; An auxiliary of the Institute in Ohio published a poem with wording such as "down with every 'metric' scheme" and "A perfect inch, a perfect pint".&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt; One adherent of the customary system called it "a just weight and a just measure, which alone are acceptable to the Lord".&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;

The U.S. government passed the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, which made the [[metric system]] "the preferred system of weights and measures for U.S. trade and commerce".  The legislation states that the federal government has a responsibility to assist industry as it ''voluntarily'' converts to the metric system, i.e., [[Metrication in the United States|metrification]]. This is most evident in U.S. labeling requirements on food products, where SI units are almost always presented alongside customary units.  According to the [[CIA Factbook]], the United States is one of three nations (along with [[Liberia]] and [[Burma]]) that have not adopted the metric system as their official system of weights and measures.&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/appendix/appendix-g.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher= [[Central Intelligence Agency]] |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter=Appendix G - Weights and Measures |date= |accessdate= August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. customary units are widely used on consumer products and in industrial manufacturing. Metric units are standard in science, medicine, as well as many sectors of industry and government, including the [[U.S. armed forces|military]].&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook/&gt; There are anecdotal objections to the use of metric units in carpentry and the building trades, on the basis that it is easier to remember an integer number of inches plus a fraction than a measurement in millimeters,&lt;ref&gt;Robyn Williams (February 8, 1998) [http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/ockhamsrazor/trouble-with-the-metric-system/3552102 "Trouble with the Metric System"]. Australian ''Radio National'', Ockham's Razor.&lt;/ref&gt; or that foot-inch measurements are more suitable when distances are frequently divided into halves, thirds and quarters, often in parallel. The metric system also lacks a parallel to the foot.&lt;ref name="Tenner"&gt;Ed Tenner, (May 2005).

For measuring length, the U.S. customary system uses the [[inch]], [[Foot (length)|foot]], [[yard]], and [[mile]], which are the only four customary length measurements in everyday use. Since July 1, 1959, these have been defined on the basis of 1&amp;nbsp;yard&amp;nbsp;= 0.9144&amp;nbsp;meters except for some applications in surveying.&lt;ref name="FR59-5442" /&gt; The U.S., the [[United Kingdom]] and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries agreed on this definition, and so it is often termed ''international measure''.

When international measure was introduced in the English-speaking countries, the basic [[geodetic datum]] in North America was the [[North American Datum]] of 1927 (NAD27), which had been constructed by [[triangulation]] based on the definition of the foot in the [[Mendenhall Order]] of 1893, that is 1&amp;nbsp;foot&amp;nbsp;= {{sfrac|1200|3937}}&amp;nbsp;meters: this definition was retained for data derived from NAD27, but renamed the ''US survey foot'' to distinguish it from the international foot.&lt;ref name="FR59-5442" /&gt; For most applications, the difference between the two definitions is insignificant&amp;nbsp;– one international foot is exactly 0.999998 of a US survey foot, for a difference of about {{sfrac|1|8}}&amp;nbsp;inch (3&amp;nbsp;mm) per mile&amp;nbsp;– but it affects the definition of the [[State Plane Coordinate System]]s (SPCSs), which can stretch over hundreds of miles.&lt;ref name="NGS-FAQ"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#Feet |title= Frequently Asked Questions about the National Geodetic Survey |year= |work= [[National Geodetic Survey]] |accessdate= May 16, 2009 |contribution= What are the 'official' conversions that are used by NGS to convert 1) meters to inches, and 2) meters to feet?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NAD27 was replaced in the 1980s by the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83), which is defined in meters. The SPCSs were also updated, but the [[National Geodetic Survey]] left the decision of which (if any) definition of the foot to use to the individual states. All SPCSs are defined in meters, but seven states also have SPCSs defined in US survey feet and an eighth state in international feet: the other 42&amp;nbsp;states use only meter-based SPCSs.&lt;ref name="NGS-FAQ" /&gt;

State legislation is also important for determining the conversion factor to be used for everyday land surveying and real estate transactions, although the difference (2&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]]) is of no practical significance given the precision of normal surveying measurements over short distances (usually much less than a mile). Twenty-four states have legislated that surveying measures should be based on the US survey foot, eight have legislated that they be made on the basis of the international foot, and eighteen have not specified the conversion factor from metric units.&lt;ref name="NGS-FAQ" /&gt;

The most widely used area unit with a name unrelated to any length unit is the [[acre]]. The National Institute of Standards and Technology contends that customary area units are defined in terms of the square survey foot, not the square international foot.&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt; Conversion factors are based on Astin (July 27, 1968)&lt;ref&gt;Astin, A.

The [[cubic inch]], [[cubic foot]] and [[cubic yard]] are commonly used for measuring volume. In addition, there is one group of units for measuring volumes of liquids, and one for measuring [[dry volume|volumes of dry material]].

Other than the cubic inch, cubic foot and cubic yard, these units are differently sized from the units in the [[imperial system]], although the names of the units are similar. Also, while the U.S. has separate systems for measuring the volumes of liquids and dry material, the imperial system has one set of units for both.

One US fluid ounce is {{frac|1|16}} of a US pint, {{frac|1|32}} of a US quart, and {{frac|1|128}} of a US gallon. The teaspoon, tablespoon, and cup are defined in terms of a fluid ounce as {{frac| 1|6}}, {{frac|1|2}}, and 8 fluid ounces.  The fluid ounce derives its name originally from being the volume of one ounce [[avoirdupois]] of water, but in the US it is defined as {{frac|1|128}} of a US gallon. Consequently, a fluid ounce of water weighs about 1.041 ounces avoirdupois.

The saying "a pint's a pound the world around" refers to 16 US fluid ounces of water weighing approximately (about 4% more than) one pound avoirdupois. An imperial pint of water weighs a pound and a quarter (20&amp;nbsp;oz).

There are varying standards for [[Barrel (unit)|barrel]] for some specific commodities, including 31 gal for beer, 40 gal for whiskey or kerosene, and 42 gal for petroleum.  The general standard for liquids is 31.5 gal or half a hogshead.  The common 55 gallon size of [[drum (container)|drum]] for storing and transporting various products and wastes is sometimes confused with a barrel, though it is not a standard measure.

In the U.S., single servings of beverages are usually measured in fluid ounces. Milk is usually sold in half pints (8 fluid ounces), pints, quarts, half gallons, and gallons. Water volume for sinks, bathtubs, ponds, swimming pools, etc., is usually stated in gallons or cubic feet.  Quantities of gases are usually given in cubic feet (at one atmosphere).

Minims, drams and gill are rarely used currently. The gill is often referred to as a "half-cup".

[[Dry volume]] is measured on a separate system, although many of the names remain the same. Small fruits and vegetables are often sold in dry pints and dry quarts. The US dry gallon is less commonly used, and was not included in the handbook that many states recognize as the authority on measurement law.&lt;ref name=HB44&gt;101st Conference on Weights and Measures 2016.

There have historically been five different English systems of mass: [[Pound (mass)#Tower pound|tower]], [[apothecaries' system|apothecaries']], [[troy weight|troy]], [[avoirdupois system|avoirdupois]], and [[metric system|metric]]. Of these, the avoirdupois weight is the most common system used in the U.S., although Troy weight is still used to weigh precious metals. Apothecaries weight—once used by pharmacies—has been largely replaced by metric measurements. Tower weight fell out of use in England (due to legal prohibition in 1527) centuries ago, and was never used in the U.S. The [[imperial units|imperial]] system, which is still used for some measures in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries, is based on avoirdupois, with variations from U.S. customary units larger than a pound.

The pound avoirdupois, which forms the basis of the U.S. customary system of mass, is defined as exactly {{val|453.59237|u=[[gram]]s}} by agreement between the U.S., the United Kingdom, and other English-speaking countries in 1959. Other units of mass are defined in terms of it.

The avoirdupois pound is legally defined as a measure of [[mass]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Publications/upload/AppendC-09-HB44-FINAL.pdf NIST Handbook 44, Appendix C, ''General Tables of Units of Measurement'', page C-6 ''Avoirdupois Units of Mass''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018070228/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Publications/upload/AppendC-09-HB44-FINAL.pdf |date=2011-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the name pound is also applied to measures of [[Force (physics)|force]]. For instance, in many contexts, the [[Pound (mass)|pound]] avoirdupois is used as a unit of mass, but in some contexts, the term "pound" is used to refer to "[[pound-force]]". The [[slug (unit)|slug]] is another unit of mass derived from pound-force.

Troy weight, avoirdupois weight, and apothecaries' weight are all built from the same basic unit, the grain, which is the same in all three systems. However, while each system has some overlap in the names of their units of measure (all have ounces and pounds), the relationship between the grain and these other units within each system varies. For example, in apothecary and troy weight, the pound and ounce are the same, but are different from the pound and ounce in avoirdupois in terms of their relationships to grains and to each other. The systems also have different units between the grain and ounce (apothecaries' has scruple and [[dram (unit)|dram]], troy has [[pennyweight]], and avoirdupois has just dram, sometimes spelled ''drachm'').  The dram in avoirdupois weighs just under half of the dram in apothecaries'. The [[fluid dram]] unit of volume is based on the weight of 1 dram of water in the apothecaries' system.

To alleviate confusion, it is typical when publishing non-avoirdupois weights to mention the name of the system along with the unit. Precious metals, for example, are often weighed in "troy ounces", because just "ounce" would be more likely to be assumed to mean an avoirdupois ounce.

For the pound and smaller units, the U.S. customary system and the British imperial system are identical. However, they differ when dealing with units larger than the pound. The definition of the pound avoirdupois in the imperial system is identical to that in the U.S. customary system.

In the U.S., only the ounce, pound and short ton&amp;nbsp;– known in the country simply as the ton&amp;nbsp;– are commonly used, though the hundredweight is still used in agriculture and shipping. The grain is used to describe the mass of propellant and projectiles in small arms [[ammunition]]. It was also used to measure medicine and other very small masses.

===Grain measures===
In agricultural practice, a [[bushel]] is a fixed volume of 2150.42 cubic inches. The mass of grain will therefore vary according to density. Some nominal weight examples are:{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}
* 1 bushel (corn)  = 56&amp;nbsp;lb = 25.4012&amp;nbsp;kg
* 1 bushel (wheat)  = 60&amp;nbsp;lb = 27.2155&amp;nbsp;kg
* 1 bushel (barley) = 48&amp;nbsp;lb = 21.7724&amp;nbsp;kg

In trade terms a bushel is a term used to refer to these nominal weights, although even this varies. With oats, Canada uses 34&amp;nbsp;lb bushels and the US uses 32&amp;nbsp;lb bushels.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The most common practical cooking measures for both liquid and dry ingredients in the U.S. are the teaspoon, tablespoon, and cup, along with halves, thirds, quarters, and eighths of these.  Pounds, ounces, fluid ounces, and common sizes are also used, such as can (presumed size varies depending on product), jar, square (e.g., 1 oz of chocolate), stick (e.g., 4 oz butter), or fruit/vegetable (e.g., a half lemon, two medium onions).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Units of temperature==
Degrees [[Fahrenheit]] are used in the U.S. to measure [[temperature]]s in most non-scientific contexts. The [[Rankine scale]] of [[absolute temperature]] also saw some use in [[thermodynamics]]. Scientists worldwide use the [[kelvin]] and [[degree Celsius]]. Several U.S. technical standards are expressed in Fahrenheit temperatures and American medical practitioners often use degrees Fahrenheit for body temperature.

The relationship between the different temperature scales is [[linear function|linear]] but the scales have different zero points, so conversion is not simply multiplication by a factor. Pure water freezes at 32&amp;nbsp;°F = 0&amp;nbsp;°C and boils at 212&amp;nbsp;°F = 100&amp;nbsp;°C at 1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]].  The conversion formula is:

&lt;math&gt;[^\circ \text{F}] = \frac{9}{5} [^\circ \text{C}] + 32&lt;/math&gt; or inversely as &lt;math&gt;[^\circ \text{C}] = \frac{5}{9}([^\circ \text{F}] - 32)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Other units==
* 1 [[board-foot]] = 1&amp;nbsp;ft × 1&amp;nbsp;ft × 1&amp;nbsp;in = {{val|2.360|ul=dm3}}
* 1 [[British thermal unit]] (Btu) ≈ 1055&amp;nbsp;J
* 1 [[ton of refrigeration]] (12,000 Btu/h) = 3.517&amp;nbsp;kW
* 1 [[calorie]] (cal) = 4.184&amp;nbsp;J
* 1 food calorie ([[kilocalorie]], large calorie) (kcal, Cal) = 4.184&amp;nbsp;kJ
* 1 [[foot-pound (energy)]] ≈ 1.356&amp;nbsp;J
* 1 [[hand (unit)|hand]] = 4&amp;nbsp;in = 10.16&amp;nbsp;cm
* 1 [[horsepower]] ≈ 745.7&amp;nbsp;W
* 1 [[R-value (insulation)|''R''-value]] (ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;sdot;°F&amp;sdot;h/Btu) ≈ 0.1761&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;SI&lt;/sub&gt; (K&amp;sdot;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/W)
* 1 [[slug (unit)|slug]] = 1&amp;nbsp;[[pound-force|lbf]]&amp;sdot;s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/ft
* 1 U ([[rack unit]]) = 1.75&amp;nbsp;in = 44.45&amp;nbsp;mm
* Various combination units are in common use, including the [[foot-pound]] (ft&amp;sdot;lbf), the [[acre-foot]], and the [[pound per square inch]] (psi); these are straightforwardly defined based on the above basic units.

Sizing systems are used for various items in commerce, several of which are U.S.-specific:
* [[US standard clothing size]]
* [[American wire gauge]] is used for most metal wire.
* [[Scoop (utensil)]] sizes, numbered by scoops per quart
* Thickness of [[leather]] is measured in ounces, 1&amp;nbsp;oz equals 1/64&amp;nbsp;inch (0.4&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=Larry J.|title=Makin' Leather: A Manual of Primitive and Modern Leather Skills|date=1981|publisher=Cedar Fort|isbn=0882908359|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bolts and screws follow the [[Unified Thread Standard]] rather than the [[ISO metric screw thread]] standard.
* [[Knitting needles]] in the United States are measured according to a [[Knitting needle#Needle sizes and conversions|non-linear unitless numerical system]].
* [[Aluminium foil]] is measured in ''mils'' (1/1000 of an inch, or 0.0254&amp;nbsp;mm) in the United States.
* Cross-sectional area of electrical wire is measured in [[Circular mil]]s in the U.S. and Canada, one circular mil (cmil) being equal to {{val|5.067|e=−4|u=mm2}} (or {{val|7.854|e=−7|u=in2}}). Since this is so small, actual wire is commonly measured in thousands of a cmil, called either kcmil or MCM.
* The ''mil'' or ''thou'' is also sometimes used to mean [[thousandth of an inch]].
* [[Sheet metal]] in the U.S. is commonly measured in [[Sheet metal#Gauge|gauge]] (not to be confused with the American wire gauge), which is derived from weight and thus differs by material.
* [[Nominal Pipe Size]] is used for the outside diameter of pipes. Below NPS14, the NPS number is not consistent with the pipe diameter in inches.
* [[Copper tubing]], however, is measured in [[Copper tubing#United States|nominal size]], 1/8 inch less than the outside diameter.
* The [[Nominal Pipe Size#NPS tables for selected sizes|Schedule]] system is used for standard pipe thicknesses.
* Alcohol content is frequently given in [[Alcohol proof|proof]].
* The [[Cord (unit)|cord]] is used for volume of firewood.
* The [[Square (unit)|square]] is used to mean 100 square feet in construction.
* [[Heat flux]] in the U.S. is measured in [[Langley (unit)|Langleys]].

==Other names for U.S. customary units==
The United States Code refers to these units as "traditional systems of weights and measures".&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|15|205b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other common ways of referring to the system in the U.S. are: "Customary", "Standard", or, erroneously: "English", or "Imperial" (which refers to the post-1824 reform measures used throughout the British Empire). Another term is the [[foot–pound–second system|foot–pound–second]] (FPS) system, as opposed to [[centimetre–gram–second system of units|centimeter–gram–second]] (CGS) and [[MKS system of units|meter–kilogram–second]] (MKS) systems.

Tools and fasteners with sizes measured in inches are sometimes called "SAE bolts" or "SAE wrenches" to differentiate them from their metric counterparts.  The [[SAE International|Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE) originally developed fasteners standards using U.S. units for the U.S. auto industry; the organization now uses metric units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sae.org/exdomains/standardsdev/global_resources/SAE%20Metric%20Users%20Guide.pdf |title= Rules for SAE Use of SI (Metric) Units |date= May 1999 |publisher= Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc |accessdate= July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[astronomy]], [[geography]], and related sciences and contexts, a ''[[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]]'' or ''[[plane (geometry)|plane]]'' passing by a given point is said to be '''vertical''' if it contains the local [[gravity direction]] at that point.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last1 = Hofmann-Wellenhof |first1 = B.
|last2 = Moritz |first2 = H.
|title = Physical Geodesy

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversely, a direction or plane is said to be '''horizontal''' if it is perpendicular to the vertical direction.

The usage of the inter-related terms '''horizontal''' and '''vertical''' as well as their symmetries and asymmetries vary with context (e.g. two vs. three dimensions).
In general, something that is vertical can be drawn from up to down (or down to up), such as the y-axis in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].

==Historical definition==
[[Girard Desargues]] defined the vertical to be [[horizon#Projective geometry|perpendicular to the horizon]] in his ''Perspective'' of 1636.

The word "horizontal" is derived from "[[horizon]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|horizontal}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas "vertical" originates in the late [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|verticalis}}'', which is from the same root as ''[[Vertex (disambiguation)|vertex]]'' 'highest point'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|vertical}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geophysical definition==
{{further|Gravity of Earth|Figure of Earth}}

===The plumb line and spirit level===
[[File:Bubble on a marble shelf.PNG|thumb|Spirit level bubble on a marble shelf tests for horizontality]]
In physics, in engineering, and in construction, the direction designated as vertical is usually that along which a [[plumb-bob]] hangs. Alternatively, a [[spirit level]] that exploits the buoyancy of an air bubble and its tendency to go vertically upwards may be used to test for horizontality. Modern rotary laser levels that can level themselves automatically are robust sophisticated instruments and work on the same fundamental principle.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.laser-level.co.uk/products/stabila-rotary-lasers/stabila-lar200.html Laser Levels]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For how a spirit level works, see http://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=562730&lt;/ref&gt;

===The flat earth approximation===
In the flat earth scenario,&lt;ref&gt;See ''Theory and Problems of Theoretical Mechanics" by Murray R Spiegel, 1987, pg 62&lt;/ref&gt; where the earth is notionally a large (infinite) flat surface with gravitational field at a right angle to the surface, the earth surface is horizontal and any plane parallel to the earth surface is also horizontal.  Vertical planes, e.g., walls, may be parallel to each other or they may intersect at a vertical line. Horizontal surfaces do not intersect. Furthermore, a  plane cannot both be a horizontal plane at one place and a vertical plane somewhere else.

===The spherical Earth===
[[File:Vertical wall are never parallel.PNG|thumb|Strictly, vertical walls are never parallel on the surface of a spherical planet]]
When the curvature of the earth is taken into account, the concepts of vertical and horizontal take on yet another meaning. On the surface of a smoothly spherical, homogenous, non-rotating planet, the plumb bob picks out as vertical the radial direction. Strictly speaking, it is now no longer possible for vertical walls to be parallel: ''all'' verticals intersect. This fact has real practical applications in construction and civil engineering, e.g., the tops of the towers of a suspension bridge are further apart than at the bottom. 
&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia.com. In very long bridges, it may be necessary to take the earth's curvature into account when designing the towers. For example, in the New York's Verrazano Narrows Bridge, the towers, which are 700 ft (215 m) tall and stand 4260 ft (298 m) apart, are about 1.75 in (4.5 cm) farther apart at the top than they are at the bottom.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Horizontal planes can intersect.PNG|thumbnail|On a spherical planet, horizontal planes intersect. In the example shown, the blue line represents the tangent plane at the North pole, the red the tangent plane at an equatorial point. The two intersect at a right angle.]]
Also, horizontal planes can intersect when they are [[tangent]] planes to separated points on the surface of the earth. In particular, a plane tangent to a point on the equator intersects the plane tangent to the [[North Pole]] at a [[right angle]]. (See diagram).
Furthermore, the [[equator]]ial plane is parallel to the tangent plane at the North Pole and as such has claim to be a horizontal plane. But it is. at the same time, a vertical plane for points on the equator. In this sense, a plane can, arguably, be ''both'' horizontal and vertical, horizontal ''at one place'', and vertical ''at another''.

=== Further complications===
{{Main Article|Vertical deflection}}
For a spinning earth, the plumb line deviates from the radial direction as a function of latitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://faculty.trinityvalleyschool.org/hoseltom/handouts/Chap%2014-Ax-Plumb-bob%20Deviation%20w%20Latitude-34PbyE.pdf|title= Working in the Rotating Reference Frame of the Earth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only at the North and South Poles does the plumb line align with the local radius. The situation is actually even more complicated because earth is not a [[homogeneous]] smooth sphere. It is a non homogeneous, non spherical, knobby planet in motion, and the vertical not only need not lie along a radial, it may even be curved and be varying with time. On a smaller scale, a mountain to one side may deflect the plumb bob away from the true [[zenith]].&lt;ref&gt;Such a deflection was measured by [[Nevil Maskelyne]]. See Maskelyne, N. (1775). "An Account of Observations Made on the Mountain Schiehallion for Finding Its Attraction". Phil. Trans. Royal Soc. 65 (0): 500–542. doi:10.1098/rstl.1775.0050. [[Charles Hutton]] used the observed value to determine the density of the earth.&lt;/ref&gt;

On a larger scale the gravitational field of the earth, which is at least approximately radial near the earth, is not radial when it is affected by the moon at higher altitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Walls and floors ===
[[File:Brick wall close-up view.jpg|thumb|Brick wall showing horizontal mortar courses and vertical perpendiculars. By contrast, a level floor only contains horizontal lines.]] 
On a (horizontal) floor, one can draw a horizontal line but not a vertical line in the sense of a plumb bob line. But on a (vertical) wall, one can draw both vertical ''and'' horizontal lines. In this sense, a vertical wall allows more options. This is reflected in the tools a bricklayer uses: a plumb line for verticality and a spirit level to check that the mortar courses are horizontal.
On the other hand, in contrast to a wall a horizontal floor allows more options when one considers compass directions. One can draw on a floor lines going north, south, east, and west, in fact, along any compass direction. A wall allows fewer options. For instance, on a wall which runs along a longitude, an insect cannot crawl east.

=== Independence of horizontal and vertical motions ===
Neglecting the curvature of the earth, horizontal and vertical motions of a projectile moving under gravity are independent of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Salters Hornerns Advanced Physics Project, As Student Book, Edexcel Pearson, London,  2008, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical displacement of a projectile is not affected by the horizontal component of the launch velocity, and, conversely, the horizontal displacement is unaffected by the vertical component.  The notion dates at least as far back as Galileo.&lt;ref&gt;See Galileo's discussion of how bodies rise and fall under gravity on a moving ship in his ''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems''(trans. S. Drake). University of California Press, Berkeley, 1967, pp. 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the curvature of the earth is taken into account, the independence of the two motion does ''not'' hold. For example, even a projectile fired in a horizontal direction (i.e., with a zero vertical component) may leave the surface of the spherical earth and indeed escape altogether.&lt;ref&gt;See Harris Benson ''University Physics'', New York 1991, page 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical definition==

===In two dimensions===
[[File:Vertical horizontal.PNG|thumb|In two dimensions. 1. The vertical direction is designated. 2. The horizontal is normal to the vertical. Through any point P, there is exactly one vertical and exactly one horizontal. Alternatively, one can start by designating the horizontal direction.]]

In the context of a two-dimensional orthogonal [[Cartesian coordinate system]] on  a Euclidean plane, to say that a line is horizontal or vertical, an initial designation has to be made. One can start off by designating the vertical direction, usually labelled  the Y direction.&lt;ref&gt;For an example of identification of the ''y''-axis with the vertical, and the ''x''-axis with the horizontal, see G.S.Rehill's ''Interactive Maths Series, "Building a Strong foundation in Mathematics"'', accessible on http://www.mathsteacher.com.au/year8/ch15_graphs/05_hor/ver.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; The horizontal direction, usually labelled the X direction,&lt;ref&gt;For a definition of "Horizontal axis" see Math Dictionary at http://www.icoachmath.com/math_dictionary/Horizontal_Axis.html&lt;/ref&gt; is then automatically determined. Or, one can do it the other way around, i.e., nominate the ''x''-axis, in which case the ''y''-axis is then automatically determined. There is no special reason to choose the horizontal over the vertical as the initial designation: the two directions are on par in this respect.

The following hold in the two-dimensional case:
# Through any point P in the plane, there is one and only one ''vertical line'' within the plane and one and only one ''horizontal line'' within the plane. This symmetry breaks down as one moves to the three-dimensional case.
# A  ''vertical line'' is any line parallel to the vertical direction. A ''horizontal line'' is any line normal to a vertical line.
# Horizontal lines do not cross each other.
#Vertical lines do not cross each other.

Not all of these elementary geometric facts are true in the 3-D context.

===In three dimensions===
In the three-dimensional case, the situation is more complicated as now one has horizontal and vertical planes in addition to horizontal and vertical lines. Consider a point P and designate a direction through P as vertical. A plane which contains P and is normal to the designated direction is the ''[[horizontal plane]]'' at P. Any plane going through P, normal to the horizontal plane is a  ''[[vertical plane]]'' at P. Through any point P, there is one and only one horizontal plane but a ''multiplicity'' of vertical planes. This is a new feature that emerges in three dimensions. The symmetry that exists in the two-dimensional case no longer holds.

=== In the classroom===
[[File:Mystery of the horizontal y-axis.PNG|thumb|The ''y''-axis on the wall is vertical but the one on the table is horizontal]]
In the 2-dimension case, as mentioned already, the usual designation of the vertical coincides with the [[y-axis]] in co-ordinate geometry. This convention can cause confusion in the classroom. For the teacher, writing perhaps on a white board, the ''y''-axis really is  vertical in the sense of the plumbline verticality but for the student the axis may well lie on a horizontal table.

Although the word horizontal is commonly used in daily life and language (see below), it is subject to many misconceptions.

* The concept of horizontality only makes sense in the context of a clearly measurable gravity field, i.e., in the 'neighborhood' of a planet, star, etc. When the gravity field becomes very weak (the masses are too small or too distant from the point of interest), the notion of being horizontal loses its meaning.
[[File:Verticals at separate points.PNG|thumb|Verticals at two separate points are not parallel. The same holds for their associated horizontal planes]]
* A plane is horizontal only at the chosen point. Horizontal planes at two separate points are not parallel, they intersect.
* In general, a horizontal plane will only be perpendicular to a [[vertical direction]] if both are specifically defined with respect to the same point: a direction is only vertical at the point of reference. Thus both horizontality and verticality are strictly speaking local concepts, and it is always necessary to state to which location the direction or the plane refers to. Note that (1) the same restriction applies to the straight lines contained within the plane: they are horizontal only at the point of reference, and (2) those straight lines contained in the plane but not passing by the reference point are not necessarily horizontal anywhere.
[[File:Gravitational field due to knobbly planet.PNG|thumb|field lines for a non homogeneous knobbly planet in motion may be curved. The white, red and hlue bits illustrate the planet's heterogeneity.]]
* In reality, the gravity field of a heterogeneous planet such as [[Earth]] is deformed due to the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of materials with different [[density|densities]]. Actual horizontal planes are thus not even parallel even if their reference points are along the same vertical line, since a vertical line is slightly curved.
* At any given location, the total gravitational force is not quite constant over [[time]], because the objects that generate the gravity are moving. For instance, on Earth the horizontal plane at a given point (as determined by a pair of [[spirit level]]s) changes with the position of the Moon (air, sea and land [[tide]]s).
* On a rotating planet such as Earth, the strictly gravitational pull of the planet (and other celestial objects such as the Moon, the [[Sun]], etc.) is different from the apparent net force (e.g., on a free-falling object) that can be measured in the laboratory or in the field. This difference is the [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]] associated with the planet's rotation. This is a [[fictitious force]]: it only arises when calculations or experiments are conducted in [[Inertial frame of reference|non-inertial frames of reference]], such as the surface of the Earth.

In general, something that is horizontal can be drawn from left to right (or right to left), such as the x-axis in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===Practical use in daily life===

The concept of a horizontal plane is thus anything but simple, although, in practice, most of these effects and variations are rather small: they are measurable and can be predicted with great accuracy, but they may not greatly affect our daily life.

This dichotomy between the apparent simplicity of a concept and an actual complexity of defining (and measuring) it in scientific terms arises from the fact that the typical linear scales and dimensions of relevance in daily life are 3 [[orders of magnitude]] (or more) smaller than the size of the Earth. Hence, the world appears to be flat locally, and horizontal planes in nearby locations appear to be parallel. Such statements are nevertheless approximations; whether they are acceptable in any particular context or application depends on the applicable requirements, in particular in terms of accuracy.
[[File:Mystery of the horizontal y-axis.PNG|thumb|The y-axis on the wall is vertical but the one on the table is horizontal.]]
In graphical contexts, such as [[Technical drawing|drawing and drafting]] and Co-ordinate geometry on rectangular paper, it is very common to associate one of the dimensions of the paper with a horizontal, even though the entire sheet of paper is standing on a flat horizontal (or slanted) table. In this case, the horizontal direction is typically from the left side of the paper to the right side. This is purely conventional (although it is somehow 'natural' when drawing a natural scene as it is seen in reality), and may lead to misunderstandings or misconceptions, especially in an educational context.
