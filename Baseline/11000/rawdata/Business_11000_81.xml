'''Academic program prioritization''' is the activity or process in which an [[academic institution]] assesses and prioritizes its programs for the purpose of more strategically allocating its funding and resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.d.umn.edu/vcaa/program_prioritization.html Program prioritization homepage at the University of Minnesota Duluth]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a process a school engages in when it intends to make systematic changes. For instance, [[Boise State University]] underwent a yearlong process of exploring and assessing its programs with the intention of making the university more focused and more aligned with the needs of its students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://president.boisestate.edu/prioritization/ Program prioritization homepage at Boise State University]&lt;/ref&gt;

Program prioritization is similar to [[program evaluation]] but differs in that it not only involves evaluating programs but also involves making financial decisions concerning program funding. Program prioritization can be a significant issue, having the potential to affect the lives and goals of both students and faculty.  This page deals with program prioritization in the context of [[higher education]], and it attempts to provide a basic description of what this entails.

==General description==

A school engaged in the process of prioritizing its programs may decide to either increase, decrease, continue, or discontinue the funding for particular programs, leading to these programs being either expanded, downsized, unchanged, or discontinued entirely. For example, in 2013, [[Western Carolina University]] announced that after a process of program prioritization it would discontinue several programs including a bachelor’s in [[Germans studies|German]], a minor in [[women’s studies]], as well master’s programs in [[music]], [[health sciences]], [[English studies|English]], and [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;"Belcher announces program cuts, 3 programs saved", News page, Western Carolinian University [http://www.westerncarolinian.com/news/belcher-announces-program-cuts-3-programs-saved-1.3048901#.Uw49fPldUuc]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Programs are generally prioritized on the basis of their student populations and potential to attract new students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indstate.edu/academicaffairs/program_prioritization.htm Program prioritization homepage, Indiana State University]&lt;/ref&gt; Though, other factors may also weigh in on the likelihood of a program being downsized or discontinued, such as its overall cost for the university.

==Causes==

Prioritization of programs and reallocation of funding are usually necessitated by the combination of two factors: 1) A school’s desire to develop and expand, and 2) limited funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/11/11/priorities "The Pressure to Prioritize", Inside Higher Ed]&lt;/ref&gt; If a school wants to grow and expand its programs, but doesn’t possess the resources to develop each program equally, prioritization may become necessary. Schools are under pressure to expand and therefore they are going to be under pressure to reallocate funding towards more successful programs.&lt;ref&gt;Dickeson, Robert C., 2010,"Prioritizing Academic Programs and Services: Reallocating Resources to Achieve Strategic Balance" [https://www.amazon.com/Prioritizing-Academic-Programs-Services-Reallocating/dp/0470559683]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''aisle411 Inc.''' is a [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] based company that has developed a [[consumer]] service called '''aisle411''', which allows customers to use their phones to find products in stores. Founded in 2008 by [[Nathan Pettyjohn]] (Founder) and [[Matthew Kulig]] (Co-Founder), aisle411 entered the market in August 2009 with a mobile service that allowed consumers to search retail stores for product locations inside stores using their [[mobile phone]]s.

==History==
In August 2009, aisle411 launched its original product location service in St. Louis, MO area Ace Hardware [[Ace Hardware]] locations and Springfield, MO area Price Cutter grocery stores. In 2010, aisle411 launched its mobile smartphone service with Shop 'n Save, a grocery chain owned by Supervalu [[SuperValu (United States)|Supervalu]] and Schnucks [[Schnucks]] grocery stores in the St. Louis, MO area. In September 2011, WinCo Foods [[WinCo Foods]] partnered with aisle411 to deploy its technology chainwide to its 79 stores. In December 2011, Hyvee [[Hy-Vee]], a grocery chain of 235 store locations launched the aisle411 platform within their mobile iPhone and Android applications allowing shoppers to map products, lists, and weekly ads.  In September 2012, Walgreens [[Walgreens|Walgreens Co.]] launched the aisle411 platform in its iPhone and Android mobile applications, making Walgreens in-store inventory searchable and mappable in over 7,800 locations.

In September 2012, aisle411 acquired the technology assets of [https://web.archive.org/web/20130510114750/http://www.wilocate.net/ WiLocate], adding indoor mobile device positioning technology to its service offering.&lt;ref&gt;http://supermarketnews.com/latest-news/shop-n-save-supports-updated-navigation-app&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.progressivegrocer.com/top-stories/headlines/technology/id33712/winco-foods-deploys-mobile-in-store-navigation-service/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425234316/http://www.progressivegrocer.com/top-stories/headlines/technology/id33712/winco-foods-deploys-mobile-in-store-navigation-service |archive-date=2012-04-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://go.bloomberg.com/tech-blog/2012-07-16-looking-for-pain-relief-app-tells-you-which-aisle-in-walgreens/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/blog/BizNext/2012/09/with-acquisition-aisle411-wants-to.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, aisle411 raised $6.3 million in its first round of financing - led by St. Louis-based Cultivation Capital - to help the company scale, meet demand and expand retail partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;https://venturebeat.com/2013/09/04/aisle411-raises-6-3m-to-create-digital-maps-of-physical-stores/&lt;/ref&gt; Another company that has invested in aisle411 includes [[Billiken Angels Network]].

==Services==
'''aisle411''' allows consumers with [[Smart Phone]]s to pull up a map pinpointing the aisle and location of the object of their desire in a particular store. The aisle411 platform is made available for licensing to retailers, and 3rd parties through an API and Map SDK. Shoppers can also use the app to scan [[barcode]]s to read product reviews and find out about in-store [[Discounts and allowances|discounts]] and promotions. aisle411 went live in the [[iTunes Store]] around Thanksgiving.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/article_c791a6dd-f5e1-5311-bf44-535adf51184f.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Burns was born in [[Monkton, Ayrshire|Monkton]], [[South Ayrshire]], [[Scotland]]. He was the only son and eldest child of [[Thomas Burns (minister)|Thomas Burns]] and Clementina Grant and the great-nephew of the poet [[Robert Burns]]. He came to Otago with his father in the ''[[Philip Laing]]'' arriving in [[Port Chalmers]] on 15 April 1848.&lt;ref name="NZETC Burns"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cyclopedia of New Zealand : Otago &amp; Southland Provincial Districts |year=1905 |url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Cyc04Cycl-t1-body1-d2-d6-d2.html#name-427765-mention |author=Cyclopedia Company Limited |accessdate= 8 July 2010 |location=Christchurch |chapter=Ex-Members}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He played a prominent part in provincial affairs and was a member of the Provincial Council from 1855 to 1859 and again from 1863 to 1870. On three occasions, he served on the Executive Council of the [[Otago Province]].{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=217}} He was also a member of the New Zealand House of Representatives on three occasions; [[Bruce (New Zealand electorate)|Bruce]] 1865–1866, [[Caversham (New Zealand electorate)|Caversham]] 1866–1870 when he resigned, and [[Roslyn (New Zealand electorate)|Roslyn]] 1875–1878 when he resigned.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=187}} He vigorously opposed the abolition of the [[Provinces of New Zealand|provinces]] in 1876.

On 6 April 1861 he married Sarah Scott Dickson, with whom he had 11 children.

He founded the Mosgiel Woollen Company in 1871 in an area on the western outskirts of Dunedin. Burns named the town Mosgiel after his great-uncle Robert Burns's Mossgiel farm in [[Ayrshire]], [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rampantscotland.com/placenames/placename_dunedin.htm Scottish Place Names - Dunedin, New Zealand]&lt;/ref&gt; He imported skilled labour and specialised equipment from [[Great Britain]] to begin large scale [[clothmaking]] in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buykiwimade.govt.nz/wehavegotitmade/Timeline.aspx Manufacturing in New Zealand Timeline] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324134458/http://www.buykiwimade.govt.nz/wehavegotitmade/Timeline.aspx |date=24 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This mill formed the backbone of the Mosgiel economy for decades.

Burns died on 15 September 1901 and is memorialised in the names of two schools - Arthur Burns School in Mosgiel and the Arthur Burns Early Learning Centre. Arthur Burns School in Mosgiel has since been amalgamated with two other primary schools in the region.

'''Abraham "Bram" van Leeuwen''', also known as '''Prince of Lignac''' ([[Rotterdam]], 18 July 1918 - [[Málaga]], 27 May 2001) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] businessman and high-profile millionaire.

==Poor start==
Van Leeuwen grew up in Rotterdam under impoverished circumstances. The humiliation that he and only just one other kid had to borrow his schoolbooks made a big impression on him. This memory was one of the reasons Van Leeuwen promised himself to become rich and successful in life. He founded '''NTI: Nederlands Talen Instituut''', one of the first language training companies. Just before and during [[World War II]] Van Leeuwen wrote an English training course - which was in great demand at that time. To receive permission from the [[Germany|German]] occupiers to start his company he was forced to develop a German course as well.

Van Leeuwen sold his companies at the best time. The '''NTI''' and '''Lecturama''' were sold to the Dutch [[Vendex]] concern in the 1970s for 450 million [[Dutch Guilder|Dutch guilders]] and made him his huge fortune.&lt;ref name="tele"&gt;[[De Telegraaf]] website about the death of the [http://krant.telegraaf.nl/krant/archief/20010531/teksten/bin.leeuwen.bram.vermogen.html Prince of Lignac], visited 16 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jetset==
Van Leeuwen was seen as an eccentric member of the jet set, living on board of his mega-yacht '''New Horizon L''' built by [[Feadship]]/[[Royal van Lent shipyard]]. He received many guests on board of this 60 meter long ship, where even the air-outlets are said to be solid gold.
Rumors say Van Leeuwen bought the title '''Prince de Lignac''' but he always denied this and claimed he received it from a [[prince]] he met during the war. According again to Van Leeuwen his title was acknowledged by the São Paulo Aristocracy Court in 1966&lt;ref name="tele"/&gt;

==Lifestyle==
Van Leeuwen was openly [[homosexual]], which was extremely controversial in the years immediately following World War Two. This openness drew substantial attention from [[gossip]] magazines, as did his penchant for hosting extremely lavish parties, and the fact that the servants on his yacht were exclusively Asian males; when asked why he hired only Asian males for these positions, van Leeuwen said only that they "serve the best"&lt;ref&gt;Internetarchive.org version of 2008 of Inmemoriam.be website about{{cite web|url=http://www.inmemoriam.be/bvdetail.asp?bvid=241 |title=Bram van Leeuwen |accessdate=2008-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701004133/http://www.inmemoriam.be/bvdetail.asp?bvid=241 |archivedate=2008-07-01 |df= }} , link updated 10-10-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Van Leeuwen died on his yacht at the age of 82 years. In his will Van Leeuwen left a small part of his fortune to his longtime partner Hans Verver (Euro 35 million + the yacht).

{{Refimprove|date=February 2011}}

'''Build to order''' ('''BTO''') and sometimes referred to as '''make to order''' or '''made to order''' ('''MTO'''), is a [[Mass production|production]] approach where products are not built until a confirmed order for products is received. BTO is the oldest style of [[order fulfillment]] and is the most appropriate approach used for ''highly customized'' or ''low volume'' products. 

"Made to order" products are common in the food service industry, such as at restaurants.

==Overview==
This approach is considered good for [[Mass customization|highly configured]] products, e.g. [[automobile]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Holweg and Pil, 2004, pg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parry and Graves, 2008, pg.&lt;/ref&gt; [[bicycles]], [[Server (computing)|computer servers]], or for products where holding inventories is very expensive, e.g. [[aircraft]].

In an automotive context, BTO is a demand driven production approach where a product is scheduled and built in response to a confirmed order received for it from a final customer.&lt;ref name=Roehrich&gt;Roehrich, J.K.; Parry, G. and Graves, A. (2011), [http://www.inderscience.com/search/index.php?action=record&amp;rec_id=40869. Implementing build-to-order strategies: enablers and barriers in the European automotive industry], ''International Journal of Automotive Technology and Management''. 11(3): 221-235&lt;/ref&gt; The final customer refers to a known individual owner and excludes all orders by the [[original equipment manufacturer]] (OEM), national sales companies (NSC), dealers or point of sales, bulk orders or other intermediaries in the [[supply chain]]. BTO excludes the order amendment function, whereby forecast orders in the pipeline are amended to customer requirements, as this is seen as another level of sophistication for a [[build to stock]] (BTS) system (also known as build to forecast (BTF)).

BTS is the dominant approach used today across many industries and refers to products that are built before a final purchaser has been identified, with production volume driven by historical demand information.&lt;ref&gt;Parry and Graves, 2008, pg.&lt;/ref&gt; This high stock level, endemic across the auto industry allows some dealers to find an exact or very close match to the customer’s desired vehicle within the dealer networks and supplier parks. The vehicle can then be delivered as soon as transport can be arranged. This has been used to justify stock levels. Whilst providing a rapid response to customer demand, the approach is expensive, mainly in terms of stock, but also transportation as finished goods are rarely where they are required. Holding stock of such a high cash value as finished goods is a key driver of the current crisis in the automotive industry - a crisis that could be eased by implementation of a BTO system.&lt;ref name=Roehrich /&gt;

A BTO system does not mean that all suppliers in the supplier chain should be producing only when a customer order has been confirmed. Clearly, it would not make economic sense for a manufacturer of low value high volume parts to employ BTO. It is appropriate that these should be identified and built to a supplier order, effectively BTS. Part of the challenge in a BTO supplier network is in the identification of which suppliers should be BTO and which BTS. The point in the supply chain when this change occurs is called the ‘decoupling point’. Currently, the majority of automotive supply chains lack a decoupling point and the dominant BTS approach has resulted in billions of dollars of capital being tied up in stock in the supply chain.&lt;ref&gt;Parry and Graves, 2008, pg.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some firms build all their products to order while others practice (BTS). Given the widespread proliferation of products, there are a number of [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]] taking a combined approach, where some items are BTS and others are BTO, which is commonly referred to as "hybrid BTO".&lt;ref&gt;Holweg and Pil, 2001, pg.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main advantages of the BTO approach in environments of high product variety is the ability to supply the customer with the exact product specification required, the reduction in sales discounts and finished good inventory, as well a reduction in stock obsolescence risk. The main disadvantage of BTO is manufacturers are susceptible to market demand fluctuations leading to a reduced capacity utilization in manufacturing. Hence, to ensure an effective use of production resources, a BTO approach should be coupled with proactive demand management. Finding the correct and appropriate balance of BTO and BTS to maintain stock levels appropriate to both the market requirement and operational stability is a current area of academic research.

Related approaches to BTO include the Engineer to Order (ETO) approach, where after an order is received, a part of or the whole design is done, as well as the Assemble to Order (ATO). Together with the BTS approach, these strategies form the spectrum of [[order fulfillment]] strategies a firm can adopt.

The '''Bush family'''  is an American family that is prominent in the fields of politics, sports, entertainment, and business, founded by [[Obadiah Bush]] and Harriet Smith.

Best known for its involvement in politics, the family has held various national and state offices spanning across four generations, including a U.S. Senator, [[Prescott Bush]], a Governor, [[Jeb Bush]], and two U.S. Presidents—one having also served as Vice President, [[George H. W. Bush]], while the other was also a Governor, [[George W. Bush]]. Other family members include a [[National Football League]] (NFL) executive, [[Joe Ellis]], and two nationally known TV personalities, [[Billy Bush]] and [[Jenna Bush Hager]].

[[Peter Schweizer]], author of a biography of the family, has described the Bushes as "the most successful political [[dynasty]] in American history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://washtimes.com/national/20050119-123016-5212r.htm

The Bush family traces its European origin to the 17th century, with Samuel Bush being their first American-born ancestor, in 1647.

[[File:George H.W. and George W. Bush in Beijing 2008.jpg|thumb|[[George W. Bush]] and [[George H. W. Bush]] in Beijing, 2008]]

[[George Herbert Walker|George Herbert "Bert" Walker]] (1875–1953) was a wealthy American banker and businessman. His daughter Dorothy married [[Prescott Bush]], making him the grandfather of the 41st President [[George H. W. Bush]] and the great-grandfather of the 43rd President [[George W. Bush]]. He is also the namesake of the [[Walker Cup]], a men's amateur golf trophy contested in odd-numbered years between a U.S. team and a combined [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] side.

Flora Sheldon, wife of [[Samuel P. Bush]], was a distant descendant of the [[Livingston family|Livingston]], [[Schuyler family|Schuyler]], and [[Wilhelmus Beekman|Beekman]] families, prominent [[New Netherland]] merchant and political patrician families.

[[File:Business hours, Baja Fresh, Germantown, Maryland, August 25, 2016.jpg|thumb]]
'''Business hours''' are the hours during the day in which [[business]] is commonly conducted. Typical business hours vary widely by country.  By observing common informal standards for business hours, workers may communicate with each other more easily and find a convenient divide between work life and home life.

In the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]], the hours between 9 [[12-hour clock|am]] and 5 [[12-hour clock|pm]] (the traditional "[[9 to 5]]") are typically considered to be standard business hours, although in the United States this varies by region due to local tradition and the need to conduct business by telephone with people in other [[time zone]]s.  For instance, business in [[Chicago]] is often conducted between 8 am and 4:30 pm, while in [[New York City]], business hours tend to be later—for instance, from 10 am to 6 pm. On Saturdays, businesses are usually open from 8 or 9 am to noon or 1 pm.

In Mexico, the standard business hours are from 7 [[12-hour clock|am]] to 2 [[12-hour clock|pm]] and 4 [[12-hour clock|pm]] to 6 [[12-hour clock|pm]].

In Finland, government agencies and other institutions follow the hours 8:00am to 4:15pm. Banks are usually open to 4:30pm. Common business is done from Monday to Friday, but major shops are usually open on Saturdays 9:00am – 6:00pm and on Sundays 12:00pm – 9:00pm, with exceptions.

Other countries have different business hour patterns.  Many workers in warmer climates observe [[Siesta]] during the afternoon, between the hours of 2 pm and 5 pm, effecting a pause in business hours, and resuming business in the evenings. La Siesta is a [[Spanish language]] term, which literally translates as a short nap of 15–30 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Siesta|url=http://www.donquijote.org/culture/spain/society/customs/siesta|website=DonQuijote.Org|accessdate=17 November 2014|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business hours usually occur on [[weekday]]s. However, the days of the week on which business is conducted also varies from region to region in the world.

==Non-traditional business hours==
Many businesses and organizations have extended or unlimited business hours if their business takes place continuously. For example, [[hotel]]s, [[airport]]s, and [[hospital]]s are open 24 hours a day, and transactions can take place at any point in time, thus requiring staffing and management availability at all times.
Recent communications technology such as [[smartphone]]s has also extended the working day.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/mobile-phones/9646349/Smartphones-and-tablets-add-two-hours-to-the-working-day.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restrictions==
In some jurisdictions, legislation or regulations may require businesses to limit their trading hours. For example, some Western countries prohibit certain businesses from trading on Sundays, this being traditionally considered a day of rest. Businesses which serve hot food or alcoholic drinks are also frequently restricted in their trading hours.

==United States==
In the [[United States]], the U.S. Department of Labor has mandated that companies must pay overtime to individuals who work over 40 hours a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wage and Hour Division (WHD)|url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs22.htm|website=U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=17 November 2014|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Businesses often do not schedule their employees to work more than 40 hours per week because they want to avoid paying their employees overtime.

==Greece==
In [[Greece]], business hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays are usually from 9 am to 3 pm, while on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays are usually from 9 am to 2 pm and after the siesta from 5.30 pm to 9 pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cityofathens.gr/episkeptes/praktikes-plirofories/ores-leitoyrgias/katastimata|website=Municipality of Athens|accessdate=8 November 2016|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large stores and supermarkets follow an extended business hours schedule and are open Monday to Friday from 9 am to 9 pm and on Saturdays from 9 am to 8 pm. All stores are normally closed on Sundays, but there are several exceptions throughout the year. Banking and civil services hours are usually Monday to Friday from 8 am to 2 pm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alphabank.com.cy/useful9.shtm|website=Alpha Bank|accessdate=8 November 2016|ref=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; with minor variations but are always closed at weekends. All stores and offices are closed on public holidays.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37107">{{Other uses|The Business School (disambiguation){{!}}The Business School}}
A '''business school''' is a university-level institution that confers degrees in [[business administration]] or [[management]]. According to [[Andreas Kaplan|Kaplan]] business schools are "educational institutions that specialize in teaching courses and programs related to business and/or management".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Andreas Kaplan: A school is "a building that has four walls…with tomorrow inside": Toward the reinvention of the business school | doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.03.010 | journal=Business Horizons}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a school can also be known as '''school of management''', '''school of business administration''', or colloquially '''b-school''' or '''biz school'''. A business school teaches topics such as [[accounting]], [[administration (business)|administration]], [[business strategy|strategy]], [[economics]], [[entrepreneurship]], [[finance]], [[human resource management]], [[management science]], [[management information systems]], [[international business]], [[logistics]], [[marketing]], [[organizational psychology]], [[organizational behavior]], [[public relations]], [[research methods]] and [[real estate]] among others.

==Types==
There are several forms of business schools, including a school of business, business administration, and management.
# Most of the university business schools consist of faculties, colleges, or departments within the university, and predominantly teach business courses (e.g. [[Mannheim Business School]]).
# In [[North America]], a business school is often understood to be a university program that offers a graduate [[Master of Business Administration]] degrees and/or undergraduate bachelor's degrees (e.g. [[Harvard Business School]]).
# In Europe and Asia, some universities teach predominantly business courses (e.g. [[Copenhagen Business School]]).
# Privately owned business school which is not affiliated with any university (e.g. [[WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management]]).

[[Andreas Kaplan|Kaplan]] classifies business schools along four '''C'''orners:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Andreas Kaplan: A school is "a building that has four walls…with tomorrow inside": Toward the reinvention of the business school | doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.03.010 | journal=Business Horizons}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''C'''ulture (Europe - US): Independent of their actual (physical) location, business schools can be classified according to whether they follow the European or the US model. 
# '''C'''ompass (international/global – regional/local): Business schools can be classified along a continuum, with international/ global schools on one end and regional/ local schools on the other.
# '''C'''apital (public – private): Business schools can either be publicly (state) funded or privately funded, for example through endowments or tuition fees. 
# '''C'''ontent (teaching – research): Business school can be classified according to whether a school considers teaching or research to be its primary focus.

==Use of case studies==
Some business schools structure their teaching around the use of case studies (i.e. the [[case method]]). Case studies have been used in Graduate and Undergraduate business education for nearly one hundred years. Business cases are historical descriptions of actual business situations. Typically, information is presented about a business firm's products, markets, competition, financial structure, sales volumes, management, employees and other factors influencing the firm's success. The length of a business case study may range from two or three pages to 30 pages, or more.

Business schools often obtain case studies published by the [[Harvard Business Publishing|Harvard Business School]], [[INSEAD]], [[London Business School]], the [[Kellogg School of Management]] at [[Northwestern University]], the [[Ross School of Business]] at the [[University of Michigan]], the [[Richard Ivey School of Business]] at [[The University of Western Ontario]], the [[Darden School]] at the [[University of Virginia]], [[IESE]], other academic institutions, or case clearing houses (such as The Case Centre). Harvard's most popular case studies include ''[[Lincoln Electric]] Co.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/b01/en/common/item_detail.jhtml?id=376028 |title=Lincoln Electric Co |publisher=Harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Google]], Inc.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/b01/en/common/item_detail.jhtml?id=806105 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711040437/http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/b01/en/common/item_detail.jhtml?id=806105 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-11 |title=Google Inc |publisher=Harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students are expected to scrutinize the case study and prepare to discuss strategies and tactics that the firm should employ in the future. Three different methods have been used in business case teaching:
# Preparing case-specific questions to be answered by the student. This is used with short cases intended for Undergraduate students. The underlying concept is that such students need specific guidance to be able to analyze case studies.
# Problem-solving analysis is the second method initiated by the [[Harvard Business School]] which is by far the most widely used method in MBA and executive development programs. The underlying concept is that with enough practice (hundreds of case analyses) students develop intuitive skills for analyzing and resolving complex business situations. Successful implementation of this method depends heavily on the skills of the discussion leader.
# A generally applicable [[strategic planning]] approach. This third method does not require students to analyze hundreds of cases. A strategic planning model is provided and students are instructed to apply the steps of the model to six – and up to a dozen cases – during a semester. This is sufficient to develop their ability to analyze a complex situation, generate a variety of possible strategies and to select the best ones. In effect, students learn a generally applicable approach to analyze cases studies and real situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mbatoolbox.org/stories/storyReader$19 |title=Chapter 1.2. A Model for Strategic Planning, Analyzing Cases and Decision Making |publisher=Mbatoolbox.org |date=2006-02-22 |accessdate=2012-03-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204141117/http://www.mbatoolbox.org/stories/storyReader$19 |archive-date=2012-02-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach does not make any extraordinary demands on the artistic and dramatic talents of the teacher. Consequently, most professors are capable of supervising the application of this method.

===History of business cases===
When [[Harvard Business School]] started operating in 1908, the faculty realized that there were no textbooks suitable for a graduate program in business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Yumlembam|first1= Dayananda|title= MICA innovation to help Harvard business school sharpen teaching tools|url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/MICA-innovation-to-help-Harvard-business-school-sharpen-teaching-tools/articleshow/9351342.cms
|website= Times of India|publisher= TNN|accessdate= 9 November 2015
|quote = When Harvard Business School was started, its faculty members realized that there were no textbooks suitable to a graduate program in business. That was when they decided to use case studies which are detailed accounts of innovative methods and practices that managers follow. 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Their first solution to this problem involved interviewing leading practitioners of business and writing detailed accounts of what these managers were doing, based partly on the case method already in use at [[Harvard Law School]]. Of course, the professors could not present these [[case (disambiguation)|case]]s as practices to be emulated, because there were no criteria available for determining what would succeed and what would not succeed. So the professors instructed their students to read the cases and to come to class prepared to discuss the cases and to offer recommendations for appropriate courses of action. The basic outlines of this method still operate in business-school curricula {{as of | 2016 | lc = on}}.

==Other approaches==
In contrast to the case method some schools use a skills-based approach in teaching business. This approach emphasizes quantitative methods, in particular [[operations research]], [[management information systems]], [[statistics]], organizational behavior, [[Scientific modelling|modeling]] and [[simulation]], and [[decision science]]. The leading institution in this method is the [[Tepper School of Business]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. The goal is to provide students a set of tools that will prepare them to tackle and solve problems.

Another important approach used in business school is the use of [[business game]]s that are used in different disciplines such as business, economics, management, etc. Some colleges are blending many of these approaches throughout their degree programs, and even blending the method of delivery for each of these approaches. A study from by Inside Higher Ed and the Babson Survey Research Group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kolowich|first1=Steve|title=Online Learning and Liberal Arts Colleges|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/06/29/liberal-arts-college-explore-uses-blended-online-learning|website=Inside Highered|accessdate=9 November 2015|date=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that there is still disagreement as to the effectiveness of the approaches but the reach and accessibility is proving to be more and more appealing. [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States]] like [[New England College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bisk.com/pr/new-england-college-launches-online-degrees|title=Bisk Education|work=bisk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wesleyan University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/06/29/liberal-arts-college-explore-uses-blended-online-learning|title=Liberal arts college explore uses of 'blended' online learning - InsideHigherEd.com|work=insidehighered.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bryn Mawr College]] are now offering complete [[online degrees]] in many business curriculae despite the controversy that surrounds the learning method.

There are also several business schools which still rely on the lecture method to give students a basic business education. Lectures are generally given from the professor's point of view, and rarely require interaction from the students unless notetaking is required. Lecture as a method of teaching in business schools has been criticized by experts for reducing the incentive and individualism in the learning experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113 | title = Natural Learning in Higher Education| author = J. Scott Armstrong | journal = Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Executive education==
In addition to teaching students, many business schools run Executive Education programs. These may be either open programs or company-specific programs. Executives may also acquire an MBA title in an Executive MBA program within university of business or from top ranked business schools. Many business schools seek close co-operation with business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schreuder, Hein|first1=Jeannet, Jean-Pierre|title=From Coal to Biotech The Transformation of DSM with Business School Support |isbn=9783662462997 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/From_Coal_to_Biotech.html?id=0gdJCAAAQBAJ |accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accreditation==

[[File:Ceirano 5 HP.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Ceirano 5 HP (1901)]]
The '''Ceirano GB &amp; C''' was a historic automobile company, founded in October 1898 by [[Giovanni Battista Ceirano]], Emanuele di Bricherasio, Attilio Calligaris, Pietro Fenoglio and Cesare Goria Gatti.
 
The headquarters of the new company was set at Turin, where in 1899 it began to build a small car with two seats, the ''Welleyes'' designed by Aristide Faccioli. Welleyes was a great commercial success for Ceirano, but managers found themselves unable to cope with the orders of the vehicle. Then in July 1898 Ceirano decided to sell the plans and patents to [[Giovanni Agnelli]].

==Ceirano family background==

The Ceirano brothers, [[Giovanni Battista Ceirano|Giovanni Battista]], [[Giovanni Ceirano|Giovanni]], [[Ernesto Ceirano|Ernesto]] and [[Matteo Ceirano|Matteo]], were influential in the founding of the Italian auto industry, being variously responsible for : Ceirano; Welleyes (the technical basis of F.I.A.T.); [[Fratelli Ceirano]]; [[Società Torinese Automobili Rapid|S.T.A.R. / Rapid]] ([[Società Torinese Automobili Rapid]]); [[SCAT (automobile)|SCAT]] (Società Ceirano Automobili Torino); [[Itala]] and [[S.P.A. (automobile)|S.P.A. (Società Piemontese Automobili)]]. Giovanni's son [[Giovanni "Ernesto" Ceirano|Giovanni "Ernesto"]] was also influential, co-founding [[Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili]] (aka [[Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili|Giovanni Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili]]) and [[Aurea (car)|Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (FATA)]].

In 1888, after eight years apprenticeship at his father's watch-making business, Giovanni Battista started building ''Welleyes'' bicycles, so named because English names had more sales appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italiancar.net/site/cars/lancia/index/lancia.html Lancia, the essentials]&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1898 Giovanni Battista and Matteo co-founded Ceirano GB &amp; C and started producing the ''Welleyes'' motor car in 1899. In July 1899 the plant and patents were sold to [[Giovanni Agnelli]] and produced as the first [[F.I.A.T.]]s - the [[Fiat 4 HP]]. Giovanni Battista was employed by Fiat as the agent for Italy, but within a year he left to found [[Fratelli Ceirano|Fratelli Ceirano &amp; C.]] which in 1903 became [[Società Torinese Automobili Rapid]] (S.T.A.R.) building cars badged as 'Rapid'. In 1904 [[Matteo Ceirano]] left Ceirano GB &amp; C to create his own brand - [[Itala]]. In 1906 Matteo left Itala to found [[S.P.A. (automobile)|S.P.A. (Società Piemontese Automobili)]] with chief designer, Alberto Ballacco. In 1906 Giovanni founded [[SCAT (automobile)|SCAT]] (Società Ceirano Automobili Torino) in Turin. In 1919 Giovanni and Giovanni "Ernesto" co-founded [[Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili]] (aka [[Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili|Giovanni Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili]]) and in 1922 they took control of  [[Aurea (car)|Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (FATA)]].

== The car ==
[[File:Ceirano 1901.JPG|thumb|Ceirano 1901]]
The Welleyes was presented on 30 April 1899, and was designed by Aristide Faccioli, one of the most brilliant car engineers at the time. The car was equipped with two horizontal cylinders, transmission with leather belt and with two gears.&lt;ref name="motorspeed.wordpress.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://motorspeed.wordpress.com/category/history-of-cars/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121216153215/http://motorspeed.wordpress.com/category/history-of-cars/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-16 |title=1899 Ceirano Welleyes |accessdate=2008-02-26 |work=motorspeed.wordpress.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Fiat made car [[Fiat 4 HP|FIAT 3 ½ HP]] was a direct derivative of this model.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3878">'''Data warehouse automation''' ('''DWA''') refers to the process of accelerating and automating the [[data warehouse]] development cycles, while assuring quality and consistency. DWA is believed to provide automation of the entire lifecycle of a data warehouse, from source [[Systems analysis|system analysis]] to [[Software testing|testing]] to  [[documentation]]. It helps improve productivity, reduce cost, and improve overall quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Automate and accelerate your data transformations|url=http://www.attunity.com/products/prepare-data-compose|website=www.attunity.com|publisher=Attunity|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General==
Data warehouse automation primarily focuses on automation of each and every step involved in the lifecycle of a data warehouse, thus reducing the efforts required in managing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Buzzword! Data Warehouse Automation|url=http://blogs.jetreports.com/2015/03/05/new-buzzword-data-warehouse-automation/|website=blogs.jetreports.com|publisher=jetreports|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Data warehouse automation works on the principles of design patterns. It comprises a central repository of design patterns, which encapsulate architectural standards as well as best practices for data design, data management, data integration, and data usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wherescape.com/media/1988/data-warehouse-automation-decision-guide.pdf|title=Data Warehouse Automation - A Decision Guide|website=www.wherescape.com|publisher=David L. Wells, Infocentric LLC|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 2015, an analyst firm has published a guide ''Which Data Warehouse Automation Tool is Right for You?'' covering four of the leading products in the DWA space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Which Data Warehouse Automation Tool is Right for You?|url=http://eckerson.com/register?content=which-data-warehouse-automation-tool-is-right-for-you|website=eckerson.com|publisher= Wayne Eckerson|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, an international software and technology services company engaged in developing ‘agile tools’ for the data integration industry, was named by CIO Review as one of the 20 most promising productivity tools solution providers 2015 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CIO Magazine Award - 20 Most promising productivity tools|url=http://analytixds.com/latest_news/analytix-data-services-wins-cio-reviews-2015/|website=www.analtyixds.com|publisher=AnalytiX DS|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Data warehouse automation can provide advantages like source data exploration, warehouse data models, ETL generation, test automation, metadata management, managed deployment, scheduling, change impact analysis and easier maintenance and modification of the data warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Warehouse Automation (DWA)?|url=http://www.timextender.com/software/data-warehouse-automation/business-value/|website=timextender.com|publisher=TimeXtender Software 2015|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
More important than the technical features of DWA tools, however, is the ability to deliver projects faster and with less resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deliver Faster|url=http://kalido.com/products/kalido-information-engine/deliver-faster/|website=kalido.com|publisher=Magnitude Software|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dimitrios Pavlos Giannakopoulos''' (alternate spellings: Dimitris Giannacopoulos) ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Δημήτρης Παύλος Γιαννακόπουλος) is a [[Greece|Greek]] [[businessman]], vice-president of the Board of Directors and Deputy CEO of [[Vianex S.A.|VIANEX]] and major shareholder of [[Greek Basket League]] club [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos Athens]].&lt;ref name=intro&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vianex.gr/etairia/sub-diarthrwsh.|title=Vianex|website=Vianex.gr|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biographical information ==
Dimitris Giannakopoulos is [[Pavlos Giannakopoulos]]’ son and [[Thanasis Giannakopoulos]]’s nephew, owners of [[Vianex S.A.|VIANEX]], the largest Greek pharmaceutical company today. The family’s engagement in the pharmaceutical sector began with his grandfather, Dimitris Giannakopoulos from [[Sellasia]] in [[Laconia]], who in 1924 opened a pharmacy in the centre of Athens.

In 1971, Pavlos Giannakopoulos founded VIANEX. In 2012, despite the Greek financial crisis, the company announced net sales of up to €240,200,000. He is now the heir of the dynasty built by his father and his uncles, including both VIANEX and [[Panathinaikos B.C.]], marking the emergence of the new generation in particularly difficult times. In 2004, he was made first vice-president at VIANEX, while since January 2012, he has also assumed the office of Deputy CEO.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

He is married to Ioanna Marosouli, with whom he has two children.

== Business activity ==
Dimitris Giannakopoulos took on the family business from his father, Pavlos, in January 2012, when he became Deputy CEO, additionally to being vice-president of the Board of Directors of VIANEX.

The company entered the new era under Dimitris Giannakopoulos' management, that was connected with the increase of openness and the conclusion of important deals, either new ones or renewals of old ones. In July 2013, on the occasion of the announcement of the cooperation between VIANEX and [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]], for the production of the inject-able antibiotic Vancomycin on the premises of VIANEX in China, and the export of 100% of the production to the Chinese market, Pavlos Giannakopoulos stated: "I handed over to him the reigns of the largest Greek pharmaceutical company in the country, and I am convinced he will someday turn it into the largest pharmaceutical company even abroad". VIANEX's goals include expansion to other foreign markets as well, such as [[South Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[Japan]], and Arabic countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.report24.gr/giannakopoulos-epektasi-tis-vianex-se-megales-agores.htm|title=Γιαννακόπουλος… “Επέκταση της ΒΙΑΝΕΞ σε Μεγάλες Αγορές” : Νέα και Ειδήσεις Λακωνίας Πελοπόννησος Report24 – η Εφημερίδα σας|website=Report24.gr|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthview.gr/%CF%80%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%B5%CF%87%CF%8C%CE%BC%CE%B5%CE%BD%CE%BF/%CE%AC%CF%81%CE%B8%CF%81%CE%BF/6843/%CE%B4%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%AE%CF%84%CF%81%CE%B7%CF%82-%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BB%CE%BF] {{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VIANEX received an award for its export orientation in the Active Greece Awards 2015. Furthermore, its portfolio comprises other significant awards, such as the [[Diamonds of the Greek Economy]] business award in 2013 and 2015, as well as Salux Index 2014. It is worth mentioning also the award in the Health &amp; Safety Awards 2015, for the best practices in Health and Security in the workplace. The company won the "VIANEX Integrated Health and Safety Quality Program", the ultimate distinction in the "Pharmaceutical Companies" business sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capital.gr/story/2155825|title=Βιανέξ - Λίλλυ: 'Made in Greece' φάρμακα στην Κίνα|website=Capital.gr|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tovima.gr/finance/article/?aid=649983|title=tovima.gr - Τα φάρμακα από την ελληνική ΒΙΑΝΕΞ ταξιδεύουν στην Κίνα|website=Tovima.gr|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onmed.gr/farmako/item/321906-vravefsi-gia-tin-vianeks-sta-salus-index-2014#ixzz3pDekvVJs|title=Βράβευση για την ΒΙΑΝΕΞ στα «Salus Index 2014»|first=Νατάσσα Ν.|last=Σπαγαδώρου|date=13 November 2014|website=Onmed.gr|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Dimitris Giannakopoulos has stated to the press on numerous occasions, VIANEX neither let any employees go, nor did it decrease salaries, despite the financial crisis in Greece. The economic size of VIANEX shrunk; however, its employees "have stood by the company and contributed to achieving high profits over the last years. Thus we, the management, are obligated to support our people, regardless of the economic performance", Dimitris Giannakopoulos stated in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kathimerini.gr/791939/article/oikonomia/epixeirhseis/ta3ideyoyn-sthn-kina-ta-farmaka-ths-viane3|title=Ταξιδεύουν στην Κίνα τα φάρμακα της Βιανέξ - Kathimerini|website=Kathimerini.gr|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ygeia360.gr/el/companies/item/17815-diamonds-of-the-greek-economy-2015-diakrish-gia-thn-bianex-# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-11-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120060558/http://www.ygeia360.gr/el/companies/item/17815-diamonds-of-the-greek-economy-2015-diakrish-gia-thn-bianex-# |archive-date=2015-11-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://kourdistoportocali.com/post/21727/dhm-giannakopoylos-bianeks-gt-to-manifesto-toy-epixeirhmatia-sthn-ekdhlwsh-ths-statbank-diamonds-2013# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-11-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120010947/http://kourdistoportocali.com/post/21727/dhm-giannakopoylos-bianeks-gt-to-manifesto-toy-epixeirhmatia-sthn-ekdhlwsh-ths-statbank-diamonds-2013# |archive-date=2015-11-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social contribution ==
Dimitris Giannakopoulos has engaged in a series of important initiatives with the intention to contribute to Greek society through VIANEX, [[Panathinaikos B.C.]], and the electronic media company DPG Group, which he also owns.

To raise awareness among the population, regarding the issue of cardiovascular disease, VIANEX donated 15,000 bad cholesterol tests within the context of the extended Panhellenic Patient Support Project "Measure LDL with us", under the auspices of the Hellenic Society of Lipidology, Atherosclerosis and Vascular Disease (E.E.L.I.A.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stogiatro.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=35915:vianeks-dwrean-eksetaseis-xolhsterolhs-se-olh-thn-ellada&amp;catid=370:etairika-nea&amp;Itemid=242|title=stogiatro - ΒΙΑΝΕΞ: Δωρεάν εξετάσεις χοληστερόλης σε όλη την Ελλάδα|website=Stogiatro.gr|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, VIANEX donated 300 vaccines to the Social Clinic and Pharmacy of
the diocese of Arkalochori, Kastelli &amp; Viannos, and the Municipality of Minoa Pediadas in Crete, aiming to defend child health, as well as safeguard public health.  DPG offered support to the Mitera - Centre for Child Protection of Attica; its people visited the infant centre and the dormitories of the premises, to give away presents for Christmas, such as candy, clothes, shoes, Sudocream lotions, as well as [[Panathinaikos]] blankets from the PAO Shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsbomb.gr/ellada/news/story/384368/dpg-digital-media--kai-panathinaikos-sto-pleyro-toy-idrymatos-mitera|title=DPG Digital Media  και Παναθηναϊκός στο πλευρό του ιδρύματος «Μητέρα»|first=|last=Newsbomb|date=20 December 2013|website=Newsbomb.gr|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://biologikaorganikaproionta.com/health/145653/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-11-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120014220/http://biologikaorganikaproionta.com/health/145653/# |archive-date=2015-11-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it responded to the invitation of [[Make-A-Wish Foundation|Make-a-Wish foundation]] (Make-a-Wish Greece), by taking part in the charity dinner organized at the [[Benaki Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsbomb.gr/ellada/news/story/600260/mia-eyxi-poy-egine-pragmatikotita|title=Μια ...ευχή που έγινε πραγματικότητα|first=|last=Newsbomb|date=25 June 2015|website=Newsbomb.gr|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panathinaikos B.C. and Dimitris Giannakopoulos donated five cutting-edge wheelchairs to the Patriotic Institution of Social Welfare (PIKPA) of Voula, for the basketball team of the institution during the National Championship of Wheelchair Basketball.

However, in December 2014, he resigned from the club's President position, giving his seat to Manos Papadopoulos. He claimed to have been forced to proceed to such a move because of the constant sanctions and fines imposed on the club by the Greek State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport-fm.gr/article/basket/giannakopoulos/796870|title=Αποχώρησε… τυπικά από την ΚΑΕ ο Γιαννακόπουλος!|website=Sport-fm.gr|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5582">'''EcoPark''' ({{zh|t=環保園}}) located in [[Tuen Mun]] Area 38, on west side of [[Hong Kong]], is similar to an [[industrial park]] exclusively for [[waste recycling]] and [[environmental engineering]].  This is the first of its kind in Hong Kong.

== Introduction ==
In December 2003, the [[Hong Kong Government]] mapped out a strategy on waste management emphasized waste reduction and recovery. Hong Kong currently recycles 48% of its [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW), but over 99% of recovered recyclable materials are exported to [[Mainland China]] for further re-processing while less than 1% are treated locally and re-manufactured into useful products. With the measures to promote waste recovery, recycling and reuse in place, a local waste management area like EcoPark is a viable option for furthering Hong Kong's recycling program.  

EcoPark aims to promote the local [[recycling|recycling industry]] and jump-start a circular economy to provide a sustainable solution to the city's waste problems. By encouraging and promoting the reuse, recovery and recycling of waste resources and returning them to the consumption loop, the EcoPark will help realize the full potential of the local recycling industry and alleviate the heavy reliance on the export of recyclable materials recovered from Hong Kong.

== Design and construction ==
The EcoPark occupies 200,000 square metres of land in Tuen Mun Area 38 and will be developed in two phases. As pledged in the Policy Framework, the aim is to commission Phase I of EcoPark (80,000 square metres) towards the end of 2006 and Phase II (120,000 square metres) in 2009. Hong Kong Government funding will be used to build the basic infrastructure of EcoPark.

The EcoPark will be divided into lots of different sizes. Lots in EcoPark will be tendered for specific recovered materials and processes that help achieve Hong Kong's government waste management objectives, in particular, in recycling local wastes. Admission criteria will be developed with priority given to processes involving value-added technologies, and target materials of the proposed Producer Responsibility Schemes. 

== Progress ==
All six lots in EcoPark Phase I has been allocated for recycling of waste cooking oil, waste computer equipment, waste metals, waste wood, waste plastics and waste car batteries.  Some of them are already in operation, while the rest of tenants will start their operation shortly.

Construction works of the EcoPark Phase II have already completed.  Two lots have been allocated to non-government organisations for recycling of plastics and waste electrical appliances.  The remaining lots in EcoPark Phase II will be available for tendering in late 2010.  

== Phase I tenants ==

[http://www.litong.com/ Li Tong Group] - Recycling of waste computer equipment&lt;br /&gt;
[http://www.shiuwingsteel.com/ Shiu Wing Steel Limited] - Recycling of waste metals&lt;br /&gt;

[http://hktelford.com/ Hong Kong Telford Envirotech Company Limited] - Recycling of waste plastics&lt;br /&gt;
Cosmos Star Company Limited - Recycling of car batteries

== Phase II lots ==
Tendering of Phase II lots (with a total area of 100,000 square metres) will start in late 2010.  Further information on the tendering can be obtained from EcoPark management office.

== Visitor Centre ==
The 1,000-square metre EcoPark Visitor Centre is the first education centre in Hong Kong with a main theme of solid waste management.  Admission is free and docent service will be provided.  Online and telephone booking can be arranged through the EcoPark Management Office. 

== Public consultation ==
Hong Kong Government has consulted the [[Tuen Mun District|Tuen Mun District Council]] and members support the development of EcoPark and agree that EcoPark will help promote development of local recycling industry and create job opportunities in Tuen Mun. The Council hopes that EcoPark will become a landmark for Tuen Mun.

Local trade associations and recyclers were also consulted and they support the development of EcoPark, agreeing that by providing long-term land at affordable cost, together with supporting infrastructure, EcoPark will help enhance recycling technology development and improve waste recovery rates in Hong Kong.

== Environmental considerations ==
An [[Environmental Impact Assessment]] (EIA) was carried out in respect of air and water quality, waste management, land contamination, [[landfill gas]] hazard and hazard to life, in which a wide range of recycling processes for different material types were examined. The assessment recommends a list of materials and processes to be allowed and also recommends a number of mitigation measures. With these measures in place, the EIA concludes that there will be no significant environmental impacts to the surrounding areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4344">A '''ghost restaurant''' (also known as a '''delivery-only restaurant''' or '''online-only restaurant''') is a food service business that serves customers exclusively through [[online food delivery]]. Without the need to interact with customers directly on the premises, ghost restaurants can offset the high cost of a delivery system with cheaper real estate and operations. 

Although restaurants typically earn more from customers who dine at the restaurant, due to the expense of operating a delivery service or the fees charged by third party delivery companies like [[Grubhub]] and Caviar, ghost restaurants have significantly lower overhead. Operating a dining room, with the real estate it requires, staff, amenities, insurance, and other expenses, is a significant cost.&lt;ref name=eater30september2016/&gt; Even restaurants with considerable to-go business traditionally dedicate the majority of their space to seating.&lt;ref name=fastcompany/&gt; As visibility, [[curb appeal]], foot traffic, and accessibility are not concerns, the kitchen can be housed in an inexpensive location that would not typically be considered desirable for a restaurant.

A single company may operate several ghost restaurants, and a single location's kitchen and staff can function as multiple branded restaurants.&lt;ref name=crains/&gt; Without a brick-and-mortar location to renovate, companies can also try out new brands and cuisines with little effort, to appeal to changing tastes and trends.&lt;ref name=crains/&gt;&lt;ref name=fastcompany/&gt;

Most of the restaurants utilize existing delivery services. For example, Green Summit, which owns several ghost restaurants in New York City and partners with Grubhub.&lt;ref name=fastcompany/&gt; Some companies incorporate their own delivery system into the business model, like the New York-based company Maple.&lt;ref name=fastcompany/&gt;&lt;ref name=kessler/&gt; Maple, which is backed by restaurateur [[David Chang]], is able to orient its business around productivity in terms of meals per hour per kitchen &amp;mdash; a metric more typical of [[fast food]] restaurants.&lt;ref name=kessler/&gt;

Several 2015 news articles exposed a sub-segment of operations they termed "ghost restaurants", which operate as unregulated, unlicensed standalone entities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelosangelesbeat.com/2015/07/have-you-missed-starry-kitchens-balls-us-too-uber-eats-is-here-to-save-us/|title=Have You Missed Starry Kitchen’s Balls? Us Too. Uber Eats is Here to Save Us All!|website=The LA Beat|last1=Thompson|first1=Elise Thompson|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as fronts for restaurants that might or might not have health code violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| work=NBC News|location=New York|title= LOCALI-Team: Restaurants Use False Identities on Food Delivery Websites|authors= Glorioso, Chris &amp; Givens, Ann &amp; Stulberger, Evan|date=November 11, 2015|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Seamless-Restaurant-Grubhub-Fake-Eatery-Unregulated-Kitchen-Investigation-I-Team-New-York-City-344708652.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public Controversies==
=== Firing Scandal ===

On July 22, 2013, reportedly after servicing a large group of Glass Lewis employees based in the New York City home office, Brendon O'Connor, an employee of the Milk Truck food truck, tweeted "Shout out to the good people of Glass, Lewis &amp; Co. for placing a $170 order and not leaving a tip."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-food-truck-fires-worker-gripes-customer-tips-article-1.1414093&lt;/ref&gt; Citing demands from a Glass Lewis representative, O'Connor's employer promptly fired him in response. &lt;ref&gt;http://boingboing.net/2013/07/30/meet-glass-lewis-and-co-the.html&lt;/ref&gt; The official Glass Lewis twitter page, in response to confirmation of O'Connor's termination, then publicly thanked O'Connor's former employer for firing him. &lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/GlassLewis/status/360120598283825152&lt;/ref&gt;

A large and multinational public backlash then ensued with, at some point, as many as 10 statements per second being posted on Twitter demanding either a boycott of Glass Lewis or Milk Truck.&lt;ref&gt;http://gothamist.com/2013/07/30/milk_truck_owner_fired_employee_for.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Policies==
Glass Lewis has stated that it will use its shareholder proxy to vote against boards of directors that are not adequately diverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glass Lewis 2018 Proxy Paper Guidelines|url=http://www.glasslewis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/US_Guidelines_2018.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weinbar|first1=Sharon|title=How big money can drive diversity in venture capital – TechCrunch|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/29/how-big-money-can-drive-diversity-in-venture-capital/|website=techcrunch.com|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11138">'''Help desk software''' refers to a [[computer program]] that enables customer-care operators keep track of user requests and deal with other customer-care-related issues. It is what makes customer-care service efficient and enterprising.&lt;ref name="PC1"&gt;{{cite news | last =Oliver | first =Haslam | title =The Best Help Desk Software of 2015 | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''Pcmag''| date =4 September 2015| url =https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2489457,00.asp | accessdate =11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, help desk software is part of an umbrella category called service desk, which includes asset management and IT service management. Oftentimes, the two terms are used interchangeably. Nevertheless, help desk software specifically refers to the system that addresses customer queries.&lt;ref name="FO"&gt;{{cite news | last =Oliver | first =Haslam | title =Types of Help Desk Software: Which One Will Suit Your Company Needs? | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''Finances Online''| date = | url =http://financesonline.com/types-of-help-desk-software-which-one-will-suit-your-company-needs/ | accessdate =11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, customer service and help desk software systems have become increasingly popular in recent times. According to a recent report, there is massive increase in sales of customer relationship management (CRM) software, which includes help desk software across the globe.
&lt;ref name="ITWC"&gt;{{cite news | last =Gary | first =Hilson | title =Canada lags U.S. in adopting help desk software as email, spreadsheets still prevail | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''IT World Canada''| date =23 July 2015 | url =http://www.itworldcanada.com/article/canada-lags-u-s-in-adopting-help-desk-software-as-email-spreadsheets-still-prevail/376078 | accessdate =11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of help desk software dates back to the 20th century when businesses relied mostly on face-to-face interaction to resolve customer issues. Customers had to visit a company’s store or office with the product to get their problems solved.&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =History of Help Desk Software: Evolution and Future Trends | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''Compare Camp''| date = | url =http://comparecamp.com/history-of-help-desk-software-evolution-and-future-trends/ | accessdate =11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the invention of the telephone in 1876, and the telephone switchboard in the 1890s, help desk assumed a better approach. Customers were able to reach their company and voice out their problem over the phone system.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt; During the 20th century era, companies used mainly equipment like dictation machines, typewriters, and dumb terminals with access to a [[mainframe computer]], to address customer issues. The earliest use of computers for customer service was done through the use of mainframe software. Customers would submit paper forms or communicate their issue by phone to customer service agents who would seek for avenues to handle the issues.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;

In the 1960s, companies began to set up call centers and also train staff to receive and handle customer enquiries in an organized and efficient manner. This was the era of [[Interactive voice response]] (IVR) which became a big boost to telephone customer service system.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt; Later on, Desktop PCs and email significantly improved help desk systems. Customers could communicate their problems by email, bypassing paper forms. Help desk agents could provide status updates and resolutions by email as well.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;

Meanwhile, the actual introduction of help desk systems began in the 1980 when the internet was officially made available for public use.  Many companies started outsourcing their customer service department.  This led to massive use of email and live chat systems in the 1990s. This new development enabled several [[United States|US]] companies to outsource their help desk to low-cost countries like [[India]] and the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;

In any case the real invention of help desk software came in the 2000s when companies began to use diverse kind of software packages to deal with customer-care issues.  This led to the massive production of different kinds of help desk software programs across the internet and the world at large.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt; In recent times, the internet and networked systems make help desk software more interactive and participatory for customers and the agents. Customer can now submit and track their issues more easily.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;

==Basic characteristics==
Help desk software automates customer services in diverse ways. It typically consists of at least three parts. These include Ticket Management, Automation Suite, and Reporting/Optimization.&lt;ref name="KY"&gt;{{cite news | last =Jammi | first =Nandini | title =What Is a Helpdesk? What Isn’t a Helpdesk? | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''Kayako''| date =27 January 2015 | url =https://www.kayako.com/blog/what-is-a-helpdesk/ | accessdate =16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Help desk software has a point of contact for customers to send their queries and a ticketing system that tracks and organizes issues for faster resolution.&lt;ref name="FO"/&gt; It may also have a feature that aggregates and organizes queries and answers into a knowledge base, such as FAQs or guide articles. It may accommodate multiple points of contact; a working dashboard; and analytics section. It may also have a feature that allows agents to escalate issues to a higher level.&lt;ref name="FO"/&gt;

More advanced help desk applications  feature [[Online chat|online chat]], insights and analytics, automated processes, multiple contact channels, reporting tools, collaboration tools, and a CRM feature.&lt;ref name="FO"/&gt;

==Classifications==
Today help desk software is generally classified by its deployment, business size of the target users, or source code accessibility.&lt;ref name="FO"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =SaaS Help Desk Is A Must-Have | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''Cloud Tweaks''| date =16 July 2015 | url =http://cloudtweaks.com/2015/06/survey-says-saas-help-desk-is-a-must-have/ | accessdate =11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic types include:

* Web help desk software
* On-premises help desk software
* Enterprise help desk software
* Open-source help desk software
* Cloud based help desk software

Most brands and models of help desk software in use today fall in one of the classifications outlined above.

==Current trends==
Web-based and cloud-hosted help desk software packages are becoming very popular today. Social network channels are also being widely used as they are both interactive and allow for effective community support. The new generation of help desk software also offers real-time updates and uses remote desktop access.&lt;ref name="FO"/&gt;

==The future of help desk software==
With the massive increase in development and use of help desk software, the future holds more for companies that make use of these system.  Based on current trends, the future projection envisages the following points for the help desk software technology:&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;

* Faster resolution of tickets
* Greater integration of cloud computing
* Greater support  for app and devices
* More use of the remote access methodology 
* Integration of better self-service resources and tools

==Benefits==
The following benefits are typically associated with help desk software:

* Today's help desk software handles complex databases of customer queries, profiles, call reports, resolution logs and service level agreements. A knowledge base, FAQ page, community or live chat can also be part of help desk software.&lt;ref name="FO"/&gt;
* Any business that uses [[webmail]] for support tends to resolve customer support issues quicker and sees an increase in support productivity when they switch to help desk software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Suzanne | first =Kattau | title =5 Tips: Pick the Right Help Desk Software for Your Small or Midsize Business | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''Pcmag''| date =4 September 2014 | url =https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2489868,00.asp | accessdate =11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =How to Find the Right Helpdesk Software to Turbo Charge Your Business | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''huffington Post''| date =2 December 2015 | url =http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andre-bourque/how-to-find-the-right-hel_b_6674220.html | accessdate =11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Help desk software automates tasks such as: ticket categorization and prioritization, ticket routing, alerts and notifications, ticket status management, and so on. With the right help desk solution, workload is cut down as many tasks such as issue tracking, assigning, and ticket management can be automated.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;
* Some cloud-based help desk software have built-in security features, such as HIPAA compliance if for handling US health care information, or GDPR compliance for accepting requests from persons located in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Chloe | first =Green  | title =How to choose the right help desk software: a step-by-step guide | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''Information-age''| date =5 November 2015 | url =http://www.information-age.com/industry/software/123460446/how-choose-right-help-desk-software-step-step-guide | accessdate =11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==
Despite benefits of help desk software, there are some disadvantages related to it as well, mainly:
* Many help desk software platforms have expensive upfront costs as well as time-consuming implementation periods, which can significantly drain company resources. While most offer a trial option, effectively trialing software is difficult and time consuming in a large organization. It's also difficult to evaluate software with a full volume of tickets and staff in a short period of time.
* On-premise help desks can have costs associated with maintenance, upgrades and scheduled downtime of servers, which are borne by the customer, not the help desk software provider.
* Cloud-based help desks can incur higher costs over longer periods of time.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt; Cloud-based help desk software can become partially or entirely unavailable to users without an Internet connection. Consequently, unexpected disruptions in Internet connection may make such services temporarily unavailable.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;

Many of the problems listed above can easily be surmounted if proper research, planning and inquiries are made beforehand.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;

Soon, thanks to the ethically questionable advice in the book, he rises to Vice-President in Charge of Advertising, making sure that each person above him gets either fired or moved or transferred within the company.

Finch begins to fall in love with Rosemary Pilkington, a secretary at the company. Finch finds out that the president of the company, J. B. Biggley, has made advances towards Hedy LaRue, a beautiful but incompetent woman the company has hired. Finch uses this information to assist his climb on the corporate ladder.

Biggley's annoying nephew, Bud Frump, also takes advantage of the situation and tries to get to the top before Finch. By story's end, however, Finch has become chairman of the board, and might make the White House his next step to success.

The '''&lt;big&gt;I-VMS&lt;/big&gt;''' Model ('''&lt;big&gt;I&lt;/big&gt;'''ntegrated '''&lt;big&gt;V&lt;/big&gt;'''alue-added '''&lt;big&gt;M&lt;/big&gt;'''anagement '''&lt;big&gt;S&lt;/big&gt;'''ystem) is emphasizes the surplus-value creation of to achieves the radically new approach in economics science by in practice applicable, the management of human resources potential based.
In the collaboration implemented company's management model is able to increase efficiency in the management of organizational / structural unit without their conversion. The model is a value-enhancing, integrated, networked, three-dimensional complex -internal value-based- control system, which allows for more efficient management.

== Abstract ==
In the [[management]]'s world the principles, basic competences and basic priority's identifications are the key-importance, because these determine the values of [[internal relations]] and concepts, which derive a reasonable activities of the organizations and ultimately the company's earnings.
The management researchers over the past several decades, the theoretical concept have been created, which model-like-uses given much impetus to the perception of [[business manager]]s, the value of corporate processes and more accurate perceptions of the various interests involved in a more realistic choice. This thesis presents a new [[management model]] theoretical concept's which is eliminates the main mistakes of the previous models and combining the management's resources in a radically new integrated system oriented approach, while allowing the management's higher level control ever then before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bogel | first = György |author2=Salamonné Huszty Anna | title = Vállalatvezetés felsőfokon | year = 1998 | publisher = Kossuth kiadó | location = Budapest|isbn=963-09-4049-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Csath | first = Magdolna | title = Stratégiai tervezés a és vezetés a 21. században | year = 2004 | publisher = Nemzeti Tankönyvkiadó | location = Budapest|isbn=963-19-5251-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = E.Porter | first = Michel | title = Competitive Advantage | year = 1985 | publisher = The free press | location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The theoretical foundation of model ==
The I-VMS management model would like to do to central idea the value-creating process therefore it remain be competitive, however would be built to an advanced, integrated networked-system-model. The developed management model fit to the most modern challenges and demands with the following requirements:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Salamonné Huszty | first = Anna | title = Jövőkép és stratégiaalkotás | year = 2000 | publisher = Kossuth kiadó | location = Budapest|isbn=963-09-4194-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Marosán | first = György | title = A 21. század stratégiai menedzsmentje | year = 2003 | publisher = Műszaki kiadó | location = Budapest|isbn=963-16-6008-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For value relation ===
# keep the [[value creation]] process is a central, system-forming role;
# keep the value creation process’s progression logic;
# keep the double value creation’s philosophy.

=== For functional structure ===
* applicability: like the earlier [[value-chain model]]s to be able to cooperate with traditional functional and hierarchical [[organizational structure]] without to eliminate them;
* interoperability: i.e. to assist in dismantling the too rigid and too-positioned functional structure and to assist in disbanding the organizational barriers;
* expandable-ity: i.e. when appear new features or change the strategy to be able to accommodate to the new functional elements.

=== For linear, chain-like structure and process approach ===
* network structure: i.e. for chain-like structure instead of a new more flexible networked structure to appear in the process approach and it disappears the functional walls;
* complex process approach: continue to preserves the complexity of the process approach on overall process's performance;
* focus point: the value creation not be a process's outcome but the process to build itself around the values and focus point.

=== For integration ===
* integration: i.e. in the coordination of function allows the higher level of integration as a chain-like model;
* information relations: i.e. the high level of integration allows the [[information]]’s free flow and the allows more extensive information relations;
* synergy: i.e. in organizational function’s performance be creating a high level of [[synergy]].

=== System approach ===
* granularity: i.e. the created [[logical data model|logical model]] be resolvable - optionally - to same built logical sub-systems by test criteria;
* synthesize-able: i.e. the system-forming elements can be able to other logic incorporate with other elements or additional elements may be incorporated therein;
* variability: i.e. the system components can be varied to thereby provide a new perspective for management.

Summary: the new management model for the linear functional approach instead of to be function as a network, system approach model, which is much more advanced in the present age is much better suited to the challenges of the management approach lends perspective. The main advantages of the new management concept can be allow the cooperation between organization's traditional structures and can help to remove the organization's functional barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Johnson G. |author2=Scholes K. | title = Exploring corporate strategy | year = 1997 | publisher = Prentice Hall | location = Europe|isbn=0-13-525619-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Husti | first = István | title = Innováció menedzsment elemei | year = 2010 | publisher = Szent István egyetem | location = Gödöllő }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = E.

== The model’s presentation ==
The integrated value-creating and value-adding management system’s (as I-VMS) essence is: do not concentrate to value-creating activities chain but allows a new three pillar system-approach which is realize the activities integrated conception.

The system-model is finding basic- and support focus areas synergy.

''„This technology place the conscious management to center and give back the control to management’s hands overall values and processes more in [[complex system]]s too.”''

In the model applied an integrated systematic-approach is breaking the previous function-approach so it allows the cooperation of certain areas activity without domination, competing in cooperation of the value-dimension increase, but some areas set to center (to focus point) and creates increase and concentration of the value-dimension. In the presented model system approach's advantages is the [[multi-granularity]], which has a result of all the system-constituents with the same of modeling technique to analyze further in the desired depth. The subsystems are integrated into broader scheme, while are exploring the inner structure and are set up network connections.
The synthesizable advantage is that the individual components are building as blocks, or molecular way to more complicated structures to form, while its preserves in the simply a transparent structure through the focus-triples.

On demand developed dynamic relationships are shaping the model's variability, i.e. is built a logical system which is adapt to the testing organization or it is give a new approach and new perspectives to management in the value's coordination.

The basic idea of the [[model structure]] can be traced back to the so-called focus triplets. All of system unit based on three core-functions (i.e. the main or primary focus-area), and three support operations (i.e., complementary or supporting focus-area).The core and supporting activities are not linked to the chain-like, but targeted to the same focus areas. The core and supporting activities can be represents by two interlocked triangles, which are constitute goal-directed focus-triplets.

=== The 1&lt;small&gt;st&lt;/small&gt; level of model (management control) ===
The management is on the [[focus point]] of model's first level which performance can be primarily maximized. The management function's maximize is means the management can be able to understand and recognizing the [[consumer]] needs, so can be able to convert to optimized organization-function, so that during the process generate maximum customer-value.

=== The 2&lt;small&gt;nd&lt;/small&gt; level of model (basic activities as sub-systems) ===
The model's second level is based on the main-function's analysis which primarily contributes to the management's performance.

''The effective innovation’s bases:''
* functions which can be able to perception the consumer needs;
* the given performance to the needs of perception parts by customer;
* realization’s functions which define the performance.

''The effective human resource’s bases:''
* the features which to allow detection of psychic factors (personal goals);
* motivation and incentive function-system;
* regular education and training, which makes it possible to achieve new levels.

''The bases of effective financial:''
* [[market strategy]] development and application-awareness in the organization;
* monitoring of financial transaction processes and their function;
* material sense, transaction monitoring processes and their functions.

The [[functional analysis]] in an integrated approach to provide an interesting perspective which are legible and explore from dimension of support-activities links. Some of the functions multiple appearance attention at [[multifunctionality]] and multi-dimensional goal-system.

=== The 3&lt;small&gt;rd&lt;/small&gt; level of model (support activities, as sub-systems) ===
The model's third level based on the support activity’s deeper analysis which is themselves contribution greatly to the base-activities core power level or through the base-activities edges of triangles manifested synergy.

Complex model (total dimensional of [[ganglion network]] structure): 
Although the new model is not directly intended, but it can be the complex system's system elements integrity and complex representation which provides profitable links and management perspectives through the analysis.

=== The 4&lt;small&gt;th&lt;/small&gt; level of model (the logistics or model’s extension) ===
The model is suitable to show the complex network of activities and the management can be find more useful interfaces with their analysis. Further modeling aspect can be realize points represent the modeling aspect, if we step out of a two-dimensional representation's  constraint and we will create a real three-dimensional network model.

Possible to show the [[logistics]] functions with three-dimensional shift which is overlap with management's previously shown support activities. The resulting layout highlights is shows the necessary central role of the logistics management which is gives projection of entire organization operational material and information flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dobák | first = Miklós | title = Szervezeti Magatartás és Vezetés | year = 2013 | publisher = KJK-KERSZOV jogi és Üzleti Kiadó Kft. | location = Budapest }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dobák | first = Miklós | title = Folyamatok fejlesztése és változásvezetés | year = 1999 | publisher = Harvard Business Manager, vol. 1999 / 3, pp. 69-76 Budapesti Műszaki és Gazdaságtudományi Egyetem GTK | location = Budapest }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fülöp | first = Gyula | title = A globális vállalati stratégiák | year = 2001 | publisher = Aula kiadó | location = Budapest|isbn=963-9345-54-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logistics has a prominent role in the I-VMS Model ==
The integrated system-approach management model has a primary merit: central role of [[logistics]] in the Model by I-VMS's structural advantage.
Management, as managing, organizing and strategic focus area, cannot function without adequate information and support. Management needs to have a basic support, but at the same time cooperating organizational units, such as logistics, which is driving the quality and strategic value of information set will perform.

– Over the logistics function, focus-triplet model's examination we are obtaining the management's projection, which is the same as the support functions of management's extension. In other words, the management's support activities are consistent with logistics core functions.

By placing the logistics into a high priority, i.e. key position the model can be properly manage the interoperability between the value dimensions. The model is can be capable to mapping the complex activity-network and with analysis of interfaces the management can be found for further valuable intervention points. The aforementioned three-dimensional network model provides give additional modeling aspect to analysis.

A graphical spatial offset representation of the logistics function can be possible, which is overlap by the logistics core functions over the management's previously shown support functions. The received layout is necessarily highlights the central role of logistics management, which can be representing the overall organizational financial and operational information flow. In other words, the logistics can be integrating the other management (information and financial) functions.
This approach in practice is useful because it helps to understand the real value-formation and flow structure, while avoiding the previously mentioned value torsion, which stems from some features (for example: [[marketing]]) excessive emphasis.

The logistics department has a central role in the management to give a new approach to management which the information and material type of market structure in a useful gain first mover advantage. A new kind of light will be on strategic planning, which includes not only the material things in management, but also the values and surplus-value recognition and also deal with the integration strategy.
According to the model are often rated at the bottom of logistics has no longer a secondary role in a company by strategic planning and key performing unit, but also has serious and formers harmony-creator function.

The model's innovation is that: over the two-dimensional can be increase the value dimensions and with endowed key-position role can be bring new concept into the company management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Szegedi | first = Zoltán |author2=Prezenszki József | title = Logisztika-menedzsment | year = 2003 | publisher = Kossuth kiadó | location = Budapest|isbn=963-09-4434-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = E.

'''Isoelectric focusing''' ('''IEF'''), also known as '''electrofocusing''', is a technique for separating different [[molecules]] by differences in their [[isoelectric point]] (pI).&lt;ref name="BjellqvistEk1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bjellqvist|first1=Bengt|last2=Ek|first2=Kristina|last3=Giorgio Righetti|first3=Pier|last4=Gianazza|first4=Elisabetta|last5=Görg|first5=Angelika|last6=Westermeier|first6=Reiner|last7=Postel|first7=Wilhelm|title=Isoelectric focusing in immobilized pH gradients: Principle, methodology and some applications|journal=Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods|volume=6|issue=4|year=1982|pages=317–339|issn=0165022X|doi=10.1016/0165-022X(82)90013-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Righetti2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pier Giorgio Righetti|title=Isoelectric Focusing: Theory, Methodology and Application|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvs2kxOINWIC&amp;pg=PP2|date=1 April 2000|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-085880-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of zone [[electrophoresis]], usually performed on [[protein]]s in a [[gel electrophoresis|gel]], that takes advantage of the fact that overall charge on the molecule of interest is a function of the [[pH]] of its surroundings.

==Procedure==
IEF involves adding an [[Amphoterism|ampholyte]] solution into [[immobilized pH gradient]] (IPG) gels. IPGs are the acrylamide gel matrix co-polymerized with the pH gradient, which result in completely stable gradients except the most alkaline (&gt;12) pH values. The immobilized pH gradient is obtained by the continuous change in the ratio of ''immobilines''. An immobiline is a weak acid or base defined by its pK value.

A protein that is in a pH region below its [[isoelectric point]] (pI) will be positively charged and so will migrate towards the cathode (negatively charged electrode). As it migrates through a gradient of increasing pH, however, the protein's overall charge will decrease until the protein reaches the pH region that corresponds to its pI. At this point it has no net charge and so migration ceases (as there is no electrical attraction towards either electrode).  As a result, the proteins become focused into sharp stationary bands with each protein positioned at a point in the pH gradient corresponding to its pI. The technique is capable of extremely high resolution with proteins differing by a single charge being fractionated into separate bands.

Molecules to be focused are distributed over a medium that has a pH gradient (usually created by [[aliphatic]] [[ampholyte]]s). An [[electric current]] is passed through the medium, creating a "positive" [[anode]] and "negative" [[cathode]] end. Negatively charged molecules migrate through the pH gradient in the medium toward the "positive" end while positively charged molecules move toward the "negative" end. As a particle moves towards the pole opposite of its charge it moves through the changing pH gradient until it reaches a point in which the pH of that molecules isoelectric point is reached.  At this point the molecule no longer has a net electric charge (due to the protonation or deprotonation of the associated functional groups) and as such will not proceed any further within the gel. The gradient is established before adding the particles of interest by first subjecting a solution of small molecules such as [[ampholyte|polyampholyte]]s with varying pI values to electrophoresis.

The method is applied particularly often in the study of [[protein]]s, which separate based on their relative content of [[acidic]] and [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] [[Amino acid|residues]], whose value is represented by the pI. Proteins are introduced into an [[Immobilized pH gradient]] gel composed of [[polyacrylamide]], [[starch]], or [[agarose]] where a pH gradient has been established. Gels with large pores are usually used in this process to eliminate any "sieving" effects, or artifacts in the pI caused by differing migration rates for proteins of differing sizes. Isoelectric focusing can resolve proteins that differ in [[Isoelectric point|pI]] value by as little as 0.01.&lt;ref&gt;Stryer, Lubert: "Biochemie", page 50. Spektrum Akademischer Verlag, 1996 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Isoelectric focusing is the first step in [[two-dimensional gel electrophoresis]], in which proteins are first separated by their pI and then further separated by [[molecular weight]] through [[SDS-PAGE]].

==Living cells==
According to some opinions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Flegr J |title=Does a cell perform isoelectric focusing? |journal=BioSystems |volume=24 |pages=127–133 |year=1990 |url=http://natur.cuni.cz/flegr/pdf/isoel.pdf |doi= 10.1016/0303-2647(90)90005-L |pmid= 2249006 |issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Baskin E.F. |author2=Bukshpan S |author3=Zilberstein G V |title=pH-induced intracellular protein transport |journal=Physical Biology |volume=3 |pages=101–106 |year=2006 |doi=10.1088/1478-3975/3/2/002 |pmid=16829696 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; living [[eukaryotic]] cells perform isoelectric focusing of proteins in their interior to overcome a limitation of the rate of metabolic reaction by diffusion of enzymes and their reactants, and to regulate the rate of particular biochemical processes. By concentrating the enzymes of particular metabolic pathways into distinct and small regions of its interior, the cell can increase the rate of particular biochemical pathways by several orders of magnitude. By modification of the isoelectric point (pI) of molecules of an enzyme by, e.g., [[phosphorylation]] or dephosphorylation, the cell can transfer molecules of the enzyme between different parts of its interior, to switch on or switch off particular biochemical processes.

==Microfluidic chip based==
Microchip based electrophoresis is a promising alternative to [[capillary electrophoresis]] since it has the potential to provide rapid protein analysis, straightforward integration with other microfluidic unit operations, whole channel detection, nitrocellulose films, smaller sample sizes and lower fabrication costs.

==Multi-junction==
The increased demand for faster and easy-to-use protein separation tools has accelerated the evolution of IEF towards in-solution separations. In this context, a multi-junction IEF system was developed to perform fast and gel-free IEF separations. The multi-junction IEF system utilizes a series of vessels with a capillary passing through each vessel.&lt;ref name = "pmid26531800" /&gt; Part of the capillary in each vessel is replaced by a semipermeable membrane. The vessels contain buffer solutions with different pH values, so that a pH gradient is effectively established inside the capillary. The buffer solution in each vessel has an electrical contact with a voltage divider connected to a high-voltage power supply, which established electrical field along the capillary. When a sample (a mixture of peptides or proteins) is injected in the capillary, the presence of the electrical field and the pH gradient separates these molecules according to their isoelectric points. The multi-junction IEF system has been used to separate tryptic peptide mixtures for two-dimensional proteomics &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pirmoradian, M. |author2=Zhang, B. |author3=Chingin, K. |author4=Astorga-Wells, J. |author5=Zubarev R.A. |title=Membrane-assisted isoelectric focusing device as a micro-preparative fractionator for two dimensional shotgun proteomics |journal=Analytical Chemistry |volume=86 | issue = 12 |pages=5728–5732 |year=2014 |doi= 10.1021/ac404180e |pmid=24824042}}&lt;/ref&gt; and blood plasma proteins from [[Alzheimer’s disease]] patients for biomarker discovery.&lt;ref name = "pmid26531800"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pirmoradian M. |author2=Astorga-Wells, J., Zubarev, RA. |title=Multijunction Capillary Isoelectric Focusing Device Combined with Online Membrane-Assisted Buffer Exchanger Enables Isoelectric Point Fractionation of Intact Human Plasma Proteins for Biomarker Discovery. |journal=Analytical Chemistry |volume=87 |issue=23 |pages=11840–11846 |year=2015 |pmid=26531800 |doi=10.1021/acs.analchem.5b03344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7201">'''James Alexander Lyons''' (1861 - 1920) was an American accountancy author, and publisher, known for publishing a series of books on bookkeeping and accountancy in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Henry Kramer (1920) ''Experimental Research as a Factor in Commercial Education.'' 1920. p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joachim Ingendahl (1990) ''Die Kapitalflussrechnung im Rechnungslegungsrecht der USA und der Bundesrepublik Deutschland.'' p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The first work Lyons published was the 1896 textbook entitled "A treatise on business practice," which was designed as  textbook for all business schools and as reference for all classes.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons (1896, p. 5)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Lyons had started his commercial textbook business in cooperation with Orville Marcellus Powers (1852-1910s) under the name Powers &amp; Lyons in the 1890s. One of the first books were "The new business arithmetic; a treatise on commercial Calculations," first published in 1893, and "The complete accountant: Designed for the use of schools and private study : a book of reference for the counting house, embodying the latest forms and methods in use in the best business houses," first published in 1898. Both books were authored by Powers, and ran in several editions.

The firm Powers &amp; Lyons had been dissolved in 1909, and Lyons assumes full ownership, continuing the business under the name of J. A. Lyons &amp; Company.&lt;ref&gt;''Wisconsin Journal of Education.'' Vol. 41, (1909). p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911 James W. Carnahan joined the firm, who had been general representative of the Ginn &amp; Company publishing company. The publishing company changed its name in Lyons and Carnahan.&lt;ref&gt;''Moderator-topics,'' Vol. 32. (1911), p. 578&lt;/ref&gt; Based in Chicago, the company continued to concentrated on publishing textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;Carl B. Cone (2015). ''The University of Kentucky: A Pictorial History.'' p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Modern corporation accounting,'' 1908 ===
The purpose of the 1908 ''Modern corporation accounting,'' was to show students what a corporation is, and how it is created; to give them in concise form a correct idea of those accounts which belong peculiarly to corporation bookkeeping, and the original entries which affect those accounts; and to illustrate several processes of closing the ledger of a corporation and distributing corporation profits. While studying these things, observing students will learn much that will be of general benefit and that will serve to guide them in possible future dealings with corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons 1908, p. 5)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bookkeeping: Classification of Loss or Gain Accounts ===
In ''Modern corporation accounting,'' (1908) Lyons picture some of the transactions and entries which are peculiar to corporations and corporation accounting. In doing so, he presents one of the earliest modern flow diagrams of cost accounting. These relation was originally pictured  by [[Emile Garcke]] and [[J. M. Fells]] in their [[Emile Garcke#System of factory accounting|System of factory accounting]] from 1889. Lyons had symplified these relations into one single flow diagram:

[[File:Relation of the various loss or gain accounts, 1908.jpg|thumb|600px|center|Relation of the various loss or gain accounts, 1908]]

Lyon explained that the above diagram shows the relation of the various loss or gain accounts to each other, and indicates what account each group of accounts closes into. Out-Freight, Cash Discount Dr., and the Sales Book total, close into the Sales account. Manufacturing Labor, Manufacturing Expense, Materials, and Materials Expense close into Production (after In-Freight and Cash Discount Cr., which are subordinate to Materials, have been closed into Materials). Sales and Production, which now exhibit respectively the net returns on merchandise and the gross cost of manufacture, are closed into Implements, which is the Merchandise account.

'''John Duncan Anderson''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|MNZM|size=85%}} is a New Zealand businessman, author and celebrity speaker.  He is  the founder of the travel and leisure company [[Contiki Tours]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://contiki.co.nz/pages/1-about-contiki About Contiki]&lt;/ref&gt; The company is now owned by Trafalgar Tours, itself a division of [[The Travel Corporation]]

==Personal life==
Anderson was born in [[Wellington]], New Zealand in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;''Only Two Seats Left'', autobiography published in 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He is married to Ali (Alison), a passenger who fell ill on one of Contiki's first tours.  They have four children.

Anderson's parents divorced when he was five years old; he was raised primarily by his mother although maintained a good relationship with his father, a dentist who emigrated to England when he was a child.

Anderson emigrated to England in 1961, returning to New Zealand in 1979 with a wife and family.  He lived in [[Auckland]] for many years and currently lives in [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]], [[Marlborough Region|Marlborough]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.speakerlink.co.nz/PresentersProfileView.asp?pid=24 Speaker Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2012 New Year Honours (New Zealand)|2012 New Year Honours]], Anderson was appointed a [[New Zealand Order of Merit|Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit]] for services to tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.dpmc.govt.nz/publications/new-year-honours-list-2012 | title=New Year honours list 2012|date=31 December 2011 | publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet | accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10776022"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10776022 |title=New Year's Honours: John Anderson |author=Wade, Amelia |date=31 December 2011 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overseas experience==
In 1960 Anderson travelled to London, England where his father was living.  Anderson planned his route to England to include many stopovers en route.  As the president of his local [[Junior Chamber International|Jaycees]] association, Anderson contacted fellow presidents in the cities that he planned and received many offers to host him.  In this way, Anderson was able to defray his travel costs considerably.

In his book ''Only Two Seats Left''&lt;ref&gt;[http://theartscentrebookshop.circlesoft.net/catalog/296020/14798 Autobiography Review]&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson describes his travels with a mixture of awe and sense of adventure.  This was Anderson's first travel outside of New Zealand which at that time had a population of just over 2 million.&lt;ref&gt;[1960 in New Zealand]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The first tours==
Arriving in England in 1962, Anderson set about planning a trip to see Europe however had only £25 to his name Anderson came up with the idea of advertising for 11 other young [[Australasia]]ns to join him on the trip.  He worked out the total costs for the trip and then divided by 11, thus providing a free seat for himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celebspeakers.com/speaker/john-anderson/ ''Celebrity Speakers New Zealand'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The trip sold quickly, assisted by Anderson meeting prospective fellow travellers and exaggerating his experience of Europe.  In fact, his only previous experience of Europe was an overnight trip to Paris.  Shortly after having sold all the seats, Anderson was approached by two more prospective passengers.  Anderson decided to take advantage of the interest and advertise a second tour to operate following the first.  This second tour also sold well and sold out before the first tour departed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unlimited.co.nz/unlimited.nsf/growth/on-the-road-again Unlimited Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Anderson's inexperience the tour was a success.  Anderson admitted his lack of European knowledge to his customers on the first day.  After that, he and the eleven others shared duties and decision making, including driving duties in the 12 seater Commer van they christened ''Tiki'' after the [[Tiki|Maori good luck charm]]

For the second tour Anderson had increased the price from £100 to £115 per person.  Despite this, upon arrival in Monaco Anderson found he had nearly run out of money and would be unable to complete the advertised itinerary.  Anderson worked out the amount of money that he would need to express the group directly back to England and took the remaining funds to a casino where he gambled on the [[roulette]] tables.  He won and was able to continue the tour without his customers finding out.

==Contiki Holidays==
The trips which had begun as an exercise to fund his own travels around Europe became a fast-growing business; fleet and staff grew rapidly and a number of new tours were developed under the name ''Tiki Tours'', in recognition of the company's first vehicle.

When the [[Tourism New Zealand|New Zealand Tourist Board]] challenged Anderson over his use of the name ''Tiki Tours'' he changed the company's name to ''Contiki'', the ''con'' coming from [[Continental Europe|The ''Con''tinent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2005/02/25/1109180077418.html Sydney Morning Herald]&lt;/ref&gt;

Contiki grew to include tours worldwide.  During the 1980s the company began to diversify from its roots as a tour company for 18- to 35-year-olds (originally 19 to 29).  Examples included building hotel resorts in Queenstown and in the Great Barrier Reef, and the purchase of [[Fullers Ferries]].

By the mid 1980s Contiki was a global organisation headquartered in Hong Kong.  Anderson was living in New Zealand and travelled frequently for directors meetings and to review the company's operations.

===Sale of Contiki===
In the early 1980s Anderson sold down his investment in Contiki, allowing fellow directors to invest as shareholders.  In 1985 Omnicorp, a company controlled by [[Lloyd Morrison]] purchased a 50% stake in the business.

The [[Black Monday (1987)|stock market crash of 1987]] devalued many of Contiki's assets.  This, along with the poor performance of recent acquisitions, notably Fullers Ferries, placed Anderson in financial difficulty. In 1989 he was forced to sell his remaining shares in Contiki as well as his family home to avoid bankruptcy.

==After Contiki==
During the early 1990s Anderson was employed to sell off the assets of former Contiki empire.  His wife Ali returned to full-time work to supplement their income.  They briefly owned and ran a chain of stores&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nileguide.com/destination/auckland/restaurants/global-sandwich/1013153 ''Global Sandwich'' review]&lt;/ref&gt; in Auckland selling packaged sandwiches.  The business was short-lived and they moved to Blenheim in the late 1990s. Along with Contours Travel, John has started tours to South America for 'baby boomers'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celebrityspeakers.com.au/entrepreneur-speakers/john-anderson/ Speaker Profile of John Anderson at The Celebrity Speakers Bureau]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public speaking===
In recent years Anderson has taken up public speaking as a profession and has presented his Contiki story to many businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celebspeakers.com/john-anderson/ Celebrity Speakers biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Only Two Seats Left''===
In 2010 Anderson published ''Only Two Seats Left'', an autobiography that focuses mainly on his time with Contiki from 1961 to 1989.

'''Jorge Carlos Vergara Madrigal''' ({{IPA-es|'xoɾxe βeɾˈɣaɾa}}) (born 3 March 1955) is a Mexican businessman and film producer. Vergara is a [[billionaire]] 
with a net worth of approximately $1.5 billion. He is the founder of [[Grupo Omnilife]], one of the top 200 corporations in Mexico. 
In addition to its health products business, Grupo Omnilife owns the [[association football|football]] clubs [[Club Deportivo Guadalajara]] and Chivas Hefei, including a fleet of private jets and real estate.

Vergara has also produced internationally recognized films such as ''[[The Assassination of Richard Nixon]]'' and the Oscar-nominated ''[[Y tu mamá también]]'' through the production company, Producciones Anhelo.

==Career==

===Business===
Born in [[Guadalajara, Jalisco]], Vergara once sold tacos on Mexican streets. Back in the 1980s Vergara sold condominiums and timeshares in [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]], Mexico, where he met and began working with John Peterson.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

When Peterson became a [[Herbalife]] salesperson, he recruited Vergara and together they began selling Herbalife products in Mexico. Since Herbalife had not received Mexican government approval to sell their products, Peterson and Vergara had to smuggle the products into the country. After six months of smuggling the products into Mexico, Herbalife took notice and began the process of getting government approval. Vergara was asked to help get the Herbalife products approved by the Mexican government and was instrumental in helping Herbalife's founder, Mark Hughes deal with the Mexican Government. This gave Vergara insight into how a [[Multi-level marketing|multi-level company]] profits and expands into other countries.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Vergara was partners with Roger Daley, Jim Fobair and Charlie Ragus. With already the 51% of the company, Vergara acquired the rest of Omnitrition at the end of the deal with his U.S. partners and took the whole control of Omnitrition de Mexico.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Since its foundation in 1991, the privately owned corporation has grown from one company, Omnilife de Mexico, to comprise nineteen companies.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Today, approximately 5.2 million people distribute Omnilife products in 22 countries, while the company has reached annual sales of nearly $4.2 billion.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Vergara has been the director of Omnilife de Mexico since 1991.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/hispanicheritage2008/news/story?id=3642048 |title=Chivas USA holding its own in Southern California market - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=15 October 2008 |accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
In 1999 Vergara met film director [[Alfonso Cuarón]] while seeking out filmmakers for his corporate movies. Cuarón, however, was more interested in filming ''[[Y tu mamá también]]'', and gave Vergara the screenplay. A known lover of films, Vergara read it and right away proposed that they begin production. In the process they established a production company [[Producciones Anhelo]] that would go on to co-produce [[Guillermo del Toro]]'s ''[[El Espinazo Del Diablo]]'' (''The Devil's Backbone''), along with [[Pedro Almodóvar]]'s [[El Deseo]] and del Toro's [https://www.imdb.com/company/co0040776/ Tequila Gang]. Anhelo also produced [[Sebastián Cordero]]'s ''[[Crónicas]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 2002, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' named Vergara one of its Ten Producers to Watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2002/scene/markets-festivals/10-to-watch-jorge-vergara-1117867479/|title=10 to Watch: Jorge Vergara|last=Tegel|first=Simeon|date=2002-05-14|work=Variety|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2004 edition of the [[Guadalajara Film Festival]], Vergara created the JVC Award for Best Director, which was given to Fernando Eimbcke for his feature debut [[Temporada de patos]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Chivas===
Vergara gained ownership of the [[Association football|football]] team [[Club Deportivo Guadalajara]] (popularly known as ''Chivas'') in 2002. Shortly after he took ownership in Mexico, while attending the 2004 U.S. [[Major League Soccer]] All-Star Game, he announced intentions to expand Chivas to MLS.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Vergara and MLS inaugurated [[Chivas USA]] in 2004, and the team played its first official season in 2005 with [[StubHub Center]] in the Los Angeles area as its home stadium. Chivas USA was initially successful; in its first five seasons of operation, the team recorded four straight MLS playoff appearances.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Both performance and attendance declined sharply after 2009.&lt;ref name="Baxter"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-mls-chivas-usa-20130530,0,1160192.story|title=When will MLS save Chivas USA from itself?|last=Baxter|first=Kevin|date=30 May 2013|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Vergara and his former wife became sole owners of the club, buying out former partners Antonio and Lorenzo Cué.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2012/08/29/vergara-fuentes-become-sole-owners-chivas-usa |title=Vergara, Fuentes become sole owners of Chivas USA |publisher=MLSsoccer.com |date= |accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 February 2014, Major League Soccer purchased Chivas USA from Vergara. They announced plans to sell to a buyer dedicated to keeping the club in Los Angeles, as well as a plan to rebrand the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MLS Communications |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2014/02/20/major-league-soccer-purchases-chivas-usa |title=Major League Soccer purchases Chivas USA |publisher=MLSsoccer.com |date= |accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team, no longer affiliated with Vergara, has the working name [[Los Angeles Football Club]], and began MLS play in 2018.

==Personal life==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=October 2017}}
Vergara has six children: Yelena Vergara Zatarain, Amaury Vergara Zatarian, Kenya Vergara Zatarain, Uma Vergara Lerdo de Tejada, Valentina Vergara and Mariaignacia Vergara.

Jorge Vergara divorced Angélica Fuentes Téllez in 21 September 2015. Jorge Vergara and Rossana Lerdo de Tejada were married 10 June 2017 in Guadalajara, Jalisco, México.

The '''Karolinska Institute''' ('''KI'''; {{lang-sv|Karolinska Institutet}};&lt;ref&gt;Karolinska Institutets Varumärkesplattform (Swedish) Revised Nov 2014, Page 20 https://internwebben.ki.se/sites/default/files/regler_vmplattform_nov2014_4_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes known as the '''(Royal) Caroline Institute''' in English&lt;ref&gt;''Nobel Foundation Directory''.  2003. Stockholm : Nobel Foundation, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Council of Science Museums. 2005. ''Nobel Prize Winners in Pictures with CD-ROM''. Delhi: Foundation Books, p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Medical school|medical university]] in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]] within the [[Stockholm urban area]] of [[Sweden]]. It is recognised as Sweden's best university and one of the largest, most prestigious [[medical universities]] in the world. The [[Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute]] awards the Nobel Prize in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]]. The assembly consists of fifty professors from various medical disciplines at the university. The current [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of Karolinska Institute is [[Ole Petter Ottersen]], who took office in August 2017.

The Karolinska Institute was founded in 1810 on the island of [[Kungsholmen]] on the west side of [[Stockholm]]; the main [[campus]] was relocated decades later to Solna, just outside [[Stockholm Municipality|Stockholm]].  A second campus was established more recently in [[Flemingsberg]], [[Huddinge Municipality|Huddinge]], south of Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;http://ki.se/en/about/ki-through-the-centuries retrieved: 8 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The Karolinska Institute is consistently ranked among the top medical universities internationally in a number of ranking tables.

The Karolinska Institute is Sweden's third oldest medical school, after [[Uppsala University]] (founded in 1477) and [[Lund University]] (founded in 1666). It is one of Sweden's largest centres for training and research, accounting for 30% of the medical training and more than 40% of all academic medical and life science research conducted in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ki.se/en/research/research-at-karolinska-institutet|title=Research at Karolinska|access-date=14 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313035349/http://ki.se/en/research/research-at-karolinska-institutet|archive-date=13 March 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Karolinska University Hospital]], located in Solna and Huddinge, is associated with the university as a research and teaching hospital. Together they form an [[academic health science centre]]. While most of the medical programs are taught in Swedish, the bulk of the [[Ph.D.]] projects are conducted in English. The institute's name is a reference to the [[Caroleans]].

== History ==

[[File:Gamla Karolinska Instututet 01.JPG|250px|thumb|Original Caroline Institute buildings at street ''Hantverkargatan'' in Kungsholmen, Stockholm]]

===19th century ===
The Karolinska Institute was founded by King [[Karl XIII]] on 13 December 1810 as an "academy for the training of skilled army surgeons" after one in three soldiers wounded in the [[Finnish War|Finnish War against Russia]] died in field hospitals. Indeed, a report of the time came to the conclusion that "the medical skills of the army barber-surgeons are manifestly inadequate, so Sweden needs to train surgeons in order to better prepare the country for future wars." Just one year later, in 1811, the Karolinska Institute was granted license to train not only surgeons but medical practitioners in general.

[[Image:Kungsholmens glasbruk 1865.jpg|thumb|left|The institute's original building as it appeared in the early 1860s]]
As one of KI's first professors, [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]] laid the foundations of the newly inaugurated institute's scientific orientation, which in  1816 is granted the name ''Carolinska Institutet'' (in reference to the [[Caroleans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Risling M, Bellander BM, Cullheim S |title=Traumatic injuries in the nervous system |journal=Front Neurol |volume=3 |issue= |pages=26 |year=2012 |pmid=22375136 |pmc=3285774 |doi=10.3389/fneur.2012.00026}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This name, however, didn't really make an impact at the time and so was expanded to ''Carolinska Medico Chirurgiska institutet'', which proved more popular, especially when preceded by the epithet ''Kongliga'' (Royal), as introduced in 1822. This original institute was situated in the Royal Bakery on [[Riddarholmen]] (a small but central island in Stockholm) and within a just a couple of years had grown to encompass four professorships in anatomy, natural history and pharmacy, theoretical medicine and practical medicine (internal medicine and surgery).

At around the same time Anders Johan Hagströmer, a professor of anatomy and surgery from the Collegium Medicum (the National Board of Health and Welfare of its day), was appointed the institute's first inspector, a post equivalent to today's president. In the same year, the institute moved to the old Glasbruk quarter on Norr Mälarstrand, beside what is now the City Hall. The move across the waters of [[Riddarfjärden]] was accomplished with the help of barges, one of which is said to have capsized, consigning parts of Hagströmer's collection of preparations to the lake bed. Despite this his library survives intact and today forms part of the KI-Swedish Society of Medicine museum at the institute's Hagströmer Library.

[[Image:Widerström, Karolina ur Cederschöld; En banbryterska (1913).jpg|upright|thumb|In 1884 [[Karolina Widerström]] became the first woman to obtain a degree from the Karolinska Institute.]]
In 1861 the institute reached a significant milestone in being awarded the right to confer its own degrees; as such it was granted a status equal to that of a university. This, in turn, led to an increase in the size of the student body, necessitating the demolition of the old building on the Glasbruk plot and its replacement with a new, larger one. This new institute building was built in stages, mostly during the 1880s and into the first decade of the 20th century; it stands to this day, and has remained largely unchanged since its opening.

[[Image:Caroline Institute 1906 Stockholm.jpg|thumb|left|The Karolinska Institute's main building in 1906]]
Although it had already gained the right to confer general degrees, KI wasn't licensed to confer medical degrees until 1874. Previously, even though the institute could run courses in medicine, the right to confer medical degrees was almost exclusively that of Uppsala University. Following on from this change in the institute's status the first doctoral thesis was defended at KI by Alfred Levertin, on the subject of "Om Torpa Källa". Just shortly thereafter the Medical Students' Union was formed.

The next decade was one of firsts. By 1880 the Karolinska Institute had started to accept women and so it was in 1884 that [[Karolina Widerström]] became the first woman to obtain a bachelor's degree in medicine from the institute; she later went on to obtain a Licentiate degree in medicine and chose to specialise in women's medicine and gynaecology. [[Anna Stecksén]] later became the first woman to obtain a doctorate from the university.

Just five years later, following the death of [[Alfred Nobel]] in 1895, the Karolinska Institute received the right to select the recipient of the [[Nobel Prize]] in Physiology or Medicine. Since then, this assignment has given the Karolinska Institute a broad contact network in the field of medical science. Indeed, over the years, five of the institute's own researchers have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

===20th century ===
[[File:Karolinska February 2013 03.jpg|thumb|KI Campus in [[Solna]]. [[Karolinska University Hospital]] is seen in the background.]]
By 1930 the Swedish parliament had decided that a new teaching hospital was needed and resolved to build the new facility at Norrbacka in the [[Solna]] area of Stockholm. The hospital was, from the start, planned to have its theoretical and practical functions side by side, essentially signalling the start of the KI's move to the new site. The chief architect appointed to design the building, later to be named the Karolinska Hospital after a proposal by the Karolinska Institute, was [[Carl Westman]]. Westman worked tirelessly on this project, allowing for completion of the main hospital building by 1940. The hospital was officially opened in the same year along with the new Department of Public Health, KI's first building co-located with the hospital complex, and by 1945 KI moved the last of its departments from Kungsholmen to the Norrbacka site, known to current students and staff as the institute's Solna Campus.

The Karolinska Institute was initially slow to adopt social change. Nanna Svartz became the Karolinska Institute and  Sweden's first state-employed female professor in 1937; she was the only female academic of this rank until Astrid Fagréus became the institute's second female professor almost thirty years later in 1965. However, by the mid-twentieth century student revolts were taking place regularly in the pursuit of greater social equality. It was in response to the largest of these revolts in 1968 that the name of the institute was shortened to the current form ''Karolinska Institutet'', or ''KI''.

[[File:John's University (5540460707) (2).jpg|left|thumb|Campus in [[Huddinge]]]]
By the early 1970s the Huddinge Hospital became increasingly affiliated with the institute and, as more and more of the Karolinska Institute's departments start to move into the hospital buildings, the area developed to become what is KI's Huddinge campus today. It was here that the medical information centre for computer-based citation research (MIC) was set up, making the Karolinska Institute the first [[MEDLARS]] (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System) Centre outside the United States. Similarly innovative work continued at the institute throughout the 1970s, with Sweden's first [[toxicology]] programme commencing at KI in 1976 and the establishment of a [[psychotherapy]] course in 1979. Furthermore, in 1977 the Stockholm Institute of Physiotherapy closed, with the study programme transferring to a new [[physiotherapy]] department at KI.

[[File:Karolinska institutet juni 2013.jpeg|thumb|The institute's campus in Solna]]
In 1982 the Huddinge campus was expanded with the addition of the Novum Research Centre for the study of [[biotechnology]], oral biology, nutrition and toxicology, and [[structural biology|structural biochemistry]]. The number of departments was reduced from 150 to 30 in 1993 and programmes in optometry, biomedicine, and dental technology commenced. The other key feature of the 1990s was the institute's increasingly ambitious plans for commercialisation, as a result of which 'Karolinska Institutet Holding AB' and 'Karolinska Innovations AB' were formed to help the institute intensify its relations with the business community and facilitate scientists' attempts to commercialise their discoveries.

The year 1997 marked a major point in the history of the Karolinska Institute as it was finally granted official university status with a stated mission to "contribute to the improvement of human health through research, education and information". This newly acquired status later led to the incorporation of the Stockholm University of Health Sciences into KI, as a result of which seven new study programmes in occupational therapy, audionomy, midwifery, biomedical laboratory science, nursing, radiology nursing and dental hygiene, were added to KI's teaching portfolio. Around the same time the institute's public health science programme commenced bringing the total number of study programmes to nineteen. Similarly, by this point the institute possessed three student unions: The Medical Students' Union, the Dental Students' Union, and the Physiotherapy Students' Union.

===21st century ===
[[File:Aula Medica, Karolinska Institutet (8960275188).jpg|thumb|The Karolinska Institute's new lecture hall complex, Aula Medica]]

With the turn of the millennium the Karolinska Institute sought to strengthen its activities in the field of external education and research, forming dedicated companies to help it do so and later establishing a fundraising campaign with a target of raising an extra 1 billion kronor for research between 2007 and 2010. During the same period new programmes were established in [[medical informatics]], [[podiatry]], and [[psychology]] as well as master's programmes of one and two years duration, and in 2004, the Karolinska Institute appointed its first female president – Harriet Wallberg-Henriksson, professor of integrative physiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ki.se/en/about/ki-through-the-centuries|title=KI through the centuries|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 2010 marked yet another significant event in the history of the KI as the institute celebrated its 200th anniversary under the patronage of King [[Carl XVI Gustaf]]. Shortly thereafter, in 2013, Anders Hamsten assumed his new position as vice-chancellor of the Karolinska Institute, a position he held until when he resigned as in the wake of the [[Paolo Macchiarini#Allegations of research misconduct|Macchiarini affair]].&lt;ref name="Hamsten_resignation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anders Hamsten steps down as Vice-Chancellor of Karolinska Institutet|url=http://ki.se/en/news/anders-hamsten-steps-down-as-vice-chancellor-of-karolinska-institutet|website=Karolinska Institutet|accessdate=13 February 2016|date=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''1967''' [[Ragnar Granit]] receives the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his contributions to the analysis of retinal function and how optical nerve cells respond to light stimuli, colour and frequency. 
*'''1970''' [[Ulf von Euler]] receives the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his contributions for discoveries concerning the humoral transmittors in the nerve terminals and the mechanism for their storage, release and inactivation. 
*'''1982''' [[Sune Bergström]] and [[Bengt Samuelsson]] jointly receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries concerning [[prostaglandins]] and related biologically active substances.
*'''1981''' [[Torsten Wiesel]] and [[ David H. Hubel]] jointly receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries concerning information processing in the [[visual system]].

==Seal's symbolism==

===Rod of Asclepius===
[[File:Karolinska Institutet seal.svg|right|200px]]
The rod of Asclepius is named after the god of medicine, [[Aesculapius]] or Asclepius. This ancient god was the son of Apollo and was generally accompanied by a snake. Over time, the snake became coiled around the staff borne by the god.

===Snake bowl===

The snake bowl was originally depicted together with Asclepius' daughter, the virgin goddess of health [[Hygieia]] or Hygiea. The snake ate from her bowl, which was considered to bring good fortune. There is nothing to support the notion that the snake would secrete its venom into the bowl.

===Cockerel===

The [[cockerel]] symbolises new life and was sacrificed to Asclepius by those who had recovered from illness. This is the meaning behind the Greek philosopher [[Socrates]]' last words after he drank the poisoned cup: "Crito, we owe a cock to Asclepius. Do pay it. Don't forget."

==Education==
[[File:Medicinska Föreningen i Solna 20060723.jpg|250px|thumb|Building of the Medical Students' Union ''Medicinska Föreningen'']]
The Karolinska Institute offers the widest range of medical education under one roof in Sweden. Several of the programmes include clinical training or other training within the healthcare system. The close proximity of the Karolinska University Hospital and other teaching hospitals in the Stockholm area thus plays an important role during the education.
Approximately 6,000 full-time students are taking educational and single subject courses at Bachelor and Master levels at the Karolinska Institute. Annually, 20 upper high school students from all over Sweden get selected to attend Karolinska's 7-week long biomedical summer research school, informally named "SoFo".

=== Hong Kong donation controversy ===
In February 2015, the KI announced it had received a record $50 million donation from Lau Ming-wai, who chairs Hong Kong property developer [[Chinese Estates Holdings]], and would establish a research centre in the city. Within a few days, ''[[Next Magazine (Chinese magazine)|Next Magazine]]'' revealed that Chuen-yan &amp;ndash; son of Hong Kong Chief Executive [[CY Leung]] &amp;ndash; had recently been awarded a fellowship to research heart disease therapeutics at the institute in Stockholm beginning that year, and raised questions about the "intricate relationship between the chief executive and powerful individuals". CY Leung had visited KI when in Sweden in 2014, and subsequently introduced KI president, Anders Hamsten, to Lau.&lt;ref name=universityworldnews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=2015021809361212|title=Karolinska's Asia campus donation questioned - University World News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=4&amp;art_id=154377&amp;sid=43908462&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20150217&amp;fc=4 "CY denies link over son's job and $400m donation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226092553/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=4&amp;art_id=154377&amp;sid=43908462&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20150217&amp;fc=4 |date=26 February 2015 }}. ''The Standard'', 17 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] urged the [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (Hong Kong)|ICAC]] to investigate the donation, suggesting that Leung may have abused his public position to further his son's career. The Chief Executive's Office strenuously denied suggestions of any quid pro quo, saying that "the admission of the [Chief Executive's] son to post-doctoral research at KI is an independent decision by KI having regard to his professional standards. He [the son] plays no role and does not hold any position at the [proposed] Ming Wai Lau Center for Regenerative Medicine."&lt;ref name=universityworldnews/&gt; This accusation has also been questioned by the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'''s Canadian-based pro-Beijing and pro-government opinion columnist, Alex Lo: "The insinuation is that Leung Chuen-yan with a doctorate from Cambridge doesn't deserve his job at the Karolinska Institute...Leung the son probably could get similar junior posts in many other prestigious-sounding – at least to brand-obsessed Hongkongers – research institutes; it's not that big a deal."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/technology/article/1720569/next-magazine-misses-mark-saying-money-influence-behind-leung "Next Magazine misses the mark in saying money, influence behind Leung Chuen-yan getting post at Karolinska Institute"].

==Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute==
[[File:Nobel PressConf GKHansen NTNU1147 (15773258580) (2).jpg|250px|thumb|Press Conference for the Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine 2014, held at the Karolinska Institute]]
{{main article|Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute}}
The Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute is a body at the Karolinska Institute which awards the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The Nobel Assembly consists of fifty professors in medical subjects at the Karolinska Institute, appointed by the faculty of the Institute, and is a private organisation which is formally not part of the Karolinska Institute. The main work involved in collecting nominations and screening nominees is performed by the Nobel Committee at the Karolinska Institute, which has five members. The Nobel Committee, which is appointed by the Nobel Assembly, is only empowered to recommend laureates, while the final decision rests with the Nobel Assembly.

In the early history of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, which was first awarded in 1901, the laurates were decided upon by the entire faculty of the Karolinska Institute. The reason for creating a special body for the decisions concerning the Nobel Prize was the fact that the Karolinska Institute is a state-run university, which in turn means that it is subject to various laws that apply to government agencies in Sweden and similar Swedish public sector organisations, such as freedom of information legislation. By moving the actual decision making to a private body at Karolinska Institute (but not part of it), it is possible to follow the regulations for the Nobel Prize set down by the Nobel Foundation, including keeping the confidentiality of all documents and proceedings for a minimum of 50 years. Also, the legal possibility of contesting the decisions in e.g. administrative courts is removed.

The other two Nobel Prize-awarding bodies in Sweden, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Swedish Academy, are legally private organisations (although enjoying royal patronage), and have therefore not had to make any special arrangements to be able to follow the Nobel Foundation's regulations.

==Biography==

===Political career===
Mayila was born at [[Boungounga]], located in [[Ngounie Province]].&lt;ref name=HD/&gt;&lt;ref name=Elites/&gt; In 1973, he became an official at the [[Shell Gabon]] oil company in charge of training and recruitment; he was also appointed as Secretary-General of Civil and Commercial Aviation in the same year. He then became Director of the National School of Administration in 1974, and at the end of 1974 he became Deputy Personal Adviser to the [[President of Gabon]], [[Omar Bongo]].&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;[http://www.louisgastonmayila.com/ma-biographie/ Biographical page at Mayila website] {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently he was appointed as Director of the Cabinet of the President of the Republic in 1975. While retaining that post, he obtained the rank of Minister in 1976 and was assigned responsibility for posts and telecommunications; he was also placed in charge of relations with the National Timber Company of Gabon (''Société Nationale des Bois du Gabon'', SNBG).&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; He held the position of Minister of Postal Services, Reform and Semi-Public Firms, Tourism, and National Parks until being dismissed from the government on 4 February 1978.&lt;ref&gt;"Mar 1978 - Government Reorganization", ''Keesing's Record of World Events'', volume 24, March 1978, Gabon, page 28,903.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayila was Secretary-General of the Government with the rank of Minister in 1980; subsequently he was Minister of National Education from late 1980 to 1987. He was then Minister of Labor, Employment, Human Resources, and Professional Training from 1987 to 1989, Minister of State for Labor, Employment, and Professional Training from 1989 to 1990, and Personal Adviser to the President of the Republic for Development and Public Investments from 1990 to 1992.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

In 1992, Mayila resigned from his post as Personal Adviser to the President and founded a new party, the [[People's Unity Party (Gabon)|People's Unity Party]] (''Parti de l'Unité du Peuple'', PUP).&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; However, his new party allied with the ruling [[Gabonese Democratic Party]] (PDG) and supported President Bongo's candidacy in the [[Gabonese presidential election, 1993|1993 presidential election]].&lt;ref name=HD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Okouma M'Engandzi, [http://www.agpgabon.ga/show_article.php?IDActu=7308 "Politique : La majorité présidentielle une structure à renouveler"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721025952/http://www.agpgabon.ga/show_article.php?IDActu=7308 |date=2011-07-21 }}, Agence Gabonaise de Presse, 6 April 2010 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mayila participated in the negotiations that led to the signing of the Paris Accords between the government and the opposition in 1994 and was then appointed as Minister-Delegate under the Prime Minister in charge of Decentralization and Mobile Security. He was subsequently promoted to the post of Minister of the Interior, Decentralization, and Mobile Security in early 1995.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

Mayila became President of the [[Economic and Social Council (Gabon)|Economic and Social Council]] (CES) in early 1997, and he rejoined the PDG in 2005. He was given the position of Vice-President of the PDG.&lt;ref name=Depart&gt;[http://www.izf.net/pages/gabon2007sauv/16099/ "Gabon: Le Vice-président du Parti démocratique gabonais (PDG) a annoncé son départ de la formation du président gabonais et la création de son propre mouvement, qui restera au sein de la majorité présidentielle"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108182138/http://www.izf.net/pages/gabon2007sauv/16099/ |date=2009-01-08 }}, AFP, 16 July 2007 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the [[Gabonese presidential election, 2005|November 2005 presidential election]], he worked on Bongo's re-election campaign as President of the Commission for Gabonese Abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bdpgabon.org/archives/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=2354 "L'etat-major du candidat Bongo Ondimba désormais connu"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716122812/http://www.bdpgabon.org/archives/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=2354 |date=2011-07-16 }}, ''L'Union'', 13 October 2005 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2006, he was appointed to the government as Deputy Prime Minister for Social Affairs and left his post at the CES.&lt;ref name=Depart/&gt;

Mayila supported some independent candidates at the time of the [[Gabonese legislative election, 2006|December 2006 parliamentary election]], although none of them were successful; he did not personally stand as a candidate. Feeling marginalized within the PDG,&lt;ref name=Depart/&gt; he threatened to quit in order to create a new party. On 28 February 2007, PDG Secretary-General [[Simplice Nguédet Manzéla]] publicly called on Mayila to abandon his threat and respect [[party discipline]] by discussing his complaints strictly within the party's internal structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.allafrica.com/stories/200703011043.html "Le secrétaire général du PDG demande à son "camarade" Mayila de réviser sa position"], Gabonews, 1 March 2007 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 July 2007, Mayila announced the formation of a new party, the UPRN, which was intended to be part of the Presidential Majority coalition of parties supporting President Bongo.&lt;ref name=Depart/&gt; Bongo promptly dismissed Mayila from the government in a decree issued on the same day,&lt;ref name=Depart/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Gabonese leader sacks deputy premier", Radio France Internationale, 18 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; appointing [[Jean-François Ndongou]] to take over his portfolio.&lt;ref name=Depart/&gt;

Mayila, still awaiting the legalization of the UPRN, met with Bongo on 3 October 2007 to explain the difficulties his new party was experiencing and "to resolve misunderstandings".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaboneco.com/show_article.php?IDActu=2406 "Gabon : Maître Louis Gaston Mayila chez Bongo Ondimba"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103021105/http://gaboneco.com/show_article.php?IDActu=2406 |date=2010-01-03 }}, GabonEco, 4 October 2007 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 January 2008, Mayila held a press conference to announce that the party had been legally recognized and would therefore participate in the [[Gabonese local elections, 2008|April 2008 local elections]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaboneco.com/show_article.php?IDActu=4577 "Gabon : Légalisée, l’UPNR attend de pied ferme les élections locales"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104024616/http://gaboneco.com/show_article.php?IDActu=4577 |date=2010-01-04 }}, GabonEco, 14 January 2008 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayila remained supportive of Bongo following his dismissal from the government; in his office, he kept a photograph of himself whispering into Bongo's ear. Speaking to the [[Associated Press]] in March 2008, he said that Gabon was "neither dictatorship nor democracy, neither paradise nor hell. We are something in between." While acknowledging the country's problems&amp;mdash;"no roads, not enough schools, too much unemployment"&amp;mdash;he stressed that Gabonese would "fix things on our own time, in our own way&amp;mdash;peacefully&amp;mdash;not through war."&lt;ref&gt;Todd Pitman, [https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-03-22-2756445433_x.htm "After Castro, African is longest-ruling"], Associated Press, 22 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Omar Bongo died in June 2009. As the President of the UPRN, Mayila backed opposition candidate [[Pierre Mamboundou]] for the [[Gabonese presidential election, 2009|30 August 2009 presidential election]]; the UPRN was one of several parties to support Mamboundou in an effort to unite behind a single opposition candidate. Immediately following the coalition's selection of Mamboundou, Mayila told the press on 21 July 2009: "You have asked for a single candidate for the opposition ... I offer you hope, I offer you a new way for Gabon."&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Lawson, [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601116&amp;sid=acfAe2e6YVpI "Gabon Opposition Coalition Picks Mamboundou to Seek Presidency"], Bloomberg.com, 21 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the election, Mayila held a press conference on 31 August 2009 in which he claimed that Mamboundou had won the election with 39.15% of the vote. The other two main candidates, [[Ali-Ben Bongo]] and [[André Mba Obame]], also claimed victory, but Mayila said that the figures he provided, which included a breakdown of votes from each province, "demonstrate[d] clearly" that Mamboundou was the winner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaboneco.com/show_article.php?IDActu=14768 "Gabon : Louis Gaston Mayila, «qu'Ali ne commette pas la folie de se déclarer vainqueur»"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903082352/http://gaboneco.com/show_article.php?IDActu=14768 |date=2009-09-03 }}, GabonEco, 31 August 2009 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business career===
Aside from politics, Mayila has also served as president of numerous companies, notably national airlines. He has been the President of Air Inter Gabon, COFMA (''Compagnie Forestière de Tsamba Magotsi''), AGAR, and [[Air Gabon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infosplusgabon.com/article.php3?id_article=144|title=Me Louis Gaston Mayila|publisher=Info Plus Gabon|date=February 6, 2006|accessdate=August 27, 2009|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Labor|sp=us}}
The '''proletariat''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|r|oʊ|l|ɪ|ˈ|t|ɛər|i|ə|t}} from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|proletarius}} "producing offspring") is the [[Social class|class]] of [[Wage labor|wage-earner]]s in an economic society whose only possession of significant material value is their [[labour-power]] (how much work they can do).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/proletariat proletariat]. Accessed: 6 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A member of such a class is a '''proletarian'''.

In [[Marxist theory]], a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] is for the proletariat, of the proletariat, and by the proletariat. On the Marxist view, this will endow the proletarian with the power to abolish the conditions that make a person a proletarian and, thus, build [[communism]].

== {{lang|la|Proletarii}} of the Roman Republic ==
{{See|Constitution of the Roman Republic}}
The {{lang|la|proletarii}} constituted a [[social class in ancient Rome|social class of Roman citizens]] owning little or no property. The origin of the name is presumably linked with the [[census]], which Roman authorities conducted every five years to produce a register of citizens and their property from which their military duties and voting privileges could be determined. For citizens with property valued 11,000 {{lang|la|[[as (Roman coin)|assēs]]}} or less, which was below the lowest census for military service, their children—{{lang|la|proles}} (from Latin {{lang|la|prōlēs}}, "offspring")—were listed instead of their property; hence, the name {{lang|la|proletarius}}, "the one who produces offspring". The only contribution of a {{lang|la|proletarius}} to the Roman society was seen in his ability to raise children, the future Roman citizens who can colonize new territories conquered by the [[Roman Republic]] and later by the [[Roman Empire]]. The citizens who had no property of significance were called {{lang|la|[[capite censi]]}} because they were "persons registered not as to their property...but simply as to their existence as living individuals, primarily as heads ({{lang|la|caput}}) of a family."&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Berger, ''Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law'' (Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society 1953) at 380; 657.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold J. Toynbee]], especially in his ''[[A Study of History]]'', uses the word "proletariat" in this general sense of people without property or a stake in society. Toynbee focuses particularly on the generative spiritual life of the "internal proletariat" (those living within a given civil society). He also describes the "heroic" folk legends of the "external proletariat" (poorer groups living outside the borders of a civilization). Compare Toynbee, ''A Study of History'' (Oxford University 1934–1961), 12 volumes, in Volume V ''Disintegration of Civilizations, part one'' (1939) at 58–194 (internal proletariat), and at 194–337 (external proletariat).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Working man-obrero 2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A [[manual labor]]er at work in [[Venezuela]]. Manual laborers are generally considered to be part of the proletariat.]]
Although included in one of the five support {{lang|la|[[centuria]]e}} of the {{lang|la|Comitia Centuriata}} (English: [[Centuriate Assembly]]), {{lang|la|proletarii}} were largely deprived of their voting rights due to their low social status caused by their lack of "even the minimum property required for the lowest class"&lt;ref&gt;Berger, ''Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law'' (1953) at 351; 657 (quote).&lt;/ref&gt; and a class-based hierarchy of the {{lang|la|Comitia Centuriata}}. The late Roman historians, such as [[Livy]], not without some uncertainty, understood the {{lang|la|Comitia Centuriata}} to be one of three forms of popular assembly of early Rome composed of {{lang|la|centuriae}}, the voting units whose members represented a class of citizens according to the value of their property. This assembly, which usually met on the {{lang|la|[[Campus Martius]]|italic=no}} to discuss public policy issues, was also used as a means of designating military duties demanded of Roman citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Titus Livius ({{circa|59 BC}} – AD 17), ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1, 43; the first five books translated by Aubrey de Sélincourt as Livy, ''The Early History of Rome'' (Penguin 1960, 1971) at 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; One of reconstructions of the {{lang|la|Comitia Centuriata}} features 18 {{lang|la|centuriae}} of cavalry, and 170 {{lang|la|centuriae}} of infantry divided into five classes by wealth, plus 5 {{lang|la|centuriae}} of support personnel called {{lang|la|[[adsidui]]}}. The top infantry class assembled with full arms and armor; the next two classes brought arms and armor, but less and lesser; the fourth class only spears; the fifth slings. In voting, the cavalry and top infantry class were enough to decide an issue; as voting started at the top, an issue might be decided before the lower classes voted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Lintott]], ''The Constitution of the Roman Republic'' (Oxford University 1999) at 55–61, re the {{lang|la|Comitia Centuriata}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the last centuries of the [[Roman Republic]] (509–44 BC), the {{lang|la|Comitia Centuriata}} became impotent as a political body, which further eroded already minuscule political power the {{lang|la|proletarii}} might have had in the Roman society.

Following a series of wars the Roman Republic engaged since the closing of the [[Second Punic War]] (218–201 BC), such as the [[Jugurthine War]] and conflicts in Macedonia and Asia, the significant reduction in the number of Roman family farmers had resulted in the shortage of people whose property qualified them to perform the citizenry's [[political history of the Roman military|military duty to Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf., [[Theodor Mommsen]], {{lang|de|[[History of Rome (Mommsen)|Römisches Geschichte]]|italic=yes}} (1854–1856), 3 volumes; translated as ''History of Rome'' (1862–1866), 4 volumes; reprint (The Free Press 1957) at vol. III: 48–55 (Mommsen's Bk. III, ch. XI toward end).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the [[Marian reforms]] initiated in 107 BC by the Roman general [[Gaius Marius]] (157–86), the {{lang|la|proletarii}} became the backbone of the [[Roman army]].&lt;ref&gt;H. H. Scullard, ''Gracchi to Nero. A History of Rome from 133 BC to AD 68'' (London: Methuen 1959, 4th ed. 1976) at 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Marx]], who studied [[Roman law]] at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf., [[Sidney Hook]], ''Marx and the Marxists'' (Princeton: Van Nostrand 1955) at 13.&lt;/ref&gt; used the term ''proletariat'' in his socio-political theory of [[Marxism]] to describe a [[working class]] unadulterated by [[private property]] and capable of a revolutionary action to topple [[capitalism]] in order to create [[classless society]]. Marx most likely encountered the term while studying the works of the liberal economist and historian {{lang|fr|[[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi]]|italic=no}}, who was the first to apply it to the working class created under capitalism, and whose writings were frequently cited by Marx.&lt;ref name="Ekins"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ekins |first1=Paul |last2=Max-Neef |first2=Manfred |title=Real Life Economics |date=2006 |publisher=Routledge |pages=91-93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ekelund Jr |first1=Robert B. |last2=Hébert |first2=Robert F. |title=A History of Economic Theory and Method: Fifth Edition |date=2006 |publisher=Waveland Press |page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lutz"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lutz |first1=Mark A. |title=Economics for the Common Good: Two Centuries of Economic Thought in the Humanist Tradition |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |pages=55-57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gareth"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stedman Jones |first1=Gareth |editor1-last=Aprile |editor1-first=Sylvie |editor2-last=Bensimon |editor2-first=Fabrice |title=La France et l’Angleterre au XIXe siècle.

==Marxist theory==
{{Marxism |Concepts}}
In [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory, the proletariat is the [[social class]] that does not have ownership of the [[means of production]] and whose only means of subsistence is to sell their [[labor power]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marx|first=Karl|title=Das Kapital, Kritik der politischen Ökonomie|trans-title=Capital: Critique of Political Economy|year=1887|publisher=Progress Publishers|location=Moscow|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch06.htm|authorlink=Karl Marx|editor=Frederick Engels|accessdate=10 February 2013|chapter=Chapter Six: The Buying and Selling of Labour-Power}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a [[wage]] or [[salary]]. Proletarians are wage-workers, while some refer to those who receive salaries as the ''salariat''. For [[Marx]], however, wage labor may involve getting a salary rather than a wage ''per se''. Marxism sees the proletariat and [[bourgeoisie]] (capitalist class) as occupying conflicting positions, since workers automatically wish their wages to be as high as possible, while owners and their proxies wish for wages (costs) to be as low as possible.

[[File:Pyramid of Capitalist System.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A 1911 ''[[Industrial Worker]]'' publication advocating industrial unionism based on a critique of capitalism. The proletariat "work for all" and "feed all".]]
In Marxist theory, the borders between the proletariat and some layers of the [[petite bourgeoisie]], who rely primarily but not exclusively on self-employment at an income no different from an ordinary wage or below it – and the [[lumpenproletariat]], who are not in legal employment – are not necessarily well defined. Intermediate positions are possible, where some wage-labor for an employer combines with self-employment. Marx makes a clear distinction between proletariat as salaried workers, which he sees as a progressive class, and [[Lumpenproletariat]], "rag-proletariat", the poorest and outcasts of the society, such as beggars, tricksters, entertainers, buskers, criminals and prostitutes, which he considers a retrograde class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9049344/Lumpenproletariat Lumpen proletariat –  Britannica Online Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marx|first=Karl|title=Manifesto of the Communist Party|date=February 1848|publisher=Progress Publishers|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm|accessdate=10 February 2013|chapter=Bourgeois and Proletarians}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socialism|Socialist]] parties have often struggled over the question of whether they should seek to organize and represent all the lower classes, or just the wage-earning proletariat.

According to Marxism, [[capitalism]] is a system based on the [[Exploitation of labor|exploitation]] of the proletariat by the bourgeoisie. This exploitation takes place as follows: the workers, who own no [[means of production]] of their own, must use the means of production that are property of others in order to produce, and consequently earn, their living. Instead of hiring those means of production, they themselves get hired by capitalists and work for them, producing goods or services. These goods or services become the property of the capitalist, who sells them at the market.

One part of the wealth produced is used to pay the workers' wages (variable costs), another part to renew the means of production (constant costs) while the third part, [[surplus value]] is split between the capitalist's private takings (profit), and the money used to pay rents, taxes, interests, etc. Surplus value is the difference between the wealth that the proletariat produces through its work, and the wealth it consumes to survive and to provide labor to the capitalist companies.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. The Capital, volume 1, chapter 6. http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch06.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A part of the surplus value is used to renew or increase the means of production, either in quantity or quality (i.e., it is turned into [[Capital (economics)|capital]]), and is called capitalized surplus value.&lt;ref&gt;Luxemburg, Rosa. [[The Accumulation of Capital]]. Chapter 6, Enlarged Reproduction, http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1913/accumulation-capital/ch06.htm&lt;/ref&gt; What remains is consumed by the capitalist class.

The commodities that proletarians produce and capitalists sell are valued for the amount of [[labor (economics)|labor]] embodied in them. The same goes for the workers' [[labor power]] itself: it is valued, not for the amount of wealth it produces, but for the amount of labor necessary to produce and reproduce it. Thus the capitalists earn wealth from the labor of their employees, not as a function of their personal contribution to the productive process, which may even be null, but as a function of the juridical relation of property to the means of production. Marxists argue that new wealth is created through labor applied to [[natural resource]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. [[Critique of the Gotha Programme]], I. http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx argued that the proletariat would displace the capitalist system with the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], abolishing the social relationships underpinning the class system and then developing into a [[communist]] society in which "the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all".&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. [[The Communist Manifesto]], part II, Proletarians and Communists http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prole drift==
Prole drift, short for proletarian drift, is the tendency in advanced industrialized societies for everything inexorably to become proletarianized, or to become commonplace and commodified. This trend is attributed to mass production, mass selling, mass communication and mass education. Examples include best-seller lists, films and music that must appeal to the masses, and shopping malls.&lt;ref name="class"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fussell|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Fussell|title=Class, A Guide Through the American Status System|publisher=Ballantine|date=October 1992|location=New York|isbn=978-0-345-31816-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aPbF1kuayJYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FMIB 33966 Removing Blubber from Whale Beached on California Coast.jpeg|thumb|Rendering a beached whale in California]]
'''Rendering''' is a process that converts waste animal [[biological tissue|tissue]] into stable, usable materials. Rendering can refer to any processing of [[animal product]]s into more useful materials, or, more narrowly, to the rendering of whole animal fatty tissue into purified fats like [[lard]] or [[tallow]]. Rendering can be carried out on an industrial, farm, or kitchen [[Scalability|scale]].

The majority of tissue processed comes from [[slaughterhouse]]s, but also includes restaurant grease and butcher shop trimmings and expired meat from grocery stores. This material can include the [[fat]]ty tissue, bones, and [[offal]], as well as entire carcasses of animals condemned at slaughterhouses, and those that have died on farms, in transit, etc. The most common animal sources are [[beef]], [[pork]], [[sheep]], and [[poultry]].

The rendering process simultaneously dries the material and separates the fat from the [[bone]] and [[protein]]. A rendering process yields a fat [[commodity]] ([[yellow grease]], choice white grease, bleachable fancy [[tallow]], etc.) and a protein meal ([[meat and bone meal]], poultry byproduct meal, etc.).

Rendering plants often also handle other materials, such as slaughterhouse [[blood]], [[feather]]s and [[hair]], but do so using processes distinct from true rendering.

The occupation of renderer has appeared in "dirtiest jobs" lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/dirtiest-jobs/story?id=17130057#2 |title=The Seven Dirtiest Jobs |website=ABC News |date=Sep 3, 2012 |accessdate=29 January 2014 |author=Ellin, Abby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process variations==
The rendering process varies in a number of ways:
* Whether the end products are used as human or animal food depends on the quality of input material and the processing methods and equipment.
* The material may be processed by wet or dry means. In wet processing, either boiling water or steam is added to the material, separating fat into a floating phase. In dry processing, fat is released by dehydrating the raw material.
* The temperature range used may be high or low.
* Rendering may be done either in discrete batches or in a continuous process.
* The processing plant may be operated by an independent company that buys input material from suppliers, or by a packing plant that produces the material in-house.

==Rendering processes for edible products==
Edible rendering processes are basically meat processing operations and produce [[lard]] or edible [[tallow]] for use in food products. Edible rendering is generally carried out in a continuous process at low temperature (less than the boiling point of water). The process usually consists of finely chopping the edible fat materials (generally fat trimmings from meat cuts), heating them with or without added steam, and then carrying out two or more stages of [[centrifugal separation]]. The first stage separates the liquid water and fat mixture from the solids. The second stage further separates the fat from the water. The solids may be used in food products, pet foods, etc., depending on the original materials. The separated fat may be used in food products, or if in surplus, may be diverted to soap making operations. Most edible rendering is done by meat packing or processing companies.

One edible product is [[Greaves (food)|greaves]], which is the unmeltable residue left after animal fat has been rendered.

An alternative process cooks slaughterhouse [[offal]] to produce a thick, lumpy "stew" for the pet food industry, which uses it principally in tinned [[Cat food|cat]] and [[dog food]]s. Such plants are notable for the offensive odour that they can produce, and are often located well away from human habitation.

==Rendering processes for inedible products==
Materials that for aesthetic or sanitary reasons are not suitable for human food are the feedstocks for inedible rendering processes. Much of the inedible raw material is rendered using the "dry" method. This may be a batch or a continuous process in which the material is heated in a steam-jacketed vessel to drive off the moisture and simultaneously release the fat from the fat cells. The material is first ground, then heated to release the fat and drive off the moisture, percolated to drain off the free fat, and then more fat is pressed out of the solids, which at this stage are called "cracklings" or "dry-rendered tankage". The cracklings are further ground to make meat and [[bone meal]].

A variation on a dry process involves finely chopping the material, fluidizing it with hot fat, and then evaporating the mixture in one or more evaporator stages. Some inedible rendering is done using a wet process, which is generally a continuous process similar in some ways to that used for edible materials. The material is heated with added steam and then pressed to remove a water-fat mixture that is then separated into fat, water, and fine solids by stages of centrifuging and/or evaporation. The solids from the press are dried and then ground into meat and bone meal. Most independent renderers process only inedible material.

==History==
The development of rendering was primarily responsible for the profitable utilization of meat industry by-products, which in turn allowed the development of a massive industrial-scale meat industry that made food more economical for the consumer.
Rendering has been carried out for many centuries, primarily for [[soap]] and [[candle]] making. The earliest rendering was done in a [[kettle]] over an open fire. This type of rendering is still done on farms to make lard (pork fat) for food purposes. With the development of steam boilers, it was possible to use steam-jacketed kettles to make a higher grade product, and reduce fire danger. A further development came in the 19th century with the use of steam digesters: a tank used as a pressure cooker where steam was injected into the material being rendered. This process is a wet rendering process called "tanking" and was used for edible and inedible products, although better grades of edible products were made using the open kettle process. After the material is tanked, the free fat is run off, the remaining water ("tank water") run into a separate vat, and the solids removed and dried by pressing and steam-drying in a jacketed vessel. The tank water was either run into a [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] or it was evaporated to make [[glue]] or protein concentrate to add to [[fertilizer]]. The solids were used for fertilizer.

[[Upton Sinclair]] wrote ''[[The Jungle]]'' (1906), an exposé on the Chicago meat processing industry which created public outrage. His work helped the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1907 which paved the way for the creation of the [[FDA]].

The pressure tank made possible the development of the [[Chicago]] meat industry in the United States, with its concentration in one geographic area, because it allowed the economic disposal of byproducts which would otherwise overwhelm the environment in that area. At first, small companies that sprang up near the packers did the rendering. Later the packers entered the rendering industry. [[Gustavus Swift]], [[Nelson Morris]], and [[Lucius Darling]] were among the early pioneers of the U.S. rendering industry with their personal backing and/or direct participation in the rendering industry.

Innovations came rapidly in the 20th century. Some of these were the uses for rendered products, and others were the rendering methods. In the 1920s, a batch dry rendering process was invented; the material was cooked in horizontal steam-jacketed cylinders (similar to the fertilizer dryers of the day). Advantages claimed for the dry process were economy of energy, better protein yield, faster processing, and fewer obnoxious odors. Over the years, the wet "tanking" process was replaced with the dry process. By the end of [[World War II]], most rendering installations used the dry process. In the 1960s, continuous dry processes were introduced, one using a variation of the conventional dry cooker and the other making use of a mincing and evaporation process to dry the material and yield the fat. In the 1980s, high energy costs popularized the various "wet" continuous processes. These processes were more energy efficient and allowed the re-use of process vapours to pre-heat or dry the materials during the process.

After [[WWII]], synthetic detergents arrived, which displaced soaps in domestic and industrial washing. In the early 1950s, over half of the inedible fat market vanished. Diversion in these materials into animal feeds soon replaced the lost soap market and eventually became the single largest use for inedible fats.

The widespread use of "boxed beef", where the beef was cut into consumer portions at packing plants rather than local butcher shops and markets, meant that fat and meat scraps for renderers stayed at the packing plants and were rendered there by packer renderers, rather than by the independent rendering companies.

The rejection of animal fats by diet-conscious consumers led to a surplus of edible fats, and the resultant diversion into soapmaking and [[oleochemical]]s, displacing inedible fats and contributing to the market volatility of this commodity.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The rendering industry is one of the oldest recycling industries, and made possible the development of a large food industry. The industry takes what would otherwise be waste materials and makes useful products such as fuels, soaps, rubber, plastics, etc. At the same time, rendering solves what would otherwise be a major disposal problem. As an example, the USA recycles more than 21 million metric tons annually of highly perishable and noxious organic matter. In 2004, the U.S. industry produced over 8 million metric tons of products, of which 1.6 million metric tons were exported.

Usually, materials used as raw materials in the rendering process are susceptible to spoilage. However, after rendering, the materials are much more resistant to spoiling. This is due to the application of heat either through cooking in the wet rendering process or the extraction of fluid in the dry rendering process. The fat obtained can be used as low-cost raw material in making grease, animal feed, soap, candles, [[biodiesel]], and as a feed-stock for the [[chemical]] industry. [[Tallow]], derived from beef waste, is an important raw material in the [[steel]] rolling industry providing the required lubrication when compressing steel sheets.

Meat and bones (in a dry, ground state) are converted to ''[[meat and bone meal]]''. Health professionals believe that meat and bone meal in animal feed was the main route for the late-20th century spread of [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (mad-cow disease, BSE), which is also fatal to human beings. Early in the 21st century, most countries tightened regulations to prevent this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?contentid=BSE_FAQs.xml |title=FAQ on BSE |website=United States Department of Agriculture |access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If not for the rendering industry, the cost of waste animal material would be high and would place a significant economic and environmental burden on areas involved in industrial scale slaughtering. This cost would manifest itself through the use of expensive sanitary landfills, incinerators, and other similar waste disposal techniques without yielding profit from [[opportunity costs]]. Alternatives to rendering products may not reduce cost.

==Kitchen rendering==
Rendering of fats is also carried out on a kitchen scale by [[chef]]s and home cooks. In the kitchen, rendering is used to transform [[butter]] into [[clarified butter]], [[suet]] into [[tallow]], [[pork]] fat into [[lard]], and chicken fat into [[schmaltz]].

In 2012 the company moved a second time, to Cambridge, Massachusetts. At the time, CEO Chris Garabedian indicated the move was motivated by the need to recruit expertise in [[rare disease]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Timmerman, Luke. [http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2012/09/07/sarepta-moves-from-seattle-to-boston-to-recruit-more-talent/ Sarepta Moves From Seattle to Boston for the Talent.] 7 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Corvallis laboratory facility was closed in 2016.

==Products==
Its primary products are [[Morpholino]] oligomers (PMOs), synthetic nucleic acid analogs that were conceived of by James Summerton and invented by Summerton with Dwight Weller, originally developed under the name NeuGene Antisense.  Since morpholino oligomers can form sequence-specific double-stranded complexes with RNA they are suitable use in [[antisense therapy]]. In one application, translation blocking, a morpholino oligomer binds to [[messenger RNA]] produced by a known disease-causing gene to prevent it from being [[gene translation|translated]] into protein. Morpholinos can also work as splice-switching olgos, targeting pre-mRNA to alter splicing and so causing changes in the structure of the mature mRNA (the mechanism of the approved drug eteplirsen).  Morpholinos have been tested for a wide range of applications including prevention of cardiac [[restenosis]] after [[angioplasty]], treatment of coronary artery bypass grafts, treatment of polycystic kidney disease, redirection of drug metabolism, treatment of some mutations causing [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy|Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)]], and inhibition of infectious diseases.  Their greatest clinical &amp; commercial success thus far has been in treatment of DMD. A new class of Morpholino oligos, the peptide-linked Morpholinos or PPMO, are linked to an arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptide to enhance their delivery into cells and have entered clinical trials&lt;ref&gt;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03375255&lt;/ref&gt;

The Morpholino drug [[eteplirsen]], targeting exon 51 of the [[dystrophin]] mRNA, has been approved as a human therapeutic by the FDA in 2016&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm521263.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and clinical trials for Morpholinos targeting other exons are ongoing.  Morpholinos have been used in preclinical studies to inhibit replication of a broad range of viruses, including [[influenza]], [[West Nile Virus]], [[SARS]], [[Hepatitis C]], [[dengue fever]], [[Ebola]] and [[Calicivirus]], all of which are single stranded [[RNA virus]]es.  They are in advanced development for prevention and treatment of Ebola and [[Marburg virus]]es.  In March 2013, the Company announced positive results from a non-human primate study of AVI-7288, the drug candidate for treatment of Marburg virus infection. The results showed that intramuscular administration of AVI-7288 resulted in survival rates up to 100 percent in monkeys exposed to this fatal virus.  These results are similar to those in previous studies when the drug was given by intravenous injection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.drugs.com/clinical_trials/sarepta-s-marburg-shows-survival-rates-after-intramuscular-delivery-non-human-primates-15214.html Sarepta's Marburg Drug Shows High Survival Rates After Intramuscular Delivery in Non-Human Primates.] Marketwire, 4 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to development of Morpholinos as therapeutics, AVI has conducted six human trials for [[colorectal]] and [[pancreatic]] cancers using their cancer [[vaccine]] [[AVICINE]].

Piñera's family moved to Belgium one year after his birth and later to [[New York City]], where his father was the Chilean ambassador to the United Nations.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Piñera returned to Chile in 1955 and enrolled in the [[Colegio del Verbo Divino]] ("Divine Word College"), from which he graduated in 1967.''&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} Universia [http://www.universia.cl/portada/actualidad/noticia_actualidad.jsp?noticia=120078 Sebastián Piñera Perfil] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207211052/http://www.universia.cl/portada/actualidad/noticia_actualidad.jsp?noticia=120078 |date=7 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;''

Piñera then matriculated at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]], from which he graduated in 1971 with an undergraduate degree in commercial engineering. Upon graduation, he was awarded the Raúl Iver Oxley Prize, which is given to the best overall student of each class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://diario.elmercurio.cl/detalle/index.asp?id=44b683ae-0698-4b29-a37e-54adbab1d7d3 |work=El Mercurio |title=Caminos cruzados |language=es}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Piñera continued on to [[Harvard University]] on a partial [[Fulbright Program]] for [[postgraduate studies]] in economics. During his time at Harvard, Piñera and a classmate coauthored an article, "The Old South's Stake in the Inter-Regional Movement of Slaves", for the ''Journal of Economic History''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kotlikoff |first=Laurence J. |last2=Piñera |first2=Sebastián |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Old South's Stake in the Inter-Regional Movement of Slaves, 1850–1860 |journal=Journal of Economic History |volume=37 |issue=2 |year=1977 |pages=434–450 |jstor=2118765 |doi=10.1017/s002205070009700x}}&lt;/ref&gt; After three years at Harvard, Piñera graduated with both an M.A. and Ph.D. in Economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://noticiassecretas.blogspot.com/2009/07/la-tesis-doctoral-de-sebastian-pinera.html |title=La tesis doctoral de Sebastián Piñera |date=30 July 2009 |first=Roberto Castillo |last=Sandoval |work=Noticias secretas |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teaching career ==
Piñera was an educator from 1971 until 1988. He was Professor of Economics at the [[University of Chile]], the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]], and [[Adolfo Ibáñez University]]. In 1971, he was professor of Economic Political Theory in the School of Economics at the University of Chile and in 1972, he was a professor at the Valparaiso Business School.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://biografias.bcn.cl/pags/biografias/detalle_par.php?id=226 |title=Sebastián Piñera Echeñique&amp;nbsp;— Senador |work=Reseñas parlamentarias&amp;nbsp;— Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional de Chile |date= |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundations ==
In 1989, with Cecilia Morel, Danica Radic, and Paula Délano, Piñera created the Enterprising Women Foundation (''Fundación Mujer Emprende''), originally called The House of Youth (''La Casa de la Juventud''). The foundation aims to assist in the development of young women of lower income.''&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} Fundacion Mujer Emprende [http://www.mujeremprende.cl/me_qs.php Quienes Somos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115140830/http://www.mujeremprende.cl/me_qs.php |date=15 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;''

In 1973, Piñera created the foundation ''Fundación Futuro'', of which he is president and whose directors are Cristián Boza D., María Teresa Chadwick P., Hugo Montes B., Cecilia Morel M., Renato Poblete S.J., and Fabio Valdés C.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The head director of the foundation is Magdalena Piñera.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.estrellaarica.cl/prontus4_nots/site/artic/20100423/pags/20100423170525.html|title=Magdalena Piñera, directora de la Fundación Futuro lanzó "Ojo con el Ejército de Chile" (Video)|website=www.estrellaarica.cl|access-date=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The foundation’s mission is to help in Chile’s development of justice, freedom and democracy.''&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} Fundanción Futuro [http://www.fundacionfuturo.cl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=43&amp;Itemid=20 Quienes Somos]&lt;/ref&gt;'' The foundation was renamed ''Fundación Cultura y Sociedad'' after Piñera was elected president.''&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} Terra [http://economia.terra.cl/noticias/noticia.aspx?idNoticia=201002091001_INV_78739381 Semana clave para fundación a la que Piñera traspasará propiedad de Chilevisión]&lt;/ref&gt;''

Under the ''Fundación Cultura y Sociedad'' (formerly ''Fundación Futuro''), the ''Grupo Tantauco'' has the mission of [[environmentalism]], and is administered by Juan Carlos Urquidi.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} It was created to support the proposals Piñera plans to institute during his presidency.''&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} Piñera2010 [http://pinera2010.cl/2009/09/22/conoce-las-propuestas-medioambientales-del-grupo-tantauco/ Conoce las propuestas medioambientales del Grupo Tantauco] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207222157/http://pinera2010.cl/2009/09/22/conoce-las-propuestas-medioambientales-del-grupo-tantauco/ |date=7 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;'' In 2005, Piñera created [[Tantauco Park]] (Spanish: ''Parque Tantauco''), a 1,180 km2 (456 sq mi) private natural reserve he bought and owns on the south end of Chiloé Island, in order to protect 118,000 hectares of the region's unique ecosystem. His foundation runs the park, which is open to the public and is an [[ecotourist]] location.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In fact, Piñera bought the 118,000 hectares in Chiloé through an [[offshore company]] in Panama. He has faced pressure to cede eight hectares to 16 indigenous families whose presence pre-dates Piñera's purchase and who have spent years negotiating to obtain title to their familial lands.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chile-landrights-island/mystical-islanders-divided-over-chiles-giant-bridge-project-idUSKCN1GD5JE&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elmostrador.cl/noticias/pais/2017/06/09/familias-que-viven-en-tantauco-presionan-a-pinera-para-que-entregue-hectareas-antes-de-las-primarias&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional project, ''Grupo Tantauco: Derechos Humanos'', was proposed in hopes of beginning a reconciliation between the Chilean people who suffered human rights violations during [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s dictatorship.''&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} Piñera2010 [http://www.pinera2010.cl/2008/12/05/este-miercoles-se-lanza-nuevo-grupo-tantauco-derechos-humanos/ Grupo Tantauco: Derechos Humanos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091116222334/http://pinera2010.cl/2008/12/05/este-miercoles-se-lanza-nuevo-grupo-tantauco-derechos-humanos/ |date=16 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;''

== Businesses ==
Piñera was general manager of the {{ill|Banco de Talca|es|Banco de Talca|WD=https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_de_Talca}}. In 1982, a warrant was issued for his arrest on charges of violating banking law. Piñera spent 24 days in hiding while his lawyers appealed the order. A [[writ of habeas corpus]], first rejected by the Appeals Court but then approved by the Supreme Court, acquitted Piñera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lnd.cl/prontus_noticias_v2/site/artic/20090418/pags/20090418205903.html|title=lnd.cl|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piñera has built an estimated fortune of [[United States dollar|$US]]2.8 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] {{as of|2018|02|lc=on}}, according to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Forbes Billionaires"&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/sebastian-pinera |title=Sebastian Pinera&amp;nbsp;— Forbes|work=Forbes: The World's Billionaires |date=27 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His wealth is greatly due to his involvement in introducing [[credit card]]s to Chile in the late 1970s and his subsequent investments, mainly in [[LAN Airlines]] stock. Piñera acquired shares of the formerly state-owned company from [[Scandinavian Airlines]] in 1994, as part of a joint venture with the Cueto family.&lt;ref name="Forbes Billionaires" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.lan.com/files/about_us/lanchile/memoria2007.pdf LAN Airlines 2007 annual report, p. 29]" ''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==
{{see also|Political positions of Sebastián Piñera}}
Piñera declared that he voted ''No'' in the [[Chilean national plebiscite, 1988|1988 plebiscite]] on whether [[Augusto Pinochet]] should stay in power until 1997 (even though it was a secret ballot).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} In 1988 as Pinochet had lost the referendum and Chile was [[Chilean transition to democracy|returning to democracy]] Piñera offered his support for the [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democrat]] [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]] in his pre-candidacy for president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diario.latercera.com/2011/01/22/01/contenido/opinion/11-56835-9-pinera-y-sus-raices-dc.shtml|title=La Tercera|author=COPESA, Consorcio Periodistico de Chile S.A.|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle was the son of former president [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]], who had together with Piñera's father founded the Christian Democrat Party of Chile and had been appointed ambassador by Frei Montalva.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} However, in 1989 Sebastián Piñera headed the presidential campaign of [[Hernán Büchi]], a former finance minister of the Pinochet government.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} During the same election process, Piñera was elected as Senator for East Santiago (1990–1998) and soon after, joined the center-right [[National Renewal (Chile)|National Renewal]] Party.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} During his term as Senator he was a member of the Senate Finance Committee.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In 1992, Piñera's attempt to become his party's candidate for the following year's [[Chilean presidential election, 1993|Presidential election]] dramatically ended after he was involved in a scandal known as Piñeragate, wherein a wiretapped conversation between himself and a friend was revealed during a political television show he attended.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} In the conversation—made public by the television station's owner, Ricardo Claro—he conspired to have his rival for the party's nomination, [[Evelyn Matthei]], cornered during the show by a journalist close to Piñera.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The tape was then revealed to have been illegally recorded by a member of the military and given to Matthei, who then gave it to Claro.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Matthei stepped down from the presidential race as well.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In 1998, Piñera opposed the [[Indictment and arrest of Augusto Pinochet|arrest and detention of Augusto Pinochet]], in London, initiated by [[Baltasar Garzón]], arguing that it was an attack on the sovereignty and dignity of [[Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.cl/pinera-y-su-acalorado-apoyo-a-pinochet-en-1998/noticias/2009-12-10/141341.html Piñera y su acalorado apoyo a Pinochet en 1998] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622063147/http://www.lanacion.cl/pinera-y-su-acalorado-apoyo-a-pinochet-en-1998/noticias/2009-12-10/141341.html |date=22 June 2011 }}. ''La Nación'', 10 de diciembre de 2009 (part of the speech can be seen at {{YouTube|TV-Ulfo09Bs}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Piñera was president of his party from 2001 to 2004.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} He tried to run for Senator in 2001, but resigned his campaign after the presidential candidate of his alliance -and member of the allied party, the [[Independent Democratic Union]] (UDI)-, [[Joaquín Lavín]] made it clear he would not support candidates from Piñera's party, insisting on supporting retired [[Admiral]] Jorge Arancibia instead.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

On 14 May 2005, in a surprise move Piñera announced his candidacy for the [[Chilean presidential election, 2005|2005 presidential election]] (RN was supposed to support UDI's Lavín.) He has described his political philosophy as [[Christian humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/01/12/internacional/1137096398.html|title= Sebastián Piñera: la nueva derecha que se desprende de la dictadura|trans-title= Sebastián Piñera: the new right that sets apart from the dictatorship|language= Spanish|author= |date= 16 January 2006|publisher= El Mundo|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first round of the election, on 11 December, he obtained 25.4% of the vote, which placed him in second place.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Since no candidate achieved an [[absolute majority]], a [[Two-round system|runoff election]] was held on 15 January 2006, between himself and  of the governing coalition.

On 5 February, Piñera confirmed plans to sell his 26.3% stake in LAN airlines at an [[Extraordinary General Meeting|extraordinary shareholders' meeting]] for his main holding company, Axxion.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Under the pact, Axxion shareholders have agreed to fix the price of the sale, estimated at 1.5 billion USD.

In January 2011 he faced the [[2011 Magallanes protests|protest in Magallanes Region]] in response to a proposed increase in the price of natural gas there by 16.8%.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The protests left more than two thousand cars isolated while trying to cross from the [[Tierra del Fuego Province (Argentina)|Argentine province of Tierra del Fuego]] to the [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina|province of Santa Cruz]] through Chilean territory.

[[Laurence Golborne]] became [[Ministry of Mining (Chile)|Mining]] and [[Ministry of Energy (Chile)|Energy]] Minister, on 16 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/detalle/detallenoticias.asp?idnoticia=458544|title=Piñera concreta su primer cambio de gabinete al aceptar la renuncia a otros tres ministros|publisher=[[El Mercurio|El Mercurio Online]]|date=14 January 2011|access-date=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, President Piñera led a state visit to [[Spain]] to boost relations between the two countries.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} While in Spain, President and Mrs Piñera, with [[Felipe, Prince of Asturias|Prince Felipe]] and [[Princess Letizia]], opened the exhibition ”Don Qui.

Amidst the severe [[2011 student protests in Chile|2011 Chilean student protest]]s Piñera shuffled his cabinet and removed [[Joaquín Lavín]] from the post of minister of education. With respect to the protest, Piñera has defended [[for-profit]] activity in education and proposed to legalize it, rejecting the students' demands for the public ownership of educational establishments.&lt;ref name="GANE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gob.cl/destacados/2011/07/05/cadena-nacional-de-radio-y-television-presidente-pinera-anuncio-gran-acuerdo-nacional-por-la-educaci.htm|title=Cadena Nacional de Radio y Televisión: Presidente Piñera anunció Gran Acuerdo Nacional por la Educación|trans-title=|language=Spanish|date=5 July 2011|website=www.Gob.cl|access-date=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During August 2011, Piñera's public approval declined precipitously amidst continuous protests, to the extent that some polls indicated that he was the least popular Chilean leader since Augusto Pinochet. His approval ratings dropped to as low as 22% according to a CERC survey.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cerc.cl {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131121073833/http://www.cerc.cl/ |date=21 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Piñera's chances of passing sought reforms were seen as remote.&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c1e72b62-d011-11e0-81e2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1X5tfH7X0 Teen shot in Chile anti-Piñera protest dies] [[Financial Times]]. 26 August 2011. 26 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Piñera visited [[Vietnam]] with the intention of increasing cooperation between the two countries in general and with [[Ho Chi Minh City]], Vietnam's most populous and largest economic hub, in particular.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} HCM City also called for a Chilean sister city while receiving Piñera on 23 March.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The visit included the signing of a bilateral trade agreement and several cooperation pacts in education, tourism, culture and finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.baomoi.com/Info/Vietnam-Chile-seek-stronger-ties/3/247906.epi|title=Vietnam, Chile seek stronger ties|language=|date=|website=Baomoi.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011 during a state visit to [[Mexico]] a joke made by Piñera where he compared women with politicians caused uproar in Chile, sparking criticism from his own minister [[Carolina Schmidt]] who said of the joke that it was "hurting to many women".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latercera.com/noticia/politica/2011/12/674-410092-9-ministra-schmidt-por-broma-de-pinera-el-chiste-no-solo-es-fome-sino-que-hiriente.shtml Ministra Schmidt por broma de Piñera: "El chiste no sólo es fome, sino que hiriente para muchas mujeres"], ''[[La Tercera]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the joke Piñera said that "when a lady says "no" it means maybe, when she says maybe it means yes and when she says yes she is not a lady."&lt;ref name="ElComercio"&gt;[http://elcomercio.pe/mundo/1344802/noticia-sebastian-pinera-criticado-chiste-machista-cumbre-mexico Sebastián Piñera criticado por chiste machista en cumbre de México], ''[[El Comercio (Peru)|El Comercio]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Chilean Network Against Domestic and Sexual Violence called the joke "misogynic" and "a shame for the whole country".&lt;ref name="ElComercio"/&gt; Previously on a state visit to Peru in 2011 Piñera received criticism for his informal style after he revealed to Peruvian president-elect [[Ollanta Humala]] that he was a descendant of the Inca [[Huayna Capac]].&lt;ref name="Chile21"&gt;[http://www.cambio21.cl/cambio21/site/artic/20110616/pags/20110616174729.html "Las Piñerías o Piñericosas siguen siendo el hazmerreir del gobierno.

{{further|List of presidential trips made by Sebastián Piñera}} On December 17th, Piñera won the second round of the [[Chilean general election, 2017|Chilean General election]], defeating the left wing candidate [[Alejandro Guillier]] to become President-Elect. Piñera took office for a second time on March 11th, 2018, succeeding the outgoing [[Michelle Bachelet]].

===Cabinet===

In January 2018, Piñera unveiled his [[Far-right politics|hardline]] cabinet to harsh criticism: his interior minister, [[Andrés Chadwick]], was a vocal supporter of Pinochet [[dictatorship]], which had previously appointed him president of the Catholic University Students Federation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/23/chile-president-elect-sebastian-pinera-andres-chadwick&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Chadwick expressed "deep repentance" for this support after discovering "over the years" serious human rights violations committed by the dictatorship, while defending the regime on other grounds.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cooperativa.cl/noticias/pais/augusto-pinochet/chadwick-por-su-rol-en-dictadura-me-arrepiento-de-no-haber-hecho-algo-mas/2012-06-11/130659.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Chadwick and justice minister [[Hernán Larraín]] were also "supporters and defenders of the secretive German enclave Colonia Dignidad, which was established by the fugitive [[Nazi]] officer and [[paedophile]] [[Paul Schäfer]] in the early 60s," according to the Guardian UK.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/23/chile-president-elect-sebastian-pinera-andres-chadwick&lt;/ref&gt; Colonia Dignidad was used by Pinochet security officials to [[torture]] and murder opponents of the regime.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/23/chile-president-elect-sebastian-pinera-andres-chadwick&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/aljazeeracorrespondent/2013/10/tales-torture-2013103081121394171.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Other appointees with [[far-right]] ties include [[Isabel Plá]], an anti-abortion advocate appointed to the Ministry of Women and Gender Equality, and mining minister [[Baldo Prokurica]], a governor under the Pinochet regime.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Chiles-Pinera-Announces-Far-Right-Cabinet-Picks-20180123-0024.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Piñera is associated with bad luck.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/noticias/2012/01/120110_cono_sur_chile_presidente_mala_suerte_psicologia_vh.shtml Piñera y los presidentes tachados de "mala suerte"]. [[BBC]].&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC has listed a series of situations of "bad luck" concerning Piñera's presidency: the [[2010 Maule earthquake]] followed by [[2010 Pichilemu earthquake|another quake]] during Piñera's inauguration ceremony, the [[2010 Copiapó mining accident|mining accident of 2010]], the [[2010 Santiago prison fire]], the [[2011 Puyehue-Cordón Caulle eruption]] and the [[2012 Araucanía wildfires|2012 wildfires]].&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

[[José Mujica]], president of Uruguay, stated Piñera's low approval rates might be caused by a lack of "[[glamour (presentation)|glamour]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/noticias/mundo/uruguay/jose-mujica-de-repente-pinera-tiene-poco-glamour/2013-02-02/113112.html|title=José Mujica: "De repente Piñera tiene poco glamour"|trans-title=|language=|date=2 February 2013|website=Cooperativa.cl|access-date=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012 ''[[The Economist]]'' described Piñera as being considered an "inept politician" by both the opposition and supporters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/21552566 Progress and its discontents]. ''[[The Economist]]'&lt;/ref&gt; The Chilean government responded by stating that ''The Economist's'' comment was disrespectful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/2012/04/13/535601/gobierno-le-responde-a-the-economist-y-califica-como-un-error-tratar-a-pinera-de-inepto.html|title=Gobierno responde a The Economist sobre epítetos a Presidente Piñera|trans-title=|language=|work=Emol|access-date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lapses, errors and inconveniences have been labelled "piñericosas" in Chile,&lt;ref name="ElMostrador"&gt;{{cite news|last=Saleh|first=Felipe|title=Por qué Piñera habla como telepredicador|trans-title=|language=|url=http://www.elmostrador.cl/noticias/pais/2011/03/07/por-que-pinera-habla-como-telepredicador/|access-date=5 December 2012|newspaper=El Mostrador|date=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a phenomenon comparable to [[Bushism]]s in the United States. Piñera notably confused the fictional character [[Robinson Crusoe]] with [[Alexander Selkirk]] while giving a speech on a state visit to [[Robinson Crusoe Island]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In June 2013, after visiting President Obama in the White House,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Souza|first1=Pete|title=P060413PS-0549|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/whitehouse/9314668689/in/set-72157634692105189/|website=The White House Flickr Photostream|access-date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he said, "I'm going to sit at the President of the United States' desk," breaking the White House's political protocols. [[Alfredo Moreno Charme]], Minister of Foreign Affairs, said "How many other presidents have done the same?" and Obama responded, "This is the only one," causing laughter between those there. Piñera then justified his abrupt actions by stating his daughter was born in the United States.&lt;ref name="entrevistalacuarta"&gt;[http://www.ellitoral.com/index.php/diarios/2011/01/03/opinion/OPIN-06.html "Piñera volvió a meter la pata".

'''Shareholder ownership value''' (SOV) 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wgfa.wharton.upenn.edu/VillalongaAmit121004.pdf|title=How Do Family Ownership, Control, and Management Affect Firm Value?|last=Belén Villalonga Harvard Business School |first=Raphael Amit - The Wharton School |date=2004-12-01|work=The Wharton School|accessdate=2014-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M87oXwAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22Shareholder+ownership+value%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MTM9U8nlBITqywPNs4GQCg&amp;redir_esc=y|title= Obbligazione Convertibile, Panico Del 1907, Finanza Sostenibile, Valutazione, Scudo Fiscale, Subprime, Finanza Straordinaria

is a financial theory that developed internationally after the [[subprime mortgage crisis]]. &lt;br&gt; It started at the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]] by the MBA student [[Paolo G. Alberoni]] and published in 1994.

The SOV theory argues there is a validity limit of [[William F. Sharpe]]'s [[capital asset pricing model|CAPM]]. CAPM fails to incorporate in the [[Weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] the decision power of majority shareholder (owner) that can affect the destination of the company/assets cash flows. The theory moves his base considering shareholder's power and [[total cost of ownership]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In the paper, Alberoni shows evidence and structures a referenced framework demonstrating how the [[Stock exchange]] prices fails to capture the full value of assets in the long term and therefore undervalues them in the long run. Whilst in takeover there is a "premium paid" to majority shareholders vs minority shareholders. This Majority premium is essentially connected to the ability of the Majority Shareholder to influence how cash flows are used in the company

The evidence has been gathered as follow: under common wisdom a company that dismisses real assets and leases them back gets benefits from tax breaks, better liquidity, etc. The SOV theory looks back and shows that "assets free" companies are more vulnerable to extreme shocks and have recorded performance in line with "asset loaded" companies in the same field. Therefore, there must be a "missing part" in the original valuation.

The paper highlights how companies with assets in the long term can outperform and overcome economic and financial downturns, and are able to provide "real return" in excess of inflation with reduced volatility relative to asset free companies (who in a broad sense demand to shareholders to create a strategy for the cash flows generated by the sales of assets).

'''Sportsmark''' is [[Sport England|Sport England's]] accreditation scheme for secondary schools. The scheme recognises a school's out of hours sports provision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportdevelopment.org.uk/html/sportsmarks.html Sportsmark &amp; Activemark] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012084647/http://www.sportdevelopment.org.uk/html/sportsmarks.html |date=2006-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sportsmark awards are given to secondary schools for provision for sport and physical education. They are currently being reviewed along with [[Activemark]] awards with plans for a new sports partnership mark. When the policies were introduced there was little other investment into school sport. In England, if a school or college is given sportsmark accreditation, it is then entered for specialist status.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3534">The '''Spreckels Sugar Company''' is an [[United States|American]] [[sugar beet]] refiner that for many years controlled much of the [[West Coast of the United States|U.S. West Coast]] refined sugar market. It is currently headquartered in [[Brawley, California]].

==History==
The Spreckels Sugar Company was founded by entrepreneur, industrialist, newspaper publisher, and railroad executive [[Claus Spreckels]] (1828–1908) in February 1899. He founded the [[company town]] of [[Spreckels, California]], just south of the city of [[Salinas, California]], in 1897, but his descendants began to relinquish control when they started selling homes in the community to the public c. 1925. In 1891, [[Henry O. Havemeyer]], who controlled The American Sugar Refining Company (The Sugar Trust), bought half of the stock of the Western Sugar Company, thus giving his company control of the Hawaiian sugar and of the markets west of the [[Mississippi River]]. When it was completed in 1899, Spreckels' "Factory 1" was the largest sugar refinery in the United States and the third-largest in the world. Shipping to and from the plant was mostly by a private Spreckels-owned narrow-gauge railroad system connecting to the docks at [[Moss Landing, California]]. The factory was just north of the [[Salinas River (California)|Salinas River]] at {{coord| 36|37|7|N| 121|39|5|W| type:landmark_region:US-CA| display=inline,title}}.

On Claus Spreckels' death, his second son [[Adolph B. Spreckels]] (1857–1924) assumed the management of Spreckels Sugar Company. Adolph's wife's nephew, [[Charles Edouard de Bretteville]], eventually took over as head of the company and in 1949 led a group that purchased control. In 1963, the family sold their interests to [[Domino Foods|Amstar]]. In 1987, a management team bought out the Spreckels Sugar Division; in 1996, it was sold to [[Imperial Sugar|Imperial Holly Corp.]] of [[Sugar Land, Texas]], who owned it until 2005 when it was sold to [[Southern Minnesota Beet Sugar Cooperative]] of [[Renville, Minnesota]].

Spreckels Boulevard outside Salinas, as well as Spreckels Road outside [[King City, California]] and Spreckels Boulevard in [[Manteca, California]], still bear witness to the mark Spreckels Sugar made in the area.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2007/03/19/sugar-factory-stunk-to-olfactory/&lt;/ref&gt;

American author [[John Steinbeck]] worked on ranches owned by Spreckels Sugar throughout the Salinas Valley in the early 1920s.

'''''The Peter Pyramid''''' ( {{ISBN|0-04-440057-8}} ) is a book published in 1986 by Dr. [[Laurence Peter|Laurence J. Peter]], who also wrote ''[[Peter Principle|The Peter Principle]]'' published in 1969.

In this book he turns his attention to proliferating [[bureaucracy|bureaucracies]], burgeoning officialdom and does for the system what the [[Peter Principle]] did for the individual.

With a host of unfortunate examples for real life, Dr. Peter shows how major organizations are constructed upside down, with the point of operation all but invisible beneath the bulk of a top-heavy administration.

Cutting through the red tape he suggests, with humour and wisdom, dozens of ways to simplify meaningless complexity and stop the current procession of the bland leading the bland.

==Plot==
Duke brothers Randolph and Mortimer own a successful commodities brokerage in [[Philadelphia]]. Holding opposing views on the issue of [[nature versus nurture]], they make a wager and agree to conduct an experiment switching the lives of two unwitting people at opposite sides of the [[social hierarchy]] and observing the results. They witness an encounter between their managing director&amp;mdash;the well-mannered and educated Louis Winthorpe III, engaged to the Dukes' grand-niece Penelope&amp;mdash;and a poor street hustler named Billy Ray Valentine; Valentine is arrested at Winthorpe's insistence because of a suspected robbery attempt. The Dukes decide to use the two men for their experiment.

Winthorpe is publicly framed as a thief, drug dealer and philanderer by Clarence Beeks at the request of the Dukes. Winthorpe is fired from Duke &amp; Duke, his bank accounts are frozen, he is denied entry to his Duke-owned home, and he quickly finds himself vilified by Penelope and his former friends. He befriends Ophelia, a prostitute who agrees to help him in exchange for a financial reward once he is exonerated. Meanwhile, the Dukes bail Valentine out of jail, install him in Winthorpe's former job and grant him use of Winthorpe's home. Valentine soon becomes well-versed in the business using his street smarts to achieve success, and begins to act well-mannered.

During the firm's [[Christmas]] party, Winthorpe is caught planting drugs in Valentine's desk in an attempt to frame him, and he brandishes a gun to escape. Later, the Dukes discuss their experiment and settle their wager for one dollar, before plotting to return Valentine to the streets. Valentine overhears the conversation, and seeks out Winthorpe, who attempts suicide by overdosing on pills. Valentine, Ophelia and Winthorpe's butler Coleman nurse him back to health and inform him of the Dukes' experiment. On television, they learn that Clarence Beeks is transporting a secret [[USDA]] report on orange crop forecasts. Winthorpe and Valentine recall large payments made to Beeks by the Dukes and realize that the Dukes plan to obtain the report to [[cornering the market|corner the market]] on frozen orange juice.

On New Year's Eve, the four board Beeks' Philadelphia-bound train, intending to switch the original report with a forgery that predicts low orange crop yields. Beeks uncovers their scheme and attempts to kill them, but he is knocked unconscious by a gorilla being transported on the train. The four disguise Beeks with a gorilla costume and cage him with the real gorilla. After delivering the forged report to the Dukes in Beeks' place, Valentine and Winthorpe travel to New York City with Coleman's and Ophelia's life savings to carry out their part of the plan.

On the commodities [[Open outcry|trading floor]], the Dukes commit all their holdings to buying frozen concentrated orange-juice [[futures contract]]s; other traders follow their lead, inflating the price. Meanwhile, Valentine and Winthorpe sell futures heavily at the inflated price. Following the broadcast of the actual crop report and its prediction of a normal forecast, the price of orange-juice futures plummets. Valentine and Winthorpe close their futures position by [[Short (finance)|buying futures at the lower price]] from everyone but the Dukes, turning a large profit. The Dukes fail to meet a [[margin call]], and are left owing $394 million. Valentine and Winthorpe explain to the Dukes that they had made a wager on whether they could simultaneously get rich while making the Dukes poor. Valentine collects $1 from Winthorpe while Randolph collapses holding his chest and Mortimer shouts angrily at his brother about their failed plan. Later, the now wealthy Valentine, Winthorpe, Ophelia, and Coleman vacation on a tropical beach, while Beeks and the gorilla are loaded onto a ship heading for Africa.

==Themes==
The storyline of ''Trading Places''&amp;mdash;a member of society trading places with another whose socio-economic status stands in direct contrast to his own&amp;mdash;often draws comparisons to [[Mark Twain]]'s novel ''[[The Prince and the Pauper]]''.&lt;ref name="EBERT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BUDD"&gt;{{harvnb|Budd|2002|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Min|1999|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Childs|2006|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Truby|2007|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; First published in 1881, the novel follows the lives of a prince and a beggar&amp;mdash;both of them of adolescent age&amp;mdash;who use their uncanny resemblance to each other as a premise to switch places temporarily; the prince takes on a life of poverty and misery while the pauper enjoys the lavish luxuries of a royal life. Parallels have also been drawn between ''Trading Places'' and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s 18th century comic opera ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' in which a servant (Figaro) foils the plans of his rich master who tried to steal Figaro's bride to be.&lt;ref name="CAVELL"&gt;{{harvnb|Cavell|2005|pp=309–311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MONAHAN"&gt;Monahan, Mark.

American philosopher and professor at [[Harvard University]] [[Stanley Cavell]] wrote about ''Trading Places'' in his 2005 book ''Cavell on Film''. Cavell postulates that film is sometimes used as a new technology in the production and experience of an opera. He explains that this axiom asserts its importance not in the fact that "our time" sees an increased expectation of new operas being developed but, rather, in the fact that there is an increased expectation of "new productions of operas." Cavell draws a comparison of themes between ''Trading Places'' and the opera ''The Marriage of Figaro'', stating that "what ''Trading Places'' wants from its reference to ''Figaro'' is mostly the idea of resourceful and sociable young and poor overcoming with various disguises the conniving of the unsociable old and rich but with no sense that the old may be redeemed by a recognition of their faults and no revolutionary desire to see the world formed on a new basis."&lt;ref name="CAVELL"/&gt;

David Budd, in his 2002 book ''Culture Meets Culture in the Movies'', writes about the experiences of characters when the expected roles of races in society are sometimes reversed. The 1995 fiction film ''[[White Man's Burden (film)|White Man's Burden]]'' and [[John Howard Griffin]]'s factual book ''[[Black Like Me]]'' are used as a foundation to show how different the experience of white people can be when subjected to the prejudices faced by black people. In that respect, Budd proclaims ''Trading Places'' as "uncannily illustrative if heavy-handed". Beginning from the premise that, in the film, the "expectations of the races also stand upon their head", Budd states that "through even a highly comedic vessel a message loudly asking for a reassessment of prejudice, and for level playing fields, is heard."&lt;ref name="BUDD"/&gt;

===Critical response===
''Trading Places'' was met with positive reviews from critics. Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film an approval rating of 86%, based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3 out of 10. The site's consensus states: "Featuring deft interplay between Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd, ''Trading Places'' is an immensely appealing social satire."&lt;ref name="RottenTomatoes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/trading_places/ |title=Trading Places (1983) |publisher = Flixster | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=September 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] gave the film a score of 66 out of 100, based on 9 critics, which indicates "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref name="Metacritic"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/trading-places | title=Trading Places| publisher = CBS Interactive | work = [[Metacritic]] | accessdate=September 25, 2012 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310171246/http://www.metacritic.com/movie/trading-places|archivedate=2011-03-10|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and critic [[Richard Schickel]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called ''Trading Places'' "one of the most emotionally satisfying and morally gratifying comedies of recent times". While admitting Aykroyd's success in demonstrating "perfect prissiness as Winthorpe", Schickel commented on Murphy's performance as Valentine calling Murphy "a force to be reckoned with" and stating that he "makes ''Trading Places'' something more than a good-hearted comedy. He turns it into an event."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Schickel|Schickel, Richard]].

Accessed April 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] of ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' awarded the film three and a half stars out of four, while offering that the film resembles ''[[Tootsie]]'' and comparing it to comedies of [[Frank Capra]] and [[Preston Sturges]]. Ebert stated "This is good comedy"; he described the characters as "wonderful comic inventions" that rose above what could have been [[stock characters|stereotypes]] due to the actors' skill and explained that the comedy is successful because it "develops the quirks and peculiarities of its characters, so that they're funny because of who they are." He further commented on the cast by favorably commenting on acting as "engaging", stating that "Murphy and Aykroyd are perfect foils for each other", that they're both capable of being "specifically eccentric", that "they both play characters with a lot of native intelligence" and concluding that "It's fun to watch them thinking." Commenting on Bellamy and Ameche in the roles of the Duke brothers, Ebert called their involvement in the film "a masterstroke of casting."&lt;ref name="EBERT"&gt;[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]].

[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' repeated some of Roger Ebert's sentiments stating that "Preston Sturges might have made a movie like ''Trading Places'' - if he'd had a little less inspiration and a lot more money." She, again, also commended the cast by calling it "well-chosen", commenting on Murphy and Aykroyd as "the two actors best suited", stating that the Duke brothers were "played delightfully" by Ameche and Bellamy and&amp;mdash;concluding that "the supporting cast is also quite good"&amp;mdash;praising Curtis for managing "to turn a hard-edged, miniskirted prostitute into a character of unexpected charm."&lt;ref&gt;[[Janet Maslin|Maslin, Janet]].

==Legacy==
Almost 30 years after its release, the plot for the movie was part of the inspiration for new regulations on the financial markets. On March 3, 2010, [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] chief [[Gary Gensler]] stated, in testimony he gave to the 111th Congress: "We have recommended banning using misappropriated government information to trade in the commodity markets. In the movie ''Trading Places'', starring Eddie Murphy, the Duke brothers intended to profit from trades in frozen concentrated orange juice futures contracts using an illicitly obtained and not yet public Department of Agriculture orange crop report."&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2010/03/04/first-the-volcker-rule-now-the-eddie-murphy-rule/ First The Volcker Rule, Now The Eddie Murphy Rule!], ''Market Beat'', a part of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. Accessed September 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Eddie Murphy Rule", as it came to be known, later came into effect as Section 136 of the [[Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act]] of the [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], under Section 746, which dealt with [[insider trading]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4173/text?version=enr&amp;nid=t0:enr:6252 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act], [[OpenCongress]]. Accessed September 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Italy]] the movie has become a Christmas classic, being broadcast by Italian television every year, from December 24, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|language=it|title=Perché a ogni vigilia di Natale c'è "Una poltrona per due" su Italia 1|url=https://www.lastampa.it/2015/12/23/spettacoli/perch-a-ogni-vigilia-di-natale-c-una-poltrona-per-due-su-italia-yFBmsiobgCaGXoUlOShWsM/pagina.html|newspaper=La Stampa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Forbes of Callendar by Sir Henry Raeburn, SNPG.JPG|thumb|William Forbes of Callendar by Sir [[Henry Raeburn]] (detail) 1798]]
'''Sir William Forbes of Callendar''' (1756–1823) was a prosperous [[copper]]smith and landowner who lived in [[Callendar House]] in [[Falkirk]], [[Scotland]].

==Biography==
Forbes was a self-made man. The son of an [[Aberdeen]] merchant, he began work as a coppersmith and won a government contract to sheath ships' [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]s in copper. With the fortune he made (equivalent to over [[USD|$]]1 billion in today's terms), he purchased the estates of Callendar and [[Linlithgow]] near Falkirk, which had been forfeited by the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] [[Earl of Linlithgow]] after the [[1715 Jacobite rising]]. He bought the estates at auction and is said to have astounded bystanders by producing a banknote for £100,000, specially printed for the occasion, at the age of just 40. At the time he was the greatest landowner in the county, with some of the largest collected lands in [[Scotland]]. He was not popular with local people, but nevertheless his family retained great influence over the area for two centuries.

Wishing to set himself up as a 'landed gentleman', William purchased further vast estates in [[Ayrshire]], Earlstoun, [[Kirkcudbrightshire]] and [[Dumfriesshire]]. He spent ten years making improvements to Callendar House, dividing his time between the house and London. He gave orders for the complete renovation and refurnishing of the entire house, adding a new wing and ripping out old rooms. He added the various turrets and exterior decoration which give the house its chateau-like appearance today. Although William preferred the newest fashion (and purchased the best furniture and household goods from makers in London and [[Edinburgh]]) he did not spend money recklessly, ordering the new servants' wing to be furnished 'in the cheapest way'.

His first wife was Margaret McAdam, daughter of John McAdam of [[Craigengillan]]. She did not keep well and was sent to Madeira for her health's sake. There she died, at the early age of 28, in March 1793. Her gravestone, English marble, sent from London, can be seen in the English Cemetery, Funchal.  Forbes remarried in 1806 Agnes Chalmers, daughter of John Chalmers of Old Machar in Aberdeen. This union produced two sons and three daughters. The Forbes household settled down after William's marriage and he began to spend more time in Callendar House and give his brother David greater control of the business in London.

In 1794, aged 51, he retired to become a full-time landowner, rejecting the idea of employing a factor trained in the needs of estate management and elected to manage the {{convert|8000|acre|km2|adj=on}} estates himself. His first son William, 2nd of Callendar, went on to become [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Stirlingshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Stirlingshire]].

Forbes' descendants sold Callendar House in the 1960s and are listed in ''[[Burke's Landed Gentry]]''.
