'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right to access information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right to access public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Albania]] the right to access to public information is guaranteed by the Constitution and by the Law on the Right to Information approved in 2014 and providing for a sound legal framework regulating access to public information.&lt;ref name=ECPMF&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ecpmf.eu/news/ecpmf/interviews-balkan/rudina-hoxha-editor-follow-business-albania |title="A problem is its efficient implementation"  |last= |first= |date=12 January 2017 |website=Ecpmf.eu |publisher=European Centre for Press and Media Freedom |access-date= 25 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite some significant progress toward securing the right to information over the last years, notable weakness remains in the functioning of the system and in the implementation of the law. Access is still a challenge in a country with a strong culture of secrecy and confidentiality.&lt;ref name=WB&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2012 |title=Implementing Right to Information. A Case study of Albania |url=http://www.right2info.org/resources/publications/publications/wb_implementing-rti_albania_2012 |publisher= The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / the World Bank |access-date= 25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Albania provides both constitutional and legal guarantees of the right to information. Efforts to establish a constitutional and legal framework securing citizens' right to access public information date back to the early 1990s during Albania's transition from a Communist country to a multi-party democratic system.&lt;ref name=WB/&gt;

The Constitution, effective since 1998, enshrined this right in Article 23 and provides for the right of every person to access information held by state bodies and to attend public meetings.&lt;ref name=OSCE&gt;{{cite journal |author=David Banisar |date=April 2006 |title= Comments and Legal Regulations on Access to Information and State Secrets in Albania |url=https://www.osce.org/fom/18934?download=true  |publisher= OSCE. The Representative on Freedom of the Media |access-date= 25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the parliament passed the Law 8503, the ''Right to Information about Official Documents law'', becoming the first country in the region to adopt a legislation on freedom of information.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt; Currently, access to information is regulated by the Law on the Right to Information approved in 2014, which is an upgrade of previous laws and regulations.&lt;ref name="BIRN"&gt;{{cite journal |date=April 2006 |title=Transparency in the Balkans and Moldova |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/file/show/Transparency-in-the-Balkans-and-Moldova.pdf  
|publisher= Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) |access-date= 25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albania has also committed itself to realize the right to access public information through several  international agreements. In 2002, Albania ratified the Convention on access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters ([[Aarhus Convention]]) which requires the adoption of laws on access to environmental information. Moreover, as a member of the [[Council of Europe]], Albania has committed to comply with a 2002 recommendation on access to official document.&lt;ref name="OSCE" /&gt;

==Legal Framework==

The new Right to Information Law of Albania has been assessed by many experts as one of the most important steps towards transparency and accountability, bringing Albanian legislation closer with the best international standards.&lt;ref name=IDFI&gt;{{cite web |url=https://idfi.ge/en/new%E2%80%93freedom%E2%80%93of%E2%80%93ifnromation%E2%80%93legislation%E2%80%93albania  |title=New Right to Information Law in Albania |last= |first= |date= 7 November 2014 |website=Idfi.ge |publisher= Institute for Development of Freedom of Information (IDFI) |access-date=25 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/new-foia-law-could-usher-era-of-transparency-in-albania   |title=Albania Rights Groups Hail New New FOI Law |last= |first= |date= 1 October 2014 |website=BalkanInsight.com |publisher=BalkanInsight |access-date=25 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new law provided greater access for the public to official documents, and sets forth a system of penalties for public officials who refused to disclose information.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt; The new legislation includes also an array of new concepts, such as the possibility of reclassifying secret documents, the release of partial information and the use of [[Information and communications technology|ICTs]] to make information held py public bodies available and accessible to the public.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt; The law also establishes the obligation to appoint coordinators for access to information by every public authority charged with the task of supervising the authority’s responses to information requests and created the institution of a Commissioner for the Right to Information and Protection of Personal Data charged with supervising and monitoring compliance with the law and appeals bodies and procedures in cases of refusal or partial disclosure.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt; Under the new law the Commissioner has the faculty to use disciplinary sanctions against those violating the requirements established in the law.&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt; The sanction system for failure to respect the right to information has been strengthened with the introduction of heavy administrative sanctions for officials violating the law.&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt;

Furthermore, the new has broadened the scope of the definition of the term “public information” defined as any data registered in any form and format, maintained by a public authority as well as the definition of the term “public authority” which now encompasses commercial companies where the state hold the majority of shares, as well as any legal entity exercising public functions.&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt; Proactivity of publication for certain categories of information has been introduced.&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt;

The law establishes that requests for information of public interest can be made orally or in writing.&lt;ref name="BIRN" /&gt; The provision of information is free of charge: the law only enables public bodies to charge the costs for photocopying; no charge can be applied to electronic delivery.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;

Public bodies are obliged to give an answer within 10 days from the submission of the request (under the previous legal framework it was 40).&lt;ref name=ECPMF/&gt; In case the request is rejected, the applicant has the right to appeal to the Commissioner and then to the courts.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;

Exceptions to the right to information are established by the law, including for reasons of national security and international and intergovernmental relations.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==

Despite the improvements introduced by the new legal framework, the effectiveness of its implementation still remains to be seen. According to the journalist Rudina Hoxha, one of the problem is that the two institutions that should monitor the application of the law, meaning the Information and Data Protection Commissioner and the Ombudsman, have in fact a counseling character and even though by the law they are entitled to apply sanctions, this happens very rarely.&lt;ref name=ECPMF/&gt;

According to a 2016 report by the NGO ''Mjaft Movement'', Albanian public institutions comply with their obligations to provided public information under FOI requests only in 42% of the cases. To test and monitor the application of the new law, the organisation submitted 230 requests for information to different public bodies, including central institutions, local ones, justice institutions and public universities. Out of 230 requests, only 98 replies were obtained. Only 80 of these answers disclosed the required information. The remaining 18 were cases of incomplete information provision.&lt;ref name=BIRN2016&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/albanian-institutions-difficulties-in-doing-transparency-07-11-2016   |title=Albanian institutions fail a transparency test |last= |first= |date= 12 July 2016 |website=BalkanInsight.com |publisher=BalkanInsight |access-date=25 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report found out that Albanian municipalities were the most problematic and opaque institutions in terms of applying the FOI law. The main problem concerned non-compliance with the obligation to appoint the coordinator on the right to information and great lack of transparency on budget and financial issues.&lt;ref name=BIRN2016/&gt;

The '''2009 [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]] protests''' were a series of protests which occurred on 27 December 2009 in [[Iran]] against the outcome of the June [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|2009 Iranian presidential election]], which demonstrators claim was [[electoral fraud|rigged]]. The demonstrations were part of the [[2009 Iranian election protests]] and were the largest since June. In December 2009, the protests saw an escalation in violence.&lt;ref name=Spiegel&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,669317,00.html | author=Ulrike Putz| title= Violence in Tehran; Iranian Demonstrators Put Regime on the Defensive |publisher=Spiegel International |date=29 December 2009|accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/12/december-18-marked-the-beginning.html |title=Ashura 101 – Tehran Bureau &amp;#124; FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/12/ashura-videos.html |title=Ashura videos [Graphic&amp;#93; – Tehran Bureau &amp;#124; FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to this protest, [[December 30, 2009 pro-government rally in Iran|pro-government protesters hold a rally]] in a "show of force" three days later on December 30 (9 [[Dey (month)|Dey]]) to condemn Green Movement protester.&lt;ref name="Al-monitor"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karami|first1=Arash|title=Iran marks anniversary of anti-Green Movement protests|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/12/iran-anti-green-movement-protest-anniversary.html|accessdate=January 12, 2017|agency=Al-Monitor|date=December 30, 2014|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Irregularities during the [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|2009 Iranian presidential election]] caused resentment among many Iranians. While post-election protests were mostly peaceful, some violence erupted, leading to clashes between security forces and protesters, while some outspoken political dissenters were detained.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, Opposition leaders detained in Iran, 19 June 2009 [https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/opposition-leaders-detained-in-iran-20090619]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, dissenters continued to speak out against the Government, leading to further protests in December 2009. On 19 December 2009, the Grand Ayatollah [[Hossein Ali Montazeri]], who had become a "spiritual leader" of the opposition, died. Montazeri's funeral, held on 21 December in the city of [[Qom]], was attended by a large gathering of people&lt;ref name=Spiegel/&gt; and clashes ensued between security forces and mourners,&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; leading on to further demonstrations in Qom and [[Isfahan]].&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; On 26 December, a paramilitary [[Basij]] force subordinate to the [[Iranian Revolutionary Guard]] stormed a mosque in [[Tehran]] where scholar and former [[President of Iran|President]] [[Mohammad Khatami]] was speaking.&lt;ref name=Spiegel/&gt;&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; This was followed by continued clashes in Tehran in which ''Jaras'', a news media of the critics, estimated eight to ten people had died.&lt;ref name=Spiegel/&gt;

Prior to [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]], Mohsen Kadivar said he could not "rule out the possibility" of state intervention in the planned protests.&lt;ref name=spiegel-2/&gt;

==Events==
===Protests===
{{see also|December 30, 2009 pro-government rally in Iran}}
On 27 December, demonstrations in several cities continued into the holy day of [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]] the climax of [[Muharram]], the month of mourning. Protesters in Tehran gathered "From Imam Hussain Square to Freedom Square", "from east to west along Revolution Street", and it was on this day that "the political and religious symbology of Iran's Islamic regime was turned on its head".&lt;ref name=time.com/&gt;  The protesters made another symbolic move- a "symbolic journey from a square named after its most revered hero toward a monument dedicated to freedom, along a street called Revolution."&lt;ref name=time.com/&gt;

[[Death of Seyed Ali Mousavi|Seyed Ali Mousavi]], the 35-year-old nephew of [[Mir-Hossein Mousavi]], was among those killed in the violence.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=time.com/&gt; Later, it was reported that his body had disappeared, precluding the possibility of a quick burial, while state sources indicated that an autopsy was being performed.&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8432297.stm | author=BBC| title=Iran opposition figures arrested after protests|publisher=BBC| date=28 December 2009|accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mousavi was buried on 30 December.&lt;ref name=aad/&gt;

Similar protests took place in other Iranian cities including [[Isfahan]], [[Najafabad]], [[Shiraz]], [[Mashhad]], [[Arak, Iran|Arak]], [[Tabriz]], [[Babol]], [[Ardabil]] and [[Orumieh]].&lt;ref name=WP&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-government protests turn deadly in Tehran|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6562649.ece|last=Erdbrink|first=Thomas|work=Washington Post|location=Washington D.C., US |date=27 December 2009|accessdate=27 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt; Four people were reportedly killed in [[Tabriz]], in north western Iran on 27 December, and one in Shiraz in the south of Iran.&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran protesters killed, including Mousavi's nephew |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8431523.stm|publisher=BBC News |date=27 December 2009|accessdate=27 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1&gt;{{cite news|title= Police Are Said to Have Killed 10 in Iran Protests  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/28/world/middleeast/28iran.html|last= Robert F.

State controlled media initially denied any deaths, though it was indicated on 28 December that 15 had died, including ten "well-known anti-revolutionary terrorists".&lt;ref name=Spiegel/&gt; According to the official news agency of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Tehran's Safety Services said that "Nine residential buildings, 9 vehicles, 7 shops, 2 banks and 3 power stations were set on fire [by anti-government protesters]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=114838&amp;sectionid=351020101 |title=No Operation |publisher=Presstv.ir |accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 December, counter-rallies staged and organized by the government at various cities, including Tehran, Qom, Arak, Shiraz and Isfahan called for the death of the protesters, with government workers receiving the day off work in order to attend the demonstrations.&lt;ref name=aad&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2010628830_apmliran.html |title=Iran hardliners call for killing rivals at rallies |author=Ali Akbar Dareini (AP) |publisher=Seattle Times |date=30 December 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103091352/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2010628830_apmliran.html |archivedate=3 January 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
{{POV-section|date=June 2017}}
According to Ibrahim Moussawi, associate professor of [[Lebanese University]] and head of [[Hizbullah]]'s media relations, the incident damaged "public relations" of the Green Movement with Iranian citizenry more than all events as the acts of the protesters on that day including "applauding, whistling, and engaging in other cheerful displays," was "widely" seen as violation of a "red line" and targeting [[Husayn ibn Ali]] and [[Day of Ashura|Ashura commemoration]] itself.&lt;ref name="Ibrahim"/&gt; Various society groups including "[[Marja'|marej-'e taqlid]], the society of Iranian doctors, university student groups, the Iranian Parliament, Oil Industry Workers, the Iranian Women's Culture and Education Society, the Society of Iranian Teachers, the Iranian Professors Society, provincial governors and municipalities and [[bazaar]]s" expressed their condemnation and many of them publicly asked for the "prosecution of the opposition leaders".&lt;ref name="Ibrahim"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moussawi|first1=Ibrahim|title=Shi&amp;‘ism and the Democratisation Process in Iran: With a focus on Wilayat al-Faqih|publisher=Saqi|isbn=9780863568312|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_kAhBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT157&amp;lpg=PT157&amp;dq=Desecration+of+Ashura+2009+protest&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n50eaC439t&amp;sig=Ohsem0SVCFkGQXFkH_x5B7ACrfY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiG2KHG0r3RAhWGYJoKHVrxDCEQ6AEIPDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Desecration%20of%20Ashura%202009%20protest&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trials==
Many people are set to stand trial for taking part in the protests. At least one person arrested in connection with the protest, a university lecturer [[Abdolreza Ghanbari]] living in [[Pakdasht]], has been accused of "[[moharebeh]]," (an Islamic term meaning "warring against God") and sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.labourstart.org/cgi-bin/solidarityforever/show_campaign.cgi?c=1299 |title=Iran: Stop the execution of Abdolreza Ghanbari |publisher=labourstart.org |year=2012 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/15/AR2010011500705.html|title=Iran to try 16 people soon over December unrest: report|work=Washington Post|accessdate=16 January 2010}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International reaction==
The governments of Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States are among those who have condemned the violence.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; [[POTUS|US President]] [[Barack Obama]] openly criticized the Iranian government's violent crackdown on the protests in a speech and declared "The decision of Iran's leaders to govern through fear and tyranny will not continue."&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt;  Russia's Foreign Ministry expressed concern at the violence. It encouraged "a compromise on the basis of the law, and also to take political efforts to prevent a further escalation of the confrontation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20091228/157405302.html |title=Russia voices concern over Tehran unrest &amp;#124; Russia &amp;#124; RIA Novosti |publisher=En.rian.ru |date=28 December 2009 |accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venezuela condemned what it called Western governments' interference in Iran's internal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-12/31/content_12732931.htm |title=Venezuela blames U.S. for destabilizing Iran_English_Xinhua |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=31 December 2009 |accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slogans==
Since the protest coincided with [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]], the commemoration observed by Shi'as for the death of [[Imam Hussein]], the third Imam of Shia's who were killed by the order of [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Caliph]] [[Yazid I]], protesters deliberately blended their political message with the Ashura's religious one in this protest. They alternated anti-government slogans with ancient cries of mourning for [[Imam Hussein]].&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;

*"This is a month of blood. The dictator will fall"&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; Protesters equated [[Ayatollah Khamenei]] with [[Yazid I]], the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Caliph]] who ordered Imam Hussein's killing.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;
*"Death to the dictator"&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;
* "Death to Khamenei"&lt;ref name=time.com&gt;{{cite news|title=On a Holy Day, Protest and Carnage in Tehran|author=TIME Staff |date=28 December 2009|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1950176,00.html|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its [http://people.virginia.edu/~gc4q/index.php/people/48-gerald-l-clore.html chief application] is in computer science as the emotion engine of intelligent agents in computer games, and interactive training modules." Anthony Ortony, professor at Northwestern University with a focus on Psychology, Education, and Computer Science; Gerald L. Clore is a Psychology Professor at the University of Virginia with a focus on emotion and its cognitive consequences; and Allan Collins is professor of Learning Sciences specializing in Education, Psychology, and Artificial Intelligence at Northwestern University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;In ''The Cognitive Structure of Emotions'' Ortony, Clore and Collins describe the intensity of joy emotions; praiseworthiness affects the intensity of pride emotions, and appealingness affects the intensity of the object-based attraction emotions. The "perception of charm and physical beauty" through their influence on "appealingness" only have an indirect effect on the intensity of attraction emotions.&lt;/ref&gt;
''Attraction'' may also refer to the object of the attraction itself, as in ''[[tourist attraction]]''.

==Visual attractiveness==
Visual attractiveness or visual appeal is attraction produced primarily by [[visual perception|visual stimuli]].

==Physical attractiveness==
{{Main|Physical attractiveness}}

[[Physical attractiveness]] is the perception of the physical traits of an individual [[human]] [[person]] as pleasing or [[beauty|beautiful]]. It can include various implications, such as [[sexual attractiveness]], [[cuteness]], [[Interpersonal attraction#Similarity (like-attracts-like)|similarity]] and [[physical attractiveness|physique]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Physical attractiveness can also include the attraction of smell. Pheromones secreted by animals and humans alike can attract others, and this is viewed as being attracted to smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/14/science-of-attraction-_n_6661522.html|title=The Strange Science Of Sexual Attraction|last=Gregoire|first=Carolyn|date=2015-02-14|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=HuffPo isn't the best possible source for medicine related topics|date=June 2018}} [[Human sex pheromones]] may play a role in human attraction, although it is unclear how well humans can actually pick up on the pheromones of another. 

Judgment of attractiveness of physical traits is partly universal to all human cultures, partly dependent on culture or [[society]] or time period, partly biological, and partly subjective and individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hönekopp | first = Johannes | authorlink = | title = Once more: Is beauty in the eye of the beholder? Relative contributions of private and shared taste to judgments of facial attractiveness | publisher = APA| year = 2006 | url = http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/hsw/psychologie/professuren/allpsy2/Artikel/JEPHPP_2006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cognitive_emotions_1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Review_Ortony_1989"/&gt;

==The Science Behind Attraction==
According to a study determining the golden ratio for facial beauty, the most attractive face is one with average distances between facial features, and an average length and width of the face itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pallett|first=Pamela|last2=Link|first2=Stephen|last3=Lee|first3=Kang|date=November 6, 2009|title=New "Golden" Ratios for Facial Beauty|pmc=2814183|journal=Vision Research|volume=50|pages=149–154|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Facial attractiveness, or [[beauty]], can also be determined by symmetry. If a face is asymmetrical, this can indicate unhealthy genetic information. Therefore, if a face is symmetrical (see [[Facial symmetry]]), healthy genetic information is implied. People will judge potential mates based off the physical expression of the genetic health, which is their apparent attractiveness&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=B.C.|last2=Little|first2=A.C.|last3=Penton-Voak|first3=I.S.|last4=Tiddeman|first4=B.P.|last5=Burt|first5=D.M.|last6=Perrett|first6=D.I.|date=November 2001|title=Facial symmetry and judgements of apparent health: Support for a “good genes” explanation of the attractiveness–symmetry relationship|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513801000836|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|volume=22|pages=417-420|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This supports the good genes theory, which indicates that attractiveness is seen as a way to ensure that offspring will have the healthiest genes and therefore the best chance of survival. Certain trains that indicate good genes (such as clear skin or facial symmetry) are seen as desirable when choosing a partner&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/good-genes-hypothesis|title=Good genes hypothesis|last=The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica|first=|date=|website=Encyclopedia Brittanica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Sexual Selection and Attraction in Non-human Animals==

Among animals, females often are "choosy" about who they pick for a mate. They will look for characteristics in their potential mates that ensure their offspring will have healthy genetic material. Therefore, they will be attracted to certain traits or behaviors of their potential mates. Attraction among animals is based mostly on what will give the females the best chance of having the most and healthiest offspring that will likely survive to adulthood because of the traits they will inherit from the male&lt;ref&gt; Alcock, J. (2001). The Evolution of Reproductive Behavior. In Animal Behavior. (7 ed. pp. 341) Sunderland, Massachusetts: Arizona State University. &lt;/ref&gt;. Females will look for signs of health in the males, such as large and fancy adornments, bright colors, or other features that the male will only have if he is in good health. &lt;ref&gt;Bateson, P. Editor. (1983). Sexual Selection by Female Choice by Peter O'Donald. in Mate Choice. (pp.&amp;nbsp;53). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Eye candy (slang for visual appeal)==
Eye candy is a slang term for superficial attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/marathi/features/the-english-we-speak/ep-151103 |title=The English We Speak |date=November 3, 2015 |work=BBC |accessdate=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 ''[[Boston Globe]]'' article about the potential for [[cheerleading]] at the Olympics, eye candy was used to describe cheerleaders as "entertainment popularized by professional sports in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Is cheerleading coming to the Olympics? |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2017/02/18/cheerleading-coming-olympics/13A4niz8VlbbE6O9enqYqO/story.html |newspaper=Boston Globe |date=February 18, 2017 |access-date=September 27, 2017 |first=Shira |last=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/columnists/ct-ryan-ending-nfl-cheerleaders-spt-0107-20160107-column.html |title=Time for NFL to end use of cheerleaders |date=January 7, 2016 |access-date=September 27, 2017|first=Shannon |last=Ryan |newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also been used in professional sports in the United States referring to female athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=It's Time For Sports Broadcasting To Stop Relegating Women to Sideline Eye Candy |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/annedoyle/2013/01/21/its-time-for-sports-broadcasting-to-stop-relegating-women-to-sideline-eye-candy/#4d6ef74e3fc9 |work=Forbes |date=January 21, 2017 |access-date=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''basing diagram''' shows or describes the “pins” of an [[electronic component]]. This part usually has more than two pins, so a basing diagram is needed to show which pin does what. Many basing diagrams also show [[dimension]]s.

In algebraic topology, the '''Bousfield class''' of, say, a [[spectrum (topology)|spectrum]] ''X'' is the set of all (say) spectra ''Y'' whose [[smash product]] with ''X'' is zero: &lt;math&gt;X \otimes Y = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Two objects are '''Bousfield equivalent''' if their Bousfield classes are the same.

The notion applies to [[module spectrum|module spectra]] and in that case one usually qualifies a ring spectrum over which the smash product is taken.

A '''capsule review''' is a form of criticism, usually associated with journalism, that offers a relatively short critique of a specified artistic work ([[movie]], [[music album]], [[restaurant]], [[painting]], etc.).  Capsule reviews generally appear in publications like newspapers and magazines, and can range anywhere from just a few sentences up to around 300 words.

''[[Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide]]'' is a famous publication that includes hundreds of capsule movie reviews by prolific film writer Leonard Maltin, including the world's shortest capsule review according to the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]'', a 2 out of 4 star review of the 1948 musical ''[[Isn't It Romantic? (1948 film)|Isn't It Romantic?]]'' that consisted of only the word "no".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4766">{{See also|Classification scheme (linguistics)|Classification scheme (metadata)}}
A '''classification scheme''' is the product of arranging things into kinds of things (classes) or into ''groups'' of classes.

In the abstract, the resulting structures are a crucial aspect of [[metadata]],  often represented as a hierarchical structure and accompanied by descriptive information of the classes or groups. Such a classification scheme is intended to be used for an arrangement or division of individual objects into the classes or groups, and the classes or groups are based on characteristics which the objects (members) have in common.

In [[linguistics]], [[subordinate]] concepts are described as [[hyponym]]s of their respective superordinates; typically, a hyponym is 'a kind of' its superordinate.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Allan (2002, p. 260), Natural language Semantics, Blackwell Publishers Ltd, Oxford, {{ISBN|0-631-19296-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ISO/IEC 11179]] metadata registry standard uses classification schemes as a way to classify administered items, such as [[data element]]s, in a [[metadata registry]].

Some quality criteria for classification schemes are:
* Whether different kinds are grouped together. In other words, whether it is a grouping system or a pure classification system. In case of grouping, a subset (subgroup) does not have (inherit) all the characteristics of the superset, which makes that the knowledge and requirements about the superset are not applicable for the members of the subset.
* Whether the classes have overlaps.
* Whether subordinates (may) have multiple superordinates. Some classification schemes allow that a kind of thing has more than one superordinate others don't. Multiple supertypes for one subtype implies that the subordinate has the combined characteristics of all its superordinates. This is called multiple inheritance (of characteristics from multiple superordinates to their subordinates).
* Whether the criteria for belonging to a class or group are well defined.
* Whether the kinds of relations between the concepts are made explicit and well defined.
* Whether subtype-supertype relations are distinguished from composition relations (part-whole relations) and from object-role relations.

==Benefits of using classification schemes==
Using one or more classification schemes for the classification of a collection of objects has many benefits.  Some of these include:
* It allows a user to find an individual object quickly on the basis of its kind or group.
* It makes it easier to detect duplicate objects.
* It conveys [[semantics]] (meaning) of an object from the definition of its kind, which meaning is not conveyed by the name of the individual object or its way of spelling.
* Knowledge and requirements about a kind of thing can be applied to the members of the kind.

==Kinds of classification schemes==
The following are examples of different kinds of classification schemes.  This list is in approximate order from informal to more formal:
* [[thesaurus]] - a collection of categorized concepts, denoted by words or phrases, that are related to each other by narrower term, wider term and related term relations.
* [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] - a formal list of concepts, denoted by controlled words or phrases, arranged from abstract to specific, related by subtype-supertype relations or by superset-subset relations.
* [[data model]] - an arrangement of concepts (entity types), denoted by words or phrases, that have various kinds of relationships. Typically, but not necessarily, representing requirements and capabilities for a specific scope (application area).
* [[network (mathematics)]] - an arrangement of objects in a random graph.
* [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] - an arrangement of concepts that are related by various well defined kinds of relations. The arrangement can be visualized in a [[directed acyclic graph]].

One example of a classification scheme for [[data element]]s is a [[representation term]].

'''Contour advection''' is a [[Lagrangian coordinates|Lagrangian method]] 
of simulating the evolution of one or more contours or isolines of
a tracer as it is stirred by a moving fluid.
Consider a blob of dye injected into a river or stream: to first order it could be modelled by tracking only the motion of its outlines. 
It is an excellent method for studying [[chaotic mixing]]:
even when advected by smooth or finitely-resolved velocity fields, 
through a continuous process of stretching and folding,
these contours often develop into intricate [[fractals]]. 
The [[flow tracer|tracer]] is typically passive as in &lt;ref name="Waugh_Plumb1994"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; representing a dynamical property of the fluid such as [[vorticity]].
At present, advection of contours is limited to two dimensions,
but generalizations to three dimensions are possible.

==Method==

First we need a set of points that accurately define the contour.
These points are [[advection|advected]] forward using a [[trajectory (meteorology)|trajectory]]
integration technique.
To maintain its integrity,
points must be added to or removed from the curve 
at regular intervals based on some criterion or metric.
The most obvious criterion is to maintain the distance between adjacent points
within a certain interval.
A better method is to use curvature since fewer points are required for
the same level of precision.
The [[curvature]] of a two-dimensional, Cartesian curve is given as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{r} = \sqrt{\left ( \frac{\mathrm d^2 x}{\mathrm d s^2}\right )^2 + 
              \left ( \frac{\mathrm d^2 y}{\mathrm d s^2} \right )^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of curvature 
and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the path.
We need to keep the fraction of arc traced out between two adjacent points,
&lt;math&gt;
r \Delta s
&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta s&lt;/math&gt; is the path difference between them,
roughly constant

In,&lt;ref name="Mills2009"&gt;{{Cite journal
 | author = Peter Mills

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
[[cubic spline]] fitting is used both to calculate the curvature
and interpolate new points into the contour.
The spline, which
is fitted [[parametric equation|parametrically]],
returns a set of second-order derivatives.

===Surgery===

A powerful refinement to the technique involves cutting out filaments that have become too
narrow to be significant.  
If the distance method of adding/removing points is used, 
then it is relatively straight forward 
to check the distances between all combinations of points.
If a distance between non-adjacent points is too small, 
then the two points are separated from their neighbours,
joined together and their neighbours joined also.
Points may then be removed if necessary.  
Once we allow surgery, we allow [[multiply connected]] domains inside the same contour.
A piece of the contour only one point in length would be removed from the simulation.
The most challenging part of the exercise is keeping track of all the points in order
to reduce the number of distance calculations---see [[nearest neighbour search]].
If the curvature method is used, 
then it may be difficult to recognize when two sections of the contour
are close enough to apply the surgery because of differing spacing
in strongly curved versus relatively straight sections.&lt;ref name="Dritschel1988"/&gt;

==Validation==

Advected contours, e.g. of trace gases (such as ozone) in the stratosphere,
can be validated with satellite remote sensing instruments using a method called [[isoline retrieval]].

{{short description|Method of capital punishment in which the victim is tied or nailed to a large wooden beam and left to hang until eventual death}}
[[File:Christ at the Cross - Cristo en la Cruz.jpg|thumb|''Christ at the Cross'' by [[Carl Bloch]], painting c. 1870]]
'''Crucifixion''' is a method of [[capital punishment]] in which the victim is tied or nailed to a large wooden beam and left to hang for several days until eventual death from exhaustion and [[asphyxiation]].&lt;ref name=josephus-jewishwars-5.11.1&gt;{{cite Josephus | PACEJ=1 | text=wars | bookno=5 | chap=11 | sec=1 |Perseus=1 | 1=J. | 2=BJ | 3=5.11.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Edwards |first1=William D. |title=On the Physical Death of Jesus Christ |journal=JAMA |date=March 21, 1986 |volume=255 |issue=11 |pages=1455 |doi=10.1001/jama.1986.03370110077025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Byard |first1=Roger W. |title=Forensic and historical aspects of crucifixion |journal=Forensic Science, Medicine, and Pathology |date=March 5, 2016 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=206–208 |doi=10.1007/s12024-016-9758-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[crucifixion of Jesus]] is a central narrative in [[Christianity]], and the [[Christian cross|cross]] (sometimes [[crucifix|depicting Jesus nailed onto it]]) is the main religious symbol for many Christian churches.

==Terminology==
{{further|Cross#Name}}
Ancient Greek has two verbs for crucify: ''ana-stauro'' (ἀνασταυρόω), from ''stauros'', "stake", and ''apo-tumpanizo'' (ἀποτυμπανίζω) "crucify on a plank",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da)potumpani%2Fzw&amp;highlight=crucify LSJ apotumpanizo] ἀποτυμπα^ν-ίζω (later ἀποτύμπα^ν-τυπ- UPZ119 (2nd century BC), POxy.1798.1.7), A. crucify on a plank, D.8.61,9.61:—Pass., Lys.13.56, D.19.137, Arist. Rh. 1383a5, Beros. ap. J.Ap.1.20. 2. generally, destroy, Plu.2.1049d.&lt;/ref&gt; together with ''anaskolopizo'' (ἀνασκολοπίζω "impale"). In earlier pre-Roman Greek texts ''anastauro'' usually means "impale".&lt;ref&gt;LSJ anastauro ἀνασταυρ-όω, = foreg., Hdt.3.125, 6.30, al.; identical with ἀνασκολοπίζω, 9.78:—Pass., Th. 1.110, Pl.Grg.473c. II. in Rom. times, affix to a cross, crucify, Plb. 1.11.5, al., Plu.Fab.6, al. 2. crucify afresh, Ep.Hebr.6.6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch Fabius Maximus 6.3 "Hannibal now perceived the mistake in his position, and its peril, and crucified the native guides who were responsible for it."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Polybius 1.11.5 [5] [https://archive.org/details/polybioyistoriai00polyuoft Historiae]. Polybius. Theodorus Büttner-Wobst after L. Dindorf. Leipzig. Teubner. 1893-.&lt;/ref&gt;

New Testament Greek uses four verbs, three of them based upon ''stauros'' (σταυρός), usually translated "cross". The most common term is ''stauroo'' (σταυρόω), "to crucify", occurring 43 times; ''sustauroo'' (συσταυρόω), "to crucify with" or "alongside" occurs five times, while ''anastauroo'' (ἀνασταυρόω), "to crucify again" occurs only once at the Epistle to the Hebrews 6:6. ''prospegnumi'' (προσπήγνυμι), "to fix or fasten to, impale, crucify" occurs only once at the Acts of the Apostles 2:23.

The English term ''[[cross]]'' derives from the Latin word ''crux''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cross |title=Online Etymology Dictionary, "cross" |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin term ''crux'' classically referred to a tree or any construction of wood used to hang criminals as a form of execution. The term later came to refer specifically to a cross.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dcrux Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'':] crux, ŭcis, f. (m., Enn. ap. Non. p. 195, 13; Gracch. ap. Fest. s. v. masculino, p. 150, 24, and 151, 12 Müll.) [perh. kindred with circus].

The English term ''[[crucifix]]'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''crucifixus'' or ''cruci fixus'', past participle passive of ''crucifigere'' or ''cruci figere'', meaning "to crucify" or "to fasten to a cross".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/crucify |title=Collins English Dictionary, "crucify" |publisher=Collins |date=31 December 2011 |accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/crucify?view=uk |title=Compact Oxford English Dictionary, "crucify" |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://websters.yourdictionary.com/crucify |title=Webster New World College Dictionary, "crucify" |work=yourdictionary.com/ |accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=crucify |title=Online Etymology Dictionary, "crucify"|publisher=Etymonline.com|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
[[File:Santo_Spirito,_sagrestia,_crocifisso_di_michelangelo_04.JPG|thumb|This crucifix is attributed to [[Michelangelo]], notable for showing naked crucifixion.]]
Crucifixion was most often performed to dissuade its witnesses from perpetrating similar (usually particularly heinous) crimes. Victims were sometimes left on display after death as a warning to any other potential criminals. Crucifixion was usually intended to provide a death that was particularly slow, painful (hence the term ''excruciating'', literally "out of crucifying"), gruesome, humiliating, and public, using whatever means were most expedient for that goal. Crucifixion methods varied considerably with location and time period.

The Greek and Latin words corresponding to "crucifixion" applied to many different forms of painful execution, including [[impalement|being impaled on a stake]], or affixed to a tree, upright pole (a [[crux simplex]]), or (most famous now) to a combination of an upright (in Latin, ''stipes'') and a crossbeam (in Latin, ''patibulum''). [[Seneca the Younger]] wrote: "I see crosses there, not just of one kind but made in many different ways: some have their victims with head down to the ground; some impale their private parts; others stretch out their arms on the gibbet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:www.thelatinlibrary.com/sen/sen.consolatione2.shtml+stipitem+patibulo|title=Dialogue "To Marcia on Consolation", 6.20.3 |publisher=[[The Latin Library]] |language=la|author=|date=|website=googleusercontent.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, the condemned was forced to carry the crossbeam to the place of execution.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Cross and Crucifixion |volume=7 |page=506 |first=Thomas Macall |last=Fallow |authorlink=Thomas Macall Fallow}}&lt;/ref&gt; A whole cross would weigh well over 135&amp;nbsp;kg (300&amp;nbsp;lb), but the crossbeam would not be quite as burdensome, weighing around 45&amp;nbsp;kg (100&amp;nbsp;lb).&lt;ref name=Mississippi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ball|first=DA|title=The crucifixion and death of a man called Jesus|journal=Journal of the Mississippi State Medical Association|year=1989|volume=30|issue=3|pages=77–83|pmid=2651675}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] records that the city of Rome had a specific place for carrying out executions, situated outside the [[Esquiline Gate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tacitus/tac.ann2.shtml#32 |title=Annales 2:32.2 |publisher=Thelatinlibrary.com |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had a specific area reserved for the execution of slaves by crucifixion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tacitus/tac.ann15.shtml#60 |title=Annales 15:60.1 |publisher=Thelatinlibrary.com |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upright posts would presumably be fixed permanently in that place, and the crossbeam, with the condemned person perhaps already nailed to it, would then be attached to the post.

The person executed may have been attached to the cross by rope, though nails and other sharp materials are mentioned in a passage by the Judean historian [[Josephus]], where he states that at the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)]], "the soldiers out of rage and hatred, ''nailed'' those they caught, one after one way, and another after another, to the crosses, by way of jest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flavius|first1=Josephus|title=Jewish War, Book V Chapter 11|url=http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/war-5.htm|publisher=ccel.org|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects used in the crucifixion of criminals, such as nails, were sought as [[amulets]] with perceived medicinal qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Mishna, Shabbath 6.10: see [https://books.google.com/books?id=EdbdQ-5fMr0C&amp;pg=PA182 David W. Chapman, ''Ancient Jewish and Christian Perceptions of Crucifixion''] (Mohn Siebeck 2008 {{ISBN|978-31-6149579-3}}), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

While a crucifixion was an execution, it was also a humiliation, by making the condemned as vulnerable as possible. Although artists have traditionally depicted the figure on a cross with a loin cloth or a covering of the genitals, the person being crucified was usually stripped naked. Writings by [[Seneca the Younger]] state some victims suffered a stick forced upwards through their groin.&lt;ref name="Seneca 1946"&gt;Seneca, Dialogue "To Marcia on Consolation", in ''Moral Essays'', 6.20.3, trans. John W. Basore, The Loeb Classical Library (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1946) 2:69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Of Consolation: To Marcia#XX.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its frequent use by the Romans, the horrors of crucifixion did not escape criticism by some eminent Roman orators.

The [[gibbet]] on which crucifixion was carried out could be of many shapes. [[Josephus]] describes several tortures and positions of crucifixion during the [[siege of Jerusalem (70)|Siege of Jerusalem]] as [[Titus]] crucified the rebels;&lt;ref name=josephus-jewishwars-5.11.1/&gt; and [[Seneca the Younger]] recounts: "I see crosses there, not just of one kind but made in many different ways: some have their victims with head down to the ground; some [[Impalement|impale]] their private parts; others stretch out their arms on the gibbet."&lt;ref name="Seneca 1946"/&gt;

At times the gibbet was only one vertical stake, called in Latin ''crux simplex''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bBOqGJc6tpcC&amp;pg=PA78 |first=William |last=Barclay |title=The Apostles' Creed |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-664-25826-9 |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the simplest available construction for torturing and killing the condemned. Frequently, however, there was a cross-piece attached either at the top to give the shape of a T (''crux commissa'') or just below the top, as in the form most familiar in Christian symbolism (''crux immissa'').&lt;ref&gt;"The&amp;nbsp;... oldest depiction of a crucifixion&amp;nbsp;... was uncovered by archaeologists more than a century ago on the [[Palatine Hill]] in Rome. It is a second-century [[graffiti]] scratched into a wall that was part of the imperial palace complex.

Bower, Jr. [http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/1991/9110fea1.asp "Cross or Torture Stake?"]&lt;/ref&gt; The most ancient image of a Roman crucifixion depicts an individual on a T-shaped cross. It is a graffito found in a taberna (hostel for wayfarers) in Puteoli, dating to the time of [[Trajan]] or [[Hadrian]] (late 1st century to early 2nd century AD).&lt;ref name="Cook"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cook|first=John Granger|year=2012|title=Crucifixion as Spectacle in Roman Campania|journal=Novum Testamentum|volume=54|issue=1|pages=60, 92–98|jstor=23253630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 2nd-century writers took it for granted that a crucified person's arms would be stretched out, not connected to a single stake: [[Lucian]] speaks of [[Prometheus]] as crucified "above the ravine with his hands outstretched" and explains that the letter T (the Greek letter [[tau]]) was looked upon as an unlucky letter or sign (similar to the way the number thirteen is looked upon today as an unlucky number), saying that the letter got its "evil significance" because of the "evil instrument" which had that shape, an instrument on which tyrants crucified people. [[Jehovah's Witness]]es argue that Jesus was crucified on a ''crux simplex'', and that the ''crux immissa'' was first used as a Christian symbol near the time of the supposed conversion of [[Constantine the Great|Emperor Constantine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why do Watch Tower publications show Jesus on a stake with hands over his head instead of on the traditional cross?|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1101989219|publisher=Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms were in the shape of the letters X and Y.

The New Testament writings about the crucifixion of Jesus do not speak specifically about the shape of that cross, but the early writings that do speak of its shape, from about the year AD 100 on, describe it as shaped like the letter T (the Greek letter tau)&lt;ref&gt;[[Epistle of Barnabas]], [[wikisource:Epistle of Barnabas#Chapter 9|Chapter 9]]. The document no doubt belongs to the end of the 1st or beginning of the 2nd century.[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/barnabas-intro.html]&lt;/ref&gt; or as composed of an upright and a transverse beam, sometimes with a small projection in the upright.&lt;ref&gt;"The very form of the cross, too, has five extremities, two in length, two in breadth, and one in the middle, on which [last] the person rests who is fixed by the nails" ([[Irenaeus]] (c. 130–202), ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus Haereses]]'' II, xxiv, 4 [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103224.htm]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin Martyr]] (c. 100–165) [[Dialogue with Trypho]] [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.iv.xc.html "Chapter XC – The stretched-out hands of Moses signified beforehand the cross"], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.iv.xci.html "Chapter XCI"] "For the one beam is placed upright, from which the highest extremity is raised up into a horn, when the other beam is fitted on to it, and the ends appear on both sides as horns joined on to the one horn." &lt;br&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.iv.cxi.html "Chapter CXI"] "stretching out his hands, remained till evening on the hill, his hands being supported; and this reveals a type of no other thing than of the cross"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nail placement===
[[File:CrucifixionSt.Matts.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Crucifixion window by [[Henry E. Sharp]], 1872, in [[St. Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church]], Charleston, South Carolina]]
In popular depictions of the crucifixion of Jesus (possibly because in translations of {{bibleverse||John|20:25}} the wounds are described as being "in his hands"), Jesus is shown with nails in his hands. But in Greek the word "χείρ", usually translated as "hand", could refer to the entire portion of the arm below the elbow,&lt;ref&gt;In the [[Homeric Greek]] of the [[Iliad]] XX, 478–480, a spear-point is said to have pierced the χεῖρ "where the sinews of the elbow join" (ἵνα τε ξενέχουσι τένοντες / ἀγκῶνος, τῇ τόν γε φίλης διὰ χειρὸς ἔπειρεν / αἰχμῇ χακλκείῃ).&lt;/ref&gt; and to denote the ''hand'' as distinct from the ''arm'' some other word could be added, as "ἄκρην οὔτασε χεῖρα" (he wounded the end of the χείρ, i.e., "he wounded her in the hand".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|xe/ir|χείρ|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A possibility that does not require tying is that the nails were inserted just above the wrist, between the two bones of the forearm (the [[radius (bone)|radius]] and the [[ulna]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Jonathan |last=Wynne-Jones |title=Why the BBC thinks Christ did not die this way |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/03/16/nrowan216.xml |work= |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=16 March 2008 |accessdate=2008-03-16 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An experiment that was the subject of a documentary on the [[National Geographic Channel]]'s ''Quest For Truth: The Crucifixion'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7291066/#storyContinued/ |title=a brief news article|publisher=MSNBC|date=2005-03-25|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that nailed feet provided enough support for the body, and that the hands could have been merely tied. Nailing the feet to the side of the cross relieves strain on the wrists by placing most of the weight on the lower body.

Another possibility, suggested by [[Frederick Zugibe]], is that the nails may have been driven in at an angle, entering in the palm in the crease that delineates the bulky region at the base of the thumb, and exiting in the wrist, passing through the [[carpal tunnel]].

A foot-rest (''suppedaneum'') attached to the cross, perhaps for the purpose of taking the person's weight off the wrists, is sometimes included in representations of the crucifixion of Jesus, but is not discussed in ancient sources. Some scholars interpret the [[Alexamenos graffito]], the earliest surviving depiction of the Crucifixion, as including such a foot-rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The beauty of the cross: the passion of Christ in theology and the arts, from the catacombs to the eve of the Renaissance |last=Viladesau |first=Richard|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-518811-0|oclc=58791208|page=21 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cTFh4tm9cMwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient sources also mention the ''sedile'', a small seat attached to the front of the cross, about halfway down,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=905&amp;letter=C|title=Crucifixion|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia|accessdate=2018-03-06|first1=Kaufmann|last1=Kohler|first2=Emil G.|last2=Hirsch}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could have served a similar purpose.

In 1968, archaeologists discovered at [[Giv'at ha-Mivtar]] in northeast [[Jerusalem]] the remains of one [[Jehohanan]], who had been crucified in the 1st century. The remains included a heel bone with a nail driven through it from the side. The tip of the nail was bent, perhaps because of striking a knot in the upright beam, which prevented it being extracted from the foot. A first inaccurate account of the length of the nail led some to believe that it had been driven through both heels, suggesting that the man had been placed in a sort of sidesaddle position, but the true length of the nail, 11.5&amp;nbsp;cm (4.53&amp;nbsp;inches), suggests instead that in this case of crucifixion the heels were nailed to opposite sides of the upright.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chesterrep.openrepository.com/cdr/bitstream/10034/40813/1/Some%20Notes%20on%20Crucifixion.pdf|title=Some Notes on Crucifixion|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-12-19|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20110718171841/http://chesterrep.openrepository.com/cdr/bitstream/10034/40813/1/Some%20Notes%20on%20Crucifixion.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EdbdQ-5fMr0C David W.

A theory attributed to [[Pierre Barbet (physician)|Pierre Barbet]] holds that, when the whole body weight was supported by the stretched arms, the typical cause of death was [[asphyxiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/augustine/arch/barbet.html|title=Columbia University page of Pierre Barbet on Crucifixion|author=|date=|website=columbia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that the condemned would have severe difficulty inhaling, due to hyper-expansion of the chest muscles and lungs. The condemned would therefore have to draw himself up by the arms, leading to [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]], or have his feet supported by tying or by a wood block. When no longer able to lift himself, the condemned would die within a few minutes. Some scholars, including [[Frederick Zugibe]], posit other causes of death. Zugibe suspended test subjects with their arms at 60° to 70° from the vertical. The test subjects had no difficulty breathing during experiments, but did suffer rapidly increasing pain,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Zugibe|first=Frederick T|authorlink=Frederick Zugibe|title=The cross and the shroud: a medical inquiry into the crucifixion|publisher=Paragon House|location=New York|year=1988|isbn=0-913729-75-2}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Zugibe, Frederick T. |title=The Crucifixion Of Jesus: A Forensic Inquiry |publisher=M.

However, Zugibe's positioning of the test subjects' feet is not supported by any archaeological or historical evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1420788|pmid=16574970|doi=10.1258/jrsm.99.4.185|volume=99|issue=4|title=Medical theories on the cause of death in crucifixion|year=2006|journal=J R Soc Med|pages=185–8|last1=Maslen|first1=MW|last2=Mitchell|first2=PD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Survival===
Since death does not follow immediately on crucifixion, survival after a short period of crucifixion is possible, as in the case of those who choose each year [[#As a devotional practice|as a devotional practice]] to be non-lethally crucified.

There is an ancient record of one person who survived a crucifixion that was intended to be lethal, but that was interrupted. [[Josephus]] recounts: "I saw many captives crucified, and remembered three of them as my former acquaintance. I was very sorry at this in my mind, and went with tears in my eyes to [[Titus]], and told him of them; so he immediately commanded them to be taken down, and to have the greatest care taken of them, in order to their recovery; yet two of them died under the physician's hands, while the third recovered."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/autobiog.htm The Life Of Flavius Josephus], 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus gives no details of the method or duration of the crucifixion of his three friends before their reprieve.

==Archaeological evidence==
Although the ancient Jewish historian Josephus, as well as other sources,{{which|date=June 2015}} refers to the crucifixion of thousands of people by the Romans, there is only a single archaeological discovery of a [[Jehohanan|crucified body]] dating back to the Roman Empire around the time of Jesus. This was discovered at [[Givat HaMivtar]], Jerusalem in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Tzaferis, V. 1970 Jewish Tombs at and near Giv'at ha-Mivtar. Israel Exploration Journal Vol. 20 pp. 18-32.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not necessarily surprising that there is only one such discovery, because a crucified body was usually left to decay on the cross and therefore would not be preserved. The only reason these archaeological remains were preserved was because family members gave this particular individual a customary burial.

The remains were found accidentally in an [[ossuary]] with the crucified man's name on it, '[[Jehohanan]], the son of Hagakol'.&lt;ref&gt;Haas, Nicu.

Maier|publisher=Google Books|isbn=978-0-8254-3329-0|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicu Haas, an anthropologist at the Hebrew University Medical School in Jerusalem, examined the ossuary and discovered that it contained a heel bone with a nail driven through its side, indicating that the man had been crucified. The position of the nail relative to the bone indicates that the feet had been nailed to the cross from their side, not from their front; various opinions have been proposed as to whether they were both nailed together to the front of the cross or one on the left side, one on the right side. The point of the nail had olive wood fragments on it indicating that he was crucified on a cross made of olive wood or on an olive tree.

Additionally, a piece of acacia wood was located between the bones and the head of the nail, presumably to keep the condemned from freeing his foot by sliding it over the nail. His legs were found broken, possibly to hasten his death. It is thought that because in Roman times iron was rare, the nails were removed from the dead body to conserve costs. According to Haas, this could help to explain why only one nail has been found, as the tip of the nail in question was bent in such a way that it could not be removed.

Haas had also identified a scratch on the inner surface of the right radius bone of the forearm, close to the wrist. He deduced from the form of the scratch, as well as from the intact wrist bones, that a nail had been driven into the forearm at that position. However, many of Haas' findings have been challenged. For instance, it was subsequently determined that the scratches in the wrist area were non-traumatic – and, therefore, not evidence of crucifixion – while reexamination of the heel bone revealed that the two heels were not nailed together, but rather separately to either side of the upright post of the cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authors=Zias J. &amp; Sekeles, E. |year=1985 |title=The Crucified Man from Giv'at ha-Mivtar: A Reappraisal. |journal=Israel Exploration Journal |issue=35 |pages=22–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and religious texts==
===Pre-Roman states===
Crucifixion (or impalement), in one form or another, was used by [[Achaemenid Persia|Persians]], [[Carthaginians]], and [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]].

The Greeks were generally opposed to performing crucifixions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/LX/Stavros.html Stavros, Scolops (σταῦρός, σκόλοψ). The cross;] encyclopedia Hellinica&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his ''Histories'', ix.120–122, the Greek writer [[Herodotus]] describes the execution of a Persian general at the hands of Athenians in about 479 BC: "They nailed him to a plank and hung him up&amp;nbsp;... this [[Artayctes]] who suffered death by crucifixion."&lt;ref&gt;Translation by Aubrey de Selincourt. The original, "σανίδα προσπασσαλεύσαντες, ἀνεκρέμασαν&amp;nbsp;... Τούτου δὲ τοῦ Ἀρταύκτεω τοῦ ἀνακρεμασθέντος&amp;nbsp;...", is translated by Henry Cary (Bohn's Classical Library: ''Herodotus Literally Translated''. London, G. Bell and Sons 1917, pp.&amp;nbsp;591–592) as: "They nailed him to a plank and hoisted him aloft&amp;nbsp;... this Artayctes who was hoisted aloft".&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Commentary on Herodotus'' by How and Wells remarks: "They crucified him with hands and feet stretched out and nailed to cross-pieces; cf. vii.33. This barbarity, unusual on the part of Greeks, may be explained by the enormity of the outrage or by Athenian deference to local feeling."&lt;ref&gt;W.W. How and J. Wells, ''A Commentary on Herodotus'' (Clarendon Press, Oxford 1912), vol. 2, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christian [[theologian]]s, beginning with [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] [[Tarsus (city)|of Tarsus]] writing in [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] {{bibleverse-nb||Gal|3:13}}, have interpreted an allusion to crucifixion in [[Deuteronomy]] {{bibleverse-nb||Deut|21:22-23}}. This reference is to being hanged from a tree, and may be associated with [[lynching]] or traditional hanging. However, Rabbinic law limited capital punishment to just 4 methods of execution: stoning, burning, strangulation, and decapitation, while the passage in Deuteronomy was interpreted as an obligation to hang the corpse on a tree as a form of deterrence.&lt;ref&gt;See Mishnah, Sanhedrin 7:1, translated in Jacob Neusner, The Mishnah: A New Translation 591 (1988), supra note 8, at 595-96 (indicating that court ordered execution by stoning, burning, decapitation, or strangulation only)&lt;/ref&gt; The fragmentary Aramaic Testament of Levi (DSS 4Q541) interprets in column 6: "God ... (partially legible)-''will set'' ... right errors. ... (partially legible)-''He will judge'' ... revealed sins. Investigate and seek and know how Jonah wept. Thus, you shall not destroy the weak by wasting away or by ... (partially legible)-''crucifixion'' ... Let not the nail touch him."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/scrolls_deadsea/uncovered/uncovered05.htm Levi,''Aramaic Testament of Levi'' 4Q541 column 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander the Great]] is reputed to have crucified 2,000 survivors from his [[Siege of Tyre (332 BC)|siege]] of the [[Phoenicia]]n city of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander_t09.html Quintus Curtius Rufus, ''History of Alexander the Great of Macedonia'' 4.4.21]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the doctor who unsuccessfully treated Alexander's friend [[Hephaestion]]. Some historians have also conjectured that Alexander crucified [[Callisthenes]], his official historian and biographer, for objecting to Alexander's adoption of the Persian ceremony of [[Proskynesis|royal adoration]].

The oldest crucifixion may be a post-mortem one mentioned by [[Herodotus]]. [[Polycrates]], the tyrant of [[Samos]], was put to death in 522 B.C. by Persians, and his dead body was then crucified.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''Histories'', {{Herodotus|en|3|125}} ("Having killed him in some way not fit to be told, Oroetes then crucified him")&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Rome===

==== History ====
The hypothesis that the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] custom of crucifixion may have developed out of a primitive custom of ''arbori suspendere''—hanging on an ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#arbor felix|arbor infelix]]'' ("inauspicious tree") dedicated to the gods of the nether world—is rejected by William A. Oldfather, who shows that this form of execution (the ''supplicium more maiorum'', punishment in accordance with the custom of our ancestors) consisted of suspending someone from a tree, not dedicated to any particular gods, and flogging him to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/journals/TAPA/39/Supplicium_de_More_Maiorum*.html|title=Livy I.26 and the Supplicium de More Maiorum|publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tertullian]] mentions a 1st-century AD case in which trees were used for crucifixion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grtbooks.com/exitfram.asp?idx=3&amp;yr=200&amp;aa=AA&amp;at=AA&amp;ref=tertullian&amp;URL=http://www.tertullian.org/latin/apologeticus.htm |title=''Apologia'', IX, 1 |publisher=Grtbooks.com|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Seneca the Younger]] earlier used the phrase ''infelix lignum'' (unfortunate wood) for the transom ("patibulum") or the whole cross.&lt;ref&gt;After quoting a poem by [[Maecenas]] that speaks of preferring life to death even when life is burdened with all the disadvantages of old age or even with acute torture ("vel acuta si sedeam cruce"), Seneca disagrees with the sentiment, saying death would be better for a crucified person hanging from the patibulum: "I should deem him most despicable had he wished to live to the point of crucifixion&amp;nbsp;... Is it worth so much to weigh down upon one's own wound, and hang stretched out from a patibulum?&amp;nbsp;... Is anyone found who, after being fastened to that accursed wood, already weakened, already deformed, swelling with ugly weals on shoulders and chest, with many reasons for dying even before getting to the cross, would wish to prolong a life-breath that is about to experience so many torments?" ("Contemptissimum putarem, si vivere vellet usque ad crucem&amp;nbsp;... Est tanti vulnus suum premere et patibulo pendere districtum&amp;nbsp;... Invenitur, qui velit adactus ad illud infelix lignum, iam debilis, iam pravus et in foedum scapularum ac pectoris tuber elisus, cui multae moriendi causae etiam citra crucem fuerant, trahere animam tot tormenta tracturam?" - [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/sen/seneca.ep17-18.shtml Letter 101, 12-14])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plautus]] and [[Plutarch]] are the two main sources for accounts of criminals carrying their own patibula to the upright ''stipes''.&lt;ref&gt;Titus Maccius Plautus ''Miles gloriosus'' Mason Hammond, Arthur M. Mack - 1997 Page 109, "The patibulum (in the next line) was a crossbar which the convicted criminal carried on his shoulders, with his arms fastened to it, to the place for&amp;nbsp;... Hoisted up on an upright post, the patibulum became the crossbar of the cross"&lt;/ref&gt;

Notorious mass crucifixions followed the [[Third Servile War]] in 73–71 BC (the slave rebellion under [[Spartacus]]), other [[Roman civil wars]] in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, and the [[destruction of Jerusalem]] in AD 70. [[Crassus]] crucified 6,000 of Spartacus' followers hunted down and captured after his defeat in battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#120|title=Appian • The Civil Wars — Book I|author=|date=|website=penelope.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus tells a story of the Romans crucifying people along the walls of Jerusalem. He also says that the Roman soldiers would amuse themselves by crucifying criminals in different positions.

[[Constantine I|Constantine the Great]], the first Christian [[Roman Empire|emperor]], abolished crucifixion in the Roman Empire in 337 out of veneration for [[Jesus Christ]], its most famous victim.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9028045|title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online: crucifixion|author=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Britannica.com|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GGJmFIf6mtIC Dictionary of Images and Symbols in Counselling By William Stewart] 1998 {{ISBN|1-85302-351-5}}, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bible-archaeology.info/crucifixion.htm|title=Archaeology of the Bible|publisher=Bible-archaeology.info|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Process ====
Crucifixion was typically carried out by specialized teams, consisting of a commanding [[centurion]] and his soldiers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; First, the condemned would be stripped naked&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Doctor at Calvary: The Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ as Described by a Surgeon|last=Barbet|first=P|publisher=Doubleday Image Books|year=1953|isbn=|location=New York|pages=46–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[flagellation|scourged.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This would cause the person to lose a large amount of blood, and approach a state of [[shock (circulatory)|shock]]. The convict then usually had to carry the horizontal beam (''patibulum'' in [[Latin]]) to the place of execution, but not necessarily the whole cross.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the death march, the prisoner, probably&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cross and Crucifixion|volume=7|page=506|first=Thomas Macall|last=Fallow|authorlink=Thomas Macall Fallow}} Macall believes that the person would be given back his or her clothing following the scourging.&lt;/ref&gt; still [[nude]] after the scourging,&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; would be led through the most crowded streets&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cojs.org/joe-zias-crucifixion-in-antiquity-the-anthropological-evidence/|title=Crucifixion in Antiquity: The Anthropological Evidence|last=Zias|first=Joseph|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310074322/http://cojs.org/joe-zias-crucifixion-in-antiquity-the-anthropological-evidence/|archive-date=2018-03-10|dead-url=yes|access-date=March 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; bearing a ''titulus'' — a sign board proclaiming the prisoner's name and crime.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Upon arrival at the place of execution, selected to be especially public,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.joezias.com:80/MelGibsonControversy.htm|title=Postscript - The Mel Gibson Controversy|last=Zias|first=Joseph|date=|website=JoeZias.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040306140009/http://www.joezias.com:80/MelGibsonControversy.htm|archive-date=2004-03-06|dead-url=yes|access-date=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the convict would be stripped of any remaining clothing, then nailed to the cross naked.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; If the crucifixion took place in an established place of execution, the vertical beam (''stipes'') might be permanently embedded in the ground.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this case, the condemned person's wrists would first be nailed to the ''patibulum'', and then he or she would be hoisted off the ground with ropes to hang from the elevated ''patibulum'' while it was fastened to the ''stipes''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Next the feet or ankles would be nailed to the upright stake.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The 'nails' were tapered iron spikes approximately {{convert|5|to|7|in|cm}} long, with a square shaft {{convert|3/8|in|mm|0}} across.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The ''titulus'' would also be fastened to the cross to notify onlookers of the person's name and crime as they hung on the cross, further maximizing the public impact.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There may have been considerable variation in the position in which prisoners were nailed to their crosses and how their bodies were supported while they died.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; [[Seneca the Younger]] recounts: "I see crosses there, not just of one kind but made in many different ways: some have their victims with head down to the ground; some [[Impalement|impale]] their private parts; others stretch out their arms on the gibbet."&lt;ref name="Seneca 1946" /&gt; One source claims that for Jews (apparently not for others), a man would be crucified with his back to the cross as is traditionally depicted, while a woman would be nailed facing her cross, probably with her back to onlookers, or at least with the ''stipes'' providing some semblance of [[modesty]] if viewed from the front.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Such concessions were "unique" and not made outside a Jewish context.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Several sources mention some sort of seat fastened to the ''stipes'' to help support the person's body,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Justin Martyr ''Dialogue with Trypho, a Jew'' 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus ''Against Heresies'' II.24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian ''To the Nations'' I.12&lt;/ref&gt; thereby prolonging the person's [[suffering]]&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and humiliation&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; by preventing the [[asphyxia]]tion caused by hanging without support. Justin Martyr calls the seat a ''cornu'', or "horn,"&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; leading some scholars to believe it may have had a pointed shape designed to torment the crucified person.&lt;ref&gt;Barbet, 45; Zugibe, 57; Vassilios Tzaferis, “Crucifixion—The Archaeological Evidence,” ''Biblical Archaeology Review'' 11.1 (Jan./Feb. 1985), 44-53 (p. 49)&lt;/ref&gt; This would be consistent with Seneca's observation of victims with their private parts impaled.

In Roman-style crucifixion, the condemned could take up to a few days to die, but death was sometimes hastened by human action. "The attending Roman guards could leave the site only after the victim had died, and were known to precipitate death by means of deliberate fracturing of the tibia and/or fibula, spear stab wounds into the heart, sharp blows to the front of the chest, or a smoking fire built at the foot of the cross to asphyxiate the victim."&lt;ref name="patho" /&gt; The Romans sometimes broke the prisoner's legs to hasten death and usually forbade burial.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; On the other hand, the person was often deliberately kept alive as long as possible to prolong their suffering and humiliation, so as to provide the maximum deterrent effect.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Corpses of the crucified were typically left on the crosses to decompose and be eaten by animals.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How Jesus became God: The exaltation of a Jewish preacher from Galilee|last1=Ehrman|first1=Bart D.|date=2014|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0061778186|edition=First|location=New York, NY|pages=133–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crucifixion was introduced into [[Japan]] during the [[Sengoku period]] (1467–1573), after a 350-year period with no capital punishment.&lt;ref name=JapaneseMind&gt;{{cite book|title=The Japanese mind: essentials of Japanese philosophy and culture|last=Moore |first=Charles Alexander|author2=Aldyth V.

Known in Japanese as {{Nihongo|''haritsuke''|磔}}, crucifixion was used in Japan before and during the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]]. Several related crucifixion techniques were used. Petra Schmidt, in "Capital Punishment in Japan", writes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Capital Punishment in Japan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8fZKH4cbcmQC|last=Schmidt|first=Petra|year=2002|publisher=BRILL|location=Leiden|isbn=978-90-04-12421-9|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Execution by crucifixion included, first of all, ''hikimawashi'' (i.e, being paraded about town on horseback); then the unfortunate was tied to a cross made from one vertical and two horizontal poles. The cross was raised, the convict speared several times from two sides, and eventually killed with a final thrust through the throat. The corpse was left on the cross for three days. If one condemned to crucifixion died in prison, his body was pickled and the punishment executed on the dead body. Under [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], one of the great 16th-century unifiers, crucifixion upside down (i.e, ''sakasaharitsuke'') was frequently used. Water crucifixion (''mizuharitsuke'') awaited mostly Christians: a cross was raised at low tide; when the high tide came, the convict was submerged under water up to the head, prolonging death for many days}}

[[File:ChristianMartyrsOfNagasaki.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Twenty Six Martyrs of Japan]]
In 1597 [[Twenty-six Martyrs of Japan|twenty-six]] [[Christian]] Martyrs were nailed to crosses at [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], Japan. Among those executed were Saints [[Paulo Miki]], [[Philip of Jesus]] and [[Pedro Bautista]], a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Franciscan]] who had worked about ten years in the [[Philippines]]. The executions marked the beginning of a long history of [[Japanese Martyrs|persecution of Christianity in Japan]], which continued until its decriminalization in 1871.

Crucifixion was used as a punishment for prisoners of war during [[World War II]]. [[Ringer Edwards]], an Australian prisoner of war, was crucified for killing cattle, along with two others. He survived 63 hours before being let down.

In [[Burma]], crucifixion was a central element in several execution rituals. Felix Carey, a missionary in Burma from 1806 to 1812,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baptist.org.uk/Groups/220248/Latest_News.aspx|title=The Baptist Union: Latest News|author=|date=|website=baptist.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Baptist Magazine, Volume 7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kEwEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA67|work=Baptist Magazine|year=1815|publisher=Button&amp;son|location=London|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|Four or five persons, after being nailed through their hands and feet to a scaffold, had first their tongues cut out, then their mouths slit open from ear to ear, then their ears cut off, and finally their bellies ripped open.

Six people were crucified in the following manner: their hands and feet nailed to a scaffold; then their eyes were extracted with a blunt hook; and in this condition they were left to expire; two died in the course of four days; the rest were liberated, but died of mortification on the sixth or seventh day.

Four persons were crucified, viz. not nailed but tied with their hands and feet stretched out at full length, in an erect posture. In this posture they were to remain till death; every thing they wished to eat was ordered them with a view to prolong their lives and misery. In cases like this, the legs and feet of the criminals begin to swell and mortify at the expiration of three or four days; some are said to live in this state for a fortnight, and expire at last from fatigue and mortification. Those which I saw, were liberated at the end of three or four days.}}

During [[World War I]], there were persistent rumors that German soldiers [[the Crucified Soldier|had crucified a Canadian soldier]] on a tree or barn door with [[bayonet]]s or combat knives. The event was initially reported in 1915 by Private George Barrie of the [[1st Canadian Division]]. Two investigations, one a post-war official investigation, and the other an independent investigation by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], concluded that there was no evidence to support the story.&lt;ref name=PotJ&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prisoners of the Japanese: literary imagination and the prisoner-of-war experience|last=Bourke|first=Roger|year=2006 |publisher=University of Queensland Press|isbn=978-0-7022-3564-1|oclc=70257905|page=184 n.8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JpKAYepQJN4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, British documentary maker [[Iain Overton]] in 2001 published an article claiming that the story was true, identifying the soldier as [[Harry Band]].&lt;ref name=PotJ/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Iain|last=Overton|title=Revealed, the soldier who was crucified by Germans|publisher=International Express|date=2001-04-17|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overton's article was the basis for a 2002 episode of the [[Channel 4]] documentary show ''[[Secret History (television documentary series)|Secret History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Crucified Soldier|episodelink=The Crucified Soldier|series=Secret History|serieslink=Secret History (TV documentary series)|network=[[Channel 4]]|airdate=2002-07-04|season=9|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Church]] frowns upon self-crucifixion as a form of devotion: "Penitential practices leading to self-crucifixion with nails are not to be encouraged."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20020513_vers-direttorio_en.html Directory on Popular Piety 144] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623013300/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20020513_vers-direttorio_en.html|date=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the practice is not unknown.

In the [[Philippines]], some Catholics are [[Crucifixion in the Philippines|voluntarily, non-lethally crucified]] for a limited time on [[Good Friday]] to imitate the sufferings of Christ. Pre-sterilised nails are driven through the palm of the hand between the bones, while there is a footrest to which the feet are nailed.

In other cases, a crucifixion is only simulated within a [[passion play]], as in the ceremonial re-enactment that has been performed yearly in the town of [[Passion Play of Iztapalapa|Iztapalapa]], on the outskirts of [[Mexico City]], since 1833,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=23257|title=Religion-Mexico: The Passion According to Iztapalapa|publisher=IPS News|accessdate=2009-12-19|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20091226173652/http://www.ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=23257|archivedate=2009-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the more famous [[Oberammergau Passion Play]]. Also, since at least the mid-19th century, a group of [[flagellants]] in [[New Mexico]], called ''Hermanos de Luz'' ("Brothers of Light"), have annually conducted reenactments of Christ's crucifixion during [[Holy Week]], in which a penitent is tied—but not nailed—to a cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aragon |first1=Ray John De |title=The Penitentes of New Mexico: Hermanos de la Luz |date=2006 |publisher=Sunstone Press |isbn=9780865345041 |page=58 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=noimuXOCtFgC&amp;pg=pa58 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous crucifixions==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2018}}
*The rebel slaves of the [[Third Servile War]]: Between 73 BC and 71 BC a band of slaves, eventually numbering about 120,000, under the (at least partial) leadership of [[Spartacus]] were in open revolt against the [[Roman republic]]. The rebellion was eventually crushed and, while Spartacus himself most likely died in the final battle of the revolt, approximately 6,000 of his followers were crucified along the 200&amp;nbsp;km [[Appian Way]] between Capua and Rome as a warning to any other would-be rebels.
* [[Jehohanan]]: Jewish man who was crucified around the same time as Jesus of Nazareth and it is widely accepted that his ankles were nailed to the side of the ''stipes'' of the cross 
*[[Jesus of Nazareth]]: his [[crucifixion of Jesus|death by crucifixion]] under [[Pontius Pilate]] (c. AD 30 or 33), recounted in the four 1st-century canonical [[Gospel]]s, is referred to repeatedly as something well known in the earlier letters of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]], for instance, five times in his First Letter to the Corinthians, written in 57 AD (1:13, 1:18, 1:23, 2:2, 2:8). Pilate was the Roman governor of [[Iudaea province]] at the time, and he is explicitly linked with the condemnation of Jesus not only by the Gospels but also by [[Tacitus]],&lt;ref&gt;''Annals'', 15.44.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Responsibility for the death of Jesus]] for details). The civil charge was a claim to be [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]].
*[[Saint Peter]]: Christian apostle, who according to tradition was crucified upside-down at his own request (hence the [[Cross of St. Peter]]), because he did not feel worthy enough to die the same way as Jesus.
*[[Saint Andrew]]: Christian apostle and [[Saint Peter]]'s brother, who is traditionally said to have been crucified on an X-shaped cross (hence the [[Saltire|St. Andrew's Cross]]).
*[[Simeon of Jerusalem]]: second [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem#Bishops of Jerusalem|Bishop of Jerusalem]], crucified in either 106 or 107.

{{Marxism|expanded=Sociology}}
In  [[Marxist philosophy]], '''cultural hegemony''' is the [[Dominance hierarchy|domination]] of a culturally diverse society by the [[ruling class]] who manipulate the culture of that society—the [[belief]]s, [[explanation]]s, [[perception]]s, [[Value system|values]], and [[mores]]—so that their imposed, ruling-class [[worldview]] becomes the accepted cultural [[norm (sociology)|norm]]; the universally valid [[dominant ideology]], which justifies the social, political, and economic ''[[status quo]]'' as natural and inevitable, perpetual and beneficial for everyone, rather than as artificial [[Social constructionism|social constructs]] that benefit only the ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;Bullock, Alan; Trombley, Stephen, Editors (1999), ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' Third Edition, pp. 387–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "TheColumbia"&gt;''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Fifth Edition. (1994), p. 1215.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]] and in [[sociology]], the term ''cultural hegemony'' has denotations and connotations derived from the Ancient Greek word ''ἡγεμονία (hegemonia)'' indicating leadership and rule. In politics, [[hegemony]] is the geopolitical method of indirect [[Empire|imperial]] dominance, with which the ''hegemon'' (leader state) rules subordinate states, by the threat of intervention, an implied means of [[Power (philosophy)|power]], rather than by direct military force, that is, [[invasion]], [[Military occupation|occupation]], and [[annexation]].&lt;ref&gt;Ross Hassig, ''Mexico and the Spanish Conquest'' (1994), pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Etymology===
The etymologic and historical evolution of the Greek word ''ἡγεμονία'', and of its denotations, has proceeded thus:

* In [[Ancient Greece]] (8th c. BC – AD 6th c.), ''ἡγεμονία'' (leadership) denoted the politico–military dominance of a [[city-state]] upon other city-states, as in the [[League of Corinth|Hellenic League]] (338 BC), a [[federation]] of Greek city–states, established by King [[Philip II of Macedon]], to facilitate his access to and use of the Greek militaries against the [[Persian empire]].&lt;ref name="TheColumbia" /&gt;
* In the 19th century, ''hegemony'' (rule) denoted the [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] and cultural predominance of one country upon other countries, as in the [[European colonialism]] imposed upon the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australia.{{Sfn | Bullock | Trombley | 1999 | pp = 387–88}}
* In the 20th century, the political-science denotation of ''hegemony'' (dominance) expanded to include [[cultural imperialism]]; the cultural domination, by a [[ruling class]], of a socially [[Social stratification|stratified]] society. That by manipulating the [[dominant ideology]] (cultural values and mores) of the society, the ruling class can intellectually dominate the other social classes with an imposed [[worldview]] (''Weltanschauung'') that ideologically justifies the social, political, and economic ''status quo'' of the society as if it were a natural and normal, inevitable and perpetual state of affairs that always has been so.&lt;ref name="TheColumbia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clive Upton, William A. Kretzschmar, Rafal Konopka: ''Oxford Dictionary of Pronunciation for Current English''. Oxford University Press (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.flagrancy.net/timeline.html|title=US Hegemony|publisher=Flagrancy|contribution = Timeline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
In 1848, [[Karl Marx]] proposed that the [[economic recession]]s and practical contradictions of a capitalist economy would provoke the [[working class]] to [[proletarian revolution]], depose [[capitalism]], restructure social institutions (economic, political, social) per the rational models of [[socialism]], and thus begin the transition to a [[communist]] society.  Therefore, the [[dialectics|dialectical]] changes to the functioning of the [[economy]] of a society determine its social [[Base and superstructure|superstructures]] (culture and politics).

To that end, Antonio Gramsci proposed a ''strategic distinction'', between a War of Position and a War of Manœuvre. The war of position is an intellectual and cultural struggle wherein the [[anti-capitalist]] revolutionary creates a [[proletarian culture]] whose native value system counters the cultural hegemony of the [[bourgeoisie]]. The proletarian culture will increase [[class consciousness]], teach [[revolution]]ary theory and historical analysis, and thus propagate further revolutionary organisation among the social classes. On winning the war of position, socialist leaders would then have the necessary political power and popular support to begin the political [[maneuver warfare|manœuvre warfare]] of [[revolutionary socialism]].

The initial, theoretical application of cultural domination was as a Marxist analysis of "economic class" ([[base and superstructure]]), which Antonio Gramsci developed to comprehend "social class"; hence, cultural hegemony proposes that the prevailing cultural norms of a society, which are imposed by the ruling class ([[bourgeoisie|bourgeois cultural hegemony]]), must not be perceived as natural and inevitable, but must be recognized as artificial [[social construct]]s ([[institutions]], [[convention (norm)|practices]], [[beliefs]], et cetera) that must be investigated to discover their philosophic roots as instruments of social-class domination. That such praxis of knowledge is indispensable for the intellectual and political [[liberty|liberation]] of the [[proletariat]], so that workers and peasants, the people of town and country, can create their own [[working-class culture]], which specifically addresses their social and economic needs as social classes.

In a society, cultural hegemony is neither monolithic intellectual praxis, nor a unified system of values, but a complex of [[Social stratification|stratified]] [[social structure]]s, wherein each social and economic class has a social purpose and an internal class-logic that allows its members to behave in a way that is particular and different from the behaviours of the members of other social classes, whilst co-existing with them as constituents of the society.

As a result of their different social purposes, the classes will be able to coalesce into a [[society]] with a greater social mission. When a man, a woman, or a child perceives the social structures of bourgeois cultural hegemony, personal [[common sense]] performs a dual, structural role (private and public) whereby the individual person applies common sense to cope with daily life, which explains (to himself and to herself) the small segment of the [[social order]] stratum that each experiences as the ''status quo'' of life in society; "the way things are". Publicly, the emergence of the perceptual limitations of personal common sense inhibit the individual person’s perception of the greater nature of the systematic socio-economic [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]] made possible by cultural hegemony. Because of the discrepancy in perceiving the ''status quo''—the socio-economic hierarchy of bourgeois culture—most men and women concern themselves with their immediate (private) personal concerns, rather than with distant (public) concerns, and so do not think about and question the fundamental sources of their socio-economic [[oppression]], and its discontents, social, personal, and political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1177/019685998601000203 |format= [[PDF]] |title= The Problem of Ideology — Marxism without Guarantees |year= 1986 |first= Stuart |last= Hall |authorlink= Stuart Hall (cultural theorist) |journal= Journal of Communication Inquiry |volume= 10 |issue= 2 |pages= 28–44 |url= http://www.ram-wan.net/restrepo/hall/The%20problem%20of%20ideology.pdf }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of cultural hegemony are perceptible at the personal level; although each person in a society lives a meaningful life in his and her social class, to him and to her, the discrete social classes might appear to have little in common with the private life of the individual man and woman. Yet, when perceived as a whole society, the life of each person does contribute to the greater social hegemony. Although social diversity, economic variety, and political freedom appear to exist—because most people ''see'' different life-circumstances—they are incapable of perceiving the greater hegemonic pattern created when the lives they witness coalesce as a society. The cultural hegemony is manifested in and maintained by an existence of minor, different circumstances that are not always fully perceived by the men and the women living the culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Antonio |last=Gramsci |authorlink=Antonio Gramsci |editor-first =Joseph A | editor-last = Buttigieg |title=Prison Notebooks |publisher= Columbia University Press |location=New York City |year=1992 |pages=233–38 |isbn=0-231-10592-4 |oclc=24009547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectuals==
In perceiving and combating cultural hegemony, the working class and the peasantry depend upon the intellectuals produced by their society, to which ends Antonio Gramsci distinguished between bourgeois-class intellectuals and working-class intellectuals, the proponents and the opponents of the imposed, normative culture, and thus of the social ''[[status quo]]'':

{{Quotation| Since these various categories of traditional [[intellectual]]s [administrators, [[scholar]]s and [[scientist]]s, theorists, non-ecclesiastical philosophers, etc.] experience through an ''esprit de corps'' their uninterrupted historical continuity, and their special qualifications, they thus put themselves forward as autonomous and independent of the [[Ruling class|dominant social group]]. This self-assessment is not without consequences in the [[Ideology|ideological]] and [[Politics|political]] fields, consequences of wide-ranging import. The whole of [[Idealism|idealist philosophy]] can easily be connected with this position, assumed by the social complex of intellectuals, and can be defined as the expression of that social utopia by which the intellectuals think of themselves as "independent" [and] autonomous, [and] endowed with a character of their own, etc.|''Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci'' (1971), pp. 7–8.&lt;ref&gt;''Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci'' (1971), Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell Smith, eds., pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quotation| The traditional and vulgarized type of the intellectual is given by the Man of Letters, the [[philosopher]], and the [[artist]]. Therefore, journalists, who claim to be men of letters, philosophers, artists, also regard themselves as the "true" intellectuals. In the modern world, [[technical education]], closely bound to industrial labor, even at the most primitive and unqualified level, must form the basis of the new type of intellectual. ...

The mode of being of the new intellectual can no longer consist of eloquence, which is an exterior and momentary mover of feelings and passions, but in active participation in practical life, as constructor [and] organizer, as "permanent persuader", not just simple orator.|''Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci'' (1971), pp. 9–10.&lt;ref&gt;''Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci'' (1971), Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell Smith, eds., pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Gramsci’s influence==
[[File:Rudi.jpg|thumb|right|300px|In the 1960s, the German student leader [[Rudi Dutschke]], of the ''[[German student movement|68er-Bewegung]]'', said that changing the bourgeois West Germany required a long march through the society’s institutions, in order to identify and combat cultural hegemony. This quote is often mis-attributed to Antonio Gramsci.&lt;ref name=JaButt&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buttigieg|first1=J. A.|title=The Contemporary Discourse on Civil Society: A Gramscian Critique|journal=boundary 2|date=1 March 2005|volume=32|issue=1|pages=33–52|doi=10.1215/01903659-32-1-33}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Cultural hegemony has philosophically influenced [[Eurocommunism]], the [[social sciences]], and the [[activist]] politics of socially [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Progressivism|progressive]] politicians. The analytic [[discourse]] of cultural hegemony is important to research and synthesis in [[anthropology]], political science, sociology, and [[cultural studies]]; in [[education]], cultural hegemony developed [[critical pedagogy]], by which the root causes of political and social discontent can be identified, and so resolved.

In 1967, the [[German student movement]] leader [[Rudi Dutschke]] reformulated Antonio Gramsci's philosophy of cultural hegemony with the phrase ''[[The long march through the institutions]]'' (German: ''Marsch durch die Institutionen'') to identify the political war of position, an allusion to the [[Long March]] (1934–35) of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Chinese]] [[People's Liberation Army]], by means of which, the working class would produce their own organic intellectuals and culture ([[dominant ideology]]) to replace those imposed by the [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://english.nd.edu/faculty/profiles/joseph-a-buttigieg/ | editor1-first = Joseph A | editor1-last = Buttigieg | edition = English critical | last = Gramsci | title = Prison Notebooks | at = p 50 footnote 21 | quote = Long March Through the Institutions&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100616163619/http://english.nd.edu/faculty/profiles/joseph-a-buttigieg/ | archivedate = 2010-06-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1215/01903659-32-1-33| issn = 0190-3659| volume = 32| issue = 1| pages = 33–52| last = Buttigieg| first = Joseph A.| title = The Contemporary Discourse on Civil Society: A Gramscian Critique| journal = Boundary 2| accessdate = 2010-06-30| year = 2005| url = http://boundary2.dukejournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/32/1/33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "davidson"&gt;{{Citation | format = web log | url = http://carldavidson.blogspot.com/2006/04/strategy-hegemony-long-march.html | title = Strategy, Hegemony &amp; ‘The Long March’: Gramsci’s Lessons for the Antiwar Movement | first = Carl | last = Davidson | date = 6 April 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Marsch durch die Institutionen|Marsch durch die Institutionen]] at German Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[wikiquote:Antonio Gramsci#Misattributed|Antonio Gramsci: Misattributed]] at English Wikiquote for the origin of “The Long March Through the Institutions” quotation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique of Gramsci==

===The ideological apparatuses of the State===
As conceptual criticism of cultural hegemony, the [[structuralism|structuralist]] philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] presented the theory of the [[Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses|ideological state apparatus]] to describe the structure of complex relationships, among the different organs of the State, by which ideology is transmitted and disseminated to the populations of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On The Reproduction of Capitalism|last=Althusser|first=Louis|publisher=Verso|year=2014|isbn=9781781681640|location=London/ New York|pages=74–75; 103–47; 177, 180, 198–206; 218–31; 242–6.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Althusser draws from the concepts of hegemony present in ''cultural hegemony'', yet rejects the absolute [[historicism]] proposed by Gramsci. He argues that the ideological state apparatuses (ISA) are the sites of ideological conflict among the social classes of a society. That, in contrast to the repressive state apparatuses (RSA), such as the military and the police forces, the ISA exist as a plurality. While the ruling class in power can readily control the repressive state apparatuses, the ISA are both the sites and the stakes (the objects) of class struggle. Moreover, the ISA are not monolithic social entities, and are distributed throughout the society, as public and as private sites of continual [[class struggle]].

In ''On the Reproduction of Capitalism'' (1968), Louis Althusser said that the ideological apparatuses of the State are over-determined zones of society that comprise complex elements of the ideologies of previous [[modes of production]], thus, are sites of continual political activity in a society, which are&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Reproduction of Capitalism|last=Althusser|first=Louis|publisher=Verso|year=2014|isbn=9781781681640|location=London/ New York|page=243.}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

* the religious ISA (the system of Churches)
 
* the educational ISA (the systems of public and private schools),
 
* the family ISA,
 
* the legal ISA,
 
* the political ISA (the political system, e.g. political parties),
 
* the trade union ISA,
 
* the communications ISA (press, radio, television, etc.)
 
* the cultural ISA (literature, the arts, sport, etc.)

Althusser said that the [[parliament]]ary structures of the State, by which the “will of the people” is represented by elected delegates, are an ideological apparatus of the State. That the political system, itself, is an ideological apparatus, because it involves the “fiction, corresponding to a ‘certain’ reality, that the component parts of the [political] system, as well as the principle of its functioning, are based on the ideology of the ‘freedom’ and ‘equality’ of the individual voters and the ‘free choice’ of the people’s representatives, by the individuals that ‘make up’ the people.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Reproduction of Capitalism|last=Althusser|first=Louis|publisher=Verso|year=2014|location=London/New York|pages=222–223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''cycle of violence''' refers to repeated and dangerous acts of [[violence]]  as a cyclical pattern,&lt;ref name=HELP&gt;[http://helpguide.org/mental/domestic_violence_abuse_types_signs_causes_effects.htm#cycle ''The cycle of violence.''] Domestic Violence and Abuse,

It often refers to violent behavior learned as a child, and then repeated as an adult, therefore continuing on in a perceived cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, A. A. (2005). The Relationship Between Adolescent Physical Abuse and Criminal Offending: Support for an Enduring and Generalized Cycle of Violence. ''Journal of Family Violence.'' 20(5):279-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Within a relationship==

A cycle of abuse generally follows the following pattern:&lt;ref name=HELP/&gt; 
* [[Abuse]] &amp;ndash; The abuser initiates aggressive, [[verbal abuse|verbal]] or [[physical abuse]], designed to [[Abusive power and control|control]] and oppress the victim.
* [[Guilt (emotion)|Guilt]] &amp;ndash; The abuser feels guilty for inflicting abusive behavior, primarily out of a concern of being found guilty of abuse rather than feelings of sympathy for the victim.
* [[Rationalization (making excuses)|Excuses &amp;ndash; Rationalization]] of the behavior, including [[blame]] and excuses.
* "Normal" behavior &amp;ndash; The abuser regains personal control, creates a peaceful phase in an attempt to make the victim feel in the relationship.
* [[Fantasy (psychology)|Fantasy]] and planning &amp;ndash; thinking of what the victim has done wrong, how they will be punished, and developing a plan to realize the fantasy.
* Set-up &amp;ndash; the plan is "put in motion."

A cyclical nature of domestic violence is most prevalent in intimate terrorism (IT), which involve a pattern of ongoing [[Abusive power and control|control]] using emotional, physical and other forms of domestic violence and is what generally leads victims, who are most often women, to [[women's shelter]]s.  It is what was traditionally the definition of domestic violence and is generally illustrated with the "Power and Control Wheel"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncdsv.org/images/PowerControlwheelNOSHADING.pdf ''Power and Control Wheel,''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027084459/http://www.ncdsv.org/images/PowerControlwheelNOSHADING.pdf |date=2011-10-27 }} National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence. Retrieved November 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; to illustrate the different and inter-related forms of abuse.

==Intergenerational==
[[Intergenerational]] cycles of violence occur when violence is passed from parent to child, or sibling to sibling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abusivelove.com/abuse_types_1_11.htm Intergenerational Cycle Of Abuse] AbusiveLove.com. Retrieved November 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Children exposed to domestic violence are likely to develop [[Behaviorism|behavioral]] problems, such as [[Regression (psychology)|regressing]], exhibiting out of control behavior,&lt;ref name=acadv&gt;[http://www.acadv.org/children.html ''The Effects of Domestic Violence on Children.''] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021103134717/http://www.acadv.org/children.html |date=2002-11-03 }} Alabama Coalition Against Domestic Violence.&lt;/ref&gt;  and imitating behaviors.

An estimated 1/5 to 1/3 of teenagers subject to viewing domestic violence situations experience [[teen dating violence]], regularly abusing or being abused by their partners verbally, mentally, emotionally, sexually and/or physically. Thirty to 50% of dating relationships can exhibit the same cycle of escalating violence in their marital relationships.&lt;ref name=SASS&gt;[http://www.sassnh.org/ ''Sexual Assault Survivor Services''] (SASS) Facts about domestic violence. (1996)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Physical punishment]] of children has also been linked to later [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gershoff, E.T. |date=2008 |title=Report on Physical Punishment in the United States: What Research Tells Us About Its Effects on Children |format=PDF |location=Columbus, OH |publisher=Center for Effective Discipline |page=16 |url=http://www.phoenixchildrens.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/principles_and_practices-of_effective_discipline.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family violence researcher [[Murray A. Straus]] believes that disciplinary [[spanking]] forms "the most prevalent and important form of violence in American families", whose effects contribute to several major societal problems, including later assaults on spouses.&lt;ref&gt;Straus, Murray A. (2000). [http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CP62.pdf "Corporal punishment by parents: The cradle of violence in the family and society" (PDF).] ''Virginia Journal of Social Policy and the Law''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==

Arab philosopher [[Ibn Khaldun]] in 1377 identified a cycle of violence in which successive [[dynasties]] take control of a state and establish [[asabiyyah]] or social cohesion, enabling them to expand to the limit. Excess 'pomp' causes the dynasty then to stagnate, become sedentary and collapse, giving way to conquest by a new, more ruthless dynasty. This cycle plays out over the course of three generations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], ''[[The Muqadimmah]]'', Routledge, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[John J. Mearsheimer]] the cycle of violence between nations will continue indefinitely because the [[Great powers]] fear each other, thus compete for power and dominance, in the belief that this will ensure safety.&lt;ref&gt;[[John J. Mearsheimer]], ''[[The Tragedy of Great Power Politics]]'', WW Norton, 2003, Preface&lt;/ref&gt;

'Cycle of violence' is also used more generally to describe any long-term factional dispute within a nation in which [[tit-for-tat]] acts of aggression occur frequently, as for example in  [[Argentina]] in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ervin Staub]],
''The Roots of Evil'', Cambridge UP, 1989, p281&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Lebanon]] and [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronnie Miller, ''From Lebanon to Intifada'', University Press of America, 1991, p104&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3924">In the field of [[simulation]], a [[discrete time|discrete]]-rate simulation (DRS) models the behavior of mixed discrete and continuous systems. This methodology is used to simulate linear continuous systems, hybrid continuous and discrete-event systems, and any other system that involves the rate-based movement or flow of material from one location to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc08papers/089.pdf | title = Discrete Rate Simulation Using Linear Programming | accessdate = 2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of application ==

Industrial areas where DRS is used include: [[bulk material handling]] (e.g. minerals and ores, powders, particles, mixed wastes, wood chips), liquids and gases, pulp, oil and gas pipelines, traffic, and high speed/volume [[production lines]] in the food &amp; beverage, consumer products, and pharmaceutical industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc97papers/0706.PDF | title = Simulation of Bulk Flow and High Speed Operations | accessdate = 2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://informs-sim.org/wsc13papers/includes/files/102.pdf | title = Simulation of Mixed Discrete and Continuous Systems: an Iron Ore Example | accessdate = 2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compared to discrete-event and continuous simulation ==

DRS combines the event-based timing of [[Discrete event simulation|discrete-event simulation]](DES) and the continuous variables calculations found in [[continuous simulation]]. It predicts and schedules events when the system needs to calculate a new set of rates and determines the appropriate rate of flow for each branch or stream.

[[File:A comparison between discrete rate, continuous, and discrete event simulation.gif|thumb|A comparison between discrete rate, continuous, and discrete event simulation]]
DRS is similar to DES in that both methodologies model the operation of the system as a discrete [[sequence of events]] in time. However, while DES assumes there is no change in the system between consecutive events, in a DRS model the flow continues to move at a constant rate such that, for example, the level in a tank could change. Another difference is that DES models are overwhelmingly concerned with the status of system entities (discrete objects moving through the system) while DRS models are concerned with the status (quantity and location) of homogeneous flow. For rate-based systems, DRS has faster computational times and is more accurate in calculating mass balance compared to DES.

DRS is also similar to continuous simulation in that it simulates homogeneous flow. In addition, both methods recalculate flow rates, which are continuous variables, whenever a state change occurs. However, DRS differs from continuous simulation in that it is event-based and does not simulate every time slice. Modeling linear flow systems using continuous simulation has limitations because it usually is unable to detect important events, such as a tank becoming full or empty, until after the event has occurred plus requires many more system recalculations during the course of the simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc09papers/031.pdf | title = ExtendSim Advanced Technology: Discrete Rate Simulation | accessdate = 2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==

An exercise in learning how to build discrete-rate simulations is to model a tank filling and emptying over time. The tank fills at a constant rate and empties at two different rates, one rate until it is full and a faster rate until it is empty. There are 4 types of events in the simulation: start simulation, storage full, storage empty, and end simulation. At each event the model determines which emptying rate to use; between events the emptying rate remains constant.

{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2012}}
In [[computer science]], '''evolutionary computation''' is a family of [[algorithm]]s for [[global optimization]] inspired by [[biological evolution]], and the subfield of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[soft computing]] studying these algorithms. In technical terms, they are a family of population-based [[trial and error]] problem solvers with a [[metaheuristic]] or [[stochastic optimization]] character.

In evolutionary computation, an initial set of candidate solutions is generated and iteratively updated. Each new generation is produced by stochastically removing less desired solutions, and introducing small random changes. In biological terminology, a [[population]] of solutions is subjected to [[natural selection]] (or [[artificial selection]]) and [[mutation]]. As a result, the population will gradually [[evolution|evolve]] to increase in [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], in this case the chosen [[fitness function]] of the algorithm.

Evolutionary computation techniques can produce highly optimized solutions in a wide range of problem settings, making them popular in [[computer science]]. Many variants and extensions exist, suited to more specific families of problems and data structures. Evolutionary computation is also sometimes used in [[evolutionary biology]] as an ''in silico'' experimental procedure to study common aspects of general evolutionary processes.

== History ==
The use of evolutionary principles for automated problem solving originated in the 1950s. It was not until the 1960s that three distinct interpretations of this idea started to be developed in three different places.

''[[Evolutionary programming]]'' was introduced by [[Lawrence J. Fogel]] in the US, while [[John Henry Holland]] called his method a ''[[genetic algorithm]]''. In Germany [[Ingo Rechenberg]] and [[Hans-Paul Schwefel]] introduced ''[[Evolution strategy|evolution strategies]]''. These areas developed separately for about 15 years. From the early nineties on they are unified as different representatives ("dialects") of one technology, called ''evolutionary computing''. Also in the early nineties, a fourth stream following the general ideas had emerged – ''[[genetic programming]]''. Since the 1990s, nature-inspired algorithms are becoming an increasingly significant part of the evolutionary computation.

These terminologies denote the field of evolutionary computing and consider evolutionary programming, evolution strategies, genetic algorithms, and genetic programming as sub-areas.

Simulations of [[evolution]] using [[evolutionary algorithm]]s and [[artificial life]] started with the work of Nils Aall Barricelli in the 1960s, and was extended by [[Alex Fraser (scientist)|Alex Fraser]], who published a series of papers on simulation of [[artificial selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fraser AS |title=Monte Carlo analyses of genetic models |journal=Nature |volume=181 |issue=4603 |pages=208–9 |year=1958 |pmid=13504138 |doi=10.1038/181208a0 |ref=harv|bibcode=1958Natur.181..208F }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evolutionary algorithm|Artificial evolution]] became a widely recognised optimisation method as a result of the work of [[Ingo Rechenberg]] in the 1960s and early 1970s, who used [[Evolution strategy|evolution strategies]] to solve complex engineering problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rechenberg |first=Ingo |year=1973 |title=Evolutionsstrategie&amp;nbsp;– Optimierung technischer Systeme nach Prinzipien der biologischen Evolution (PhD thesis) |publisher=Fromman-Holzboog|language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genetic algorithm]]s in particular became popular through the writing of [[John Henry Holland|John Holland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holland |first=John H. |year=1975 |title=Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|isbn = 0-262-58111-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As academic interest grew, dramatic increases in the power of computers allowed practical applications, including the automatic evolution of computer programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koza|first=John R. |year=1992 |title=Genetic Programming: On the Programming of Computers by Means of Natural Selection|publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=0-262-11170-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi-dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers, and also to optimise the design of systems.&lt;ref&gt;G.

== Techniques ==
Evolutionary computing techniques mostly involve [[metaheuristic]] [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]] [[algorithm]]s. Broadly speaking, the field includes:

*[[Ant colony optimization]]
*[[Artificial immune system]]s
*[[Artificial life]] (also see [[digital organism]])
*[[Cultural algorithm]]s
*[[Differential evolution]]
*[[Dual-phase evolution]]
*[[Estimation of distribution algorithm]]s

== Evolutionary algorithms ==
{{Main article|Evolutionary algorithm}}
[[Evolutionary algorithms]] form a subset of evolutionary computation in that they generally only involve techniques implementing mechanisms inspired by [[biological evolution]] such as [[reproduction]], [[mutation]], [[Genetic recombination|recombination]], [[natural selection]] and [[survival of the fittest]]. [[Candidate solutions]] to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the [[Loss function|cost function]] determines the environment within which the solutions "live" (see also [[fitness function]]). [[Evolution]] of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.

In this process, there are two main forces that form the basis of evolutionary systems:  '''Recombination''' and '''mutation''' create the necessary diversity and thereby facilitate novelty, while '''selection''' acts as a force increasing quality.

Many aspects of such an evolutionary process are [[stochastic]]. Changed pieces of information due to recombination and mutation are randomly chosen. On the other hand, selection operators can be either deterministic, or stochastic. In the latter case, individuals with a higher [[Fitness function|fitness]] have a higher chance to be selected than individuals with a lower [[Fitness function|fitness]], but typically even the weak individuals have a chance to become a parent or to survive.

== Evolutionary algorithms and biology ==
{{Main article|Evolutionary algorithm}}

[[Genetic algorithms]] deliver methods to model [[biological systems]] and [[systems biology]] that are linked to the theory of [[dynamical systems]], since they are used to predict the future states of the system. This is just a vivid (but perhaps misleading) way of drawing attention to the orderly, well-controlled and highly structured character of development in biology.

However, the use of algorithms and informatics, in particular of [[computational theory]], beyond the analogy to dynamical systems, is also relevant to understand evolution itself. 

This view has the merit of recognizing that there is no central control of development; organisms develop as a result of local interactions within and between cells. The most promising ideas about program-development parallels seem to us to be ones that point to an apparently close analogy between processes within cells, and the low-level operation of modern computers &lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/information-biological/#InfEvo &lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, biological systems are like computational machines that process input information to compute next states, such that biological systems are closer to a computation than classical dynamical system &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= J.G. Diaz Ochoa |title= Elastic Multi-scale Mechanisms: Computation and Biological Evolution |journal=[[Journal of Molecular Evolution]] |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=47–57 |year=2018 |pmid=29248946 |doi=10.1007/s00239-017-9823-7 |ref=harv|bibcode=2018JMolE..86...47D }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Furthermore, following concepts from [[computational theory]], micro processes in biological organisms are fundamentally incomplete and undecidable ([[completeness (logic)]]), implying that “there is more than a crude metaphor behind the analogy between cells and computers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= A. Danchin |title= Bacteria as computers making computers |journal=[[FEMS Microbiol. Rev.]] |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=3–26 |year=2008 |pmid=29248946 |doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2008.00137.x |ref=harv|bibcode= |pmc=2704931 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The analogy to computation extends also to the relationship between [[inheritance systems]] and biological structure, which is often thought to reveal one of the most pressing problems in explaining the origins of life.

{{Fiji Expeditions}}

The '''First Fiji Expedition''' undertaken by the [[United States]] occurred in October 1855 during the [[civil war]] on the islands. In response to the alleged [[arson]] attacks on the American [[commercial agent]] in [[Lautoka]], [[Viti Levu]], the navy sent a warship to demand compensation for the attack from [[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]], the [[Vunivalu of Bau]] and self-proclaimed [[Tui Viti]] (King of Fiji).&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title=Casualties: U.

==Expedition==
The first incident that led to the American expedition was in 1849 when the house owned by agent [[John Brown Williams]] was hit by [[cannon]] fire and burned. The Fijians were allegedly celebrating [[Fiji Day|Independence Day]]{{Clarify|date=January 2017}} when cannonballs fell on the building. The second incident happened the same year as the expedition when, again, fire was to interrupt John Williams's duties. After another accidental fire on [[Nukulau]] destroyed his store and some Fijians looted it. {{USS|John Adams|1799|2}}, under [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] [[Edward B. Boutwell]], was sent to monitor the unrest in October and her crew were landed on more than one occasion to protect American interests. When Commander Boutwell heard of the incidents involving William's house and store, he demanded [[United States dollar|US$]]5,000 in compensation from King Cakobau. This initial claim was supplemented by further claims totalling $45,000. The natives received a deadline saying if they failed to pay, a landing party of [[United States Marine Corps|marine]]s and [[United States Navy|sailor]]s would be sent ashore to capture the king in the island's village. Fijian [[warrior]]s put up some resistance and one American service man was killed and two were wounded. Ultimately the men of ''John Adams'' were successful in routing a contingent of natives from Lautoka but Cakobau and the survivors escaped capture.

Cakobau's claim to be King of Fiji was by no means universally recognized by his fellow-[[ratu|chiefs]], who jealously guarded the independence of their fiefdoms. His dilemma was that if he acknowledged the debt, he did not have sufficient funds to pay it, but that if he disclaimed it by saying that it fell under the jurisdiction of another chief, he would jeopardize his claim to the kingship, which he wanted foreign powers to recognize. He decided to bide his time, hoping that the Americans were only bluffing.

A second [[Second Fiji Expedition|expedition]] in 1858, involving the crew of {{USS|Vandalia|1828|2}}, achieved clearer results but in the end, Cakobau never paid the debt.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref name=State/&gt;&lt;ref name=cooney&gt;{{cite book| title=A Chronology of the U.

The '''fog of war''' ({{lang-de|links=no|Nebel des Krieges}}) is the [[uncertainty]] in [[situational awareness]] experienced by participants in  [[military operations]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joint Service Command and Staff College]], Advanced Command and Staff Course Notes dated 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The term seeks to capture the uncertainty regarding one's own capability, adversary capability, and adversary [[Intent (Military)|intent]] during an engagement, operation, or campaign. Military forces try to reduce the fog of war through [[military intelligence]] and friendly force tracking systems. The term is also used to define uncertainty mechanics in [[war gaming|wargames]].

== Origin ==
The word "fog" in reference to uncertainty in war was introduced by the [[Prussia]]n military analyst [[Carl von Clausewitz]] in his posthumously published book, ''[[On War|Vom Kriege]]'' (1832), which appeared in English translation in 1873 under the title ''On War'':

{{quote|War is the realm of uncertainty; three quarters of the factors on which action in war is based are wrapped in a fog of greater or lesser uncertainty. A sensitive and discriminating judgment is called for; a skilled intelligence to scent out the truth.|Carl von Clausewitz&lt;ref&gt;Carl von Clausewitz, ''[http://slantchev.ucsd.edu/courses/ps143a/readings/Clausewitz%20-%20On%20War,%20Books%201%20and%208.pdf Vom Kriege]'', Book 1, Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It has been pointed out that von Clausewitz does not use the exact phrase "fog of war," using multiple similar metaphors such as "twilight" and "moonlight" to describe lack of clarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=On War Without the Fog| url=http://www.clausewitz.com/bibl/Kiesling-OnFog.pdf| author=Eugenia C. Kiesling| date=2001| publisher=Military Review| accessdate=2014-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1896 when the exact phrase "fog of war" was used in text, described as "the state of ignorance in which commanders frequently find themselves as regards the real strength and position, not only of their foes, but also of their friends."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Fog_of_War_by_Colonel_Lonsdale_Hale.html?id=zvlLMwEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y “The fog of war”], by Col. Lonsdale Hale, Royal Engineers (retired), Aldershot Military Academy, March 24, 1896.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military ==
{{expand section|date=November 2014}}
The fog of war is a reality in all military conflict. Precision and certainty are unattainable goals, but modern military doctrine suggests a trade off of precision and certainty for speed and agility. Militaries employ [[command and control]] (C2) systems and doctrine to partially alleviate the fog of war.

The term also applies to the experience of individual soldiers in battle: often cited is the pure confusion of direction, location, and perspective on a battlefield. Officers and soldiers become separated, orders become confused and subject to revision with poor communication. Sounds and vision are limited from the perspective of the individual and may not be easily resolved, resulting in a continuing uncertainty, a perceptual "fog".

The fog of war has been decreasing as [[intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance]] technology is improving. In 2016, [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]] Gen. [[Mark A. Milley]] stated that "On the future [[battlefield]], if you stay in one place longer than two or three hours, you will be dead..With enemy drones and sensors constantly on the hunt for targets, there won’t even be time for four hours’ unbroken sleep."&lt;ref&gt;https://breakingdefense.com/2016/10/miserable-disobedient-victorious-gen-milleys-future-us-soldier/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Simulations and games ==
[[File:Richard III from Columbia Games.jpg|thumb|A [[block wargame]], Richard III by [[Columbia Games]], showing the fog of war in play.]]
Abstract and military [[board game]]s sometimes try to capture the effect of the fog of war by hiding the identity of playing pieces, by keeping them face down or turned away from the opposing player (as in ''[[Stratego]]'') or covered (as in ''[[Squad Leader]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Squad Leader Rulebook'', 4th Edition, section 25.0.&lt;/ref&gt;). Other games, such as the ''[[Kriegspiel (chess)|Kriegspiel]]'' chess-[[Chess variants#Chess with incomplete information and/or elements of chance|variant]], playing pieces could be hidden from the players by using a duplicate, hidden game board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.com/incinf.dir/kriegspiel.html  Kriegspiel] by Hans L. Bodlaender.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another version of fog of war emulation is used by [[Block wargame|block wargaming]] where, much like ''Stratego'', the blocks face each player, hiding their value. However, this also allows for incremental damage, where the block is rotated up to four times to indicate battle damage before the unit is eliminated from the playing field.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Solitaire games also by their nature attempt to recreate fog of war using random dice rolls or card draws to determine events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lewis| last=Pulsipher |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CmUY_RCnwgIC&amp;pg=PA227#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date=2012 |title=Game Design: How to Create Video and Tabletop Games, Start to Finish |work=McFarland |page= 227|isbn=0-786-46952-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complex double-blind [[miniature wargame]]s, including [[military simulation]]s, may make use of two identical maps or model landscapes, one or more referees providing limited intelligence to the opposing sides, participants in the roles of sub-unit leaders, and the use of radio sets or intercoms.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

=== In video games ===
[[File:Freeciv-net-screenshot-2011-06-23.png|thumb|In the computer game ''[[Freeciv]]'', completely unexplored areas are fully black, while currently unobserved areas are covered in a grey shroud.]]
A computer's ability to effectively hide information from a player is seen as a distinct advantage over board games when simulating war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine  |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1984&amp;pub=2&amp;id=15 |title=Carrier Force: The Fog of War at its Foggiest |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |date=April 1984 |volume=4 |number=2 |pages=22, 47 |accessdate=2017-03-15 |editor-first1=Russell |editor-last1=Sipe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fog of war in [[strategy video game]]s refers to enemy units, and often terrain, being hidden from the player; this is lifted once the area is explored, but the information is often fully or partially re-hidden whenever the player does not have a unit in that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Adams |first=Ernest |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lm1jAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA510#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Fundamentals of Game Design |publisher=[[New Riders Press]] |date=2014 |edition=3 |isbn=978-0-321-92967-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest use of fog of war was in the 1977 game ''[[Classic Empire|Empire]]'' by [[Walter Bright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher George |last=Lewin |title=War Games and their History |chapter=8 |publisher=Fonthill Media |location=Stroud, Great Britain |date=2012 |isbn=978-1-78155-042-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early use of fog of war was the 1978 game ''[[Tanktics]]'' designed by [[Chris Crawford (game designer)|Chris Crawford]], which was criticized for its unreliable and "confusing" fog of war system.&lt;ref name="proctor198201"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Proctor |first=Bob |date=January 1982 |title=Tanktics: Review and Analysis |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1982&amp;pub=2&amp;id=2 |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |pages=17-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford in 1982 suggested "limit[ing] the amount of information available to the human player" to compensate for the computer's lack of intelligence.&lt;ref name="crawford198212"&gt;{{cite magazine | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1982-12/1982_12_BYTE_07-12_Game_Plan_1982#page/n97/mode/2up | title=Design Techniques and Ideas for Computer Games | magazine=BYTE | date=December 1982 | accessdate=19 October 2013 |last=Crawford |first=Chris | pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1988 ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' article [[Dave Arneson]] called fog of war "one of the biggest 'plus' factors in computer simulations", while Crawford concluded, using ''Tanktics'' as an example, that video game fog of war systems became less "fun" the more realistic they were, leading the medium to instead use simplified systems.&lt;ref name="CGW"&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=April 1988 |title="Fog of War": A Clearer View |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1988&amp;pub=2&amp;id=46 |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |pages=24–26, 52–53 |access-date=2017-03-15 |number=46 |editor-first1=Russell |editor-last1=Sipe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two large [[Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard]] franchises, ''[[Warcraft]]'' and ''[[StarCraft]]'', use a fog of war which only reveals terrain features and enemy units through a player's [[reconnaissance]]. Without a unit actively observing, previously revealed areas of the map are subject to a shroud through which only terrain is visible, but changes in enemy units or bases are not.&lt;ref name="StarCraft"&gt;{{cite web |title=StarCraft's Steps |url=http://www.howell.seattle.wa.us/ggggd/StarcraftsSteps.pdf |first=Dave |last=Howell |date=2010 |accessdate=2014-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110101417/http://www.howell.seattle.wa.us/ggggd/StarcraftsSteps.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also common in both turn-based and real-time strategy games, such as the [[Total War (series) | ''Total War'' series]], [[Age of Empires (series)|''Age of Empires'' series]], [[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert series|''Red Alert'' series]], [[Wars (series)|''Advance Wars'' series]], [[Fire Emblem (series)|''Fire Emblem'' series]] and [[Sid Meier]]'s [[Civilization (series)|''Civilization'' series]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Fog of war gives players an incentive to uncover a game's world. A compulsion to reveal obscured parts of a map has been described to give a sense of exploring the unknown.&lt;ref name="gamechurch"&gt;{{cite web |title=Power, Knowledge and the Fog of War |url=http://gamechurch.com/power-knowledge-and-the-fog-of-war/ |first=Jonah |last=Stowe |work=[[Gamechurch]] |accessdate=2014-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford said that "reasonable" uses of fog of war, such as needing to send out scouts, "not only seem natural, but ... add to the realism and excitement of the game"{{r|crawford198212}} ''[[Merchant Prince]]'' displays over unexplored territory what ''Computer Gaming World'' described as a "[[Here be dragons|renaissance-style map of dubious accuracy]]".&lt;ref name="carter199404"&gt;{{Cite magazine

''Fudge'' has been nominated for an [[Origins Award]] for ''Best Role-Playing Game System'' for the ''[[Deryni]] Role-Playing Game''.&lt;ref name="origins2005"&gt;{{cite press release| title =Academy announces Origins Award Nominations| publisher =Game Manufacturers Association| date =2006-03-15| url =http://gama.org/news-articles/academy-announces-origins-award-nominations#OX4-IMw6yIaqKiqvrHst1Q| accessdate =2007-09-24  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deryni"&gt;{{Cite web| title =FUDGE Deryni Adventure Game| date =2006-03-17| url =http://derynirealms.com/| accessdate = 2007-09-24  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than being a rigidly pre-defined set of rules like ''[[d20 System]]'' or ''[[GURPS]]'', ''Fudge'' offers a customizable toolkit for building the users' own specialized [[role-playing game system]].  Such things as what attributes and skills will define characters are left to be determined by the [[Game Master]] and players, and several different optional systems for resolving actions and conflicts are offered. ''Fudge'' is not tied to any particular [[genre]] or setting and world builders are encouraged to invent appropriate attributes and rules tailored to the campaign.&lt;ref name="fudgerules"&gt;{{Cite web| last =Kitkowski| first =Andrew| title =FUDGE Expanded Edition: Playtest Review| date =2000-11-14| url =http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/reviews/rev_3576.html| accessdate = 2007-09-24  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The project that would lead to ''Fudge'' was first proposed by [[Steffan O'Sullivan]] in November 1992 on the rec.games.design newsgroup,&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.design/msg/4dc266facabc766f net.rpg.freeform 1 of 2]&lt;/ref&gt; and over the following months that online community would contribute to the directed project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.design/msg/03ec8dc478bdc253 net.rpg.freeform 2 of 2]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest stipulations of O'Sullivan was that the basic system would always remain free to the public over the internet, and the [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] of the 1995 version still is.&lt;ref name="desnotes"&gt;[http://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/fud-des.html Fudge Designer's notes]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1995 version of ''Fudge'' is available under a non-commercial licence.

[[Grey Ghost Press]], with the endorsement of Steffan O'Sullivan, publishes an expanded form of the ''Fudge'' system. There have been three Grey Ghost Press editions, the most current being the ''Fudge 10th Anniversary Edition'', which includes several suggested rules systems for common RPG elements and an example basic fantasy "build" of the game.

In March 2004, Grey Ghost Press acquired the copyright of ''Fudge'', and on April 6, 2005, they released a version of ''Fudge'' under the [[Open Game License]].

The OGL license has allowed the ''[[FATE (role-playing game system)|FATE role-playing game system]]'' to build on ''Fudge'' as its underlying mechanic.&lt;ref&gt;http://rpgblog.typepad.com/rpg_blog/2005/05/the_fate_interv.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 ''[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]]'' magazine named ''Fudge'' as one of ''The Millennium's Most Underrated Games''.  Editor [[Scott Haring]] stated that "''Fudge'' is an extremely flexible, rules-light system. It works great, and everybody who plays it, loves it. Why isn't it more popular? I dunno."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Second Sight: The Millennium's Most Influential Company and The Millennium's Most Underrated Game|journal=[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]] (online)|last=Haring| first=Scott D. |authorlink=Scott Haring | url= http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/login/article.html?id=1240| date=1999-11-25| accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name==
At the time ''Fudge'' was conceived, it was stylish to give role-playing games acronyms for names (for instance, ''[[GURPS]]'' and ''[[TWERPS]]'') and originally the usenet design project referred to the game as ''SLUG'', for "Simple Laid-back Universal Game".&lt;ref name="desnotes" /&gt; However, this was soon changed to ''FUDGE'' for "Free-form Universal Donated Gaming Engine", but also because the word invoked connotations of an easy to make source of fun. This again was changed when Grey Ghost Press released their 1995 hardcopy version of the game, to "Free-form Universal Do-it-yourself Gaming Engine".

With the publication of the Expanded Edition in 2000, the fad for acronym-based names had long since faded, and the writer and the publisher both felt that the forced acronym had become irrelevant. The game has been referred to officially as just ''Fudge'' ever since, though fans often still refer to it in the old manner as ''FUDGE''.

==Game mechanics==
[[Image:FUDGE 4dF probability.svg|thumb|300px|right|Probability of results when rolling 4dF]]
In ''Fudge'', character Traits such as [[attribute (role-playing games)|Attributes]] and [[skill (role-playing)|Skills]], are rated on a seven-level, ascending [[adjective]] scale: ''Terrible, Poor, Mediocre, Fair, Good, Great,'' and ''Superb.''

''Fudge'' characters can also have Gifts and Faults, which are positive and negative traits that do not fit into the adjective scale.

===Fudge dice===
[[File:White Fudge Dice.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A set of Fudge dice]]
''Fudge'' uses customized "''Fudge'' [[dice]]" which have an equal number of plus, minus and blank sides. A number of these dice are rolled, usually four at a time ("4dF" in Fudge [[dice notation]]), and for every plus side that comes up the result of using the Trait is considered one step higher (e.g. from ''Fair'' to ''Good'') and for every minus side that comes up the result is considered one step lower. The goal is to match or surpass the difficulty level, also on the adjective scale, of the test. Thus, a ''Good'' attribute is considered to be ''Great'' if the player were to roll two plus sides, one minus side, and one blank—the minus side cancels out one of the plus sides and the remaining plus side raises the result by one step. The same ''Good'' attribute would be considered ''Poor'' if you were to roll three minus sides and one blank. The same dice roll can be achieved with six-sided dice, treating a 1 or 2 as [−], a 3-4 as [&amp;nbsp;] and a 5-6 as [+].

There are also several alternative dice systems available that use ten-sided dice, coins, or playing cards.

==Complexity==
The rules of ''Fudge'' are highly customizable and can be adjusted for the level of simplicity or complexity desired by the Game Master and Players. Overall, the system is designed to encourage role-playing over strict adherence to an arbitrary set of rules. In fact, the main ''Fudge'' documents encourage players to "Just Fudge It"; that is, to focus on the story being created rather than on the game rules. For example, one character creation method encourages players to first write prose descriptions of their characters and then translate those into ''Fudge'' Traits.

{{Sociology}}
'''Hard power''' is the use of [[military]] and [[economics |economic]] means to [[social influence| influence]] the behavior or interests of other political bodies. This form of political power is often aggressive ([[coercion]]), and is most immediately effective when imposed by one political body upon another of lesser military and/or economic power.&lt;ref name=hard&gt;{{cite web|title= Hard Power Vs. Soft Power|url= http://www.themarknews.com/articles/895-hard-power-vs-soft-power|publisher= The Mark|accessdate= 26 April 2012|author= Daryl Copeland|date= Feb 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hard power contrasts with [[soft power]], which comes from [[diplomacy]], [[culture]] and [[history]].&lt;ref name=hard/&gt;

According to [[Joseph Nye]], hard power involves "the ability to use the [[carrots and sticks]] of economic and military might to make others follow your will". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Propaganda Isn't the Way: Soft Power|url= http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/1240/propaganda_isnt_the_way.html|publisher= International Herald Tribune|accessdate= October 1, 2012|author= Joseph Nye|date= January 10, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, "carrots" stand for inducements such as the reduction of trade barriers, the offer of an alliance or the promise of military protection. On the other hand, "sticks" represent threats - including the use of [[coercive diplomacy]], the threat of [[war | military intervention]], or the implementation of [[economic sanctions]]. [[Ernest J. Wilson III| Ernest Wilson]] describes hard power as the capacity to coerce "another to act in ways in which that entity would not have acted otherwise".&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
While the existence of hard power has a long history, the term itself arose when [[Joseph Nye]] coined ''soft power'' as a new and different form of power in a [[sovereign state]]'s foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joseph Nye on Smart Power in Iran-U.S. Relations|url=http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/18420/joseph_nye_on_smart_power_in_iranus_relations.html|publisher=Belfer Center|accessdate=26 April 2012|author=Kayhan Barzegar|date=July 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the realist school in international relations theory, power is linked with the possession of certain tangible resources, including population, territory, natural resources, economic and military strength, among others. Hard power describes a nation or political body’s ability to use economic incentives or military strength to influence other actors’ behaviors. 

Hard power encompasses a wide range of coercive policies, such as [[coercive diplomacy]], [[economic sanctions]], [[war | military action]], and the forming of [[military alliance|military alliances]] for [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]] and mutual defense.  Hard power can be used to establish or change a state of political [[hegemony]] or [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]].  Although the term ''hard power'' generally refers to diplomacy, it can also be used to describe forms of negotiation which involve pressure or threats as leverage.  

==Examples==
{{expand section|date=April 2012}}
The use of hard power is often tedious. Insurgencies against the external force can be prominent. The United States has demonstrated a 'hard power' policy in regard to the [[Iraq War]], the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan War]] and its continued war on the [[Taliban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When it comes to Afghanistan, mixing military might with diplomatic talk is easier said than done.|url=http://www.themarknews.com/articles/895-hard-power-vs-soft-power|publisher=The Mark|accessdate=26 April 2012|author=Daryl Copeland|date=Feb 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Between Hard Power and Soft.|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/between-hard-power-and-soft_618798.html|publisher=The Weekly Standard|accessdate=26 April 2012|author=[[Roy Godson]]|date=Feb 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be more specific, the United States’ attack on Iraq in 2003 was based on the concerns about Iraq’s possession of [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD). In part by referring to “[[War on Terrorism]],” [[George W. Bush]] administration used hard power measures to uproot Iraqi dictator [[Saddam Hussein]] and to handle subsequent crisis in Iraq. However, many critics mention that the war in Iraq had the United States lose its reputation as an icon for [[democracy]] and justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soft Power, Hard Power, and Our Image Abroad|url=http://www.lagrange.edu/resources/pdf/citations/2010/22quirk_politicalscience.pdf|accessdate=2 October 2012|author=Tim Quirk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Nye has used the term to define some policy measures in regard to [[Iran]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joseph Nye on Smart Power in Iran-U.S. Relations|url=http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/18420/joseph_nye_on_smart_power_in_iranus_relations.html|publisher=Belfer Center|accessdate=26 April 2012|author=Kayhan Barzegar|date=July 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, there are many sanctions against Iran passed by [[UN Security Council]] and numerous nations such as the United States and those of the European Union also impose bilateral sanctions against Iran. They impose restrictions on exports of nuclear and missile to Iran, banking and insurance transactions, investment in oil, exports of refined petroleum products, and so on. Such measures are taken by many nations to deter Iran’s possible nuclear weapon program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ariel Zirulnick |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-Issues/2011/0224/Sanction-Qaddafi-How-5-nations-have-reacted-to-sanctions./Iran |title=Sanction Qaddafi?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4887">'''Henrik Plenge Jakobsen''' (born 1967 in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]) is a Danish [[conceptual art]]ist, who works in a variety of media, from [[sculpture]] and [[installation art]] to [[performance art]] and public intervention.

He has studied at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Art]], Copenhagen, Denmark, from 1987–94, [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]] and Institut des Hautes Etudes en Art plastique, [[Paris|Paris, France]], from 1992-93.

Henrik Plenge Jakobsen lives in Copenhagen.

== Work ==
Plenge Jakobsens project is socio-critical in the sense that he examines and discusses political, economical, cultural and social structures forming the foundation of modern life. Like the [[Situationist International|Situationists]], he is interested in finding a meaningful art form capable of defining a place in the public space, while directly making use of everyday institutions. His project does not seek to cannibalize reality but to incorporate reality into the work itself. His work is radical exactly because it insists on the work’s real presence rather than interrogating the foundation of reality. For Plenge Jakobsen, art and reality are not separate spheres that can be temporarily forced together. Existing in the world, art represents one of the realities that constitute life.
Henrik Plenge Jakobsens work can be described as a configuration of visual elements in spatial arrangements, often involving an additional element of action or performance. Many of his works combine sculptural elements and objects in a plastic display positioned between sculpture and installation. Differing from the theatrical and systemic, “total” form of classic [[installation art]]. Plenge Jakobsens installation stratagems are based on a more unrestrained, flexible arrangement in which the room is merely an arbitrary architectural frame rather than a meaningful collaborator.&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Torp: ''All that is Solid Melts into Air'', Henrik Plenge Jakobsen: ''J’accuse'', Pork Salad Press, 2006, pp. 4-13&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Historicity''' in [[philosophy]] is the idea or fact that something has a historical origin and developed through history: concepts, practices, values. This is opposed to the belief that the same thing, in particular [[normative]] [[institution]]s or correlated [[ideology|ideologies]], are [[nature|natural]] or [[essence|essential]] and thus exist [[Cultural universal|universally]].

Historicity relates to the underlying concept of [[history]], or the intersection of [[teleology]] (the concept and study of progress and purpose), [[temporality]] (the concept of time), and [[historiography]] ([[semiotics]] and history of [[history]]). Varying conceptualizations of historicity emphasize linear progress or the repetition or modulation of past events.{{cn|date=October 2013}}

== Concepts of historicity ==
In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], historicity is the history of constitution of any [[intentionality|intentional]] object, both in the sense of history as [[tradition]] and in the sense where every individual has its own history. Of course, these two senses are often very similar: One individual's history is heavily influenced by the tradition the individual is formed in, but personal history can also produce an object that wouldn't be a part of any tradition. In addition, personal historicity doesn't develop in the same way as tradition.

[[Martin Heidegger]] argued in ''[[Being and Time]]'' that it is temporality that gives rise to history. All things have their place and time, and nothing past is outside of history. [[Ingo Farin]] agues that Heidegger appropriated the concept from [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and from [[Paul Yorck von Wartenburg]] &lt;ref&gt;Farin, Ingo. "Three levels of historical analysis in early Heidegger." The New Yearbook for Phenomenology and Phenomenological Philosophy XII XII (2013): 1-37.&lt;/ref&gt; and further clarifies Heidegger's meaning: 

: ''Heidegger calls authentic historicity the historical awareness that recognizes this whole range (i.e., the “simultaneity” of past, present, and future in the historical action one resolves to undertake).''

[[Francis Fukuyama]], in ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'', famously argued that the collapse of [[Soviet communism]] brought humanity to the "end of history" whereby the world's global dialectical machinations had been resolved with the triumph of liberal capitalism.

Before Fukuyama, [[Jean Baudrillard]] argued for a different concept of the "end of history". Baudrillard's most in-depth writings on the notion of historicity are found in the books ''Fatal Strategies'' and ''The Illusion of the End''. It is for these writings that he received a full-chapter denunciation from the physicist [[Alan Sokal]] (along with [[Jean Bricmont]]), due to his alleged misuse of physical concepts of linear time, space and stability. In contrast to Fukuyama's argument, Baudrillard maintained that the "end of history", in terms of a [[teleology|teleological]] goal, had always been an illusion brought about by modernity's will towards progress, civilisation and rational unification. And this was an illusion that to all intents and purposes vanished toward the end of the 20th century, brought about by the "speed" at which society moved, effectively "destabilising" the linear progression of history (it is these comments, specifically, that provoked Sokal's criticism). History was, so to speak, outpaced by its own spectacular realisation. As Baudrillard himself caustically put it:

:''The end of history is, alas, also the end of the dustbins of history. There are no longer any dustbins for disposing of old ideologies, old regimes, old values. Where are we going to throw Marxism, which actually invented the dustbins of history? (Yet there is some justice here since the very people who invented them have fallen in.) Conclusion: if there are no more dustbins of history,'' this is because History itself has become a dustbin. ''It has become its own dustbin, just as the planet itself is becoming its own dustbin.''&lt;ref&gt;Jean Baudrillard, ''The Illusion of the End'', 1994, p. 26; also in Jean Baudrillard, ''Selected Writings'', 2001, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach to history is what marks out Baudrillard's affinities with the [[postmodernism|postmodern]] philosophy of [[Jean-François Lyotard]]: the idea that society — and Western society in particular — has "dropped out" of the grand narratives of history (for example, the coming of Communism, or the triumph of civilised modern society). But Baudrillard has supplemented this argument by contending that, although this "dropping out" may have taken place, the global world (which in Baudrillard's writing is sharply distinct from a [[universal humanity]]) is, in accordance with its spectacular understanding of itself, condemned to "play out" this illusory ending in a hyper-teleological way — acting out the end of the end of the end, ''ad infinitum''. Thus Baudrillard argues that — in a manner similar to that of [[Giorgio Agamben]]'s book ''Means without Ends'' — Western society is subject to the political restriction of means that are justified by ends that do not exist.

[[Michel-Rolph Trouillot]] offers a different insight into the meaning and uses of historicity. Trouillot explains, "The ways in which what happened, and what is said to have happened are and are not the same may itself be historical".

'''Intellectual freedom''' encompasses the freedom to hold, receive and disseminate ideas without restriction.&lt;ref name="ala_faq"&gt;{{cite web | date = May 29, 2007 | url =http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/censorshipfirstamendmentissues/ifcensorshipqanda | title = Intellectual Freedom and Censorship Q &amp; A | publisher =American Library Association | accessdate =2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewed as an integral component of a democratic society, intellectual freedom protects an individual's right to access, explore, consider, and express ideas and information as the basis for a self-governing, well-informed citizenry. Intellectual freedom comprises the bedrock for freedoms of expression, speech, and the press and relates to freedoms of information and privacy.

The [[United Nations]] upholds intellectual freedom as a basic human right through Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] which asserts:
:Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url =https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a19 | title =Universal Declaration of Human Rights | format = | work = | publisher =UN| accessdate =2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institution of libraries in particular values intellectual freedom as part of their mission to provide and protect access to information and ideas. The [[American Library Association]] (ALA) defines intellectual freedom as "the right of every individual to both seek and receive information from all points of view without restriction. It provides for free access to all expressions of ideas through which any and all sides of a question, cause or movement can be explored."&lt;ref name="ala_faq"/&gt;

The modern concept of intellectual freedom developed out of an opposition to book censorship.&lt;ref name="ifmanual.org"&gt;{{cite web | last= | first = | authorlink = | url =http://ifmanual.org/Part1 | title= Intellectual Freedom Manual: Eighth edition | format = | work = | publisher = ALA| accessdate =2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is promoted by several professions and movements. These entities include, among others, [[library|librarianship]], [[education]], and the [[Free Software Movement]].

==Issues==
Intellectual freedom encompasses many areas including issues of [[academic freedom]], [[Internet censorship|Internet filtering]], and [[censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url =http://www.ala.org/ala/aboutala/offices/oif/ifissues/default.cfm | title =ALA Intellectual Freedom Issues | format = | work = | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because proponents of intellectual freedom value an individual's right to choose informational concepts and media to formulate thought and opinion without repercussion, restrictions to access and barriers to privacy of information constitute intellectual freedom issues. 
Issues surrounding restrictions to access include:
*[[Banned-books|banned books]], [[book burning]], and [[Challenge (literature)|challenges to literature]]
*censorship and attempts to censor including, but not limited to [[book censorship]], [[film censorship]], [[censorship of music]], [[censorship of maps]], censorship of individual words, censorship of comic books, and [[video game censorship]]
*[[self-censorship]] by authors, editors, journalists, or library materials selectors
*internet filtering through [[content-control software]]
*internet filtering through [[internet censorship]]
*internet safety legislation and initiatives such as [[Children's Internet Protection Act]] (CIPA) and Neighborhood Internet Protection Act (NCIPA)
*[[net neutrality]]
*government information and [[Freedom of information laws by country|freedom of information laws]]
Issues concerning barriers to privacy of information include:
*[[data mining]]
*[[surveillance]]
*[[data protection]] and [[information privacy]] laws and practices
*confidentiality of library users' records of access
*legislation that suspends civil liberties in the name of [[national security]] such as the [[Patriot act|Patriot Act]] and the [[Homeland Security Act]]
While proponents of intellectual freedom work to prohibit acts of censorship, calls for censorship are valued as free speech. "In expressing their opinions and concerns, would-be censors are exercising the same rights librarians seek to protect when they confront censorship. In making their criticisms known, people who object to certain ideas are exercising the same rights as those who created and disseminated the material to which they object."&lt;ref name="ala_faq"/&gt; The [[first amendment]] right to voice opinions and persuade others—both for the exclusion and inclusion of content and concepts—should be protected.

==History==
The contemporary definition, limits, and inclusions of intellectual freedom primarily developed through a number of [[common law]] judgments by the [[US Supreme Court|United States Supreme Court]] regarding the [[First amendment|First Amendment]] and policy statements of groups dedicated to the advocacy and defense of [[civil liberties]].

===''Abrams v. United States'' (1919)===
{{Main|Abrams v. United States}}
In his oft-quoted dissent on the free speech case of two defendants convicted of inciting anti-war sentiment and action, Supreme Court justice [[Louis Brandeis]] aligns the freedoms of speech and expression with the freedom of thought as follows:
:Persecution for the expression of opinions seems to me perfectly logical. If you have no doubt of your premises or your power and want a certain result with all your heart you naturally express your wishes in law and sweep away all opposition . . . But when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas. . . The best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes can be safely carried out."&lt;ref&gt;''Abrams v. United States,'' 250 U.S. 616, 626 (1919)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Whitney v. California'' (1927)===
{{Main|Whitney v. California}}
A case in which the Supreme Court sustains the conviction of a woman for anti-government speech akin to terrorism. In his opinion on the matter, Justice Brandeis delineates the role of freedom of thought to inform free speech, attributing the value of intellectual freedom as a civil liberty to the founders of the United States, asserting:
:Those who won our independence believed that the final end of the state was to make men free to develop their faculties. . . They believed that freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth.&lt;ref&gt;"Whitney v. California," 274 U.S. 357 (1927)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Olmstead v. United States'' (1928)===
{{Main|Olmstead v. United States}}
A case in which the US Supreme Court deliberated whether a citizen's Fourth or Fifth Amendment rights were violated when evidence to convict him of bootlegging was obtained through wiretapping. Justice Brandeis provides precedence for the inclusion of intellectual freedom as a constitutional right in his dissenting opinion, claiming the US Constitution's authors "recognized the significance of man's spiritual nature, his feelings, and his intellect" and "sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts, their emotions and their sensations." Brandeis would ultimately argue for the right to privacy, another important dimension of intellectual freedom, as an extension of American civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;"Olmstead v. United States," 277 U.S. 438 (1928)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''United States v. Schwimmer'' (1929)===
{{Main|United States v. Schwimmer}}
In the Supreme Court's upheld decision to deny citizenship to Rosika Schwimmer, a Hungarian immigrant, because she refused to pledge to take up arms to defend the United States out of her pacifist views and beliefs, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. personally disagrees with the defendant's views but professionally upholds Schwimmer's position when he writes,
:Some of her answers might excite popular prejudice, but if there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other it is the principle of free thought – not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought we hate.&lt;ref&gt;"United States v. Schwimmer," 279 U.S. 644 (1929)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Library Bill of Rights (1939)===
{{Main|Library Bill of Rights}}
The [[American Library Association]] adopts the Library Bill of Rights affirming "that all libraries are forums for information and ideas." Originally a three-point declaration to guide services in American free public libraries including statements on "growing intolerance, suppression of free speech, and censorship," today the Library Bill of Rights includes six basic policies to guide library services that affirm intellectual freedom.

===Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948)===
{{Main|Universal Declaration of Human Rights}}
Following World War II, the [[United Nations]] adopts The Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a "foundation of human rights law" consisting of 30 articles on international freedoms among the nations of the UN General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Law, http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/hr_law.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Articles 18 and 19 specifically affirm rights to freedoms of thought, opinion, and expression, as well as the right to "seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."&lt;ref&gt;"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights", http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lauterbach Award acceptance speech (1953)===
In his 1953 acceptance speech for the Lauterbach Award for support of civil liberties, Supreme Court justice [[William O. Douglas]] affirms that "safety of our civilization lies in making freedom of thought and freedom of speech vital, vivid features of life" and condemns "[r]estriction of free thought and free speech," labeling it "the most dangerous of all subversions," and an "un-American act."&lt;ref&gt;The One Un-American Act. Nieman Reports, vol. 7, no. 1 (January 1953): p. 20)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Freedom to Read (1953)===
The American Library Association adopts The Freedom to Read, a key library policy endorsing an individual's civil rights to free expression and intellectual freedom through the exchange of ideas through reading and writing. The ALA's [http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/freedomreadstatement The Freedom to Read] includes seven affirmations and responsibilities to protect an individual's right to read as a basic tenet of democracy.  In 1979, the ALA expands upon The Freedom to Read, adopting The Freedom to View, a policy which extends the understanding of intellectual freedom to include the visual acquisition of information through visual media such as art, video, movies, pictures, the internet, and more.

===''Brandenburg v Ohio (1969)''===
{{Main|Brandenburg v. Ohio}}
A case in which the US Supreme Court established the [[Imminent lawless action|Imminent Lawless Action]] standard.  The Supreme Court overturned KKK leader, Clarence Brandenburg's conviction of one to ten years in prison and a fine of $1000 sentenced by the [[Ohio Courts of Common Pleas|Court of Common Pleas]] of [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]]. The Court ruled that hate speech is protected under [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights as long as it does not incite violence. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://landmarkcases.c-span.org/Case/23/Brandenburg-v-Ohio|title=C-SPAN Landmark Cases {{!}} Brandenburg v Ohio|website=landmarkcases.c-span.org|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling established the modern doctrine of [[clear and present danger]] which determines what limits may be placed on First Amendment freedoms.  Only speech that directly incites lawless action may be restricted. 

==Intellectual freedom and librarianship==

The profession of librarianship views intellectual freedom as a core responsibility. [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions|The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions']] (IFLA) [https://web.archive.org/web/20070207075253/http://www.ifla.org/faife/policy/iflastat/iflastat.htm Statement on Libraries and Intellectual Freedom] "calls upon libraries and library staff to adhere to the principles of intellectual freedom, uninhibited access to information and freedom of expression and to recognize the privacy of library user."  IFLA urges its members to actively promote the acceptance and realization of intellectual freedom principles.  IFLA states: "The right to know is a requirement for freedom of thought and conscience; freedom of thought and freedom of expression are necessary conditions for freedom of access to information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| url =http://www.ifla.org/faife/policy/iflastat/iflastat.htm| title =IFLA Statement on Libraries and Intellectual Freedom| work =| publisher =IFLA| accessdate =2007-03-04| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070207075253/http://www.ifla.org/faife/policy/iflastat/iflastat.htm| archivedate =2007-02-07| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual national library associations expand upon these principles when defining intellectual freedom for their constituents. For example, the [[American Library Association]] defines intellectual freedom as: "[T]he right of every individual to both seek and receive information from all points of view without restriction. It provides for free access to all expressions of ideas through which any and all sides of a question, cause or movement may be explored. ....  Intellectual freedom encompasses the freedom to hold, receive and disseminate ideas."&lt;ref name="ala_faq"/&gt;

The [[Canadian Library Association|Canadian Library Association's]] ''Position Statement on Intellectual Freedom'' states that all persons possess "the fundamental right ... to have access to all expressions of knowledge, creativity and intellectual activity, and to express their thoughts publicly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| url =http://www.cla.ca/Content/NavigationMenu/Resources/PositionStatements/Statement_on_Intell.htm| title =Canadian Library Association / Association canadienne des bibliothèques Position Statement on Intellectual Freedom| work =| publisher =CLA| accessdate =2007-03-04| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080303081400/http://www.cla.ca/Content/NavigationMenu/Resources/PositionStatements/Statement_on_Intell.htm| archivedate =2008-03-03| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; This right was enshrined into law in 2004 in [[British Columbia]], which grants protection against litigation for libraries for their holdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://leg.bc.ca/37th5th/1st_read/gov62-1.htm |title=ATTORNEY GENERAL STATUTES AMENDMENT ACT, 2004 | publisher=BC | accessdate=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other national library associations have similarly adopted [https://web.archive.org/web/20070207034904/http://www.ifla.org/faife/ifstat/ifstat.htm statements on intellectual freedom].

The ALA's Office for Intellectual Freedom organizes the relationship between librarianship and intellectual freedom into five distinct categories:
*The library user's access to information through a library collection
*The librarian's professional responsibilities to select a diverse collection of library materials for users and protect library users' confidentiality and rights to privacy in their use of library materials
*The librarian's personal rights to free expression and choices of lifestyle and public participation without professional repercussion
*The library's institutional role as an agent of social change, democracy, and education
*The issue of advocacy v. neutrality for libraries and librarians&lt;ref&gt;Office for Intellectual Freedom of the American Library Association. ''Intellectual Freedom Manual'', (Chicago: American Library Association, 2010), p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Libraries protect, defend, and advocate for intellectual freedom through a variety of organizations and resources.

===Intellectual Freedom Committee===
The Intellectual Freedom Committee (IFC) is a council committee of the American Library Association (ALA), composed of 11 ALA members who are appointed by ALA's Council to serve 2-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url =http://www.ala.org/groups/committees/ala/ala-if | title =IFC | format = | work = | publisher =American Library Association | accessdate =2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Intellectual Freedom Committee functions as an advisory and educational arm of the ALA's commitment to intellectual freedom. The IFC recommends policies concerning intellectual freedom and censorship, drafts guidelines for library professionals to advocate and defend intellectual freedom including The Universal Right to Free Expression and Importance of Education to Intellectual Freedom, and drafts policy statements adopted by the ALA including several interpretation statements on the Library Bill of Rights such as:
*Access to Electronic Information, Services, and Networks
*Access to Library Resources and Services Regardless of Gender or Sexual Orientation
*Free Access to Libraries for Minors
*Prisoners' Right to Read
*Statement on Library Use of Filtering Software&lt;ref&gt;Office for Intellectual Freedom of the American Library Association. ''Intellectual Freedom Manual'', (Chicago: American Library Association, 2010), p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt;
The IFC drafts and submits statements to the ALA as part of the committee's charge to "recommend such steps as may be necessary to safeguard the rights of library users, libraries, and librarians, in accordance with the first amendment to the united states constitution and the Library Bill of Rights as adopted by the ALA Council [and] work closely with the Office for Intellectual Freedom and with other units and officers of the association in matters touching intellectual freedom and censorship."&lt;ref&gt;"IFC"&lt;/ref&gt;

Formed in 1940 and originally titled 'Committee on Intellectual Freedom to Safeguard the Rights of Library Users to Freedom of Inquiry,' the committee has also been known as 'Committee on Intellectual Freedom' before the currently titled 'Intellectual Freedom Committee.'&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Louise S. ''Censorship and the American Library: The American Library Association's Response to Threats to Intellectual Freedom, 1939-1969'.' (Westport, CN: Greenwood Press, 1996). p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Following the ALA's formation of the IFC to promote intellectual freedom on a national level, many regional and state library associations have established additional intellectual freedom committees on the state level.

===Office for Intellectual Freedom===
The American Library Association's Office for Intellectual Freedom (OIF) serves as an administrative arm of ALA committees such as the Intellectual Freedom Committee and the Committee on Professional Ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Office for Intellectual Freedom of the American Library Association. ''Intellectual Freedom Manual'', (Chicago: American Library Association, 2010), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Principally charged with implementing ALA policies concerning intellectual freedom, the OIF focuses efforts on intellectual freedom education and coordination of intellectual freedom activities, events, and organizations and views the "responsibility of the office to recommend, develop, implement, and maintain a total intellectual freedom program for ALA.&lt;ref name="ALA Offices"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url =http://www.ala.org/offices/ | title =ALA Offices | format = | work = | publisher =American Library Association | accessdate =2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
OIF functions include:
*'''Banned Books Week''', an annual event that celebrates the freedom to read sponsored by publishing, bookselling, civil rights, teaching, and library organizations associated with intellectual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| url =http://www.ala.org/bbooks/bannedbooksweek| title =Banned Books Week| format =| work =| publisher =American Library Association| accessdate =2014-07-20| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20161202030807/http://www.ala.org/bbooks/bannedbooksweek#| archive-date =2016-12-02| dead-url =yes| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Choose Privacy Week''', an annual event that promotes conversation and provides resources for individuals to think more critically about digital-age privacy rights. The OIF partners with many national coalitions focused upon digital rights and privacy such as the [[Aclu|American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), the Center for Information Policy Research (CIPR), the [[Center for Democracy and Technology|Center For Democracy &amp; Technology]], the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF), the [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]] (EPIC), and [[Privacy Rights Clearinghouse]] (PRC).&lt;ref name="ALA Offices"/&gt;
*'''Frequently Challenged Books List''', a database of challenged materials collected from news reports and individuals (often through the OIF's electronic ''Challenge Reporting Form''. Although the database provides information on banned books, challenged books, frequently challenged authors, and challenged classics since 1990, the OIF asserts that they "do not claim comprehensiveness in recording challenges as research suggests that for each challenge reported there are as many as four or five that go unreported."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url =http://www.ala.org/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks | title =Frequently Challenged Books | format = | work = | publisher =American Library Association | accessdate =2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Newsletter on Intellectual Freedom''''' ('''''NIF'''''), a bimonthly digital publication serving as "the only journal that reports attempts to remove materials from school and library shelves across the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url =http://www.ala.org/offices/oif/oifprograms/ifpubs/nif/newsletterintellectual | title =Newsletter on Intellectual Freedom | format = | work = | publisher =American Library Association | accessdate =2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Intellectual Freedom Action Network (IFAN)''', an ad hoc, grassroots group of volunteers who liaison between the national efforts of the OIF and intellectual freedom issues within members' communities. IFAN members monitor censorship issues in their communities and lend support to anti-censorship and intellectual freedom instances through civic involvement such as letters to the editor or political representatives and/or attendance at public meetings and hearings concerning intellectual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url =http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?section=archive&amp;template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=164217 | title =Intellectual Freedom Action Network | format = | work = | publisher =American Library Association | accessdate =2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''IFACTION''', an e-list education forum on intellectual freedom issues and concepts that replaced the OIF's former print newsletter, ''Intellectual Freedom News''.&lt;ref&gt;"Intellectual Freedom Action Network"&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Webinars''', including a sizable archive of webinars concerning intellectual freedom issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url =http://www.ala.org/offices/oif/oifprograms/webinars | title =Webinars | format = | work = | publisher =American Library Association | accessdate =2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual Freedom Round Table===
The ALA's Intellectual Freedom Round Table (IFRT) functions as a forum for ALA members to participate in intellectual freedom initiatives and efforts. The IFRT serves as a communication channel and promotional group for ALA members seeking increasing participation and knowledge in intellectual freedom concepts and issues. While the IFRT mirrors other intellectual freedom organizations through monitoring, support, and educational efforts, the IFRT provides more varied intellectual freedom discussion forums for librarians in two ways:
*Organizing state and local level intellectual freedom discussion programs and activities
*Planning and sponsoring conference programs on topics related to intellectual freedom
In addition to encouraging and fostering a community of librarians learning, promoting, and defending intellectual freedom principles, the IFRT administers three intellectual freedom awards (see below) and produces an Intellectual Freedom Report to members of the American Library Association four times per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url =http://www.ala.org/ifrt/ | title =IFRT | format = | work = | publisher =American Library Association | accessdate =2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom to Read Foundation===
The [[Freedom to Read Foundation]] was incorporated in 1969 by members of the American Library Association. Although founded by ALA members, the FTRF is a separate organization from ALA with separate membership focused upon the legal defense of intellectual freedom for libraries, librarians, library staff, and library trustees.&lt;ref&gt;Office for Intellectual Freedom of the American Library Association. ''Intellectual Freedom Manual'', (Chicago: American Library Association, 2010), p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; While the FTRF participates in intellectual freedom education efforts, the FTRF primarily aims to "support and defend librarians whose positions are jeopardized because of their resistance to abridgments of the First Amendment; and to set legal precedent for the freedom to read on behalf of all the people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url =http://www.ftrf.org/?page=About | title =About FTRF | format = | work = | publisher =Freedom to Read Foundation | accessdate =2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the foundation's commitment to "the principle that the solution to offensive speech is more speech, and the suppression of speech on the grounds that it gives offense to some infringes on the rights of all to a free, open and robust marketplace of ideas,"&lt;ref name="About FTRF"&gt;"About FTRF"&lt;/ref&gt; the FTRF awards and distributes grants to aid intellectual freedom litigation, directly participates as a party to intellectual freedom litigation, and submits amicus curiae briefs in freedom of speech and freedom of the press cases.&lt;ref&gt;Office for Intellectual Freedom of the American Library Association. ''Intellectual Freedom Manual'', (Chicago: American Library Association, 2010), p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt; FTRF assistance to library staff whose jobs have been jeopardized due to their defense of intellectual freedom "attempts to obviate the choice between upholding intellectual freedom principles and" what lauded librarian and library-science scholar [[Lester Asheim]] called "three square meals a day."&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, p.158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asheim, Lester. "Not Censorship but Selection," ''WLB'' 28 (September 1953): 67.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The organization's charter describes four purposes for the Foundation, including:
*Promoting and protecting the freedom of speech and of the press;
*Protecting the public's right of access to information and materials stored in the nation's libraries;
*Safeguarding libraries' right to disseminate all materials contained in their collections; and
*Supporting libraries and librarians in their defense of First Amendment rights by supplying them with legal counsel or the means to secure it.&lt;ref name="About FTRF"/&gt;

===LeRoy C. Merritt Humanitarian Fund===
The LeRoy C. Merritt Humanitarian Fund provides financial assistance to librarians who are:
*"Denied employment rights or discriminated against on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, race, color, creed, religion, age, disability, or place of national origin; or
*Denied employment rights because of defense of intellectual freedom; that is, threatened with loss of employment or discharged because of their stand for the cause of intellectual freedom, including promotion of freedom of the press, freedom of speech, the freedom of librarians to select items for their collections from all the world’s written and recorded information, and defense of privacy rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url =http://www.ala.org/groups/affiliates/relatedgroups/merrittfund/merritthumanitarian | title =Merritt Fund | format = | work = | publisher =American Library Association | accessdate =2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Originally established by the Freedom to Read Foundation in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;Office for Intellectual Freedom of the American Library Association. ''Intellectual Freedom Manual'', (Chicago: American Library Association, 2010), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; the Merritt Fund now functions independently, governed by three trustees elected by donors to the fund.&lt;ref&gt;"Merritt Fund"&lt;/ref&gt; The fund's namesake LeRoy C. Merritt participated in the defense and advocacy of intellectual freedom throughout his life in a variety of ways including authoring numerous intellectual freedom and anti-censorship books and articles, editing the ALA's Newsletter on Intellectual Freedom from 1962 to 1970, as the first recipient of the Robert B. Downs Intellectual Freedom Award, and, donating the entirety of the Downs prize to the Freedom to Read Foundation, as the FTRF's first benefactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| url =http://www.ala.org/groups/affiliates/relatedgroups/merrittfund/leroycmerritt/leroycmerritt| title =LeRoy C.

===Intellectual Freedom Manual===
The [[American Library Association]]'s Office for Intellectual Freedom publishes the ''Intellectual Freedom Manual'', now in its ninth edition. Considered an authoritative resource on intellectual freedom for library professionals, it is also of use to members of the public who wish to stay informed of the most recent policies and developments in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Fourie, Ian (2008). Intellectual Freedom Manual 7th ed. Collection Building, 27(2), p. 91. Emerald Group Publishing Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as providing an historical overview of the topic, it is divided into parts which cover key issues such as the [[Library Bill of Rights]], protecting the freedom to read, intellectual freedom and the law, and preserving, protecting and working for intellectual freedom.&lt;ref name="ifmanual.org"/&gt; Expanding on the new addition to the manual is the section on Privacy; an Interpretation of the Library Bill of Rights &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/librarybill/interpretations/privacy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaboration between associated organizations===
Many of the entities listed above collaborate with one another and other organizations including:
*Association of American Publishers
*American Booksellers Association
*American Booksellers Association for Free Expression
*Center for Democracy and Technology
*Internet Education Foundation
*Media Coalition
*National Coalition Against Censorship
*PEN American Center
*state and regional First Amendment organizations

==Intellectual Freedom Awards==

===Robert B. Downs Intellectual Freedom Award===
Since 1969, the [[UIUC Graduate School of Library and Information Science|Graduate School of Library and Information Science]] (GSLIS) at the University of Illinois annually awards the Robert B. Downs Intellectual Freedom Award. GSLIS faculty named this award for [[Robert B. Downs]] on his 25th anniversary as director of the School in honor of his role as a champion for intellectual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url =http://www.lis.illinois.edu/newsroom/awards/downs-award | title =Downs Award | format = | work = | publisher =University of Illinois Graduate School of Library and Information Science | accessdate =2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downs, also a former President and Vice-President of the ALA, focused his library career working against, and voicing opposition to, literary censorship and authored many books and publications on topics of censorship and intellectual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Donald G.

&lt;/ref&gt; and such governments often claim to have nominal intellectual freedom, although the degree of freedom is a matter of dispute.

==Intellectual freedom in democratic countries during times of crises==

During times of crises there is often debate within democratic countries as to the balance between national security, a successful conclusion to the crises and the maintenance of democratic civil liberties. This debate often takes the form of to what extent a democratic government can curtail civil liberties in the interest of successfully ending the crises.

===Canada===
Such a debate existed in Canada during the Second World War. Since the [[Military history of Canada during World War I|First World War]] the [[War Measures Act]] had existed as legislation in Canada to allow the government to operate with greater powers during times of national crises, such as in wartime. During the [[Military history of Canada during World War II|Second World War]] the federal Liberal government of [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King]] enacted the measure by [[Order in Council|Order-in-Council]]. The War Measures Act and with it the [[Defence of Canada Regulations]] were passed by the federal government in early September 1939. With their implementation civil liberties, especially the intellectual freedom of political dissenters, were curtailed.&lt;ref name="Horn, Michiel 1942. p. 171"&gt;Horn, Michiel, The League for Social Reconstruction: Intellectual Origins of the Democratic Left in Canada 1930-1942. Toronto: U of Toronto Press, 1980. p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;   As well, in Quebec the [[Union nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] government of [[Maurice Duplessis|Premier Maurice Duplessis]] enacted “An Act Respecting Communist Propaganda”, which came to be known as the [[Padlock Act]]. It gave Premier Duplesis, as Attorney General of Quebec, the power to close (hence padlock) any premises used for the purposes of “propagating Communism or Bolshevism.” The Act was criticized by [[Eugene Forsey]], for example, as being far too broad in definition and that it gave the Premier the power to suppress any opinions that he wished to. Forsey cited examples of such abuse in the [[Canadian Forum]].&lt;ref name="Milligan, Frank 2004. p. 139"&gt;Milligan, Frank, Eugene A. Forsey: An Intellectual Biography. Calgary: U of Calgary Press, 2004. p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these measures were criticized by writers in the Canadian Forum such as Eugene Forsey&lt;ref name="Milligan, Frank 2004. p. 139"/&gt;  and [[F. R. Scott|Frank R. Scott]] and by the [[League for Social Reconstruction]] in general; a group to which both Forsey and Scott belonged. Indeed, during the Second World War the Canadian Forum printed an anonymous monthly column outlining civil liberties abuses by Canadian authorities.&lt;ref name="Horn, Michiel 1942. p. 171"/&gt;

===United States===
In the aftermath of the [[September 11th attacks]] issues concerning the suspension or reduction of civil liberties in the name of national security have arisen. Legislation such as the [[Homeland Security Act]] (HSA) of 2002 and the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] (often shortened to the Patriot Act) of 2001 encroach upon intellectual freedom rights to privacy and freedom of information to enhance domestic security from potential terrorist threats and acts.

The Patriot Act in particular has come under fire from numerous intellectual freedom organizations. The [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]] (EPIC) has criticized the Patriot Act as unconstitutional, especially when "the private communications of law-abiding American citizens might be intercepted incidentally,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/usapatriot/#Analysis |title=Analysis of Specific USA PATRIOT Act Provisions: Expanded Dissemination of Information Obtained in Criminal Investigations|accessdate=2014-08-22|work= |publisher=Electronic Privacy Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) maintains that the lower standard applied to wiretaps "gives the FBI a 'blank check' to violate the communications privacy of countless innocent Americans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/patriot/sunset/206.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050524032236/http://www.eff.org/patriot/sunset/206.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2005-05-24|title=Let the Sun Set on PATRIOT - Section 206|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Library Association]] (ALA) has partnered with American libraries in opposition to a provision in Section 215 which allows the FBI to apply for an order to produce materials that assist in an investigation undertaken to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities. The "tangible things" that can be targeted include "books, records, papers, documents, and other items".&lt;ref name="Section215"&gt;USA PATRIOT Act (U.S. [[United States House of Representatives|H.R.]] 3162, Public Law 107-56), Title II, Sec. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intersectionality''' is an [[analytic framework]] that attempts to identify how interlocking systems of power impact those who are most marginalized in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Intersectionality|volume = 1|last=Cooper|first=Brittney|date=1 February 2016|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199328581.013.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intersectionality considers that various forms of [[social stratification]], such as [[Social class|class]], [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[sexual orientation]], age, religion, creed, [[disability]] and [[gender]], do not exist separately from each other but are interwoven together. While the theory began as an exploration of the oppression of women of color within society, today the analysis is potentially applied to all social categories (including social identities usually seen as dominant when considered independently).

==Historical background==
{{external media|width=210px|align=right | topic = [[Women of the World Festival|Women of the World Festival 2016]] | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DW4HLgYPlA ''Kimberlé Crenshaw – On Intersectionality''] via [[Southbank Centre]] on [[YouTube]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people= [[Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw|Kimberlé Crenshaw]] | date= 14 March 2016 |accessdate= 31 May 2016 | title= Kimberlé Crenshaw – On Intersectionality – keynote – WOW 2016 | medium= Video | publisher= [[Southbank Centre]] via YouTube| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DW4HLgYPlA }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The concept of intersectionality is intended to illuminate dynamics that have often been overlooked in feminist movements and theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Thompson | first = Becky | title = Multiracial feminism: recasting the chronology of Second Wave Feminism | journal = [[Feminist Studies]] | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | page = 337 | doi = 10.2307/3178747 | jstor = 3178747 | date = Summer 2002 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; As articulated by [[bell hooks]], such an approach "challenged the notion that 'gender' was the primary factor determining a woman's fate".&lt;ref name="bell hooks 2014"&gt;{{cite book | last = hooks | first = bell | title = Feminist Theory: from margin to center | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2014 | origyear = 1984 | edition = 3rd | isbn = 9781138821668 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This exploration stemmed from a historical exclusion of black women from the feminist movement that had been challenged since the 19th century by black feminists such as [[Anna J. Cooper|Anna Julia Cooper]]. 
The movement led by women of color disputed the idea, common to earlier feminist movements, that women were a homogeneous category who shared the same life experiences. This argument stemmed from the realization that white middle-class women did not serve as an accurate representation of the feminist movement as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Davis | first = Angela Y. | author-link = Angela Davis | title = Women, Race &amp; Class | publisher = Vintage Books | location = New York | year = 1983 | isbn = 9780394713519 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing that the forms of oppression experienced by white middle-class women were different from those experienced by black, poor, or disabled women, feminists sought to understand the ways in which gender, race, and class combined to "determine the female destiny".&lt;ref name="bell hooks 2014"/&gt;

First wave feminism focused on gaining political equality between men and women; however, racial inequality was a factor that was largely ignored by the movement. Consequently, early women's rights movements are often seen as exclusively pertaining to white women's membership, concerns, and struggles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gendered Lives: Communication, Gender, &amp; Culture|last=Fixmer-Oraiz,and Wood|first=Natalie, and Julia|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2015|isbn=978-1-305-28027-4|location=Boston, MA|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third wave feminism is noted for its efforts to understand the multiple layers of oppression present within injustice towards women. Third wave feminism notes the lack of attention to race, class, sexual orientation, and gender identity in early feminist movements, and tries to provide a channel to address political and social disparities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gendered Lives: Communication, Gender, &amp; Culture|last=Fixmer-Oraiz, and Wood|first=Natalie, and Julia|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2015|isbn=978-1-305-28027-4|location=Boston, MA|pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since these factors were not part of the main stream feminism movement, they were seen as struggles that were independent of each other. Intersectionality is a concept that recognizes these issues that were not a part of early social justice movements. 
Leslie McCall argues that the introduction of the intersectionality theory was vital to sociology, claiming that before its development there was little research that specifically addressed the experiences of people who are subjected to multiple forms of subordination within society.&lt;ref name="journals.uchicago.edu"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = McCall | first = Leslie | title = The complexity of intersectionality | journal = [[Signs (journal)|Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society]] | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 1771–1800 | doi = 10.1086/426800 | date = Spring 2005 | jstor = 10.1086/426800 | ref = harv }} [http://anthropology.msu.edu/anp270-us15/files/2015/05/The-Complexity-of-intersectionality-McCall-2005.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also has historical and theoretical links to the concept of "simultaneity" advanced during the 1970s by members of the [[Combahee River Collective]], in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiegman, Robyn (2012), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PAC_r_0nXFsC&amp;pg=PA244 Critical kinship (universal aspirations and intersectional judgements)]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Wiegman | editor-first = Robyn | title = Object lessons | page = 244 | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham, North Carolina | isbn = 9780822351603 | ref = harv | date = 2012-01-11 }}

Other writers and theorists were using intersectional analysis in their work before the term was coined. For example, Chicana feminist theorist [[Gloria E. Anzaldúa|Gloria Anzaldúa]]'s work is described by [[Gloria Wekker]] as exemplifying how, "Existent categories for identity are strikingly not dealt with in separate or mutually exclusive terms, but are always referred to in relation to one another."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Doing Gender in Media, Art and Culture: A Comprehensive Guide to Gender Studies|last=Buikema, Plate &amp; Thiele|first=R., L., K.|publisher=Routeledge|year=2009|isbn=978-0415493833|location=|pages=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wekker also points to the words and activism of [[Sojourner Truth|Sojourner Truth]] as an example of an intersectional approach to social justice.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Feminist thought==
{{Feminism sidebar}}
In 1989, [[Kimberlé Crenshaw]] became the first person to use the word "intersectionality" in the context of feminism.&lt;ref&gt;https://philpapers.org/archive/CREDTI.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/lifestyle/2014/04/kimberl-crenshaw-intersectionality-i-wanted-come-everyday-metaphor-anyone-could|title=Kimberlé Crenshaw on intersectionality: 'I wanted to come up with an everyday metaphor that anyone could use'|date=2 April 2014 |work=[[New Statesman]] |access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;The first use of the term was in a crucial 1989 paper written by Crenshaw for the University of Chicago Legal Forum, "Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/DemarginalizingTheIntersectionOfRaceAndSexABlackFeminis/Demarginalizing+the+Intersection+of+Race+and+Sex_+A+Black+Feminis_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Demarginalizing The Intersection Of Race And Sex A Black Feminis"|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crenshaw 1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Crenshaw | first = Kimberlé | author-link = Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw | title = Demarginalizing the intersection of race and sex: a Black feminist critique of antidiscrimination doctrine, feminist theory and antiracist politics | journal = [[University of Chicago Legal Forum]] | volume = 1989 | pages = 139–168 | date = 1989| url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/uchclf1989&amp;div=10 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; In her work, Crenshaw discussed [[Black feminism]], which argues that the experience of being a black woman cannot be understood in terms of being black and of being a woman considered independently, but must include interactions between the two identities, which frequently reinforce each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Thomas | first1 = Sheila | last2 = Crenshaw | first2 = Kimberlé | author-link2 = Kimberlé Crenshaw | title = Intersectionality: the double bind of race and gender | work = Perspectives Magazine | date = Spring 2004 | page = 2 | publisher = [[American Bar Association]] | url =http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/perspectives_magazine/women_perspectives_Spring2004CrenshawPSP.authcheckdam.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to show that women of color have a vastly different experience from white women due to their race and/or class and that their experiences are not easily voiced or pinpointed, Crenshaw explores two types of male violence against women: [[domestic violence]] and [[rape]]. Through her analysis of these two forms of male violence against women, Crenshaw says that the experiences of women of color consist of a combination or intersection of both racism and sexism.&lt;ref name="Crenshaw 1991"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Crenshaw | first = Kimberlé | author-link = Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw |title=Mapping the margins: intersectionality, identity politics, and violence against women of color |journal=[[Stanford Law Review]] |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=1241–1299 |jstor=1229039 |doi=10.2307/1229039 |date=July 1991 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.695.5934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She says that because women of color are present within discourses that have been designed to address either race or sex, but not both at the same time, women of color are marginalized within both of these systems of oppression.&lt;ref name="Crenshaw 1991" /&gt;

In her work, Crenshaw identifies three aspects of intersectionality as affecting the visibility of women of color: structural intersectionality, political intersectionality, and representational intersectionality. Structural intersectionality deals with how women of color experience domestic violence and rape in a manner qualitatively different from the ways that white women experience them. Political intersectionality examines how [[Feminist legal theory|feminist]] and [[Anti-racism legislation|anti-racists]] laws and policies have paradoxically decreased the visibility of violence against women of color. Finally, representational intersectionality delves into how [[Popular culture|pop culture]] portrayals of women of color can obscure the actual, lived experiences of women of color.&lt;ref name="Crenshaw 1991" /&gt;

The term gained prominence in the 1990s, particularly in the wake of sociologist [[Patricia Hill Collins]]'s further development of Crenshaw's work in her writings on [[black feminism]]. Crenshaw's term replaced her previous coinage "black feminist thought," and "increased the general applicability of her theory from African American women to all women".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mann | first1 = Susan A. | last2 = Huffman | first2 = Douglas J. | title = The decentering of second wave feminism and the rise of the third wave | journal = [[Science &amp; Society]] | volume = 69 | issue = 1 | pages = 56–91 | jstor = 40404229 | date = January 2005 | ref = harv | doi=10.1521/siso.69.1.56.56799}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}} Much like Crenshaw, Collins argued that cultural patterns of oppression are not only interrelated, but are bound together and influenced by the intersectional systems of society, such as race, gender, class, and ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Collins 2000"/&gt;{{rp|42}} Collins described this as "interlocking social institutions [that] have relied on multiple forms of segregation... to produce unjust results".&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Patricia Hill (2009) [1990], "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=icWTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA277 Towards a politics of empowerment]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Collins | editor-first = Patricia Hill | editor-link = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Black feminist thought: knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment | page = 277 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780415964722 | title-link = Black Feminist Thought | year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins sought to create frameworks to think about intersectionality, rather than expanding on the theory itself. She identified three main branches of study within intersectionality. One branch deals with the background, ideas, issues, conflicts, and debates within intersectionality. Another branch seeks to apply intersectionality as an analytical strategy to various [[social institutions]] in order to examine how they might perpetuate social inequality. The final branch formulates intersectionality as a critical praxis to determine how [[social justice]] initiatives can use intersectionality to bring about social change.&lt;ref name="Collins 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Collins|first=Patricia H. | author-link = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Intersectionality's definitional dilemmas | journal = [[Annual Review of Sociology]] | volume = 41 | pages = 1–20 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-soc-073014-112142 | date = 2015 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas behind intersectional feminism existed long before the term was coined. For example, in 1851 [[Sojourner Truth]] delivered her famous "[[Ain't I a Woman?]]" speech, in which she spoke from her racialized position as a former slave to critique essentialist notions of femininity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brah |first1=Avtar |last2=Phoenix |first2=Ann |title=Ain't I A Woman? Revisiting intersectionality |journal=Journal of International Women's Studies | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 75–86 | date = 2004 | url = http://vc.bridgew.edu/jiws/vol5/iss3/8/| ref = harv }} [http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1543&amp;context=jiws Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in her 1892 essay, "The Colored Woman's Office", [[Anna J. Cooper|Anna Julia Cooper]] identifies black women as the most important actors in social change movements, because of their experience with multiple facets of oppression.&lt;ref name=Cooper2009&gt;Cooper, Anna Julia (2017) [1892], "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ONFVDgAAQBAJ The colored woman's office]", in {{cite book |editor-last = Lemert|editor-first = Charles | title = Social theory: the multicultural, global, and classic readings | publisher = Westview Press | location = Boulder, Colorado | edition = 6th | isbn = 9780813350448 |date = 2016-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though intersectionality began with the exploration of the interplay between gender and race, over time other identities and oppressions were added to the theory. For example, in 1981 [[Cherríe Moraga]] and [[Gloria E. Anzaldúa|Gloria Anzaldúa]] published the first edition of ''[[This Bridge Called My Back]]''. This anthology explored how classifications of sexual orientation and class also mix with those of race and gender to create even more distinct political categories. Many black, Latina, and Asian writers featured in the collection stress how their sexuality interacts with their race and gender to inform their perspectives. Similarly, poor women of color detail how their socio-economic status adds a layer of nuance to their identities, ignored or misunderstood by middle-class white feminists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Moraga|editor-first1=Cherríe|editor-last2=Anzaldúa|editor-first2=Gloria |editor-link1=Cherríe Moraga|editor-link2=Gloria E.

According to black feminists and many white feminists, experiences of class, gender, and sexuality cannot be adequately understood unless the influence of racialization is carefully considered. This focus on racialization was highlighted many times by scholar and feminist [[bell hooks]], specifically in her 1981 book ''Ain't I A Woman: Black Women and Feminism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = hooks | first = bell | author-link = bell hooks | title = Ain't I a Woman: black women and feminism | publisher = Pluto Press South End Press | location = London, Boston, Massachusetts | year = 1982 | isbn = 978-0-86104-379-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists argue that an understanding of intersectionality is a vital element of gaining political and social equality and improving our democratic system.&lt;ref&gt;D'Agostino, Maria; Levine, Helisse (2011), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=dkOypf17LjgC&amp;pg=PA8 Feminist theories and their application to public administration]", in {{cite book| editor-last1 = D'Agostino | editor-first1 = Maria | editor-last2 = Levine | editor-first2 = Helisse | title = Women in Public Administration: theory and practice | page=8 | publisher = Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning | location = Sudbury, Massachusetts | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780763777258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collins's theory represents the sociological crossroads between [[second-wave feminism|modern]] and [[Post-modern feminism|post-modern feminist thought]].&lt;ref name="Collins 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Collins | first = Patricia Hill | author-link = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Gender, black feminism, and black political economy | journal = [[Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]] | volume = 568 | issue = 1 | pages = 41–53 | doi = 10.1177/000271620056800105 | date = March 2000 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marie-Claire Belleau argues for "strategic intersectionality" in order to foster cooperation between feminisms of different ethnicities.&lt;ref name="Belleau, Marie-Claire 2007"&gt;Belleau, Marie-Claire (2007), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IuzvBBhq7-IC&amp;pg=PA51 'L'intersectionalité': Feminisms in a divided world; Québec-Canada]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Orr | editor-first1 = Deborah | title = Feminist Politics: identity, difference, and agency| pages = 51–62 | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | location = Lanham, Maryland | isbn = 978-0-7425-4778-0 | ref = harv |display-editors=etal| year = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51}} She refers to different ''nat-cult'' (national-cultural) groups that produce unique types of feminisms. Using [[Culture of Quebec|Québécois]] nat-cult as an example, Belleau says that many nat-cult groups contain infinite sub-identities within themselves, arguing that there are endless ways in which different feminisms can cooperate by using strategic intersectionality, and that these partnerships can help bridge gaps between "dominant and marginal" groups.&lt;ref name="Belleau, Marie-Claire 2007"/&gt;{{rp|54}} Belleau argues that, through strategic intersectionality, differences between nat-cult feminisms are neither essentialist nor universal, but should be understood as resulting from socio-cultural contexts. Furthermore, the performances of these nat-cult feminisms are also not essentialist. Instead, they are strategies.&lt;ref name="Belleau, Marie-Claire 2007"/&gt;

Similarly, Intersectional theorists like Vrushali Patil argue that intersectionality ought to recognize transborder constructions of racial and cultural hierarchies. About the effect of the state on identity formation, Patil says: "If we continue to neglect cross-border dynamics and fail to problematize the nation and its emergence via transnational processes, our analyses will remain tethered to the spatialities and temporalities of colonial modernity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patil|first=Vrushali|date=1 June 2013|title=From Patriarchy to Intersectionality: A Transnational Feminist Assessment of How Far We've Really Come|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=38|issue=4|pages=847–867|doi=10.1086/669560|jstor=10.1086/669560|issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marxist feminist critical theory ===
{{Marxism}}
[[W. E. B. Du Bois]] theorized that the intersectional paradigms of race, class, and nation might explain certain aspects of black political economy. Collins writes: "Du Bois saw race, class, and nation not primarily as personal identity categories but as social hierarchies that shaped African-American access to status, poverty, and power."&lt;ref name="Collins 2000"/&gt;{{rp|44}} Du Bois omitted gender from his theory and considered it more of a personal identity category.

Cheryl Townsend Gilkes expands on this by pointing out the value of centering on the experiences of black women. Joy James takes things one step further by "using paradigms of intersectionality in interpreting social phenomena". Collins later integrated these three views by examining a black political economy through the centering of black women's experiences and the use of a theoretical framework of intersectionality.&lt;ref name="Collins 2000"/&gt;{{rp|44}}

Collins uses a [[Marxist feminism|Marxist feminist]] approach and applies her intersectional principles to what she calls the "work/family nexus and black women's poverty". In her 2000 article "Black Political Economy" she describes how, in her view, the intersections of [[consumer racism]], gender hierarchies, and disadvantages in the labor market can be centered on black women's unique experiences. Considering this from a historical perspective and examining interracial marriage laws and property inheritance laws creates what Collins terms a "distinctive work/family nexus that in turn influences the overall patterns of black political economy".&lt;ref name="Collins 2000"/&gt;{{rp|45–46}} For example, [[anti-miscegenation laws]] effectively suppressed the upward economic mobility of black women.

The intersectionality of race and gender has been shown to have a visible impact on the labor market. "Sociological research clearly shows that accounting for education, experience, and skill does not fully explain significant differences in labor market outcomes."&lt;ref name="arjournals.annualreviews.org"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Browne | first1 = Irene | last2 = Misra | first2 = Joya | title = The intersection of gender and race in the labor market | journal = [[Annual Review of Sociology]] | volume = 29 | pages = 487–513 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100016 | date = August 2003 |jstor=30036977| ref = harv }} [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249558187_The_Intersection_of_Gender_and_Race_in_the_Labor_Market Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|506}} The three main domains in which we see the impact of intersectionality are wages, discrimination, and domestic labor. Those who experience privilege within the social hierarchy in terms of race, gender and socio-economic status are less likely to receive lower wages, to be subjected to stereotypes and discriminated against, or to be hired for exploitative domestic positions. Studies of the labor market and intersectionality provide a better understanding of economic inequalities and the implications of the multidimensional impact of race and gender on social status within society.&lt;ref name="arjournals.annualreviews.org"/&gt;{{rp|506–507}}

==Key concepts==
===Interlocking matrix of oppression===
Collins refers to the various intersections of social inequality as the [[matrix of domination]]. This is also known as "vectors of oppression and privilege".&lt;ref name="Ritzer 2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Ritzer|first1= George|author1-link = George Ritzer |last2=Stepinisky |first2=Jeffrey|title = Contemporary sociological theory and its classical roots: the basics|pages = 204–207|publisher = McGraw-Hill|location = New York|edition = 4th|year = 2013|isbn = 9780078026782 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|204}} These terms refer to how differences among people (sexual orientation, class, race, age, etc.) serve as oppressive measures towards women and change the experience of living as a woman in society. Collins, [[Audre Lorde]] (in ''[[Sister Outsider]]''), and [[bell hooks]] point towards either/or thinking as an influence on this oppression and as further intensifying these differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dudley | first = Rachel A. | title = Confronting the concept of intersectionality: the legacy of Audre Lorde and contemporary feminist organizations | journal = McNair Scholars Journal | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | page = 5 | date = 2006 | url = https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/mcnair/vol10/iss1/5/ | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Collins refers to this as the construct of dichotomous oppositional difference. This construct is characterized by its focus on differences rather than similarities.&lt;ref name="Collins 1986"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Collins | first = Patricia Hill | author-link = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Learning from the outsider within: the sociological significance of black feminist thought | journal = [[Social Problems]] | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = s14–s32 | doi = 10.2307/800672 | jstor = 800672 | date = December 1986 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|S20}}

===Standpoint epistemology and the outsider within===
Both Collins and [[Dorothy E. Smith|Dorothy Smith]] have been instrumental in providing a sociological definition of [[standpoint theory]]. A standpoint is an individual's unique world perspective. The theoretical basis of this approach views societal knowledge as being located within an individual's specific geographic location. In turn, knowledge becomes distinctly unique and subjective; it varies depending on the social conditions under which it was produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mann | first1 = Susan A. | last2 = Kelley | first2 = Lori R. | title = Standing at the crossroads of modernist thought: Collins, Smith, and the new feminist epistemologies | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 391–408 | doi = 10.1177/089124397011004002 | date = August 1997 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|392}}

The concept of the outsider within refers to a unique standpoint encompassing the [[Self (sociology)|self]], family, and society.&lt;ref name="Collins 1986"/&gt;{{rp|S14}} This relates to the specific experiences to which people are subjected as they move from a common cultural world (i.e., family) to that of modern society.&lt;ref name="Ritzer 2013" /&gt;{{rp|207}} Therefore, even though a woman—especially a Black woman—may become influential in a particular field, she may feel as though she does not belong. Their personalities, behavior, and cultural being overshadow their value as an individual; thus, they become the outsider within.&lt;ref name="Collins 1986"/&gt;{{rp|S14}}

===Resisting oppression===
Speaking from a [[critical theory|critical]] standpoint, Collins points out that Brittan and Maynard say "domination always involves the [[objectification]] of the dominated; all forms of oppression imply the devaluation of the subjectivity of the oppressed."&lt;ref name="Collins 1986"/&gt;{{rp|S18}} She later notes that self-valuation and self-definition are two ways of resisting oppression. Practicing [[self-awareness]] helps to preserve the self-esteem of the group that is being oppressed and allow them to avoid any dehumanizing outside influences.

Marginalized groups often gain a status of being an "other".&lt;ref name="Collins 1986"/&gt;{{rp|S18}} In essence, you are "an other" if you are different from what [[Audre Lorde]] calls the [[Normality (behavior)|mythical norm]]. "Others" are virtually anyone that differs from the societal [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] of an average white male. [[Gloria Anzaldúa]] theorizes that the sociological term for this is "[[othering]]", or specifically attempting to establish a person as unacceptable based on a certain criterion that fails to be met.&lt;ref name="Ritzer 2013" /&gt;{{rp|205}}

For example, in the period immediately after [[9/11]] researchers noted [[low birth weight]]s and other poor birth outcomes among Muslim and Arab Americans, a result they connected to the increased racial and religious discrimination of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lauderdale | first = Diane S. | title = Birth outcomes for Arabic-named women in California before and after September 11 | journal = [[Demography (journal)|Demography]] | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 185–201 | doi = 10.1353/dem.2006.0008 | date = February 2006 | ref = harv }} [http://www.rwj.harvard.edu/papers/Lauderdale.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have also argued that immigration policies can affect health outcomes through mechanisms such as [[Stress (biology)#Overview|stress]], restrictions on access to health care, and the [[social determinants of health]].&lt;ref name="Viruell-Fuentes et al 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Viruell-Fuentes |first1=Edna A. |last2=Miranda |first2=Patricia Y. |last3=Abdulrahim |first3=Sawsan | title = More than culture: Structural racism, intersectionality theory, and immigrant health | journal = [[Social Science &amp; Medicine]] | volume = 75 | issue = 12 | pages = 2099–2106 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.12.037 | pmid = 22386617 | date = December 2012 | ref = harv }} [http://sph.umd.edu/sites/default/files/files/che/Viruell%20Fuentes%20et%20al%202012%20SSM%20More%20than%20Culture%20Structural%20Racism.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, applications with regard to property and wealth can be traced to the American historical narrative that is filled "with tensions and struggles over property—in its various forms. From the removal of Native Americans (and later [[Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese Americans]]) from the land, to military conquest of the Mexicans, to the construction of Africans as property, the ability to define, possess, and own property has been a central feature of power in America&amp;nbsp;... [and where] social benefits accrue largely to property owners".&lt;ref name="Ladson-Billings Tate 1995"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ladson-Billings | first1 = Gloria | last2 = Tate IV | first2 = William F. | title = Toward a critical race theory of education (''id: 1410'') | journal = [[Teachers College Record]] | volume = 97 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–68 | date = 1995 | url = https://www.tcrecord.org/content.asp?contentid=1410 | ref = harv }} [http://hs.iastate.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Toward_a_Critical_Race_Theory_of_Education.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; One could apply the intersectionality framework analysis to various areas where race, class, gender, sexuality and ability are affected by policies, procedures, practices, and laws in "context-specific inquiries, including, for example, analyzing the multiple ways that race and gender interact with class in the labor market; interrogating the ways that states constitute regulatory regimes of identity, reproduction, and family formation";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cho |first1=Sumi |last2=Crenshaw |first2=Kimberlé Williams |last3=McCall |first3=Leslie | title = Toward a field of intersectionality studies: theory, applications, and praxis | journal = [[Signs (journal)|Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society]] | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 785–810 | doi = 10.1086/669608 | jstor = 10.1086/669608 | date = Summer 2013 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and examining the inequities in "the power relations [of the intersectionality] of whiteness&amp;nbsp;...

===Intersectionality in a global context===
Over the last couple decades in the European Union, there has been discussion regarding the intersections of social classifications and the need to acknowledge their functions. Before Crenshaw coined her definition of intersectionality, there was debate on what these societal categories were, and how they played a role in the lives of many minorities. What was once a more cut and dry categorization between gender, race, and class has turned into a multidimensional intersection of “race” including religion, sexuality, ethnicities, etc. In the EU and UK they refer to these intersections under the notion of multiple discrimination. The EU passed a non-discrimination law which addresses these multiple intersections; however, there is debate on whether the law is still proactively focusing on the proper inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Anna. European Union Non-Discrimination Law and Intersectionality : Investigating the Triangle of Racial, Gender and Disability Discrimination, edited by Dagmar Schiek, Routledge, 2011. ProQuest Ebook Central&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union is not the only organization that is acknowledging this concept. People around the world are taking a new approach when identifying others identities as well as their own; although, there are still places that follow the traditional process of categorization as stated in the following quote. “The impact of patriarchy and traditional assumptions about gender and families are evident in the lives of Chinese migrant workers (Chow, Tong), sex workers and their clients in South Korea (Shin), and Indian widows (Chauhan), but also Ukrainian migrants (Amelina) and Australian men of the new global middle class (Connell).”. &lt;ref&gt;Analyzing Gender, Intersectionality, and Multiple Inequalities : Global, Transnational and Local Contexts, edited by Esther Ngan-ling Chow, and Tan Lin, Emerald Publishing Limited, 2011. ProQuest Ebook Central&lt;/ref&gt; This text suggests that there are many more intersections of discrimination for people around the globe, than Crenshaw originally accounted for in her definition.

===Social work===
In the field of [[social work]], proponents of intersectionality hold that unless service providers take intersectionality into account, they will be of less use for various segments of the population, such as those reporting domestic violence or disabled victims of abuse. According to intersectional theory, the practice of [[domestic violence]] counselors in the [[United States]] urging all women to report their abusers to police is of little use to [[women of color]] due to the history of racially motivated [[police brutality]], and those counselors should adapt their counseling for women of color.&lt;ref&gt;Bent-Goodley, Tricia B.; Chase, Lorraine; Circo, Elizabeth A.; Antá Rodgers, Selena T. (2010), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IiRKrWlceK0C&amp;pg=PA77 Our survival, our strengths: understanding the experiences of African American women in abusive relationships]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Lockhart | editor-first1 = Lettie | editor-last2 = Danis | editor-first2 = Fran S. | title = Domestic violence intersectionality and culturally competent practice | page = 77 | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | isbn = 9780231140270 | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women with disabilities encounter more frequent domestic abuse with a greater number of abusers. Health care workers and personal care attendants perpetrate abuse in these circumstances, and women with disabilities have fewer options for escaping the abusive situation.&lt;ref name="Lochart_Danis_131"&gt;Cramer, Elizabeth P.; Plummer, Sara-Beth (2010), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IiRKrWlceK0C&amp;pg=PA131 Social work practice with abused persons with disabilities]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Lockhart | editor-first1 = Lettie | editor-last2 = Danis | editor-first2 = Fran S. | title = Domestic violence intersectionality and culturally competent practice | pages = 131–134 | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York| isbn = 9780231140270 | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a "silence" principle concerning the intersectionality of women and disability, which maintains an overall social denial of the prevalence of abuse among the disabled and leads to this abuse being frequently ignored when encountered.&lt;ref name="Chenoweth"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Chenoweth | first = Lesley | title = Violence and women with disabilities: silence and paradox | journal = [[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 391–411 | doi = 10.1177/1077801296002004004 | date = December 1996 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; A paradox is presented by the overprotection of people with disabilities combined with the expectations of promiscuous behavior of disabled women.&lt;ref name="Lochart_Danis_131" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chenoweth" /&gt; This leads to limited autonomy and social isolation of disabled individuals, which place women with disabilities in situations where further or more frequent abuse can occur.&lt;ref name="Lochart_Danis_131" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{POV|Section|date=October 2018}}

=== Methods and ideology ===
According to [[political theorist]] Rebecca Reilly-Cooper intersectionality relies heavily on [[standpoint theory]], which has its own set of criticisms. Intersectionality posits that an oppressed person is often the best person to judge their experience of oppression; however, this can create paradoxes when people who are similarly oppressed have different interpretations of similar events. Such paradoxes make it very difficult to synthesize a common actionable cause based on subjective testimony alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Reilly-Cooper | first = Rebecca |url=https://rebeccarc.com/2013/04/15/intersectionality-and-identity-politics/|title=Intersectionality and identity politics|date=15 April 2013|publisher=More Radical With Age|access-date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other narratives, especially those based on multiple intersections of oppression, are more complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kofi Bright | first1 = Liam  | last2 = Malinsky | first2 = Daniel | last3 = Thompson | first3 = Morgan |title= Causally interpreting intersectionality theory | journal = [[Philosophy of Science (journal)|Philosophy of Science]] | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 60–81 | doi = 10.1086/684173 | date = January 2016 | ref = harv }} [http://www.liamkofibright.com/uploads/4/8/9/8/48985425/causally_interpreting_intersectionality_theory_final.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Davis (2008) asserts that intersectionality is ambiguous and open ended, and that its "lack of clear-cut definition or even specific parameters has enabled it to be drawn upon in nearly any context of inquiry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Davis | first = Kathy | title = Intersectionality as buzzword: A sociology of science perspective on what makes a feminist theory successful | journal = [[Feminist Theory (journal)|Feminist Theory]] | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 67–85 | doi = 10.1177/1464700108086364 | date = April 2008 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rekia Jibrin and Sara Salem argue that intersectional theory creates a unified idea of anti-oppression politics that requires a lot out of its adherents, often more than can reasonably be expected, creating difficulties achieving [[Praxis (process)|praxis]]. They also say that intersectional philosophy encourages a focus on the issues inside the group instead of on society at large, and that intersectionality is "a call to complexity and to abandon over simplification... this has the parallel effect of emphasizing 'internal differences' over hegemonic structures."&lt;ref name="Rekia Jibrin 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jibrin | first1 = Rekia | last2 = Salem | first2 = Sara |title=Revisiting intersectionality: reflections on theory and praxis | journal = Trans-Scripts: An Interdisciplinary Online Journal in the Humanities and Social Sciences | volume = 5 | date = 2015 | url = http://sites.uci.edu/transscripts/2015-archives-2/ }} [http://sites.uci.edu/transscripts/files/2014/10/2015_5_salem.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|''See ''[[hegemony]] and [[cultural hegemony]].}}

Writing in the ''[[New Statesman]]'', Helen Lewis adds that in emphasizing internal differences over hegemonic structures, and having complex and at times contradictory recommendations, it can create paralysis because it is not very accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Lewis | first = Helen |title=The uses and abuses of intersectionality |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/helen-lewis/2014/02/uses-and-abuses-intersectionality |work=[[New Statesman]] |date=20 February 2014|access-date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[moral psychologist]] [[Jonathan Haidt]], in a speech at the [[American conservative]] think tank [[Manhattan Institute]], criticized the theory by saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;[In intersectionality] the binary dimensions of oppression are said to be interlocking and overlapping. America is said to be one giant matrix of oppression, and its victims cannot fight their battles separately. They must all come together to fight their common enemy, the group that sits at the top of the pyramid of oppression: the straight, white, cis-gendered, able-bodied Christian or Jewish or possibly atheist male. This is why a perceived slight against one victim group calls forth protest from all victim groups. This is why so many campus groups now align against Israel. Intersectionality is like NATO for social-justice activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.city-journal.org/html/age-outrage-15608.html|title=The Age of Outrage|date=17 December 2017|work=City Journal|author=Jonathan Haidt|access-date=6 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary inline|date=September 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Barbara Tomlinson, a PhD employed at the Department of Women's Studies at UC Santa Barbara, has been critical of the applications of intersectional theory, and identified several ways in which the conventional theory has been destructive to the movement. She asserts that the common practice of using intersectionality to attack other ways of feminist thinking and the tendency of academics to critique intersectionality instead of using intersectionality as a tool to critique other conventional ways of thinking has been a misuse of the ideas it stands for. Tomlinson argues that in order to use intersectional theory correctly, intersectional feminists must not only consider the arguments but the tradition and mediums through which these arguments are made, Conventional academics are likely to favor writings by authors or publications with prior established credibility instead of looking at the quality of each piece individually, contributing to negative stereotypes associated with both feminism and intersectionality by having weaker arguments in defense of feminism and intersectionality become prominent based on renown. She goes on to argue that this allows critics of intersectionality to attack these weaker arguments, “[reducing] intersectionality’s radical critique of power to desires for identity and inclusion, and offer a deradicalized intersectionality as an asset for dominant disciplinary discourses”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tomlinson | first = Barbara | title = To Tell the Truth and Not Get Trapped: Desire, Distance, and Intersectionality at the Scene of Argument | journal = Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 993-1017 | doi = 10.1086/669571 | date = Summer 2013 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===

{{Main|Biases|Heuristics in judgment and decision-making}}
Researchers in psychology have incorporated intersection effects since the 1950s{{Example needed|date=September 2018}}, long before the work of Patricia Hill Collins. Psychology incorporates these effects via the lenses of biases, heuristics, stereotypes, and judgments. Psychological interaction effects span a range of variables, although person by situation effects are the most examined category. As a result, psychologists do not construe the interaction effect of demographics such as gender and race as either more noteworthy or less noteworthy than any other interaction effect. In addition, oppression can be regarded as a subjective construct when viewed as an absolute hierarchy; even if an objective definition of oppression were reached, person-by-situation effects would make it difficult to deem certain persons or categories of persons as uniformly oppressed. For instance, black men are stereotypically perceived as violent, which may be a disadvantage in police interactions, but also as physically attractive,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lewis | first = Michael B. | title = A facial attractiveness account of gender asymmetries in interracial marriage | journal = [[PLOS ONE]] | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0031703  | date = 9 February 2012 | ref = harv | volume=7 | issue = 2 | pages=e31703 | pmid=22347504 | pmc=3276508}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lewis | first = Michael B. | title = Who is the fairest of them all? Race, attractiveness and skin color sexual dimorphism | journal = [[Personality and Individual Differences]] | volume = 50 | issue = 2 | pages = 159–162 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2010.09.018 | date = January 2011 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; which may be advantageous in romantic situations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Psychological studies have shown that the effect of multiplying "oppressed" identities is not necessarily additive, but rather interactive in complex ways. For instance, black gay men may be more positively evaluated than black heterosexual men, because the "feminine" aspects of gay stereotypes temper the hypermasculine and aggressive aspect of black stereotypes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Pedulla | first = David S. | title = The positive consequences of negative stereotypes: race, sexual orientation, and the job application process | journal = [[Social Psychology Quarterly]] | volume = 77 | issue = 1 | pages = 75–94 | doi = 10.1177/0190272513506229 | date = March 2014 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Remedios | first1 = Jessica D. | last2 = Chasteen | first2 = Alison L. | last3 = Rule | first3 = Nicholas O. | last4 = Plaks | first4 = Jason E. | title = Impressions at the intersection of ambiguous and obvious social categories: Does gay + Black = likable? | journal = [[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]] | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 1312–1315 | doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2011.05.015 | date = November 2011 | ref = harv | hdl = 1807/33199 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Dershowitz]], scholar of United States constitutional law and criminal law, answering a question on the [[criticism of Israel]] by intersectional movements he stated that the concept of intersectionality is an oversimplification of reality that makes LGBT activists stand in solidarity with advocates of [[Sharia]], even though Islamic law denies the rights of the former. He feels that identity politics does not evaluate ideas or individuals on the basis of the quality of their character. Dershowitz argues that in academia, intersectionality is taught with a large influence from antisemitism. He states that Jews are actually more liberal and supportive of equal rights than many other religious sects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Frommer | first = Rachel | title= Alan Dershowitz derides theory of intersectionality in Columbia lecture |url= http://freebeacon.com/culture/alan-dershowitz-derides-theory-intersectionality-columbia-lecture|date=28 September 2017|work = [[The Washington Free Beacon]] |access-date=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Writer and political pro-Israel activist [[Chloé Valdary]] considers intersectionality "a rigid system for determining who is virtuous and who is not, based on traits like skin color, gender, and financial status". Valdary also states:&lt;blockquote&gt;Intersectionality's greatest flaw is in reducing human beings to political abstractions, which is never a tendency that turns out well—in part because it so severely flattens our complex human experience, and therefore fails to adequately describe reality. As it turns out, one can be personally successful and still come from a historically oppressed community—or vice versa. The human experience is complex and multifaceted and deeper than the superficial ways in which intersectionalists describe it.&lt;ref&gt;Valdary, Chloé.  [http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/258364/what-farrakhan-shares-with-intersectional-left "What Farrakhan Shares With the Intersectional Left"] ''Tablet Magazine''.  26 March 2018.  28 March 0218.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Compared to abiding religious faiths===
Intersectionality's premises have been characterized by some [[right-libertarian]]-leaning skeptics as manifested similarly to religious faith. Notably, for example, conservative [[political commentator]] [[Andrew Sullivan]] has argued that intersectionality manifests itself "almost as a religion. It posits a classic orthodoxy through which all of human experience is explained—and through which all speech must be filtered. Its version of original sin is the power of some identity groups over others. To overcome this sin, you need first to confess, i.e., 'check your privilege,' and subsequently live your life and order your thoughts in a way that keeps this sin at bay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date = 10 March 2017|title = Is Intersectionality a Religion?|author = [[Andrew Sullivan]]|publisher = [[New York magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hotair.com/archives/2018/03/04/portland-state-university-panel-discussion-intersectionality-religion/|title=Portland State University panel discussion: 'Is Intersectionality a Religion?'|date=4 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David A. French]], writer for the ''[[National Review]]'', also agrees with Sullivan's conclusion, equating intersectionality's proponents to extremist Christian fundamentalists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politician [[David A. French|David French]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20180307030606/https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/03/intersectionality-the-dangerous-faith/ "Intersectionality, the Dangerous Faith"] (6 March 2018), ''National Review Online''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[France]] has one [[official language]], the [[French language]].  The [[French government]] does not regulate the choice of language in publications by individuals, but the use of French is required by law in commercial and workplace communications.  In addition to mandating the use of French in the territory of the Republic, the French government tries to promote French in the [[European Union]] and globally through institutions such as [[La Francophonie]].  The perceived threat from [[anglicisation]] has prompted efforts to safeguard the position of the French language in France.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Besides French, there exist many other vernacular minority [[languages of France]], both in [[European France]], in [[Overseas France]], and in French [[overseas territories]].  These languages are recognized by article 75-1 of the [[Constitution of France|French constitution]].&lt;ref name="regionsqu"&gt;Article 75-1: (a new article): "Les langues régionales appartiennent au patrimoine de la France" ("Regional languages belong to the patrimony of France"). See [[:fr:Loi constitutionnelle du 23 juillet 2008|Loi constitutionnelle du 23 juillet 2008]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In France proper, [[Corsican language|Corsican]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Gallo language|Gallo]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] have an official status in the regions where they are spoken.  The 1999 report&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/dglf/lang-reg/rapport_cerquiglini/langues-france.html Les langues de la France, Report of Bernard Cerquiglini]&lt;/ref&gt; written for the French government by [[Bernard Cerquiglini]] identified 75 languages (including just [[#Endangered_languages|eight]] in continental France proper) that would qualify for recognition were the government to ratify the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] (currently only signed but not ratified).

== History ==
The [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts]] of 1539 made French the administrative language of the kingdom of France for legal documents and laws. Previously, official documents were written in medieval [[Latin]], which was the language used by the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

===Académie française===
The [[Académie française]] was established in 1635 to act as the official authority on the usages, vocabulary, and grammar of the French language, and to publish an [[Dictionnaire de l'Académie française|official dictionary of the French language]]. Its recommendations however carry no legal power and are sometimes disregarded even by governmental authorities. In recent years the Académie has tried to prevent the [[Anglicisation]] of the French language.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.academie-francaise.fr/langue/index.html La langue française » La politique linguistique aujourd'hui] on the site of [[Académie française]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===French Revolution===
Prior to the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, French kings did not take a strong position on the language spoken by their subjects. However, in sweeping away the old provinces, [[parlement]]s and laws, the Revolution strengthened the unified system of administration across the state. At first, the revolutionaries declared liberty of language for all citizens of the Republic; this policy was subsequently abandoned in favour of the imposition of a common language which was to do away with the other languages of France. Other languages were seen as keeping the peasant masses in [[obscurantism]].

The new idea was expounded in the ''Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the [[patois]] and to universalise the use of the French language''. Its author, [[Henri Grégoire]], deplored that France, the most advanced country in the world with regard to politics, had not progressed beyond the [[Tower of Babel]] as far as languages were concerned, and that only three million of the 25 million inhabitants of France spoke a pure [[Parisian French]] as their native tongue. The lack of ability of the population to understand the language in which were the political debates and the administrative documents was then seen as antidemocratic.

The report resulted the same year in two laws which stated that the only language tolerated in France in public life and in schools would be French. Within two years, the French language had become the symbol of the national unity of the French State. However, the Revolutionaries lacked both time and money to implement a language policy.

===Third Republic===
In the 1880s, the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] sought to modernize France, and in particular to increase [[literacy]] and general knowledge in the population, especially the rural population, and established free compulsory [[primary education]]. The choice of French for education seemed natural, given that it was the only language widely spoken in France in which a sizable number of newspapers and historical, scientific etc. books were available. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The only language allowed in primary school was French. All other languages were forbidden, even in the schoolyard, and transgressions were severely punished.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge 2001: 218&lt;/ref&gt; After 1918, the use of [[German language|German]] in [[Alsace-Lorraine]] was outlawed. In 1925, [[Anatole de Monzie]], Minister of public education, stated that "for the linguistic unity of France, the [[Breton language]] [[language death|must disappear]]." As a result, the speakers of minority languages began to be [[vergonha|ashamed when using their own language]] – especially in the educational system – and over time, many families stopped teaching their language to their children and tried to [[language shift|speak only French with them]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} In neighbouring [[Belgium]], a parallel [[Francization of Brussels|policy to expand the use of standard French also took place]].

===Fourth Republic===
The 1950s were also the first time the French state recognised the right of the regional languages to exist. A law allowed for the teaching of [[regional language]]s in secondary schools, and the policy of repression in the primary schools came to an end. The Breton language began to appear in the media during this time.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Fifth Republic===
The French government allowed in 1964 for the first time one and a half minutes of Breton on regional television. But even in 1972, president [[Georges Pompidou]] declared that "there is no place for minority languages in a France destined to make its mark on Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Language and Nationalism in Europe |editor1-first=Stephen |editor1-last=Barbour |editor2-first=Cathie |editor2-last=Carmichael |coauthors= |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780191584077 |page=75 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ixmu8Iga7gC&amp;pg=PA75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 the constitution was amended to state explicitly that "the language of the Republic is French."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Modern French Culture |editor-last=Hewitt |editor-first=Nicholas |last= |first= |year=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=9780521794657 |page=141 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qczzKXFmPCYC&amp;pg=PA141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.senat.fr/evenement/revision/92-554.html |title=Loi constitutionnelle n° 92-554 du 25 juin 1992 |author= |language=French |year=2013 |origyear=1992 |publisher=[[Senate of France]] |work=Senat.fr |accessdate=28 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 a French subsidiary of a US company was fined €500,000 plus an ongoing fine of €20,000 per day for providing software and related technical documentation to its employees in English only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/labor/newsletter/intl/2006/Apr/france3.html |title=American Bar Association Report: French court fines US company for not using French language in France |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806073213/http://www.abanet.org/labor/newsletter/intl/2006/Apr/france3.html |archivedate=2009-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; See the [[Toubon Law]].

In 2008, a revision of the French constitution creating official recognition of regional languages was implemented by the Parliament in Congress at Versailles.&lt;ref name="regionsqu" /&gt;

==== The debate about the Council of Europe’s Charter for Regional or Minority Languages ====
In 1999 the Socialist government of [[Lionel Jospin]] signed the [[Council of Europe]]’s European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, but it was not ratified. The [[Constitutional Council of France]] declared that the Charter contains  unconstitutional provisions since the Constitution states that the language of the Republic is French.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/acces-par-date/decisions-depuis-1959/1999/99-412-dc/decision-n-99-412-dc-du-15-juin-1999.11825.html Décision n° 99-412 DC du 15 juin 1999]{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages is a European [[Treaty|convention]] (ETS 148) adopted in 1992 under the auspices of the Council of Europe to protect and promote historical [[regional language|regional]] and [[minority language|minority]] languages in [[Europe]], ratified and implemented by 25 States, but not by France, {{As of|2014|lc=on}}. The charter contains 98 articles of which signatories must adopt a minimum of 35 (France signed 39).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The signing, and the failure to have it ratified, provoked a public debate in French society over the charter.

More recently, in a letter to several deputies dated 4 June 2015, [[François Hollande]] announced the upcoming filing of a constitutional bill for the ratification of the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vers un projet de loi constitutionnelle pour ratifier la Charte des langues régionales |url=https://lemonde.fr/politique/article/2015/06/04/vers-un-projet-de-loi-constitutionnelle-pour-ratifier-la-charte-des-langues-regionales_4647527_823448.html |date=4 June 2015 |accessdate=1 November 2015 |work=[[Le Monde]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 30 July 2015, the [[Conseil d'État (France)|Council of State]] gave an unfavorable opinion on the charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=de Montvalon |first1=Jean-Baptiste |title=Nouvel obstacle à la ratification de la Charte des langues régionales |url=https://lemonde.fr/societe/article/2015/08/01/les-langues-regionales-bientot-reconnues-par-la-constitution_4707451_3224.html |date=1 August 2015 |accessdate=1 November 2015 |work=[[Le Monde]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 27 October 2015, the [[Senate (France)|Senate]] rejected the draft law on ratification of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] driving away the assumption of Congress for the adoption of the constitutional reform which would have given the value and legitimacy to regional languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Le Sénat dit non à la Charte européenne des langues régionales |url=http://www.franceinfo.fr/actu/politique/article/le-senat-rejette-le-projet-de-loi-de-ratification-de-la-charte-europeenne-des-langues-regionales-741405 |date=27 October 2015 |accessdate=1 November 2015 |work=franceinfo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Minority languages and endangered languages ==
Excluding the languages spoken in the [[Région d'outre-mer|overseas regions]] and other overseas territories, and the languages of recent immigrants, the following languages are spoken by sizeable minorities in France:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=FR Languages of France]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Romance languages]]: [[Caló language|Caló]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Corsican language|Corsican]], [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]], [[Langue d'oïl|Oïl languages]] (other than French), [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ([[Castilian Spanish]]), [[Gallo language|Gallo]].
* [[Germanic languages]]: [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Flemish]], [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]], and [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]].
* [[Celtic languages]]: [[Breton language|Breton]].
* [[Vasconic languages]]: [[Basque language|Basque]].
* [[Romani languages]].

The non-French [[Oïl languages]] and Franco-Provençal are highly endangered; because of their similarity to standard French, their speakers conformed {{clarify|text=in orthography, or in phonological production?|date=October 2017}} much more readily. The other languages are still spoken but are all considered endangered.

In the 1940s, more than one million people spoke Breton as their main language. The countryside in western [[Brittany]] was still overwhelmingly Breton-speaking. Today, about 170,000 people are able to speak Breton (around 8% of the population in the traditionally Breton speaking area), most of whom are elderly. Other regional languages have generally followed the same pattern; Alsatian and Corsican have resisted better, while Occitan has followed an even worse trend.

Accurate information on the state of language use is complicated by the inability (due to constitutional provisions) of the state to ask language use questions in the [[census]].

Since the rejection of ratification of the European Charter, French governments have offered token support to regional languages within the limits of the law. The ''Délégation générale à la langue française'' ([[General Delegation for the French language and the languages of France|General delegation of the French tongue]]) has acquired the additional function of observing and studying the languages of France and has had "et aux langues de France" (...and languages of France) added to its title.

The French government hosted the first ''Assises nationales des langues de France'' in 2003{{citation needed span|text=|date=January 2012}}, but this national round table on the languages of France served to highlight the contrast between cultural organisations and language activists on the one hand and the state on the other.

The [[decentralization]] has not extended to giving power in language policy to the regions.

== Opposition to language policy ==
[[Image:Col de Teghime et D81.jpg|thumb|This roadsign in Corsica has had the non-Corsican placenames defaced by [[National Front for the Liberation of Corsica|FLNC]] supporters ]]
France presents itself as a big country struggling for [[cultural diversity]] against the predominance of [[English language|English]] in international affairs. According to French republican ideology (see also [[Laïcité]]), all ''citizens'' are equal and therefore no ''groups'' may exercise extra rights; this is an idea stemming from the [[French Revolution]], contrasting with the previous situation in which many groups had special rights and privileges.

This policy of cultural homogeneity has been challenged from both the right wing and the left wing. In the 1970s, nationalist or regionalist movements emerged in regions such as Brittany, Corsica and Occitania. Even though they remain a minority, networks of schools teaching France's regional languages have arisen, such as the [[Diwan (school)|Diwan]] in [[Brittany]], the [[Ikastola]] in the [[French Basque Country|Basque Country]], the [[Calandreta]] in [[Occitania]], and the [[La Bressola]] schools in [[Northern Catalonia]].

Despite popular demand for official recognition, regional language teaching is not supported by the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurolang.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3077&amp;Itemid=1 Meet the French, strong supporters of regional languages – Eurolang] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109222240/http://www.eurolang.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3077&amp;Itemid=1 |date=2014-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in certain areas, such as Brittany, regional councils maintain bilingual public schools as far as it is within the law. Other Breton education is provided by [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] schools and private schools, Dihun and [[Diwan (school)|Diwan]], respectively.  In 2011, only 14,000 pupils were enrolled in French-Breton bilingual schools, although this number reflected an increase of around 30% from the year 2006, when the number of pupils was just over 11,000.  The Ofis Publik ar Brezhoneg also reported in 2011 that a further 16,000 students from early childhood to adulthood were learning Breton as a second language (at primary schools, collèges, lycées, university or evening courses), bringing the total number of Breton learners to at least 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofis-bzh.org/fr/enseignement/index.php Ofis Publik ar Brezhoneg - L'enseignment]&lt;/ref&gt;

A long campaign of defacing road signs led to the first bilingual road signs in the 1980s. These are now increasingly common in Brittany, because of the help given by the [[Ofis ar Brezhoneg]] in bilingualizing many road, town hall and other official signs.

As far as the media are concerned, there is still little Breton to be found on the airwaves, although since 1982 a few Breton-speaking radio stations have been created on an associative basis. The launching of the Breton [[TV Breizh]] in 2000 was intended to offer wider coverage of Breton. However, Breton-language programme schedules gradually decreased in favour of French-language broadcasting, until in 2010 they totally disappeared.

In Corsica, the 1991 "Joxe Statute", in setting up the Collectivité Territoriale de Corse, also provided for the [[Corsican Assembly]], and charged it with developing a plan for the optional teaching of Corsu. At the primary school level Corsu is taught up to a fixed number of hours per week (three in the year 2000) and is a voluntary subject at the secondary school level,&lt;ref&gt;(French) [http://www.ac-corse.fr/lcc_20/file/1890/ Dispositif académique d’enseignement de la langue corse dans le premier degré, année scolaire 2010-2011], Academy of Corsica&lt;/ref&gt; but is required at the [[University of Corsica Pascal Paoli|University of Corsica]].

There is some opposition to the [[Loi Toubon]] mandating the use of French (or at least a translation into French) in commercial advertising and packaging, as well as in some other contexts.

{{Judicial interpretation}}
In [[Canadian law]], the '''living tree doctrine''' ({{Lang-fr|théorie de l'arbre vivant}}) is a [[legal doctrine|doctrine]] of constitutional interpretation that says that a constitution is organic and must be read in a broad and progressive manner so as to adapt it to the changing times.

== Concept ==
The living tree doctrine has been deeply entrenched into Canadian constitutional law since the seminal constitutional case of ''[[Edwards v Canada (Attorney General)]]'' also widely known as the ''Persons Case'' wherein [[John Sankey, 1st Viscount Sankey|Viscount Sankey]] stated in the 1929 decision: "The [[British North America Act]] planted in Canada [is] a living tree capable of growth and expansion within its natural limits." This is known as the Doctrine of Progressive Interpretation. This means that the Constitution cannot be interpreted in the same way as an ordinary statute. Rather, it must be read within the context of society to ensure that it adapts and reflects changes. If constitutional interpretation adheres to the [[original intent|Framer's Intent]] and remains rooted in the past, the Constitution would not be reflective of society and eventually fall into disuse. 

{{quote|
The "frozen concepts" reasoning runs contrary to one of the most fundamental principles of Canadian constitutional interpretation: that our Constitution is a living tree which, by way of progressive interpretation, accommodates and addresses the realities of modern life....

Lord Sankey LC’s reference to "natural limits" did not impose an obligation to determine, in the abstract and absolutely, the core meaning of constitutional terms....&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Reference re Same-Sex Marriage|link=Reference re Same-Sex Marriage|year=2004|court=scc|num=79|pinpoint=par. 22, 28|parallelcite=[2004] 3 SCR 698|date=2004-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

However, "natural limits" cannot be granted too elastic a definition. In the [[Bank of Montreal v. Marcotte|Marcotte trilogy]], it was held that payments by [[credit card]] could not be considered to fall within the federal [[bills of exchange]] power, as there had been no shift in how a bill of exchange is defined in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Marcotte v. Fédération des caisses Desjardins du Québec|year=2014|court=scc|num=57|pinpoint=par. 21|date = 2014-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charter ==
The interpretation of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] also makes use of the living tree doctrine.  Chief Justice [[Antonio Lamer]] stated in ''[[Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act]]'', "If the newly planted 'living tree' which is the Charter is to have the possibility of growth and adjustment over time, care must be taken to ensure that historical materials, such as the Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence of the Special Joint Committee, do not stunt its growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act|link=Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act|year=1985|court=scc|num=81|format=canlii|pinpoint=par. 53|parallelcite=[1985] 2 SCR 486|date=1985-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary V. Riley''' (December 24, 1908 – October 5, 1987) was an [[Apache]] tribal council member who was instrumental in the economic development of the [[White Mountain Apache]] Tribe. She was the first woman to be elected to serve on the tribal council and worked toward bringing timber and tourism industries to the reservation to ensure their economic stability. She was inducted into the [[Arizona Women's Hall of Fame]] posthumously in 1988.

==Early life==
Mary Velasquez was born on December 24, 1908{{#tag:ref|The 1916 Indian Census gives her birth date as December 20, 1908.{{sfn|U.S. Indian Census|1916|p=339}} (Note, this family reference on various census reports is R-24).{{sfn|U.S. Indian Census|1909|p=151}}|group="Notes"}} at Fort Apache, on the [[Fort Apache Indian Reservation|White Mountain Apache Reservation]]{{sfn|Arizona Women's Hall of Fame|1988}} to Nalatzalay (Belle née Ivins) and Jesus Velasquez.{{sfn|U.S. Indian Census|1909|p=151}}{{sfn|Arizona Women's Hall of Fame|1988}}{{sfn|Arizona Death Records|October 1, 1943}} Her father was born in [[Fort Davis, Texas]] to Mexican nationals from [[Coahuila]], Martín and Juana (née Rivers) Velasquez,{{sfn|Arizona Death Records|October 24, 1943}} and came to Fort Apache traveling with soldiers from Ft. Davis, as a child with his mother. He worked for a time as a translator and scout{{sfn|Richens|1977}}{{sfn|Cavanaugh|1960|p=1}} and then managed a ranch where he provided supplies to the soldiers at the fort.{{sfn|Arizona Women's Hall of Fame|1988}} Her mother was a full-blood Apache and the daughter of Nadischaay.{{sfn|U.S. Indian Census|1909|p=151}} Velasquez and her siblings grew up on their father's farm, helping with farm chores. She attended three years of school, but was forced to leave in the [[1918 flu pandemic]] to help with sick relatives.{{sfn|Arizona Women's Hall of Fame|1988}}

Though she was unable to return to school, Velasquez became fluent in three languages: [[Apache language|Apache]], Spanish, and English. She read newspapers widely.{{sfn|Arizona Women's Hall of Fame|1988}}{{sfn|Adley-SantaMaria|1999|p=16}} Velasquez first married Kurt Johnson{{sfn|''The White Mountain Independent''|2012}} and then around 1936,{{sfn|White|1986|p=10}} married Peter Kessay Riley,{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1987|p=53}}{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1990|p=11}} with whom she raised her five children, all of whom were also trilingual, and to whom she stressed the importance of gaining an education.{{sfn|Arizona Women's Hall of Fame|1988}}{{sfn|Adley-SantaMaria|1999|p=16}} She farmed as her father had, raising corn, potatoes, pumpkin and squash, as well as turkey, goat and sheep.{{sfn|White|1986|p=10}}

==Tribal career==
In 1958, Riley became the first woman elected to serve on the White Mountain Apache Tribal Council.{{sfn|Arizona Women's Hall of Fame|1988}} She served on the health, education and welfare committee of the tribe and at various times, chaired the committee.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1960|p=15}}{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1963|p=8}} She made numerous trips to both the state capital, [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and federal capital in [[Washington, D. C.]], lobbying on behalf of the tribe.{{sfn|Cavanaugh|1960|p=1}}{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1985|p=256}} In an effort to improve situations for tribal members, she evaluated many programs for both economic and socio-cultural gains, looking at federal programs such as [[Job Corps]]{{sfn|MacEarian|1965|p=40}} the [[Boy Scouts of America]],{{sfn|''The Arizona Daily Sun''|1959|p=8}} and [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] loan programs for economic development. Riley represented three districts of the reservation{{sfn|Rolland|1972|p=26}} and was instrumental in projects, such as the Alchesay-Williams Creek National Fish Hatchery Complex, the Fort Apache Timber Company (FATCO), and the [[Sunrise Park Resort|Sunrise Park Ski Resort and Hotel]], among others, to expand the tribal enterprises and provide economic stability for the tribe.{{sfn|White|1986|p=10}}{{sfn|McDowell|1967|p=132}}{{sfn|Rolland|1972|p=26}}

Ground was broken for FATCO in 1962 and by 1963 had replaced the hiring of outside operators to manage the timber reserves of the tribe. By managing their own lumber harvests and operating three saw mills, the tribe was able to provide both jobs for tribal members and goods to sell to a wider clientele.{{sfn|Sheridan|Parezo|1996|p=89}}{{sfn|Cavanaugh|1962|p=12}} Around the same time, the Alchesay-Williams Hatchery was developed to stock the local lakes which had been created on the reservation and protect species listed as [[Threatened species|threatened]] or [[Endangered species|endangered]]. Employment opportunities for tribal members were increased through jobs at the hatchery, related jobs in the tourism sector, and additional revenues were garnered through the sale of fishing licenses.{{sfn|Behnke|2010|p=129}} One of the largest projects was to convert 1.6 million acres of their lands into the Sunrise Park Resort. Constructing 20 recreational lakes, campsites, fishing and hunting venues, a ski resort, and hotels, the Tribal Council utilized their lands to generate a year-round tourist industry.{{sfn|Rolland|1972|p=26}}{{sfn|McDowell|1967|p=132}}

Riley was interviewed as part of an [[Oral history preservation|Oral History Project]] sponsored by the Arizona State Department of Libraries and Archives in 1977.{{sfn|Richens|1977|p=1-2}} After twenty years on the council, Riley retired in 1978.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1985|p=256}} She was honored by the state in 1984 during the Statehood Day Celebrations for her leadership and development.{{sfn|''The Arizona Daily Star''|1984|p=14}} Profits from FATCO were used to build the Mary V. Riley Building, which houses the tribal educational department.{{sfn|Sheridan|Parezo|1996|p=89}}

==Death and legacy==
Riley died on October 5, 1987 at White Mountain River Indian Hospital in [[Whiteriver, Arizona]].{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1987|p=53}} Posthumously, she was inducted into the [[Arizona Women's Hall of Fame]], in 1988.{{sfn|Conner|1988|p=43}}

'''Mayabheda''', ([[Sanskrit]]:मायाभेद:), means the breaching or removal of [[Avidya (Hinduism)|Avidya]] ("ignorance"). It means the destruction of the illusion caused by [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] which occurs coinciding with the gain/dawn of Right Knowledge, the knowledge of [[Brahman]]. The [[Rig Veda]] [[Sukta]] R.V.X.177 addressed to Mayabheda in its three [[Mantra]]s in its own cryptic way serves this purpose. The central theme of this hymn is the discernment of [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] or illusion, the cause of material creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Golden Book of Rig Veda|author=Mahendra Kulsreshta|publisher=Lotus Press|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OIoRWGSfMikC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=mayabheda&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nbu2_jYEc_&amp;sig=dZSSmoKuGtOsnFA1oehkp3yH9Yw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DjgKUa60NMyNrgfOx4DQDg&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=mayabheda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayabheda is also one of the [[Rigvedic deities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Echoes of Ancient Indian Wisdom|author=Shantha N.Nair|publisher=Pustak Mahalpage=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ekehXVP3W8wC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=mayabheda&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=onpqmD8P2h&amp;sig=NnEAytNH2aycwyb-4Bwd90GK3Ig&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hjwKUeyROpHqrQehs4HwBA&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=mayabheda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About Sukta R.V.X.177==

The [[Rig Veda]] is an ancient anthology of [[Sanskrit]] poems mostly in the form of prayers to the [[Vedic]] gods. It consists of Ten Books or [[Mandala]]s. The [[Mandala 10|Tenth Mandala]] contains 191 Suktas addressed to [[Agni]], [[Indra]] and many other deities. The [[Purusha sukta]] (R.V.90), the [[Hiranyagarbha sukta]] (R.V.X.121) and the [[Nasadiya Sukta]] (R.V.X.129) are a part of this Mandala in which there are many more important hymns.

The Tenth Mandala of the Rig Veda also contains Sukta R.V.X.177 of [[Rishi]] Patanga Prajapati which is addressed to the [[Rigvedic deities|Vedic deity]], '''Mayabheda'''. It is a very short ''[[Sukta]]'' consisting of just three [[mantra]]s. The first mantra is in ''Jagati'' ''[[Vedic meter|chhanda]]'' to be sung or recited in ''Nishad'' ''[[Swara]]'', the second mantra is in ''Virat-trishtup'' '' [[Vedic meter|chhanda]]''  to be sung in ''Dhaivata'' ''[[Swara]]'' and the third, in ''Nichrit-trishtup'' ''[[Vedic meter|chhanda]]'' also to be sung in ''Dhaivata'' ''[[Swara]]''. The third mantra also appears in the First Mandala in the "Riddle Hymn" as Sukta R.V.I.164.31 in the hymn addressed to the ''Vishwadevas'', in which regard it is said that in this mantra is to be found the culminating point of the whole doctrine of the Transmigration of souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A constructive survey of Upanishadic philosophy|author=Ramachandra Dattatreya Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|page=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LyRKQwAACAAJ&amp;dq=A+constructive+survey+of+upanishadic+philosophy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0iisUMbvOavPmAW8yoCABw&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:a) The sapient with their spirit and their mind behold the Bird adorned with all an Asura’s magic might. Sages observe him in the ocean’s inmost depth: the wise disposers seek the station of his rays.
: b) The wise behold with their mind in their heart the Sun, made manifest by the illusion of the Asura. The sages look into the solar orb, the ordainers desire the region of his rays.
:c) The one who has entered the [[Prana]], who is the Prana of the Pranas, owing to His grace the wise ones whole-heartedly (devotedly) observe with great interest the constant (observable) activity in the life (empirical existence) of the [[Jiva]] (the individual self); but those who are blessed with sharper and deeper insight are able to see stationed within (merged with) the Lord (the supreme Self) all those Jivas that have attained [[moksha]] (liberation); therefore, the wise adore the Lord who rests shining ever so brightly.

::'''तां द्योतमानां स्वर्यं मनीषामृतस्य पदे कवयो नि पान्ति ||''' ||2||

:a) The flying Bird bears Speech within his spirit: erst the Gandharva in the womb pronounced it. And at the seat of sacrifice the sages cherish their radiant, heavenly-bright invention.
: b) The Sun bears the word in his mind; the Gandharva has spoken it within the wombs; sages cherish it in the place of sacrifice, brilliant, heavenly, ruling the mind.
:c) The Jiva sincerely employs its ability to speak ("speech"); the speech which emerges from within in the form of (various/numerous) words is impelled by the Prana residing within the body having been inspired by it; the all-spreading brilliant light-rays and the vibrant air (collectively) together gathering that word-form speech lifts that speech carrying it to all corners of space (for it to be heard).

::'''अपश्यं गोपाम निद्यमानमा च परा च पथिश्चरन्तम |'''
::'''स्ध्रीचि: स विषूचीर्वसान आ वरीवर्ति भुवनेष्वन्तः ||''' ||3||

:a) I saw the Herdsman, him who never resteth, approaching and departing on his pathways. He, clothed in gathered and diffusive splendour, within the worlds continuously travels.
: b) I beheld the protector, never descending, going by his paths to the east and the west; clothing the quarters of the heaven and the intermediate spaces. He constantly revolves in the midst of the worlds.
:c) The lord of the senses, the all-knowing one, as the witness, watches the imperishable Jiva who in accordance with its past and present works is repeatedly born in this world and passes through many types of agreeable and disagreeable births.

==Import==

According to the ''Asvalayana Srauta Sutra'' IV.6, Mantra ||2|| of this Rigvedic hymn is the inviting verse of the immolated to ''Vac'' (speech), and is used in the ''parvargya rites'' along with Mantra ||3||. Mantra ||1|| does refer directly to the Sun. In the Vidhana literature the richness and ambivalence contained within the rite is lost when vide IV.115 it is said that one should constantly mutter that which is destructive of ignorance (''ajnanabheda''), and which begins with ''patangam'' (the mantras of R.V.X.177) which hymn is indeed destructive of illusion (''mayabheda'') and repels all sorts of illusion; and vide IV.116 it is suggested that one should, by means of this hymn, prevent illusion, be that of ''Sambara'' or ''[[Indrajala]]''; one should, by means of this, ward off the illusion caused by unseen beings. Here the enemy is one that can create maya, and interfere with the abilities to discern what is true and what is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bringing the Gods to Mind:Mantra and Ritual in Early Indian Sacrifice|author=Laurie L. Patton|publisher=University of California Press|page=132|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gSZmbbsg9bEC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=mayabheda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1T0KUZLUDsPYrQeGqYCQAg&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=mayabheda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language of the Rig Veda is no ordinary language. Moreover, the meaning that is not found in the ordinary language but is in a poet’s language is to be found in its words. Thus, in the first mantra the [[Jiva]], the individual self, is referred to as ''antah''. The expression ''asurasyah'' refers to [[Brahman]], the Prana of all pranas, the Life-principle, that having entered the body brings it to life as the individual self. Those having already gained the highest knowledge see the individual self within the universal self, meaning, they do not see any difference between the [[Jiva]], the [[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]], and the [[Paramatman]] whom they adore as the Light of all lights. These are the three threads that have been used to weave the entire fabric of Indian thought. In the second mantra the word ''patanga'' stands for the Jiva, the embodied soul, who resorts to speech only when he wants to speak; the [[Prana]], the Life-principle, which governs the mind and all feelings of the heart, infuses meanings and makes speech be heard. The third mantra talks about the learned person who constantly sees (notices) the eternal ''Jivatman'' without undergoing any change passing through many births in accordance with the past [[karmas]]. The Sanskrit expression ''gopam'' used in this mantra refers to the controller of the senses [[Brahman]], the Sole Witness of all activities, but this word also refers to those liberated souls who continuously witness the repeated transmigrations of the unliberated souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|author=Ravinder kumar Soni|publisher=GBD Books|page=190,191|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Illumination_Of_Knowledge.html?id=dXZJXwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wash Edward Hale the first mantra could refer to the myth of the ''[[Svarbhanu]]'' hiding the Sun with darkness until it was found by the [[Atri]]s; if so, this is the only occurrence of ''asura'', in the singular, referring to a mythological evil or demonic being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Asura:In Early Vedic Religion|author= Wash Edward Hale|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=78|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wN6dz2UZkw4C&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=mayabheda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1T0KUZLUDsPYrQeGqYCQAg&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=mayabheda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

===Philosophy===
I. ''Ideals and Aims of [[Interpretation (philosophy)|Interpretation]]''. Michael Krausz’s interests in the theory of interpretation address the following cluster of questions.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz, “Interpretation and Its Objects: A Synoptic View,” chap. 2.  In Andreea Deciu Ritivoi, ed., ''Interpretation and Its Objects: Studies in the Philosophy of Michael Krausz''. Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; For such cultural phenomena as works of [[art]], [[music]], [[literature]], and the [[self]], can a single admissible interpretation exist? Or, for such phenomena, can a multiplicity of admissible interpretations exist?&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz, ''Rightness and Reasons: Interpretation in Cultural Practices'', Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1993, chap. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; For such phenomena, can opposing interpretations be jointly defended?&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz. “Interpretation and Its Objects,” chap. 7. In Michael Krausz, ed. ''Is There A Single Right Interpretation?'' Philadelphia: Penn State University Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Does interpretive activity affect the nature and number of that which is interpreted?&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, ''Rightness and Reasons'', chap. 3, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz, ''Interpretation and Transformation: Explorations in Art and the Self''. Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2007, chap. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Does interpretation aim for the elucidation of its objects, the edification of its interpreters, or both?&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz, ''Limits of Rightness'', Lanham, Md.: Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, 2000, chap. 11&lt;/ref&gt; How does the question of singularity or multiplicity of admissible interpretations bear on the singularity or multiplicity of life paths and projects?&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, ''Interpretation and Transformation'', chap. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Singularism asserts that objects of interpretation always answer to one and only one ideal interpretation.  In contrast, multiplism asserts that objects of interpretation may answer to more than one opposed interpretation. Both singularism and multiplism require that competing interpretations address one and the same object of interpretation. Where different interpretations address different objects of interpretation, an innocuous pluralism occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, ''Rightness and Reasons'', chap. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Where objects of interpretation cannot be delineated as to number, neither singularism nor multiplism can apply.&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, ''Interpretation and Transformation'', chap. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Krausz probes the relation between these ideals of interpretation and their ontologies.&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, “Interpretation and Its Objects.”&lt;/ref&gt; Singularism and multiplism are each compatible with either [[Philosophical realism|realism]] or [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]]. Singularism does not uniquely [[logical consequence|entail]] realism (and vice versa) and multiplism does not uniquely entail constructivism (and vice versa). Orthodox combinations include singularist-realism and multiplist-constructivism.Heterodox combinations include singularist-constructivism and multiplist-realism.&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, “Interpretation and Its Objects.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Krausz affirms that the contest between singularism and multiplism is logically detachable from the contest between realism and constructivism.&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, ''Limits of Rightness'', chap. 4,5.&lt;/ref&gt; He further shows that the contest between singularism and multiplism is detachable from a range of other ontologies that fall under the reconciliatory heading of “constructive realism.”&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, ''Limits of Rightness'', chap. 5–9&lt;/ref&gt;  None of the ontologies in Krausz’s inventory of constructive realisms uniquely entails either singularism or multiplism (and vice versa).  Yet Krausz denies that his “detachability thesis” demonstrates that ontology as such is unnecessary for the theory of interpretation.  For the question of the countability of objects of interpretation as well as interpretations themselves is ontological.&lt;ref&gt;Krausz. “Interpretation and Its Objects.”&lt;/ref&gt; Krausz extends the notion of ideals of interpretation to ideals of life paths or projects, such as self-realization.&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, ''Interpretation and Transformation'', chap. 9, 10&lt;/ref&gt; That is, directional singularism is the view that for a given person there is one admissible life path, and directional multiplism is the view that for a given person there may be more than one admissible life path. He develops the idea of directional multiplism from a non-essentialist or non-foundational view of human nature.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz, ''Limits of Rightness'', chap. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

II. ''[[Relativism]]''. In addition, Krausz’s work on relativism canvasses the range and significance of relativistic doctrines and rehearses their virtues and vices.  He considers relativism as the claim that [[truth]], [[good and evil|goodness]], or [[beauty]] (among other values) is relative to some reference frame, and no absolute standards to adjudicate between reference frames exist. He defines and differentiates various strands of [[Universality (philosophy)|absolutism]]: [[Philosophical realism|realism]], [[universalism]] and [[foundationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz, “Mapping Relativisms,” chap. 1. In Michael Krausz, ed., ''Relativism: A Contemporary Anthology''. New York: Columbia University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Krausz argues that when these strands of absolutism are unwoven, and when relativism is understood as the negation of these strands, classical self-refutation arguments against relativism do not apply.&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, “Mapping Relativisms.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz, “The Debate,” chap. 1. In Michael Krausz and Rom Harré, eds. Varieties of Relativism. Oxford: Basil Blackwell Publishers, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, Krausz considers whether the idea of “undifferentiated [[wikt:unity|unity]]” survives the relativist challenge. He suggests that the assertion of undifferentiated unity, instanced for example in some Asian soteriologies, is compatible with relativism as here he defines it.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Krausz, ''Dialogues on Relativism, Absolutism, and Beyond: Four Days in India'', Lanham, Md.: Rowman and Littlefield, 2011, Day Four.&lt;/ref&gt;

Krausz studied violin with Cleveland Orchestra concertmaster Josef Gingold. He received his early conducting coaching from his father, Laszlo Krausz, noted violist with l'Orchestre de la Suisse Romande and the Cleveland Orchestra, and conductor of the Akron Symphony Orchestra. Frederik Prausnitz of the Peabody Conservatory, and Luis Biava, Resident Conductor Laureate of the Philadelphia Orchestra also coached Michael Krausz. Krausz has been guest conductor of professional orchestras in Bulgaria, including the Pleven, Vratsa and Plovdiv Philharmonic Orchestras.

===Art===
[[File:End of texts3.jpg|thumb|125px|right| &lt;center&gt;End of Texts 35"x26"&lt;/center&gt;]]Michael Krausz has had thirty-three solo and duo shows in galleries in the U.S., U.K., and India, and he has participated in many group exhibitions. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (F.R.S.A.) in 1973. Krausz studied at the Philadelphia College of Art and Haystack Mountain School of Crafts.  He was Resident Fellow at the Ossabaw Foundation. Krausz's artworks have been reproduced in numerous publications including the British journal, ''Leonardo''. He is a member of Artist's Exchange, DE, and Delaware by Hand, which, in 2009, awarded him the status of “Master.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Master Artisans| work =| publisher =Delaware By Hand| date =| url =http://www.delawarebyhand.org/master_artisans.htm| doi =| accessdate =September 27, 2010| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20101120053534/http://delawarebyhand.org/master_artisans.htm| archivedate =November 20, 2010| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krausz's paintings depict various spatial planes at once, embodying scripted messages of no literal significance. They are concerned with the emergence and dissolution of ciphers in infinite spaces. The works embody a kind of automatic writing arising from conductorial musical gestures in meditative spaces. The paintings are done with dry pigment on museum board and other mixed media.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9244">'''Model-based enterprise''' (MBE) is a term used in manufacturing, to describe a strategy where an annotated digital three-dimensional (3D) [[3D modeling#Models|model]] of a product serves as the authoritative information source for all activities in that [[Product lifecycle|product's lifecycle]].&lt;ref name=NIST1753&gt;[http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/TechnicalNotes/NIST.TN.1753.pdf "Model Based Enterprise / Technical Data Package Summit Report"]. NIST Technical Note 1753. Retrieved 27 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gupta|first1=Isha|title=3D Product &amp; Manufacturing Information Implications for Design for Manufacturing|url=https://www.pddnet.com/article/2016/03/3d-product-manufacturing-information-implications-design-manufacturing|website=Product Design and Development|publisher=Advantage Business Media|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key advantage of MBE is that it replaces 2D drawings. In MBE, a single 3D model contains all the information typically found on in an entire set of engineering drawings, including geometry, topology, dimensions, tolerances, materials, finishes, and weld call-outs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Chad|title=The Model Based Enterprise (MBE) Study|url=http://www.lifecycleinsights.com/study/the-model-based-enterprise-mbe-study/|website=Lifecycle Insights|publisher=Lifecycle Insights|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MBE was originally championed by the aerospace and defense industries, with the automotive industry following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gray|first1=Scott|title=Model Based Enterprise|url=http://www.aiag.org/quality/model-based-enterprise/model-based-enterprise|website=aiag|publisher=Automotive Industry Action Group|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been adopted by many manufacturers around the world, in a wide range of industries. Significant benefits for manufacturers include reduced time to market and savings in production costs from improved tool design and fabrication, fewer overall assembly hours, less rework, streamlined development and better collaboration on engineering changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rouse|first1=Margaret|title=Model-based enterprise|url=http://searchmanufacturingerp.techtarget.com/definition/model-based-enterprise|website=TechTarget|publisher=TechTarget|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two prerequisites to implementing MBE: The first is the creation of annotated 3D models, known as a [[Model-based definition|Model-based definitions (MBD)]]. This requires the use of a [[Computer aided design|CAD]] system capable of creating precise [[Solid modeling|solid models]], with [[Product and manufacturing information|product and manufacturing information (PMI)]], a form of 3D annotation which may include dimensions, [[Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing|GD&amp;T]], notes, surface finish, and material specifications. (The mechanical CAD systems used in aerospace, defense, and automotive industries generally have these capabilities.) The second prerequisite is transforming MBDs into a form where they can be used in downstream lifecycle activities. As a rule, CAD models are stored in proprietary data formats, so they must be translated to a suitable MBD-compatible standard format, such as 3D [[PDF]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://3dpdfconsortium.org/ 3D PDF Consortium]&lt;/ref&gt; [[JT (visualization format)|JT]], [[ISO 10303|STEP AP 242]], or [[ANSI]] QIF&lt;ref&gt;[http://qifstandards.org "Quality Information Framework"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The core MBE tenet is that models are used to drive all aspects of the product lifecycle and that data is created once and reused by all downstream data consumers. Data reusability requires [[Machine-Readable Documents|computer interpretability]], where an MBD can be processed directly by downstream applications, and associativity of PMI to specific model features within the MBD.&lt;ref name=NIST1753 /&gt;

==History==

Historically, engineering and manufacturing activities have relied on hardcopy and/or digital documents (including 2D [[Engineering drawing|drawings]]) to convey engineering data and drive manufacturing processes. These documents required interpretation by skilled practitioners, often leading to ambiguities and errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Ambiguity in drawing| url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/microsites/sota/tracey/journal/ambi/images/Willats.pdf|author=John Willats|publisher=TRACEY the online journal of contemporary drawing research |accessdate=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tandler|first1=Bill|title=GD&amp;T Workshop: A Top Down View|url=http://www.qualitymag.com/articles/88676-gd-t-workshop-a-top-down-view|website=Quality Magazine|publisher=BNP Media|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, improvements in 3D [[solid modeling]] made it possible for CAD systems to precisely represent the shape of most manufactured goods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Weisberg, David|title=The Engineering Design Revolution|url=http://www.cadhistory.net/16%20Parametric%20Technology.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;—however, even enthusiastic adopters of solid modeling technology continued to rely upon 2D drawings (often CAD generated) as the authority (or master) product representation. 3D models, even if geometrically accurate, lacked a method to represent dimensions, tolerances, and other annotative information required to drive manufacturing processes.

In the early-to-middle 2000s, the [[ASME Y14.41-2003| ASME Y14.41-2003 Digital Product Data Definition Practices]] and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 16792:2006 Technical product documentation -- Digital product definition data practices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Technical product documentation -- Digital product definition data practices|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/31065.html|publisher=ISO TC 10 Technical product documentation |accessdate=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; standards were released, providing support for PMI annotations in 3D CAD models, and introducing the concept of MBD (or, alternatively, digital product definition)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Quality Assurance Standard For Digital Product Definition At Boeing Suppliers |url= http://www.boeingsuppliers.com/supplier/D6-51991.pdf|publisher=Boeing D6-51991|accessdate=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model-based enterprise concept first appeared about 2005. Initially it was construed broadly, referring to the pervasive use of modeling and simulation technologies (of almost any type) throughout an enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, Richard, [http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2005/systems/wednesday/neal.pdf "Next Generation Manufacturing Technology Initiative and the Model-Based Enterprise"], NDIA Systems Engineering Conference, San Diego, California October 26, 2005. Retrieved on 27 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 2000s, An active community advocating development of MBE grew, based on the collaborative efforts of the Office of the [[Secretary of Defense]], [[Army Research Laboratory]], [[ARDEC|Armament Research Development Engineering Center (ARDEC)]], [http://www.armymantech.com/ Army ManTech], [[BAE Systems]], [[NIST]], and the NIST Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leonarf|first1=Scott|title=Advanced Manufacturing Enterprise Strategic Baseline|url=https://www.dodmantech.com/JDMTP/Files/AME_Strategic_Baseline_03_Nov_11.pdf|website=DoD ManTech|publisher=US Department of Defense|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "MBE Team" included industry participants such as [[General Dynamics]], [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]] [[Rocketdyne]], Elysium, [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], EOS, ITI TranscenData, Vistagy, [[PTC (software company)|PTC]], [[Dassault Systemes]] Delmia, [[Boeing]], and [[BAE Systems]].&lt;ref name=osd&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whittenburg|first1=Mitzi|title=Model Based Enterprise and its Impact on Small Businesses|url=http://www.acq.osd.mil/osbp/councils/marc/resources/201103-model-based-enterprise.pdf|website=osd.mil|publisher=Office of the Secretary of Defense|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, based on community feedback, MBE became more narrowly construed, referring to the use of MBD data to drive product lifecycle activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frechette|first1=S|title=Model Based Enterprise for Manufacturing|url=http://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=908343|website=NIST|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NIST1753 /&gt; In 2011, the MBE Team published these definitions:

* MBD: A 3D annotated model and its associated data elements that fully define the product definition in a manner that can be used effectively by all downstream customers in place of a traditional drawing.
* MBE: A fully integrated and collaborative environment founded on 3D product definition detail and shared across the enterprise; to enable rapid, seamless, and affordable deployment of products from concept to disposal&lt;ref name=osd /&gt;

By 2015, with improvements to ASME Y14.41 and ISO 16792, and the development of open [[CAD data exchange]] standards capable of adequately representing PMI, MBE started to become more widely adopted by manufacturers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9133">In mathematics, '''Moufang polygons'''  are a generalization by [[Jacques Tits]] of the [[Moufang plane]]s studied by [[Ruth Moufang]], and are irreducible [[building (mathematics)|building]]s of rank two that admit the action of [[root group]]s.
In a book on the topic, Tits and Richard Weiss&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jacques |last1=Tits |authorlink1=Jacques Tits|first2=Richard |last2=Weiss |title=Moufang Polygons |location= |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2002 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; classify them all. An earlier theorem, proved independently by Tits and Weiss,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Jacques |last1=Tits |authorlink1=Jacques Tits |title=Non-existence de certains, polygones généralisés, I, II |journal=[[Inventiones Mathematicae]] |volume=36 |issue=1 |year=1976 |pages=275–284 |doi=10.1007/BF01390013 }} '''51''' (3), (1979) 267–269 {{doi|10.1007/BF01389919}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Richard |last=Weiss |title=The nonexistence of certain Moufang polygons |journal=Inventiones Mathematicae |volume=51 |issue=3 |year=1979 |pages=261–266 |doi=10.1007/BF01389918 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that a Moufang polygon must be a generalized 3-gon, 4-gon, 6-gon, or 8-gon, so the purpose of the aforementioned book was to analyze these four cases.

==Definitions==

*A generalized ''n''-gon is a bipartite graph of diameter ''n'' and girth 2''n''.
*A graph is called thick if all vertices have valence at least 3.
*A root of a generalized ''n''-gon is a path of length ''n''.
*An apartment of a generalized ''n''-gon is a cycle of length 2''n''.
*The root subgroup of a root is the subgroup of automorphisms of a graph that fix all vertices adjacent to one of the inner vertices of the root.
*A Moufang ''n''-gon is a thick generalized ''n''-gon (with ''n''&gt;2) such that the root subgroup of any root acts transitively on the apartments containing the root.

== Moufang 3-gons ==
A Moufang 3-gon can be identified with the [[incidence graph]] of a Moufang [[projective plane]]. In this identification, the points and lines of the plane correspond to the vertices of the building.
Real forms of [[Lie groups]] give rise to examples which are the three main types of Moufang 3-gons. There are four real [[division algebras]]: the real numbers, the [[complex numbers]], the [[quaternions]], and the [[octonions]], of dimensions 1,2,4 and 8, respectively. The projective plane over such a division algebra then gives rise to a Moufang 3-gon.

These projective planes correspond to the building attached to SL&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;('''R'''), SL&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;('''C'''), a real form of A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and to a real form of E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.

In the first diagram{{clarify|post-text=what diagram?|date=August 2012}} the circled nodes represent 1-spaces and 2-spaces in a three-dimensional vector space. In the second diagram{{clarify|post-text=what diagram?|date=August 2012}} the circled nodes represent 1-space and 2-spaces in a 3-dimensional vector space over the [[quaternions]], which in turn represent certain 2-spaces and 4-spaces in a 6-dimensional complex vector space, as expressed by the circled nodes in the A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; diagram. 
The fourth case — a form of E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; — is exceptional, and its analogue for Moufang 4-gons is a major feature of Weiss’s book.

Going from the real numbers to an arbitrary field, Moufang 3-gons can be divided into three cases as above. The split case in the first diagram exists over any field. The second case extends to all associative, non-commutative division algebras; over the reals these are limited to the algebra of quaternions, which has degree 2 (and dimension 4), but some fields admit central division algebras of other degrees. 
The third case involves ‘alternative’ division algebras (which satisfy a weakened form of the associative law), and a theorem of [[Richard Bruck]] and Erwin Kleinfeld&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Richard H. |last=Bruck |author1-link=Richard Bruck|first2=Erwin |last2=Kleinfeld |title=The structure of alternative division rings |journal=[[Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=2 |issue=6 |year=1951 |pages=878–890 |doi= 10.2307/2031702 |jstor=2031702|mr=0045099 |pmc=1063309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that these are Cayley-Dickson algebras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Erwin |last=Kleinfeld |title=Alternative division rings of characteristic 2 |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume=37 |issue=12 |year=1951 |pages=818–820 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.37.12.818|pmc=1063478|mr=0041834 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concludes the discussion of Moufang 3-gons.

== Moufang 4-gons ==
Moufang 4-gons are also called Moufang quadrangles.
The classification of Moufang 4-gons was the hardest of all, and when Tits and Weiss started to write it up, a hitherto unnoticed type came into being, arising from groups of type F4. They can be divided into three classes:

*  (i) Those arising from classical groups.
* (ii) Those arising from “mixed groups” (in which there are two imperfect fields of characteristic 2, K and L, with K2 ⊂ L ⊂ K).
* (iii) Those arising from quadrangular algebras.

There is some overlap here, in the sense that some classical groups arising from pseudo-quadratic spaces can be obtained from quadrangular algebras (which Weiss calls special), but there are other, non-special ones. The most important of these arise from algebraic groups of types E6, E7, and E8. They are k-forms of algebraic groups belonging to the following diagrams:
E6
E7
E8. 
The E6 one exists over the real numbers, though the E7 and E8 ones do not. Weiss calls the quadrangular algebras in all these cases Weiss regular, but not special. 
There is a further type that he calls defective arising from groups of type F4. These are the most exotic of all—they involve purely inseparable field extensions in characteristic 2—and Weiss only discovered them during the joint work with Tits on the classification of Moufang 4-gons by investigating a strange lacuna that should not have existed but did.

The classification of Moufang 4-gons by Tits and Weiss is related to their intriguing monograph in two ways. One is that the use of quadrangular algebras short-cuts some of the methods known before. The other is that the concept is an analogue to the octonion algebras, and quadratic Jordan division algebras of degree 3, that give rise to Moufang 3-gons and 6-gons.

In fact all the exceptional Moufang planes, quadrangles, and hexagons that do not arise from "mixed groups" (of characteristic 2 for quadrangles or characteristic 3 for hexagons) come from octonions, quadrangular algebras, or Jordan algebras.

== Moufang 6-gons ==
Moufang 6-gons are also called Moufang hexagons. A classification of Moufang 6-gons was stated by Tits,&lt;ref&gt;J. Tits, Classification of buildings of spherical type and Moufang polygons: a survey, in
Coll. Internaz. Teorie Combinatorie, Atti dei Convegni Lincei 17, Rome 1976, pp. 229–246.&lt;/ref&gt; though the details remained unproven until the joint work with Weiss on Moufang Polygons.

== Moufang 8-gons ==
Moufang 8-gons are also called Moufang octagons. They were classified by Tits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Tits |title=Moufang octagons and Ree groups of type &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; |journal=[[American Journal of Mathematics|Amer. J. Math.]] |volume=105 |issue=2 |year=1983 |pages=539–594 |jstor=2374268 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he showed that they all arise from [[Ree groups]] of type ²F₄.

==Quadrangular algebras==
A potential use for quadrangular algebras is to analyze two open questions. One is the Kneser-Tits conjecture&lt;ref&gt;J. Tits, Groupes de Whitehead de groupes algébriques simples sur un corps, Séminaire Bourbaki, 1976–77, no. 505; Lecture Notes in Mathematics 677, Springer-Verlag, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; that concerns the full group of '''linear transformations''' of a building (e.g. GL&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) factored out by the subgroup generated by root groups (e.g. SL&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).

The conjecture is proved for all Moufang buildings except the 6-gons and 4-gons of type E8, in which case the group of linear transformations is conjectured to be equal to the subgroup generated by root groups. For the E8 hexagons this can be rephrased as a question on quadratic Jordan algebras, and for the E8 quadrangles it can now be rephrased in terms of quadrangular algebras.

Another open question about the E8 quadrangle concerns fields that are complete with respect to a discrete valuation: is there, in such cases, an affine building that yields the quadrangle as its structure at infinity?

A '''mount of piety''' is an institutional [[pawnbroker]] run as a [[charitable organization|charity]] in [[Europe]] from [[Renaissance]] times until today, more often referred to by the relevant local term, such as '''monte di pietà''' (Italian),  '''mont de piété''' (French) or '''monte de piedad''' (Spanish). Similar institutions were established in the colonies of Catholic countries; the Mexican [[Nacional Monte de Piedad]] is still in operation.

==History==
[[File:Regola - monte di pietà 1230478.JPG|thumb|Monte di Pietà building in Rome, ''[[rioni of Rome|rione]]'' [[Regola (rione of Rome)|Regola]]]]
This fifteenth-century institution originated in [[Italy]]; [[Barnabas of Terni]] is credited as the originator of the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02301a.htm|title=Barnabas of Terni|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed in cities as an early form of organized [[Charity (practice)|charity]], and was intended as a reform against [[money lending]].&lt;ref name="George 351"&gt;George 351.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The public office was organized and operated by the [[Catholic Church]] and offered financial [[loan]]s at a moderate [[interest]] to those in need.&lt;ref&gt;Pullan 446.&lt;/ref&gt;  The organizing principle, based on the benefit of the borrower and not the [[Profit (economics)|profit]] of the lender, was viewed as a benevolent alternative to the loans provided by moneylenders.&lt;ref name="George 351"/&gt; The organization of the Monte di Pietà depended on acquiring a monte, a collection of funds from voluntary donations by financially privileged people who had no intentions of regaining their money. The people in need would then be able to come to the Monte di Pietà and give an item of value in exchange for a monetary loan. The term of the loan would last the course of a year and would only be worth about two-thirds of the borrower’s item value. A pre-determined interest rate would be applied to the loan and these profits were used to pay the expenses of operating the Monte di Pietà.&lt;ref&gt;Menning, ''Loans and Favors, Kin and Clients: Cosimo de’ Medici and the Monte di Pieta'' 491.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over succeeding centuries such organizations spread throughout the continent of Western Europe,&lt;ref&gt;George 351&lt;/ref&gt; a credit to the preaching of [[Franciscan]]s and their condemnation of [[usury]],&lt;ref&gt;Toaff xii.&lt;/ref&gt; with later support by both [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] preachers and [[Renaissance Humanism|humanist]] intellectuals of the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Menning, ''The Monte’s ‘Monte’: The Early Supporters of Florence’s Monte di Pieta'' 662.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
[[File:Monte di Pietà della Citta di Firenze 1719.jpg|thumb|Obligation of the Monte di Pietà della Citta di Firenze, issued 21. October 1719]]
{{see also|Palazzo del Monte di Pietà (Messina)|Palazzo of Monte di Pietà, Naples|Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena}}
In 1462, the first recorded [[Monte di Pietà di Perugia|Monte di Pietà]] was founded in [[Perugia]].  Between 1462 and 1470, an estimated forty more were developed.&lt;ref&gt;Toaff 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Franciscan [[Marco di Matteo Strozzi]] preached about the benefits of a Monte di Pietà in combating usury.  He left a set of memoirs that outlined his goal to rid the city of Jewish money lenders and to replace them with Christian pawn shops which allowed the poor to acquire cheap credit.&lt;ref&gt;Menning, ''Loans and Favors, Kin and Clients: Cosimo de’ Medici and the Monte di Pietà 487.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Rome, Pope [[Sixtus V]] (1585-90) founded in 1585 the local Monte di Pietà in [[via dei Coronari]]. Moved later near [[Campo de' Fiori]] to the piazza bearing its name, it still exists.&lt;ref name=pie14&gt;Carlo Pietrangeli Guide rionali di Roma, Ponte, II (1981) p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

===England===
The first institution was started in 1361 by the [[Bishop of London]], [[Michael Northburgh]], who left 1,000 marks of silver for the establishment of a bank that should lend money on pawned objects, without interest, providing that the expenses of the institution be defrayed from its foundation capital. He had the monies deposited in a chest in the body of St Paul's and directed that if in any case at the end of the year the sums borrowed were not repaid, then the preacher at Paul's Cross should in his sermon declare that the pledge would be sold within fourteen days, if not redeemed forthwith.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Knight's London, 1851, Vol. 1. p.38.&lt;/ref&gt; The capital was eventually consumed, and the bank closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Montes Pietatis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malta===
{{main|Monte di Pietà (Malta)}}
Malta's Monte di Pietà was set up in 1598, initially under the name Monte di Sant'Anna. It was merged with the [[Monte della Redenzione degli Schiavi]] in 1787, becoming known as the Monte di Pietà e Redenzione. The Monte di Pietà is still in operation today as part of the Inland Revenue Department.&lt;ref name="melitensiawth"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Denaro|first1=Victor F.|title=Houses in Merchants Street, Valletta|journal=Melita Historica|date=1958|volume=2|issue=3|pages=161–164|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.02(1956-59)/MH.2(1958)3/orig04.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304124519/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.02(1956-59)/MH.2(1958)3/orig04.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
The Brussels Mont de Piété, first founded in 1618, is still an active institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montdepiete.be/|title=Mont-de-Piété // Accueil|author=|date=|website=www.montdepiete.be|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founder was [[Wenceslas Cobergher]], who went on to establish fifteen such institutions in different towns in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] in the years between 1618 and 1633, financed by the provision of annuities in return for direct capital investment.&lt;ref&gt;P. Soetaert, ''De Bergen van Barmhartigheid in de Spaanse, de Oostenrijkse en de Franse Nederlanden, 1618-1795'' (Dissertatie Leuven, Historische Uitgaven LXVII; Brussels, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this date the provision of consumer credit was largely in the hands of [[Lombard banking|Lombards]] whose loans were at high rates of interest. Criticism of the Monts de Piété as themselves usurious institutions that both borrowed and lent at interest were countered by the [[Jesuit]] [[Catholic moral theology|moral theologian]] [[Leonardus Lessius]] in an appendix to the 1621 edition of his ''De justitia et jure''.&lt;ref&gt;Toon Van Houdt (ed.), ''Tussen woeker en weldadigheid: Leonardus Lessius over de Bergen van Barmhartigheid, 1621'' (Leuven, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
===Employees===
A ''massaro'' or ''massaio'' had the duty of overseeing the daily interactions between the borrowers that came to the Monte di Pietà and the other employees.  If the item was believed to be the legal property of the borrower two assistants called ''scrivani'' collected the pawn from the borrower.  After examining and recording details about the condition of the object, it would then be passed to assessors who would evaluate the item’s value.  The massaro would then make three copies of a numbered receipt that identified the owner’s name, the type of object being pawned, the condition of the object, the object’s value, the amount of the loan and the date.&lt;ref&gt;Menning, ''Charity and state in late Renaissance Italy: the monte di pieta of Florence'' 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, the loan would not exceed two thirds of the object’s value.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}  Of the three receipts, one would be given to the owner-borrower, another would be kept in the massaro’s record book and one would be attached to the item.

The monetary funds would then be supplied by the cashier to the borrower.  This employee had the duty of keeping their own records of the money collected, loaned and the interest on each loan.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}  During the first year of operations, the Monte di Pietà did not grant loans more than twenty-five lire to people who lived in the city and ten lire to people who lived in the rural area five miles from the city.  This restriction was expected to increase as more funds were acquired from voluntary and involuntary donations.  If a borrower wanted to regain his pawned item, he would have to return the receipt to the massaro.  The cashier would then calculate the interest that was earned on the item and the borrower would have to pay the interest in order to redeem their pawn.  This interest collection provided one of the sources of revenue for the daily functions, operations, and salaries of the Monte di Pietà.&lt;ref&gt;Menning, ''Charity and state in late Renaissance Italy: the monte di pieta of Florence'' 60.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Monte di Pietà‘s employees were responsible for keeping track of the daily operations of the organization.  Strict regulation dictated both their work and personal life.  For example, fines were imposed for improper or dishonest behaviour.  The actual space of the "Monte di Pietà was regarded as a pious and religious house" and therefore stage plays, dances, games and other festivities were forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;Menning, ''Charity and state in late Renaissance Italy: the monte di pieta of Florence'' 61.&lt;/ref&gt;
The employees’ salaries came from the income generated by the interest payments on loans.  The massaro earned 120 florins per year, the cashier was paid 80 florins, the massaro’s two assistants received 30 florins each, the assessors received 40 florins each, and the two servants earned 24 florins each.&lt;ref&gt;Menning, ''Charity and state in late Renaissance Italy: the monte di pieta of Florence'' 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Borrowers and lenders===
The Monte di Pietà accumulated capital from members of the patrician class,&lt;ref&gt;Menning, ''The Monte’s ‘Monte’: The Early Supporters of Florence’s Monte di Pieta'' 675-6.&lt;/ref&gt; middle class,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Menning, ''Loans and Favors, Kin and Clients: Cosimo de’ Medici and the Monte di Pieta'' 510.&lt;/ref&gt; corporate groups, guilds,&lt;ref&gt;Menning, ''The Monte’s ‘Monte’: The Early Supporters of Florence’s Monte di Pieta'' 674.&lt;/ref&gt; fines resulting from lawsuits and Communed ordered resources.&lt;ref&gt;Menning, ''The Monte’s ‘Monte’: The Early Supporters of Florence’s Monte di Pieta'' 661&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most creative strategies that preachers used in Florentine to acquire more capital for their “monte” was to declare Palm Sunday as a day for donations in the form of alms.&lt;ref&gt;Menning, ''The Monte’s ‘Monte’: The Early Supporters of Florence’s Monte di Pieta'' 669.&lt;/ref&gt;  The “monte” was supposed to be gathered from "gifts or donations in honour of a person’s love for God".&lt;ref&gt;Menning, ''The Monte’s ‘Monte’: The Early Supporters of Florence’s Monte di Pieta'' 667.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars hypothesize that members of the artisan class and widows would freely give some money towards the “monte” upon hearing a sermon condemning usury and proclaiming the need to help the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Menning, ''The Monte’s ‘Monte’: The Early Supporters of Florence’s Monte di Pieta'' 699.&lt;/ref&gt;
While some monetary deposits were voluntary, some people had no choice in funding the capital for the “monte”.  For example, Monna Margherita da Poppi of 1497 gave 40 lire to the Monte di Pietà as part of her sentence in a legal matter.  The Monte di Pietà was in charge of keeping this money from her until she was married.  In this case, the organization of the Monte di Pietà was a dowry fund which became popular during the mid-sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Menning, ''The Monte’s ‘Monte’: The Early Supporters of Florence’s Monte di Pieta'' 671.&lt;/ref&gt;  More revenues for the “monte” were acquired from the state through ordered fines.&lt;ref&gt;Menning, ''The Monte’s ‘Monte’: The Early Supporters of Florence’s Monte di Pieta'' 673.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules and regulations==
Before the Monte di Pietà actually operated, a group of "eight men assembled to draw up the statues" of the Florentine monte di pietà on April 15, 1496.  The eight who gathered were Niccolò de’ Nobili, Piero de’ Lenzi, Bernardo de’ Segni, Niccolò de’ Nero, Piero de’ Guicciardini, Giacopo de’ Salviati, Antonio di Sasso di Sasso and Diacopo Mannucci.&lt;ref&gt;Menning, ''Charity and state in late Renaissance Italy: the monte di pieta of Florence'' 46&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the members of the patrician class that dominated the prestigious and well paid positions of decision making concerning the Monte di Pietà.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}
Since the purpose of the Monte di Pietà was to combat usury, there were clear guidelines regarding the operations of the organization.  For example, the employees had to ensure that all items that were exchanged were free, and therefore the legal property of the person pawning it.  Also there were guidelines regarding the kind of items that were permitted, and the amount a person could borrow, both in terms of time and quantity.  For example, holy items and unfinished goods such as pieces of cloth were not accepted as pawns for loans.&lt;ref&gt;Menning, ''Charity and state in late Renaissance Italy: the monte di pieta of Florence'' 48-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on society==
The Monte di pietà was developed on the principle of charity.  It was designed to aid less fortunate people by providing an alternative to the socially unaccepted [[Loans and interest in Judaism|Jewish money lending system]].&lt;ref&gt;Menning, ''Charity and state in late Renaissance Italy: the monte di pieta of Florence'' 87.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Jewish banks continued to exist with the Monte di Pietà and they each catered to a distinctive clientele.&lt;ref&gt;Toaff vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference from ''montepío''==
The Mount of Piety is a different organisational form from the so-called ''montepío'', which appeared during the second half of the 18th century. The Montepío was a [[Mutual organization|mutual]], [[agnostic]], and government-controlled institution established by craftsmen or lesser standing professionals to care for members' needs when disabled or rehabilitating. They operated under a [[Patron Saint]] and in a church or monastery but without any religious obligation (and many had an ephemeral life).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5157">In [[mathematics]], an '''open book decomposition''' (or simply an '''open book''') is a [[manifold decomposition|decomposition]] of a [[closed manifold|closed]] [[oriented]] [[3-manifold]] ''M'' into a union of [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s (necessarily with boundary) and [[solid torus|solid tori]]. Open books have relevance to [[contact geometry]], with a famous theorem of [[Emmanuel Giroux]] (given below) that shows that contact geometry can be studied from an entirely topological viewpoint.

==Definition and construction==
'''Definition.'''  An ''open book decomposition'' of a 3-dimensional manifold ''M'' is a pair (''B'', π) where
:*''B'' is an oriented [[link (knot theory)|link]] in ''M'', called the '''binding''' of the open book;
:*&amp;pi;: ''M''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''B''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[fibration]] of the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of ''B'' such that for each &amp;theta;&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;pi;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(&amp;theta;) is the interior of a compact surface &amp;Sigma;&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;''M'' whose boundary is ''B''. The surface &amp;Sigma; is called the '''page''' of the open book.
This is the special case ''m'' = 3 of an open book decomposition of an ''m''-dimensional manifold, for any ''m''.

When Σ is an oriented compact surface with ''n'' boundary components and φ:&amp;nbsp;Σ&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;Σ is a [[homeomorphism]] which is the identity near the boundary, we can construct an open book by first forming the [[mapping torus]] Σ&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;. Since φ is the identity on ∂Σ, ∂Σ&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt; is the trivial circle bundle over a union of circles, that is, a union of tori; one torus for each boundary component. To complete the construction, [[solid torus|solid tori]] are glued to fill in the boundary tori so that each circle ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;{''p''}&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;∂''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is identified with the boundary of a page. In this case, the binding is the collection of ''n'' cores ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;{q} of the ''n'' solid tori glued into the mapping torus, for arbitrarily chosen ''q''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It is known that any open book can be constructed this way. As the only information used in the construction is the surface and the homeomorphism, an alternate definition of open book is simply the pair (Σ,&amp;nbsp;φ) with the construction understood. In short, an open book is a mapping torus with solid tori glued in so that the core circle of each torus runs parallel to the boundary of the fiber.

Each torus in ∂Σ&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt; is fibered by circles parallel to the binding, each circle a boundary component of a page. One envisions a [[rolodex]]-looking structure for a neighborhood of the binding (that is, the solid torus glued to ∂Σ&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;mdash;the pages of the rolodex connect to pages of the open book and the center of the rolodex is the binding. Thus the term ''open book''.

It is a 1972 theorem of Elmar Winkelnkemper that for ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;6, a simply-connected ''m''-dimensional manifold has an open book decomposition if and only if it has signature&amp;nbsp;0. In 1977 Terry Lawson proved that for odd ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;6, every ''m''-dimensional manifold has an open book decomposition. For even ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;6,  an ''m''-dimensional manifold has an open book decomposition if and only if an asymmetric [[Witt group]] obstruction is 0, by a 1979 theorem of [[Frank Quinn (mathematician)|Frank Quinn]].

==Giroux correspondence==

In 2002, Emmanuel Giroux published the following result:

'''Theorem.''' Let ''M'' be a compact oriented 3-manifold. Then there is a [[bijection]] between the set of oriented [[contact structure]]s on ''M'' [[up to]] [[Ambient isotopy|isotopy]] and the set of open book decompositions of ''M'' up to positive stabilization.

''Positive stabilization'' consists of modifying the page by adding a [[handle decomposition|2-dimensional 1-handle]] and modifying the monodromy by adding a positive [[Dehn twist]] along a curve that runs over that handle exactly once. Implicit in this theorem is that the new open book defines the same contact 3-manifold. Giroux's result has led to some breakthroughs in what is becoming more commonly called [[contact topology]], such as the classification of contact structures on certain classes of 3-manifolds. Roughly speaking, a contact structure corresponds to an open book if, away from the binding, the contact distribution is isotopic to the tangent spaces of the pages through [[confoliation]]s. One imagines smoothing the contact planes (preserving the contact condition almost everywhere) to lie tangent to the pages.

[[File:Gerhard von Kügelgen 001.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Friedrich Schiller]] by [[Gerhard von Kügelgen]]]]

[[Friedrich Schiller]] developed the concept of the '''play drive''', a conjoining through contradiction of [[human being|man]]'s experience of the infinite and finite, freedom and time, sense and reason, life and form.  The object of the play drive is the living form, and in contemplation of the beautiful it allows man to become most human. To understand how he comes to this conclusion, it is important to trace the origins of life and form, as a function of the two drives that the play drive mediates: the form drive and the sense drive. These two drives are themselves functions of man's person and condition, which Schiller initially describes in terms of the absolute and time.

==Schiller's view of the human condition==

===Person===
In [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s thought, the sense and the form drive arise out of man's existence as a "person", which endures, and man's "condition", the determining attributes that change. The person is described as unchangeable and eternal, and endures change. "We pass from rest to activity, from passion to indifference, from agreement to contradiction; but we remain, and what proceeds directly from us remains too".&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, p.115&lt;/ref&gt; This personhood is grounded in itself, and not in the contradictory state of condition. Schiller argues that because man is finite, condition and person have to be separate, and cannot be grounded in each other. If they were, either change would persist or the person would change. "And so we would, in the first place, have the idea of absolute being grounded upon itself, that is to say freedom".&lt;ref name=Schiller116&gt;Schiller, p.116&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, person is grounded in itself, and this grounding is responsible for man's idea of freedom. Freedom, defined as an absolute being grounded in itself.

===Condition===
Unlike the person, condition, according to Schiller, cannot be grounded in itself. It is already established that condition cannot be grounded in person, and must therefore proceed from something else. This "proceeding" grounds the condition in contingency, which is man's experience of time. "For man is not just a person situated in a particular condition. Every condition, however, every determinate existence, has its origins in time; and so man, as a phenomenal being, must also have a beginning, although the pure intelligence within him is eternal".&lt;ref name=Schiller116/&gt; Man receives reality that is outside of him, as something changing within time. This changing perception is accompanied by the eternal "I" – the person – which organizes the change and variety into a unity. "The reality which the supreme intelligence creates out of itself, man has first to receive, and he does in fact receive it, by way of perception, as something existing outside of him in space, and as something changing within him in time".&lt;ref name="Schiller, p.117"&gt;Schiller, p.117&lt;/ref&gt; The perfect man, according to Schiller, would be a constant unity amongst constant change. These seemingly contradictory forces of freedom through person and time through condition, manifest themselves in man as the form and the sense drive. These drives, and consequently man's experience of freedom and time, are mediated by the play drive.

===Sense and Form Drives===

====Sense Drive====
The sense drive, in Schiller's thought, is a function of man's condition. It comes from man's physical existence, and the whole of man's phenomenal existence stems from it. In his sensuous existence man is set within the limits of time, within his condition, and becomes matter. "By matter in this context we understand nothing more than change, or reality that occupies time. Consequently this drive demands that there shall be change, that time shall have content".&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, p.118&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, sensation of the sensuous drive is time occupied by content.

====Form Drive====
The form drive, in Schiller's view, is a function of the person grounded in itself. This drive is man's rational nature, his "absolute existence", and its goal is to give man freedom, so he could bring harmony to the variety of things in the world. Because the form drive insists on the absolute, "It wants the real to be necessary and eternal, and the eternal and necessary to be real. In other words, it insist on truth and on the right".&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, p.119&lt;/ref&gt; The sense drive and the form drive are in competition, and overpower one another in the person.

====In competition====
If the sense drive overcomes the form drive, according to Schiller, it reduces man into matter, but leaves him without the ability to bring this matter into unity. "As long as he merely feels, merely desires and acts upon desire, he is as yet nothing but world, if by this term we understand nothing but the formless content of time" (117). In order to not be just "world", man must exercise his form drive upon matter, and "give reality the predisposition he carries within him".&lt;ref name="Schiller, p.117"/&gt; When the form drive overpowers, Schiller says we experience "the greatest enlargement of being",&lt;ref name=Schiller121&gt;Schiller, p.121&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that because it is a drive toward the absolute, all limitations disappear, and instead of seeing the world finitely, as he does through the sensuous drive, "man has raised himself to a unity of ideas embracing the whole realm of phenomena".&lt;ref name=Schiller121/&gt; Since the sense drive places us in time, indulging in the formal drive removes us out of time, and in doing so "We are no longer individuals; we are species".&lt;ref name=Schiller121/&gt; While this seems like a perfected state, it is only a point on the path to man reaching his maximum potential.

====In equilibrium====
To maximize potential of the two drives, Schiller argues, one cannot suffocate or limit the other. The perfection of the sense drive would consist in maximizing changeability and maximizing extensity. This is the development of receptivity, through which man presents more "surface" to phenomena of the world. "The more facets his receptivity develops, the more labile it is, and the more surface it presents to phenomena, so much more world does man apprehend, and all the more potentialities does he develop in himself".&lt;ref name=Schiller122&gt;Schiller, p.122&lt;/ref&gt; To suppress this faculty would not achieve the perfection of the form drive, rather the opposite. The perfection of the form drive is accomplished in its ability to oppose the sense drive through its endurance to change. "The more power and depth the personality achieves, and the more freedom reason attains, so much more world does man comprehend, and all the more form does he create outside of himself".&lt;ref name=Schiller122/&gt; Therefore, the Form drive's autonomy and intensity are maximized as a response to the maximization of the sense drive. "Where both these aptitudes are conjoined, man will combine the greatest fullness of existence with the highest autonomy and freedom and instead of losing himself to the world, will rather draw the latter into himself in all its infinitude of phenomena, and subject it to the unity of his reason"&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, p.123&lt;/ref&gt;  This "conjoining" of the two faculties, are actually a mediation by the third fundamental drive, the play drive.

===Play Drive===
The play drive mediates the demands of the sense and the form drive. "The sense drive demands that there shall be change and that time shall have a content; the form drive demands that time shall be annulled and that there shall be no change. That drive, therefore, in which both others work in concert is the play drive, reconciling becoming with absolute being and change with identity".&lt;ref name=Schiller126&gt;Schiller, p.126&lt;/ref&gt; For the play drive to successfully mediate the two drives, man must be educated of two things. He must learn passivity, to exercise his sense drive and become receptive of the world. He must learn activity, to free his reason, as much as possible from the receptive. Accomplishing both, man is able to have a twofold experience simultaneously, "in which he were to be at once conscious of his freedom and sensible of his existence, were at one and the same time, to feel himself matter and come to know himself as mind".&lt;ref name=Schiller126&gt;Schiller, p.126&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, by maximizing the constraint of the absolute and the contingency of the material, the play drive negates the demands of both drives and sets man free both physically and morally. To exist in this paradoxical state, would mean to have a  "complete intuition of his human nature".&lt;ref name=Schiller126/&gt; Furthermore, "the object that afforded him this vision would become for him the symbol of his accomplished destiny"&lt;ref name=Schiller126/&gt; and this would serve him as a finite embodiment of the infinite. Schiller names this object of the play drive 'living form'.

===Living Form===
The living form comes from a mediation of the "objects" of the sense and the form drives. The object of the sense drive, Schiller calls life. This concept designates all material being and all that is immediately present to the senses. It is a function of man's condition. The object of the form drive, he simply calls form. This concept includes all the formal qualities of things and their relationship to our reason. Schiller argues for the necessity of the interplay of the two objects in creation of a [[sculpture]] from a block of [[marble]]. "As long as we merely think about his form, it is lifeless, a mere abstraction; as long as we merely feel his life, it is formless, a mere expression. Only when his form lives in our feeling and his life takes on form in our understanding, does he become a living form".&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, p.128&lt;/ref&gt; This experience of the living form, as a mediation of life and form by the play drive, is what Schiller calls the experience of beauty. "Beauty results from the reciprocal action of two opposed drives and from the uniting of two opposed principles. The highest ideal of beauty, therefore, to be sought in the most perfect possible union and equilibrium of reality and form".&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, p.132&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in contemplation of the beautiful, man is exercising the play drive, and is fully human.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4618">In [[artificial intelligence]], '''preference-based planning''' is a form of [[automated planning and scheduling]] which focuses on producing plans that additionally satisfy as many user-specified [[preference]]s as possible. In many [[problem domain]]s, a task can be accomplished by various sequences of actions (also known as plans). These plans can vary in quality: there can be many ways to solve a problem but one generally prefers a way that is, e.g., cost-effective, quick and safe.

Preference-based planners take these preferences into account when producing a plan for a given problem. Examples of preference-based planning software include ''PPLAN''&lt;ref name="pplan"&gt;[http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sheila/PPLAN/ PPLAN], Bienvenu et al.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''HTNPlan-P''&lt;ref name="htnplanp"&gt;[http://www.cs.toronto.edu/kr/publications/1242050782_Sohrabi-IJCAI09.pdf HTN Planning with Preferences], Sohrabi et al.&lt;/ref&gt; (preference-based [[Hierarchical task network|HTN planning]]).

== Overview ==

Preferences can be regarded as soft constraints on a plan. The quality of a plan increases when more preferences are satisfied but it may not be possible to satisfy all preferences in a single plan. This differs from hard constraints which must be satisfied in all plans produced by the planning software. These hard constraints are part of the domain knowledge while the soft constraints (or preferences) are separately specified by the user. This allows the same domain knowledge to be reused for various users who may have different preferences.

The use of preferences may also increase the length of a plan in order to satisfy more preferences. For example, when planning a journey from home to school, the user may prefer to buy a cup of coffee along the way. The planning software could now plan to visit [[Starbucks]] first and then continue to school.&lt;ref name="starbucks"&gt;[http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~tson/papers/tplp-plan-prefs.pdf Planning with Preferences using Logic Programming], Son and Pontelli&lt;/ref&gt; This increases the length of the plan but the user's preference is satisfied.

The [[Planning Domain Definition Language]] (as of version 3.0&lt;ref name="pddl3"&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2008.10.012 Deterministic planning in the fifth international planning competition: PDDL3 and experimental evaluation of the planners], Gerevini et al.&lt;/ref&gt;) supports the specification of preferences through &lt;code&gt;preference&lt;/code&gt; statements. For example, the statement

:&lt;code&gt;(preference (always (clean room1)))&lt;/code&gt;

indicates that the user prefers that &lt;code&gt;room1&lt;/code&gt; should be clean at each state of the plan. In other words, the planner should not schedule an action that causes &lt;code&gt;room1&lt;/code&gt; to become dirty. As this example shows, a preference is evaluated with regard to all states of a plan (if [[Semantics|semantically]] required).

In addition to &lt;code&gt;always&lt;/code&gt;, other constructs based on [[linear temporal logic]] are also supported, such as &lt;code&gt;sometime&lt;/code&gt; (at least once during the plan), &lt;code&gt;sometime-after&lt;/code&gt; (to be planned after a particular state) and &lt;code&gt;at-most-once&lt;/code&gt; (the preference holds during at most one sequence of states in the plan).

=== Plan quality ===

In addition to determining whether a preference is satisfied, we also need to compute the quality of a plan based on how many preferences are satisfied. For this purpose, PDDL 3.0 includes an expression called &lt;code&gt;is-violated &lt;name&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which is equal to "the number of distinct preferences with the given name that are not satisfied in the plan".&lt;ref name="pddl3"/&gt; For a plan, a value can now be computed using a metric function, which is specified with &lt;code&gt;:metric&lt;/code&gt;:

:&lt;code&gt;(:metric minimize (+ (* 5 (is-violated pref1)) (* 7 (is-violated pref2))))&lt;/code&gt;

This example metric function specifies that the calculated value of the plan should be minimized (i.e., a plan with value ''v1'' and a plan with value ''v2'' such that ''v1'' &lt; ''v2'', the former plan is strictly preferred). The value of a plan is computed by the given function, which is expressed in [[Polish notation]]. In this case, violation of the second preference has been given a greater penalty than the first preference.

== Constraints satisfaction problem ==

In the area of [[constraint satisfaction problem]]s, flexible variants exist that deal with soft constraints in a similar way to preferences in preference-based planning.

{{Short description|Cognitive process of decoding symbols to derive meaning}}

{{Reading}}

'''Reading''' is the complex [[cognitive process]] of decoding [[symbols]] to derive meaning. 

Success in this process is measured as ''[[reading comprehension]]''. Reading is a means for [[language acquisition]], communication, and sharing [[information]] and ideas. The symbols are typically visual ([[written]] or [[printing|printed]]) but may be tactile ([[Braille]]). Like all languages, it is a complex interaction between text and reader, shaped by prior knowledge, experiences, attitude, and the language community—which is culturally and socially situated. The reading process requires continuous practice, development, and refinement. Reading requires creativity and critical analysis. Consumers of literature deviate from literal words to create images that make sense to them in the unfamiliar places the texts describe. Because reading is a complex process, it cannot be controlled or restricted to one or two interpretations. There are no concrete laws in reading, but rather it provides readers an escape to produce their own products introspectively. This promotes deep exploration of texts during interpretation.&lt;ref name="Certeau, Michel 1984"&gt;De Certeau, Michel. "Reading as Poaching." ''The Practice of Everyday Life''. Trans. Steven F. Rendall. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. 165-176.&lt;/ref&gt;
Readers use a variety of reading strategies to decode (to translate symbols into sounds or visual representations of [[speech]]) and comprehension. Readers may use context clues to identify the meaning of unknown words. Readers integrate the words they have read into their existing framework of knowledge or [[Schema (psychology)|schema]].

Other types of reading are not speech based [[writing system]]s, such as music [[Musical notation|notation]] or [[pictograms]]. The common link is the interpretation of [[symbols]] to extract the meaning from the visual notations or tactile signals (as in the case of [[Braille]]).

==Overview==
[[File:03282012Casa hogar niñas tlahuac30.JPG|thumb|Volunteer reads to a girl at the [[Casa Hogar de las Niñas]] in [[Mexico City]]]]
Currently most reading is either of the printed word from ink or [[toner]] on paper, such as in a [[book]], [[magazine]], [[newspaper]], [[Leaflet (information)|leaflet]], or [[notebook]], or of electronic displays, such as [[computer display]]s, [[television]], [[mobile phone]]s or [[e-reader]]s. [[Handwriting|Handwritten]] text may also be produced using a [[graphite]] [[pencil]] or a [[pen]].
Short texts may be written or [[paint]]ed on an object.

Often the text relates to the object, such as an address on an envelope, product info on packaging, or text on a [[traffic sign|traffic]] or street sign. A [[slogan]] may be painted on a wall. A text may also be produced by arranging stones of a different color in a wall or road. Short texts like these are sometimes referred to as environmental print.

Sometimes text or images are in [[relief]], with or without using a color contrast. Words or images can be carved in stone, wood, or metal; instructions can be printed in relief on the plastic housing of a [[home appliance]], or myriad other examples.

A requirement for reading is a good [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] between letters and background (depending on colors of letters and background, any pattern or image in the background, and [[lighting]]) and a suitable font size. In the case of a computer screen, it is important to see an entire line of text without [[scrolling]].

The field of visual word recognition studies how people read individual words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Cornelissen PL, Kringelbach ML, Ellis AW, Whitney C, Holiday IE, Hansen PC |title=Activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus in the first 200 ms of reading: evidence from magnetoencephalography (MEG) |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=e5359 |year=2009 |pmid=19396362 |pmc=2671164 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0005359|editor1-last=Aleman|editor1-first=André|last2=Kringelbach |last3=Ellis |last4=Whitney |last5=Holliday |last6=Hansen |bibcode=2009PLoSO...4.5359C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Wheat KL, Cornelissen PL, Frost SJ, Hansen PC |title=During visual word recognition, phonology is accessed within 100 ms and may be mediated by a speech production code: evidence from magnetoencephalography |journal= Journal of Neuroscience |volume=30 |issue=15 |pages=5229–33 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20392945 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4448-09.2010|pmc=3419470|last2=Cornelissen |last3=Frost |last4=Hansen }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Nation K |title=Form-meaning links in the development of visual word recognition |journal= Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

This has revealed that reading is performed as a series of eye [[fixation (visual)|fixations]] with [[saccade]]s between them. Humans also do not appear to fixate on every word in a text, but instead pause on some words mentally while their eyes are moving. This is possible because human languages show certain linguistic regularities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The process of recording information to read later is [[writing]]. In the case of computer and [[microfiche]] storage there is the separate step of displaying the written text. For humans, reading is usually faster and easier than writing.

Reading is typically an individual activity, though on occasion a person reads out loud for other listeners. Reading aloud for one's own use, for better comprehension, is a form of [[intrapersonal communication]]: in the early 1970s&lt;ref name="Pritchard 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pritchard SC, Coltheart M, Palethorpe S, Castles A |title=Nonword reading: comparing dual-route cascaded and connectionist dual-process models with human data |journal=J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=1268–88 |date=October 2012 |pmid=22309087 |doi=10.1037/a0026703 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been proposed the [[dual-route hypothesis to reading aloud]], accordingly to which there were two separate mental mechanisms, or cognitive routes, that are involved in this case, with output of both mechanisms contributing to the [[pronunciation]] of a written stimulus.&lt;ref name="Pritchard 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name=coltheart1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coltheart|first=Max|author2=Curtis, Brent |author3=Atkins, Paul |author4= Haller, Micheal |title=Models of reading aloud: Dual-route and parallel-distributed-processing approaches|journal=Psychological Review|date=1 January 1993|volume=100|issue=4|pages=589–608|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.100.4.589}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yamada 1990"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamada J, Imai H, Ikebe Y |title=The use of the orthographic lexicon in reading kana words |journal=J Gen Psychol |volume=117 |issue=3 |pages=311–23 |date=July 1990 |pmid=2213002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading to young children is a recommended way to instill language and expression, and to promote comprehension of text. [[Personalised books]] for children are recommended to improve engagement in reading by featuring the child themselves in the story.

Before the reintroduction of separated text in the late [[Middle Ages]], the ability to read silently was considered rather remarkable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stanford.edu/class/history34q/readings/Manguel/Silent_Readers.html | title=THE SILENT READERS | website=Alberto Manguel, Chapter 2 of A History of Reading (New York; Viking, 1996) | accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reading skills==
{{Main article|Learning to read}}
[[Literacy]] is the ability to use the symbols of a writing system. It is the ability to interpret what the information symbols represent, and re-create those same symbols so that others can derive the same meaning. [[Illiteracy]] is the inability to derive meaning from the symbols used in a writing system.
[[Dyslexia]] refers to a cognitive difficulty with reading and writing. It is defined as brain-based type of learning disability that specifically impairs a person's ability to read.&lt;ref name="nih"&gt;{{cite web|title=NINDS Dyslexia Information Page|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dyslexia/dyslexia.htm|publisher=National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke|accessdate=November 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727234247/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dyslexia/dyslexia.htm|archive-date=July 27, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term dyslexia can refer to two disorders: [[dyslexia|developmental dyslexia]]&lt;ref name='Heim'&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Heim S, Tschierse J, Amunts K |title=Cognitive subtypes of dyslexia |journal=Acta Neurobiologiae Experimentalis |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=73–82 |year=2008 |pmid=18389017 |url=http://www.ane.pl/linkout.php?pii=6809 |issn=0065-1400|last2=Tschierse |last3=Amunts |last4=Wilms |last5=Vossel |last6=Willmes |last7=Grabowska |last8=Huber }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Facoetti A |title=Auditory and visual automatic attention deficits in developmental dyslexia |journal=Brain Res Cogn Brain Res |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=185–91 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12668226 |doi=10.1016/S0926-6410(02)00270-7 |url= |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Lorusso ML |author3=Paganoni P |display-authors=3 |last4=Cattaneo |first4=Carmen |last5=Galli |first5=Raffaella |last6=Umiltà |first6=Carlo |last7=Mascetti |first7=Gian Gastone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=anchoring&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Ahissar M |title=Dyslexia and the anchoring-deficit hypothesis |journal=Trends Cogn.

===Reading rate===
[[File:Reading speed by age.jpg|thumb|Average reading rate in ''words per minute'' (wpm) depending on age and measured with different tests in English, French and German]]
Many studies show that increasing reading speed improves comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED523331.pdf|title=Reading Rate and Comprehension|last=Jodai|first=Hojat|date=August 2011|website=ERIC:ED523331}}&lt;/ref&gt;Reading speed requires a long time to reach adult levels. The table to the right shows how reading-rate varies with age,&lt;ref&gt;''Im Auge des Lesers, foveale und periphere Wahrnehmung: vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude''(2006), ppgs. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of the period (1965 to 2005) and the language (English, French, German). The Taylor values probably are higher, for disregarding students who failed the comprehension test. The reading test by the French psychologist Pierre Lefavrais ("L'alouette", published in 1967) tested reading aloud, with a penalty for errors, and could, therefore, not be a rate greater than 150 wpm. According to Carver (1990), children's reading speed increases throughout the school years. On average, from grade 2 to college, reading rate increases 14 standard-length words per minute each year (where one standard-length word is defined as six characters in text, including punctuation and spaces).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Carver, Ronald P. |title=Reading rate: a review of research and theory |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=1990 |pages= |isbn=978-0-12-162420-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the data from Taylor (English) and Landerl (German) are based on texts of increasing difficulty; other data were obtained when all age groups were reading the same text.

Rates of reading include reading for memorization (fewer than 100 [[words per minute]] [wpm]); reading for learning (100–200 wpm); reading for comprehension (200–400 wpm); and [[skimming (reading)|skimming]] (400–700 wpm). Reading for comprehension is the essence of the daily reading of most people. Skimming is for superficially processing large quantities of text at a low level of comprehension (below 50%).

Advice for choosing the appropriate reading-rate includes reading flexibly, slowing when concepts are closely presented and when the material is new, and increasing when the material is familiar and of thin concept. [[Speed reading]] courses and books often encourage the reader to continually accelerate; comprehension tests lead the reader to believe his or her comprehension is continually improving; yet, competence-in-reading requires knowing that skimming is dangerous, as a default [[Habit (psychology)|habit]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Scientific studies have demonstrated that reading—defined here as capturing and decoding all the words on every page—faster than 900 wpm is not feasible given the limits set by the anatomy of the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bremer|first1=Rod|title=The Manual: A Guide to the Ultimate Study Method|publisher=Fons Sapientiae Publishing|isbn=978-0-9934964-0-0|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cEFKjwEACAAJ&amp;dq=ultimate+study+method|date=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading speed has been used as a measure in research to determine the effect of interventions on human vision. A [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane Systematic Review]] used reading speed in words per minute as the primary outcome in comparing different reading aids for adults with low vision.&lt;ref name="Virgili"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Virgili G, Acosta R, Grover LL, Bentley SA, Giacomelli G |title= Reading aids for adults with low vision |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=10 |issue= 10 |pages= CD003303 |date=2013 |pmid= 24154864|pmc= 4288929 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD003303.pub3|last2= Acosta |last3= Grover |last4= Bentley |last5= Giacomelli }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29664159|date = July 2018}}

Lexical reading&lt;ref name='Neural Representations'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Ventral and Dorsal Streams'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Changes Reading Strategies'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Chinese Ventral and Dorsal Streams'/&gt; involves acquiring words or phrases without attention to the characters or groups of characters that compose them or by using [[whole language]] learning and teaching methodology. Some argue that this competes with phonics and synthetic phonics methods, and that the whole language approach tends to impair learning to spell.

Other methods of teaching and learning to read have developed, and become somewhat controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Feitelson |first=Dina |title=Facts and Fads in Beginning Reading: A Cross-Language Perspective |year=1988 |publisher=Ablex |location=Norwood, New Jersey, United States |isbn=978-0-89391-507-0 }}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Learning to read in a second language, especially in adulthood, may be a different process than learning to read a native language in childhood.
There are cases of very young children learning to read without having been taught.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Hughes, Diana |author2=Stainthorp, Rhona |title=Learning from children who read at an early age |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1999 |pages= |isbn=978-0-415-17495-4 }}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the case with [[Truman Capote]] who reportedly taught himself to read and write at the age of five. There are also accounts of people who taught themselves to read by comparing street signs or Biblical passages to speech. The novelist [[Nicholas Delbanco]] taught himself to read at age six during a transatlantic crossing by studying a book about boats.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Brain activity in young and older children can be used to predict future reading skill. Cross model mapping between the orthographic and phonologic areas in the brain are critical in reading. Thus, the amount of activation in the left dorsal inferior frontal gyrus while performing reading tasks can be used to predict later reading ability and advancement. Young children with higher phonological word characteristic processing have significantly better reading skills later on than older children who focus on whole-word orthographic representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McNorgan C, Alvarez A, Bhullar A, Gayda J, Booth JR |title=Prediction of reading skill several years later depends on age and brain region: implications for developmental models of reading |journal=[[The Journal of Neuroscience]] |volume=31 |issue=26 |pages=9641–8 |date=June 2011 |pmid=21715629 |pmc=3147303 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0334-11.2011 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=21715629|last2=Alvarez |last3=Bhullar |last4=Gayda |last5=Booth }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several types and methods of reading, with differing rates that can be attained for each, for different kinds of material and purposes:
* ''[[Subvocalization|Subvocalized]]'' reading combines sight reading with internal sounding of the words as if spoken. Advocates of speed reading claim it can be a bad habit that slows reading and comprehension, but other studies indicate the reverse, particularly with difficult texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Moidel|first=Steve|title=Speed Reading for Business|publisher=Barron's Educational|location=Hauppauge, NY|pages=23–24|isbn=978-0-7641-0401-5|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rayner|first=Keith|others=Pollatsek, Alexander|title=The Psychology of Reading|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=1995|pages=192–194|isbn=978-0-8058-1872-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Speed reading]]'' is a collection of methods for increasing reading speed without an unacceptable reduction in comprehension or retention. Methods include skimming or the [[chunking (psychology)|chunking]] of words in a body of text to increase the rate of reading. It is closely connected to [[speed learning]].
* ''[[Incremental reading]]'' is a software-assisted reading method designed for [[long-term memory|long-term memorization]]. "Incremental reading" means "reading in portions": in each session, parts of several electronic articles are read inside a prioritized reading list. In the course of reading, important pieces of information are extracted and converted into [[flashcard]]s, which are then reviewed by a [[spaced repetition]] algorithm.
* ''[[Proofreading]]'' is a kind of reading for the purpose of detecting [[typographical]] errors. One can learn to do it rapidly, and professional proofreaders typically acquire the ability to do so at high rates, faster for some kinds of material than for others, while they may largely suspend comprehension while doing so, except when needed to select among several possible words that a suspected typographic error allows.
* ''Rereading'' is reading a book more than once. "One cannot read a book: one can only reread it," [[Vladimir Nabokov]] once said.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Meyer Spacks (2011). ''On Rereading'', [[Harvard University Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-674-06222-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper published in the ''Journal of Consumer Research'' (Cristel Antonia (2012)) found re-reading offers mental health benefits because it allows for a more profound emotional connection and self-reflection, versus the first reading, which is more focused on the events and plot.&lt;ref&gt;Rob Waugh. [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2101516/Reading-book-really-better-second-time-round--reading-offer-mental-health-benefits.html "Reading a book really is better the second time round - and can even offer mental health benefits"], ''Daily Mail'', 15 Feb 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bookandpencil.png|thumb|250px|mini|right|Many take notes while reading.]]
* ''Structure-proposition-evaluation (SPE)'' method, popularized by [[Mortimer Adler]] in ''[[How to Read a Book]]'', mainly for non-fiction treatise, in which one reads a writing in three passes: (1) for the structure of the work, which might be represented by an outline; (2) for the logical propositions made, organized into chains of inference; and (3) for evaluation of the merits of the arguments and conclusions. This method involves [[suspended judgment]] of the work or its arguments until they are fully understood.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* ''Survey-question-read-recite-review ([[SQ3R]])'' method, often taught in public schools, which involves reading toward being able to teach what is read, and is appropriate for instructors preparing to teach material without referring to notes.
{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* ''[[Multiple intelligences]]''-based methods, which draw on the reader's diverse ways of thinking and knowing to enrich appreciation of the text. Reading is fundamentally a linguistic activity: one can basically comprehend a text without resorting to other intelligences, such as the visual (e.g., mentally "seeing" characters or events described), auditory (e.g., reading aloud or mentally "hearing" sounds described), or even the logical intelligence (e.g., considering "what if" scenarios or predicting how the text will unfold based on context clues). However, most readers already use several kinds of intelligence while reading. Doing so in a more disciplined manner—i.e., constantly, or after every paragraph—can result in a more vivid, memorable experience.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* ''[[Rapid serial visual presentation]] (RSVP)'' reading involves presenting the words in a sentence one word at a time at the same location on the display screen, at a specified eccentricity. RSVP eliminates inter-word saccades, limits intra-word saccades, and prevents reader control of fixation times (Legge, Mansfield, &amp; Chung, 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Legge GE, Mansfield JS, Chung ST |title=Psychophysics of reading. XX. Linking letter recognition to reading speed in central and peripheral vision |journal=Vision Research |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=725–43 |date=March 2001 |pmid=11248262 |doi=10.1016/S0042-6989(00)00295-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; RSVP controls for differences in reader eye movement, and consequently is often used to measure reading speed in experiments.
Reading process is therefore a communication context.

==Assessment==

===Types of tests===
* Sight word reading: reading words of increasing difficulty until they become unable to read or understand the words presented to them. Difficulty is manipulated by using words that have more letters or syllables, are less common and have more complicated spelling–sound relationships.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* Nonword reading: reading lists of pronounceable nonsense words out loud. The difficulty is increased by using longer words, and also by using words with more complex spelling or sound sequences.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.k12academics.com/educational-psychology/reading-activity/reading-assessment#.WKHjtneZNo4|title=Reading Assessment - K12 Academics|first=Chris|last=Glavin|date=6 February 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reading comprehension: a passage is presented to the reader, which they must read either silently or out loud. Then a series of questions are presented that test the reader's comprehension of this passage.
* Reading fluency: the rate with which individuals can name words.
* Reading accuracy: the ability to correctly name a word on a page.

Some tests incorporate several of the above components at once. For instance, the [[Nelson-Denny Reading Test]] scores readers both on the speed with which they can read a passage, and also their ability to accurately answer questions about this passage.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Recent research has questioned the validity of the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, especially with regard to the identification of reading disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Coleman C, Lindstrom J, Nelson J, Lindstrom W, Gregg KN |title=Passageless comprehension on the Nelson-Denny reading test: well above chance for university students |journal=J Learn Disabil |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=244–9 |year=2010 |pmid=19933897 |doi=10.1177/0022219409345017|last2=Lindstrom |last3=Nelson |last4=Lindstrom |last5=Gregg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive benefits==
Reading books and writing are among brain-stimulating activities shown to slow down cognitive decline in old age, with people who participated in more mentally stimulating activities over their lifetimes having a slower rate of decline in memory and other mental capacities.&lt;ref name=Neurology20130703&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/science/2013/07/being-a-lifelong-bookworm-may-keep-you-sharp-in-old-age/ |title=Being a Lifelong Bookworm May Keep You Sharp in Old Age |last=Koren |first=Marina |date=July 23, 2013 |website=Smithsonian |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ht0xyPkH?url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/science/2013/07/being-a-lifelong-bookworm-may-keep-you-sharp-in-old-age/ |archivedate=July 5, 2013 |access-date=July 5, 2013 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }} which cites {{Cite journal |url=http://neurology.org/content/early/2013/07/03/WNL.0b013e31829c5e8a |title= Life-span cognitive activity, neuropathologic burden, and cognitive aging|last=Wilson |first=Robert S. |date=July 3, 2013 |journal=Neurology |volume=81 |issue=4 |pages=314–321 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ht0Ia2PN?url=http://neurology.org/content/early/2013/07/03/WNL.0b013e31829c5e8a |archivedate=July 5, 2013 |display-authors=etal |access-date=July 5, 2013 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all |doi=10.1212/WNL.0b013e31829c5e8a |pmid=23825173 |pmc=3772831 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reading for pleasure has been linked to increased cognitive progress in vocabulary and mathematics during adolescence.

==Effects==
[[File:Nigth reading.JPG|thumb|Night reading has benefits to calm the nerves by eliminating excess sound and vision stimulus resulting in better sleep.]]

===Lighting===
Reading from paper and from some screens requires more [[lighting]] than many other activities. Therefore, the possibility of doing this comfortably in [[café]]s, [[restaurant]]s, [[bus]]es, at [[bus stop]]s or in [[park]]s greatly varies depending on available lighting and time of day.

Reading from screens that produce their own light does not depend on external light, except that external light may lessen visual fatigue. For controlling what is on the screen ([[scrolling]], turning the page, etc.), a [[touch screen]] or [[Keyboard (computing)#Illumination|keyboard illumination]] further reduces dependency on external light.

==History==
[[File:Men reading the Koran in Umayyad Mosque, Damascus, Syria.jpg|thumb|Men reading]]
The history of reading dates back to the [[History of writing|invention of writing]] during the 4th millennium BC. Although reading [[printing|print]] text is now an important way for the general population to access information, this has not always been the case. With [[Literacy#Ancient and medieval literacy|some exceptions]], only a small percentage of the population in many countries was considered [[Literacy|literate]] before the [[industrial revolution|Industrial Revolution]]. Some of the pre-modern societies with generally high literacy rates included [[classical Athens]] and the Islamic [[Caliphate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Delivering Education|author = Andrew J. Coulson|page = 117|publisher = [[Hoover Institution]]|url = http://media.hoover.org/documents/0817928928_105.pdf|accessdate = 2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars assume that reading aloud (Latin ''clare legere'') was the more common practice in antiquity, and that reading silently (''legere tacite'' or ''legere sibi'') was unusual.&lt;ref name="Carruthers"&gt;Carruthers, Mary. 2008. ''The Book of Memory: A Study of Memory in Medieval Culture''. 2nd. ed. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 212 ff..&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Confessions (St. Augustine)|''Confessions'']], [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] remarks on [[Ambrose|Saint Ambrose]]'s unusual habit of reading silently in the 4th century AD.&lt;ref name="Carruthers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jajdelska, Elspeth. 2007. ''Silent Reading and the Birth of the Narrator''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], elite individuals promoted passive reading, rather than creative interpretation. Reading has no concrete laws, but lets readers escape to produce their own products introspectively, promoting deep exploration of texts during interpretation. Some thinkers of that era believed that construction, or the creation of writing and producing a product, was a sign of initiative and active participation in society—and viewed consumption (reading) as simply taking in what constructors made.&lt;ref name="Certeau, Michel 1984"/&gt; Also during this era, writing was considered superior to reading in society. They considered readers of that time passive citizens, because they did not produce a product. [[Michel de Certeau]] argued that the elites of the Age of Enlightenment were responsible for this general belief. Michel de Certeau believed that reading required venturing into an author's land, but taking away what the reader wanted specifically. This view held that writing was a superior art to reading within the hierarchical constraints of the era.&lt;ref name="Certeau, Michel 1984"/&gt;

In 18th-century Europe, the then new practice of reading alone in bed was, for a time, considered dangerous and immoral. As reading became less a communal, oral practice, and more a private, silent one—and as [[sleeping]] increasingly moved from communal sleeping areas to individual bedrooms, some raised concern that reading in bed presented various dangers, such as fires caused by bedside candles. Some modern critics, however, speculate that these concerns were based on the fear that readers—especially women—could escape familial and communal obligations and transgress moral boundaries through the private fantasy worlds in books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mavrody|first1=Nika|title=The Dangers of Reading in Bed|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/05/reading-in-bed/527388/|accessdate=23 May 2017|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5157">The '''Robin Hood effect''' is an [[economic]] occurrence where [[income]] is [[income redistribution|redistributed]] so that [[economic inequality]] is reduced.  The effect is named after [[Robin Hood]], said to have stolen from the rich to give to the poor.

==Causes of a Robin Hood effect==

A Robin Hood effect can be caused by a large number of different policies or economic decisions, not all of which are specifically aimed at reducing inequality.  This article lists only some of these.

===Natural national development===

[[Image:Kuznets curve.png|right|320px|thumb|A Kuznets curve]]

{{main|Kuznets curve}}

[[Simon Kuznets]] argued that one major factor behind levels of economic inequality is the stage of [[economic development]] of a country. Kuznets described a curve-like relationship between level of income and inequality, as shown. That theory prescribes that countries with very low levels of development will have relatively equal distributions of wealth.

As a country develops, it necessarily acquires more capital, and the owners of this capital will then have more wealth and income, which introduces inequality. However, eventually various possible redistribution mechanisms such as [[trickle down effect]]s and [[social welfare]] programs will lead to a Robin Hood effect, with wealth redistributed to the poor.  Therefore, more developed countries move back to lower levels of inequality.

===Non-proportional income tax===

Many countries have an [[income tax]] system where the first part of a worker's salary is taxed very little or not at all, while those on higher salaries must pay a higher tax rate on earnings over a certain threshold, known as [[progressive taxation]]. This has the effect of the better-off population paying a higher proportion of their salary in tax, effectively subsidising the less-well off, leading to a Robin Hood effect.

Specifically, a progressive tax is a [[tax]] by which the [[tax rate]] increases as the taxable base amount increases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Progressive Webster] (4b): increasing in rate as the base increases (a progressive tax)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/69/P0586900.html American Heritage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209142138/http://bartleby.com/61/69/P0586900.html |date=2009-02-09 }} (6). Increasing in rate as the taxable amount increases.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1B1-375969.html Britannica Concise Encyclopedia]: Tax levied at a rate that increases as the quantity subject to taxation increases.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=Progressive+tax Princeton University WordNet]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}: (n) progressive tax (any tax in which the rate increases as the amount subject to taxation increases)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sommerfeld"&gt;Sommerfeld, Ray M., Silvia A. Madeo, Kenneth E. Anderson, Betty R. Jackson (1992), ''Concepts of Taxation'', Dryden Press: Fort Worth, TX&lt;/ref&gt; "Progressive" describes a distribution effect on [[income]] or [[Consumption (economics)|expenditure]], referring to the way the rate progresses from low to high, where the average tax rate is less than the marginal tax rate.&lt;ref name="Hyman"&gt;Hyman, David M. (1990) ''Public Finance: A Contemporary Application of Theory to Policy'', 3rd, Dryden Press: Chicago, IL&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="James"&gt;James, Simon (1998) ''A Dictionary of Taxation'', Edgar Elgar Publishing Limited: Northampton, MA&lt;/ref&gt; It can be applied to individual taxes or to a tax system as a whole; a year, multi-year, or lifetime. Progressive taxes attempt to reduce the [[tax incidence]] of people with a lower [[wikt:ability-to-pay|ability-to-pay]], as they shift the incidence increasingly to those with a higher ability-to-pay.

===Cross-subsidisation of mobile telephony===

In many developing countries, [[cellular network|mobile communications networks]] tend to experience a large [[network effect|network externality]], which regulators and operators seek to correct by subsidising subscriptions through increased prices for [[call termination]]. That then allows the less-well off in that country to gain access to communications services, often for free (on a [[prepaid mobile phone|prepay tariff]]). The additional cost is then levied on subscribers who make calls to these new subscribers; the call originators tend to be better-off. Therefore, despite there being no direct transfer of money, there is a strong Robin Hood effect, with the better-off subsidising the less well-off.

'''Rudeness''' (also called '''effrontery''') is a display of disrespect by not complying with the [[Norm (social)|social norms]] or [[etiquette]] of a group or culture. These norms have been established as the essential [[personal boundaries|boundaries]] of normally [[acceptance|accepted]] behavior. To be unable or unwilling to align one's behavior with these norms known to the general population of what is socially acceptable is to be rude and are enforced as though they were a sort of social law, with social repercussions or rewards for violators or advocates, respectively. 

Rudeness, "constituted by deviation from whatever counts as politic in a given social context, is inherently confrontational and disruptive to social equilibrium".{{sfn|Kasper|1990|p=208}}  Rudeness, particularly with respect to speech, is necessarily confrontational at its core.

Forms of rudeness include acting inconsiderate, insensitive, deliberately offensive, [[Politeness|impolite]], a faux pas, [[obscenity]], [[profanity]] and violating [[taboo]]s such as [[deviancy]]. In some cases, an act of rudeness can go so far as to be a [[crime]], for example, the crime of [[hate speech]].

==Relationship to morality==
Both [[manners]] and [[morality]] deal with whether a thing is morally good or bad, but  at different levels.  Unlike morality, which, for example, condemns [[murder]] as a violation of a person, manners primarily concerns itself with violations of human [[dignity]], rather than the person's health or property.{{sfn|Martin|1996|p=123}}  Rude behaviour is a violation of human dignity or of the respect due to others.

==Cultural differences==
{{Main|Intercultural competence}}

The specific actions that are considered polite or rude vary dramatically by place, time, and context.  Differences in [[social role]], [[gender]], [[social class]], [[religion]], and [[cultural identity]] may all affect the appropriateness of a given behaviour.  Consequently, a behaviour that is considered perfectly acceptable by one group of people may be considered clearly rude by another.  For example, in [[medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] [[Europe]], it was rude to indicate that a man wearing a [[mask]] in public could be recognized.{{sfn|Palleschi|2005}}  Instead, polite behaviour demanded that the masked person be treated as a completely unknown person and that no one ever attribute the masked person's actions to the individual who performed them.  By contrast, in the modern era, greeting a friend by name while he is wearing a mask, or talking to them later about their costume or activities, is not generally regarded as rude.

Cultural differences also appear over time.  In the mid-20th century, the meaning of [[eye rolling]] changed from its older signal of lust and passion to expressing contempt.{{sfn|Wickman|2013}}

==Utility==
Sometimes, people deliberately employ rude behaviours to achieve a goal.  Early works in [[linguistic pragmatism]] interpreted rudeness as a defective mode of communication.  However, most rudeness serves functional or instrumental purposes in communication, and skillfully choosing when and how to be rude may indicate a person's pragmatic competence.

{{harvnb|Lakoff|1989}} addressed what she named 'strategic rudeness,' a style of communication used by prosecutors and therapists to force their interlocutors (a courtroom defendant or patient) to talk or react in a certain way.  Rudeness in everyday speech "is frequently instrumental, and is not merely pragmatic failure".{{sfn|Beebe|1995|p=154}}  Most rude speakers are attempting to accomplish one of two important instrumental functions:  to vent negative feelings, and/or to get [[Power (social and political)|power]].{{sfn|Beebe|1995|p=159}}

== Examples ==
In every culture, it is possible to act rudely, although what constitutes rude behaviour varies.  The following are examples of behaviour that many Western societies would consider ''rude'' or a breach of etiquette, though views may vary by culture, setting, or individual circumstances: 
&lt;!--

NOTE:  The goal is *NOT* to provide a comprehensive list of rude behaviours, or to create a "How to Be Rude" manual.

Please don't include items that are more accurately described as "unkind" (gossip) or "lazy" (not cutting the lawn often enough to suit the neighbours) or tautologies (things that are defined as rude, such as "rude gestures" or "rude words").

--&gt;

=== Speech ===
What constitutes rude speech depends on the culture, the setting, and the speaker's social position in the culture. In every culture, some words or statements are considered [[hate speech]] or inappropriate [[list of ethnic slurs|ethnic slurs]] (such as using the word ''[[Hun#20th-century_use_in_reference_to_Germans|Hun]]'' to a [[German people|German]], using the word ''[[Jap]]'' to a [[Japanese people|Japanese person]], etc.). In most modern cultures, [[insult]]ing a person or group of people, especially for any reason outside their immediate control, such as having a medical condition, following a particular religion, or being poor, is considered rude. Rude speech also includes derogatory terms describing an individual person and asking inappropriate questions or pressing for answers to a question.

However, there is no universal rule about which terms are considered derogatory and which questions are inappropriate under what circumstances.  A question or comment that is acceptable between family members might be resented from strangers, just like a question that is acceptable among young people in one culture might be unacceptable to older people or to young people in a different culture.

Rude ways of speaking include inappropriately discouraging a person's participation in a conversation with rude phrases, such as {{wikt-lang|en|shut up}} or using a [[tone of voice]] that indicates disrespect for the other person.  An impolite tone may amplify obviously rude remarks or contradict nominally polite words.  A rude person may interrupt a speaker to indicate that the first speaker is unimportant.

Failing to speak can also be rude:  a rude person might pointedly ignore a legitimate and polite greeting or question to communicate disregard for the other person, or might fail to express appropriate [[gratitude|thanks]] for favors or gifts by way of communicating either a sense of selfish entitlement or a disregard for the efforts of the giver.  Sometimes people will leave very short gaps when speaking that may allow another person to begin speaking on a subject, however that can vary, and sometimes two or more people speaking at the same time can be considered rude.  Which acts and communications require a response from which persons, under which circumstances, and what kind of response is required, depends on the culture and the social situation of the people concerned.

=== Behaviours ===
Many behaviours can be rude.  These often depend upon the context, including time, place, and culture.

This includes a failure to [[dress code|dress appropriately]] for an occasion, whether by dressing too informally, too formally, immodestly, or otherwise inappropriately (e.g., a young woman in public without a veil in Iran; a young woman in public with a veil in France).  [[C. S. Lewis]] writes that "A girl in the Pacific islands wearing hardly any clothes and a Victorian lady completely covered in clothes might both be equally 'modest,' proper, or decent, according to the standards of their own societies"—but that in each culture, the idea of immodest, improper, and indecent dress existed, and that violating the culture's standard was rude.{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=94}}

Rude behaviours often disturb other people, such as making [[noise]] or playing loud music.  An acceptable level of sound depends on the context:  yelling might be the only way to be heard at a noisy [[construction site]], and [[rock concert]]s are expected to feature loud music, but a conversation at a normal level, either by telephone or in person, might be rude in an environment where a reasonable degree of silence is expected, such as a [[library]], and complete silence is expected at other times, such as during religious ceremonies or performances of classical music.  This includes speaking over a presentation or film with no consideration for the other viewers.  Similarly, poor [[table manners]] can disturb or [[disgust]] nearby people, as can [[yawn]]ing, [[cough]]ing, [[fart]]ing or [[sneeze|sneezing]] without covering the mouth.

Other rude behaviours have the effect of communicating disrespect for other people.  In extreme cases, this can rise to complete and deliberate [[social exclusion]] of the disrespected person; in others, the rudeness is only temporary and may be unintentional.  For example, it can be rude to use electronic devices, such as [[mobile phone]]s, if this results in ignoring someone or otherwise indicating that the present company is less interesting or important than the people elsewhere or the text messages they send.  Similarly, [[cutting in line]] signals that the person cutting in the line believes themselves to be more important that the people their action delays.  Barging into someone else's space without permission, whether that be a violation of [[personal space]] or [[Party crashing|crashing a party]], is rude because it does not respect the person's property rights or right to make personal choices.

Other examples include:
*[[Bullying]] or [[intimidating]] people with the threat of violence
*[[Snob]]bery
*[[Aggressive driving]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1797">'''Scottish Assessors''' (the '''Scottish Assessors Association''', SSA) is a voluntary, non-statutory association of [[Assessor (property)|land valuation assessors]] and their senior staff in [[Scotland]]. The association encourages a consistent approach to the administration of [[valuation (rates)|valuation]], [[council tax]] and [[Electoral registration in the United Kingdom|electoral registration]].

Founded in 1975, in conjunction with the abolition of the [[Scottish counties]], Scottish Assessors is the successor to the ''Association of Lands Valuation Assessors of Scotland'', founded in 1957, and the ''Association of Lands Valuation Assessors'', founded in 1886.

The SAA liaises with the [[Valuation Office Agency]] of England and Wales, the [[Valuation Office]] (Oifig Luachála) of Ireland, and the [[Land and Property Service]] in Northern Ireland.

==Assessors==
Scottish [[Assessor (property)|Assessors]] are independent public officials who decide the rateable value of property listed on a local valuation roll. They must be members of the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]] and work under the umbrella body, the Scottish Assessors Association.

The '''Scottish government economy directorates''' were a set of [[:wikt:directorate|directorates]] within the [[Scottish government]], the executive arm of the devolved government of [[Scotland]].  The directorates were headed by Dr [[Andrew Goudie (economist)|Andrew Goudie]], who also acted as the chief economic adviser to the Scottish government (Goudie retired in 2011 and joined [[University of Strathclyde|Strathclyde University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-14268157|title=Andrew Goudie to take up Strathclyde University role|website=BBC News|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''Sensory design''' aims to establish an overall diagnosis of the [[Sense|sensory perceptions]] of a product, and define appropriate means to [[design]] or redesign it on that basis. It involves an observation of the diverse and varying situations in which a given product or object is used in order to measure the users' overall opinion of the product, its positive and negative aspects in terms of [[Somatosensory system|tactility]], [[Visual perception|appearance]], [[Hearing (sense)|sound]] and so on.

Sensory assessment aims to quantify and describe, in a systematic manner, all human [[Perception#Types|perceptions]] when confronted with a product or object. Contrary to traditional laboratory analysis, a sensory analysis of a product is either carried out by a panel of  [[Psychological testing|trained testers]], or by specialized test equipment designed to mimic the perception of humans.

The result allows researchers to establish a list of specifications and to set out a precise and quantified requirement. These are applied to materials and objects using various criteria:
* [[Somatosensory system|Touch]], textures, compliance, friction.
* [[Visual system|Vision]] color, luminosity, shape, pattern.
* [[Sound]]s and [[:wiki:movement|movement]]s made when a product is handled;
* [[Olfaction|Smell]];
* [[Taste]];
* [[Temperature]] and perceived thermal properties

==Use in Transportation==
In the [[transport]]ation sphere, these two branches of [[sensory analysis]] translate into sometimes minor enhancements to the design for a vehicle interior, information system, or station environment to smooth some of the rougher edges of the travel experience.&lt;ref name="Railway"&gt;{{cite web | last=Kingsley | first=Nick | title=Railway Gazette: Sensolab drives interior experimentation | url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/sensolab-drives-interior-experimentation.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, specialized air purifying equipment can be used to design a more pleasant odor.&lt;ref name="Interior"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leone|first1=Catherine|title=Come to Your Senses|url=http://www.iida.org/content.cfm/come-to-your-senses|website=International Interior Design Association|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in Food and Beverage==
Sensory design plays a critical role the modern food and beverage industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moskowitz|first1=Howard|title=Sensory and Consumer Research in Food Product Design and Development|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-8138-1366-0|edition=2|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0813813662.html|date=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The food and beverage industry attempts to maintain specific sensory experiences. In addition to smell and flavor, the color of food (e.g. ripe fruits),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mendoza|first1=Fernando|title=Calibrated color measurements of agricultural foods using image analysis|journal=Postharvest Biology and Technology|volume=41|issue=3|pages=285–295|doi=10.1016/j.postharvbio.2006.04.004|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925521406001116|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and texture of food (e.g. potato chips) are critical. Even the environment is important as "Color affects the appetite, in essence, the taste of food".&lt;ref name="Interior" /&gt;

==Sensory Design Technologies==
While classically limited to the perception of trained sensory experts, advances in sensors and computation have allowed objective quantified measurements of sensory information to be acquired, quantified and communicated leading to improved design communication, translation from prototype to production, and quality assurance. Sensory areas that have been objectively quantified include vision, touch, and smell.

===Vision===
In vision both light and color are considered in sensory design. Early [[light meter]]s (called extinction meters) relied on the human eye to gauge and quantify the [[Luminosity function|amount of light]]. Subsequently, analog and digital light meters have been popularized for photography. Work by Lawrence Herbert in the 1960s lead to a systematic combination of lighting and color samples required to quantify colors by human eye. This became the basis for the [[pantone|Pantone Matching System]]. Combining this with specialized light meters allowed digital color meters to be invented and popularized.

===Touch===
Touch plays an important role in a variety of products and is increasingly considered in product design and marketing efforts and has led to a more scientific approach to tactile design and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spence|first1=Charles|title=Multisensory design: Reaching out to touch the consumer|journal=Psychology and Marketing|date=3 March 2015|volume=28|issue=3|pages=267–308|doi=10.1002/mar.20392|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229911988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical the field of tribology has developed various tests to evaluate interacting surfaces in relative motion with a focus on measuring friction, lubrication, and wear. However these measurements do not correlate with human 
perception.&lt;ref name="Bayesian"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fishel|first1=Jeremy|title=Bayesian exploration for intelligent identification of textures|journal=Frontiers in Neurorobotics|date=18 June 2012|volume=6|pages=4|doi=10.3389/fnbot.2012.00004|pmid=22783186|pmc=3389458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative methods for evaluating how materials feel were first popularized from work initiated at Kyoto University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kawabata Evaluation System for Fabrics|url=http://www.kod.tul.cz/laboratore/Kes/index_eng.html|website=Kawabata Laboratory|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309134855/http://www.kod.tul.cz/laboratore/Kes/index_eng.html|archivedate=2016-03-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kawabata evaluation system developed six measurements &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lahey|first1=Timothy|title=Modelling Hysteresis in the Bending of Fabrics|date=2002|pages=17–21|url=http://etd.uwaterloo.ca/etd/tjlahey2002.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; of how fabrics feel.

===Smell===
Measuring odors has remained difficult. A variety of techniques have been attempted but “Most measures have had a subjective component that makes them anachronistic with modern methodology in experimental behavioral science, indeterminate regarding the extent of individual differences, unusable with infra humans and of unproved ability to discern small differences”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wise|first1=Paul|title=Quantification of Odor Quality|journal=Chemical Senses|date=2000|volume=25|issue=4|pages=429–443|doi=10.1093/chemse/25.4.429|url=http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/4/429.full|pmid=10944507}}&lt;/ref&gt; New methods for robotic exploration of smell are being proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loutfi|first1=Amy|title=Smell, think and act: A cognitive robot discriminating odours|journal=Autonomous Robots|date=8 June 2006|volume=20|issue=3|pages=239–249|doi=10.1007/s10514-006-7098-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41885">The '''seven rays''' is an [[occult]] concept that has appeared in several religions and [[esoteric]] philosophies in both Western culture and in India since at least the sixth century BCE. Also they are known as gods or angels from different planets or can be called fallen angels.

In the west, it can be seen in early [[western mystery tradition]]s such as [[Gnosticism]] and [[Mithraism]]; and in texts and [[icon]]ic art of the [[Catholic Church]] as early as the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Woman's Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets |author=Barbara G.

Beginning in the late 19th century, the seven rays appeared in a modified and elaborated form in the teachings of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], first presented by [[Helena Blavatsky]].&lt;ref name="long"/&gt;  The Theosophical concept of the seven rays was further developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the writings of Theosophist [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], and by other authors such as [[Alice Bailey]], [[Manly P. Hall]], and others, including notably the teachings of [[Benjamin Creme]] and his group [[Share International]];&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin.

As the [[New Age]] movement of the mid-to-late 20th century developed, the seven rays concept appeared as an element of metaphysical healing methods such as [[Reiki]] and other modalities,&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spirit of Reiki|author=Carolyn E.

==In Antiquity==

In ancient [[Greek mythology]], [[Zeus]] takes the bull-form known as Taurus in order to win [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]]. Taurus is also associated with [[Aphrodite]] and other goddesses, as well as with [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and [[Dionysus]]. The face of Taurus "gleams with seven rays of fire."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', v.164.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chaldean Oracles]] of the 2nd century CE feature the seven rays as purifying agents of [[Helios]], symbolism featured in [[Mithraic Mysteries|Mithraic]] liturgy as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ow0VAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=chaldean+Seven+Rays&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=08IwTY6kLMG88gaB-MGdCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=chaldean%20Seven%20Rays&amp;f=false "The Chaldean oracles: text, translation, and commentary" by Julianus (the Theurgist.), Ruth Dorothy Majercik, ed., p.38]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the 4th century, [[Julian the Apostate|Emperor Julian Saturnalia]] composed a ''Hymn to the Solemn Sun'', and in his ''Hymn to the Mother of the Gods'' spoke of "unspeakable mysteries hidden from the crowd such as Julian the Chaldean prophesied concerning the god of the seven rays."  In Greek Gnostic magic of the same era, colored gemstones were often used as [[amulet|talisman]]s for medicine or healing; they were often engraved with a symbol borrowed from the Egyptian deity [[Chnuphis]]: a hooded serpent or great snake. The snake was shown with a lion's head, from which emanated either twelve or seven rays. The twelve rays represented the [[zodiac]], and the seven rays represented the planets, usually with the seven Greek vowels engraved at the tips of the seven rays. The reverse sides of the talismans were engraved with a snake twisting around a vertical rod. These were known as "Gnostic [[amulet]]s" and were sometimes also engraved with the names ''Iao Sabao'' ([[Archon#Gnosticism|the Archon Iao]]).&lt;ref name="Thorndike"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Magic and Experimental Science|author=Lynn Thorndike |publisher=Columbia University Press |year= 1958 |pages=317–318, 379 |isbn= 0-231-08794-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gnostic gems with [[Abraxas]] also featured the seven rays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/gno/gar/gar31.htm#page_218 "Part III.

In early Christian iconography, the dove of the Holy Ghost is often shown with an emanation of seven rays, as is the image of the Madonna, often in conjunction with a dove or doves.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Divine Domesticity: Augustine of Thagaste to Teresa of Avila |author=Marjorie O'Rourke Boyle |publisher=BRILL |year= 1997 |isbn= 90-04-10675-8 |page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Monastery of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai, circa 565 CE, shows the [[Transfiguration of Christ]] in the apse mosaic, with "seven rays of light shining from the luminous body of Christ over the apostles Peter, James and John."&lt;ref name="Schroer"/&gt;  In the present day Byzantine-style St. Louis Cathedral in Missouri, the center of the sanctuary has an engraved circle with many symbols of the [[Holy Trinity]].

During the 12th century, [[Saint Norbert of Xanten]], founder of the Order of Canons Regular of Prémontré, discovered the spot where the [[relics]] of [[Saint Ursula]] and her companions of [[Saint Gereon]] and of other martyrs lay hidden while in a dream. In the dream that led him to this location, he was guided by "the seven rays of light... surrounding the head of the crucified Redeemer."&lt;ref name="Bartoli"&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the Life and Institute of St. Ignatius de Loyola: Founder of the Society of Jesus |author=Daniello Bartoli |publisher=E.

[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|The Annunciation]] is an oil painting by [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] master [[Jan van Eyck]], from around 1434-1436. The picture depicts the [[Annunciation]] by the [[Archangel Gabriel]] to the [[Virgin Mary]] that she will bear the Son of God ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 1:26-38). In a prominent element of the complex iconographic work, the [[Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]] descend to her on seven rays of light from the upper window to the left, with the dove symbolising the [[Holy Spirit]] following the same path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jan van Eyck, Netherlandish, c. 1390 - 1441, The Annunciation, c. 1434/1436|url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/gg39/gg39-49.0.html |publisher=National Gallery of Art|quote=The Holy Spirit descends to her on seven rays of light.

Only the seven rays are so treated, and while all of the other light sources in the painting cast shadows, the seven rays do not.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, E.

The Italian [[secret society]] of the late 17th century, [[Knights of the Apocalypse]], was founded with the professed aim to defend the [[Catholicism|Catholic Church]] against the expected [[Antichrist]], though it was accused of having political motives as well. They wore on their breasts a star with seven rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Apocalypse, Knights of the |volume=2|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Hindu scripture==
[[File:Agni and consort.jpg|thumb|The seven-armed Agni with his wife.]]
[[Agni]] is a [[Hindu]] and [[Rigvedic deities|Vedic deity]] depicted in three forms: fire, lightning and the sun. In Hindu art, Agni is depicted with two or seven hands, two heads, and three legs. In each head, he has seven fiery tongues with which he licks sacrificial butter. He rides a ram or a chariot harnessed by fiery horses. His attributes are an axe, a torch, prayer beads and a flaming spear. Agni is represented as red and two-faced, suggesting both his destructive and his beneficent qualities, and with black eyes and hair. Seven rays of light emanate from his body.&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Hindu Imagery: Gods, Manifestations and Their Meaning By Eva Rudy Jansen p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vishnu Purana]], a [[vedas|post-vedic]] scripture, describes how [[Vishnu]] "enters into the seven solar rays which dilate into seven suns." These are the "seven principal solar rays," the source of heat even to the planet Jupiter, and the "seven suns into which the seven solar rays dilate at the consummation of all things..."&lt;ref name="Garrett"/&gt;

20th century Hindu scholar, poet and mystic, [[Sri Aurobindo]], described the Vedic seven rays of knowledge, or [[Agni]], as "the seven forms of the Thought-principle" and wrote that "the seven brilliant horses of the sun and their full union constitutes the seven-headed Thought of Ayasya by which the lost sun of Truth is recovered. That thought is again established in the seven rivers, the seven principles of being divine and human, the totality of which founds the perfect spiritual existence."&lt;ref name="Aurobindo"/&gt;

==Syncretistic interpretations==

Egyptologist [[Gerald Massey]] wrote in 1881 of what he described as connections between Vedic scripture, ancient Egyptian mythology and the Gospel stories.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Massey Collection-Upper Norwood Joint Library&lt;/ref&gt; He theorized that [[Archon#Gnosticism|the Archon Iao]], the "Seven-rayed Sun-God of the Gnostic-stones" was also the "Serpent Chnubis," and "the Second Beast in the Book of Revelation."&lt;ref name="massey-genesis"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Natural Genesis |author=Gerald Massey  |publisher=Black Classic Press |year= 1998 |edition=from original published circa 1881 |pages=366, 369}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, he elaborated further, describing the unity of "the seven souls of the Pharaoh," "the seven arms of the Hindu god [[Agni]]," "the seven stars in the hand of the Christ in Revelation," and "the seven rays of the Chaldean god Heptaktis, or Iao, on the Gnostic stones."&lt;ref name="massey-lectures"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gerald Massey's Lectures |author=Gerald Massey  |publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year= 1992 |edition=from original published posthumously circa 1900 |page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samuel Fales Dunlap, wrote in 1894:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Moses was of the race of the Chaldeans. The Chaldean Mithra had his Seven Rays, and Moses his Seven Days. The other planets which circling around the sun lead the dance as round the King of heaven receive from him with the light also their powers; while as the light comes to them from the sun so from him they receive their powers that he pours out into the Seven Spheres of the Seven Planets of which the sun is the centre.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dunlap wrote that the idea of spirit as the ultimate cause is present in all of the great religions of the East (which in the terminology of his time included the area now known as the Near East or Middle East), and that this idea can be found in "the Seven Rays of the Chaldaean [[Mithraic mysteries|Mithra]] and the Seven Days of Genesis. From the Sun came fire and spirit." According to Dunlap, "this was the astronomical religion of the Chaldeans, Jews, Persians, Syrians, Phoenicians and Egyptians."&lt;ref name="dunlap"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ghebers of Hebron: An Introduction to the Gheborim in the Lands of the Sethim, the Mithra mysteries &amp;c.|author=Samuel Fales Dunlap | publisher=G Redway &amp; JW Bouton |year= 1894 |pages=reface, iii-vi |edition=Original from the University of California }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunlap compared the [[Halo (religious iconography)#Ancient Greek world|nimbus]] of [[Apollo]] to the seven rays of [[Dionysus]], presiding over the orbits of the seven planets. The seven rays are found also in the Chaldean mystery of "the God of the Seven Rays, who held the Seven Stars in his hand, through whom (as Chaldaeans supposed) the souls were raised." Prior to the Christian era, this deity was known as Iao (the first birth) or  [[Sabaoth]] (the Sun), and later described as "Christos of the Resurrection of Souls."&lt;ref name="dunlap2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ghebers of Hebron: An Introduction to the Gheborim in the Lands of the Sethim, the Mithramsyteries &amp;c.|author=Samuel Fales Dunlap |publisher=G.

In the late 1940s, art historian and writer [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] was curator in the department of Asiatic Art at the Boston [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] and built the first large collection of Indian art in the United States. His writings in the field of [[perennial philosophy]] and the [[Traditionalist School]] included complex essays collating symbols of ancient wisdom and metaphysics from widely diverse cultures including Indian, Islamic, Chinese, Hellenic, and Christian sources. He wrote that the seven rays of the sun appear in both Hindu and Christian symbolism, representing similar concepts, and in particular the symbolism of the seventh ray that "corresponds to the distinction of transcendent from immanent and of infinite from finite." He added that of "our Axis of the Universe ([[Stambha|skambha]], divo dharuna, etc.) and Islamic [[Qutb]] ..... The seventh ray alone passes through the Sun to the suprasolar Brahma worlds, "where no sun shines" ('all that is under the Sun being in the power of Death, and all beyond immortal')."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Door in the Sky: Coomaraswamy on Myth and Meaning |author=Ananda K.

==In Theosophy==
{{Theosophy}}
Syncretism is one of the core principles of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], a religious philosophy originating with [[Madame Blavatsky|Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] from the 1870s, and the seven rays appear repeatedly in the related writings. Theosophy holds that all [[religion]]s are attempts by the "[[Spiritual Hierarchy]]" to help humanity in evolving to greater perfection, and that each religion therefore has a portion of the truth.

Blavatsky wrote in the first book of ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' of an " analogy between the Aryan or Brahmanical and the Egyptian esotericism" and that the "seven rays of the Chaldean Heptakis or Iao, on the Gnostic stones" represent the seven large stars of the Egyptian "Great Bear" constellation, the seven elemental powers, and the Hindu "seven Rishis." She stated that the seven rays of the Vedic sun deity Vishnu represent the same concept as the "astral fluid or 'Light' of the Kabalists," and that the seven emanations of the lower seven [[sephirot]]h are the "primeval seven rays," and "will be found and recognized in every religion."&lt;ref name="doctrine1-129"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy |author=Helena Petrovna Blavatsky  |publisher=Theosophical Publishing Society |year= 1893 |edition=Original from Harvard University (2 volumes) |pages=vol 1, p 129–130, 523, 573–4 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second volume of the ''Secret Doctrine'', Blavatsky discusses the "seven nervous plexuses of the body" and the seven rays they radiate, stating that this principle is found in the [[Rig Veda]], in the mythology of [[Ahura Mazda]], in the beliefs of the Incas, the Chinese Yao, and the Egyptian Osiris, who "when he enters the ark, or solar boat, takes seven Rays with him." She describes the "seven wise ones" of the Veda as "the seven Rays which fall free from the macrocosmic centre".&lt;ref name="doctrine2-564"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy |author=Helena Petrovna Blavatsky  |publisher=Theosophical Publishing Society |year= 1893 |edition=Original from Harvard University (2 volumes) |pages=vol 2, p 143, 191 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blavatsky summarizes the syncretistic principle of her doctrine as it relates to the seven rays:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...a key which reveals to us on indisputable grounds of comparative analogy... the Indian phœnix, the emblem of cyclic and periodical time, the "man-lion" Singha, of whose representations the so-called "gnostic gems" are so full. Over the seven rays of the lion's crown, and corresponding to their points, stand, in many cases, the seven vowels of the Greek alphabet AEHIOYW, testifying to the Seven Heavens. This is the Solar lion and the emblem of the Solar cycle, as Garuda is that of the great cycle, the "Maha-Kalpa" co-eternal with Vishnu, and also, of course, the emblem of the Sun, and Solar cycle. ... As well remarked by C. W. King: — "Whatever the primary meaning (of the gem with the solar lion and vowels) it was probably imported in its present shape from India, that true fountain head of gnostic iconography." (Gnostics, p. 218)&lt;ref name="Doctrine 2-564"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy |author=Helena Petrovna Blavatsky  |publisher=Theosophical Publishing Society |year= 1893 |edition=Original from Harvard University (2 volumes) |pages=vol 2, p 564–5 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the third volume of the ''Secret Doctrine'', published posthumously, Blavatsky described the "Seven Primeval Rays" as a group of celestial beings also known as "Gods" or "[[Deva (New Age)|Angels]]" or "Powers". She stated that this symbolism was "adopted later on by the Christian Religion as the 'Seven [[Angel of the Presence|Angels of the Presence]].'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Occultism Of The Secret Doctrine  |author=Helena Petrovna Blavatsky  |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |year= 2004 |edition=originally published in 1897 |isbn= 1-4179-1104-2 |page=art I, page 369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Theosophy, the seven rays are said to be seven major types of ''Light-Substance'' (spirit/matter) (waves/particles) that compose the created universes. These are also believed to convey "Divine Qualities".&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Reed. [http://www.blavatsky.net/confirm/ev/other/photon.htm ''Blavatsky' Foreknowledge of The Wave/Particle Duality of Light''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927044457/http://blavatsky.net/confirm/ev/other/photon.htm |date=2006-09-27 }} 1997. "It would also be incorrect to claim light is fully explained as a particle. Rather it has a dual nature possessing the properties of both [[wave]] and [[Elementary particle|particle]]. In general, [[electromagnetic radiation]] acts more like waves in the [[radio wave]] end of the [[spectrum]], more like particles in the [[x-ray]] end of the spectrum, and usually (but not always) like a wave in the "middle" light area of the spectrum in our everyday experience. Her ambiguity, then, reflects a fact in nature, the wave/particle duality of nature."&lt;/ref&gt;

===C.W. Leadbeater===

[[C.W. Leadbeater]] gave a list showing the characteristic type of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] for each ray. This list indicates what he regarded as the most compatible type of magic to be performed by persons on each ray (although anyone of any ray can do any of these various types of magic).&lt;ref&gt;Leadbetter, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India: 1925--The Theosophical Publishing House. Chart on P. 229 lists Characteristic Magic of each Ray.&lt;/ref&gt;

* First ray: Magic of [[Will (philosophy)|Will]] of [[Magician (paranormal)|magician]]
* Second ray: Magic of [[Raja Yoga]] (Development of Mind)
* Third ray: Magic of [[Astrology]] (Natural Magnetic Forces)
* Fourth ray: Magic of [[Hatha yoga|Hatha Yoga]] (physical development)
* Fifth ray: Magic of [[Alchemy]] (Manipulation of Material Substances)
* Sixth ray: Magic of [[Bhakti yoga|Bhakti Yoga]] (Selfless Service and Altruistic Love; [[agape]])
* Seventh ray: [[Ceremonial magic]] (Invocation of Elementals, and [[Deva (New Age)|Devas]])

==New Age teachings==

According to [[Alice A. Bailey]], each person has a ''soul ray'' that remains the same through all their incarnations, and a ''personality ray'' that is different for each incarnation. Each ray is also correspondent with certain Masters of Wisdom, and with particular planets, cycles, nations, etc. The seven rays are the basis for what Alice A. Bailey called ''New Age Psychology''—she divides everyone in the human race into these seven [[psychological type]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Seven Rays of Life'' New York: 1995—Lucis Publishing Co. Compilation from all the [[Alice A. Bailey]] books of material about the seven rays.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey stated that the seven rays that reach us on [[Earth]] locally originate within the "Solar Logos," i.e., the consciousness of the "Divine Being" of the [[Sun]]. According to Alice A. Bailey and [[Benjamin Creme]], the seven rays are focused to the Solar Logos, through [[Sirius]], the seven stars of the [[Big Dipper]] in the [[Ursa Major|Great Bear]], and the seven major stars of the [[Pleiades]] form the "Galactic Logos," (the consciousness of the "Divine Being" of the [[Milky Way Galaxy]]), and have their ultimate origin within the mind of [[God]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

On the local planetary level, it is believed that the seven rays are transmitted from the Solar Logos through the God of our planet, [[Sanat Kumara]], then through the spiritual hierarchy of our planet which includes the "Masters of Wisdom" &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;(Some writings term them the [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]] or the [[Great White Brotherhood]]).

Each of the seven rays is believed to be associated with a different kind of [[Magic (paranormal)|occult energy]], and a different [[color]].

===Qualities of the seven rays===
The ''seven rays'' are listed below:

[[Alice A. Bailey]] and the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] assign different colors and in some cases different Masters to each of the seven rays. In ''Letters on Occult Meditation'', Alice Bailey indicates that there is no simple correspondence between the rays and these colors. The colors, Masters, and Retreats indicated here are those indicated by both Alice Bailey and the Church Universal and Triumphant.

According to Alice A. Bailey the Masters live in immortal bodies at a ''residence'' on the [[physical plane]] at the indicated location (although a given Master may physically travel extensively incognito to various locations, become [[Invisibility|invisible]], [[Teleportation in theology|teleport]] to various locations, and walk through walls, as well as influence humans [[telepathy|telepathically]] and travel on the [[Plane (metaphysics)|inner planes]], as required by the demands of his spiritual work).

According to the Church Universal and Triumphant, and other ''[[Ascended Master Teachings|Ascended Master Activities]]'', each Master is believed to serve at a ''Retreat'' on the physical or [[etheric plane]] at the geographical location shown after their name.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Prophet, Elizabeth Clare (Compiled and edited by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana: 2003 Summit University Press "The Retreats of the Ascended Masters" Pages 395-492&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Gifts of the Holy Spirit" of the Church Universal and Triumphant for each ray are shown. For both Alice A. Bailey and the Church Universal and Triumphant, each ray has a [[Gemstone|jewel]] which is believed to focus the energy of that ray, which is indicated.

In the mid-to-late 20th century, as the [[New Age]] movement gained in popularity, the concept and imagery of the seven rays appeared in a variety of settings.

In [[esoteric astrology]], the seven rays are considered to be split into three groups: the first two rays represent Will and Wisdom, respectively, and the remaining five rays together form the group that represents Activity.&lt;ref name="Leo" /&gt; In a style of Reiki adapted by Carolyn E. Jackson the student passes through a sequence of levels by mastering the "key" to each level. The key for the second level is known as the key of "oneness" and is attained by passing through each of the seven rays.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt; This, however, is not part of traditional [[Reiki]] or other versions of the Reiki system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascensionreiki.com/Usui%20Reiki%20Manual.pdf The Usui Reiki Ryoho Gakkai Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Reiki Sourcebook |author=Bronwen &amp; Frans Steine|publisher=O Books |year= 2003|isbn= 1-903816-55-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[psychic]] counselor Samantha Stevens, an individual can use [[affirmative prayer|affirmations]], candles, [[Chromotherapy|color therapy]], vibrational medicines and other methods to contact "archangels," which she defines as the "seven rays," based on Buddhist and Christian theories: "The Rays or Divine Flames (as they are sometimes called) represent elements in the perfectly integrated human being - one whose heart is aligned with their will and inspired by the Divine Imagination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Seven Rays: A Universal Guide to the Archangels |author=Samantha Stevens |publisher=Insomniac Press |year= 2003|isbn= 1-894663-49-7 |page=22 et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Light therapy|Light therapist]] and [[Radionics]] Practitioner Primrose Cooper writes that in using light as a healing modality, she finds it helpful to use the seven rays as defined in Theosophy to assist her clients in finding "psychological insight into their soul's purpose."&lt;ref name="Cooper"/&gt;

In recent years, there was the creation of a secretive group named "The Keepers of the Seven Rays". Their philosophy is the human being has seven emanations in which it finds itself, or connects with the Higher Self. These emanations are extensions of the Higher Self or otherwise called the Higher Will. These emanations reach out like arms and grasp onto the knowledge(of all types) needed for the full development of the individual into his/her Higher Potential. All a human has to do to use these emanations is to know basic moral law, what their body and/or psyche can and cannot handle, and listen.

Metaphysical philosopher Gurdjieff writes frequently of his "Seven Rays of Creation".   According to Gurdjieff, the Seven Rays of Creation are the seven manifestations of Energy in our Universe. The first Ray contains all things (THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE) and all things obey the laws inherent in the First Ray. The First Ray then manifests itself in the 2nd Realm, the realm of Galaxies. From Galaxies to Solar Systems, Solar Systems to Planets. From Planets to Organisms on the planets, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurdjieff-legacy.org/ Gurdjieff Legacy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
;Music
* The [[progressive rock]] band [[Utopia (American band)|Utopia]] performed a song entitled "The Seven Rays." The lyrics of the song center around the philosophies associated with the seven rays concepts popular with the new age movement, with much focus on the colors associated with each ray.
* Another progressive rock band, [[Hawkwind]], have a song about the seven rays titled ''Seven by Seven''.
* [[Mike Pinder]] of [[The Moody Blues]] refers heavily to the "seven rays" and the "Light of Seven" in his solo album "The Promise".
* The pop band [[Erasure]] refers to the Violet Flame through the title of their 2014 album, ''[[The Violet Flame]]''.

In 2008, the punk rock singer and dissident [[Gorki Águila]] was arrested by police on a charge of social dangerousness. He was eventually ordered to pay a $30 fine for the lesser offence of public disorder, after prosecutors dropped the charge of social dangerousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2007, political protester Ramón Velásquez was arrested for the charge of social dangerousness. Velásquez was participating in a march across Cuba that highlighted human rights violations and freedom for political prisoners. Velásquez was then tried in a closed hearing and sentenced to three years in prison. Velásquez was released in January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/02/27/imprisoned-dangerousness-cuba|title=Imprisoned for 'Dangerousness' in Cuba|date=2010-02-27|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3567">'''Source reduction''' is activities designed to reduce the volume, mass, or toxicity of products throughout the life cycle.  It includes the design and manufacture, use, and disposal of products with minimum toxic content, minimum volume of material, and/or a longer useful life. 

An example of source reduction is use of a [[Reusable shopping bag]] at the grocery store;  although it uses more material than a single-use [[disposable]] bag, the material per use is less. 

== Synonyms ==
[[Pollution Prevention]] (or P2) and [[Toxics use reduction]] are also called source reduction because they address the use of hazardous substances at the source.

== Procedures ==
Source Reduction is achieved through improvements in design, production, use, reuse, recycling, and through Environmentally Preferable Purchasing (EPP).  A [[Life-cycle assessment]] is useful to help choose among several alternatives and options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Zabaniotou|first=A|authorlink= |author2=Kassidi  |date=August 2003 |title= Life cycle assessment applied to egg packaging made from polystyrene and recycled paper |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=549–559 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi= 10.1016/S0959-6526(02)00076-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Source reduction in the United States==
In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Trade Commission]] offers guidance for labelling claims: "Source reduction" refers to reducing or lowering the weight, volume or toxicity of a product or package. To avoid being misleading, source reduction claims must qualify the amount of the source reduction and give the basis for any comparison that is made. These principles apply regardless of whether a term like "source reduced" is used.

The [[Massachusetts]] Toxics Use Reduction Program (TURA) offers 6 strategies to achieve source reduction:{{fact|date=June 2015}}
# Toxic chemical substitution
# Production process modification
# Finished product reformulation
# Production [[modernization]]
# Improvements in operations and maintenance
# In-process recycling of production material

'''Spatial reconnaissance''', or "space reconnaissance", is the [[reconnaissance]] of any celestial bodies in space by use of spacecraft and [[satellite photography]].  NASA personnel utilizes space reconnaissance to scout other planets, military uses space reconnaissance by using spy satellites onto the Earth's surface.  Space reconnaissance assets provide access to all parts of the globe and use a variety of sensors to collect information responsive to virtually every intelligence need.  They also constitute an integral part of the U.S. military force structure, providing critical information with sufficient accuracy and timeliness to support the maneuver of military forces and the targeting of their weapons.

Space reconnaissance is also very expensive. Although procured in limited numbers, the large satellite systems developed by the United States and the ground stations needed to operate them require expenditures in the range of several billions of dollars per year.  Their substantial cost puts great pressure on the Intelligence Community to search for alternatives, find efficiencies, and continuously scrutinize the intelligence requirements these systems address.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20290">{{Polymorphism}}
In [[programming language theory]], '''subtyping''' (also '''subtype polymorphism''' or '''inclusion polymorphism''') is a form of [[Polymorphism (computer science)|type polymorphism]] in which a '''subtype''' is a [[datatype]] that is related to another datatype (the '''supertype''') by some notion of [[Liskov substitution principle|substitutability]], meaning that program elements, typically [[subroutines]] or functions, written to operate on elements of the supertype can also operate on elements of the subtype. If S is a subtype of T, the subtyping [[binary relation|relation]] is often written S &lt;: T, to mean that any term of type S can be ''safely used in a context where'' a term of type T is expected. The precise semantics of subtyping crucially depends on the particulars of what "safely used in a context where" means in a given [[programming language]]. The [[type system]] of a programming language essentially defines its own subtyping relation, which may well be [[identity relation|trivial]] should the language support no (or very little) conversion mechanisms.

Due to the subtyping relation, a term may belong to more than one type. Subtyping is therefore a form of type polymorphism. In [[object-oriented programming]] the term 'polymorphism' is commonly used to refer solely to this ''subtype polymorphism'', while the techniques of [[parametric polymorphism]] would be considered ''[[generic programming]]''.

[[Functional programming languages]] often allow the subtyping of [[Record (computer science)|records]]. Consequently, [[simply typed lambda calculus]] extended with record types is perhaps the simplest theoretical setting in which a useful notion of subtyping may be defined and studied {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Because the resulting calculus allows terms to have more than one type, it is no longer a "simple" [[type theory]]. Since functional programming languages, by definition, support [[function literals]], which can also be stored in records, records types with subtyping provide some of the features of object-oriented programming. Typically, functional programming languages also provide some, usually restricted, form of parametric polymorphism. In a theoretical setting, it is desirable to study the interaction of the two features; a common theoretical setting is [[system F-sub|system F&lt;sub&gt;&lt;:&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Various calculi that attempt to capture the theoretical properties of object-oriented programming may be derived from system F&lt;sub&gt;&lt;:&lt;/sub&gt;.

The concept of subtyping is related to the linguistic notions of [[hyponymy]] and [[holonymy]]. It is also related to the concept of [[bounded quantification]] in mathematical logic. Subtyping should not be confused with the notion of (class or object) [[inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]] from object-oriented languages;{{sfn|Cook|Hill|Canning|1990}} subtyping is a relation between types (interfaces in object-oriented parlance) whereas inheritance is a relation between implementations stemming from a language feature that allows new objects to be created from existing ones. In a number of object-oriented languages, subtyping is called '''interface inheritance''',&lt;!-- todo add the insightful example from Mitchell with stack/queue/dequeue in the body --&gt; with inheritance referred to as ''implementation inheritance''.

== Origins ==
The notion of subtyping in programming languages dates back to the 1960s; it was introduced in [[Simula]] derivatives. The first formal treatments of subtyping were given by [[John C. Reynolds]] in 1980 who used [[category theory]] to formalize [[implicit conversion]]s, and [[Luca Cardelli]] (1985).&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, ch. 15 notes&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of subtyping has gained visibility (and synonymy with polymorphism in some circles) with the mainstream adoption of object-oriented programming. In this context, the principle of safe substitution is often called the [[Liskov substitution principle]], after [[Barbara Liskov]] who popularized it in a [[keynote]] address at a conference on object-oriented programming in 1987. Because it must consider mutable objects, the ideal notion of subtyping defined by Liskov and [[Jeannette Wing]], called [[behavioral subtyping]] is considerably stronger than what can be implemented in a [[type checker]]. (See [[#Function types|Function types]] below for details.)

== Examples ==
[[Image:Inheritance.svg|thumb|right|350px|Example of subtypes: where bird is the supertype and all others are subtypes as denoted by the arrow in [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] notation]]
A simple practical example of subtypes is shown in the diagram, right. The type "bird" has three subtypes "duck", "cuckoo" and "ostrich". Conceptually, each of these is a variety of the basic "bird" that inherits many "bird" characteristics but has some specific differences. The [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] notation is used in this diagram, with open-headed arrows showing the direction and type of the relationship between the supertype and its subtypes.

As a more practical example, a language might allow integer values to be used wherever floating point values are expected (&lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; &lt;: &lt;code&gt;Float&lt;/code&gt;), or it might define a generic type &lt;samp&gt;Number&lt;/samp&gt; as a common supertype of integers and the reals. In this second case, we only have &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; &lt;: &lt;code&gt;Number&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Float&lt;/code&gt; &lt;: &lt;code&gt;Number&lt;/code&gt;, but &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Float&lt;/code&gt; are not subtypes of each other.

Programmers may take advantage of subtyping [[abstraction principle (programming)|to write code in a more abstract manner]] than would be possible without it. Consider the following example:

&lt;source lang="vb"&gt;
function max (x as Number, y as Number) is
  if x &lt; y then
    return y
  else
    return x
end
&lt;/source&gt;

If integer and real are both subtypes of &lt;code&gt;Number&lt;/code&gt;, and an operator of comparison with an arbitrary Number is defined for both types, then values of either type can be passed to this function. However, the very possibility of implementing such an operator highly constrains the Number type (for example, one can't compare an integer with a complex number), and actually only comparing integers with integers and reals with reals makes sense. Rewriting this function so that it would only accept 'x' and 'y' of the same type requires [[bounded polymorphism]].

Subtyping in type theory is characterized by the fact that any expression of type ''A'' may also be given type ''B'' if ''A''&lt;samp&gt;&amp;lt;:&lt;/samp&gt;''B''; the formal [[inference rule|typing rule]] that codifies this is known as the ''subsumption'' rule.&lt;!-- this needs context as it's not a generic notion. --&gt;

== Subtyping schemes ==

Type theorists make a distinction between '''[[nominal type system|nominal subtyping]]''', in which only types declared in a certain way may be subtypes of each other, and '''[[structural type system|structural subtyping]]''', in which the structure of two types determines whether or not one is a subtype of the other.  The class-based object-oriented subtyping described above is nominal; a structural subtyping rule for an object-oriented language might say that if objects of type ''A'' can handle all of the messages that objects of type ''B'' can handle (that is, if they define all the same [[Method (computer science)|method]]s), then ''A'' is a subtype of ''B'' regardless of whether either [[inheritance (computer science)|inherits]] from the other. This so-called ''[[duck typing]]'' is common in dynamically typed object-oriented languages. Sound structural subtyping rules for types other than object types are also well known.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Implementations of programming languages with subtyping fall into two general classes: ''inclusive'' implementations, in which the representation of any value of type ''A'' also represents the same value at type ''B'' if ''A''&lt;samp&gt;&amp;lt;:&lt;/samp&gt;''B'', and ''coercive'' implementations, in which a value of type ''A'' can be ''automatically converted'' into one of type ''B''. The subtyping induced by subclassing in an object-oriented language is usually inclusive; subtyping relations that relate integers and floating-point numbers, which are represented differently, are usually coercive.

In almost all type systems that define a subtyping relation, it is reflexive (meaning ''A''&lt;samp&gt;&amp;lt;:&lt;/samp&gt;''A'' for any type ''A'') and transitive (meaning that if ''A''&lt;samp&gt;&amp;lt;:&lt;/samp&gt;''B'' and ''B''&lt;samp&gt;&amp;lt;:&lt;/samp&gt;''C'' then ''A''&lt;samp&gt;&amp;lt;:&lt;/samp&gt;''C''). This makes it a [[preorder]] on types.

== Record types ==

=== Width and depth subtyping ===

Types of [[Record (computer science)|records]] give rise to the concepts of ''width'' and ''depth'' subtyping. These express two different ways of obtaining a new type of record that allows the same operations as the original record type.

Recall that a record is a collection of (named) fields. Since a subtype is a type which allows all operations allowed on the original type, a record subtype should support the same operations on the fields as the original type supported.

One kind of way to achieve such support, called ''width subtyping'', adds more fields to the record. More formally, every (named) field appearing in the width supertype will appear in the width subtype. Thus, any operation feasible on the supertype will be supported by the subtype.

The second method, called ''depth subtyping'', replaces the various fields with their subtypes. That is, the fields of the subtype are subtypes of the fields of the supertype. Since any operation supported for a field in the supertype is supported for its subtype, any operation feasible on the record supertype is supported by the record subtype. Depth subtyping only makes sense for immutable records: for example, you can assign 1.5 to the 'x' field of a real point (a record with two real fields), but you can't do the same to the 'x' field of an integer point (which, however, is a deep subtype of the real point type) because 1.5 is not an integer (see [[Covariance and contravariance (computer science)|Variance]]).

Subtyping of records can be defined in [[System F-sub|System F&lt;sub&gt;&lt;:&lt;/sub&gt;]], which combines [[parametric polymorphism]] with subtyping of record types and is a theoretical basis for many [[functional programming languages]] that support both features.

Some systems also support subtyping of labeled [[disjoint union]] types (such as [[algebraic data type]]s). The rule for width subtyping is reversed: every tag appearing in the width subtype must appear in the width supertype.

==Function types==

If ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a function type, then a subtype of it is any function type ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with the property that ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;: ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;: ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This can be summarised using the following [[type rule|typing rule]]: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;math&gt;T_1 \leq: S_1 \quad S_2 \leq: T_2
\over
S_1 \rightarrow S_2 \leq: T_1 \rightarrow T_2
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The argument type of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is said to be [[Covariance and contravariance (computer science)|contravariant]] because the subtyping relation is reversed for it, whereas the return type is [[Covariance and contravariance (computer science)|covariant]]. Informally, this reversal occurs because the refined type is "more liberal" in the types it accepts and "more conservative" in the type it returns. This is what exactly works in [[Scala_(programming_language) |Scala]]: a ''n''-ary function is internally a class that inherits the '''FunctionN(-A1, -A2, …, -An, +B)''' [[Trait (computer programming) |trait]] (which can be seen as a general [[Application programming interface|interface]] in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-like languages), where ''A1'', ''A2'', … ''An'' are the parameter types, and ''B'' is its return type; "'''-'''" before the type means the type is contravariant while "'''+'''" means covariant.

In languages that allow side effects, like most object-oriented languages, subtyping is generally not sufficient to guarantee that a function can be safely used in the context of another. Liskov's work in this area focused on [[behavioral subtyping]], which besides the type system safety discussed in this article also requires that subtypes preserve all [[Invariant (computer science)|invariants]] guaranteed by the supertypes in some [[Design by Contract|contract]].&lt;ref name="LSP"&gt;Barbara Liskov, Jeannette Wing, ''[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.39.1223 A behavioral notion of subtyping]'', ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, Volume 16, Issue 6 (November 1994), pp. 1811–1841. An updated version appeared as CMU technical report: {{cite web|url=http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/1999/CMU-CS-99-156.ps|title=Behavioral Subtyping Using Invariants and Constraints|last=Liskov|first=Barbara|authorlink=Barbara Liskov|author2=Wing, Jeannette |authorlink2=Jeannette Wing |date=July 1999|format=[[PostScript|PS]]|accessdate=2006-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition of subtyping is generally [[undecidable problem|undecidable]], so it cannot be verified by a [[type checker]].

The subtyping of [[Immutable object|mutable reference]]s is similar to the treatment of function arguments and return values. Write-only references (or ''sinks'') are contravariant, like function arguments; read-only references (or ''sources'') are covariant, like return values. Mutable references which act as both sources and sinks are invariant.

==Relationship with inheritance==

Subtyping and inheritance are independent (orthogonal) relationships. They may coincide, but none is a special case of the other. In other words, between two types ''S'' and ''T'', all combinations of subtyping and inheritance are possible:
# ''S'' is neither a subtype nor a derived type of ''T''
# ''S'' is a subtype but is not a derived type of ''T''
# ''S'' is not a subtype but is a derived type of ''T''
# ''S'' is both a subtype and a derived type of ''T''
The first case is illustrated by independent types, such as &lt;code&gt;Boolean&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Float&lt;/code&gt;.

The second case can be illustrated by &lt;code&gt;Int32&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Int64&lt;/code&gt;; in most object oriented programming languages, &lt;code&gt;Int64&lt;/code&gt; is not derived by inheritance from &lt;code&gt;Int32&lt;/code&gt;, however &lt;code&gt;Int64 &lt;: Int32&lt;/code&gt;. Since an &lt;code&gt;Int32&lt;/code&gt; value can always be replaced by an &lt;code&gt;Int64&lt;/code&gt; value, the [[Liskov substitution principle]] is satisfied; therefore &lt;code&gt;Int64&lt;/code&gt; can be considered a subtype of &lt;code&gt;Int32&lt;/code&gt;.

The third case is a consequence of [[Subtyping_of_functions|function subtyping input contravariance]]. Assume a super class of type ''T'' having a method ''m'' returning an object of the same type (''i.e.'' the type of ''m'' is ''T → T'', also note that the first argument of ''m'' is this/self) and a derived class type ''S'' from ''T''. By inheritance, the type of ''m'' in ''S'' is ''S → S''. In order for ''S'' to be a subtype of ''T'' the type of ''m'' in ''S'' must be a subtype of the type of ''m'' in ''T'', in other words: ''S → S ≤: T → T''. By bottom-up application of the function subtyping rule, this means: ''S ≤: T'' and ''T ≤: S'', which is only possible if ''S'' and ''T'' are the same. Since inheritance is an irreflexive relation, ''S'' can't be a subtype of ''T''.

Subtyping and inheritance are compatible when all inherited fields and methods of the derived type have types which are subtypes of the corresponding fields and methods from the inherited type {{sfn|Cook|Hill|Canning|1990}}.

==Coercions==
In coercive subtyping systems, subtypes are defined by implicit [[type conversion]] functions from subtype to supertype. For each subtyping relationship (''S'' &lt;: ''T''), a coercion function ''coerce'': ''S'' → ''T'' is provided, and any object ''s'' of type ''S'' is regarded as the object ''coerce''&lt;sub&gt;''S'' → ''T''&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') of type ''T''. A coercion function may be defined by composition: if ''S'' &lt;: ''T'' and ''T'' &lt;: ''U'' then ''s'' may be regarded as an object of type ''u'' under the compound coercion (''coerce''&lt;sub&gt;''T'' → ''U''&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''coerce''&lt;sub&gt;''S'' → ''T''&lt;/sub&gt;). The [[type coercion]] from a type to itself ''coerce''&lt;sub&gt;''T'' → ''T''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[identity function]] ''id''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;

Coercion functions for records and [[disjoint union]] subtypes may be defined componentwise; in the case of width-extended records, type coercion simply discards any components which are not defined in the supertype. The type coercion for function types may be given by ''f'''(''s'') = ''coerce''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(''f''(''coerce''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''))), reflecting the [[Covariance and contravariance (computer science)|contravariance]] of function arguments and covariance of return values.

The coercion function is uniquely determined given the subtype and [[supertype]]. Thus, when multiple subtyping relationships are defined, one must be careful to guarantee that all type coercions are coherent. For instance, if an integer such as 2 : ''int'' can be coerced to a floating point number (say, 2.0 : ''float''), then it is not admissible to coerce 2.1 : ''float'' to 2 : ''int'', because the compound coercion ''coerce''&lt;sub&gt;''float'' → ''float''&lt;/sub&gt; given by ''coerce''&lt;sub&gt;''int'' → ''float''&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''coerce''&lt;sub&gt;''float'' → ''int''&lt;/sub&gt; would then be distinct from the identity coercion ''id''&lt;sub&gt;''float''&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''Suffering''', or '''pain''' in a broad sense,&lt;ref&gt;See '[[#Terminology|Terminology]]'. See also the entry 'Pleasure' in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pleasure/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy], which begins with this paragraph: "Pleasure, in the inclusive usages most important in moral psychology, ethical theory, and the studies of mind, includes all joy and gladness&amp;nbsp;— all our feeling good, or happy. It is often contrasted with similarly inclusive pain or suffering, which is similarly thought of as including all our feeling bad." It should be mentioned that most encyclopedias, like the one mentioned above and Britannica, do not have an article about suffering and describe pain in the physical sense only.&lt;/ref&gt; may be an experience of unpleasantness and aversion associated with the perception of [[harm]] or threat of harm in an individual.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Wayne Hudson in Historicizing Suffering, Chapter 14 of Perspectives on Human Suffering (Jeff Malpas and Norelle Lickiss, editors, Springer, 2012) : "According to the standard account suffering is a universal human experience described as a negative basic feeling or emotion that involves a subjective character of unpleasantness, aversion, harm or threat of harm to body or mind (Spelman 1997; Cassell 1991)."&lt;/ref&gt; Suffering is the basic element that makes up the negative [[valence (psychology)|valence]] of [[affective]] [[phenomena]]. The opposite of suffering is [[pleasure]] or [[happiness]].

Suffering is often categorized as physical&lt;ref&gt;Examples of physical suffering: [[pain]] of various types, excessive heat, excessive cold, [[itching]], [[hunger]], [[thirst]], [[nausea]], [[air hunger]], [[sleep deprivation]] {{cite web |url=http://www.iasp-pain.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section%3DGeneral_Resource_Links%26Template%3D%2FCM%2FHTMLDisplay.cfm%26ContentID%3D3058 |accessdate=September 11, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926205544/http://www.iasp-pain.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=General_Resource_Links&amp;Template=%2FCM%2FHTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=3058 |archivedate=September 26, 2008 |df= }}{{cite web |url=http://www.palliative.uab.edu/response/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028180547/http://www.palliative.uab.edu/response/ |archivedate=2007-10-28 |df= }}. Other examples are given by L. W. Sumner, on page 103 of [https://books.google.com/books?id=tjua97jPvEYC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=suffering+sumner+happiness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZyDU9Tqs6H&amp;sig=kgb_8YA1EFDjufwDCACs6w99ND8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=w9qbSs-3Ns-G8QaTufDCBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Welfare, Happiness, and Ethics]: "Think for a moment of the many physical symptoms which, when persistent, can make our lives miserable: nausea, hiccups, sneezing, dizziness, disorientation, loss of balance, itching, 'pins and needles', 'restless legs', tics, twitching, fatigue, difficulty in breathing, and so on."&lt;/ref&gt; or mental.&lt;ref&gt;Mental suffering can also be called psychological or emotional (see [[Psychological pain]]). Examples of mental suffering: [[depression (mood)]] / [[hopelessness]], [[grief]], [[sadness]] / [[loneliness]] / [[Broken heart|heartbreak]], [[disgust]], [[irritation]], [[anger]], [[jealousy]], [[envy]], [[tanha|craving or yearning]], [[frustration]], [[anguish]], [[angst]], [[fear]], [[anxiety]] / [[panic]], [[shame]] / [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[regret (emotion)|regret]], [[embarrassment]] / [[humiliation]], [[Psychomotor agitation|restlessness]].&lt;/ref&gt; It may come in all degrees of intensity, from mild to intolerable. Factors of duration and frequency of occurrence usually compound that of intensity. Attitudes toward suffering may vary widely, in the sufferer or other people, according to how much it is regarded as avoidable or unavoidable, useful or useless, deserved or undeserved.

Suffering occurs in the lives of [[Sentience|sentient]] beings in numerous manners, often dramatically. As a result, many fields of human activity are concerned with some aspects of suffering. These aspects may include the nature of suffering, its processes, its origin and causes, its meaning and significance, its related personal, social, and cultural behaviors, its remedies, management, and uses.

==Terminology==
The word ''suffering'' is sometimes used in the narrow sense of [[pain|physical pain]], but more often it refers to [[psychological pain|mental pain]], or more often yet it refers to pain in the broad sense, i.e. to any unpleasant [[feeling]], [[emotion]] or [[perception|sensation]]. The word ''pain'' usually refers to physical pain, but it is also a common synonym of ''suffering''. The words ''pain'' and ''suffering'' are often used both together in different ways. For instance, they may be used as interchangeable synonyms. Or they may be used in 'contradistinction' to one another, as in "pain is physical, suffering is mental", or "pain is inevitable, suffering is optional". Or they may be used to define each other, as in "pain is physical suffering", or "suffering is severe physical or mental pain".

Qualifiers, such as ''physical'', ''mental'', ''emotional'', and ''psychological'', are often used to refer to certain types of pain or suffering. In particular, ''mental pain (or suffering)'' may be used in relationship with ''physical pain (or suffering)'' for distinguishing between two wide categories of pain or suffering. A first caveat concerning such a distinction is that it uses ''physical pain'' in a sense that normally includes not only the 'typical sensory experience of physical pain' but also other unpleasant bodily experiences including [[dyspnea|air hunger]], [[hunger]], [[vestibular system|vestibular suffering]], [[nausea]], [[sleep deprivation]], and [[itch]]ing. A second caveat is that the terms ''physical'' or ''mental'' should not be taken too literally: physical pain or suffering, as a matter of fact, happens through conscious minds and involves emotional aspects, while mental pain or suffering happens through physical brains and, being an emotion, involves important physiological aspects.

The word ''unpleasantness'', which some people use as a synonym of ''suffering'' or ''pain'' in the broad sense, may be used to refer to the basic affective dimension of pain (its suffering aspect), usually in contrast with the sensory dimension, as for instance in this sentence: "Pain-unpleasantness is often, though not always, closely linked to both the intensity and unique qualities of the painful sensation."&lt;ref&gt;Donald D. Price, [http://molinterv.aspetjournals.org/cgi/content/full/2/6/392 Central Neural Mechanisms that Interrelate Sensory and Affective Dimensions of Pain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818004239/http://molinterv.aspetjournals.org/cgi/content/full/2/6/392 |date=2009-08-18 }}, ‘’Molecular Interventions’’ 2:392-403 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Other current words that have a definition with some similarity to ''suffering'' include ''distress, unhappiness, misery, affliction, woe, ill, discomfort, displeasure, disagreeableness''.

==Philosophy==
{{Hedonism}}
[[Hedonism]], as an ethical theory, claims that good and bad consist ultimately in [[pleasure]] and pain. Many hedonists, in accordance with [[Epicurus]] and contrarily to popular perception of his doctrine, advocate that we should first seek to avoid suffering and that the greatest pleasure lies in a robust state of profound tranquility ([[ataraxia]]) that is free from the worrisome pursuit or the unwelcome consequences of ephemeral pleasures.

For [[Stoicism]], the greatest good lies in reason and virtue, but the soul best reaches it through a kind of indifference ([[apathy|apatheia]]) to pleasure and pain: as a consequence, this doctrine has become identified with stern self-control in regard to suffering.

{{Utilitarianism}}
[[Jeremy Bentham]] developed hedonistic [[utilitarianism]], a popular doctrine in ethics, politics, and economics. Bentham argued that the right act or policy was that which would cause "the greatest happiness of the greatest number". He suggested a procedure called [[felicific calculus|hedonic or felicific calculus]], for determining how much pleasure and pain would result from any action. [[John Stuart Mill]] improved and promoted the doctrine of hedonistic utilitarianism. [[Karl Popper]], in ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', proposed a [[negative utilitarianism]], which prioritizes the reduction of suffering over the enhancement of happiness when speaking of utility: "I believe that there is, from the ethical point of view, no symmetry between suffering and happiness, or between pain and pleasure. (...) human suffering makes a direct moral appeal for help, while there is no similar call to increase the happiness of a man who is doing well anyway." [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]], for his part, advocates a utilitarianism that aims straightforwardly at the abolition of suffering through the use of biotechnology (see more details below in section [[Suffering#Biology, neurology, psychology|Biology, neurology, psychology]]). Another aspect worthy of mention here is that many utilitarians since Bentham hold that the moral status of a being comes from its ability to feel pleasure and pain: therefore, moral agents should consider not only the interests of human beings but also those of (other) animals. [[Richard D. Ryder|Richard Ryder]] came to the same conclusion in his concepts of 'speciesism' and 'painism'. [[Peter Singer]]'s writings, especially the book [[Animal Liberation (book)|''Animal Liberation'']], represent the leading edge of this kind of utilitarianism for animals as well as for people.

Another doctrine related to the relief of suffering is [[humanitarianism]] (see also [[humanitarian principles]], [[humanitarian aid]], and [[humane society]]). "Where humanitarian efforts seek a positive addition to the happiness of sentient beings, it is to make the unhappy happy rather than the happy happier. (...) [Humanitarianism] is an ingredient in many social attitudes; in the modern world it has so penetrated into diverse movements (...) that it can hardly be said to exist in itself."&lt;ref&gt;Crane Brinton, article ''Humanitarianism'', Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pessimism|Pessimists]] hold this world to be mainly bad, or even the worst possible, plagued with, among other things, unbearable and unstoppable suffering. Some identify suffering as the nature of the world, and conclude that it would be better if life did not exist at all. [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] recommends us to take refuge in things like art, philosophy, loss of the [[will to live]], and tolerance toward 'fellow-sufferers'.

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]],  first influenced by Schopenhauer, developed afterward quite another attitude, arguing that the suffering of life is productive, exalting the [[will to power]], despising weak compassion or pity, and recommending us to embrace willfully the '[[Ewige Wiederkunft|eternal return]]' of the greatest sufferings. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

[[Pain (philosophy)|Philosophy of pain]] is a philosophical specialty that focuses on physical [[pain]] and is, through that, relevant to suffering in general.

==Religion==

Suffering plays an important role in a number of religions, regarding matters such as the following: consolation or relief; moral conduct (do no harm, help the afflicted, show [[compassion]]); spiritual advancement through life hardships or through self-imposed trials ([[mortification of the flesh]], [[penance]], [[ascetism]]); ultimate destiny ([[salvation]], [[damnation]], [[hell]]). [[Theodicy]] deals with the [[problem of evil]], which is the difficulty of reconciling the existence of an omnipotent and benevolent god with the existence of evil: a quintessential form of evil, for many people, is extreme suffering, especially in innocent children, or in creatures destined to an eternity of torments (see [[problem of hell]]).

The '[[Four Noble Truths]]' of [[Buddhism]] are about [[dukkha]], a term often translated as suffering. They state the nature of suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation, the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. Buddhism considers liberation from ''dukkha'' and the practice of compassion ([[Karuṇā|karuna]]) as basic for leading a holy life and attaining [[nirvana]].

Hinduism holds that suffering follows naturally from personal negative behaviors in one’s current life or in a past life (see [[karma in Hinduism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kane, P.V. History of the Dharmaśāstras Vol. 4 p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; One must accept suffering as a just consequence and as an opportunity for spiritual progress. Thus the soul or true self, which is eternally free of any suffering, may come to manifest itself in the person, who then achieves liberation ([[moksha]]). Abstinence from causing pain or harm to other beings ([[ahimsa]]) is a central tenet of Hinduism.  Suffering is thought to be an inclusive effect of human experience.  Beyond this, Hindus are looking to achieve enlightenment and end human suffering by answering questions about life.  This will lead to a unity in God as well as find the meaning of their suffering, ultimately achieving bliss.

Christianity also believes that human suffering plays an important role in religion. Suffering is only to be thought of as a positive experience in the case of achieving a higher meaning of life, such as Jesus suffering for the lives of other people as was the case during the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]].  Suffering is the time to find God and value faith while doing so.  This allows Christians to face reality of human experience with suffering and find an understanding in the divine.

Hinduism and Christianity embrace similar aspects in suffering.  Both religions realize the need for God as well as the moral significance for God that suffering provides.  This allows enlightenment to be reached and suffering to be seen in the conditions that faith entails rather than an issue.  These human experiences with suffering in both Hinduism and Christianity help educators to emphasize the need for dialogue and religious education in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baring|first1=Rito|title=Analyzing Empirical Notions of Suffering:  Advancing Youth Dialogue and Education|journal=Religious Education|date=March 1, 2010|volume=105|issue=02|pages=157–172|doi=10.1080/00344081003645145|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.authenticate.library.duq.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=8&amp;sid=ce11b5d1-a752-4828-83cc-4cd82bd06fa5%40sessionmgr110&amp;hid=112|accessdate=30 September 2014}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islam]], the faithful must endure suffering with hope and faith, not resist or ask why, accept it as Allah's will and submit to it as a test of faith (Allah never asks more than can be endured). One must also work to alleviate suffering of others, as well as one's own. Suffering is also seen as a blessing in Islam for the mankind . Through the gift of suffering  the Veil of Forgetfulness is torn apart and the sufferer remembers God and connects with him. When people suffer God makes them think of him. Several Islamic Prophet Muhammad's traditions state that, suffering expunges the sins of mankind and cleanses their soul for the immense reward in afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Suffering an Islamic point of view:{{cite web |url=https://seekingthedivinecountenance.wordpress.com/2015/03/14/sufferings-are-divine-grace/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001153423/https://seekingthedivinecountenance.wordpress.com/2015/03/14/sufferings-are-divine-grace/ |archivedate=2016-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible's [[Book of Job]] reflects on the nature and meaning of suffering. It is supplemented in the Hebrew bible by the passages found in the Book of Isaiah and the Book of Jeremiah which elaborate the emotional and physical suffering of a conquered nation with its vanquished inhabitants forced into the suffering of exile and captivity in a foreign land.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah, Chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the New Testament, suffering is portrayed both in the life of Jesus portrayed in the Synoptics, which narrate the suffering of the crucifixion, and in the post-Easter narratives. The suffering associated with punishment is further portrayed in the Apocalypse of John where suffering at the scene of the Last Judgment is depicted as the just recompense for sin and wrongdoing. Pope John Paul II wrote "On the Christian Meaning of Human Suffering".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_11021984_salvifici-doloris_en.html On the Christian Meaning of Human Suffering] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050930062256/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_11021984_salvifici-doloris_en.html |date=September 30, 2005 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; This meaning revolves around the notion of [[redemptive suffering]].

According to the [[Bahá'í Faith]], all suffering is a brief and temporary manifestation of physical life, whose source is the material aspects of physical existence, and often attachment to them, whereas only joy exists in the spiritual worlds. In the words of [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], "''All these examples are to show you that the trials which beset our every step, all our sorrow, pain, shame and grief, are born in the world of matter; whereas the spiritual Kingdom never causes sadness. A man living with his thoughts in this Kingdom knows perpetual joy. The ills all flesh is heir to do not pass him by, but they only touch the surface of his life, the depths are calm and serene.''" ([[Paris Talks]], p.&amp;nbsp;110).

==Arts and literature==

Artistic and literary works often engage with suffering, sometimes at great cost to their creators or performers. The [http://litmed.med.nyu.edu/Keyword?action=listann&amp;id=54 Literature, Arts, and Medicine Database] offers a list of such works under the categories art, film, literature, and theater. Be it in the tragic, comic or other genres, art and literature offer means to alleviate (and perhaps also exacerbate) suffering, as argued for instance in Harold Schweizer's ''Suffering and the remedy of art''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schweizer, Harold |title=Suffering and the remedy of art |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany, N.Y |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=0-7914-3264-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bruegel, Pieter de Oude - De val van icarus - hi res.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]''&lt;/center&gt; by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]]]]

This Brueghel painting is among those that inspired W. H. Auden's poem [[Musée des Beaux Arts (poem)|Musée des Beaux Arts]] :

''About suffering they were never wrong,'' &lt;br&gt;
''The Old Masters; how well, they understood'' &lt;br&gt;
''Its human position; how it takes place'' &lt;br&gt;
''While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along;''&lt;br&gt;
''(...)''&lt;br&gt;
''In Breughel's Icarus, for instance: how everything turns away'' &lt;br&gt;
''Quite leisurely from the disaster; (...)''
&lt;ref&gt;W.H. Auden, ''Musée des Beaux Arts'' (1938) in ''Collected Poems'' p. 179 (E. Mendelson ed. 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social sciences==

''Social suffering'', according to [[Arthur Kleinman]] and others, describes "collective and individual human suffering associated with life conditions shaped by powerful social forces".&lt;ref&gt;Social suffering. Daedalus. Proc Amer Acad Arts Sciences 1996;125(1).&lt;/ref&gt; Such suffering is an increasing concern in medical anthropology, ethnography, mass media analysis, and Holocaust studies, says Iain Wilkinson,&lt;ref&gt;Iain Wilkinson, ''Suffering&amp;nbsp;– A Sociological Introduction'', Polity Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; who is developing a sociology of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kent.ac.uk/sspssr/staff/academic/wilkinson.html |title=School of Social Policy, Sociology and Social Research|accessdate=July 31, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014817/http://www.kent.ac.uk/sspssr/staff/academic/wilkinson.html |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential]]'' is a work by the [[Union of International Associations]]. Its main databases are about world problems (56,564 profiles), global strategies and solutions (32,547 profiles), human values (3,257 profiles), and human development (4,817 profiles). It states that "the most fundamental entry common to the core parts is that of pain (or suffering)" and "common to the core parts is the learning dimension of new understanding or insight in response to suffering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=26 |title=Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – commentaries &amp;#124; Union of International Associations (UIA) |publisher=Uia.be |date= |accessdate=2013-01-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717235705/http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=26 |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In economics, the following notions relate not only to the matters suggested by their positive appellations, but to the matter of suffering as well: [[Quality of life|Well-being or Quality of life]], [[Welfare economics]], [[Happiness economics]], [[Gross National Happiness]], [[Genuine Progress Indicator]].

In law, "[[Pain and suffering]]" is a legal term that refers to the mental distress or physical pain endured by a plaintiff as a result of injury for which the plaintiff seeks redress. Assessments of pain and suffering are required to be made for attributing legal awards.

==Biology, neurology, psychology==

Suffering and [[pleasure]] are respectively the negative and positive affects, or hedonic tones, or [[valence (psychology)|valences]] that psychologists often identify as basic in our emotional lives.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanna Colombetti, [http://polorovereto.unitn.it/~colombetti/docs/GC_AppraisingValence05.pdf Appraising Valence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925233238/http://polorovereto.unitn.it/~colombetti/docs/GC_AppraisingValence05.pdf |date=September 25, 2007 }}, Journal of Consciousness Studies 12 (8-10), pp. 106–129 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary role of physical and mental suffering, through natural selection, is primordial: it [[warning system|warns]] of threats, motivates [[coping (psychology)|coping]] ([[fight-or-flight response|fight or flight]], [[escapism]]), and [[reinforce]]s negatively certain behaviors (see [[punishment (psychology)|punishment]], [[aversives]]). Despite its initial disrupting nature, suffering contributes to the organization of meaning in an individual's world and psyche. In turn, meaning determines how individuals or societies experience and deal with suffering.

[[Image:MRI Head 5 slices.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Neuroimaging sheds light on the seat of suffering&lt;/center&gt;]]

Many brain structures and physiological processes are involved in suffering. Various hypotheses try to account for the experience of suffering. One of these, the ''pain overlap theory''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webscript.princeton.edu/~psych/psychology/related/socneuconf/pdf/eisenberger-lieberman2.pdf |title=Pain Overlap Theory |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229045200/http://webscript.princeton.edu/%7Epsych/psychology/related/socneuconf/pdf/eisenberger-lieberman2.pdf |archivedate=February 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; takes note, thanks to neuroimaging studies, that the [[cingulate cortex]] fires up when the brain feels suffering from experimentally induced social distress '''or''' physical pain as well. The theory proposes therefore that physical pain and social pain (i.e. two radically differing kinds of suffering) share a common phenomenological and neurological basis.

According to [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]]’s online manifesto [[The Hedonistic Imperative]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/tabconhi.htm The Hedonistic Imperative: Table Of Contents&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6IEC1EPkK?url=http://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/tabconhi.htm |date=2013-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suffering is the avoidable result of Darwinian genetic design. Pearce promotes replacing the pain/pleasure axis with a robot-like response to noxious stimuli&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/vanity-fair.html Vanity Fair interview with Pearce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505015831/http://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/vanity-fair.html |date=2007-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or with gradients of bliss,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.gradients.com/ Life in the Far North - An information-theoretic perspective on Heaven] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314162929/http://www.gradients.com/ |date=2016-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; through [[genetic engineering]] and other technical scientific advances.

Hedonistic psychology,&lt;ref&gt;Kahneman, D., E. Diener and N. Schwartz (eds.) ''Well-being: The Foundations of Hedonistic Psychology'', Russell Sage Foundation, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; [[affective science]], and [[affective neuroscience]] are some of the emerging scientific fields that could in the coming years focus their attention on the phenomenon of suffering.

==Health care==
Disease and injury may contribute to suffering in humans and animals. For example, suffering may be a feature of mental or physical illness such as [[borderline personality disorder]]&lt;ref name=PM&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fertuck|first1=EA.|last2=Jekal|first2=A.|last3=Song|first3=I.|last4=Wyman|first4=B.|last5=Morris|first5=MC.|last6=Wilson|first6=ST.|last7=Brodsky|first7=BS.|last8=Stanley|first8=B.|title=Enhanced ‘Reading the Mind in the Eyes’ in borderline personality disorder compared to healthy controls|journal=Psychological Medicine|date=December 2009|volume=39|issue=12|pages=1979–1988|doi=10.1017/S003329170900600X|pmc=3427787|pmid=19460187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DSM-IV&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)|date=1994|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-89-042061-4|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occasionally in [[Cancer|advanced cancer]].&lt;ref name="Wilson et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=KG.|last2=Chochinov|first2=HM.|last3=McPherson|first3=CJ.|last4=LeMay|first4=K.|last5=Allard|first5=P.|last6=Chary|first6=S.|last7=Gagnon|first7=PR.|last8=Macmillan|first8=K.|last9=De Luca|first9=M.|last10=O'Shea|first10=F.|last11=Kuhl|first11=D.|last12=Fainsinger|first12=RL.|title=Suffering With Advanced Cancer|journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology|date=May 1, 2007|volume=25|issue=13|pages=1691–1697|doi=10.1200/JCO.2006.08.6801|url=http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/25/13/1691|accessdate=15 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329234159/http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/25/13/1691|archivedate=29 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Health care]] addresses this suffering in many ways, in subfields such as [[medicine]], [[clinical psychology]], [[psychotherapy]], [[alternative medicine]], [[hygiene]], [[public health]], and through various [[health care provider]]s.

Health care approaches to suffering, however, remain problematic.  Physician and author Eric Cassell, widely cited on the subject of attending to the suffering person as a primary goal of medicine, has defined suffering as "the state of severe distress associated with events that threaten the intactness of the person".&lt;ref&gt;Eric J Cassell, ''The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cassell writes: "The obligation of physicians to relieve human suffering stretches back to antiquity. Despite this fact, little attention is explicitly given to the problem of suffering in medical education, research or practice." Mirroring the traditional body and mind dichotomy that underlies its teaching and practice, medicine strongly distinguishes [[pain]] from suffering, and most attention goes to the treatment of pain. Nevertheless, physical pain itself still lacks adequate attention from the medical community, according to numerous reports.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance the [http://www.ampainsoc.org/advocacy/legislative.htm National Pain Care Policy Act of 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515223432/http://www.ampainsoc.org/advocacy/legislative.htm |date=May 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, some medical fields like [[palliative care]], [[pain management|pain management (or pain medicine)]], [[oncology]], or [[psychiatry]], do somewhat address suffering 'as such'. In palliative care, for instance, pioneer [[Cicely Saunders]] created the concept of 'total pain' ('total suffering' say now the textbooks),&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.jpsmjournal.com/article/S0885-3924(03)00516-5/fulltext Existential pain&amp;nbsp;— an entity, a provocation, or a challenge?] in Journal of Pain Symptom and Management, Volume 27, Issue 3, Pages 241-250 (March 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; which encompasses the whole set of physical and mental distress, discomfort, symptoms, problems, or needs that a patient may experience hurtfully.

==Relief and prevention in society==
Since suffering is such a universal motivating experience, people, when asked, can relate their activities to its relief and prevention. Farmers, for instance, may claim that they prevent famine, artists may say that they take our minds off our worries, and teachers may hold that they hand down tools for coping with life hazards. In certain aspects of collective life, however, suffering is more readily an explicit concern by itself. Such aspects may include [[public health]], [[human rights]], [[humanitarian aid]], [[disaster relief]], [[philanthropy]], [[economic aid]], [[social services]], [[insurance]], and [[animal welfare]]. To these can be added the aspects of [[security]] and [[safety]], which relate to precautionary measures taken by individuals or families, to interventions by the military, the police, the firefighters, and to notions or fields like [[social security]], [[environmental security]], and [[human security]].

==Uses==
Philosopher Leonard Katz wrote: "But Nature, as we now know, regards ultimately only fitness and not our happiness (...), and does not scruple to use hate, fear, punishment and even war alongside affection in ordering social groups and selecting among them, just as she uses pain as well as pleasure to get us to feed, water and protect our bodies and also in forging our social bonds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Katz, Leonard David |title=Evolutionary origins of morality: cross-disciplinary perspectives |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Devon |year=2000 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=inmTyPPdR5oC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PRA1-PR15,M1 xv] |isbn=0-907845-07-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People make use of suffering for specific social or personal purposes in many areas of human life, as can be seen in the following instances:

*In arts, literature, or entertainment, people may use suffering for creation, for performance, or for enjoyment. Entertainment particularly makes use of suffering in [[blood sport]]s and [[Violence#Violence in the media|violence in the media]], including [[Video game controversy|violent video games]] depiction of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carlsson |first1=Ulla |title=Children and Media Violence |url=http://survivorbb.rapeutation.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=39&amp;start=5 |website=Altruistic World Online Library |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more or less great amount of suffering is involved in [[body art]]. The most common forms of body art include [[tattooing]], [[body piercing]], [[scarification]], [[human branding]]. Another form of body art is a sub-category of [[performance art]], in which for instance the body is mutilated or pushed to its physical limits.
*In business and various organizations, suffering may be used for constraining humans or animals into required behaviors.
*In a criminal context, people may use suffering for coercion, revenge, or pleasure.
*In interpersonal relationships, especially in places like families, schools, or workplaces, suffering is used for various motives, particularly under the form of [[abuse]] and [[punishment]]. In another fashion related to interpersonal relationships, the sick, or victims, or [[malingering|malingerers]], may use suffering more or less voluntarily to get [[Primary gain|primary, secondary, or tertiary gain]].
*In law, suffering is used for [[punishment]] (see [[penal law]] ); victims may refer to what legal texts call "[[pain and suffering]]" to get compensation; lawyers may use a victim's suffering as an argument against the accused; an accused's or defendant's suffering may be an argument in their favor; authorities at times use light or heavy [[torture]] in order to get information or a confession.
*In the news media, suffering is often the raw material.&lt;ref&gt;This observation is common. See for instance Public Acts: Disruptive Readings on Making Curriculum Public, by Jose Francisco Ibáñez-Carrasco, Erica R. Meiners, Suzanne De Castell: "In our era of information saturation, media uses pain, suffering, and desire to distract and to create spectacular roadkill out of poverty, deviancy, and violence (...)" (available at https://books.google.com/books?id=slYkeuZ3KQoC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=%22media+uses+pain%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=F_qccUl4dL&amp;sig=5HoSwY1BNPB_ydldia-Dgx-niOw&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result). See also for instance [[Arthur Kleinman]] about the uses and abuses of images of suffering in the media.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In personal conduct, people may use suffering for themselves, in a positive way.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Viktor Frankl's [[Man's Search for Meaning]]&lt;/ref&gt; Personal suffering may lead, if bitterness, depression, or spitefulness is avoided, to character-building, spiritual growth, or moral achievement;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fukuyama, Francis |title=Our posthuman future: consequences of the biotechnology revolution |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |location=New York |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-374-23643-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; realizing the extent or gravity of suffering in the world may motivate one to relieve it and may give an inspiring direction to one's life. Alternatively, people may make self-detrimental use of suffering. Some may be caught in compulsive reenactment of painful feelings in order to protect them from seeing that those feelings have their origin in unmentionable past experiences; some may addictively indulge in disagreeable emotions like fear, anger, or jealousy, in order to enjoy pleasant feelings of arousal or release that often accompany these emotions; some may engage in acts of [[self-harm]] aimed at relieving otherwise unbearable states of mind.
*In politics, there is purposeful infliction of suffering in [[war]], [[torture]], and [[terrorism]]; people may use nonphysical suffering against competitors in nonviolent power struggles; people who argue for a policy may put forward the need to relieve, prevent or avenge suffering; individuals or groups may use past suffering as a political lever in their favor.
*In religion, suffering is used especially to grow spiritually, to expiate, to inspire compassion and help, to frighten, to punish.
*In [[rites of passage]] (see also [[hazing]], [[ragging]]), rituals that make use of suffering are frequent.
*In science, humans and animals are subjected on purpose to aversive experiences for the study of suffering or other phenomena.
*In sex, especially in a context of [[sadism and masochism]] or [[BDSM]], individuals may use a certain amount of physical or mental suffering (e.g. pain, humiliation).
*In sports, suffering may be used to outperform competitors or oneself; see [[sports injury]], and [[no pain, no gain]]; see also [[blood sport]] and [[violence in sport]] as instances of pain-based entertainment.

[[Image:Systems thinking about the society.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|Impression of systems thinking about society]]

'''Systems science''' is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field that studies the nature of [[system]]s—from simple to complex—in [[nature]], [[society]], [[cognition]], [[engineering]], [[technology]] and [[science]] itself. To systems scientists, the world can be understood as a system of systems.&lt;ref&gt; G. E. Mobus &amp; M. C. Kalton, ''Principles of Systems Science'', 2015, New York:Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; The field aims to develop interdisciplinary foundations that are applicable in a variety of areas, such as psychology, biology, medicine, communication, business management, engineering,  and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip M'Pherson]] (1974, p. 229); as cited by: Hieronymi, A. (2013), Understanding Systems Science: A Visual and Integrative Approach. ''Syst. Res.''. {{doi|10.1002/sres.2215}}. He defined systems science as "the ordered arrangement of knowledge acquired from the study of systems in the observable world, together with the application of this knowledge to the design of man-made systems."&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems science covers [[formal sciences]] such as [[complex systems]], [[cybernetics]], [[dynamical systems theory]], [[information theory]], [[linguistics]] or [[systems theory]]. It has applications in the field of the natural and social sciences and engineering, such as [[control theory]], [[operations research]], social systems theory, [[systems biology]], [[system dynamics]], [[human factors]], [[systems ecology]], [[systems engineering]] and [[systems psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Francis Heylighen]] in "What are Cybernetics and Systems Science?" on ''Principia Cybernetica Web'' (1999) systems science is an "[[Fields of science|academic domain]], that touches virtually all traditional disciplines, from [[mathematics]], [[technology]] and [[biology]] to [[philosophy]] and the [[social sciences]]."&lt;/ref&gt; Themes commonly stressed in system science are (a) holistic view, (b) interaction between a system and its embedding environment, and (c) complex (often subtle) trajectories of dynamic behavior that sometimes are stable (and thus reinforcing), while at various '[[boundary conditions]]' can become wildly unstable (and thus destructive). Concerns about Earth-scale biosphere/geosphere dynamics is an example of the nature of problems to which systems science seeks to contribute meaningful insights.

== Theories ==
Since the emergence of [[Systems theory|general systems research]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert L. Flood]] (1993) ''Dealing with Complexity: : An Introduction to the Theory and Application of Systems Science.'' p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Systems theory|systems thinking]] and systems science have developed into many [[theoretical]] frameworks.
[[Image:Henk Bikker 1991.jpg|thumb|240px|Systems notes of Henk Bikker, [[TU Delft]], 1991]]
;Systems analysis
:[[Systems analysis]] is the branch of systems science that analyzes systems, the interactions within those systems, and/or interaction with its environment,&lt;ref name="AD 1971"&gt;Anthony Debons. "Command and Control: Technology and Social Impact" in:  ''Advances in computers,'' Vol. 11. Franz L. Alt &amp; Morris Rubinoff eds. (1971). p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; often prior to their automation as computer models. This field is closely related to [[operations research]].
;Systems design
:Systems design is the process of "establishing and specifying the optimum system component configuration for achieving specific goal or objective."&lt;ref name="AD 1971"/&gt; For example in computing, systems design can define the [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[systems architecture]]  which includes many sub-architectures including [[software]] architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and [[data]], as well as security, information, and others,  for a [[computer system]] to satisfy specified [[requirement]]s.
;System dynamics
:[[System dynamics]] is an approach to understanding the behavior of [[complex system]]s over time. It offers "simulation technique for modeling business and social systems,"&lt;ref&gt;Center for Complex Adaptive Agent Systems Simulation Argonne National Laboratory (2007) ''Managing Business Complexity : Discovering Strategic Solutions with Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation: Discovering Strategic Solutions with Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation.'' Oxford University Press. p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; which deals with internal feedback loops and time delays that affect the behavior of the entire system.  What makes using system dynamics different from other approaches to studying complex systems is the use of [[feedback]] loops and [[Stock and flow|stocks and flows]].
;Systems engineering
:[[Systems engineering]] (SE) is an interdisciplinary field of [[engineering]], that focuses on the development and organization of complex [[system]]s. It is the "art and science of creating whole solutions to complex problems,"&lt;ref&gt;Derek K. Hitchins (2008) ''Systems Engineering: A 21st Century Systems Methodology.'' p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;  for example: [[signal processing]] systems, [[control system]]s and [[communication system]], or other forms of high-level modelling and design in specific fields of engineering.
;Systems methodologies
:There are several types of Systems Methodologies, that is, disciplines for analysis of systems. For example:
:* [[Soft systems methodology]] (SSM) : in the field of organizational studies is an approach to organisational process modelling, and it can be used both for general [[problem]] solving and in the management of change. It was developed in [[England]] by academics at the [[University of Lancaster]] Systems Department through a ten-year Action Research programme.
:* [[System development methodology]] (SDM) in the field of IT development is a variety of structured, organized processes for developing information technology and embedded software systems.
:* [[Viable systems approach]] (vSa) is a methodology useful for the understanding and governance of complex phenomena; it has been successfully proposed in the field of management, decision making, marketing and service.
;Systems theories
:[[Systems theory]] is an interdisciplinary field that studies [[complex system]]s in [[nature]], [[society]], and [[science]].  More specifically, it is a conceptual framework by which one can analyze and/or describe any group of objects that work in concert to produce some result.
;Systems science
:Systems sciences are scientific disciplines partly based on systems thinking such as [[chaos theory]], [[complex systems]], [[control theory]], [[cybernetics]], [[sociotechnical systems theory]], [[systems biology]], [[systems chemistry]], [[systems ecology]], [[systems psychology]] and the already mentioned systems dynamics, systems engineering, and systems theory.

== Fields ==
Systems sciences cover [[formal sciences]] like [[dynamical systems theory]] and applications in the natural and social sciences and engineering, such as social systems theory and [[system dynamics]].

{{Main|List of systems scientists}}
General systems scientists can be divided into different generations. The founders of the systems movement like [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], [[Kenneth Boulding]], [[Ralph Gerard]], [[James Grier Miller]], [[George J. Klir]], and [[Anatol Rapoport]] were all born between 1900 and 1920. They all came from different natural and social science disciplines and joined forces in the 1950s to establish the general systems theory [[paradigm]]. Along with the organization of their efforts a first generation of systems scientists rose.

Among them were other scientists like Ackoff, Ashby, Margaret Mead and Churchman, who popularized the systems concept in the 1950s and 1960s. These scientists inspired and educated a second generation with more notable scientists like [[Ervin Laszlo]] (1932) and [[Fritjof Capra]] (1939), who wrote about systems theory in the 1970s and 1980s. Others got acquainted and started studying these works in the 1980s and started writing about it since the 1990s. [[Debora Hammond]] can be seen as a typical representative of these third generation of general systems scientists.

== Organizations ==
{{Main|List of systems sciences organizations}}

The [[International Society for the Systems Sciences]] (ISSS) is an organisation for interdisciplinary collaboration and synthesis of systems sciences. The ISSS is unique among systems-oriented institutions in terms of the breadth of its scope, bringing together scholars and practitioners from academic, business, government, and non-profit organizations. Based on fifty years of tremendous interdisciplinary research from the scientific study of complex systems to interactive approaches in management and community development. This society was initially conceived in 1954 at the Stanford [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]] by [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], [[Kenneth Boulding]], [[Ralph Gerard]], and [[Anatol Rapoport]].

In the field of systems science the [[International Federation for Systems Research]] (IFSR) is an international federation for global and local societies in the field of systems science. This federation is a non-profit, scientific and educational [[non-profit organization|agency]] founded in 1981, and constituted of some thirty member organizations from various countries. The overall purpose of this Federation is to advance [[cybernetic]] and [[systems research]] and systems applications and to serve the international systems community.

The best known research institute in the field is the [[Santa Fe Institute]] (SFI) located in Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States, dedicated to the study of [[complex systems]]. This institute was founded in 1984 by [[George Cowan]], [[David Pines]], [[Stirling Colgate]], [[Murray Gell-Mann]], [[Nick Metropolis]], Herb Anderson, Peter A. Carruthers, and Richard Slansky. All but Pines and Gell-Mann were scientists with [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. SFI's original mission was to disseminate the notion of a separate [[interdisciplinary]] research area, [[complex adaptive system|complexity theory]] referred to at SFI as [[complexity science]]. Recently, [[IIT Jodhpur]] in Rajasthan, India started inculcating system science and engineering to its students through Bachelors, Masters and Doctorate programs. This makes it the first institution to offer [[system science]] education to students in India.

'''''Tagmar''''' is a [[roleplaying game]] (RPG) launched in 1991 by GSA that claims to be the first such Brazilian offering on what was at the time a nascent market.
The game was a typical early 1990s RPG but featured a series of innovations, the main one being that it was a self-contained package with everything necessary to play provided in a single book: rules, setting, magic, creatures and a pre-prepared adventure for beginners.  At the time, RPG books were imported to Brazil and it was necessary to have several to play a game.
Based on the works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], Tagmar faced accusations that it was  based on [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] (D&amp;D), especially from ''Dragão Brasil'' magazine, at the time edited by [[Marcelo Cassaro]], while others claimed that it was very different. Due to a variety of factors including price, availability and innovation, such as the unprecedented concept of "Heroic Energy", in a short time Tagmar became a success and gathered a large fan base.
During the 1990s, the "world" of Tagmar was enlarged through the publication of complementary books such as the "Creatures Book" (''Livro de Criaturas'') and "The Empire" (''O Império''). These books provided details on the appearance, skills and habitat of the creatures of Tagmar as well as information about new geographic regions.

This success continued until 1997 when the publisher GSA closed down leaving Tagmar to stagnate.

==History ==
Launched in 1991, the same year that Devir launched [[GURPS]] in Brazil, the first Brazilian RPG is based on the stories of fantasy of [[JRR Tolkien]], the game was accused of be a copy of Dungeons and Dragons, only to be released in 1993 by Grow until then, the system was known only to players who played with the original versions in English. In 1992, GSA published the second Brazilian RPG, O Desafio dos Bandeirantes (The Challenge of the Explorers), set in [[Colonial Brazil]].
Five supplements were published: O Arado de Ouro, O Livro de Criaturas, A Fronteira, the [[gamebook]] Estandarte Sangrento and O Império, however, the label closed in 1997.
In 2004, the authors of Tagmar decided to republish the game, released on an official website, "Tagmar 2" was made available through a [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons Non-Commercial license]].

In 2006, Tagmar no longer restricted to the system itself and the scene happened to be adapted to other systems, the first system chosen was the Daemon of Daemon Editora. In February 2007, it announced the project to adapt the [[D20 System]], on the official site there are also adaptations for GURPS, Mutants &amp; Masterminds  and Dungeon World, 11 in 2011, has been published adventure O Casamento, an e-book to set in the backdrop of Tagmar for Old Dragon.

==Published material==

Currently, Tagmar 2 has an extensive list of published titles that can be downloaded for free from the official site. Among these are:

* ''Manual de Regras'' (Rules Handbook)
* ''Livro dos Reinos'' (Book of Kingdoms) &lt;!-- was Kingdons --&gt;

[[File:Truthiness.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Stephen Colbert]] uses "truthiness" on the debut episode of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'']]

'''Truthiness''' is the belief or assertion that a particular statement is true based on the [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] or perceptions of some individual or individuals, without regard to [[evidence]], [[logic]], [[Intelligence|intellectual]] examination, or [[fact]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/12/12/opinion/meyer/main2250923.shtml |title=The Truth of Truthiness |first=Dick |last=Meyer |publisher=CBS News |date=December 12, 2006 |accessdate=December 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Truthiness | website=Dictionary.com Unabridged | publisher=Random House | url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/truthiness | accessdate=May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Truthiness can range from ignorant assertions of falsehoods to deliberate duplicity or propaganda intended to sway opinions.&lt;ref name="Hayes-Roth, p. 5"&gt;{{cite book | title=Truthiness Fever | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gRIE3PGf-1YC | author=Hayes-Roth, Rick | publisher=BookLocker.com, Inc. | year=2015 | page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wPMCwAAQBA | title=Rethinking Psychology: Good Science, Bad Science, Pseudoscience | author=Hughes, Brian | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan | year=2016 | page=35 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of truthiness has emerged as a major subject of discussion surrounding [[Politics of the United States|U.S. politics]] during the 1990s and 2000s because of the perception among some observers of a rise in propaganda and a growing hostility toward factual reporting and fact-based discussion.&lt;ref name="Hayes-Roth, p. 5"/&gt;

American television comedian [[Stephen Colbert]] coined the term ''truthiness'' in this meaning&lt;ref name="zimmer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002586.html |last=Zimmer |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Zimmer |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=Language Log: Truthiness or Trustiness?}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the subject of a segment called "[[Recurring segments on The Colbert Report#The Wørd|The Wørd]]" during the pilot episode of his political satire program ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' on October 17, 2005. By using this as part of his routine, Colbert satirized the misuse of [[appeal to emotion]] and "gut feeling" as a rhetorical device in contemporaneous socio-political discourse.&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/stephen-colbert-13970 |title=Interview: Stephen Colbert |first=Nathan |last=Rabin |publisher=A.V. Club |date=January 25, 2006 |accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He particularly applied it to U.S. President [[George W. Bush]]'s [[Harriet Miers Supreme Court nomination|nomination]] of [[Harriet Miers]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] and the [[Rationale for the Iraq War|decision to invade Iraq]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="word"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/63ite2/the-colbert-report-the-word---truthiness |date=October 17, 2005 |accessdate=November 7, 2018 |title=The Colbert Report: Videos: The Word (Truthiness)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert later ascribed truthiness to other institutions and organizations, including [[Wikiality|Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedycentral.com/motherload/index.jhtml?ml_video=72347 |title=The Colbert Report / Comedy Central recording of The WØRD "Wikiality" |work=[[Comedy Central]] |date=July 31, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308053730/http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=72347 |archivedate=March 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert has sometimes used a [[Dog Latin]] version of the term, "Veritasiness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://firedoglake.com/2006/06/05/a-stop-on-the-veritasiness-tour-2006/ |accessdate=September 3, 2010 |date=June 5, 2006 |title=A Stop on the Veritasiness Tour 2006 |work=Firedoglake |first=Christy Hardin |last=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Colbert's "Operation Iraqi Stephen: Going Commando" the word "Veritasiness" can be seen on the banner above the eagle on the operation's seal.

''[[wikt:truthiness|Truthiness]]'' was named [[Word of the Year]] for 2005 by the [[American Dialect Society]] and for 2006 by [[Merriam-Webster]].&lt;ref name="dialectsoc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americandialect.org/Words_of_the_Year_2005.pdf |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=Truthiness Voted 2005 Word of the Year by American Dialect Society |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/info/06words.htm |title=Merriam-Webster's Words of the Year 2006 |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=December 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist and ''OED'' consultant [[Benjamin Zimmer]]&lt;ref name="zimmer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~bgzimmer/ |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=Benjamin Zimmer homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that the word ''truthiness''&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11182033/site/newsweek/ |title=The Truthiness Teller |first=Marc |last=Peyser |journal=Newsweek |issn=0028-9604 |date=February 13, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060425101629/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11182033/site/newsweek/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=April 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; already had a history in literature and appears in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED''), as a derivation of ''[[:wikt:truthy|truthy]]'', and ''[[The Century Dictionary]]'', both of which indicate it as rare or dialectal, and to be defined more straightforwardly as "truthfulness, faithfulness".&lt;ref name="zimmer" /&gt; Responding to claims by Michael Adams that the word already existed with a different meaning, Colbert said, "Truthiness is a word I pulled right out of my [[wikt:keister|keister]]".&lt;ref name=Kiser /&gt;

==Use by Stephen Colbert==
[[Stephen Colbert]], portraying his character [[Stephen Colbert (character)|Dr. Stephen T. Colbert]], chose the word ''truthiness'' just moments before taping the premiere episode of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' on October 17, 2005, after deciding that the originally scripted word – "truth" – was not absolutely ridiculous enough: "We're not talking about truth, we're talking about something that seems like truth – the truth we want to exist", he explained.&lt;ref name="nymag"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://nymag.com/news/politics/22322/index1.html |title=Stephen Colbert Has America by the Ballots |first=Adam |last=Sternbergh |journal=New York Magazine |issn=0362-4331 |date=October 16, 2006 |accessdate=October 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ColbertWriters"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvnHf3MQtAk&amp;t=1m |title=Colbert Report Writers – The Truthiness Behind The Lines, Truthiness and Pun Journals |publisher=The Paley Center, YouTube channel |date=November 7, 2009 |accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced his definition in the first segment of the episode, saying: "Now I'm sure some of the 'word police', the 'wordinistas' over at [[Merriam-Webster|Webster's]] are gonna say, 'Hey, that's not a word'. Well, anybody who knows me knows I'm no fan of dictionaries or reference books. They're elitist. Constantly telling us what is or isn't true. Or what did or didn't happen."&lt;ref name="word" /&gt;

When asked in an [[Breaking character|out-of-]][[Stephen Colbert (character)|character]] interview with ''[[The Onion]]'''s [[The A.V. Club|A.V. Club]] for his views on "the 'truthiness' imbroglio that's tearing our country apart", Colbert elaborated on the critique he intended to convey with the word:&lt;ref name="avclub" /&gt;

{{quote|Truthiness is tearing apart our country, and I don't mean the argument over who came up with the word ...

It used to be, everyone was entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts. But that's not the case anymore. Facts matter not at all. Perception is everything. It's certainty. People love the President [George W. Bush] because he's certain of his choices as a leader, even if the facts that back him up don't seem to exist. It's the fact that he's certain that is very appealing to a certain section of the country. I really feel a dichotomy in the American populace. What is important? What you want to be true, or what is true?...

Truthiness is 'What I say is right, and [nothing] anyone else says could possibly be true.' It's not only that I ''feel'' it to be true, but that ''I'' feel it to be true. There's not only an emotional quality, but there's a selfish quality.}}

During an interview on December 8, 2006, with [[Charlie Rose]],&lt;ref name="Charlie Rose"&gt;Charlie Rose (December 8, 2006), [http://www.charlierose.com/shows/2006/12/08/2/a-conversation-with-comedian-stephen-colbert "A conversation with comedian Stephen Colbert"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915040747/http://www.charlierose.com/shows/2006/12/08/2/a-conversation-with-comedian-stephen-colbert |date=September 15, 2008 }}. Retrieved on August 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert stated:

{{quote|I was thinking of the idea of passion and emotion and certainty over information. And what you feel in your gut, as I said in the first Wørd we did, which was sort of a thesis statement of the whole show – however long it lasts – is that sentence, that one word, that's more important to, I think, the public at large, and not just the people who provide it in prime-time cable, than information.}}

On his April 2, 2009 episode of ''The Colbert Report'', Colbert added an addendum to the definition: a word so straight that it drives men wild.

==Coverage by news media==
After Colbert's introduction of truthiness, it quickly became widely used and recognized. Six days after, [[CNN]]'s ''[[Reliable Sources]]'' featured a discussion of ''The Colbert Report'' by host [[Howard Kurtz]], who played a clip of Colbert's definition.&lt;ref&gt;It was also used September 23, 2008 by CNN's American Morning by John Roberts.
{{cite news |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0510/23/rs.01.html |title=CNN Reliable Sources |author=Howard Kurtz (transcript) |publisher=CNN |date=October 23, 2005 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'' also reported on truthiness, prompting Colbert to respond by saying: "You know what was missing from that piece? Me. Stephen Colbert. But I'm not surprised. ''Nightline'''s on opposite me..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iseeseveralflaws.com/dirt/archives/000426.html |title=[D1RT]: stephen colbert on... |accessdate=September 19, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224145226/http://www.iseeseveralflaws.com/dirt/archives/000426.html |archivedate=December 24, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few months of its introduction by Colbert, truthiness was discussed in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[USA Weekly]]'', the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', [[CNN]], [[MSNBC]], [[Fox News]], the [[Associated Press]], ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]'', ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'', ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', [[CNET]], and on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'', [[CBS]]'s ''[[60 Minutes]]'', and ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''.

The February 13, 2006 issue of ''Newsweek'' featured an article on ''The Colbert Report'' titled "The Truthiness Teller", recounting the career of the word ''truthiness'' since its popularization by Colbert.&lt;ref name="newsweek" /&gt;

===''The New York Times'' coverage and usage===
In its issue of October 25, 2005, eight days after the premiere episode of the ''Report'', ''The New York Times'' ran its third article on ''The Colbert Report'', "Bringing Out the Absurdity of the News".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/25/arts/television/25watc.html&lt;!--http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A16F83B5B0C768EDDA90994DD404482--&gt; |title=Bringing Out the Absurdity of the News |first=Allesandra |last=Stanley |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |date=October 25, 2005 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article specifically discussed the segment on "truthiness", although the ''Times'' misreported the word as "trustiness". In its November 1, 2005 issue, the ''Times'' ran a correction. On the next episode of the ''Report'', Colbert took the ''Times'' to task for the error, pointing out, ironically, that "trustiness" is "not even a word".&lt;ref&gt;Many dictionaries (e.g. [http://www.bartleby.com/61/32/T0393200.html American Heritage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010192553/http://www.bartleby.com/61/32/T0393200.html |date=October 10, 2006 }}, [http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=trustiness Merriam-Webster], New Oxford Dictionary of English, etc.) offer definitions for ''trustiness''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' again discussed "truthiness" in its issue of December 25, 2005, this time as one of nine words that had captured the year's [[zeitgeist]], in an article titled "2005: In a Word; Truthiness" by Jacques Steinberg. In crediting ''truthiness'', Steinberg said, "the [[pundit (politics)|pundit]] who probably drew the most attention in 2005 was only playing one on TV: Stephen Colbert".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/weekinreview/25track.ready.html?ei=5090&amp;en=0ad1e6ef6392c7da&amp;ex=1293166800&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1137484544-pMx4vqbEIRjCInvXH5mFzg |title=2005: In a Word: Truthiness |first=Jacques |last=Steinberg |authorlink=Jacques Steinberg |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |date=December 25, 2005 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the January 22, 2006 issue, columnist [[Frank Rich]] used the term seven times, with credit to Colbert, in a column titled "Truthiness 101: From Frey to Alito",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/22/opinion/truthiness-101-from-frey-to-alito.html |title=Truthiness 101: From Frey to Alito |first=Frank |last=Rich |authorlink=Frank Rich |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |date=January 22, 2006 |accessdate=December 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; to discuss Republican portrayals of several issues (including the [[Samuel Alito]] nomination, the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]]'s response to [[Hurricane Katrina]], and [[Jack Murtha]]'s [[Vietnam War]] record). Rich emphasized the extent to which the word had quickly become a cultural fixture, writing, "The mock Comedy Central pundit Stephen Colbert's slinging of the word 'truthiness' caught on instantaneously last year precisely because we live in the age of truthiness." ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]'' reported on Rich's use of "truthiness" in his column, saying he "tackled the growing trend to 'truthiness,' as opposed to truth, in the U.S."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/PrintArticle/-NY-Times-Frank-Rich-Taking-Book-Leave |title='NY Times' Frank Rich Taking Book Leave |author=Strupp, Joe |date=January 22, 2006 |accessdate=January 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' published two letters on the 2006 [[White House]] [[White House Correspondents' Association|Correspondents' Dinner]], where [[Stephen Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner|Stephen Colbert was the featured guest]], in its May 3, 2006 edition, under the headline "Truthiness and Power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/03/opinion/l03colbert.html?ex=1149652800&amp;en=be69d253b7aa626d&amp;ei=5070 |title=Truthiness and Power |last1=Howard |first1=Gloria D. |last2=Phillian |first2=William M. |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |date=May 3, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Rich referenced truthiness again in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2008, describing the strategy of [[John McCain presidential campaign, 2008|John McCain's presidential campaign]] as being "to envelop the entire presidential race in a thick fog of truthiness",&lt;ref name="Rich '08"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/opinion/21rich.html |title=Truthiness Stages a Comeback |last=Rich |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Rich |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |date=September 21, 2008 |accessdate=September 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rich explained that the campaign was based on truthiness because "McCain, [[Sarah Palin]] and their surrogates keep repeating the same lies over and over not just to smear their opponents and not just to mask their own record. Their larger aim is to construct a bogus alternative reality so relentless it can overwhelm any haphazard journalistic stabs at puncturing it."&lt;ref name="Rich '08" /&gt; Rich also noted, "You know the press is impotent at unmasking this truthiness when the hardest-hitting interrogation McCain has yet faced on television came on '' '[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'.'' [[Barbara Walters]] and [[Joy Behar]] called him on several falsehoods, including his endlessly repeated [[Sarah Palin#Federal funding|fantasy that Palin opposed earmarks]] for Alaska. Behar used the word 'lies' to his face."&lt;ref name="Rich '08" /&gt;

==Widespread recognition==

Usage of "truthiness" continued to proliferate in media, politics, and public consciousness. On January 5, 2006, [[etymology]] professor [[Anatoly Liberman]] began an hour-long program on [[public radio]] by discussing truthiness and predicting that it would be included in dictionaries in the next year or two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/programs/midmorning/listings/mm20060102.shtml |date=January 5, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=Where Words Come From}}&lt;/ref&gt; His prediction seemed to be on track when, the next day, the [[American Dialect Society]] announced that "truthiness" was its 2005 Word of the Year, and the website of the ''Macmillan English Dictionary'' featured ''truthiness'' as its Word of the Week a few weeks later.&lt;ref name="mac"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/New-Words/060213-truthiness.htm |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=Word of the Week Archive |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323074132/http://www.macmillandictionary.com/New-Words/060213-truthiness.htm &lt;!--http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A16F83B5B0C768EDDA90994DD404482--&gt; |archivedate=March 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Truthiness'' was also selected by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as one of nine words that captured the spirit of 2005. [[Global Language Monitor]],&lt;ref&gt;
|url=http://www.languagemonitor.com&lt;/ref&gt; which tracks trends in languages, named ''truthiness'' the top television buzzword of 2006, and another term Colbert coined with reference to truthiness, ''[[Wikipedia in culture#Wikiality|wikiality]]'', as another of the top ten television buzzwords of 2006, the first time two words from the same show have made the list.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was listed in the annual "[[Banished Word List]]" released by a committee at [[Lake Superior State University]] in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan]] in 2007. The list included "truthiness" among other overused terms, such as "awesome" celebrity couple [[portmanteau]]s such as "[[Brangelina]]", and "[[pwn]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lssu.edu/banished/archive/2007.php Lake Superior State University 2007 List of Banished Words] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919133033/http://www.lssu.edu/banished/archive/2007.php |date=September 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, on January 8, 2007 Colbert stated that Lake Superior State University was an "[[attention-seeking]] second-tier state university".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nofactzone.net/?p=720 Colbert Report Episode 3001 (1/8/2006) overview]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 List of Banished Words restored "truthiness" to formal usage, in response to the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lssu.edu/banished/archive/2008.php Lake Superior State University 2008 List of Banished Words] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017001524/http://lssu.edu/banished/archive/2008.php |date=October 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Dialect Society's Word of the Year===
On January 6, 2006, the [[American Dialect Society]] announced that "truthiness" was selected as its 2005 [[Word of the Year (American Dialect Society)|Word of the Year]]. The Society described its rationale as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In its 16th annual words of the year vote, the American Dialect Society voted ''truthiness'' as the word of the year. First heard on ''The Colbert Report'', a satirical mock news show on the Comedy Central television channel, ''truthiness'' refers to the quality of preferring concepts or facts one wishes or believes to be true, rather than concepts or facts known to be true. As Stephen Colbert put it, "I don't trust books. They're all fact, no heart."&lt;ref name="dialectsoc" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Merriam-Webster's Word of the Year===
On December 10, 2006 the [[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] announced that "truthiness" was selected as its 2006 Word of the Year on [[Lists of Merriam-Webster's Words of the Year|Merriam-Webster's Words of the Year]], based on a reader poll, by a 5–1 margin over the second-place word ''[[Google (verb)|google]]''.&lt;ref name="mw" /&gt; "We're at a point where what constitutes truth is a question on a lot of people's minds, and truth has become up for grabs", said Merriam-Webster president John Morse. {{"'}}Truthiness' is a playful way for us to think about a very important issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/chronicle/4389349.html |title=Colbert's 'truthiness' pronounced Word of the Year |first=Adam |last=Gorlick |publisher=AP/Houston Chronicle |date=December 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite winning Word of the Year, the word does not appear in the 2006 edition of the Merriam-Webster English Dictionary. In response to this omission, during "The Wørd" segment on December 12, 2006 Colbert issued a new page 1344 for the tenth edition of the Merriam Webster dictionary that featured "truthiness". To make room for the definition of "truthiness", including a portrait of Colbert, the definition for the word "try" was removed with Colbert stating "Sorry, try. Maybe you should have tried harder." He also sarcastically told viewers to "not" download the new page and "not" glue it in the new dictionary in libraries and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/182467/december-12-2006/who-s-honoring-me-now----merriam-webster-s-word-of-the-year |title=Who's Honoring Me Now? – Merriam-Webster's Word of the Year |first=Stephen |last=Colbert |publisher=Colbert Nation |date=December 12, 2006 |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The New York Times'' crossword puzzle ===
In the June 14, 2008 edition of ''The New York Times'', the word was featured as 1-across in the [[The New York Times crossword puzzle|crossword puzzle]]. Colbert mentioned this during the last segment on the June 18 episode of ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'', and declared himself the "King of the Crossword".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=174004&amp;title=daily/colbert-crossword-puzzle |title=Daily/Colbert – Crossword Puzzle |date=June 18, 2008 |work=Comedy Central |format=video |accessdate=December 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rexwordpuzzle.blogspot.com/2008/06/saturday-jun-14-2008-brendan-emmett.html |work=Rex Parker does the NYT crossword puzzle (personal blog) |title=Saturday, Jun . 14, 2008 |first=Rex |last=Parker |date=June 14, 2008 |accessdate=June 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BBC "portrait of the decade" ===
In December 2009, the [[BBC]] online magazine asked its readers to nominate suggestions of things to be included on a poster which would represent important events in the 2000s (decade), divided into five different categories: "People", "Words", "News", "Objects" and "Culture". Suggestions were sent in and a panel of five independent experts shortened each category to what they saw as the 20 most important. Among the nominations selected in the "Words" category was "Truthiness". As a result, the word "Truthiness" appeared in the poster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8406898.stm |title=A portrait of the decade |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=December 14, 2009 |accessdate=December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research ===
In 2012, a study examining truthiness was carried out by PhD student Eryn Newman of [[Victoria University of Wellington]]. The experiments showed that people are more likely to believe that a claim is true regardless of evidence when a decorative photograph appears alongside it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Pictures-aid-truthiness-study-reveals/tabid/1160/articleID/265386/Default.aspx |title=Pictures aid 'truthiness', study reveals |first=Dan |last=Satherley |publisher=[[3 News]] |date=August 14, 2012 |accessdate=August 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212053537/http://www.3news.co.nz/Pictures-aid-truthiness-study-reveals/tabid/1160/articleID/265386/Default.aspx |archive-date=February 12, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.springer.com/about+springer/media/springer+select?SGWID=0-11001-6-1385843-0 |title=Scientists discover the truth behind Colbert's "truthiness" |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |date=August 8, 2012 |accessdate=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kitty Genovese case retrospective===

As noted by Jesse Singal in an April 5, 2016 piece "How the False Story of Kitty Genovese’s Murder Went Viral" in [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]] upon the death of [[Murder of Kitty Genovese|Kitty Genovese]]'s murderer, the entire escalation of a myth surrounding the murder, alleging that 38 people had been silent witnesses allowing a vicious death to proceed in front of them, was attributable to the myth's appeal to "truthiness" (grounded in fear – of insecurity and lack of community spirit) over full investigation into actual truth:

"Today, of course, there is exponentially more news coverage than there was in 1964 — not to mention exponentially more attempts to slot attention-getting events into simple, truthy stories about human nature. The gap between the famous version of the Genovese story and the true one, then, is worth remembering, if only as a check on our natural tendency to hear a story and then nod along and say, 'Of course that’s what happened!'”&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/04/how-the-false-story-of-kitty-genovese-s-murder-went-viral.html?om_rid=AAWrdT&amp;om_mid=_BXBAs3B9MJ$ivU "How the False Story of Kitty Genovese’s Murder Went Viral"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Frey controversy===
The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' published an editorial in its January 16, 2006 issue titled "The Truthiness Hurts", crediting the rise of ''truthiness'' as serendipitously providing an apt description of the [[Oprah Book Club]] controversy over [[James Frey]]'s fictionalized "memoir", ''[[A Million Little Pieces]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chi-0601160188jan16,1,4983997.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060125010138/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chi-0601160188jan16,1,4983997.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 25, 2006 |title=The Truthiness Hurts |author=Chicago Tribune editorial board |newspaper=The Chicago Tribune |issn=1085-6706 |date=January 16, 2006 |accessdate=February 1, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- see contemporaneous access at http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Truthiness&amp;diff=37600469&amp;oldid=37592567 --&gt; ''Truthiness'' was also used to describe the controversy over the factual accuracy of Frey's book by ''[[USA Today]]'' in its January 15, 2006 issue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2006-01-15-truth-debate_x.htm |title=Truth falls to "Pieces" after suspect memoir |first=Marco R. |last=Della Cava |newspaper=USA Today |issn=0734-7456 |date=January 15, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; by several other publications including ''[[The New York Times]],'' and by the television news program ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'' on its October 23 and January 26 editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=FA0B12F7395B0C718EDDA80894DE404482 |title=Truthiness 101: From Frey to Alito |first=Frank |last=Rich |authorlink=Frank Rich |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |date=January 22, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oprah Winfrey]] also discussed ''truthiness'' with [[Frank Rich]] on her show, in reference to the Frey controversy and the column "Truthiness 101" Rich had recently published in ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.oprah.com/tows/slide/200601/20060126/slide_20060126_350_204.jhtml |date=January 26, 2006 |title=The Oprah Winfrey Show (transcript) |archivedate=April 1, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401154709/http://www2.oprah.com/tows/slide/200601/20060126/slide_20060126_350_204.jhtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also mentioned Colbert's role in making the word "truthiness".&lt;ref name="carr"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/30/business/media/30carr.html |title=How Oprahness Trumped Truthiness |first=David |last=Carr |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |date=January 30, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 27, [[MSNBC]] ran a commentary titled "Oprah strikes a blow for truthiness: Do facts really matter? Ask Winfrey, James Frey or Stephen Colbert", making the case that Winfrey's about-face on Frey's book was a "small (and belated) but bold nudge back out of the proud halls of truthiness", but also opportunistic and too little too late.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/11044071/ |title=Oprah strikes a blow for truthiness |first=Jon |last=Bonné |publisher=MSNBC |date=January 27, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Canadian Parliament===
In 2006, [[Liberal Party of Canada]] leadership contender [[Ken Dryden]] used truthiness as an extensive theme in a speech in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. The speech dealt critically with the [[28th Canadian Ministry|Harper]] government's [[Universal Child Care Plan]].&lt;ref name="hansard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=1&amp;DocId=2179089#Int-1515982 |date=May 4, 2006 |accessdate=October 16, 2007 |title=''Hansard''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dryden defined truthiness as "something that is spoken as if true that one wants others to believe is true, that said often enough with enough voices orchestrated in behind it, might even sound true, but is not true."

The transcript of all debates in the House ([[Hansard]]) is made available in both official languages; the translators into French chose to render "truthiness" as ''fausse vérité'' ("false truth").&lt;ref name="hansard" /&gt;

===Alleged snubbing by the Associated Press, and Colbert's response===
The [[Associated Press]] reported on the American Dialect Society's selection of truthiness as the Word of the Year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002725801_words07.html |title=Honestly, "truthiness" is selected the word of 2005 |last=Clark |first=Heather |newspaper=The Seattle Times |agency=Associated Press |date=January 1, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060528050238/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002725801_words07.html |archivedate=May 28, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including the following comments by one of the voting linguists:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Michael Adams, a professor at North Carolina State University who specializes in lexicology, said "truthiness" means "truthy, not facty". "The national argument right now is, one, 'Who's got the truth?' and, two, 'Who's got the facts?{{'"}} he said. "Until we can manage to get the two of them back together again, we're not going to make much progress."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On each of the first four episodes of the ''Report'' after the selection of ''truthiness'' as ''Word of the Year,'' Colbert lamented that news reports neglected to acknowledge him as the source of the word. On the first of these episodes, he added Michael Adams to his "On Notice" board, and Associated Press reporter Heather Clark, the author of the article, to his "Dead to Me" board:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/videos/notice/index.jhtml |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=The Colbert Report: Videos: On Notice (A Glaring Omission)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"You see, the Associated Press article announcing this prestigious award, written by one Heather Clark, had a glaring omission: me," Colbert said during his show Monday. "I'm not mentioned, despite the fact that truthiness is a word I pulled right out of my keister."&lt;ref name=Kiser &gt;{{Citation |last=Kiser |first=Emily |date=January 10, 2006 |title=Colbert puts professor 'on notice': Michael Adams, featured in a recent Associated Press article, incurs the wrath of Comedy Central 'pundit' |publisher=''[[Technician (newspaper)|Technician]]'' |url=http://www.technicianonline.com/article_895be1b8-7968-5f83-b414-2957431242ac.html |accessdate=February 5, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Later Adams admitted the "absolutely hilarious" nature of the show and said he couldn't "think of any greater honor than to be placed on Colbert's 'On Notice' board," and that he "owes Colbert thanks."&lt;ref name=Kiser /&gt;

On the third of these episodes, he ranked the AP at the top of the "Threat-Down",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/videos/threatdown/index.jhtml |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=The Colbert Report: Videos: Threatdown}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of few entries ever to gain the number one spot in place of bears. On the following episode he called Adams and asked for an apology. Though Adams never apologized, Colbert "accepted" his "apology", but failed to take him "off notice".

====Associated Press response to Colbert====
On January 13, the first day after the four-day run of criticism of the AP on the ''Report,'' the AP ran a story about ''The Colbert Report'' being upset about being snubbed by the AP, in an article titled "Colbert: AP the biggest threat to America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/01/13/ap/entertainment/mainD8F3VNT8E.shtml |title=Colbert: AP the biggest threat to America |first=Jake |last=Coyle |publisher=CBS News / Associated Press |date=January 13, 2006 |accessdate=November 7, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005202936/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/01/13/ap/entertainment/mainD8F3VNT8E.shtml |archivedate=October 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he has in the past, Colbert remained in character in an interview for the story, and used it to further the political satire of ''truthiness''; excerpts of the story are:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When an AP story about the designation sent coast to coast failed to mention Colbert, he began a tongue-in-cheek crusade, not unlike the kind his muse [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] might lead in all seriousness."

{{"'}}It's a sin of omission...' Stephen Colbert told the AP on Thursday...'It's like Shakespeare still being alive and not asking him what ''Hamlet'' is about,' he said."

"The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' has a definition for 'truthy' dating back to the 1800s....'The fact that they looked it up in a book just shows that they don't get the idea of truthiness at all,' Stephen Colbert said Thursday. 'You don't look up truthiness in a book, you look it up in your gut.{{'"}}

"Though slight, the difference of Colbert's definition and the OED's is essential. It's not your typical truth, but, as ''The New York Times'' wrote, 'a summation of what [Colbert] sees as the guiding ethos of the loudest commentators on Fox News, MSNBC and CNN.{{'"}}

"Colbert, who referred on his program to the AP omission as a 'journalistic travesty,' said Thursday that it was similar to the much-criticized weapons of mass destruction reporting leading up to the Iraq War. 'Except,' he said, 'people got hurt this time.'"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On January 14, Clark herself responded in an article titled "Exclusive 'News' – I'm dead to Stephen Colbert".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asap.ap.org/stories/293280.s |last=Clark |first=Healther |date=January 14, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=Exclusive "News": I'm Dead to Stephen Colbert |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929161104/http://asap.ap.org/stories/293280.s |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She furthered the rise of "truthiness" in published English in conceding, "Truthiness be told, I never had seen ''The Colbert Report'' until my name graced its 'Dead to Me' board this week... But I will say that I watched Colbert's show for the first time...It was funny. And that's not just truthy. That's a fact."

===Arianna Huffington===
On January 31, 2006, [[Arianna Huffington]] used ''truthiness'' in [[The Huffington Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/will-americas-new-love-a_b_14809.html |date=January 31, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=Will America's New Love Affair With the Truth Extend to Bush's SOTU Speech? |work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huffington later appeared as a guest on the March 1, 2006, episode of ''The Colbert Report''. She challenged Colbert on his claim that he had invented the word ''truthiness''. During the interview, Colbert declared, "I'm not a truthiness fanatic; I'm truthiness' father." Huffington corrected him, citing Wikipedia, that he had merely "popularized" the term. Regarding her source, Colbert responded: "Fuck them!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/59703/march-01-2006/arianna-huffington |date=March 1, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=The Colbert Report: Videos (Arianna Huffington)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===President George W. Bush===
At the [[Stephen Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner|2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner]], Colbert, the featured guest, described President Bush's thought processes using the definition of truthiness. ''Editor and Publisher'' used "truthiness" to describe Colbert's criticism of Bush, in an article published the same day titled "Colbert Lampoons Bush at White House Correspondents Dinner—President Not Amused?" ''E&amp;P'' reported that the "blistering comedy 'tribute' to President Bush ... left George and Laura Bush unsmiling at its close" and that many people at the dinner "looked a little uncomfortable at times, perhaps feeling the material was a little too biting—or too much speaking 'truthiness' to power".&lt;ref name="editor-and-publisher-2006.04.29"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002425363 |publisher=Editor and Publisher |title=Colbert Lampoons Bush at White House Correspondents Dinner—President Not Amused? |author=E&amp;P Staff |date=April 29, 2006 |accessdate=May 7, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060531012834/http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002425363 &lt;!--http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A16F83B5B0C768EDDA90994DD404482--&gt; |archivedate=May 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''E&amp;P'' reported a few days later that its coverage of Colbert at the dinner drew "possibly its highest one-day traffic total ever", and published a letter to the editor asserting that "Colbert brought truth wrapped in truthiness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/PrintArticle/TUESDAY-S-LETTERS-Colbert-Offensive-Colbert-Mediocre-Colbert-a-Hero-Colbert-Vicious-Colbert-Brave |title=Tuesday's Letters: Colbert Offensive, Colbert Mediocre, Colbert a Hero, Colbert Vicious, Colbert Brave |author=E&amp;P Staff |date=May 2, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same weekend, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and others also reported on the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/29/AR2006042900126.html |title=Dept. of Truthiness: The Colbert Rapport |newspaper=The Washington Post |issn=0740-5421 |date=March 30, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2006/05/01/colbert/index_np.html |title=The truthiness hurts |first=Michael |last=Scherer |journal=Salon |date=May 1, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615011439/http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2006/05/01/colbert/index_np.html |archivedate=June 15, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/04/27/60minutes/main1553506.shtml |date=March 30, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=The Colbert Report: Morley Safer Profiles Comedy Central's "Fake" Newsman |work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six months later, in a column titled "Throw The Truthiness Bums Out", ''[[The New York Times]]'' columnist [[Frank Rich]] called Colbert's after-dinner speech a "cultural primary" and christened it the "defining moment" of the United States' [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]].&lt;ref name="nytimes-truthiness-bums"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/05/opinion/05rich.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |issn=0362-4331 |title=Throw the Truthiness Bums Out |first=Frank |last=Rich |authorlink=Frank Rich |date=November 5, 2006 |accessdate=November 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washpost-bubble-trouble"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2006/11/07/BL2006110700726_5.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |issn=0740-5421 |title=Bubble Trouble |first=Dan |last=Froomkin |authorlink=Dan Froomkin |date=November 7, 2006 |accessdate=November 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Krauthammer===
Conservative commentator [[Charles Krauthammer]] brought the term up in a discussion about President Obama on the show ''[[Fox News All-Stars]]'' in June 2010, saying:
{{quote|What we see here is conditional truthiness. When the administration needs to say, oh, we knew how bad it was, it says it, and when it needs to say we had no idea how bad it was, it says it. It depends when it needs it; it'll invent a new truth.&lt;ref&gt;

===Cato Institute amicus brief===
In 2014, the [[Cato Institute]] filed an amicus brief to the [[United States Supreme Court]] co-authored by humorist [[P. J. O'Rourke]] in the ''[[Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus]]'' free speech case. The brief included an extended discussion of the role of truthiness in American political discourse:&lt;ref name="urlCato AmicusBrief"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/sba-list-merits-filed-brief.pdf |title=Brief for the Cato Institute and P. J. O'Rourke as Amici Curiae |format= |work= |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In modern times, "truthiness"—a "truth" asserted "from the gut" or because it "feels right," without regard to evidence or logic—is also a key part of political discourse. It is difficult to imagine life without it, and our political discourse is weakened by Orwellian laws that try to prohibit it.

After all, where would we be without the knowledge that Democrats are pinko-communist flag-burners who want to tax churches and use the money to fund abortions so they can use the fetal stem cells to create pot-smoking lesbian ATF agents who will steal all the guns and invite the UN to take over America? Voters have to decide whether we'd be better off electing Republicans, those hateful, assault-weapon-wielding maniacs who believe that George Washington and Jesus Christ incorporated the nation after a Gettysburg reenactment and that the only thing wrong with the death penalty is that it isn't administered quickly enough to secular-humanist professors of Chicano studies.}}

==={{anchor|Trumpiness}}''The Late Show with Stephen Colbert''===
Colbert refreshed "truthiness" in an episode of ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'' on July 18, 2016, using the neologism "Trumpiness" regarding statements made by [[Donald Trump]] during [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|his presidential campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/2016/07/22/colbert_goes_after_trumpiness_his_live_rnc_coverage_revives_the_comedy_of_the_colbert_report/ | title=Colbert goes After Trumpiness: His live RNC coverage revives the comedy of "The Colbert Report" | work=Salon | date=22 July 2016 | accessdate=16 August 2016 | author=McClennen, Sophia}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Colbert, while truthiness refers to statements that feel true but are actually false, "Trumpiness" does not even have to feel true, much less be true. As evidence that Trump's remarks exhibit this quality, he cited a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' column stating that many Trump supporters did not believe his "wildest promises" but supported him anyway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://theweek.com/speedreads/636881/stephen-colbert-resurrects-colbert-report-word-segment-define-trumpiness | title=Stephen Colbert resurrects his Colbert Report 'The Word' segment to define 'Trumpiness' | work=The Week | date=19 July 2016 | accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.vox.com/2016/7/19/12222520/the-word-colbert-trumpiness-rnc | title=Watch: Stephen Colbert brings back "The Word" to deconstruct the Trump supporter's psyche | work=Vox | date=19 July 2016 | accessdate=16 August 2016 | author=Golshan, Tara}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/07/stephen-colbert-late-show-rnc-jon-stewart | title=Stephen Colbert Brought Back "Stephen Colbert" (and Jon Stewart) During His R.N.C.

* 23 December 1919: United Kingdom: The [[Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919]] became law. In a broad opening statement it specified that, "[a] person shall not be disqualified by sex or marriage from the exercise of any public function, or from being appointed to or holding any civil or judicial office or post, or from entering or assuming or carrying on any civil profession or vocation". The Act did provide employment opportunities for individual women and many were appointed as magistrates, but in practice it fell far short of the expectations of the women's movement. Senior positions in the civil service were still closed to women and they could be excluded from juries if evidence was likely to be too "sensitive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyextra.com/feature/women-first |title=

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15922">In [[political communication]], the phrase "'''you're either with us, or against us'''" and similar variations are used to depict situations as being [[Polarization (politics)|polarized]] and to force [[witness]]es, [[wikt:bystander|bystander]]s, or others unaligned with some form of pre-existing conflict to either become [[allies]] of the speaking party or lose favor. The implied consequence of not joining the team effort is to be deemed an enemy. An example is the statement of the former [[US President]] [[George W. Bush]], who said after [[9/11]] at the launch of his [[War on Terror|anti-terrorism campaign]] in the form "Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-a-2001-09-21-14-bush-66411197/549664.html Bush: 'You Are Either With Us, Or With the Terrorists' - 2001-09-21], ''[[Voice of America]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The statement generally is a descriptive statement identifying the beliefs of the speaker(s), and thus state a basic assumption, not a logical conclusion. It may also be interpreted as a [[speech act]]. Sometimes but not always interpreted as a [[splitting (psychology)|splitting]] or a  [[false dilemma]], which is an [[informal fallacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/black-or-white|title=Your logical fallacy is black or white|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some see the statement as a way of persuading others to choose sides in a conflict which does not allow the position of [[Neutral country|neutrality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Only when there are no alternatives like a [[middle ground]] does the phrase hold validity as a logical conclusion. The phrases are a form of argumentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Historical quotations ===
&lt;!--Chronological order please--&gt;
* From the [[Book of Joshua]] [[S:Bible (World English)/Joshua#Chapter 5|(Chap. 5:13)]]: "It happened, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand. Joshua went to him, and said to him, 'Are you for us, or for our adversaries?{{'"}}
* The [[Synoptic Gospels]] attribute the following quote to [[Jesus]]: "Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters" (Matthew 12:30), as well as its [[contrapositive]], "Whoever is not against us is for us" (Luke 9:50; Mark 9:40).&lt;ref&gt;New Revised Standard Version&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]], in an oration before [[Julius Caesar]] in 46 BCE, published as [[Pro Ligario]], made the following distinction: "For we heard you say that we looked upon all as enemies that were not with us; but that you looked upon all as friends that were not against you."&lt;ref&gt;Pro Ligario 11 (33), translation from {{cite book|first1= Marcus Tullius|last1=Cicero|first2=William|last2=Duncan|title=Cicero's Select Orations, Translated Into English|publisher=Sidney's Press|year=1811}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vladimir Ilyich Lenin]], in a speech discussing the Chief Committee for Political Education, told the assembled delegates that "It is with absolute frankness that we speak of this struggle of the proletariat; each man must choose between joining our side or the other side. Any attempt to avoid taking sides in this issue must end in fiasco."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/nov/03.htm] Speech Delivered At An All-Russia Conference Of Political Education Workers Of Gubernia and Uyezd Education Departments November 3, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[George Orwell]] wrote in his 1942 essay "Pacifism and the War", "If you hamper the war effort of one side you automatically help that of the other. Nor is there any real way of remaining outside such a war as the present one. In practice, 'he that is not with me is against me'. The idea that you can somehow remain aloof from and superior to the struggle, while living on food which British sailors have to risk their lives to bring you, is a bourgeois illusion bred of money and security."
* [[Benito Mussolini]] declared in speeches across fascist Italy:  "O con noi o contro di noi"—You're either with us or against us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilduce.net/motti.htm|title=Il Duce: Benito Mussolini e La Storia del Fascismo - Frasi e Motti|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[János Kádár]], in an effort to unite Hungary after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], announced in December 1961, "those who are not against us are with us."
* Common form of [[Cold War]] terminology. On 30 September 1970, the ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel#Milwaukee Journal|Milwaukee Journal]]'' quoted a police [[official]] of the [[Greek military junta of 1967–74]] as saying to his [[political prisoner]]s: "You make yourself ridiculous{{sic}} by thinking you can do anything. The word is divided in two. The [[Russia]]ns and the [[United States|America]]ns, no one else. What are we? Americans. Behind me there is the government, behind the government is [[NATO]], behind NATO is the US.

=== In literature and popular culture ===
* In the movie ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', Gaston tells fellow citizens of his village that "If you're not with us, you're against us," and thereafter locks up Belle and her father so he can hunt the Beast.
* In the ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' movie ''[[Magnum Force]]'', one of the suspects tells [[Harry Callahan (character)|Harry Callahan]], "Either you're for us or you're against us."
* In the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] of the [[film]] ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]'', Anakin Skywalker (aka [[Darth Vader]]) says to [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], "If you're not with me, then you're my enemy." Obi-Wan responds, "Only a [[Sith]] deals in absolutes." His response is an absolute statement, although linguists are divided as to whether the "deals" part of the phrase makes this not a contradictory statement.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}
* Towards the end of [[Joseph Heller]]'s ''[[Catch-22]]'', Colonels Korn and Cathcart equate fighting for their country with fighting for the benefit of the two of them. Korn tells the protagonist Yossarian: "You're either for us or against your country. It's as simple as that." A reviewer of ''Catch-22'' found this "flawless" logical indulgence by the commanding colonels to be comparable to Heller's parody of [[Charles Erwin Wilson]]'s statement, often paraphrased as, "[[Charles Erwin Wilson#Secretary of Defense|What's good for General Motors is good for the country]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=War Stars: The Superweapon and the American Imagination|author=H.

* In a 1912 edition of ''[[John Bull's Other Island]]'' by [[George Bernard Shaw]], an advertisement for ''[[The Clarion]]'', a socialist newspaper, used the phrase to attract those interested in the debate on [[socialism]].
* In the movie ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', the protagonist meets with his childhood friend Messala. He has barely said hello to Ben-Hur when he is dunning him for the names of those Jews who are speaking out against the Roman occupation. Ben-Hur refuses to act as informer, and Messala utters, "You're either with me or against me".
*In Act III of Arthur Miller's ''[[The Crucible]]'', Deputy Governor John Danforth states, "But you must understand, sir, that a person is either with this court or he must be counted against it, there is no road between."
* A professional wrestling faction in [[WWE]], called [[The Nexus (professional wrestling)|The Nexus]], used the slogan "You're either Nexus, or you're against us".
* [[Stephen Colbert]] has parodied the sentence on several occasions, for instance with "Either you are for the war [in Iraq] or you hate America" and "George W. Bush: great president or the greatest president?", after which he usually adds "It's that simple!"&lt;ref name="Sinnott-ArmstrongFogelin2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Walter Sinnott-Armstrong|author2=Robert J.

* In the ''[[Smallville]]'' episode "Shattered", [[Lex Luthor]] tells [[Clark Kent]], "You're either with me or against me, Clark. Choose right now."
* In the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)|''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' 2003 TV series]] episode "The Shredder Strikes, Part One" [[The Shredder]] tells the Turtles "Those who are not with me are against me, and I crush anyone who stands against me!" right before facing them for the first time.
* In the film ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'', [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Dr. Klaus Schmidt / Sebastian Shaw]] tells the [[X-Men]], "If you are not with us, then by definition, you are against us."
* ''[[Futurama]]'' makes a parody of this concept, when the character Zapp Brannigan expresses disdain about the members of the Neutral Planet who didn't take side in a conflict by commenting concerns like "With enemies you know where they stand but with neutrals? Who knows? It sickens me" or "What makes a man turn neutral? Lust for gold? Power? Or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality?"
